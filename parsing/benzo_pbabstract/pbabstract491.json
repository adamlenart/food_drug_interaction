    "0": "The role of the pituitary-adrenal axis on receptor binding and diurnal rhythmicity of benzodiazepines (BNZ) was assessed in the rat cerebral cortex. Groups of intact, adrenalectomized (ADx) and/or hypophysectomized (HPx) rats were killed at six different time intervals during the 24-hour cycle. BNZ binding was estimated by Scatchard analysis of 3H-flunitrazepam high-affinity binding to rat cerebral cortex. Intact and sham ADx animals show a similar pattern in diurnal thythm of BNZ binding, with a maximal concentration at midnight. Bilateral ADx induced a significant increase in Bmax at all time intervals studied, the largest rise appearing at midnight. HPx alone led to a slightly smaller rise in Bmax than in ADx rats, while HPx performed in ADx rats did not modify the response to ADx alone. Bmax of BNZ binding in ADx rats reached maximal values at 3-7 days after surgery, and decreased somewhat at 15 days post-ADx. Corticosterone administration at a single dose of 5 mg i.p. 24 h before sacrifice returned Bmax to normal values in ADx as well as in ADx plus HPx rats. The corticosterone effect is not exerted on the BNZ binding sites themselves, as revealed by the lack of effect of this glucocorticoid in vitro. These findings indicate that BNZ receptors in rat cerebral cortex can be modified by the adrenal gland, with corticosterone as a primary effector.", 
    "1": "Alterations in brain high energy phosphate compounds, using 31P-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, were measured in vivo in young adult (3-4 months) rats following prenatal exposure to ligands acting specifically at benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding sites. The exposure induced a decrease in intracellular pH that indicated a predominant interaction of the drugs in utero with central-type BDZ receptor sites. Late gestational exposure to BDZ ligands also induced changes in brain phosphocreatine (PCr) utilization. Exposure to the lowest dose of DZ (1.0 mg/kg) but not the higher dose (2.5 mg/kg) induced a significant change in PCr utilization. Exposure to the central-type BDZ receptor antagonist RO15-1788 alone clearly altered PCr utilization in adult offspring, and DZ (2.5 mg/kg) when administered concurrently was not able to prevent this effect. Though exposure to a peripheral-type ligand (PK11195) had no effect by itself, it converted the effect of the high dose of DZ to that of the low dose. Together, these results indicate an interaction during development between the central and peripheral-type BDZ binding sites on organization and/or regulation of cellular energy metabolism. Normalized ATP levels were not changed by any prenatal treatment indicating adequate buffering of intracellular ATP by phosphocreatine. The dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol did not alter intracellular pH or any index of phosphate metabolism indicating a selective receptor mediated role for BDZ ligands in influences on the long term organization of intracellular phosphate metabolism.", 
    "2": "Phenobarbital (PhB) was administered to pregnant mice during days 9-18 of gestation. [3H]Muscimol binding to cerebellum, [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebellum and olfactory bulb, and [3H]PK 11195 binding to olfactory bulb, heart and kidney were assay in the of offspring at 22 and 50 days of age. The chronic prenatal administration of PhB did not affect either gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, central benzodiazepine receptors (CBR), or peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) in these tissues. In the next stage of the study, we investigated a possible modulatory effect of chronic postnatal PhB treatment during days 2-21 of age on the same receptors measured at 22 and 50 days of age. PhB exposure of neonates resulted in a significant down-regulation of GABA receptors and CBR in the cerebellum and of PBS in the heart. The effects were demonstrated on day 22 of age and were undetectable by day 50 of age. CBR at the olfactory bulb and PBS at the olfactory bulb and kidney were not altered by the drug treatment. It is concluded that in utero exposure to PhB does not affect benzodiazepine receptor ontogenesis, and the effects of postnatal treatment are transitory only.", 
    "3": "Response to drugs in the elderly may be accentuated or modified by age related changes in homeostatic mechanisms such as postural control, orthostatic circulatory responses, thermoregulation, visceral muscle function and higher cognitive function. Changes in specific receptor and target organ responses have also been described. beta-Adrenoceptor-mediated effects are apparently attenuated by a reduction in high affinity binding sites and altered post receptor mechanisms resembling desensitization. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor and cholinergic effects may also be attenuated though there is no evidence for altered alpha 1-adrenoceptor sensitivity. The effects of age on sensitivity to benzodiazepines, calcium channel blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulants and cardiac glycosides are also discussed. There is a major requirement for further work in this field.", 
    "4": "Using [3H]flunitrazepam as a probe for the benzodiazepine-sensitive modulator site located on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex, we have investigated the cellular regulation of the GABAA receptor in neuronal cultures derived from embryonic chick brain. Treatment of cultures with 1 mM GABA for 48 hr causes a reversible 35% decrease in the number of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites with no change in affinity. The EC50 for chronic GABA-induced down-regulation is 94 microM and the half-time is 25 hr. The effect of GABA is blocked by SR-95531, a GABAA receptor antagonist, and mimicked by muscimol but not baclofen. Consistent with the decrease in [3H]flunitrazepam binding, chronic GABA exposure causes a 43% decrease in the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, a ligand for the receptor-associated chloride ionophore. In addition to chronic GABA-induced down-regulation, allosteric interactions between GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites are uncoupled by 34%. The half-time and pharmacology for chronic GABA-induced uncoupling is indistinguishable from that for GABA-induced down-regulation, consistent with the hypothesis that the action of GABA at a common site induces both down-regulation and uncoupling.", 
    "5": "Ivermectin, a potent, effective anthelmintic, is easy to administer, has a broad spectrum of action and a wide safety margin. However, no testing has been done in hosts genetically selected for seizure susceptibility which may be more sensitive to the effects of ivermectin than other animals. This was done in the present experiments with seizure prone and seizure resistant mice infested with Syphacia obvelata (pinworm). These subjects were treated daily with oral ivermectin in their drinking water every other week for six weeks, for a total of 21 days. The treatment cleared the mice of the pinworm infestation, but did not alter the seizure susceptibility or binding parameters of [3H]flunitrazepam in either of the selected lines.", 
    "6": "Interactions between different noradrenaline (NA)-active drugs and the benzodiazepine alprazolam (APZ) were examined in a modified Vogel's drinking conflict test in the rat. In a dose (0.5 mg/kg) which did not alter the behavior by itself, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine consistently was found to enhance the anticonflict effect of APZ (0.5 mg/kg). The yohimbine induced potentiation of the APZ effect was counteracted both by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.25 mg/kg) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.0 mg/kg), but not by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (2.0 mg/kg). Similar potentiating phenomena were obtained after co-administration of APZ (0.5 mg/kg) with the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist ST 587 (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) as well as with the suggested beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol (1.0 mg/kg). The results indicate that the potentiative effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists on BDZ induced anticonflict action may be due to increased stimulation of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, via enhanced NA release. The findings are discussed in relation to the signal-to-noise hypothesis of NA function, and in relation to the suggested NA involvement in anxiety-related behavior.", 
    "7": "The potential antidepressant dihydroergosine enhanced the convulsive properties of picrotoxin and bicuculline in rats and diminished them in mice. The possibility of dihydroergosine modulating species-dependently GABA/benzodiazepine receptors is suggested.", 
    "8": "Tifluadom, a kappa-opioid agonist and cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) receptor antagonist, was utilized as a model to prepare a series of 2-(aminomethyl)- and 3-(aminomethyl)-1,4-benzodiazepines. These compounds were tested in vitro as inhibitors of the binding of [125I]CCK to rat pancreas and guinea pig brain receptors. All compounds with IC50's less than 100 microM proved to have greater affinity for the CCK-A receptor, with the most potent analogue, 6e, having an IC50 of 0.16 microM. The benzodiazepines described in this study are simultaneously CCK-A and opioid receptor ligands. The ramification of this dichotomy on current concepts of peptide hormone action are discussed. These results further demonstrate the versatility of the benzodiazepine core structure for designing nonpeptide ligands for peptide receptors and the ability to fine-tune the receptor interactions of these benzodiazepines by appropriate structure modifications.", 
    "9": "Benzodiazepine binding was measured in amygdala and hippocampus from 19 suicides in whom a firm diagnosis of depression was established retrospectively, and 19 well-matched controls. The number and affinity of benzodiazepine binding sites did not differ significantly between the drug-free or drug-treated suicides and controls.", 
    "10": "Two types of benzodiazepine receptors have been identified in mammalian tissues: a central type which is localized to neuronal elements in the brain, and a peripheral type which is present on glial cells and in tissues outside the central nervous system such as kidney. The authors report an increase in specific binding of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands in certain human brain tumors using computer assisted quantitative image analysis of autoradiograms. Higher densities of binding sites to a 3H-labeled selective peripheral benzodiazepine ligand, PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide] were observed in human gliomas as the malignancy of these tumors increased. Specific binding was also present in some non-glial tumors but little binding was demonstrated in necrotic tissue or normal brain. In in vitro binding studies in rats, there was a significant increase in Bmax (1089.3 +/- 232.2 fmol/mg tissue) in C6 glial tumors and LK Walker 256 metastatic tumors (924.2 +/- 183.7) compared with normal brain (62.1 +/- 12.8 fmol/mg tissue). Binding affinities were, however, similar (Kd = 2.09, 2.17, and 2.04 nmol/l, respectively). These findings suggest that the number of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are increased in brain tumors. These receptors could be utilized in positron emission tomography to image brain tumors.", 
    "11": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expression and function in cultured rat neostriatal neurons were examined. All experiments were performed on intact neurons grown in vitro for 12-14 days. The muscarinic antagonist N-[3H]methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS) binds to a single site in cultures with a KD of 89 pM and a Bmax of 187 fmol/mg of protein, or 32,000 sites/neuron. Competition studies using [3H]NMS were performed to determine what receptor subtypes were present. Nonlinear analysis of competition curves was best described with a single binding site for atropine, pirenzepine, and AF-DX 116 (11-[[2-[(diethylamino)-methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one), with Ki values of 0.6, 62, and 758 nM, respectively. These results indicate that the muscarinic receptors present in neostriatal cultures are of the M1 subtype, having high affinity for pirenzepine and low affinity for AF-DX 116. In contrast with antagonists, carbachol displaced [3H]NMS from two sites with Ki values of 6.5 and 147 microM, with the higher-affinity form predominant (83% of sites). The M1 receptor subtype was linked to phosphoinositide turnover. Carbachol stimulated the formation of phosphoinositides with an EC50 of 37 microM and was antagonized by atropine. At equimolar doses, pirenzepine was more potent than AF-DX 116 at antagonizing the response.", 
    "12": "The postnatal development of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptor (GABAR/BZDR) complex of the rat brain has been investigated using the monoclonal antibody 62-3G1 and the polyclonal rabbit antiserum A, specific for the 57,000 and 51,000 Mr receptor subunits, respectively. Both GABAR and BZDR binding activities co-precipitated during all postnatal ages. Adult rats showed a main 51,000 Mr[3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity-labeled peptide, whereas newborn rats showed several photolabeled peptides of higher Mr. All the photolabeled peptides could be immunoprecipitated with each antibody regardless of the age of the rats. These results suggest that the physical coupling between the GABAR and the BZDR is already present in newborn animals and it is maintained afterwards during development. Glycosidase and peptidase treatments of the immunoprecipitated GABAR/BZDR complex indicated that all the [3H]flunitrazepam-photolabeled subunits are different peptides, although they seem to conserve a high degree of homology. In addition to the age-dependent heterogeneity, the results also suggest that for each age, there is heterogeneity in the subunit composition of the GABAR/BZDR complex.", 
    "13": "The muscarinic receptor subtype involved in human airway smooth muscle contraction was characterised for the first time, using subtype-selective muscarinic antagonists. It was demonstrated that methacholine-induced contraction of central (trachea) and peripheral (small bronchi) airway smooth muscle preparations was antagonised by pirenzepine, AF-DX 116, 4-DAMP methobromide, hexahydrosiladifenidol, and methoctramine with pA2-values characteristic of M3 (smooth muscle/glandular) muscarinic receptors. Since these pA2-values demonstrate significant correlations with those found in bovine and guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle contraction, it is concluded that these animal tissues provide a good model for the study of M3 subtype-selective muscarinic antagonists to be used as bronchodilators.", 
    "14": "The anticonvulsant effects of two doses of clonazepam (CZP, Rivotril Roche, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) were studied on model motor seizures induced by strychnine, bicuculline, 3-mercaptopropionic acid and metrazol in male laboratory rats (Wistar strain). In the first part the effects of different doses of the convulsants were investigated and for interaction with CZP doses were chosen after which more than 70% of the animals displayed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions (a grand mal seizure). Strychnine induced this type of seizure only: two doses (2 and 3 mg/kg s.c.) were used. CZP reduced the incidence of convulsions only after the larger dose, but plain solvent (propylene glycol, ethanol, water) was equally effective. The other substances first induced a seizure of minimal (mainly clonic) convulsions and only later a grand mal seizure. CZP was highly effective against bicuculline (3 mg/kg s.c.) and metrazol (100 mg/kg s.c.), but was less so against 3-mercaptopropionic acid. The effect on grand mal seizures was more pronounced in every case than on minimal seizures. The decisive role in the anticonvulsant effect of CZP is played by the mechanisms by which the convulsants induce epileptic manifestations. CZP is most effective against substances acting on the supramolecular complex GABA receptor (benzodiazepine receptor) chloride ionophore (bicuculline and probably metrazol).", 
    "15": "Diazepam was administered by infusion to three groups of rats with an induced differentiated total lipid content in their lymph (unfed, fed, oil-fed) and its lymph/blood concentration ratios in the steady state were determined. Ratio values were highest in the group with the highest lymph lipid content (the oil-fed group, 2.20 +/- 0.08) and fell significantly in the other groups (fed group 1.46 +/- 0.09, unfed group 1.15 +/- 0.05). The areas under the blood and lymph concentration curves after the intravenous (i.v.) and intraduodenal (i.d.) administration of diazepam were used to determine absolute (F) and lymphatic (FL) bioavailability. The F value in the blood can be raised by increasing the amount of lipids, whereas in the lymph, under the same conditions, it falls. During the i.v. and i.d. administration of diazepam, FL always rises with an increase in the amount of lipids in the lymph. The role played by the lymphatic system in total diazepam absorption was determined from the experimental results of its i.d. administration. The absolute values are very low (0.043-0.316%), but are significantly influenced by the presence of lipids.", 
    "16": "Our hypothesis that the strong effects of neutropic drugs on nervous system have hidden more widespread effects on all tissues and cells, is collecting evidences in our laboratory. We have essayed in vitro benzodiazepines on liver rat mitochondria. The present work deals with experiments on diazepam: it depresses the respiration coupled to phorphorylation in mitochondria having a good respiratory control; so respiratory control too is depressed. Also P/O ratio is lowered.", 
    "17": "The Marks-Sheehan anxiety scales are the only scales where self-ratings and observer ratings are perfectly matched by the number, the content and the scaling of the items. Therefore these scales are an excellent tool to investigate the compatibility and to study different structures in self- and observer ratings. This was done by using the data material on the Marks-Sheehan scales of the Cross National Collaborative Panic Study. In this study 1168 outpatients who met the DSM-III criteria for panic disorder were randomly allocated either to alprazolam, imipramine or placebo treatment. Our results show that the Marks-Sheehan scales are highly comparable to other established rating scales. Both scales have a similar stable and consistent factor pattern for somatic symptoms but not for psychic symptoms of anxiety. Our results provide empirical evidence that the low consistencies between self- and observer ratings reported so far can be improved by using a rating scale which matches up item for self- and observer ratings. However, other sources of disagreement can only be solved by more elaborated item descriptions and training of patients as well as raters to obtain a better compatibility between self- and observer rating scales.", 
    "18": "Self-rating scales are considered to be less useful for comparing different treatments in anxiety patients than observer-rating scales. However, the empirical evidence for this assumption is not adequate. A self-rating inventory of 35 items related to anxiety was perfectly parallel with an observer-rating inventory. Both instruments were used in the Cross National Collaborative Panic Study to compare the efficacy of imipramine, alprazolam and placebo in an 8-week drug trial in a sample of 1168 outpatients. The variance of the self-rating assessments was about two times higher. Both scales were equally sensitive to change; however, the measurement of change by means of the self-rating scale was slightly less consistent. The discriminative power of the observer-rating scale between placebo and active treatment was two to three times higher than that of the self-rating scale; consequently the observer-rating procedure provides a more valid instrument when the efficacies of different anxiolytic treatments are compared between different groups of patients.", 
    "19": "Previously, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and buspirone and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 have been shown to exert anxiolytic-like effects in several animal models. In the experiments reported here the effects of these compounds on feeding behaviour and food preference in a novel environment were examined, and compared with the effects of the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide and the anxiogenic compound FG 7142. Chlordiazepoxide significantly reduced the latency to begin eating and prolonged the total time spent eating; chlordiazepoxide also abolished food neophobia, by significantly increasing the time spent eating novel food items. In contrast, FG 7142 significantly increased eating latency and reduced eating duration. Both 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone significantly enhanced eating duration, but unlike chlordiazepoxide eating was directed only towards the familiar food. In addition buspirone, but not 8-OH-DPAT, reduced eating latency. ICS 205-930 significantly increased eating latency and reduced eating duration; however, these effects were observed only at the lowest dose tested. All of these behavioural effects were observed only when animals were unfamiliar with the testing situation, and cannot be accounted for in terms of changes in mechanisms controlling hunger. The behavioural paradigm used in these experiments may induce a competition between the drives to explore a novel environment and to eat. It is suggested that the tendency of buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT to suppress exploratory activity may thus result in enhanced feeding duration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The behavioural specificity of the hyperphagic effects of 8-OH-DPAT is a controversial issue. The present study addressed this question through the introduction of behavioural competition. Feeding behaviour in male mice was assessed under both basal (free-feeding) and social conflict conditions. Since, in the latter condition, defence and escape are prepotent responses, elicitation of feeding would be indicative of a specific treatment effect on mechanisms controlling food intake. Results showed that 8-OH-DPAT enhanced basal feeding duration (at doses of 0.05-0.50 mg/kg) and also elicited feeding in intruder mice during encounters with aggressive resident conspecifics (at doses of 0.10-0.50 mg/kg). As the 5-HT3 antagonist GR38032F (1.0-2.0 mg/kg) enhanced feeding only under basal conditions, the effect of 8-OH-DPAT cannot readily be attributed to anxiety reduction. Finally, diazepam (1.0-2.0 mg/kg) produced a similar profile to that of 8-OH-DPAT, suggesting that the hyperphagic effects of the 5-HT1A agonist are not pharmacologically specific.", 
    "21": "During 5 years 382 laparoscopies were carried through in female patients with sterility in different kinds of anaesthesia (Intubation anaesthesia, spinal anaesthesia, and i.v. anaesthesia). We found the most advantageous results in the cases of i.v. anaesthesia with Ketamin and Diazepam.", 
    "22": "Although diazepam has been shown to reduce the stress response, the protective effect of midazolam, a newer benzodiazepine from a stressful event, tracheal intubation, has not been studied as yet by catecholamine assays in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, who also receive intravenous sufentanil as a component of the neuroleptanalgesic technique. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of midazolam in combination with sufentanil on the plasma free catecholamines before and after midazolam, after sufentanil and pancuronium and before and after intubation in 15 adult patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. After routine premedication, midazolam 0.14 +/- 0.01 mg.kg-1 i.v. was given over 1 min followed 5 min later by sufentanil in incremental i.v. doses of 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 to a total pre-intubation dose of 4.0-5.0 micrograms.kg-1 injected in 10 min. The incremental doses of sufentanil were given when a greater than 15 per cent increase in rate-pressure product occurred. One min after the initial dose of sufentanil, pancuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 i.v. was given to provide muscle relaxation. Midazolam administration per se caused a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures with a concomitant reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Sufentanil reduced the left ventricular stroke-work index. Tracheal intubation, a strong stressor during anesthesia, elicited no increase in catecholamines and/or adverse hemodynamic responses in contrast to a marked increase in plasma catecholamines routinely observed in patients anesthetized by the commonly used technique of intravenous barbiturates in combination with succinylcholine.", 
    "23": "This study was designed to compare the antidepressant effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline in a group of 30 inpatients suffering from a severe major endogenous depression, diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria and the Newcastle Rating scale, and to examine the effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline on two biological markers of depression, the dexamethasone suppression test and sleep EEG parameters. The 6-week study was double-blind with a random allocation of treatment. Patients were treated with flexible doses of 4-9 mg of alprazolam and 100-225 mg of amitriptyline. After 4 weeks of treatment the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline significantly exceeded those of alprazolam, as measured on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. There was a high drop-out rate in the alprazolam group because of ineffectiveness of treatment. Alprazolam showed similar effects on sleep parameters as amitriptyline: lengthening of the REM latency and a tendency to shorten stages 3 and 4 and stage REM. These negative clinical results should be interpreted with caution, because of the severity of our selection criteria, and should not be extended to all depressive disorders.", 
    "24": "Details are reported of 41 incidents where women reported fantasies during sedation with IV midazolam or diazepam: 27 of them had some sexual element and 20 were unpleasant experiences. The events occurred in a logical sequence and all were certain of their authenticity. Some led to litigation against the sedationist. Out of 25 verified reports made by patients of incidents occurring during sedation, 17 did not happen and in 9/13 clear descriptions there was some relation between the fantasy and something that really happened under sedation. All occurred with what are now considered large doses of the drugs. During or following sedation lady patients should not be treated or examined without the presence of a responsible third person. The use of the injectable benzodiazepines, diazepam and more recently midazolam, with their sedative, amnesic and relaxing properties have made unpleasant operative procedures, particularly those usually carried out under local analgesia, more acceptable to many patients. These include oral endoscopy and dental procedures and operations under spinal or epidural analgesia. These drugs also provide good sedation during ventilatory support and in the intensive care unit. Over a long period of time these benzodiazepines have proven to be, in appropriate doses, among the safest in medicine for short term use. There have however been a few cases of what can be described as \"fantasies\" occurring during sedation: events occurring in a logical sequence which are very real to the patient and yet, on the evidence of two or more independent witnesses, did not occur. Many of these have had an element of sexual trespass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The phenomenology of panic attacks and of complex partial seizures overlap, and at times distinguishing between the two entities is difficult. The authors report five patients with recurrent panic attacks and temporal lobe EEG abnormalities whose symptoms did not warrant a clinical diagnosis of partial seizures but who responded well to anticonvulsant therapy. The cases suggest that focal cortical discharges may trigger panic attacks in some patients in whom an unequivocal diagnosis of epilepsy cannot be made. Electroencephalography and anticonvulsant trials may be appropriate in patients with panic attacks refractory to conventional treatment.", 
    "26": "Consumption of alcohol and tranquilizers reaches a very high level in France. Studies about simultaneous alcohol and psychotropic drugs involvement in motor related fatalities have never been described in this country. A retrospective study was done on 482 fatalities broken down by drivers and pedestrians within one year (1987) in R\u00e9gion Nord-Pas de Calais (France).", 
    "27": "132 cases met the criteria for complete study. Blood samples obtained at the time of death were analysed for alcohol (BAC) by gas-chromatography and assayed for barbiturates (BA), benzodiazepines (BE) and tricyclic antidepressants (TA) by Emit.", 
    "28": "Out of 132 fatalities there were 86% men (mean age 38.5 years) and 14% women (mean age 46 years). 57% belonged to the working population. Of the fatalities, 38% occurred from Friday 8 p.m. to Sunday 12 p.m. We distinguished 3 categories: pedestrians (18.2%), 2-wheel vehicles (19%) and 4-wheel vehicles (62.8%). Alcohol involvement is given in Table 2. [table: see text] Notice that 53% were above the legal limit (0.8 g/l) and 34.8% had no alcohol. Psychotropic drugs were detected in 10.6% of the cases (Table 3). [table: see text] BZ were found in 50% of men and 100% of women. drugs and alcohol were present simultaneously in 8.3% of the individuals. Results are in % of total in Table 4: [table: see text] Positive BAC and positive drugs are not related. No significant difference was found in the distribution of alcohol between positive or negative drugs findings. Our results are consistent with those described by North-American authors, but largely superior to those from French or other studies done only on injured persons.", 
    "29": "The effect of an M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist telenzepine on lung function was investigated in 18 patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis in a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. FEV1, FEF50, PEF and FVC were measured every 0.5 h up to 2 h, then every 1 h up to 6 h after administration of a single, oral dose of 5 mg in the morning. Compared with placebo, telenzepine increased (time average over 6 hours; median and 68%-range): 1) FEV1 from 1.46 (0.81, 2.06) to 1.67 (1.06, 2.40) l, p less than 0.01; 2) PEF from 3.58 (2.33, 4.55) to 3.88 (3.10, 5.07) l/s, p less than 0.01; 3) FEF50 from 0.93 (0.45, 1.58) to 1.17 (0.67, 1.90) l/s, p less than 0.001. Whereas the median increase in FEV1 15 min after 2 puffs of salbutamol was 20% (range 15 to 74%), FEV1 improved by 32% (range -15 to 130%) at the time of maximum difference between placebo and telenzepine. The heart rate did not change. We conclude that in patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis substantial improvement of lung function parameters can be achieved by an M1-receptor antagonist. It is possible that with the dose administered direct actions on muscarinic receptors on the smooth muscle (M3) contribute to the observed bronchodilatation. The unchanged heart rate indicates little effect on cardiac M2-receptors.", 
    "30": "The anxiolytic activity, the tolerance, and the withdrawal symptoms of buspirone and oxazepam were compared in two groups of 14 and 12 outpatients, respectively, suffering from generalized anxiety in a double-blind study with random allocation of patients. The 6-week active period was preceded and followed by 1 and 2 weeks on placebo, respectively. Clinical assessments were performed before and after the predrug placebo period and every 2 weeks thereafter and included Hamilton anxiety and depression scales and AMDP anxiety subscale. The initial daily dose was 15 mg buspirone or 45 mg oxazepam in 3 intakes and the mean final daily doses were 22.2 and 55.8 mg, respectively. Results showed a slower anxiolytic activity of buspirone compared to oxazepam with less improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. The rebound anxiety following abrupt discontinuation of the drug and the level of side effects did not significantly differ between the two compounds.", 
    "31": "Experiments were performed in the adult normotensive rats of Wistar strain and in the genetically hypertensive rats of Koletsky type; measurements were carried out in both sexes. The behaviour of control and drug treated rats were traced in the holeboard and in the elevated plus-maze. In the control animals when compared to the normotensive rats of both sexes, the genetically hypertensive rats of both sexes show increased aversion towards open space and high in the elevated plus-maze (when the number of visits of centre and open arms is considered in the first session); the latter type of rats also show elevated total time of locomotor-exploratory activity in both sessions, reduced rate of intra-session habituation of locomotor-exploratory activity in both sessions, and decreased percentage of time spent head dipping in both sessions. Tranylcypromine treatment at the dose 5 mg/kg b. w. increased number of visits in centre and in open arms only in the second session in the normotensive males, and this drug shows decrease in the latter parameter in the second session in the genetically hypertensive females. Tranylcypromine increased time spent in centre and in open arms in the first session only in the genetically hypertensive males, in the second session this drug shows increase in time spent in centre and in open arms in the normotensive females and decrease in the genetically hypertensive females. Caffeine treatment at the dose 10 mg/kg b. w. remained without effect in both strains of rats and in both sessions in the elevated plus-maze, except the decrease in the number of entries in centre and in open arms in the first session in the normotensive females. Diazepam treatment at the dose 1 mg/kg b. w. shows \"anxiolytic\" effect i.e., increase number of visits and time spent in centre and in open arms in both sessions and in both sexes of the genetically hypertensive rats. Thus diazepam shown its \"anxiolytic\" effect in very profound and stable manner only in the animals which show CNS neurotransmitter abnormalities reminding the CNS neurochemical abnormalities in human forms of depression and anxiety. It is worthwhile to note that diazepam only in the latter mentioned strain of rats very profoundly elevates the percentage of time spent head dipping. Thus this drug elevates the reactivity towards stimuli which show biological sense for the rats, i. e., to look up the small and dark space. This type of reaction is decreased in the genetically hypertensive rats of both sexes relative to the control normotensive rats of Wistar strain.", 
    "32": "Since chronic flumazenil treatment was previously found to stimulate exploratory behavior in rodents, the aim of this study was to test the effect of chronic exposure to flumazenil on acquisition and retention of escape behavior. Adult rats were treated with flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; 4 mg/kg/day in drinking water) for 21 days (experiment 1) and for 17 days (experiment 2). In experiment 1 (a round water tank with one escape rope) conducted 24 h after drug/vehicle withdrawal, the time the animals needed to resolve a swim-escape task was significantly shorter in the drug group, compared to the controls. In the retention trial, 24 h later, the control group matched the performance of the drug group. In experiment 2, a water T-maze was used which was equipped with two ropes, one anchored to the bottom and the other unanchored and therefore was more difficult to climb. On day 14 of flumazenil/vehicle treatment, there were no differences between the groups in the time needed to escape from the maze. However, on day 15 and 16 of drug/vehicle treatment, the drug group made highly significant progress, while the control group showed no improvement of the escape behavior. The possible mechanisms of flumazenil-induced facilitation of escape behavior have been discussed.", 
    "33": "The characteristics of the power density spectra of the frontal and occipital cortical EEG between 1 and 31 Hz as well as the total power of the neck muscle EMG during an 8-second epoch were used to differentiate 8 vigilance stages in normal rats. The following stages and the time spent within these stages during a 6-hour recording (9.00-15.00) were evaluated: waking with active EMG (about 127 min), waking (7 +/- 3 min), theta-waking (25.5 +/- 9 min), classical sleep I (dozing; 107 +/- 11 min), classical sleep II (41 +/- 6 min), paradoxical sleep (PS; 30 +/- 9 min), transitional phase (PS spindles; 9.5 +/- 4 min) and transitional dozing (13 +/- 3 min). Two additional stages were differentiated in rats suffering from petit mal: paroxysmally occurring spikes and waves and an especially marked transitional phase. The absolute power spectra of these vigilance stages (except active waking) were plotted as well as the statistically analyzed deviations from the mean power spectra of all epochs without active EMG. A comparison between the mean power spectra of a control recording and a recording after oral application of 10 mg/kg diazepam indicates that these differences are less marked than between the vigilance stages.", 
    "34": "In a randomized single-blind cross-over study on 14 volunteers the relation between dose, effect and serum concentration was studied when diazepam in solution was administered in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight rectally with the volunteer placed either laterally or prone. When lying prone the delivered diazepam dose was on average 24% higher compared to in the lateral position. The difference in delivered dose affected sedation as well as serum concentration but did not prolong recovery time. At the time of clinical recovery, the serum concentration was still at a very high level. Oxygen (p02) and carbon dioxide (pCO2) tensions were monitored transcutaneously in 9 subjects and were unaffected by the sedative level. The study suggests that when diazepam enemas similar to the ones used here, they should be administered with the patient in a prone position.", 
    "35": "In animal studies as well as in a few cases in humans, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil has been shown to reverse hepatic encephalopathy. The authors treated 3 patients with acute hepatic encephalopathy stage III or IV complicating cirrhosis. Two patients had an immediate recovery, maintained with a continuous infusion of flumazenil. In the third patient the clinical status dit not improve but the hepatic encephalopathy coexisted with major abnormalities in blood gases and electrolytes abnormalities, which could participate to the neurologic failure.", 
    "36": "Anaesthesia with dormicum-anexat were carried out on 38 women with abdominal gynecological operations. Furthermore a group of 32 women with induced interruption of pregnancy was studied as well. Time of sleeping and clinical parameters respiration, arterial blood pressure, changes in acid-base balance before and after induction in anaesthesia were examined. The effect of dormicum was neutralized by anexat in all women. An evaluation was made on the effect of anexat on waking, awareness and orientation of the patients. In the inferences the authors summarize their experience in usage of doricum-anexat.", 
    "37": "This study examined the effects of the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam and inverse agonist noreleagnine independently and in conjunction with the antagonist flumazenil in the mouse staircase test. According to this paradigm, the numbers of steps ascended (NSA) and rears (NR) reflect locomotor activity and anxiety, respectively. Midazolam reduced NR at doses that did not affect NSA; this NR-lowering effect was blocked by flumazenil. Noreleagnine increased NR at doses that did not affect NSA; this NR-elevating effect was also blocked by flumazenil. Effective antagonist doses of flumazenil alone had no effect on NR or NSA. The exactly opposite effects of midazolam and noreleagnine on NR and their antagonism by flumazenil are consistent with the postulated activities of these drugs at benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "38": "The research literature on alternative drug treatments to lithium therapy for the prevention of recurrences in bipolar disorders is discussed. In particular, the data on anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and valproic acid), antidepressants (alprazolam), and calcium channel blockers (verapamil) are reviewed and original data on clonazepam (CLN) are reported. In a preliminary study on six patients with bipolar disorders (DSM-III-R) without a history of psychotic features in which lithium prophylaxis was ineffective, contraindicated, or badly tolerated, CLN was administered in combination with low-dose neuroleptics or antidepressants in all but one case. All subjects were followed for 13 to 34 months. There were no relapses during the observation period with CLN dose regimens ranging from 1.5-8 mg/day p.o. Side effects were minimal and mostly consisted of transient sedation.", 
    "39": "L-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA; a preferential A1 adenosine agonist-0.05 mg/kg) offered no protection against electroconvulsions in mice but potentiated the anticonvulsant action of diazepam and valproate against maximal electroshock-induced seizures, decreasing the respective ED50 values from 9.5 to 4.0 mg/kg and from 250 to 185 mg/kg. However, it remained without effect on the protective activity of phenobarbital, carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin. 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA; a preferential A2 adenosine agonist-0.5 mg/kg) potentiated the efficacy of valproate. On the other hand, NECA (1 mg/kg) diminished the anticonvulsant action of phenobarbital (ED50 was elevated from 16.5 to 20.5 mg/kg), possessing no effect upon the protective action of carbamazepine. In addition, papaverine (20 mg/kg) significantly enhanced the protective efficacy of valproate and up to 40 mg/kg remained without influence upon the protective action of carbamazepine. However, papaverine (20 and 40 mg/kg) inhibited the anticonvulsive potential of phenobarbital. In the light of the results obtained A1 and A2 adenosine receptor-mediated events seem to possess different influences upon the protective effects of antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "40": "In a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective clinical trial we studied the efficacy and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). In the remaining 7 patients, needing two series of injections of flumazenil (up to 2.0 mg), GCS did not rise significantly and coma was related to intoxications with nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, flunitrazepam and in one patient, encephalitis. In the 10 patients receiving placebo, the GCS did not change. A significant increase in the GCS from 5.5 to 10.8 (p less than 0.001) was, however, observed when flumazenil (up to 1.0 mg) was given after placebo. In patients with EEG monitoring the changes in waveform pattern paralleled the clinical response. Effects could be detected within 1-2 min after flumazenil injection and lasted up to 45 min. There were no adverse reactions or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. The use of flumazenil is of diagnostic value in mixed-drug intoxications or coma of unknown origin and is of therapeutic importance for reversal of benzodiazepine intoxications.", 
    "41": "Flumazenil, the first benzodiazepine antagonist to be marketed, is available only for intravenous injection (0.1 mg/ml). The half-life of the compound in plasma is short compared with that of the conventional benzodiazepines, and administration of the drug as a continuous infusion is therefore frequently required. However, the stability of flumazenil in infusion solution has not previously been known, which has meant that controlled studies of the drug in this administration form have been difficult to perform. In the present study, infusion solutions of flumazenil in concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 micrograms/ml were produced and stored for periods of up to 9 months. The concentrations of the drug in the different solutions were determined by gas chromatography at defined intervals, and were found not to change during the study period. We conclude that the stability of flumazenil in infusion solution is satisfactory.", 
    "42": "A kinetic method is described for the estimation of neuroreceptor density as well as the rate constants for association and dissociation of rapidly equilibrating radioligands. The method is exemplified by positron emission tomographic measurements of the human brain using 11C-raclopride, a D 2 dopamine receptor antagonist, and 11C-Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Using a linear non iterative algorithm, regional binding characteristics were calculated and displayed pixel by pixel in brain maps. Data from repeated experiments on the same subject with different amounts of the unlabeled ligand were utilized. The binding characteristics were determined according to a two step procedure in which the time course of the free radioligand concentration was estimated from a reference region considered to be free of specific receptor binding sites. Alternative methods to determine the concentration of free radioligand are discussed.", 
    "43": "The \"security hypothesis\" suggests food hoarding by rats serves to preempt attack and therefore might be motivated by \"anxiety\". The \"object value\" hypothesis suggests rats hoard objects that they perceive as valuable as related to some state or need. These hypotheses were evaluated with the anxiolytic drug diazepam, which is purported to both decrease anxiety and increase motivation to eat, and which accordingly either may decrease or increase hoarding. Using a new hoarding paradigm, diazepam (Valium: 0.25-5 mg/kg), was found to produce a dose-related reduction in hoarding that was dependent upon food pellet size and that was reversed by flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Diazepam also slowed eating speed, blocked \"dodging\", a movement used to initiate hoarding, and impaired spatial navigation in a learning-set swimming pool task. The results fail to support the object value hypothesis of hoarding. Since perception of food size, motivation, motor ability and spatial abilities all probably contribute to successful food hoarding, the results provide several explanations other than, or in addition to, anxiety reduction for the drug's effects on hoarding. Nevertheless, the study provides a number of new sensitive measures of the effects of anxiolytic drugs and new insights into their behavioral effects.", 
    "44": "Sodium valproate (VPA) is a drug widely used in the treatment of epileptics often in association with benzodiazepines. Recent animal studies have shown that the addition of valproate increases diazepam levels in the cortex and the cerebellum (Hariton et al, 1985). The aim of our study was to determine the effect of VPA on the transfer of benzodiazepines through the blood-brain barrier. They were investigated using the intracarotid injection technique in rats as described by Oldendorf (1971). Our results show that the 14C-chlordiazepoxide brain extraction is significantly higher in rats on prolonged valproate treatment than in controls. With regard to plasma protein binding effects on chlordiazepoxide transport, our data indicate that a fraction of the protein-bound chlordiazepoxide could transfer from the intracapillary space to the brain tissue space because of enhanced drug dissociation from albumin in the brain microcirculation (Kd in vitro = 74.1 microM; Kd in vivo = 793.7 microM). Two distinct mechanisms can be deduced from this study: 1) chlordiazepoxide is displaced from HSA by valproate, 2) in addition, this fatty acid could increase drug permeation through the blood brain barrier (PS/F (chlordiazepoxide) = 0.60 in controls, PS/F (chlordiazepoxide) = 0.97 in treated rats). On the contrary, the washout of the benzodiazepine from the rat brain does not seem to be modified by the addition of valproate.", 
    "45": "The effect on cognitive and psychomotor performance of the benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist, flumazenil, in antagonising the central effect, of ethanol in man has been investigated. Eight healthy adult male volunteers, aged 23 to 32 years, participated in the study. Following a loading infusion, stable blood ethanol levels with a mean value of 1.6 g x l-1 were produced by a maintenance infusion. When stable blood levels of ethanol were reached, 5.0 mg flumazenil/placebo was administered intravenously, and after 15 and 75 min a test battery evaluating psychomotor and cognitive functions was applied. The test battery was sensitive to the test model, but no significant improvement in the test scores could be demonstrated following the administration of flumazenil. It is concluded that flumazenil has no influence on psychomotor functions in acute ethanol intoxication.", 
    "46": "Motor and sensory function must be assessed during surgery of scoliosis so as to avoid possible damage to the spinal cord. The intraoperative awakening by a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, was studied prospectively in 20 patients (mean age 17 years) undergoing surgery for severe scoliosis. Premedication consisted in 0.02 mg.kg-1 atropine and 0.15 mg.kg-1 midazolam. Anaesthesia was induced with a mean dose of 0.42 +/- 0.1 mg.kg-1 midazolam, 1.6 +/- 0.6 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl and 0.1 mg.kg-1 pancuronium. Maintenance was obtained with a continuous infusion of 0.22 +/- 0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 midazolam, 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen, and fentanyl (1.6 +/- 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1). Nitrous oxide and midazolam were respectively stopped 10 and 1 min before giving the antagonist (5 micrograms.kg-1 flumazenil) if required (17 out of the 20 patients). Eye opening occurred a mean 42 +/- 32 s after giving the antagonist. At this time, there was a significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure (+ 11 mmHg) and heart rate (+ 7 b.min-1). Thiopentone, 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen and 0.5% halothane were given to re-induce and maintain anaesthesia for completion of the procedure. The day following surgery, 19 patients were unable to remember the period of intraoperative awakening. One patient, although remembering the episode, did not experience any pain or any other disagreement in relation to it. Two patients were given a second dose of flumazenil at extubation so as to improve the quality of their recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "To establish inherent potential for the induction of neural tube defects the ability of selected anticonvulsant agents to interfere with cell division has been established in vitro using an antiproliferative assay in clonal cell lines and a cytotoxicity assay using primary cultures of cerebral cortex neurons at different stages of development. In order to evaluate the relative toxicities of these agents their in vitro effects were determined at 2-3 times the plasma therapeutic level. By these procedures valproate and the benzodiazepines, diazepam and clonazepam, exerted a potent antiproliferative action which could not be attributed to increased cytotoxicity. In contrast phenytoin was markedly cytotoxic but was without an antiproliferative action. This cytotoxicity was most pronounced during the periods of extensive fibre outgrowth. When compared to epidemiological and animal study data, agents which inhibited cell proliferation within twice therapeutic concentration were consistently associated with major neural tube malformations. However phenytoin, found to be positive in the cell cytotoxicity assay, is not associated with neural tube malformations but rather is primarily associated with mental retardation. Thus assessment of antiproliferative activity of anticonvulsant drugs may be one criterion for identification of teratogenic potential during neurulation.", 
    "48": "Of the numerous benzodiazepines currently available, only a few are used in anaesthetic practice. Midazolam is utilised as a premedicant, sedative, and an induction agent and produces minimal depression of ventilation or of the cardiovascular system. The anticonvulsant activity is similar to that of diazepam. In neuroanaesthesia midazolam may be an acceptable alternative to other intravenous induction agents like barbiturates or etomidate in patients with compromised intracranial compliance. Midazolam produces dose-related reductions in cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption. However, midazolam does not necessarily prevent increases in intracranial pressure during induction of anaesthesia. In the electroencephalogram (EEG) midazolam produces a reduction in alpha-activity, an increase in theta-delta-activity and low-voltage beta-activity. Midazolam like other benzodiazepines does not affect early components of auditory and somatosensory evoked responses, whereas late cortical responses may be suppressed. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, has been demonstrated to be effective in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation. In the EEG midazolam-induced changes vanish almost instantaneously. Flumazenil is also effective in restoring the amplitudes of cortical auditory and somatosensory evoked responses. However, as has been demonstrated in head-injured patients and animal experiments after incomplete cerebral ischaemia, increases in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure cannot be excluded after flumazenil administration. When utilising flumazenil for wake-up procedures in midazolam-sedated patients with pathological intracranial compliance, flumazenil has to be titrated very carefully in low doses over prolonged periods.", 
    "49": "In a randomised clinical study, two total intravenous anaesthesia techniques for microlaryngoscopic laser surgery were compared. After an induction dose of 100 mg methohexital, Group I received a maintenance infusion of 10 mg.min-1. In Group II anaesthesia was obtained by 15 mg midazolam followed by 0.1 mg.min-1 continuously and terminated by the injection of flumazenil. For analgesia 5 mg alfentanil were administered. Opiate-induced respiratory depression was antagonised by 0.08 to 0.12 mg naloxone. Prior to, during, and after surgery, adrenergic response was assessed by HPLC-analysis of blood taken from a peripheral vein. Haemodynamic responses to the operation and during the post-operative period were almost identical in both groups. In Group I, the mean recovery period of 14 min was significantly longer than in Group II (9 min), where patients received a mean dose of 0.53 mg (+/- 0.15) flumazenil. Resedation could be observed in all patients receiving flumazenil within 60 min after antagonisation, which was associated with a mean decrease in O2-saturation from 95% to 88%. There was no difference in epinephrine and norepinephrine blood levels between the two groups prior to and during anaesthesia. In all patients, arousal was associated with a significant increase in the epinephrine plasma concentration. While blood levels in Group I decreased during the post-operative period to levels prior to surgery, the concentrations in Group II remained elevated. In one patient who received no naloxone, the reversal of midazolam action induced a 16-fold increase in catecholamine levels (from 50 to 800 ng.l-1) associated with a tachycardia of 170 b.min-1 and hypertension of 160 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Midazolam, the latest benzodiazepine agonist, may be used in doses of 0.15 to 0.2 mg.kg-1 for induction of anaesthesia. It provides good correlation between plasma concentration and anaesthetic effect with an interindividual variability of only 20-25%. On this basis, dosage recommendations for midazolam in total intravenous anaesthesia techniques are possible, aiming at hypnotic plasma concentrations of at least 250 ng.ml-1. Due to its biological half-life of 150-180 min and interindividual differences in drug susceptibility, prolonged recovery periods have been observed that can safely and reliably be antagonised by flumazenil, if necessary. It is recommended that flumazenil be administered carefully by titration in increments of 0.1 mg.min-1 to avoid emergence reactions by awakening too fast (tachycardia, hypertension). Usually a mean total dose of 0.4-0.5 mg will lead to prompt awakening.", 
    "51": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of reversal of sedation with flumazenil (F), in the presence or absence of opiates, on arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). Twenty-four patients undergoing surgery and epidural anaesthesia were studied. Twelve patients (Group A) were orally premedicated with diazepam and 0.1 mg.kg-1 morphine i.m. Intraoperative sedation consisted of midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1 and pethidine 0.7 mg.kg-1 i.v. Twelve patients (Group B) were premedicated with diazepam and sedated intraoperatively with 0.1 mg.kg-1 midazolam. In the recovery room, six patients in each group were randomly allocated to receive 1 mg of flumazenil while the others were allowed to awaken spontaneously (control). Sedation (eyes open vs closed), SaO2, ETCO2, respiratory rate, blood pressure and pulse were non-invasively monitored for 90 min. Administration of flumazenil resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of patients with eyes open in both groups at 5 min, lasting 15 min in Group A and 30 min in Group B patients. An increase in SaO2 from 15-45 min after injection of flumazenil was observed only in Group B. No significant difference between groups in any other parameter was found. We concluded that reversal of benzodiazepine (BZ) sedation with flumazenil improved SaO2 in patients sedated with only BZ; in the presence of BZ and opiates, flumazenil did not affect respiratory parameters.", 
    "52": "Midazolam and flumazenil have some characteristics in common which make them suitable partners as benzodiazepine (BZD) agonist and antagonist. After intravenous (i.v.) administration, both drugs are rapidly distributed into similar distribution volumes, from which they are cleared with a comparable short elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) in the range of 1 h (flumazenil) to 3 h (midazolam). Both drugs undergo hepatic metabolisation with a relatively high hepatic extraction ratio of around 0.3 for midazolam and 0.6 for flumazenil. The metabolisation of midazolam and flumazenil may equally be affected by considerable loss of active liver cells or by temporarily reduced hepatic blood flow. In such a case, elimination of both drugs may be prolonged in the same way. Flumazenil has only an inactive metabolite. The main active alpha-hydroxy-metabolite of midazolam does not contribute much to the activity of midazolam after parenteral administration. Its potency is lower than that of midazolam and its shorter elimination half-life (0.8 h) does not prolong the activity of the parent drug. As indicated by the therapeutic index, both drugs have a very high safety margin, which is considerably higher than that of thiopentone or propofol. Only low doses of both drugs are necessary to produce initial effects. Increasing doses intensify the drug activity and a ceiling effect is observed after maximal doses of midazolam and flumazenil. The onset of effect immediately follows the diffusion of the substances into the CNS and can be observed within the first minutes following flumazenil or midazolam administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Intravenous midazolam was given to 17 patients coming to upper G.I. endoscopy. All patients had an ear oximeter and calibrated induction plethysmograph attached to record oxygen saturation and minute volume continuously. Midazolam induced significant depression of respiration. Following removal of the endoscope, a new base line was obtained before giving intravenous flumazenil in an attempt to reverse the sedative and ventilatory effects of midazolam. When 0.5 mg of flumazenil was given over 20 s, followed by 0.1 mg every minute, up to a total of 1.0 mg, all patients were apparently awake in under 2 min. Although the flumazenil had clearly reversed the sedative effects of midazolam, the ventilatory effects were largely uninfluenced. The implications are discussed.", 
    "54": "The purpose of this study was to determine if higher (36 micrograms.kg-1) doses of flumazenil (a new benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist) produced an effect on haemodynamics. Twelve patients with class III-IV angina were entered into this double-blind randomised placebo-controlled study. BZ were withheld for 2 weeks prior to surgery. Patients were placed on an ambulatory monitor 18 h prior to surgery to record changes in heart rate rhythm and ST segment changes. The patients were given secobarbital 100-200 mg and morphine 0.12 mg.kg-1 90 min prior to surgery. Flumazenil or placebo was given in divided doses every 3 min (1 mg, 1 mg, 1 mg). Complete haemodynamic profiles were obtained at baseline and 2 min following each injection of flumazenil. Flumazenil produced a minimal but statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (147 +/- 13.9 to 137 +/- 18.4 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (74 +/- 14.8 to 67 +/- 13 mmHg). There was no consistent effect on heart rate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or cardiac index. We conclude that flumazenil is safe when administered in relatively high doses to patients with ischaemic heart disease who have not received benzodiazepines.", 
    "55": "Midazolam, like other benzodiazepine agonists, reduces the autonomic and hormonal responses to emotional or surgical stress. This can be seen as a reduction in catecholamine levels after benzodiazepine treatment. The endocrine response with a reduction in cortisol values is mediated by a decrease in ACTH. The adrenal glands are immediately responsive to exogenous ACTH administration as well as to spontaneous recovery from the benzodiazepine action. Flumazenil given alone does not affect the response to emotional stress, neither does it cause any cardiovascular changes. Following benzodiazepine treatment, flumazenil given in a titrated fashion reverses the inhibitory effects of the agonists.", 
    "56": "Midazolam is useful as an intravenous supplement to local anaesthesia techniques in producing sedation, amnesia and anxiolysis, and has about five times the sedative potency of diazepam. Considerable interpatient variability exists in dose requirements, especially in elderly patients. The combined effects of local anaesthetics and midazolam may contribute to enhanced haemodynamic effects and changes in the respiratory pattern, impairing ventilation and oxygenation. Flumazenil can be titrated in incremental doses to reverse the residual sedative effects of midazolam, without intrinsic haemodynamic or respiratory effects, but may not fully antagonise the decrease in chemoreceptor sensitivity nor the changes in breathing pattern induced by midazolam. Patients treated with epidural or spinal anaesthesia supplemented with midazolam should be monitored to avoid hypoxaemia risks even after the administration of flumazenil.", 
    "57": "Midazolam's pharmacodynamic properties are used in ophthalmology in several indications: 1. to relieve anxiety and unwanted reactions during radial keratotomy in ambulatory patients; 2. to provide sedation and amnesia during cataract surgery using local anaesthesia, in combination with low doses of phenoperidine; 3. to induce general anaesthesia, combined with fentanyl and vecuronium, for intraocular surgery in the elderly; and 4. to decrease intraocular pressure. Flumazenil is not in routine use but is usually administered to antagonise the deleterious effects of midazolam on upper airway resistances and the respiration system and may be used to reverse \"paradoxical\", i.e. anxiogenic reactions to benzodiazepines in the elderly.", 
    "58": "Sedation is sometimes required for cardiovascular diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Midazolam may be proposed in these situations because of its duration of action and because of its moderate haemodynamic effects. However, the use of midazolam implies that the standards of safety required for all anaesthetic techniques have been applied. The changes in haemodynamic data induced by the administration of midazolam must be taken into account in interpretation of the catheterisation report. At the end of investigation, flumazenil can be administered safely to reverse residual sedative effects of midazolam but its use does not exempt from normal monitoring during the recovery period.", 
    "59": "The effects of midazolam (3-10 mg i.m.) and their reversal by flumazenil were studied in transurethral endoscopic procedures performed using topical analgesia. In one randomised study, patients (n = 84) received either no medication or flumazenil (0.5 mg i.v.) on completion of endoscopy. Recovery was assessed subjectively. Within 15 min, 83% of those receiving flumazenil were considered ready for discharge compared with only 24% of the control group (P less than 0.001). In a second randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 44 patients, post-operative recovery was assessed using five objective psychomotor tests. Whereas the placebo group took up to 2 h to recover, those receiving flumazenil recovered fully or returned to near control values within 15 min. Sedoanalgesia--a technique combining adequate local anaesthesia with sedation (using midazolam)--has wide application in urology, and the introduction of flumazenil has major implications for the practice of day-case surgery.",

Forty patients in each of two centres were given a standard dose of either flumazenil (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) after gastroscopy under midazolam sedation. Assessments were made of degree of sedation, psychomotor ability and amnesia up to 24 h after endoscopy. In patients treated with flumazenil, sedation was effectively reversed within 5 min in 77.5% of cases compared to 27.5% of patients treated with placebo. The difference was both clinically and statistically significant at 5 and 30 min but not at 60 min after reversal. There was no evidence of resedation 18 to 24 h later. Times to complete Trieger dot-joining tests were significantly faster in the flumazenil group at 5, 30 and 60 min. Amnesia for the procedure was retained but did not occur for events after administration of flumazenil. The only adverse event was severe pain in the arm of one patient during the injection of flumazenil. Flumazenil rapidly and safely reverses midazolam-induced sedation while retaining amnesia for gastroscopy.", 
    "61": "Benzodiazepines, used correctly, provide a relatively safe means of providing sedation in a variety of clinical situations and midazolam, which is shorter acting than other benzodiazepines (BZ), is the drug of choice in ambulatory patients. Flumazenil is a highly effective specific competitive BZ antagonist which provides a safe means of rapidly attenuating or terminating BZ sedation. Its mean half-life is 54 min, and in this contact the optimal dosage is 0.2 to 0.5 mg. Although it reverses sedation and amnesia, there is still a question about whether its efficacy in reversing the respiratory depressant effects of benzodiazepines is adequate. This remains an area of critical debate, as does resedation and also its administration to chronic benzodiazepine users. The use of flumazenil to reverse midazolam-induced sedation introduces, for the first time, the possibility of terminating sedation at a predetermined time. Were it to be adopted routinely, it has major implications for the improvement of patient management affecting all aspects of post-operative care.", 
    "62": "In vivo (delorazepam clearance) and in vitro (monooxygenase activity markers) alterations in drug metabolism and the extent of enzyme induction of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 system were evaluated after oral administration of delorazepam (2.5, 25 and 150 mg/kg) for two weeks to male Sprague-Dawley rats. This benzodiazepine had no significant effect on drug metabolizing enzymes, except for slight enhancement of in vitro aniline p-hydroxylase activity which occurred at doses approximately 100 times those used clinically (0.5-2 mg). Under the likely conditions of exposure to delorazepam in human therapy therefore, such alteration in liver enzymes would be unlikely to have clinical relevance.", 
    "63": "Several anxiolytic/anxiogenic treatments were evaluated on male rat sexual behavior. The anxiolytic drug diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) inhibited copulatory behavior as indicated by an increase in the number of mounts preceding ejaculation, prolongation of the ejaculation latency and the postejaculatory interval. These changes were not accompanied by alterations in motor coordination as tested on a treadmill apparatus. A lower dose of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) did not affect the sexual behavior. The anxiogenic drug Zk 39106 (2 and 4 mg/kg) facilitated the copulatory behavior by reducing the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation. A higher dose of Zk 39106 (8 mg/kg) inhibited sexual behavior. The selective benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (5 and 10 mg/kg), did not modify male sexual behavior, but effectively antagonized the effects of Zk 39106 and diazepam. The administration of Zk 39106 (2 mg/kg) reversed the inhibitory action of diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) on copulation; however, diazepam did not prevent the facilitory effect of Zk 39106. The data are discussed in terms of the possible relationship existing between anxiety and masculine sexual behavior.", 
    "64": "We evaluated the clinical usefulness of flumazenil (formerly Ro15-1788), a benzodiazepine antagonist, in combination with midazolam in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thirty outpatients were randomized into two groups: those receiving flumazenil and those receiving placebo after endoscopy. For sedation, only midazolam was used. Performances pre-sedation and post-sedation (at 30 and 60 min) were analyzed using the Trieger test, Number Connection test, and Digit Symbol test. Patients receiving flumazenil were fully alert and able to ambulate 5 min after injection with this medication. Performances at 30 min in the Trieger, Number Connection, and Digit Symbol tests were significantly better in the group receiving flumazenil, p less than 0.005, p less than 0.025, and p less than 0.01, respectively. No phlebitis, nausea, vomiting, or anxiety were noted. No resedation events were documented. We conclude that flumazenil can dramatically shorten the recovery period following sedation with midazolam in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and its use is not associated with major side effects.", 
    "65": "The new benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil represents another approach to the ever-present problem of recurring respiratory depression after anesthesia with flunitrazepam and fentanyl. Objective and subjective side effects of flumazenil were studied in comparison with the opiate antagonists naloxone and nalbuphine. METHODS. One hundred fifty surgical patients, ASA I or II, aged 18-65 years were studied. After premedication with atropine 0.5 mg and flunitrazepam 0.5 mg anesthesia was induced with flunitrazepam 0.5 mg, fentanyl 0.1 mg and etomidate 10 mg and maintained with N2O/O2 2:1 and additional increments of 0.1 mg fentanyl as required. Relaxation for intubation and surgery was obtained with non depolarizing muscle relaxants. After the operation the patients were extubated and then flumazenil 0.4 mg, naloxone 0.05 mg, or nalbuphine 20 mg was given i.v. (randomized and double-blind). In 15 patients blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. In all patients postoperative pain was assessed by the time interval between administration of the antagonist and need for the first analgesic medication. On the 1st postoperative day recall of postoperative events and of pictures shown 5, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after administration of the antagonist was tested. The patients were interviewed a second time for side effects on day 3-6 after the operation. RESULTS. The three antagonists produced no significant effects on arterial pressure and heart rate. There were no differences between the antagonists in the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting or postoperative pain. After flumazenil, a significant transient increase in vigilance and better recall of postoperative events was noted within 5 and 30 min after administration of the drug. CONCLUSION. On the basis of the objective clinical findings, there is no reason to prefer either benzodiazepine or opiate antagonists after flunitrazepam and fentanyl. However, postoperative amnesia can be reduced by flumazenil if this is desirable.", 
    "66": "The excretion of diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam in breast milk was studied during withdrawal of a 22-year-old patient from combined high dose diazepam and oxazepam therapy. Concentrations of these benzodiazepines in plasma from both the woman and her nursing infant (1 year old) were also documented. Diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam were found in the maternal plasma and milk with mean milk: plasma ratios of 0.2, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.10 respectively. It was calculated on a mg kg-1 basis that the infant received some 4.7% of the maternal dose. Diazepam could not be detected in the infant's plasma, but low levels of N-desmethyldiazepam (20 and 21 micrograms l-1), temazepam (7 micrograms l-1) and oxazepam (7.5 and 9.6 micrograms l-1) were present. The infant showed no overt physical or mental symptoms of benzodiazepine intoxication.", 
    "67": "The effects of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, on the rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) formation (Vf), resistance to reabsorption of CSF (Ra) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) was determined in 12 dogs anesthetized with halothane (0.4%, end-expired) and nitrous oxide (66%, inspired) in oxygen. In six dogs the responses to flumazenil were measured during administration of midazolam (1.6 mg/kg followed by 1.25 mg.kg-1.h-1, intravenously) given along with inhalational anesthesia, whereas in the other six dogs the responses to flumazenil were measured during inhalational anesthesia without midazolam. Vf and Ra were determined using ventriculocisternal perfusion, and EEG activity was evaluated using aperiodic analysis. Flumazenil, 0.0025 and 0.16 mg/kg, was administered both when CSF pressure was normal and when CSF pressure was increased to 36-38 cmH2O by continuous infusion of mock CSF. Flumazenil produced no statistically significant change in Vf. Flumazenil did produce inconsistent and relatively small changes in Ra. Quantitative aperiodic analysis indicated changes in EEG activity only when the larger dose of flumazenil was given to dogs receiving midazolam. At normal CSF pressure the changes were consistent and were comprised of decreases in theta, alpha, and total hemispheric power. At elevated CSF pressure the changes were less consistent. It is concluded that smaller doses of flumazenil (which cause no EEG changes with the present method of analysis) and larger doses of flumazenil (which reverse midazolam-induced increase of theta and alpha activity) produce no change of Vf and no consistent change of Ra. Although flumazenil given in the presence of midazolam may increase Ra, thereby increasing CSF pressure and impairing contraction of CSF volume, this effect is not likely to be clinically important.", 
    "68": "A phase 1 double blind crossover comparison of a new benzodiazepine antagonist (Ro 15-3505) with Ro 15-1788 and placebo, in the reversal of sedative and psychophysiological effects of single IV doses of flunitrazepam (2 mg), was carried out in 12 normal volunteers. The antagonists were equally effective, leading to full reversal of all effects with a potency ratio of approximately 2.5 mg Ro 15-1788 for 1 mg Ro 15-3505. Inverse agonism, in the form of unpleasant feelings and symptoms, was reported by all subjects following Ro 15-3505 but none after Ro 15-1788. Adaptational phenomena such as acute tolerance and rebound of sedative effects of flunitrazepam were also detected and their potential implications are discussed.", 
    "69": "The effect of omeprazole treatment on diazepam plasma levels was studied in four slow and six rapid metabolizers of omeprazole. Single intravenous doses of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) were administered after 1 week of oral treatment with omeprazole (20 mg) and placebo. This was a double-blind crossover study with randomized placebo and omeprazole treatments. Blood was collected up to 120 hours after diazepam dosing (still during one-daily omeprazole and placebo administration) for measurement of diazepam and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam. The slow metabolizers of omeprazole also metabolized diazepam slowly, exhibiting only half the diazepam plasma clearance of the others. The mean clearance of diazepam was decreased 26% after omeprazole in the rapid metabolizers, whereas the slow group showed no apparent interaction. The mean plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam showed a more rapid formation in the rapid compared with the slow metabolizers, which is a logical consequence of the rate of diazepam metabolism.", 
    "70": "Recently it was suggested that hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is mediated by an increased GABA-ergic tone. The logical consequence of such a hypothesis is the use of antagonists of the GABA -benzodiazepine receptor for treatment of HE. The experience with these drugs in human HE is limited. In order to get an estimate of the efficacy of this type of drug in humans 20 consecutive episodes of HE in 17 patients with acute or chronic liver failure were treated with flumazenil. All patients entered into the study were encephalopathic for up to 120 hours and failed to respond to conventional therapy. After an observation period of 8 hours, 15 mg of flumazenil were infused intravenously over 3 hours. Before and after treatment patients were examined neurologically and the Glasgow coma scale was calculated. In addition, somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded. In 5 out of 11 episodes in 10 patients with fulminant hepatic failure and in 7 out of 9 episodes in 7 patients with cirrhosis an unequivocal amelioration of HE was observed. The response to treatment occurred very rapidly. After stopping treatment in 8 out of these 12 episodes HE worsened again after 2 to 4 hours. The favourable clinical response was also documented by improvement of somatosensory evoked potentials. In 5 of the 8 episodes not reacting to flumazenil patients had signs of increased intracranial pressure. These findings indicate that flumazenil may be valuable in treatment of acute HE occurring in fulminant hepatic failure or in decompensated cirrhosis.", 
    "71": "1. Dose-equivalence studies of zopiclone and triazolam were carried out. 2. Zopiclone (6.25, 8.75 and 11.25 mg), triazolam (0.1875, 0.375 and 0.5 mg) and placebo were given in the morning to 14 healthy male volunteers aged 20-25 years under double-blind conditions according to an incomplete block design. Each patient received three of the seven possible treatments at intervals of at least 1 week. Subjects were evaluated using physiological measures, rating scales and memory tasks before and 1.5 and 4.5 h after drug administration. 3. The sedative and amnestic effects of zopiclone were qualitatively similar to those of triazolam, with the highest dose of each having the greatest effect. 4. On the basis of the digit symbol substitution test, 10 mg of zopiclone is equivalent to 0.5 mg of triazolam. Methodological problems of the experimental design of dose-equivalence studies are discussed.",

The basic features of the analytical methodologies described (sensitivity, selectivity, precision and rapidity) are also discussed and critically compared.", 
    "73": "Clinically used calcium antagonists are derivatives of either verapamil (verapamil), dihydropyridines (e.g. felodipine and nifedipine), or benzothiazepines (diltiazem). The principal side effects are mostly predictable, dose-dependent, and related to their main actions: vasodilatation, negative inotropic effects and antiarrhythmic effects. All calcium antagonists have demonstrated a pronounced hypotensive effect. Conduction disturbances and bradycardia are seen more often after verapamil and diltiazem, while tachycardia, headache, ankle oedema; and flush are more frequent after felodipine and nifedipine. Another side effect is constipation, which is frequent after verapamil. Important interactions have been reported with, for instance, digoxin and beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Calcium antagonists may have favourable effects on serum lipids, and there is no indication of consistent changes in basal glucose metabolism. Uric acid is unchanged or reduced. Regarding the effects on the quality of life exerted by the different calcium antagonists, very little is known since such studies have not been performed so far.", 
    "74": "Experiments were performed in the adult normotensive rats of Wistar strain in the genetically hypertensive rats of Koltsky type. Diazepam at the dose of 1 mg/kg was applied for five days. The last two days of diazepam treatment the behavior of the animals was traced in holeboard and in the elevated plus-maze. In the control animals the genetically hypertensive rats of both sexes show elevated locomotor-exploratory activity in holeboard in both sessions, genetically hypertensive females show highest degree of directed exploration in holeboard when compared with the other groups of rats; in the elevated plus-maze the normotensive rats of both sexes show lower aversion towards open space and height in elevated plus-maze relative to genetically hypertensive rats. Diazepam only in the genetically hypertensive females increases in the second session locomotor-exploratory activity and reduced the inter-session habituation of the mentioned activity. Directed exploratory activity in holeboard was by diazepam treatment elevated predominantly in the genetically hypertensive rats. In the genetically hypertensive females diazepam caused inter-session sensitization in directed exploration. Considering the number of entries in centre and in open arms of the elevated plus-maze, diazepam in both strains irrespective of sex and session caused increase. Taking into account time spent in centre and in open arms of the elevated plus-maze, the strain dependent effect of diazepam is apparent, i.e., statistical significance of its \"anxiolytic\" effect was attained only in the genetically hypertensive rats.", 
    "75": "A study of the prediction of cancer and coronary heart disease on the basis of coffee consumption and personality shows that in cancer-prone probands (diagnosed on the basis of a personality inventory) coffee consumption was related to low incidence of cancer and high incidence of coronary heart disease, while diazepam showed the opposite trend. In coronary heart disease-prone probands coffee drinking was also linked with low incidence of cancer and high incidence of coronary heart disease, with diazepam again showing the opposite trend. In a personality type not prone to either disease, neither coffee consumption nor diazepam was linked with death from cancer or coronary heart disease. It is suggested that personality interacts in a predictable way with coffee and diazepam to determine in part the likelihood of death from cancer or coronary heart disease. Imipramine acts in a fashion similar to coffee, and opposite to diazepam.", 
    "76": "The effect of a single dose (3 mg) of alprazolam on plasma cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin, norepinephrine (NE) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) was studied in 10 healthy males. Alprazolam and placebo were administered orally in a crossover design and blood was sampled for 24 h. In comparison to placebo, alprazolam significantly reduced plasma cortisol levels and raised plasma GH levels. Prolactin levels were elevated by 100% from 2 to 8 h after alprazolam administration. The robust increase in prolactin levels is less consistent with previously reported data on traditional benzodiazepines. Plasma NE levels following alprazolam were lower than following placebo administration only at one time point, and MHPG concentrations were not affected. The lack of change in NE and MHPG levels suggests that the acute effect of alprazolam in normal subjects is not mediated via the central noradrenergic system.", 
    "77": "Agonists acting at subtypes of glutamate receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate and quisqualate, induce convulsions in rodents. Clonic seizures induced in mice by intracerebral administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate or quisqualate were used to study the anti- and proconvulsant potential of antiepileptic drugs and beta-carbolines. Systemic administration showed that the benzodiazepines clonazepam and midazolam blocked convulsions induced by kainate and had no effect on seizures triggered by N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate. In contrast, diazepam blocked convulsions induced by either excitatory amino acid, as did valproate. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist beta-carboline ZK 93423 blocked convulsions induced by kainate but had no effect on seizures induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate or quisqualate. The antagonist beta-carboline ZK 93426 did not affect convulsions induced by excitatory amino acids, while the inverse agonists FG 7142 and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate increased the sensitivity of mice to kainate. Phenobarbital and 2-chloroadenosine protected mice against seizures induced by quisqualate and kainate, while baclofen was active against convulsions produced by kainate. MK-801 selectively blocked convulsions induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate, and enhanced the susceptibility of mice to seizures triggered by kainate and quisqualate. Ethosuximide increased the susceptibility of mice to N-methyl-D-aspartate and had little or no effect on other types of seizures. Diphenylhydantoin enhanced the convulsant potential of quisqualate. Trimethadione and carbamazepine did not affect convulsions induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate or quisqualate. Intracerebral administration of midazolam protected mice against seizures induced by kainate. Ethosuximide increased the susceptibility of mice to N-methyl-D-aspartate, while diphenylhydantoin to quisqualate convulsions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "79": "Five benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam and chlordiazepoxide) were compared with respect to their capacity to affect microsomal aniline hydroxylase, aminopyrine N-demethylase and 4-nitroanisole O-demethylase of rats exposed to the high ambient temperature of 28 degrees C or 35 degrees C. We have stated that the highest effect on the microsomal enzyme activities was observed after chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam or nitrazepam treatments. These results indicate that the presence of nitro group at position 7 or N-oxide at position 4 of benzodiazepine is important for the ability of benzodiazepines to affect the hepatic microsomal enzymes. High environmental temperature modifies the effect of benzodiazepines on tested microsomal enzymes.", 
    "80": "Among the benzodiazepines tested (diazepam, oxazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam and chlordiazepoxide ) chlordiazepoxide is the most potent inducer of cytochrome P-450, diazepam is a poor inducer, whereas clonazepam and nitrazepam do not possess a capacity to induce of cytochrome P-450. On the other hand, microsomal cytochrome b5 is induced by diazepam only. The extent of induction of cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5 depends on the environmental temperature. Chlordiazepoxide is the most potent inducer of cytochrome P-450 in rats exposed to an ambient temperature of 28 degrees C, whereas diazepam have the highest induction ability in rats exposed to 35 degrees C. On the other hand, nitrazepam increased the content of cytochrome b5 in rats exposed to temperature of 35 degrees C only; diazepam was the most potent inducer of cytochrome b5 in rats exposed to temperature of 21 degrees C. These results indicate that high ambient temperature is a factor modifying the ability of benzodiazepines to induce of microsomal cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5.", 
    "81": "The pharmacokinetic behaviour of flunitrazepam and its main active metabolite, N-desmethyl flunitrazepam, was investigated in 12 patients with liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatitis) compared to 6 healthy volunteers. A gas-liquid chromatographic method allowing for simultaneous determination of flunitrazepam and N-desmethyl flunitrazepam in plasma samples was developed. The accuracy and the precision near the quantification limit of ca. 1 ng/ml were better than 5%. Plasma levels of flunitrazepam were not significantly altered by hepatic failure, whereas plasma levels of N-desmethyl flunitrazepam were lower in patients than in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between healthy subjects and liver disease patients: the oral clearance was 3.5 +/- 0.8, 3.5 +/- 1.9 and 4.0 +/- 1.2 ml/min/kg, respectively in healthy subjects, patients with hepatitis and patients with cirrhosis. The apparent elimination half-life was 22 +/- 5 h in healthy subjects, 25 +/- 10 h in patients with hepatitis and 20 +/- 6 h in patients with cirrhosis. However, the expected increase of the drug free fraction during liver disease could decrease the therapeutic and toxic ranges of flunitrazepam in these patients.",

The results indicated that a film composed of a 1:0.5 drug-chitosan mixture might be an effective dosage form that is equivalent to the commercial tablet dosage forms.

    "83": "1. In a double-blind study of the effects of diazepam and naltrexone on retroactive memory interference, 88 healthy human volunteers were asked to study a text on the 1954 World Soccer Cup and were submitted to a written questionnaire on the material 48 h later. Three hours after reading the text, 58 of the subjects were exposed to a non-factual, derogatory comment on the World Cup. 2. All subjects were given either placebo or naltrexone (50 mg) before reading the text, and either placebo or diazepam (5 mg), per os, 2 h after reading the text (1 h prior to the comment). Subjects were assigned to the different treatment groups by a double-blind design. 3. Exposure to the derogatory comment caused retroactive memory interference with the retention of material from the text. Diazepam blocked the retroactive interference and had no effect of its own on retention of the text. Pretreatment with naltrexone did not influence retention, retrograde interference, or the effect of diazepam on these variables. 4. The results obtained here extend to healthy adult humans observations made on rats and mice in which diazepam blocked retroactive memory interference.", 
    "84": "Photodiode array liquid chromatography detectors are claimed to have the ability of evaluating the homogeneity of chromatographic peaks and this could provide a very powerful tool in support of method development. However, in pharmaceutical analysis, for this to be of practical value it must be capable of detecting inhomogeneities at low levels. In this paper, a test has been devised to challenge the sensitivity of instruments to this application. The test makes use of mixtures of the similar benzodiazepines temazepam and lormetazepam in a chromatographic system which does not separate them. One instrument has demonstrated the ability to detect levels of just 0.5% w/w of one benzodiazepine in the other. Statistical F-tests and t-tests have been used to demonstrate that non-homogeneities have been detected with a high level of confidence. It is concluded that photodiode array detectors have the potential to evaluate the homogeneity of chromatographic peaks with a high degree of sensitivity. However, most instruments do not realize this potential because their software does not make proper use of all the data available.", 
    "85": "The efficacy of zolpidem 20 mg was compared to that of flunitrazepam 2 mg. Forty-two insomniac female in-patients between 30 and 65 years of age were included in a double blind, parallel group trial and were randomly allocated to the two treatments. Study duration was 9 days with 2 days of placebo run-in, 5 days of active medication and 2 days of placebo withdrawal. Sleep latency, sleep duration, number of awakenings and time spent asleep during the night were given an ordinal score; condition in the morning was evaluated by Visual Analogue Scales and the psychomotor performance was evaluated by the tests: night-day for anterograde amnesia, digit span for verbal recall and Gr\u00fcnberger's fine motor function test. There was no significant difference between zolpidem and flunitrazepam for any of the variables; the drugs were significantly better than placebo baseline for all the sleep efficacy variables. The results of this study indicate that zolpidem is as effective as flunitrazepam in inducing and maintaining sleep but it does not induce a sense of weakness in the morning and does not impair memory.", 
    "86": "In this paper the effects of serenics (eltoprazine and fluprazine) are described in several animal models for offensive agonistic, defensive agonistic and predatory behaviour. They are compared with the effects of a number of other putative anti-aggressive compounds or drugs used clinically in order to ameliorate aggressive behaviour of psychiatric patients. In isolation-induced offensive aggression in mice, eltoprazine has a marked and potent anti-aggressive activity, although numerous other psychoactive drugs also exert anti-aggressive effects. The behavioural specificity of this anti-aggressive profile was investigated using an ethologically derived animal model, social interaction in male mice. In this model, eltoprazine has a very specific anti-aggressive (serenic) profile, inhibiting aggression while social interaction and exploration are not decreased but even enhanced; inactivity, a measure for sedation, is not affected. Such a profile contrasts sharply with that of neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, haloperidol), psychostimulants (d-amphetamine) or benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide), which exert severe sedation (neuroleptics) or even aggression-enhancing effects (BDZ). After subchronic treatment no tolerance for the anti-aggressive effects of eltoprazine occurred. The specific anti-aggressive effects of eltoprazine were also found in rat models of offensive agonistic behaviour. In one such model - resident-intruder aggression - eltoprazine reduced offensive behaviour specifically, leaving social interactions and exploration intact, and did not induce sedation or other unwanted side-effects. The neuroleptic haloperidol was very sedative in this model, as was the 5-HT1A-agonist buspirone. Benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide) have a biphasic effect in this paradigm, enhancing offence at low doses and decreasing it at higher doses, due to muscle relaxation. In another offensive model, colony-aggression, in which a dominant and subordinate male in a colony are confronted with a male intruder, eltoprazine reduced offensive behaviour of both the dominant and the subordinate against the intruder. In contrast, chlordiazepoxide enhanced aggression, at least at lower doses, whereas alcohol had, up to very high doses, no effect on the offensive behaviour. In a brain-stimulation induced offensive model--hypothalamically-induced aggression in rats--eltoprazine specifically reduces offence. Locomotion, a measure for sedation, was either unaffected or even somewhat enhanced, indicating the absence of any sedatory activity of this serenic compound. In contrast, haloperidol heavily sedated animals, making them incapable of aggression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "87": "The increased heart rate is a frequent, seldom clinically significant side-effect of antidepressants. There are different opinions about the Maprotiline influence on the heart rate, either about its very existence or the pathophysiological mechanism of its side-effect. The aim of this study was to test the Maprotiline influence on the heart rate of depressed patients and to compare the results with the results of other studies. The study was carried out in a group of 21 patients with a depressive involutional syndrome treated by fixed daily doses of 150 mg of Maprotiline. The heart rate was estimated in a small sample of examinees using the method of paired observations, as a part of the orthostatic cardiovascular tolerance testing by Schellong's method; this was done before the therapy and twice a week during four week of the application of Maprotiline. The increase in the heart rate in the basal reclining position was noticed in 20 patients. The average value was 16 beats per minute. The increase of the heart rate was not noticed immediately after the application of the first doses but after the latency of 8 days on average. While increasing in the basal reclining position, the orthostatic deviation of the heart rate did not significantly change during the therapy. At the end of the study the orthostatic deviation even showed a negative sign. The reclining of the patients at the end of Schellong's test discovered a frequent occurrence of the prolonged blood pressure return from higher to normal values. The results obtained confirm the thesis that the increased heart rate in the therapy with Maprotiline is due to its noradrenergic activity, in other words, to its ability to block the \"reuptake\" of noradrenalin in the synaptic cleft. The delay of the heart rate increase in the basal reclining position, a more frequent prolonged blood pressure return in the further phase of the study, and the therapeutic response delay in the treatment of depression are explained by the authors by the same mechanism: by the most probable existence of the pathological changes in the synapses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "88": "The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve was quantified in 15 patients subjected to hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass under opiate-benzodiazepine anesthesia using the alpha-stat approach to control blood acid-base status. The P50 was calculated from a single measurement of oxygen tension and hemoglobin saturation in blood obtained from the pulmonary artery or the venous line from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. In addition, the P50 was directly determined at the registered patient temperature. The P50 decreased from 3.87(+/- 0.15) kPa (mean, SEM) before anesthesia to 1.55(+/- 0.16) kPa during hypothermic (25.43 +/- 1.99 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.001). On rewarming, the P50 increased to 4.89 +/- 0.27 kPa (at 36.14 +/- 0.14 degrees C, p less than 0.001 compared to the preinduction and hypothermic values). Eight hours after cardiopulmonary bypass the P50 returned to the preinduction value (3.72 +/- 0.22 kPa). The relationship between temperature and P50 is described by the regression equation: P50 = 0.22(+/- 0.02).Temperature--3.78(+/- 0.62). The correlation was 0.78 (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that (1) the leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve during hypothermia may be detrimental to oxygen delivery and (2) the oxygen saturation of the venous blood should not be used indiscriminately to evaluate cellular oxygen status."
