The rate-determining step is usually the reaction of the substrate with a radical chain initiator, which is often an unknown impurity. The reactivity and selectivity of autoxidation can be controlled better by using a radical chain initiator, such as AIBN, than by changing the temperature or the oxygen pressure. In this paper the products profiles of four pharmaceutical substances in a simple oxidation test with AIBN are compared with the results of long term natural stability tests or with already established stabilities.", 
    "1": "Previous research has found that drugs with affinity for omega (benzodiazepine) sites differ in their abilities to produce tolerance and dependence. The present study therefore investigated the effects of ligands of omega (BZ) sites in rats that had been rendered tolerant to a benzodiazepine. Two experiments were carried out in separate groups of rats. Behavioral changes induced by chronic infusion of triazolam (3 mg/kg/day, SC, for 14 days) via osmotic pumps were studied in animals trained on a fixed ratio 10 schedule of food presentation. Control animals were implanted with pumps containing the vehicle. Test drugs were administered IP using cumulative dosing. In one experiment triazolam decreased response rates on days 1, 2 and 3 after implantation of the pumps and tolerance developed to this depressant effect. In the other experiment, vehicle and triazolam treated rats differed in their responding during chronic infusion but differences were not statistically significant on any particular day. Flumazenil (3.0-30 mg/kg) greatly decreased rates of responding on day 11 in triazolam treated rats. This effect may represent a precipitated withdrawal syndrome. However, no withdrawal effects on operant performance were observed upon pump removal. Chronic infusion of triazolam did not affect the sensitivity of rats to alpidem on day 11 (10-100 mg/kg) whereas it abolished the stimulant effect of bretazenil (0.1-1.0 mg/kg). Chronic triazolam treatment produced tolerance to the depressant effects of triazolam (1.0-3.0 mg/kg), lorazepam (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) and zopiclone (10 mg/kg) but no tolerance to those of CL 218,872 (3.0-30 mg/kg) and zolpidem (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) when tested 3-14 days after pump removal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Anxiolytic benzodiazepines have been shown to impair place learning in the Morris water maze. However, a clear-cut demonstration of a direct and specific effect on mnemonic processes has not yet been offered. In the present study, the effects of diazepam on place navigation in the Morris water maze were studied in rats. Three conditions were examined: learning, reversal learning and learning after familiarisation of animals with the maze. In view of the anxiolytic and sedative properties of diazepam, appropriate doses of the drug, i.e. those that produced an anxiolytic effect but no major motor impairment, were initially selected in the water-lick conflict and rotarod tests, respectively. Doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg PO increased punished drinking in the water-lick conflict test without significantly decreasing rotarod performance. These doses were then used to assess the effects of diazepam on spatial behaviour. Diazepam, at both doses, impaired place learning in behaviourally naive rats. Such an effect appeared to be transient: diazepam-treated rats eventually reached control performance. Moreover, analysis of the probe trial at the end of training revealed adoption of a spatial strategy to locate the submerged platform. Neither reversal learning nor learning after familiarisation was affected. These results do not replicate previous findings in the Morris water maze and provide some evidence that the diazepam-induced place learning deficit may be primarily anxiolytic in nature.", 
    "3": "Rats tested for sensitivity/reactivity to formalin-induced pain in either an aversively conditioned or a novel environment displayed immediate but transient hypoalgesic responses that were insensitive to either a benzodiazepine (midazolam) or an opioid antagonist (naloxone). Exposure to the aversively conditioned, but not to the novel environment also provoked a more enduring hypoalgesic response that was abolished by either midazolam or naloxone. The results were taken to mean that fear is sufficient but not necessary for the production of hypoalgesic responses to environmental stimuli.", 
    "4": "Chronic administration of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP) produced tolerance to its motor-impairing effects but little or no tolerance to its hypothermic effects or to its amnesic effects in the radial arm maze. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated for 14 days with CDP (25 mg/kg, b.i.d., IP) or saline, and chronic treatment was maintained throughout the experiments. Tolerance was evaluated by constructing dose-response curves to CDP following chronic administration of either CDP or saline. Tolerance developed to only certain behavioral effects of CDP. Tolerance developed to the motor-impairing effects of CDP as assessed in three different procedures: rotarod, spontaneous locomotor activity, and acquisition of the step-through inhibitory avoidance response. In contrast, tolerance did not develop to the hypothermic effects of CDP. Tolerance to the amnesic effects of CDP was contingent upon the behavioral procedure. For example, tolerance developed to reductions of retention latency in the step-through inhibitory avoidance response, but not to impairment of the acquisition of radial arm maze performance. These results are consistent with the effects of chronic BZ administration in humans and demonstrate a parallel regulation of drug effects, potentially mediated by regional differences in BZ receptor subtype regulation or composition.", 
    "5": "It has been suggested that withdrawal from several subclasses of central nervous system (CNS) depressants involves common underlying mechanisms. For example, mice genetically selected for severe ethanol withdrawal convulsions (Withdrawal Seizure Prone or WSP) have also been found to express severe withdrawal following treatment with barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Corticosteroids appear to modulate severity of withdrawal from CNS depressants. Therefore, it was hypothesized that corticosterone would enhance withdrawal convulsions following acute ethanol, pentobarbital, and diazepam in WSP mice. Corticosterone (20 mg/kg) administered following each of these drugs significantly increased severity of handling-induced convulsions during withdrawal. Corticosterone did not affect pre-withdrawal convulsion scores or handling-induced convulsions of drug-naive mice. These results suggest that withdrawal convulsions following acute ethanol, pentobarbital, and diazepam are sensitive to modulation by corticosterone and they support the hypothesis that stress may increase drug withdrawal severity.", 
    "6": "\"Divided attention\" is a psychological construct that hinges on assumptions about a fixed finite capacity of subjects to simultaneously process multiple sets of information. A model of a crossmodal divided attention task was developed in rats. Initially, rats were trained consecutively in operant auditory and visual conditional discrimination tasks. The final task consisted of two successive blocks of 20 trials per modality (modality certainty), followed by 60 trials comprising a semi-randomized sequence of stimuli of both modalities (auditory or visual) and qualities (flashing/pulsing or constantly turned on; modality uncertainty). In comparison to unimodal blocks of trials, performance in the mixed condition was assumed to reflect the demands on the parallel processing of two sets of stimulus-response rules. While response accuracy remained unchanged, response latencies were generally longer in the bimodal condition. Administration of scopolamine (0.03, 0.06, 0.1 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (1, 3, 5, 8 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased response latencies. The scopolamine-induced increase in response latencies was greater in the mixed condition. Cost-benefit analyses demonstrated that the absolute divided attention costs (in ms) were generally higher for visual than for auditory stimuli. Both drugs produced qualitatively similar effects; however, scopolamine was more potent in increasing the absolute divided attention costs than chlordiazepoxide. These data are discussed in terms of the validity of this animal paradigm, and of hypotheses about the effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists and muscarinic antagonists on brain information processing capacity.", 
    "7": "In earlier research, we have hypothesized that exposure to nitrous oxide (N2O) produces an anxiolytic effect that is mediated by benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. The present research was conducted to characterize pharmacologically the behavioral effects of N2O in comparison with a BZ standard, chlordiazepoxide (CP), in the mouse elevated plus maze. Exposure to increasing levels of N2O produced a concentration-related increase in the percent of total entries into and the percent of total time spent on the open arms, a pattern of response similar to that induced by CP. These effects on N2O and CP were both antagonized by pretreatment with the BZ receptor blocker flumazenil (FLU). In another experiment, mice made tolerant to CP also exhibited a cross-tolerance to N2O. These results support the hypothesis that the anxiolytic effect of N2O is mediated by BZ receptors.", 
    "8": "Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a 41 amino acid peptide implicated in the expression of stress- and fear-enhanced behaviors. CRF potentiates the amplitude of the startle reflex, and this effect is reversed by benzodiazepines (BDZ), suggesting that the startle-enhancing effects of CRF are modulated by changes in the GABA/BDZ receptor complex. In the present study, CRF-potentiated startle is inhibited by alphaxalone, a pregnane steroid anesthetic that is thought to act via the GABA/BDZ receptor complex. Alphaxalone (ALX) does not reduce CRF-potentiated startle by producing a generalized reduction in reactivity, since blockade of CRF-stimulated startle was not accompanied by an ALX-induced reduction in baseline startle amplitude and ALX does not reduce strychnine-potentiated startle. The effects of alphaxalone on CRF-potentiated startle may not be generalized to all CRF-stimulated behaviours, since alphaxalone failed to disrupt CRF-stimulated locomotor activity. CRF-potentiated startle is a useful assay for studying the effects of novel anxiolytic agents, and alphaxalone appears to be a steroid anesthetic with anxiolytic properties in this assay.", 
    "9": "Previous studies have shown selective and nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) to be effective in the treatment of social phobia. In this study we investigated the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in social phobia. Thirty patients with social phobia (DSM-IIIR) were treated with the SS-RI fluvoxamine (150 mg daily) using a 12-week double-blind placebo controlled design. A substantial improvement was observed in seven (46%) patients on fluvoxamine and in one (7%) on placebo. Statistically significant effects were seen on measures of social anxiety and general (or anticipatory) anxiety in patients treated with fluvoxamine compared with placebo. The level of phobic avoidance decreased also but the difference at endpoint between fluvoxamine and placebo failed to reach statistical significance. It is concluded that treatment with the SSRI fluvoxamine has beneficial effects in patients suffering from social phobia, suggesting that serotonergic mechanisms might be implicated in social anxiety.", 
    "10": "Midazolam is a short-acting water soluble benzodiazepine that has been used with an increasing frequency in the last years. Although there are reports on its use in status epilepticus, there is none in the neonatal period. A pre-term (35 w) AGA newborn infant with a severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy secondary to grade III hyaline membrane disease developed status epilepticus in the first 6 hours of life and was successfully treated with midazolam after phenobarbital and phenytoin failed to achieve seizure control. Dosage schedule was 0.2 mg/kg IV, followed by continuous infusion of 0.025 mg/kg/h. Midazolam is an effective drug for neonatal status epilepticus and more experience should accumulate before it can be routinely employed in the neonatal period. This case shows that it is a possible option before using more dangerous drugs, such as thionembutal.", 
    "11": "Based on the receptor competitive binding assays in the mice and rat body, it has been proved that both diazepam and alpha-sec-butyl-p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (G-018) can inhibit 125I-G-018 binding with brain benzodiazepine receptor. Inhibiting effects were obvious in the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and midbrain. But in the medullao blongata and hypothalamus no inhibiting effect was observed. Experimental results have demonstrated that the inhibiting effect is consistent with distribution of benzodiazepine receptor in the brain. Also, experimental results have shown no difference between in vitro and in vivo. The G-018 binding with benzodiazepine receptor has been clarified under physiologic conditions.", 
    "12": "The preparation of 5-substituted 1-aryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3- c][1,8] naphthyridines by reaction of 5-substituted 3-hydroxymethylene-2,3-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-4(1H)-ones with various phenylhydrazines is described. The benzodiazepine binding activity of these compounds was evaluated in vitro. Only the 5-methyl substituted derivatives showed affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor, with K1 values ranging from 2.9 to 0.195 microM for the para-phenyl substituted compounds. A hypothesis of interaction of these ligands with the receptor site is reported.", 
    "13": "On 1 January 1989, in an effort to reduce diversion of benzodiazepines for illicit use and reduce inappropriate prescribing, a regulation was implemented requiring the reporting of all benzodiazepine prescriptions to the New York State Department of Health. To assess the impact of the regulation on prescribing practices to the elderly, we followed the number of benzodiazepines and other central nervous system medications prescribed to a cohort of participants in an elderly pharmaceutical insurance program. Benzodiazepines were prescribed for 4652 (22%) of the 20,944 patients studied. By the last quarter of 1989, benzodiazepines were prescribed for 3120 (15%) patients, a decrease of 33%. The number of prescriptions of benzodiazepines decreased by 5010 (45%), from 11,123 to 6113. Decreases in the number of prescriptions were similar across benzodiazepine brands (range 40-56%). Statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases were seen in all sex, age, race and marital status groups. Increases in number (and percent increases) of prescriptions for miscellaneous anxiolytics (i.e. hydroxyzine (399, 69%), meprobamate (299, 149%), buspirone (263, 111%), chloral hydrate (138, 265%), antidepressants (658, 19%), barbiturates (150, 29%), and tranquilizers (198, 19%), some of which may be more toxic or less effective, were noted. New York State's reporting regulation was effective in reducing both the number of patients being prescribed benzodiazepines and the number of prescriptions given to those who remain on benzodiazepines in the elderly population studies.", 
    "14": "Evidence from contemporary studies suggests that the quantification of adverse drug effects through state-of-the-art non-experimental methods may be confounded by some aspects of clinical practice. Support for this hypothesis is manifest in the finding that drug effects sometimes show within-study time trends when clinical practice with regard to drug use is evolving. Three studies which show simultaneous trends in prescription frequency and drug effects are discussed as examples. These include a study of benzodiazepines in the etiology of hip fracture, postmenopausal estrogens as a preventive for major coronary disease and human insulin as a risk factor for severe hypoglycemia. For instance, during a period when clinical perceptions regarding the safety of benzodiazepine use in the elderly underwent gradual change, the relative risk for hip fracture among long half-life benzodiazepine users declined progressively from 2.0 (95% CI, 1.6-2.5) in 1977-79 to 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9-1.8) in 1984-85. The implications of these observations are set against the scientific objectives which guide etiologic research.", 
    "15": "The new CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist PD 136450 is of potential value in treating neurologic and psychiatric disorders. We investigated possible side effects on the rat pancreas using acute and chronic administration schedules. In chronic experiments, four groups of rats were given either PD 136450, the proton pump inhibitor BY 308 (in order to induce hypergastrinemia), a combination of both, or control solutions over 14 d. Pancreatic growth, DNA, and protein content were significantly increased in rats given PD 136450 irrespective of circulating gastrin levels. Furthermore, an anticoordinate shift in pancreatic enzyme content in favor of trypsin and chymotrypsin at the expense of amylase and lipase was observed. Plasma CCK levels remained unchanged in this group making a role of circulating hormone unlikely. In order to investigate a possible direct agonist effect of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist, we studied amylase release from isolated rat pancreatic acini in response to PD 136450 and sulfated CCK8 alone and in combination with the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist MK 329. Increasing concentrations of PD 136450 caused a monophasic dose-response curve in contrast to the well-known biphasic amylase release in response to CCK8. Addition of increasing doses of PD 136450 to a concentration of CCK causing maximal stimulation of amylase release (0.1 nM) further enhanced amylase release from pancreatic acini. The specific CCK-A receptor antagonist MK 329 dose-dependently inhibited CCK8- and PD 136450-induced amylase release. In conclusion, the new CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist PD 136450 exhibited profound agonist actions on the rat pancreas mediated via CCK-A receptors.", 
    "16": "Tiapride, an atypical neuroleptic agent, is a selective dopamine D2-receptor antagonist with little propensity for causing catalepsy and sedation. It shows preferential activity at receptors previously sensitised to dopamine and those located extrastriatally. Tiapride demonstrates antidyskinetic activity reflecting antidopaminergic actions, and also anxiolytic activity mediated by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Unlike the benzodiazepines, tiapride does not affect vigilance and has a low potential for interaction with alcohol (ethanol), and possibly for abuse. Tiapride facilitates management of alcohol withdrawal, but its use in patients at risk of severe reactions in acute withdrawal should be accompanied by adjunct therapy for hallucinosis and seizures. Since it may prove difficult to identify such patients and there is also a small risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (particularly with parenteral administration), the usefulness of tiapride in this setting is likely to be limited. Nevertheless, relative freedom from the complications associated with benzodiazepine therapy suggest a possible role for the drug in the treatment of individuals suitable for alcohol detoxification as outpatients. Preliminary clinical studies in alcoholic patients following detoxification have shown that tiapride ameliorates psychological distress, improves abstinence, and reduces drinking behaviour, and in the short term facilitates reintegration within society. These benefits were associated with reduced consumption of health care resources. However, the potential risk of tardive dyskinesia at the dosage employed (300 mg/day) requires evaluation and necessitates medical supervision. Thus, with its lack of adverse effects on vigilance and low propensity for interaction with alcohol and possibly for abuse, tiapride will probably find particular use in the management of alcoholic patients suitable for detoxification in an outpatient setting; and, if initial findings are confirmed in large well-designed trials, in the short term (< or = 6 months) therapy of reformed alcoholic patients under medical supervision.", 
    "17": "Trans-synaptic modulation of cortical ACh efflux is a useful approach for determining the functions of cortical ACh. Bilateral modulation of basal forebrain GABAergic transmission by benzodiazepine-receptor agonists and inverse agonists decreases and increases, respectively, activated cortical ACh efflux. The determination of behavioral functions which are mediated via activated cortical ACh efflux, and therefore subject to the effects of basal forebrain GABA-cholinergic manipulations, should promote analyses of the functions of cortical ACh. Trans-synaptic approaches to enhance activated cortical ACh efflux offer some potential for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions associated with impaired cortical cholinergic transmission.", 
    "18": "Previous electrophysiological studies suggested that GABAA receptors in rat hippocampal neurons might be less sensitive to ethanol than mouse neurons. Therefore, we examined the effects of ethanol (0.5-850 mM) in cultured mouse (C57BL/6) and rat (Sprague-Dawley) neurons. In 35% of the mouse neurons, the Cl- current was potentiated by ethanol starting at 0.5 mM. In all of the rat neurons examined, on the other hand, the current was potentiated by concentrations starting at 200 mM. We also studied the effects of GABA and other GABAergic ligands. GABAA receptors in rat and mouse neurons displayed EC50s for GABA of 9 +/- 0.3 and 17 +/- 0.8 microM, respectively and ethanol did not significantly change these values. The EC50 for diazepam was 92 +/- 3 and 120 +/- 8 nM in rat and mouse, respectively. Pentobarbital enhanced the current with EC50s of 84 +/- 3 and 106 +/- 6 microM in rat and mouse, respectively. The sensitivity for Cl-218,872, which binds preferentially to the Type I benzodiazepine receptor, was similar in all the neurons. RO 15-4513, an inverse partial agonist to the benzodiazepine receptor, was not effective in reversing the potentiation of the Cl- current in rat neurons and only slightly reduced the potentiation in mouse neurons. The receptors in rat neurons were more sensitive to external Zn2+; the current was inhibited by 50% with a concentration of 93 +/- 3 and 244 +/- 9 microM in rat and mouse, respectively. Analysis of mRNA encoding for the gamma 2L receptor subunit showed similar levels in rat and mouse neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (2.5-20 mg/kg i.p.) increased acetylcholine (ACh) release by up to 85% in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor full agonist diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) decreased ACh release up to a maximum of 45% in the same brain area. Injection of flumazenil (10 pmol) or diazepam (10 pmol) into the medial septum increased (95%) or reduced (50%), respectively, ACh release in the hippocampus. The maximum effect produced by those drugs was of the same magnitude as that observed after systemic injection. The changes in hippocampal cholinergic function elicited by activation and blockade of benzodiazepine receptors in the medial septum may thus play a crucial role in the alterations of the cognitive processes elicited by benzodiazepine receptor ligands.", 
    "20": "In this study, we address the hypothesis that enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission following an ischemic episode is neuroprotective in the hippocampus. Mongolian gerbils were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia for 5 min by occlusion of the carotid arteries and then administered diazepam (10 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min or 30 and 90 min following ischemia. Diazepam produced a significant decrease in both rectal and brain temperature (4-6 degrees C) in the sham and ischemic gerbils. 1 day following the onset of reperfusion, diazepam substantially reduced the hyperactivity normally induced by the ischemic episode. 7 days later, neuronal viability in the hippocampus was assessed. The single dose of diazepam completely protected the CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus in 62% of the gerbils and the double dose of diazepam completely protected CA1 pyramidal neurons in 67% of the gerbils. There was a significant correlation between the degree of pyramidal cell degeneration in the CA1 area of the hippocampus measured 7 days following ischemia and the degree of hyperactivity measured 1 day following ischemia. Diazepam also prevented the loss of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to GABA-gated chloride channels in the dendritic fields of the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Our findings support the hypothesis that enhancement of GABA neurotransmission following an ischemic event may offset neuronal excitability and prevent neuronal death in specific brain regions. We conclude that GABA-enhancing drugs, such as diazepam, are attractive candidates as neuroprotective agents following ischemic insults.", 
    "21": "Administration of Triazolam (Tz)--a short acting benzodiazepine (BZ)--induces permanent phase-shifts in locomotor activity of golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). However, the target area(s) as well as the mechanism involved in the Tz-induced changes are not known. Previous results indicated that raphe nuclei (RN) would appear to be a likely site for Tz-induced phase shifts. Therefore, we specifically destroyed the 5-HT fibers connecting the RN with the SCN--the site of the endogenous mammalian clock--by microinjections of the selective neurotoxin 5,7 dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) at the level of SCN. Infusion of 5,7-DHT resulted in long lasting damage of the ascending serotonergic projection from RN to the hypothalamus. Subsequently, the phase-shifting effect of Tz was investigated. Only complete or almost complete depletion of the 5-HT input to the SCN was accompanied with a pronounced reduction of the phase shift together with a significant reduction of wheel-running activity during the 6 h following Tz injection. Our present results support the view that the 5-HT innervation of the SCN represents an essential link in the phase-shifting action following peripheral Tz injections.", 
    "22": "Effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (FG) on basal and reactive cardiovascular measures were examined in freely moving rats. FG (8 mg/kg) modestly increased basal heart period, but had no effects on basal blood pressure. More notably, however, FG augmented the cardioacceleratory response to an auditory stimulus relative to vehicle controls. Selective blockade of sympathetic (atenolol, 1 mg/kg) or parasympathetic (scopolamine methylnitrate, 0.1 mg/kg) effects on the heart under control conditions revealed that the stimulus-evoked cardiac response originated from a concurrent (reciprocal) sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal. Following FG pretreatment, both atenolol and scopolamine blocked the cardioacceleratory response to the auditory stimulus. Thus, although FG minimally increased basal heart period, FG significantly enhanced a reactive cardioacceleration. More importantly, these results demonstrate that the cardiovascular effects of BZR inverse agonists are more fully characterized by an assessment of both tonic and reactive cardiovascular responses.", 
    "23": "A library of 192 structurally diverse 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives containing a variety of chemical functionalities including amides, carboxylic acids, amines, phenols, and indoles was constructed from three components, 2-aminobenzophenones, amino acids, and alkylating agents, by employing Geysen's pin apparatus [Geysen, H. M., Rodda, S. J., Mason, T. J., Tribbick, G. & Schoofs, P. G. (1987) J. Immunol. Methods 102, 259-274]. Rigorous analytical verification of the chemical integrity and yield of a representative collection of the diverse derivatives was carried out. In addition, the library of derivatives was evaluated for binding to the cholecystokinin A receptor by employing a competitive radio-ligand binding assay. This provided detailed structure versus activity relationships that were confirmed by independent large-scale synthesis and evaluation of several of the 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "24": "The effect of intra-hippocampal (dentate gyrus) microinjections of the benzodiazepine, midazolam (10 micrograms per site, bilaterally), was examined in the Vogel conflict test in serotonin depleted rats (pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine). p-Chlorophenylalanine and midazolam, when given separately, significantly disinhibited rat conflict behavior. Midazolam retained its anticonflict potency in the p-chlorophenylalanine pretreated animals. These and other data indicate: (i) the specific involvement of limbic serotonin in emotional control, (ii) a dissociation of the effects of serotonin depletion and intra-hippocampal benzodiazepine on conflict behavior, and (iii) the important role of the hippocampus in processing emotional input.", 
    "25": "Duodenal or jejunal motility (monitored as pressure changes in a saline-perfused intraluminal catheter) was studied in anaesthetized rats, vagotomized and pretreated with adrenergic blocking agents. In the duodenum (but not the jejunum), atropine or the selective muscarinic M1 and M3 receptor antagonists, pirenzepine and 4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP), respectively, augmented the spontaneous contractile activity. This effect could be abolished either by nicotinic ganglionic receptor antagonism with hexamethonium, or with morphine. Moreover, blockade of the synthesis of nitric oxide by N omega-nitro-L-arginine elicited hypermotility both in the duodenum and the jejunum, and also this response was abolished by hexamethonium. It is proposed from the present results that the rat small is controlled by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory as well as excitatory motor neurons. The latter motor neurons seem to be modulated by muscarinic, nitroxergic or opioidergic mechanisms.", 
    "26": "Bilateral six-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions were placed in the amygdala of rats self-administering cocaine (1.5 mg/kg per injection i.v.) under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Post-lesion access to three doses of cocaine (1.5, 0.75 and 0.37 mg/kg per injection i.v.) revealed a lesion effect only at the highest dose. At this dose, the lesion caused a significant increase in breaking point. No change in the breaking point was produced at the lower two doses. The biochemical results show a significant reduction in dopamine and DOPAC levels within the amygdala and an increase in dopamine within the NACC. In contrast, noradrenaline and serotonin (5-HT) levels were unaffected by the lesion in any of the dissected areas. These results demonstrate that no specific effect on cocaine reinforcement was produced by 6-OHDA lesions of the amygdala. The possibility that the lesion may have attenuated the anxiogenic qualities of the high dose of cocaine is discussed.", 
    "27": "Steroids can modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor function in rat brains, but the physiological relevance of this mechanism is still unclear. To determine whether this phenomenon is widespread among vertebrates, we investigated steroid modulation of GABAA receptors in amphibian brain tissue. Equilibrium binding parameters for t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) and [3H]flunitrazepam were similar in Taricha granulosa and mammalian brains, as was the allosteric regulation of [35S]TBPS and [3H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA. The rank order and absolute potencies of steroids to inhibit [35S]TBPS binding and enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding were also similar in Taricha and rat brains. As in mammalian studies, physiological concentrations of corticosterone had no effect on ligand binding or GABA-stimulated Cl- uptake. In autoradiographic studies, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one inhibited [35S]TBPS binding sites in all brain regions examined, whereas corticosterone had no effect on [35S]TBPS binding. These studies suggest that the steroid recognition sites on GABAA receptors have been highly conserved through vertebrate evolution and thus portend physiologically important functions. However, the pharmacological profiles for the GABAA receptor and the high-affinity corticosteroid receptor are apparently different, suggesting there are multiple types of steroid recognition sites on neuronal membranes.", 
    "28": "Cases of fatal poisonings among drug addicts examined at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine in Aarhus (n = 238) and Oslo (n = 263) are compared and discussed on the basis of the availability of illicit and medical drugs during the 1980s. The annual number of deaths in age groups over 30 years increased in both countries. Heroin and/or morphine-related deaths comprised one-third of the Danish material compared with three-quarters of the Norwegian material. The registered medical drugs propoxyphene, methadone and ketobemidone accounted for half of the Danish cases. Alcohol and benzodiazepines were present in more than one-third of the cases in both countries.", 
    "29": "The strength of feedforward inhibition was assessed in the CA1 region of in vitro hippocampus of benzodiazepine tolerant rats 2 and 7 days after 1 week oral flurazepam (FZP) administration. Feedforward inhibition was activated with a Schaffer collateral stimulation just-subthreshold for a population spike followed at intervals of 10-100 ms by test population spikes elicited from the subicular side of the recording electrode. The amplitude of test spike was reduced to a lesser degree 2 days, but not 7 days, after FZP treatment, suggesting a decrease feedforward inhibition in treated rats coinciding with the time course for reversal of anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo.", 
    "30": "The electrophysiological effects of KST-5452 [3-(m-phenoxybenzylidene)-quinuclidine], an M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (muscarinic AChR) binding compound, were studied in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells transfected with m1 muscarinic AChR cDNA. Application of KST-5452 to m1-transformed NGPM1-27 cells elicited a sustained inward current associated with decreased conductance and reduced M-current relaxations at a holding potential of -20 mV. The KST-5452-induced responses were blocked by pirenzepine, suggesting that KST-5452 acts as a potent excitant via M1 muscarinic AChRs in brain neurons.", 
    "31": "In the course of our study concerning gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, we synthesized and characterized a labelled gastrin ligand, [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) (3-(3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionyl[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17)). On isolated canine fundic mucosal cells and human Jurkat lymphoblastic cell line, known to express CCKB/gastrin receptors, the binding experiments performed indicate that [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) provides a convenient biologically active ligand for cholecystokinin/gastrin receptor studies. We showed in this study that, on guinea-pig brain membranes known to possess CCKB and CCKA receptors, [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) binds to a single class of high-affinity binding sites in a saturable and specific manner. [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) interacts with guinea-pig brain membranes with a maximal binding capacity that is about three-fold lower than that of [125I]BHCCK8 (CCK8, the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin). The apparent affinities of CCK analogues and selective CCK receptor antagonists L-365,260 and MK-329 for the sites labelled by both probes were in accordance with a CCKB-like profile. Association-dissociation kinetics of [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) and [125I]BHCCK8 were performed and compared. They showed that [125I]BHCCK8 equilibrated more slowly than [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17). The effects of pH, monovalent and divalent cations on binding of both probes were investigated. The results obtained did not indicate strong differences between [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) and [125I]BHCCK8 binding. Binding experiments in the presence of stable analogues of GTP showed a different behavior between [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) and [125I]BHCCK8. GTP gamma S strongly decreased [125I]BH[Leu15]gastrin-(5-17) binding whereas it weakly affected [125I]BHCCK8 binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "Several endogenous steroids exert their neuroactivity through non-genomic effects and act as potent GABAA receptor-agonists or-antagonists. To examine the influence of the main precursor of these steroids on sleep-wake behaviour, pregnenolone (400 micrograms) was dissolved in oil and administrated s.c. to 8 rats at the beginning of the light period. For comparison, the benzodiazepine midazolam was also injected (3 mg/kg). The effects on the amounts of the vigilance states and on the EEG signals within each state were investigated during 24 hours. Compared to control vehicle, pregnenolone did not significantly affect the duration of the vigilance states. However, delta activity (0.5-4 Hz) within non-rapid eye movement sleep (nonREMS) was enhanced throughout the recording period. Midazolam increased nonREMS, decreased wakefulness and, transiently, also suppressed rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Spectral analysis of the EEG within nonREMS showed a long lasting reduction in delta and theta activity (4-9 Hz) and a shorter lasting enhancement in the higher frequencies (10-25 Hz). EEG activity within REMS and wakefulness was elevated in the higher frequencies (> or = 10 Hz) during the the first half of the recording period. We conclude that in the rat, the effects of midazolam on EEG activity closely resemble those of benzodiazepines in other mammalian species. The influence of pregnenolone on EEG delta activity within nonREMS indicates that pregnenolone acts as an inverse GABAA-benzodiazepine agonist.", 
    "33": "The effects of the centrally produced allylic neurosteroid, 3 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3 alpha HP), on the responses of male mice to the odors of estrous female mice were examined in an odor preference test. Control untreated mice displayed a significant preference for the odors of an estrous female, spending more time in a Y-maze in the vicinity of the odors of an estrous than a non-estrous female. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administrations of 3 alpha HP enhanced male preference for the odors of estrous females, causing a significant dose-related (0.01-1.0 microgram) increase in the amount of time spent in the proximity of the odors of the estrous female, while having no significant effect on the responses to the non-estrous female odors. These effects of 3 alpha HP were stereospecific, with the stereoisomer, 3 beta-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3 beta HP), having no significant effects on odor preferences. The analgesic, morphine, also had no significant effects on the responses to female odors suggesting that the enhanced preference for estrous female odors were unlikely to be directly due to any analgesic effects of 3 alpha HP. The effects of 3 alpha HP were significantly reduced by peripheral administrations of the GABAA antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, but were unaffected by either the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, or the opiate antagonist, naloxone. These results suggest that the neurosteroid 3 alpha HP has facilitatory effects on olfactory mediated male sexual interest or motivation that involve interactions with the GABAA receptor.", 
    "34": "Inhibition in primary sensory cortex plays a role in neuronal responses to peripheral stimuli. For many neurons in cat primary somatosensory cortex, blockade of GABAA receptors by bicuculline results in receptive field enlargement. The magnitude of this effect varies with the neuron's adaptation characteristics and its location in particular laminae and submodality regions. To test whether these variations are correlated with the distribution of GABAA receptors, we analyzed [3H]muscimol binding in cat primary somatosensory and motor cortical areas. The highest levels of binding were in layers I-III, and the lowest levels were in layers V-VI. In somatosensory cortical areas, layer IV was distinguished by higher levels of binding than in adjacent layers. Within layer IV, levels of binding were significantly higher in posterior area 3b than in anterior area 3b. These differences may correspond to the rapidly adapting and slowly adapting submodality regions which have been described in this area. The laminar distribution of [3H]muscimol binding differed from that of [3H]flunitrazepam, and neither resembled the distribution of the magnitude of bicuculline's effects on receptive field size. The laminar distribution of [3H]muscimol binding was highly correlated with the areal density of GABA-immunoreactive neurons described in a companion study.", 
    "35": "Several candidate retinoid antagonists were designed on the basis of the ligand superfamily concept and synthesized. Retinoidal activities of these benzimidazole and benzodiazepine derivatives were examined by assay of differentiation-inducing activity on human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. The parent benzimidazole derivative, 4-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8- tetramethylnaphth-[2,3-d]imidazol-2-yl)benzoic acid (7a), and related compounds with a small alkyl group instead of the hydrogen on the nitrogen (1N) atom of the imidazole ring exhibited retinoidal activity, and the potency strongly depended on the bulkiness of the substituent. The compounds having a phenyl or benzyl group on the nitrogen lacked differentiation-inducing activity on HL-60 cells and acted as antagonists to the potent retinoid 4-[(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8- tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)carbamoyl]benzoic acid (Am80). Among the compounds possessing a seven-membered heterocyclic ring as a linking group, 4-(5H-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-5,7,7,10,10- pentamethylbenzo[e]- naphtho[2,3-b][1,4]diazepin-13-yl)benzoic acid (16) also exhibited the antagonistic activity. The binding abilities of these compounds to retinoic acid receptors alpha and beta were consistent with their potency for the inhibition of HL-60 cell differentiation induced by the retinoid Am80.", 
    "36": "A novel class of ligands specific for MBR receptors has been identified: 6-arylpyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepine derivatives. The majority of newly synthesized esters 37-64 as well as some intermediate ketones showed micro- or nanomolar affinity for [3H]PK 11195 binding inhibition. A SAR study on 42 compounds and a molecular modeling approach led to a preliminary structural selectivity profile: the 6,7-double bond, the carbamoyloxy, alcanoyloxy, and mesyloxy side chains at the 7-position, and the prospective chloro substitution at the 4-position seemed to be the most important structural features improving affinity. Therefore, 7-[(dimethylcarbamoyl)oxy]- and 7-acetoxy-4-chloro-6-phenylpyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepine (43 and 57) were synthesized. With 7-[(dimethylcarbamoyl)oxy]-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolo[2,1- d][1,5]benzothiazepine (65), these were the most promising compounds with IC50s of respectively 9, 8, and 9 nM, under conditions where PK 11195 had an IC50 of 2 nM.", 
    "37": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic assay coupled with UV detection (254 nm) has been developed for the determination of midazolam and two of its hydroxylated metabolites, 1-hydroxymidazolam (1-OH) and 4-hydroxymidazolam (4-OH), in human plasma. Following a novel solid-phase extraction procedure, midazolam and its metabolites are well recovered from plasma. The analytes were extracted with C1 cartridges and the extracts were evaporated to dryness. The dry residues were dissolved in 200 microliters of mobile phase [0.02 M ammonium phosphate monobasic buffer-methanol-acetonitrile (60:35:5, v/v) (300 ml), 600 microliters of 0.2 M tetrabutylammonium bromide solution, adjusted to a pH* (apparent pH) of 4.10]. The separation of the analytes was performed on a Spherisorb C8 column (10 cm x 4.6 mm I.D.) maintained at 30 degrees C. The mobile phase was pumped at a flow-rate of 1.5 ml/min. The method has a lower limit of quantitation of 15 ng/ml of plasma for midazolam and proved to be reproducible (inter-assay precision 5.4%) and accurate (94 +/- 5%) over the therapeutic range of concentrations.", 
    "38": "Receptor autoradiographic methods specific for M3 and M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors were used to investigate the development and input-dependent laminar redistribution of these receptor populations during the critical period for kitten visual cortex plasticity. Analysis of the binding curves of [3H]4-diphenylacetyl-N-methyl-piperidine (4-DAMP) and [3H]pirenzepine (PZ) indicated that these two ligands bound heterogeneously to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with different affinities. While [3H]4-DAMP showed a high affinity for M3 receptors and much lower affinities for M1 and M2 receptors, [3H]PZ displayed higher affinity for M1 receptors. By carefully choosing concentrations of labelled and unlabeled ligands, the patterns of laminar distribution for both receptor subtypes within visual cortex were obtained. Both receptors were most concentrated in cortical layer IV immediately after birth and during the most sensitive period of visual cortex plasticity. The binding density for both receptor subtypes thinned out progressively in this layer to concentrate in more superficial layers as plasticity waned with age. Moreover, interruption of visual or spontaneous input to visual cortex induced either by lesion or by tetrodotoxin infusion into lateral geniculate nucleus prevented the developmental redistribution of these receptors from layer IV to superficial layers, that is, the pattern of laminar distribution remained that of the age at which the lesion or tetrodotoxin infusion into the lateral geniculate nucleus was performed. The results indicate that the developmental expression of M3 and M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in kitten visual cortex depends on cortical inputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The interaction of cocaine, its metabolites norcocaine and benzoylecgonine, and cocaethylene, which is formed following a combined cocaine and ethanol exposure, with muscarinic receptor binding and phosphoinositide metabolism was investigated in brain from immature rats. Cocaine and norcocaine inhibited binding of [3H]telenzepine and carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism in cerebral cortex, while benzoylecgonine was devoid of any inhibitory activity. Cocaethylene was the most potent inhibitor of both binding and phosphoinositide metabolism. The effect of cocaine was more pronounced at the muscarinic receptors, but a small inhibition of histamine--and serotonin--stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism was also observed.", 
    "40": "In the enteric nervous system, direct effects on peptidergic neurotransmitter release are difficult to assess since the neuronal network predisposes to numerous interactions between the various transmitter systems. The aim of the present study was to examine the release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity from isolated nerve synapses of the enteric nervous system. Enriched synaptosomal fractions were obtained by using homogenized tissue from rat ileum, which was subjected to various steps of differential and sucrose density centrifugation. Specific binding of [3H]saxitoxin served as a marker for neuronal membranes. For comparison, the content of bombesin-like immunoreactivity was determined. Both the enriched synaptosomal fraction (mitochondrial fraction II or P2) and the purified synaptosomal fraction (F2), obtained after discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation, showed substantial enrichment of the neuronal marker [3H]saxitoxin and bombesin-like immunoreactivity. The basal release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity was 52 +/- 17 pg/mg (100%). KCl-evoked depolarization (65 mM) significantly stimulated the release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity to 142.2% (P < 0.05, n = 17). The release was abolished in Ca(2+)-free medium. Stimulation of the release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity was also observed in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A-23187 (10(-6) M: 129%, P < 0.05, n = 17), supporting the role of Ca2+ in the release process. Cholinergic stimulation with carbachol elicited a significant dose-dependent release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity (10(-8) M: 106%, 10(-7) M: 175%, P < 0.05, 10(-6) M: 156%, P < 0.05, 10(-5) M: 115%, n = 14), which was reduced by atropine (10(-6) M: 99%, P < 0.01, n = 14). The basal value was 67 +/- 9 pg/mg (100%). The different effects of the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine, which stimulated release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity in combination with carbachol 10(-6) M (10(-6) M: 123%, n = 10), and of the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist AFDX 116, which attenuated release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity evoked by carbachol (10(-5) M: 66%, P < 0.01, 10(-6) M: 88%, n = 10), strongly suggest modulation of the release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity at the presynaptic receptor site through an excitatory muscarinic M2 receptor. The basal value was 46 +/- 9 pg/mg (100%). In summary, bombesin-like immunoreactivity can be released from these synaptosomes by both depolarization with KCl in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and by cholinergic stimulation. The synaptosomes of intrinsic nerves of the gut offer an approach to study the release of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters at the subcellular level independent of the ganglionic network.", 
    "41": "Type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors of the mammalian nervous system are a family of ligand-gated ion channels probably formed from the coassembly of different subunits (alpha 1-6, beta 1-3, gamma 1-3, delta) in the arrangement alpha beta gamma or alpha beta delta. The activation of these receptors by GABA can be modulated by a range of compounds acting at distinct allosteric sites. One such compound is the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant loreclezole, which we have recently shown to act via a specific modulatory site on the beta subunit of the GABAA receptor. The action of loreclezole depends on the type of beta subunit present in the receptor complex; receptors containing beta 2 or beta 3 subunits have > 300-fold higher affinity for loreclezole than receptors containing a beta 1 subunit. We have used this property to identify the amino acid residue in the beta subunit that determines the subunit selectivity of loreclezole. Chimeric beta 1/beta 2 human GABAA receptor subunits were constructed and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with human alpha 1 and gamma 2s subunits. The chimera beta 1/beta 2Lys237-Gly334 conferred sensitivity to 1 microM loreclezole. Within this region there are four amino acids that are conserved in beta 2 and beta 3 but differ in beta 1. By mutating single amino acids of the beta 1 subunit to the beta 2/beta 3 equivalent, only the beta 1 mutation of Ser-290-->Asn conferred potentiation by loreclezole. Similarly, mutation of the homologous residue in the beta 2 and beta 3 subunits to the beta 1 equivalent (Asn-->Ser) resulted in loss of sensitivity to loreclezole. The affinity for GABA and the potentiation by flunitrazepam were unchanged in receptors containing the mutated beta subunits. Thus, a single amino acid, beta 2 Asn-289 (beta 3 Asn-290), located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the putative channel-lining domain TM2, confers sensitivity to the modulatory effects of loreclezole.", 
    "42": "Mutations in the gene for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been detected in some families with an autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; these mutations appear to reduce the activity of this enzyme. To determine whether decreased SOD activity could contribute to motor neuron loss, SOD1 was inhibited chronically with either antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or diethyldithiocarbamate in spinal cord organotypic cultures. Chronic inhibition of SOD resulted in the apoptotic degeneration of spinal neurons, including motor neurons, over several weeks. Motor neuron loss was markedly potentiated by the inhibition of glutamate transport. In this paradigm, motor neuron toxicity could be entirely prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and, to a lesser extent, by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride. These data support the hypothesis that the loss of motor neurons in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis could be due to a reduction in SOD1 activity, possibly potentiated by inefficient glutamate transport.", 
    "43": "The haem precursors delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), over-produced in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), may mediate porphyric neuropathy. Porphyrins bind to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, putative mitochondrial porphyrin translocation sites. In AIP, ALA and PBG may interfere with porphyrin transport causing a deficit in essential haemoproteins. The effects of ALA, PBG and protoporphyrin 1X on the binding of [3H]-PK 11195 to platelets were examined. Ligand binding was also examined in platelets from porphyric patients. The haem precursor protoporphyrin 1X (10 microM) caused an increase in Kd values (p < 0.05) whereas Bmax values remained unaltered. Neither ALA (10 microM) nor PBG (10 microM) altered ligand binding. Patient platelets showed no change in ligand binding values. ALA and PBG are unlikely to compete with porphyrins for peripheral benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "44": "Previous work demonstrated that paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) leads to a decrease in yawning behavior elicited by cholinergic agonists, suggesting that a downregulation of cholinergic muscarinic receptors may occur after PSD. More recent work using intracerebral injections of muscarinic agonists has suggested a critical role for M2 receptors in paradoxical sleep. In this study [3H]AF-DX 384 was used to investigate the effects of PSD on M2-type cholinergic receptors throughout the brain using quantitative autoradiography. After 96 h of paradoxical sleep deprivation, [3H]AF-DX 384 binding was generally reduced throughout the brain, and significantly so in the olfactory tubercle (-20%), n. accumbens (-23%), frontal caudate-putamen (-16%), islands of Callejas (-20%), piriform cortex (-24%), lateral (-26%) and medial (-24%) septum, anteromedial (-19%), ventrolateral (-22%), and lateral geniculate (-15%) nuclei of thalamus, deep layers of the superior colliculus (-15%), entorhinal cortex (-12%) and subiculum (-23%). [3H]AF-DX 384 binding was reduced in pontine structures, but not to a higher degree than in other brain areas. The observed downregulation of M2-type muscarinic receptors after PSD may be causally related to the previously reported decrease in cholinergically induced behaviors after PSD.", 
    "45": "The effect of diazepam on the development of morphine tolerance and dependence was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered tolerant and dependent by subcutaneous implantation of six morphine pellets. Diazepam (0.025, 0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg body weight) was once daily injected intraperitoneally into rats starting on the first day of implantation. Antinociception was measured by tail-flick (TF) and hot plate (HP) tests, and the extent of sedation determined by a rotarod test before and one hour after diazepam injections everyday for 5 days. Physical dependence on morphine was assessed by an antagonist-precipitated abstinence syndrome on the fifth day of treatment by injecting naloxone 10 mg/kg subcutaneously. Diazepam (0.025-2.5 mg/kg body weight) did not produce significant antinociception or sedation (sensorimotor impairment) in rats implanted with placebo pellets. Diazepam (0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) inhibited tolerance to TF antinociception in rats implanted with morphine pellets. Sedation as evidenced by sensorimotor impairment induced by morphine pellet implantation was not influenced by diazepam (0.025-2.5 mg/kg). Diazepam administration (0.25 mg/kg) also decreased the degree of jumping behavior observed following naloxone injection in morphine pellet implanted rats. Serum morphine concentration in morphine-diazepam treated rats was not significantly different from that in morphine-saline treated rats. Finally, a decrease in the Met-enkephalin levels observed in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex and spinal cord of morphine dependent rats was reversed by injecting diazepam along with morphine pellet implantation. These results suggest that diazepam inhibits morphine tolerance and dependence, and also prevents morphine-induced decrease in the CNS Met-enkephalin levels in morphine dependent rats.", 
    "46": "The effects of the centrally produced allylic neurosteroid, 3 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3 alpha HP), on the responses of male mice to an aversive, anxiety-inducing, predator (cat) odor were examined in an odor preference test. Control untreated mice displayed an anxiogenic response to the cat odor, spending a minimal amount of time in a Y-maze in the vicinity of the cat odor. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administrations of 3 alpha HP had an anxiolytic action, resulting in significant dose-related (0.01-1.0 micrograms) increases in the amount of time spent in the proximity of the cat odor. These anxiolytic effects of 3 alpha HP were stereospecific, with the stereoisomer, 3 beta-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3 beta HP) having no significant effects on odor preferences. The analgesic, morphine, also had no significant effects on the response to cat odor indicating that the anxiolytic actions of 3 alpha HP were unlikely to be related to any analgesic effects. The effects of 3 alpha HP were significantly reduced by peripheral administrations of the GABAA antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, but were unaffected by either the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, or the opiate antagonist, naloxone. These results indicate that the allylic neurosteroid 3 alpha HP has anxiolytic actions involving interactions with the GABAA receptor.", 
    "47": "Astrocytes appear to be the primary source of peripheral benzodiazepine (PBZD) receptors in brain. The function of this receptor is not well understood. Since there is evidence that this receptor may be involved in cell volume control, we examined the effect of hypoosmotic stress on the regulation of the PBZD receptors in homogenates of cultured astrocytes derived from neonatal rat cerebral cortex. Exposure of astrocytes that were maintained in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP) to hypoosmotic medium (200 mOsm) for 24 h resulted in 27 and 57% increased in the number of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro5-4864-binding sites, respectively, as compared with isoosmotic media (320 mOsm). This receptor upregulation is osmolarity- and time-dependent. However, hypoosmotic stress had no effect on PBZD receptor-binding in astrocytes that were maintained in the absence of dBcAMP. Under isoosmotic conditions, dBcAMP appears to regulate [3H]Ro5-4864 but not [3H]PK 11195-binding sites, a finding which further supports a partial distinction between the binding sites labeled with these ligands. The modulation of PBZD receptors by hypoosmotic stress suggests a possible role for these receptor sites in astrocyte volume control.", 
    "48": "The effects of the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine HCl) on haloperidol-induced catalepsy were tested in drug-naive rats and in rats pretreated with the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CGP 37849 (DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid). CGP 37849 (4 mg/kg i.p.) given alone significantly reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) while GYKI 52466 (4.8 mg/kg i.p.) given alone was without effect. Administration of GYKI 52466 to rats pretreated with CGP 37849 abolished the anticataleptic effects of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist seen following single administration. Thus the AMPA receptor antagonist prevents behavioural effects induced by a NMDA receptor antagonist in this behavioural model.", 
    "49": "The experiments presented here demonstrate an aspecific effect of the benzodiazepine derivative flunitrazepam (FNZ). It differs in sites and mechanisms of action, both from benzodiazepine (BZ) specific effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) blocking transmission via central BZ receptors and from BZ effects mediated by peripheral BZ receptors. The aspecific effect of FNZ can suitably be examined on isolated and identified neurons of the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis (pond snail). The physiological sites of action are outside the synaptic zone, on the neuron somatic membrane and affect 'intrinsic' properties of membrane, including calcium, calcium-activated potassium and chloride channels. The aspecific FNZ effect exerts an influence on the metabolism of the cell by decreasing the permeability of the calcium channel, diminishing the excitability of the neuron membrane, and hyperpolarizing the cell, thus potentiating the specific effect of FNZ. The senile alterations of the neuron function intensify the aspecific effects of FNZ to such a degree that it must be taken seriously in consideration in anesthesia of elderly patients.", 
    "50": "The enantiomers of [N-methyl-11C]PK 11195, a radioligand for PET studies of PK (peripheral benzodiazepine) binding sites, have been prepared from the newly synthesized N-desmethyl-enantiomers by 11C-methylation with N.C.A. [11C]iodomethane. The brain uptake and retention of each enantiomer was compared with that of the racemic radioligand after i.v. administration into normal rats and into rats with focal cortical lesions. No significant differences in the uptakes of the enantiomers were observed in regions devoid of PK binding sites. However, the R-enantiomer was retained to a significantly greater extent than the S-enantiomer in olfactory bulbs-tubercles, which contain some PK binding sites, and also in 9-day-old focal cortical lesions, which are greatly enriched in PK binding sites associated with macrophage infiltration. The observed differences are consistent with the approximately 2-fold greater affinity of the R-enantiomer for PK binding sites reported in vitro and imply that the use of this enantiomer would have advantages over the use of the racemate currently used for PET studies.", 
    "51": "Five rats were trained on a concurrent schedule in which responses on one lever produced a food pellet on a random-interval 30-s schedule during 10 s of food availability associated with distinctive exteroceptive stimuli. Responses on another lever postponed for 20 s the presentation of a 50-s timeout, during which all stimuli were extinguished and the schedule contingencies on the food lever were suspended. The response rates maintained by the random-interval schedule exceeded those maintained by the avoidance contingency, but both provided a stable baseline to assess the behavioral effects of different drugs. Low doses of cocaine hydrochloride (1 and 3 mg/kg) did not affect food-reinforced responding or avoidance response rates. Intermediate doses (5.6, 10, and 13 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in food-maintained and avoidance response rates, and both types of responding were virtually eliminated after administration of the highest doses (17 and 30 mg/kg) of cocaine. Low doses of chlordiazepoxide (1 and 3 mg/kg) increased food-maintained and avoidance response rates, and both rates decreased systematically after 10 and 30 mg/kg of this drug. The effects of cocaine and chlordiazepoxide on response rates maintained by avoidance of timeout from food presentation were unlike those reported when subjects responded to avoid shock presentation. The results of this experiment thus provide evidence to suggest that the effects of drug administration on avoidance behavior may be a function of the nature of the consequent event to be avoided.", 
    "52": "Oxazepam has been the subject of recent toxicological and carcinogenesis studies because it is a commonly prescribed tranquilizer and has been shown to cause tumors in rodents. In this study, male and female B6C3F1 mice received 0, 125, 2500 or 5000 p.p.m. oxazepam in the diet for up to 2 years. Hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, as well as hepatoblastomas, which developed in these mice, were examined for the presence of activated ras proto-oncogenes. DNA was isolated from 20 or more tumors from each exposure group and analyzed by oligonucleotide hybridization, single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified H-ras gene fragments for codon 61 mutations. Thirteen of 37 (35%) hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas from the 125 p.p.m. exposure group had mutations in codon 61, while mutations were detected in only 2 of 25 or 8% of the liver tumors from the 2500 p.p.m. exposure group and none of the 22 tumors from the 5000 p.p.m. group. This compares to 63% of 126 historical control liver tumors and 55% of 20 liver tumors from unexposed B6C3F1 mice in this study. In addition, 12 hepatoblastomas from the two high dose groups were examined for H-ras mutations at codon 61, but none were detected. No tumor DNAs from any of the exposure groups tested had mutations in codons 12, 13 or 117 of the H-ras gene or codons 12 or 13 of the K-ras gene, the other known hotspots for ras activation in mouse liver tumors. These results, together with those from the National Toxicology Program study showing no evidence of cytotoxicity or genotoxicity by oxazepam, suggest that oxazepam preferentially promotes cells that have activating lesions other than ras.",

A comparison of ligand-binding properties revealed a functional role for individual beta variants, which depended on the alpha subunit in the GABAA receptor. Recombinant alpha 5 beta x gamma 2/3 receptors recognized the cage convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate, as well as the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor inverse agonist [3H]Ro 15-4513, only with the beta 3 variant. In contrast, the exchange of beta variants in alpha 1 beta x gamma 2 receptors imparted differential modulation of t-butyl-bicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate binding by BZ receptor ligands. The BZ site of gamma 3-containing receptors was partially independent of the accompanying alpha and beta variants. alpha 1/5 beta 3 gamma 3 receptors were zolpidem insensitive but distinguished from alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors by high affinity for the partial BZ receptor agonist CI 218,872. The distinct affinities of recombinant receptors for CI 218,872 suggested that the alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2 receptor is the dominant zolpidem-insensitive GABAA receptor in the brain. Hence, alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 3 recpetors are not a major fraction of the native zolpidem-insensitive receptors, even though their genes are colocalized on mouse chromosome 7 and on human chromosome 15.",

Currently it is advised that flumazenil should not be used routinely in all patients with altered mental status, but when used selectively, it is a very safe and extremely useful antidote.", 
    "55": "The neuroprotective actions of cholecystokinin (CCK) peptides were investigated in a mouse hypoxia model, in which the animals were successively exposed to CO gas. Working memory impairment 5 days after CO exposure was examined by using a Y-maze test; delayed amnesia was examined 7 days after CO exposure, by using a step-down type passive avoidance test. Ceruletide (1-100 micrograms/kg, given s.c. 30 min before CO exposure) significantly prevented the CO-induced impairment of performance in both tests, the improvement being correlated with the severity of hypoxia. This severity was increased by maintaining the body temperature at 38 degrees C. Ceruletide was less effective when injected immediately after a single CO exposure. The order of potency of the CCK-peptides administered systemically was: ceruletide > CCK-8S > CCK-8NS > CCK-4. Ceruletide (0.03-0.3 micrograms/mouse) and CCK-8S (0.03-1 microgram/mouse) prevented CO-induced amnesia after i.c.v. administration. Under all experimental conditions, dizocilpine [MK-801, (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate, 500 micrograms/kg s.c. or 10 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.] prevented completely the CO-induced amnesia. The protective effects of systemic ceruletide were blocked, partially but significantly, by the preadministration of L-364,718 (3S-(-)-N-[2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-S-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-yl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide, 1-10 mg/kg i.p.), a selective CCK-A receptor antagonist.

    "56": "In this investigation a newly developed direct cortical stimulation technique was evaluated for measurement of anticonvulsant efficacy in rats. The kinetics of drug action for carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, ethosuximide and oxazepam were studied in conjunction with their pharmacokinetics. Motor cortex stimulation with a ramp-shaped pulse train allowed successive determination of a threshold for localized seizure activity (TLS) and for generalized seizure activity (TGS). For each drug the time course of effect was followed in individual animals. Differential effects on the pharmacodynamic parameters were seen. Phenytoin and carbamazepine clearly elevated the TGS. However, phenytoin did not affect TLS and carbamazepine only marginally. Valproate increased both TLS and TGS to the same extent. Phenobarbital and oxazepam elevated both thresholds, but the effect on TGS was more pronounced. Ethosuximide had little effect on both thresholds. Comparison with other animal models suggested that elevation of TLS reflects an effect on seizure initiation, whereas elevation of TGS above TLS reflects an effect on seizure propagation. All drugs exhibited a nonlinear relationship between plasma concentration and anticonvulsant efficacy, without ceiling of anticonvulsant intensity at the highest concentrations. The effective concentration range of most compounds coincided with the \"therapeutic\" range in humans. The direct cortical stimulation technique is useful for preclinical monitoring of anticonvulsant efficacy with most antiepileptic drugs because it allows detection of both qualitative and quantitative differences. In addition the model is particularly useful for time course studies.", 
    "57": "Bergmann glial cells are closely associated with neurons: during development they provide guiding structures for migrating granule cells and in the adult cerebellum they display intimate interactions with Purkinje cells. In this study, we have addressed the question of whether such changes in neuronal-glial interactions during development are accompanied by variations in the membrane properties of Bergmann glial cells. We used a mouse cerebellum slice preparation to study membrane currents of the Bergmann glial cells at various stages of development in situ using the patch-clamp technique. The distinct morphology of Bergmann glial cells was revealed by Lucifer yellow injections during recording. While Bergmann glial cells in mice of postnatal day 20 (P20) to P30 have thick processes with arborized, irregularly shaped leaf-like appendages, the processes of cells from younger mice (P5-P7) are thinner and smoother. This morphological maturation is accompanied by a variation in voltage-gated currents. In cells from P5 to P7, delayed outward- and inward-rectifying K+ currents were recorded, while older Bergmann glial cells were characterized by, large, voltage- and time-independent K+ currents. In addition, application of GABA induces two effects, a rapid activation of a Cl- conductance and a longer-lasting decrease in the (resting) K+ conductance. Both effects were mediated by benzodiazepine-insensitive GABAA receptors. Responses in cells of P5-P7 mice were large as compared to the small or even undetectable responses in P20-P30 cells. These GABAA receptors were characterized immunohistochemically in mice and rat brain sections with five subunit-specific antibodies. Bergmann glial cells exhibit a distinct but transient immunoreactivity for the GABAA receptor alpha 2-, alpha 3-, and delta-subunits. Staining is maximal between P7 and P10 and decreases gradually thereafter. In contrast, antibodies to the alpha 1- and beta 2,3-subunits fail to decorate Bergmann glial cells, although they yield a prominent staining of both the Purkinje cells and the granule cells. These changes in the Bergmann glial cell membrane properties and GABAA receptor expression suggest a transition between functional states during development of the Bergmann glial cells.",

Venous plasma concentrations of temazepam were measured by HPLC in samples obtained between 0 and 24 hours. Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated up to 8 hours for saccadic peak velocity and electroencephalogram (EEG) beta amplitudes. Subjects' state and trait anxiety were assessed by use of the Spielberger anxiety inventory.", 
    "60": "Significant correlations between occasions were found for area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values (r = 0.91; p < 0.01) but not for maximum concentration and half-life. Significant correlations were also found for area under the effect-time curve (AUEC) values of peak velocity (r = 0.88; p < 0.01) but not for peak velocity (r = 0.48; p > 0.05). Significant differences between the slopes of concentration effect plots on different occasions were observed in two subjects for EEG beta and in three subjects for peak velocity, with one subject showing a similar change for both parameters. Trait anxiety scores were higher on the first occasion (33 +/- 7) than on the second occasion (29 +/- 7; p < 0.01). A negative correlation was found between trait anxiety scores and the slopes of concentration-effect plots for peak velocity (r = -0.63; p < 0.01).",

    "63": "This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in an academic department of clinical pharmacology. Subjects were nine healthy volunteers. A computerized infusion pump was used to obtain target plasma concentrations of temazepam after 30 or 120 minutes and to maintain these levels for 2 hours. A vehicle infusion, similar to the 30-minute (fast) infusion was used as a placebo control. Infusion schedules were based on data obtained from individual subjects after infusion of 0.4 mg/kg temazepam in 30 minutes. Target plasma concentrations were chosen to induce subhypnotic effects and averaged (+/- SD) 597 +/- 123 ng/ml. Venous plasma concentrations of temazepam were measured by HPLC. Free fractions of temazepam were assessed at the start of the pseudo steady-state concentration intervals. Electroencephalogram alpha and beta amplitudes, saccadic peak velocity, and saccadic latency were used as pharmacodynamic parameters.", 
    "64": "The rate of change of plasma concentrations averaged 21 +/- 4 ng/ml.min-1 during fast infusion and 5 +/- 1 ng/ml.min-1 during slow infusion of temazepam. Average pseudo steady-state concentrations were 639 +/- 132 ng/ml after fast infusion and 629 +/- 133 ng/ml after slow infusion. At the onset of pseudo steady-state concentration intervals the average free fractions of temazepam were 44% (95% confidence interval, 19% to 61%) lower for slow than for fast infusions. Compared with the slow infusion, electroencephalogram beta amplitudes were significantly larger during the first 30 minutes of pseudo steady-state concentration after fast infusion of temazepam. No significant differences were found for the other parameters. There was a slight decline of temazepam effects during the pseudo steady-state concentration intervals for all parameters after the fast infusion and for saccadic peak velocity and saccadic latency after the slow infusion.", 
    "65": "The pharmacodynamic effects of intravenous temazepam may depend partly on the rate of administration. Differences in pharmacodynamic effects after fast and slow infusions could be caused by changes in protein binding over time.", 
    "66": "Interaction between ketoconazole, itraconazole, and midazolam was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study of three phases at intervals of 4 weeks. Nine volunteers were given either 400 mg ketoconazole, 200 mg itraconazole, or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days. On day 4, the subjects ingested 7.5 mg midazolam. Plasma samples were collected and psychomotor performance was measured. Both ketoconazole and itraconazole increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve from 10 to 15 times (p < 0.001) and mean peak concentrations three to four times (p < 0.001) compared with the placebo phase. In psychomotor tests (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test), the interaction was statistically significant (p < 0.05) until at least 6 hours after drug administration. Inhibition of the cytochrome P450IIIA by ketoconazole and itraconazole may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Prescription of midazolam for patients receiving ketoconazole and itraconazole should be avoided.", 
    "67": "Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine proven to be efficacious in sedation, hypnosis, and induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Because of its water solubility, it is a desirable drug for the control of status epilepticus when intravenous (IV) access is not obtainable. This study compares intramuscular (IM) versus IV routes of administration of midazolam in the control of tonic-clonic activity produced by chemically induced generalized seizures in a swine model. When midazolam was administered by IV route, tonic-clonic activity lasted a mean of 34 +/- 5.4 seconds, and when administered by IM route, the tonic-clonic activity lasted a mean of 116 +/- 41 seconds. Both were considerably abbreviated when compared with the expected duration of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in the swine model. Serum levels of midazolam achieved by the IV route were considerably higher than those achieved by the IM route. It is concluded that midazolam is effective in the control of tonic-clonic manifestations of generalized seizures when administered by the IV or the IM route and that no correlation exists between serum levels achieved and the time to control the seizure.", 
    "68": "The purpose of the present studies was to determine whether autoinhibition of acetylcholine release could be demonstrated in vitro from mucosal/submucosal neurons in rat antrum. Rat antral mucosal/submucosal tissues preloaded with [3H]choline were perifused and [3H]acetylcholine release measured under basal and stimulated conditions. Carbachol inhibited both spontaneous and evoked (electrical field stimulation, KCl) acetylcholine release from rat antral tissues: 1 x 10(-5) M carbachol inhibited basal [3H]ACh release maximally to -38.2 +/- 3.1% (P < 0.001 vs control). The nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine enhanced both basal and stimulated acetylcholine release and abolished carbachol-induced inhibition of acetylcholine release. Pirenzepine, a muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, inhibited acetylcholine release and did not alter carbachol-induced inhibition of acetylcholine release. In conclusion, acetylcholine release from rat antral mucosal/submucosal neurons is regulated negatively by a presynaptic feedback mechanism involving M2 and/or M3 receptors, while presynaptic M1 receptors facilitate release of neurotransmitter.", 
    "69": "Kinetics of binding of [3H]PK11195, an antagonist ligand with high selectivity for the peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR), was studied in homogenates of cerebral cortex, kidney, heart, and testis of portacaval shunted rats and sham-operated controls. Portacaval anastomosis resulted in a significant two- to threefold increase in the number of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in cerebral cortex and kidney. A reduction in the number of [3H]PK11195 binding sites was observed in testis preparations, while the number of binding sites in the heart remained unaltered. These differences in the response of PTBRs to portacaval anastomosis, in different organs suggest that the physiological function of these receptors and the factors regulating them are modulated by distinct mechanisms. The finding of increased densities of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in brain and kidney following portacaval anastomosis parallels the cellular hypertrophy in these tissues and, together with previous observations of similar increases of these binding sites in brain and kidney in congenital hyperammonemia, suggest a pathophysiologic role for ammonia in these changes. In contrast, the significant loss of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in testicular preparations following portacaval anastomosis together with the known effects of steroid hormones on these sites suggests a role for PTBRs in the pathogenesis of testicular atrophy in chronic liver disease.", 
    "70": "Using PK 11195, a high affinity ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBZr), binding sites in isolated mitochondrial (m-fraction) and microsomal fractions (p-fraction) from R-3327 Dunning AT-1 tumors, ventral and dorsolateral prostate were studied. Binding of PK 11195 in both m- and p-fractions from AT-1 tumors, but only in m-fraction from ventral and dorsolateral prostate, was specific, saturable, and of high affinity. The PBZr density in m-fraction from AT-1 tumor was 6-fold and 20-fold higher than that in ventral and dorsolateral prostate, respectively. The receptor density in p-fraction from AT-1 tumors was approximately 25% of that found in the m-fraction. Clear differences were observed in the competition by both diazepam and flunitrazepam for binding sites in m- and p-fractions from tumors. These data indicate that the receptors were not only localized to the mitochondria, but were also present in considerable amounts in the microsomal fractions. The unusually high amounts of receptors in the fast growing anaplastic prostatic tumor suggest their involvement in the regulation of cell proliferation and possibly in tumorigenesis.", 
    "71": "Although vagal cholinergic stimulation is the predominant regulatory mechanism governing the release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP), recent studies suggest that cholecystokinin (CCK) is also an important mediator. The present study examined the role of cholinergic neural pathways in the PP response to exogenous CCK-8 using a selectively denervated canine pancreas model. Chronic denervated pancreatic preparations were created in five dogs, while five dogs underwent sham laparotomy as controls. On study days, the fasted animals were infused intravenous CCK-8 (40 or 400 pmole/kg/hr) for 60 min both with and without atropine (20 micrograms/kg/hr). Plasma was collected at 20-min intervals and PP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. CCK-8 elicited a dose-dependent increase in circulating PP in dogs with a neurally intact pancreas. Atropine and pancreatic denervation eliminated the PP response to CCK-8 at 40 pmole/kg/hr (P < 0.01) and inhibited the PP response to CCK-8 at 400 pmole/kg/hr (P < 0.05). The high dose of CCK-8 still elicited a small PP response in the denervated dogs (P < 0.05), which was subsequently abolished by the addition of atropine. These findings suggest that extrapancreatic cholinergic nerves are essential components of CCK-stimulated PP release, and that intrapancreatic cholinergic activity may play a limited role.", 
    "72": "The role of gastrin in the control of growth of renal G401 cells isolated from a human nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour) was investigated. G401 cell growth was enhanced in the presence of exogenous gastrin. Addition of anti-gastrin antibodies to serum-free medium significantly inhibited the growth of G401 cells. G401 cells contained the equivalent of 4.3 pg/10(6) cells of gastrin, and serum-free medium collected over 48 hr from G401 cells contained the equivalent of 38 ng/10(6) cells of gastrin, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Growth of G401 cells was inhibited in a concentration-related way by a variety of gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists. Devazepide and proglumide were, respectively, the most and the least potent inhibitors of G401 cell growth (potency order devazepide > L-365,260 = lorglumide > loxiglumide > benzotript > proglumide). These gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists had similar growth-inhibitory activities in human colonic adenocarcinoma HCT-116 cells. Growth of HCT-116 cells was stimulated to a lesser extent, as compared with G401 cells, by exogenous gastrin, and endogenous gastrin was not detectable in HCT-116 cells. The results are consistent with a role for a gastrin-like peptide in the control of growth of a renal cell line. The data suggest that gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists warrant further investigation as therapeutic agents for the control of gastrin-responsive tumours derived from outside, as well as inside, the gastrointestinal tract, including tumours derived from the kidney.",

Studies relating to the comorbidity of late-life anxiety and depression, dementia, alcoholism, and medical illness were also reviewed.", 
    "76": "The majority of studies showed that anxiety disorders are less common in the elderly than in younger adults. Generalized anxiety disorder and phobias account for most anxiety in late life; panic disorder is rare. Agoraphobia, and possibly obsessive-compulsive disorder in females, may occur as a primary disorder for the first time in old age, whereas simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder in males, and panic disorder either persist from younger years or arise in the context of another psychiatric or medical disorder. There is considerable comorbidity of geriatric depression and generalized anxiety disorder and phobias, although the depression usually goes untreated or is inappropriately treated with benzodiazepines. The rate of comorbidity of anxiety and medical illness and alcoholism is lower in the elderly than in younger persons.",

    "78": "Pain and anxiety are to be expected in patients undergoing interventional procedures, and they are usually treated by IV conscious sedation. Insufficient treatment of pain and anxiety can cause cardiovascular strain and restlessness, which may jeopardize the success of the procedure. On the other hand, pharmacologic oversedation can provoke respiratory and cardiovascular depression, thereby increasing the procedural risks and delaying the patient's recovery. We therefore evaluated a nonpharmacologic method, which we call anodyne imagery (anodyne: able to soothe or relieve pain; soothing the feelings; relaxing), as an alternative to the use of drugs in interventional radiology.", 
    "79": "Anodyne imagery technique consists of conditioned relaxation, induction of a trance state, and guided processing of the patient's internal imagery. An intrapatient comparison of drug use was made in five patients who had equivalent procedures with and without anodyne imagery and an intergroup comparison was made between a group of 16 other patients undergoing anodyne imagery and a group of 16 control patients matched for factors affecting use of drugs and recruited from 100 interventional cases analyzed for patterns of drug use. For statistical analysis, drug unit scores (weighting: 1 mg of midazolam = 1 unit and 50 micrograms of fentanyl = 1 unit) were compared within patients by paired t-test and between groups of patients by analysis of variance in two-sided tests, with p less than .05 considered to be significant.", 
    "80": "The 100 patients who did not have anodyne imagery received 0-6 mg of midazolam (median, 1.4 mg), 0-500 micrograms of fentanyl (median, 80 micrograms), and 0.5-9 drug units (median, 2.5). Drug administration was insignificantly affected by the physician conducting the procedure, the type of procedure, or the patient's age, but significantly increased with longer table times. Ten of the 21 patients undergoing anodyne imagery associated fear-provoking images with their interventional procedure that were generally intense, vivid, and dramatic. Intrapatient comparison showed significantly lower median drug use with anodyne imagery than without (0.1 vs 5.3 drug units, p = .01). Intergroup comparison also yielded significantly lower median drug use during procedures with anodyne imagery than without (0.2 vs 2.6 drug units, p = .0001).", 
    "81": "Patients having interventional radiologic procedures frequently experience intense and frightening imagery related to the procedure. Our initial experience with anodyne imagery suggests that this alternative method of analgesia can mitigate patients' anxiety and fears and reduce the amount of drugs used during interventional radiologic procedures, and thereby has the potential to improve procedural safety and increase the speed of recovery.", 
    "82": "In vivo benzodiazepine receptor equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, and maximum number of binding sites, Bmax, were measured by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in three baboons. Animals were injected with a bolus followed by a constant i.v. infusion of the high affinity benzodiazepine ligand [123I]iomazenil. Plasma steady-state concentration and receptor-ligand equilibrium were reached within 2 and 3 h, respectively, and were sustained for the duration (4-9 h) of the experiments (n = 15). At the end of the experiments, a receptor saturating dose of flumazenil (0.2 mg/kg) was injected to measure nondisplaceable activity. Experiments were carried out at various levels of specific activity, and Scatchard analysis was performed for derivation of the KD (0.59 +/- 0.09 nM) and Bmax (from 126 nM in the occipital region to 68 nM in the striatum). Two animals were killed and [125I]iomazenil Bmax and KD were measured at 22 and 37 degrees C on occipital homogenate membranes. In vitro values of Bmax (114 +/- 33 nM) and 37 degrees C KD (0.66 +/- 0.16 nM) were in good agreement with in vivo values measured by SPECT. This study demonstrates that SPECT can be used to quantify central neuroreceptors density and affinity.", 
    "83": "The aim of this work was to study the feasibility and reproducibility of in vivo measurement of benzodiazepine receptors with single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in the baboon brain. Arterial and brain regional activities were measured for 420 min in three baboons after single bolus injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist [123I]iomazenil. Data were fit to a three-compartment model to derive the regional binding potential (BP), which corresponds to the product of the receptor density, (Bmax) and affinity (1/KD). Regional BP values (from 114 in striatum to 241 in occipital) were in good agreement with values predicted from in vitro studies. Constraining the regional volume of distribution of the nondisplaceable compartment to the value measured during tracer constant infusion experiments in baboons (Laruelle et al., 1993) improved the identifiability of the rate constants. Each experiment was repeated to investigate the reproducibility of the measurement. The regional average reproducibility was 10 +/- 5%, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). Results of equilibrium analysis at peak uptake were in good agreement with results of kinetic analysis. Empirical counts ratio methods were found to be poorly sensitive to benzodiazepine receptor density. These studies suggest the feasibility of quantitative measurement of benzodiazepine receptors by kinetic analysis of SPECT data and the inadequacy of empirical methods of analysis, such as counts ratios, to evaluate differences in receptor density.", 
    "84": "We determined the direct effects of thiopental, ketamine, midazolam, etomidate, and propofol on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), the relationship of the direct effects to the baseline PVR, and the possible interaction with functional endothelium. The intravenous anesthetics were injected randomly into 1) endothelium-intact isolated rat lungs which were either unconstricted or constricted with angiotensin II (n = 10), and 2) lungs with endothelial injury produced by electrolysis (n = 10). In endothelium-intact lungs thiopental (0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) and etomidate (3.0 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.05) increased PVR by 3% +/- 1%, 30% +/- 7%, and 29% +/- 5%, respectively. Ketamine (3.0 and 100 mg/kg) and propofol (20 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the PVR by 6% +/- 1%, 15% +/- 1%, and 8% +/- 1%, respectively. Midazolam (0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg) and smaller doses of etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) and propofol (2.0 mg/kg) did not affect PVR. These responses did not vary with the baseline PVR over a twofold range. The effects of thiopental, ketamine, etomidate, and midazolam were not altered by endothelial injury. In contrast to the vasodilation produced by propofol in normal lungs, propofol (20 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.05) increased the PVR by 8% +/- 2% after endothelial injury. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that thiopental and etomidate are direct pulmonary vasoconstrictors, ketamine and propofol are direct pulmonary vasodilators, and midazolam has no direct effects in the isolated rat lung. Further, these effects on pulmonary vasculature do not vary with baseline PVR, and only propofol appears to have endothelium-dependent effects.", 
    "85": "Carbon dioxide reactivity, as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, was determined during total intravenous anesthesia with propofol or midazolam in comparison with an awake control group. Thirty ASA physical status I neurosurgical patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy participated in the study. In randomized order they were subjected to a CO2 reactivity challenge, either under an intravenous anesthesia technique or in the awake state. CO2 reactivity was calculated in each study group as a relative change in middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow velocity per mm Hg change in end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) (%/mm Hg). The cerebrovascular response to changes in CO2 was preserved during intravenous anesthesia. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the reactivity slopes between the awake and the anesthetized patients with a small but not significant difference between the propofol and the midazolam group. We conclude that hypocarbia is effective in reducing cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) during intravenous anesthesia, either with propofol or midazolam.", 
    "86": "A maximum efficiency of myocardial oxygen utilization is desirable, especially in patients with limited coronary blood supply. Little is known about the effects of anesthesia on the efficiency of myocardial oxygen utilization. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the effects of different types of anesthesia on myocardial efficiency in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Myocardial blood flow (Argon wash in technique), myocardial oxygen uptake, and standard hemodynamics were measured awake, after induction of anesthesia, and during sternal spread. Myocardial oxygen utilization efficiency was calculated from the ratio of external work divided by myocardial oxygen consumption. Sixty-five patients in eight groups with different anesthetic techniques were studied: 1) halothane/nitrous oxide, 2) enflurane/nitrous oxide, 3) high-dose morphine, 4) high-dose fentanyl, 5) fentanyl/midazolam, 6) high-dose sufentanil, 7) sufentanil/nitrous oxide, and 8) propofol. In all groups induction of anesthesia was associated with a decrease of cardiac work (from 86 +/- 17 to 55 +/- 16 J/min in pooled data) which resulted from a decrease of both stroke volume index and blood pressure. However, myocardial oxygen consumption did not decrease proportionally (from 11.2 +/- 3.0 to 8.5 +/- 2.3 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1 in pooled data) and myocardial oxygen utilization efficiency was therefore decreased in all groups (from 29.2% +/- 2.5% at awake state to 23.9% +/- 5.8% after induction of anesthesia in pooled data). Surgical stimulation by sternotomy and sternal spread was associated with different patterns of hemodynamic response between groups. Blood pressures and external work tended to be higher in the high-dose narcotic groups while it remained less affected in the other groups. However, myocardial efficiency remained depressed in all groups (22.2% +/- 8.2% in pooled data) and with respect to myocardial efficiency no differences between anesthetic techniques were found. We conclude that the specific anesthetic technique does not influence impairment of myocardial oxygen utilization efficiency by anesthesia.", 
    "87": "The developmental properties of primary rat cerebellar granule cells have been characterised with respect to their expression of GABAA receptor subtypes using both an immunological approach and radioligand binding assays. At day 1 in culture, the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit was detectable in immunoblots and increased in level up to day 9. The GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit was not detectable at day 1; however, at days 3-5, a specific M(r) 58,000 anti-alpha 6 1-16 Cys immunoreactive species was present which further increased in level up to 9 days in culture. Similar qualitative results were obtained for the expression of the GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit in age-matched rat cerebellar membranes. In parallel studies, it was found that although there was an overall increase in [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites with days in culture, the relative contributions of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding changed. A time-dependent enrichment of the diazepam-insensitive binding site up to a maximum of 74% of total [3H]Ro 15-4513 sites was found. This was concomitant with the appearance of the GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit. These results are in agreement with the pharmacology described for alpha 6 beta gamma 2 cloned receptors. They suggest a developmentally regulated expression of the GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit gene at a time that is correlated in vivo with establishment of neuronal connections.", 
    "88": "An analogue of colchicine, beta-lumicolchicine, does not bind tubulin or disrupt microtubules. However, this compound is not pharmacologically completely inactive. beta-Lumicolchicine was found to competitively inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding and to enhance muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in mouse cerebral cortical microsacs. It also markedly potentiated GABA responses in Xenopus oocytes expressing human alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S, but not alpha 1 beta 2, GABAA receptor subunits; this potentiation was reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. These results strongly suggest a direct effect of beta-lumicolchicine on the GABAA receptor/chloride channel complex and caution that it possesses pharmacological effects, despite its inability to disrupt microtubules. Furthermore, beta-lumicolchicine is structurally unrelated to benzodiazepines or quinolines and may provide a novel approach to the synthesis of ligands for this receptor.", 
    "89": "The role of muscarinic (M)-receptor subtypes in the regulation of vascular tone has not yet been defined in humans. To analyze the role of M-receptor subtypes in the forearm resistance vasculature of normotensive volunteers (n = 20), we infused acetylcholine (ACh) and methacholine (MCh) in the presence of saline and the antagonists atropine (nonselective), pirenzepine (M1 selective), and AF-DX 116 (M2 selective), using automated R-wave-triggered venous occlusion plethysmography. Schild analysis was applied by calculating plasma concentrations of the infused compounds and determining EC50 values. ACh and MCh both caused dose-dependent vasodilation, with EC50 values of 537 and 52 nmol/L, respectively. The apparent 10-fold higher potency of MCh compared with ACh may be explained by rapid degradation of ACh in plasma. The concentration-response curve of MCh was shifted to the right by atropine, pirenzepine, and AF-DX 116, with apparent pA2 values of 8.03 +/- 0.03, 6.71 +/- 0.08, and 5.32 +/- 0.05, respectively, and slopes not different from unity. The present technique enabled us to perform M-receptor characterization by Schild analysis in humans. The affinity constants and rank order of potency--atropine > pirenzepine > AF-DX 116-suggest that cholinergic vasodilation in this vascular bed is predominantly mediated by the M3-receptor subtype. The EC50 value of MCh and the pA2 values of pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 are comparable to values reported for in vitro experiments.", 
    "90": "Midazolam is a new short-acting benzodiazepine which is more potent than diazepam. Reports on its use in young pediatric dental patients is lacking in the literature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sedative qualities of midazolam via the oral and nasal routes in 100 recalcitrant pediatric dental patients between 1.5 and 6 years of age. One half of the patients received oral midazolam at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg administered with 25 mg hydroxyzine pamoate suspension as a vehicle. The other half received nasal midazolam at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation and local anesthesia were used in all cases. The results indicated that a satisfactory level of sedation was achieved in approximately two thirds of the cases. Complications were rare, and not of clinical significance. There was no significant difference in the frequency of success or complications reported between the oral and nasal routes. The results of the present study support the need for future investigations to determine optimal pediatric dosages and regimens for each route.", 
    "91": "Optimizing the safety and the efficacy of a treatment course has been a persistent goal of ECT practice since its introduction sixty years ago. Muscle relaxants, barbiturate anesthesia, and oxygenation were developed to reduce the risks of fracture, fear, and cognitive deficits. Unilateral electrode placement elicited fewer cognitive complaints and was reported as clinically effective as bilateral placement. Seizure duration monitoring, first by cuff and then by EEG, was introduced to define \"an effective seizure\". Caffeine pre-treatment lengthened seizure durations. Brief pulse square wave currents replaced sinusoidal currents to reduce cognitive effects. Twice weekly treatments were shown to be as effective as three treatments weekly, although the latter was more rapidly effective. Continuation ECT became a feature of practice. The safety and efficacy of psychoactive drugs combined with ECT were clarified so that antipsychotic drugs now are generally continued; benzodiazepines, lithium, and anticonvulsants are withdrawn; and the continuation of antidepressant drugs is optional. In recent studies, the minimal energy needed to elicit a seizure was determined and energy dosing is suggested as 2.5 times [or other multiple] of the threshold. Others find that age or half-age dosing methods are satisfactory and with less risk to patients. The definition of an \"effective seizure\" as one that is 25 seconds or longer in motor convulsive activity is questioned and EEG criteria are examined as substitutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "92": "One hundred and sixteen samples for toxicological analysis (78 urines and 38 stomach contents) were analysed both with the Bio-Rad REMEDi Drug Profiling System and with a set of immunoassays and standard chromatographic procedures (HPLC, GC/NPD and GC/MS). As a screening method, REMEDi performed only moderately well, compared with immunoassays. Amphetamines and tricyclic antidepressants were detected by REMEDi in 80% and 68%, respectively, of the positive immunoassay results. Positive immunoassay screening tests were more often confirmed by the conventional chromatographic methods (80%) than by REMEDi (35%). The highest confirmation score for REMEDi was observed in the amphetamine group (9 of 12), while low scores were obtained for barbiturates (1 of 7) and benzodiazepines (13 of 75). However, in these samples REMEDi detected 53 additional compounds, which were neither reactive in the immunoassay screening tests, nor detected by the standard chromatographic procedures. These results clearly demonstrate that REMEDi can be a useful complementary technique in the clinical toxicology laboratory, since it expands the range of drugs covered by the immunoassays and provides a rapid, preliminary report in emergency situations.", 
    "93": "The development of the GABAA/Benzodiazepine receptor (GABAAR) in the red nucleus was studied using 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZ) as the probe. Saturation binding assay showed that the Bmax of the ligand to the membranes of the nucleus increased from 0.50 +/- 0.04 nmol/mg protein at postnatal day 4, to 0.71 +/- 0.1 and 0.78 +/- 0.08 at day 7 and day 10. At day 20 the Bmax decreased to a level near day 4 and persisted until day 40. However, the affinity of 3H-FNZ to the receptor remained quite constant. At least 4 proteins of 51kD, 53kD, 59kD and 62kD in the nucleus were labeled by 3H-FNZ, as revealed from photoaffinity binding and SDS-PAGE. The labeling of 53kD, 59kD and 62kD was high at earlier ages than day 10, whereas the 51kD was predominent from day 10 to day 40. Receptor binding autoradiography of the nucleus also showed that the most dense labeling was seen around day 10. The early transient increase in the GABAAR of the red nucleus may indicate the plasticity of the nucleus in response to environmental changes after birth.", 
    "94": "Steroid biosynthesis activated by pituitary tropic hormones is known to be acutely regulated by cAMP acting via Protein kinase A. Because the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) has been suggested to play a role in the activation of steroidogenesis, the present study investigates whether various protein kinases phosphorylate MBR. In rat and bovine adrenal mitochondrial preparations Protein kinase A, but not other purified protein kinases, was found to phosphorylate the 18 kDa MBR protein. In digitonin-permeabilized MA-10 Leydig tumor cells incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, phosphorylation of MBR was detectable during treatment of the cells with dibutyryl cAMP. In conclusion, these data show that the MBR protein is an in vitro and in situ substrate of Protein kinase A, but the role of this phosphorylation in the regulation of steroidogenesis remains to be established.", 
    "95": "Title compounds 1-36 were synthesized by reacting hydrazine with aldol adducts obtained from ninhydrin and methyl or alpha methylene ketones and aldehydes. Some of them showed a low, but significant benzodiazepine receptor affinity whose variation was interpreted through a structure-activity relationships study based on qualitative correlations and Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA). Some indeno-pyridazine derivatives were found to possess an interesting anticonvulsant activity which however does not seem simply related to the benzodiazepine receptor modulation.", 
    "96": "Combination of fibrocavernous pulmonary tuberculosis and malignant gastric tumor is very rare. Anesthesia in such patients is associated with a number of difficulties. Balanced regional anesthesia based on epidural blockade and intravenous diazepam and fentanyl is recommended as a method of choice. An example of a successful clinical application of this type of anesthesia is given.", 
    "97": "The response of central cholinergic neurotransmission to the chronic administration of some psychotropic drugs to rats was investigated using brain acetylcholinesterase activity as a neurochemical marker for cholinergic neurons. Rats were divided into four groups. Three experimental groups were given chlorpromazine, amitriptyline, or diazepam respectively, for a period of 30 days; and the control group received physiological saline only. Long-term treatment of chlorpromazine and amitriptyline resulted in significant increases in rat brain cortex enzyme activity, whereas only a slight increase was observed in the diazepam-treated group. These results indicate that the chronic treatment with some psychotropic drugs causes changes in central cholinergic transmission.", 
    "98": "All suicides in Switzerland in 1990 where drugs were involved (179 persons; 12.2% of all suicides) were analyzed by examination of death certificates and direct contacts with physicians and medico-legal institutions. Nearly 50% of these people took overdoses of combinations of different drugs and in 26% of the cases alcohol was reported to have been taken with the drugs. Unexpectedly, we found 29 suicides in which persons had obviously used drug combinations recommended by EXIT, an organization advocating the freedom of the individual to decide about his own time and nature of death. In EXIT-suicides usually barbiturates and anticholinergic drugs were taken together. Interestingly, the barbiturate compound used most often had officially been withdrawn from the market the previous year. Altogether, psychotropic drugs represented 78.7% of all drugs taken, with benzodiazepines being named most often (38.9%), followed by barbiturates (16.6%) and antidepressants (13.6%). Among the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam, diazepam, and triazolam were used most often and surprisingly, benzodiazepines were named as single drugs on 27 death certificates. Among the antidepressants (taken in 20.3% of overdoses) maprotiline was the most common drug used, followed by mianserin and trimipramine. This order of frequency reflects the prescribing habits of Swiss doctors. Two suicides were recorded with neuroleptics alone.", 
    "99": "Maxillary regions of day-12.5 ICR mouse fetuses were dissected and cultured in a chemically defined serumless medium, and the effects of anticonvulsant drugs on in vitro palatogenesis were studied. The explants were treated for 72 h in vitro with 50 to 200 micrograms/mL diphenylhydantoin (DPH), 200 to 800 micrograms/mL sodium phenobarbital (PB), 12.5 to 400 micrograms/mL sodium valproate (VPA), and 3 to 100 micrograms/mL diazepam (DAZ). During the culture, the secondary palatal shelves of control explants elevated, grew medially, and fused after 72-h culture in a manner similar to the palatogenetic process in vivo. The fusion of palatal shelves was inhibited dose-dependently by treatments with DPH, VPA, and DAZ. PB showed no significant inhibitory effects on palatal fusion at concentrations up to 800 micrograms/mL. The in vitro toxicity of the anticonvulsants tested appeared to correlate with the relative in vivo teratogenic potential of the drugs. The present study demonstrated that the in vitro organ culture system should be useful for screening teratogenic agents, especially those causing cleft palate, and for exploring the mechanisms of cleft palate formation.", 
    "100": "The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for the treatment of patients with panic disorder who experience an incomplete response to a trial of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "101": "Fifteen consecutive patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of panic disorder referred for further treatment because of an incomplete response to pharmacotherapy were treated with 12-weeks of group cognitive behavior therapy. Patients were evaluated at baseline, endpoint, and at a mean of 2-months' follow-up to assess changes in panic attack frequency and global outcome. Eight of the 15 patients were deemed to have received an inadequate prior trial of medication at baseline, mainly because of a desire to control their symptoms without medication or fear of withdrawal and/or addiction. Seven of the patients were symptomatic at baseline despite an adequate prior trial of medication.", 
    "102": "Overall, patients experienced a significant improvement in global function at the end of the cognitive behavior therapy intervention, as well as a decrease in panic attack frequency. Improvement was maintained at follow-up.", 
    "103": "This study is consistent with a growing body of evidence that many patients with panic disorder remain symptomatic over time and are receiving inadequate pharmacotherapeutic treatment. Further, we observed that patients with panic disorder who are incompletely responsive or resistant to pharmacotherapeutic management may benefit from the addition of cognitive behavior therapy.", 
    "104": "Zolpidem is a short-acting, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic with rapid onset of action. Even though it is not a benzodiazepine, it binds to one of three types of central benzodiazepine receptors, showing selective binding to the type 1 benzodiazepine receptor subtype. Therapeutic hypnotic dosages do not disturb normal sleep patterns (sleep architecture).", 
    "105": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group multicenter trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of 10 mg and 15 mg of zolpidem in the long-term (35 nights) treatment of chronic insomnia in 75 patients. Sleep stage effects and motor and cognitive effects during the 35-night treatment period and the 3-night posttreatment period were also investigated.", 
    "106": "Within the first week of treatment, 10 mg of zolpidem had a significant effect on latency to persistent sleep and sleep efficiency. Efficacy was maintained throughout the 35 nights of drug administration. There was no evidence of residual effect with 10 mg of zolpidem. Stage 3-4 sleep was preserved at both the 10-mg and 15-mg zolpidem dosages. There was no evidence of tolerance at either dose and no significant treatment differences between the 10-mg zolpidem group and placebo in latency to persistent sleep or sleep efficiency during the posttreatment period. Also, the 10-mg zolpidem dosage was judged by the patients to have helped them fall asleep. Similar results were observed with the 15-mg zolpidem dosage. However, there were significant decreases in REM sleep at Weeks 3 and 4 with 15 mg of zolpidem compared with placebo. Overall, incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events in the zolpidem groups were similar to those in the placebo group.", 
    "107": "This is the first sleep laboratory study using a parallel placebo group to demonstrate efficacy for longer than 4 weeks with a hypnotic agent. In this study 10 mg of zolpidem was found to be safe and effective for the long-term treatment of chronic insomnia, demonstrating hypnotic efficacy without affecting sleep stages or producing tolerance effects, rebound effects, or detrimental effects on psychomotor performance. The 15-mg zolpidem dosage provided no clinical advantage over the 10-mg zolpidem dosage.", 
    "108": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam and N-demethyladinazolam (NDMAD) were evaluated in twelve healthy non-smokers (NS) and twelve smokers (S, > or = 20 cigarettes/day) following a single 60 mg dose of adinazolam mesylate sustained-release tablets in an open-label, parallel-group design. Venous blood samples were collected for up to 36 h following drug administration and assayed for adinazolam and NDMAD by HPLC. Urine samples were also collected and assayed for NDMAD by HPLC. Psychomotor performance was measured using the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System. No significant differences were observed in adinazolam oral clearance (51.8 +/- 25.8 versus 48.2 +/- 14.01 h-1) or peak adinazolam plasma concentrations (Cmax) (93.3 +/- 31.8 versus 90.4 +/- 18.0 ng ml-1) between groups. NDMAD AUC (2541 +/- 457 versus 2798 +/- 447 ng h ml-1) and Cmax (173 +/- 30.3 versus 175 +/- 26.9 ng ml-1) did not differ significantly between groups. NDMAD renal clearance was significantly lower in smokers than non-smokers (8.7 +/- 0.7 versus 10.7 +/- 2.71 h-1; p < 0.05), but the clinical significance of this observation is unclear. Marginally significant differences were seen between groups in the symbol-digit substitution and digit span (forward) tasks. The results suggest that smoking has little effect on adinazolam and NDMAD pharmacokinetics or psychomotor effects but that smoking may slightly decrease renal clearance of NDMAD."
