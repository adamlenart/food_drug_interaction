    "0": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18 kDa protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane that interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel and may participate in formation of the permeability transition pore. The physiological role of PBR is reflected in the high-affinity binding of endogenous ligands that are metabolites of both cholesterol and heme. Certain porphyrin precursors of heme can be photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT), which depends on visible light activation of porphyrin-related macrocycles. Because the apparent binding affinity of a series of porphyrin analogs for PBR paralleled their ability to photoinactivate cells, PBR has been proposed as the molecular target for porphyrin-derived photocytotoxicity. The phthalocyanine (Pc) photosensitizer Pc 4 accumulates in mitochondria and structurally resembles porphyrins. Therefore, we tested the relevance of PBR binding on Pc 4-PDT. Binding affinity was measured by competition with 3H-PK11195, a high-affinity ligand of PBR, for binding to rat kidney mitochondria (RKM) or intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To assess the binding of the Pc directly, we synthesized 14C-labeled Pc 4 and found that whereas Pc 4 was a competitive inhibitor of 3H-PK11195 binding to the PBR, PK11195 did not inhibit the binding of 14C-Pc 4 to RKM. Further, 14C-Pc 4 binding to RKM showed no evidence of saturation up to 10 microM. Finally, when Pc 4-loaded CHO cells were exposed to activating red light, apoptosis was induced; Pc 4-PDT was less effective in causing apoptosis in a companion cell line overexpressing the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. For both cell lines, PK11195 inhibited PDT-induced apoptosis; however, the inhibition was transient and did not extend to overall cell death, as determined by clonogenic assay. The results demonstrate (1) the presence of low-affinity binding sites for Pc 4 on PBR; (2) the presence of multiple binding sites for Pc 4 in RKM and CHO cells other than those that influence PK11195 binding; and (3) the ability of high supersaturating levels of PK11195 to transiently inhibit apoptosis initiated by Pc 4-PDT, with less influence on overall cell killing. We conclude that the binding of Pc 4 to PBR is less relevant to the photocytotoxicity of Pc 4-PDT than are other mitochondrial events, such as photodamage to Bcl-2 and that the observed inhibition of Pc 4-PDT-induced apoptosis by PK11195 likely occurs through a mechanism independent of PBR.", 
    "1": "We report a 19-year-old woman who developed refractory status epilepticus due to non-herpetic limbic encephalitis. Because ordinary anti-epileptics were ineffective, general anesthesia under mechanical ventilation was begun with pentobarbital, midazolam, and propofol. After 4 months, we could finally discontinue the intravenous anesthetics. Then, she gradually became conscious and several weeks later, could communicate verbally. Simultaneously, she began to manifest psychomotor agitation and emotional incontinence mimicking Kl\u00fcver-Bucy syndrome. Brain MRI revealed cortical atrophy in the fronto-temporal lobes and dilated anterior and inferior horns of the lateral ventricles. Dopamine blockers and benzodiazepines failed to resolve these emotional symptoms. Oral tandospirone (30 mg/day dose) was initiated and a partial regression was observed. The following administration of fluvoxamine (started with 12.5 mg/day and maintained with 75 mg/day) resulted in a dramatic improvement of her symptoms within 3 days. This clinical course suggests that impaired serotonergic neurotransmission plays a key role in her emotional disturbances and that its modulation by serotonergic agents is useful to relieve such symptoms.", 
    "2": "This investigation determined the effects of K(+) channel antagonists on proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of porcine granulosa cells. The drugs screened for functional effects included the class III antiarrhythmic agents MK-499 and clofilium, the chromanol I(Ks) antagonist 293B, the benzodiazepine I(Ks) antagonists L-735,821 and L-768,673, and the peptidyl toxins charybdotoxin (CTX) and margatoxin (MTX). Granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation were assessed by serial measurements of cell number and progesterone accumulation in the culture media, respectively. Granulosa cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry. Additional information about drug effects was obtained by immunoblotting to detect expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p27(kip1) and the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The ERG channel antagonist MK-499 had no functional effects on cultured granulosa cells. However, the broad spectrum K(+) channel antagonist clofilium decreased, in a concentration-dependent fashion, the number of viable granulosa cells cultured, and these effects were associated with induction of apoptosis. All three I(Ks) antagonists (293B, L-735,821, and L-768,673) increased basal, but not FSH-enhanced progesterone accumulation on Day 1 after treatment without affecting the number of viable cells in culture, an effect that was blocked by pimozide. In contrast, CTX and MTX increased the number of viable cells in FSH-stimulated cultures on Day 3 after treatment without affecting progesterone output per cell. These data demonstrate that selective antagonism of granulosa cell K(+) channels with distinct molecular correlates, electrophysiological properties, and expression patterns can influence differential granulosa cell proliferation, steroidogenic capability, and apoptosis. Thus, K(+) channels may represent pharmacological targets for affecting Granulosa cell function and oocyte maturation, in vivo or in vitro.", 
    "3": "A novel synthetic approach towards N1-alkylated 3-propyl-1,4-benzodiazepines was developed in five synthetic steps from 2-amino-4-chlorobenzophenone, in which the N-oxide 4 served as a key intermediate. The structure-activity relationship optimization of this 3-propyl-1,4-benzodiazepine template was carried out on the N1-position by selective alkylation reactions and resulted in a ligand with an improved affinity on the cholecystokinin (CCK2) receptor. The N-allyl-3-propyl-benzodiazepine 6d displayed an affinity towards the CCK2 (CCK-B) receptor of 170 nM in a radiolabelled receptor-binding assay. The anxiolytic activity of this allyl-3-propyl-1,4-benzodiazepine 6d was subsequently determined in in-vivo psychotropic assays. This novel ligand had ED50 values of 4.7 and 5.2 mg kg(-1) in the black and white box test and the x-maze, respectively, and no significant sedation/muscle relaxation was observed.", 
    "4": "The aim of this study was to explore the effects of diets containing saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, respectively) on the passive and active transport properties of rat jejunum using marker compounds. Rats were fed diets supplemented with 18.4% (w/w) lipid (4 groups) or standard rat chow (1 group) for a period of 30 days. At the end of the dietary period, mucosal scrapings were taken for the determination of membrane phospholipids, and the apparent jejunal permeability of radiolabelled marker compounds was determined using modified Ussing chambers. Changes in the phospholipid content of the brush border membrane reflected the different lipid content of the diets. The passive paracellular permeability of mannitol was not significantly affected by the fatty acid composition of the diet, although there was a trend toward decreased mannitol permeability in the rats fed both the omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA diets. In comparison, the transcellular diffusion of diazepam was reduced by 20% (P < 0.05) in rats fed diets supplemented with omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA. In the lipid-fed rats, the serosal to mucosal flux of digoxin, an intestinal P-glycoprotein substrate, was reduced by 20% (P < 0.05) relative to the chow-fed group, however there were no significant differences between the different lipid groups. The active absorption of D-glucose via the Na+-dependent transport pathway was highest in the SFA, MUFA and PUFA omega-3 dietary groups, intermediate in the low-fat chow group and lowest in the PUFA omega-6 group, and was positively correlated with short-circuit current. These studies indicate that dietary fatty acid changes can result in moderate changes to the active and passive transport properties of excised rat jejunum.", 
    "5": "The authors investigated the role of the cBZD/GABA-A receptor-complex in the regulation of rCBF by simultaneously applying [15O]-butanol-PET and TCD in therapy-resistant TLE patients. It is known that the density of the cBZD/GABA-A-receptors is reduced in the epileptogenic area of the temporal lobe, but there are no data available about the impact of this phenomenon on rCBF. FMZ is a well-known BZD-receptor antagonist which can be used to inhibit the effect mediated by cBZD/GABA-A-receptors, offering a way to study the contribution of these receptors in the determination of rCBF. The authors examined the possible correlation between the rCBF values obtained by PET and the blood flow speed readings measured by TCD in MCAs. The results show that FMZ does not cause any change in rCBF on the side of the epileptogenic focus but it significantly raises rCBF (p < 0.001) in the intact brain tissue on the other side. The TCD measurements showed no significant differences between the blood flow in the MCAs supplying the affected and the contralateral lobe.", 
    "6": "Systematic research is needed to evaluate the exact role of pathological factors in the determination of the extension of the hypometabolic area in partial epileptic patients. Together with structural damage, previous seizures, deafferentation and inhibitory mechanisms may contribute to the functional disorders. Benzodiazepine receptor studies showed that the density and binding ability of these receptors decreased in the area of epileptic functional disorder. Circumscribed hypermetabolism may appear during epileptic seizures or even more electrical discharges. The authors' PET studies aimed at presurgical evaluation showed that bilateral temporal hypometabolism occurred more frequently with right-sided seizure start. FDG-PET supported the localization of the pacemaker area both in temporal lobe epilepsies and in extratemporal epilepsies. This method proved instrumental in delineating the extension of the background pathology, too. The authors also demonstrated the strength of PET brain activation in mapping the hemispheric distribution of speech functions required in the planning of surgical interventions. The role of hippocampal sclerosis in temporal lobe hypometabolism was investigated and a short account is given of the observations relating to the relationship of hypermetabolism due to subclinical epileptic discharges and cognitive deficit symptoms.", 
    "7": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of oral diazepam on anal incontinence after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Five patients with persistent incontinence after low anterior resection for rectal cancer (median level of anastomosis was 4.0 cm from the anal verge) were treated with oral diazepam (2 mg/day) 9-90 months after surgery. Grade and frequency of anal incontinence, the need for a protective pad and changes of lifestyle were recorded to the Cleveland Clinic's continence grading scale; anorectal manometry was performed before and after 3 months of treatment. All patients improved on treatment although occasional minor soiling persisted in two patients. Continence score improved from 14 (median, range 9-16) to 0 (range 0-12) after taking diazepam. Improvement occurred within a week after administration of diazepam. Although the patients improved symptomatically, anorectal manometry failed to demonstrate any significant changes. In conclusion, oral administration of diazepam may be worthwhile in the attempt to improve anal continence after low anterior resection.",

    "12": "Behavioral animal paradigms and experimental neuroendocrinological and neurochemical studies have shown that early environmental manipulations have profound effects on the late response to stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the interactive effects of environmental manipulation (early handling) and experimentally induced behavioral differences on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) system, which is known to be involved in the response to stressors. Adult early-handled (EH) and nonhandled (NH; control) Wistar rats were placed in a two-way active avoidance/latent inhibition (LI) paradigm, and PBR densities in the adrenal glands, kidneys, and gonads were assessed. In line with previous studies, overall avoidance learning improved in the EH group, and LI was disrupted in the NH group (primarily in males). PBR densities were up-regulated in EH subjects, and more so in females than males. However, PBR densities did not correlate with any of the behavioral measures. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that differences in PBR densities between EH and NH rats are a reflection of trait rather than state, and they suggest that the PBR system is characterized by a highly stressor-specific response.",

    "18": "20 studies were included in the review, with 1357 people randomised. 10 studies compared methadone with adrenergic agonists, 7 studies compared different modalities of methadone detoxification, 2 studies compared methadone with other opioid agonists, 1 study compared methadone with chlordiazepoxide one with placebo. The conclusions of the 10 studies that compared methadone with adrenergic agonists showed a substantial clinical difference of the two treatments in terms of retention in treatment, degree of discomfort and detoxification success rates. The conclusions of the 6 studies that compare different methadone reduction schedules, showed that different types of methadone withdrawal schedule produce different responses in terms of time course of withdrawal, the severity of withdrawal response and possibly in terms of subsequent engagement with treatment. Regarding the studies that compare methadone with other opioid agonists, in Sorensen 1982 methadyl acetate performed similarly to methadone on most process and outcome measures, while in Tennant 1975, methadone reduced severity of withdrawal and had fewer drop-outs than did a propoxyphene group. In Drummond 1989, using chlordiazepoxide vs methadone, the results suggest that the two drugs had similar results in terms of overall effectiveness. San 1992 compared methadone with placebo and found more severe withdrawal and more drop outs in the placebo group. The results indicate that tapered methadone and other medications used in the included studies are effective in the treatment of the heroin withdrawal syndrome, although symptoms experienced by subjects differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. It seems that regardless of which medication is selected for heroin detoxification, the rates of subsequent heroin abstinence are about equal. This suggests that the medications are similar in terms of overall effectiveness. Improvements were achieved when other services such as counseling and other supporting services were offered contemporaneously with detoxification.",

Results of many outcomes could not be summarised because they were presented either in graphical form or provided only statistical tests and p-values. For most studies standard deviation for continuous variables were not provided. The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long acting opioids, accompanied by medical supervision and ancillary medications can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. However this cannot be considered a goal for a detoxification as heroin dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder and the goal of detoxification should be to remove or reduce dependence on heroin in a controlled and human fashion and not a treatment for heroin dependence.",

The patient had previously been treated with lithium, risperidone, fluoxetine and lorazepam, and successfully titrated to lithium levels of 0.7 mmol/l. After overdosing, the lithium level was 5.89 mmol/l and haemodialysis was initiated. A full pharmacokinetic time profile of lithium was obtained. After successful haemodialysis treatment, lithium levels recovered below toxic levels of 1.5 mmol/l in 53 hr. Without intervention non-toxic levels were not expected to have been reached within 6 days, based on computer simulation of predialysis levels. The patient was discharged 6 days after admission without residual symptoms. It was concluded that the lithium intoxication resulted from a combination of lithium overdose and subsequent renal insufficiency due to the overdose. A possible fluoxetine-risperidone interaction was not considered clinically apparent.",

Clinical function was assessed at baseline and 6 months using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Of the remaining 111 patients, 70 changed payors (ie, qualified for Medicaid), and 41 were lost to follow-up. In the subgroup analysis, patients who completed 12 months of treatment (ie, responders) had significantly lower mean PANSS total scores at baseline compared with those who changed payors or were lost to follow-up (P = 0.047), and were significantly more likely to have a formal diagnosis of thought disorder (P = 0.039). Responders demonstrated a significant reduction in PANSS total and negative subscale scores at 6-month follow-up (both measures, P < 0.001). In the intent-to-treat analysis of resource utilization in all patients with complete data sets (n = 78), hospitalization costs and crisis costs decreased significantly during the 12-month follow-up period (P = 0.003 and P = 0.009, respectively), and both outpatient and medication costs increased significantly (P = 0.035 and P < 0.001, respectively).

Patients all met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of delirium and were rated systematically with the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) as a measure of delirium severity, phenomenology, and resolution, over the course of a 7-day treatment period. Sociodemographic and medical variables and measures of physical performance status and drug-related side effects were collected. Fifty-seven patients (76%) had complete resolution of their delirium on olanzapine therapy. No patients experienced extrapyramidal side effects; however, 30% experienced sedation (usually not severe enough to interrupt treatment). Several factors were found to be significantly associated with poorer response to olanzapine treatment for delirium, including age >70 years, history of dementia, central nervous system spread of cancer and hypoxia as delirium etiologies, \"hypoactive\" delirium, and delirium of \"severe\" intensity (i.e., MDAS >23). A logistic-regression model suggests that age >70 years is the most powerful predictor of poorer response to olanzapine treatment for delirium (odds ratio, 171.5).

It is generally characterized by acute disturbances of consciousness, cognition, and perception that are precipitated by an underlying medical condition. The gold standard of psychiatric treatment is to treat the underlying medical cause and use high-potency antipsychotics to treat the clinical manifestations of delirium. In the early 1990s, a new generation of novel antipsychotics was developed. Their mechanism of action, preferential serotonergic (5HT(2a)) blockade, results in a markedly lower rate of extrapyramidal side effects, an advantage over the typical, older antipsychotic medications. These agents have been shown to be effective and well tolerated in common psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), but few studies have evaluated them in the treatment of delirium.

In addition to daily sleep diaries and sleep laboratory measures, the participants completed the dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep scale (DBAS) at baseline and posttreatment, and at 3-, 12- and 24-month follow-up assessments. The results showed that CBT and COMB treatments produced greater improvements of beliefs and attitudes about sleep at posttreatment than PCT and PLA. Reductions of DBAS scores were significantly correlated with improvements of sleep efficiency as measured by daily sleep diaries and by polysomnography. In addition, more adaptive beliefs and attitudes about sleep at posttreatment were associated with better maintenance of sleep improvements at follow-ups. These findings highlight the importance of targeting sleep-related beliefs and attitudes in the treatment of insomnia.",

    "44": "Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Because A beta is produced from the processing of amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases, these enzymes are considered important therapeutic targets for identification of drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease. Unlike beta-secretase, which is a monomeric aspartyl protease, gamma-secretase activity resides as part of a membrane-bound, high molecular weight, macromolecular complex. Pepstatin and L685458 are among several structural classes of gamma-secretase inhibitors identified so far. These compounds possess a hydroxyethylene dipeptide isostere of aspartyl protease transition state analogs, suggesting gamma-secretase may be an aspartyl protease. However, the mechanism of inhibition of gamma-secretase by pepstatin and L685458 has not been elucidated. In this study, we report that pepstatin A methylester and L685458 unexpectedly displayed linear non-competitive inhibition of gamma-secretase. Sulfonamides and benzodiazepines, which do not resemble transition state analogs of aspartyl proteases, also displayed potent, non-competitive inhibition of gamma-secretase. Models to rationalize how transition state analogs inhibit their targets by non-competitive inhibition are discussed.", 
    "45": "In this study, we hypothesized that many of the reported effects of phthalate esters and other peroxisome proliferators (PPs) in the testis are mediated by members of the PP- activated receptor (PPAR) family of transcription factors through alterations in proteins involved in steroidogenesis. Exposure of Leydig cells to PPs prevented cholesterol transport into the mitochondria after hormonal stimulation and inhibited steroid synthesis, without altering total cell protein synthesis or mitochondrial and DNA integrity. PPs also reduced the levels of the cholesterol-binding protein peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) because of a direct transcriptional inhibition of PBR gene expression in MA-10 Leydig cells. MA-10 cells contain mRNAs for PPARalpha and PPARbeta/delta, but not for PPARgamma. In vivo treatment of mice with PPs resulted in the reduction of both testis PBR mRNA and circulating testosterone levels, in agreement with the proposed role of PBR in steroidogenesis. By contrast, liver PBR mRNA levels were increased, in agreement with the proposed role of PBR in cell growth/tumor formation in nonsteroidogenic tissues. However, PPs did not inhibit testosterone production and testis PBR expression in PPARalpha-null mice. These results suggest that the antiandrogenic effect of PPs is mediated by a PPARalpha-dependent inhibition of Leydig cell PBR gene expression.", 
    "46": "Benzodiazepine pharmacology has led to greater insight into the neural mechanisms underlying learning and anxiety. The synthesis of new compounds capable of modulating responses produced by these receptors has been made possible by the development of an isoform model of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex. In the current experiment, rats were pretreated with several concentrations of the novel ligand RY024 (an alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 -selective benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist) in the hippocampus and were trained in a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm. RY024 independently produced fear-related behavior prior to training and, at the highest concentration, decreased the strength of conditioning observed 24 h after training. These data provide further evidence for the involvement of hippocampal GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors in learning and anxiety.", 
    "47": "The present study evaluates the usefulness of dextromethorphan N-demethylation activity indices to reflect cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity in man. Indices of dextromethorphan N-demethylation activity were categorized as N1=3-methoxymorphinan/dextromethorphan, N2=3-hydroxymorphinan/dextrorphan, N3=(3-methoxymorphinan + 3-hydroxymorphinan)/(dextromethorphan + dextrorphan). Two mg of midazolam were administered orally to 22 Japanese male volunteers, and midazolam clearance determined. Thirty mg of dextromethorphan were also orally administered to these volunteers and N1, N2 and N3 indices determined by 12 hr urine collection. Results showed N2 and N3 were highly correlated (r>0.99, P<0.001), and significantly correlated to oral midazolam clearance (r=0.45, P<0.05); suggesting that N2 and N3 are more suitable than N, when using dextromethorphan as an index of individual CYP3A activity.", 
    "48": "The GABA(A) receptor is the primary mediator of inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain and is a major target for neuromodulatory drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol and anaesthetics. However, our understanding of the molecular details of this receptor has been limited by a lack of high-resolution structural information. This article presents a new model for the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of the GABA(A) receptor, that is based on the recently determined structure of a soluble acetylcholine-binding protein. The model puts existing mutational and biochemical data into a three-dimensional context, shows details of the GABA- and benzodiazepine-binding sites, and highlights the importance of other regions in allosteric conformational change. This provides a new perspective on existing data and an exciting new framework for understanding this important family of receptors.", 
    "49": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the administration of an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist alone and in combination with other derivatives on brain wave activity. In addition, the diagnostic values of the electroencephalogram (EEG) for judging the depth of the balanced anaesthesia with an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist was evaluated. The treatments comprised 20 microg/kg medetomidine (Me-20), 80 microg/kg medetomidine (Me-80), 20 microg/kg medetomidine and 0.5 mg/kg midazolam (Me-Mi) administered intramuscularly, and 20 microg/kg medetomidine with 0.5 mg/kg midazolam and 0.1 mg/kg butorphanol (Me-Mi-Bu). The EEG was recorded continuously at pre-administration, and at 7, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min after administration. The recorded data were analysed by separating the power spectrum into 1-3, 4-7, 8-13 and 14-30 Hz bands. Spectral-edge analysis was used to calculate the spectral edge frequency 90 (SEF90) and the median edge frequency (MEF). Time-related changes in power spectrum analysis showed a significant increase in the Me-80 group in the 1-3 Hz band. The power for 1-3 Hz in the Me-80 group was significantly higher than in all the other groups. In the 14-30 Hz band, there was a significant reduction of power in all groups following administration of the agents. The SEF90 frequencies were significantly reduced in all groups except for the Me-20 group after administration of the agents. The SEF90 frequencies in the Me-20, Me-Mi and Me-Mi-Bu were all significantly higher than those in the Me-80 group. However, there was no significant difference between the Me-20, Me-Mi and Me-Mi-Bu groups in any analyses. Our results demonstrated that the changes in quantitative EEG made by the Me-Mi-Bu and Me-Mi groups were similar to those made by Me-20 groups. Present results suggest that the EEG should be interpreted with caution in assessing the anaesthetic level in balanced anaesthesia in dogs.",

Haloperidol was the most prescribed medication (15 patients - 75 %). Sulpiride, diazepam and valproate were also used as symptomatic treatment. Immune-modulating therapy with prednisone was prescribed for seven children. The shortest course of chorea (16 days) occurred in a patient treated with prednisone.",

Fifteen patients received 2 days of a washout and placebo \"run-in\" followed by two day periods on each of three doses of olanzapine (2.5 mgs, 5 mgs, and 10 mgs). Patients completed a daily food journal as well as the Mini Mental State Exam, Simpson Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General across four time periods, with special attention being placed on the nausea item. Eleven women and 4 men with varied primary cancer sites participated. The average age of the sample was 58 years (SD = 16.8). All three dose levels were associated with significant reductions in nausea compared to baseline. Diary entries recorded by the subjects suggested substantial benefits to overall well being and the 5mg condition was associated with statistically significant improvement in overall quality of life over baseline (F = 12.0, p < 0.005). No extrapyramidal symptoms were noted and mental status exams were not changed over the course of the eight days. These results suggest an antiemetic effect for olanzapine and indicate the need for a controlled trial.",

    "59": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of excipient type and level on the release of alprazolam formulated in controlled release matrix tablets containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). Each tablet formulation contained alprazolam, HPMC (Methocel K4MP), excipients, and magnesium stearate. The soluble excipients investigated were lactose monohydrate, sucrose, and dextrose, and the insoluble excipients included dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, and calcium sulfate dihydrate. The similarity factor (f2 factor) was used to compare the dissolution profile of each formulation. The insoluble excipients, especially dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, caused the drug to be released at a slower rate and to a lesser extent than the soluble excipients. Soluble excipients created a more permeable hydrated gel layer for drug release, increased the porosity resulting in faster diffusion of drug, and increased the rate of tablet erosion. Use of binary mixtures of lactose monohydrate and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate produced release profiles of intermediate duration. Rapid drug dissolution was obtained when only 9.1% w/w of lactose monohydrate was present in the tablet formulation. Only when the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate level was sufficiently high (36.5% w/w) was the release rate and extent decreased. It was demonstrated that the type and level of excipient influenced the rate and extent of drug release from controlled release tablets containing HPMC. The release mechanism of alprazolam from each tablet formulation was described by either the Hixson-Crowell cube root kinetics equation or Peppas's equation. However, the different excipient types investigated did not influence the release mechanism of alprazolam from the final tablets.",

    "65": "We recently demonstrated that a variant allele of CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3) confers low CYP3A5 expression as a result of improper mRNA splicing. In this study, we further evaluated the regulation of CYP3A5 in liver and jejunal mucosa from white donors. For all tissues, high levels of CYP3A5 protein were strongly concordant with the presence of a wild-type allele of the CYP3A5 gene (CYP3A5*1). CYP3A5 represented greater than 50% of total CYP3A content in nearly all of the livers and jejuna that carried the CYP3A5*1 wild-type allele. Overall, CYP3A5 protein content accounted for 31% of the variability in hepatic midazolam hydroxylation activity. Improperly spliced mRNA (SV1-CYP3A5) was found only in tissues containing a CYP3A5*3 allele. Properly spliced CYP3A5 mRNA (wt-CYP3A5) was detected in all tissues, but the median wt-CYP3A5 mRNA was 4-fold higher in CYP3A5*1/*3 livers compared with CYP3A5*3/*3 livers. Differences in wt-CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 mRNA content explained 53 and 51% of the interliver variability in CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 content, respectively. Hepatic CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 contents were not correlated when all livers were compared. However, for CYP3A5*1/*3 livers, levels of the two proteins were strongly correlated (r = 0.93) as were wt-CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 mRNA (r = 0.76). These findings suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes share a common regulatory pathway for constitutive expression, possibly involving conserved elements in the 5'-flanking region.", 
    "66": "Suppression of malignant ventricular arrhythmias by selective blockade of the cardiac slowly activating delayed rectifier current (I(Ks)) has been demonstrated with the benzodiazepine L-768673 [(R)-2-(2,4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[2-oxo-5-phenyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl]acetamide] in canine models of recent and healed myocardial infarction. The present study extends the initial antiarrhythmic assessment of I(Ks) blockade by demonstrating prevention of ischemic malignant arrhythmias in dogs with recent (8.0 +/- 0.4 days) anterior myocardial infarction with the coadministration of a subeffective dose of L-768673 and a subeffective, minimally beta-adrenergic blocking dose of timolol. Administered individually, neither 0.3 microg/kg i.v. L-768673 nor 1.0 microg/kg i.v. timolol prevented the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) by programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) or the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmia in response to acute coronary artery thrombosis. In contrast, coadministration of 0.3 microg/kg i.v. L-768673 + 1.0 microg/kg i.v. timolol suppressed the induction of VT by PVS (8/10, 80% rendered noninducible versus 1/10, 10% noninducible in vehicle group; p < 0.01) and prevented the development of acute ischemic lethal arrhythmias (3/10, 30% incidence versus 8/10, 80% incidence in vehicle group; p < 0.05). Concomitant administration of low-dose L-768673 + timolol produced modest increases in QTc and paced QT intervals (4.5 +/- 1.2 and 5.5 +/- 1.4%; both p < 0.01), increases in noninfarct zone relative and effective refractory periods (7.0 +/- 1.7 and 12.3 +/- 3.0%; both p < 0.01), and lesser increases in infarct zone relative and effective refractory periods (5.3 +/- 1.6 and 5.8 +/- 1.4%; both p < 0.01).

    "67": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)) receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels and are the major inhibitory transmitter receptors in the central nervous system. The majority of these receptors is composed of two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunits. To identify sequences important for subunit assembly, we generated C-terminally truncated and chimeric gamma(3) constructs. From their ability to associate with full-length alpha(1) and beta(3) subunits, we concluded that amino acid sequence gamma(3)(70-84) either directly interacts with alpha(1) or beta(3) subunits or stabilizes a contact site elsewhere in the protein. The observation that this sequence contains amino acid residues homologous to gamma(2) residues contributing to the benzodiazepine-binding site at the alpha(1)/gamma(2) interface suggested that in alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(3) receptors the sequence gamma(3)(70-84) is located at the alpha(1)/gamma(3) interface. In the absence of alpha(1) subunits this sequence might allow assembly of beta(3) with gamma(3) subunits. Other experiments indicated that sequences gamma(3)(86-95) and gamma(3)(94-107), which are homologous to previously identified sequences important for assembly of gamma(2) subunits, are also important for assembly of gamma(3) subunits. This indicates that during assembly of the GABA(A) receptor, more than one N-terminal sequence is important for binding to the same neighboring subunit. Whether the three sequences investigated are involved in direct interaction or stabilize other regions involved in intersubunit contacts has to be further studied.", 
    "68": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The GABAA receptor complex, which is assumed to have a pentamer structure assembled from different polypeptide subunits, contains the binding sites for several clinically important compounds, e.g., the benzodiazepines and the barbiturates. A dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission mediated via the GABAA receptor has been hypothesised to be a central factor in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Antisense technology is based on the possibility of selectively inhibiting gene expression at the level of messengerRNA (mRNA). An antisense oligodeoxy nucleotide (ODN), a short synthetic single-stranded DNA molecule, is believed to inhibit the biosynthesis of a particular protein via nucleotide specific hybridisation to the mRNA encoding the protein. Antisense ODNs are used as tools for the investigation of the physiological roles played by individual proteins. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of selectively inhibiting the expression of a major subunit of the GABAA receptor complex in the rat brain in vivo by means of antisense technology. The thesis describes the changes observed following intrahippocampal administration of antisense ODN targeted to the GABAA receptor gamma 2 subunit. This subunit is a constituent of the majority of GABAA receptor complexes in the brain. Biochemical, morphological, electroencephalographic and behavioural changes induced by the antisense ODN treatment are described. The results support the notion that the primary event induced by the antisense ODN is a specific down-regulation of the gamma 2 subunit protein and that this leads to a decrease in the number of functional GABAA receptors and a state of diminished hippocampal GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. Antisense ODN-treated rats spontaneously develop limbic status epilepticus; prolonged antisense ODN treatment results in severe neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus. The results of the study support the hypothesis that the GABAA receptor is critically involved in epileptogenesis. The results are viewed as a contribution to the understanding of the GABAA receptor complex and of mechanisms of epileptic phenomena and neuronal cell death. The presented animal model is suggested as a pathophysiologically relevant model of temporal lobe epilepsy and limbic status epilepticus. The results may also be of value for the general characterisation of antisense technology as a neuroscientific tool.",

    "70": "The abuse of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), flunitrazepam, ketamine hydrochloride, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is discussed. Club drugs are chemical substances used recreationally in social settings. Use is increasingly frequent among young people, especially during all-night dance parties. All four agents have been classified as controlled substances. MDMA (\"ecstasy\") is available as a tablet, a capsule, and a powder; formulations may contain many adulterants. MDMA increases the release of neurotransmitters. The desired effects are euphoria, a feeling of intimacy, altered visual perception, enhanced libido, and increased energy. The most common adverse effects are agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, and hypertension. More serious adverse effects include arrhythmias, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis. Flunitrazepam is a potent benzodiazepine. At higher doses, the drug can cause lack of muscle control and loss of consciousness. Other adverse effects are hypotension, dizziness, confusion, and occasional aggression. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used primarily in veterinary practice. It may be injected, swallowed, snorted, or smoked. Like phencyclidine, ketamine interacts with the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel. Analgesic effects occur at lower doses and amnestic effects at higher doses. Cardiovascular and respiratory toxicity may occur, as well as confusion, hostility, and delirium. GHB, a naturally occurring fatty acid derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid, was introduced as a dietary supplement. Increasing doses progressively produce amnesia, drowsiness, dizziness, euphoria, seizures, coma, and death. Flunitrazepam, ketamine, and GHB have been used to facilitate sexual assault. Supportive care is indicated for most cases of club drug intoxication. The increasing abuse of MDMA, flunitrazepam, ketamine hydrochloride, and GHB, particularly by young people in social settings such as clubs, should put health care professionals on guard to recognize and manage serious reactions.",

For induction of anesthesia, patients of the COM-group received 0,05 mg/kg BW midazolam und 1,0 mg/kg BW propofol, and anesthesia was maintained with 0,05 mg/kg BW/h midazolam (until 15 - 30 min before the end of the operation) together with propofol in decreasing doses of 10 - 5 - 2 mg/kg BW/h. In the control-group, 2,0 mg/kg BW propofol were used for induction followed by decreasing doses of 10 - 5 - 2 mg/kg BW/h as well.

    "75": "Neonatal ventral hippocampal (NVH) lesions in rats have been shown to induce behavioral abnormalities at adulthood thought to simulate some aspects of positive, negative and cognitive deficits classically observed in schizophrenic patients. Such lesions induced a post-pubertal emergence of prepulse inhibition deficits reminiscent of the sensorimotor gating deficits observed in a large majority of schizophrenic patients. Here we have investigated the capacity of typical and atypical antipsychotics to reverse PPI deficits seen in NVH-lesioned rats. We show that three atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone) were able to reverse lesion-induced PPI deficits, in contrast to haloperidol, a classical neuroleptic. These results show that the NVH lesion model seems to be endowed with a fair predictive validity as, like in schizophrenic patients, PPI deficits in lesioned animals were reversed by atypical antipsychotics but not by the typical neuroleptic haloperidol.", 
    "76": "Few well-controlled studies have examined psychomotor and cognitive performance in methadone maintenance patients (MMP). In the present study, performance of 18 opioid-dependent MMP was evaluated relative to that of 21 control participants without substance abuse histories. The MMP and control groups were balanced with respect to gender, race, age, years of education, current employment status, current reading level, and estimated IQ score. Recent drug abstinence was verified by urine testing. Participants with a urine screen positive for benzodiazepines or a breathalyzer test positive for alcohol prior to performance testing were excluded. To avoid testing under conditions of acute heroin or cocaine intoxication, but without testing under conditions of acute withdrawal, participants with current use of heroin or cocaine were only required to abstain for 24 h prior to performance testing. MMP exhibited impairment relative to controls in psychomotor speed (digit symbol substitution and trail-making tests), working memory (two-back task), decision making (gambling task), and metamemory (confidence ratings on a recognition memory test); results also suggested possible impairment in inhibitory mechanisms (Stroop color-word paradigm). MMP did not exhibit impairment in time estimation, conceptual flexibility or long-term memory. The wide range of impaired functions is striking, and may have important implications for daily functioning in MMP. Further research is necessary to determine the clinical significance of the impairments in laboratory-based tests for daily performance in the natural environment, as well as to differentiate impairments due to acute methadone dosing, chronic methadone maintenance, chronic poly-drug abuse, and other factors.", 
    "77": "The effects of allopregnanolone and midazolam, given intracerebroventricularly, on the behavioral and biochemical effects of picrotoxin, were examined in a model of neurotoxin-induced seizures, in mice. After acute injections, midazolam (ED(50)=39.8 nmol) and allopregnanolone (ED(50)=11.0 nmol) produced similar and dose-dependent protection against picrotoxin-induced seizures. Picrotoxin given intraperitoneally at the ED(85) dose decreased significantly the concentration of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), homovanilic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyindolacetic acid (DOPAC), in the mouse striatum and the frontal cortex, in the period of time immediately preceding the onset of seizures. A single injection of allopregnanolone more potently, in comparison to midazolam, antagonized the biochemical action of picrotoxin, abolishing its effects on DA, HVA and 5-HT concentration, in the mouse striatum and the frontal cortex. These results for the first time provide a direct argument for an involvement of central dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the seizure development. The present data add also to the accumulating evidence suggesting a favorable pharmacological profile for some neurosteroids currently considered to have a future role in the management of epilepsy.", 
    "78": "The anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in rats is reduced after a single exposure to the elevated plus-maze test (EPM). Several hypotheses have been formulated but no conclusive explanation exists for this phenomenon called \"one-trial tolerance.\" In this study, we examined this phenomenon further by carrying out an ethopharmacological analysis of the behavior of rats submitted to the EPM in two trials. Rats injected with saline before both trials (control), treated with 1.0 mg/kg of midazolam before both trials (MM), or only before Trial 2 (SM), were exposed to the EPM. The SM group did not differ from the controls in the Trial 1 and Trial 2 conditions. The MM group showed a clear anxioselective profile in Trial 1 and no anxiolytic-like effects in Trial 2. Whereas midazolam injected before the first trial caused no significant change in immobility, there was a pronounced increase in immobility during Trial 2 for all three conditions. These data suggest that the anxiolytic-like action of midazolam in the first trial gives way to the fear-related insensitive behaviors (phobic/avoidance responses) responsible for the one-trial tolerance to BZDs in Trial 2. Furthermore, an additional experiment showed that midazolam does not seem to affect the acquisition of the learned avoidance response since it is present upon retesting even after midazolam administration in Trial 1 (MS group). Rather, the present data suggest an emotional shift from Trial 1 to Trial 2, which leads to change in the responsiveness of the animals to BZDs.", 
    "79": "The GABA(A) receptor positive modulator allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) is a potent neurosteroid with behavioral and biochemical characteristics similar to ethanol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. This suggests that neurosteroids may provide an alternative class of sedative/hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic pharmacotherapies. However, there is evidence from animal models that neurosteroids may be susceptible to abuse by humans. Thus, the present study evaluated the reinforcing effects of orally administered allopregnanolone in rats. In the first experiment, male Long-Evans rats (n=9) were allowed to voluntarily consume a 50-microg/ml allopregnanolone (50A) solution or water in an unlimited-access two-bottle choice procedure for 10 days. Subsequently, the same animals were trained to lever-press to receive a 50A solution in daily 30-min operant sessions using a sucrose substitution procedure. In the two-bottle choice procedure, rats consumed significantly more allopregnanolone than water, suggesting that allopregnanolone was serving as a reinforcer. In the operant self-administration procedure, allopregnanolone did not maintain levels of responding that were different from water, suggesting that allopregnanolone did not function as a reinforcer in this procedure. These results suggest that orally administered allopregnanolone possesses reinforcing properties; however, additional studies are necessary to determine whether operant oral self-administration will be a viable index of allopregnanolone's reinforcing effects.",

A baseline dose-effect curve was generated for amphetamine administration alone, using doses both above and below the training dose (0.0-2.2 mg/kg ip). Once completed, a single dose of olanzapine (OLZ; 1.5 mg/kg sc) was tested for its ability to attenuate the amphetamine cue. OLZ pretreatment (60 min) successfully interfered with an animal's ability to discriminate amphetamine injections across various doses. The percentage of correct responding on the amphetamine lever and rate of responding were both significantly decreased across some but not all of the amphetamine doses. Therefore, we believe that this preliminary investigation has successfully shown that an OLZ dose of 1.5 mg/kg sc at 60 min can interfere with an animal's ability to detect some subjective cue(s) associated with amphetamine administration.",

    "82": "This study's conclusions are based on analysis of official data on overdose deaths attributed to illicit drug addiction and abuse (ICD-9 codes 304 and 305) from 1984 to 2000, drawn from two archives of drug abuse information: the Direzione Centrale per i Servizi Antidroga (DADE) of the Italian Ministry of the Interior (1984-2000), and the Health Statistics held at the Italian Central Statistics Institute (ISTAT) (1984-1997). Mortality rates have been calculated for both genders in the following age groups: 15-24, 25-34, and 35-44 years.", 
    "83": "Official data indicate that there has been a steady increase in the number of deaths by overdose in Italy over recent 15 years. This trend has affected both genders, but is more evident among males. Over the whole period females had consistently lower overdose rates than males. In both genders the age group 35-44 was subject to the highest mortality rate increase over the study period, however, the highest overdose rates for both males and females were observed in the 25-34 age group. Consistently higher rates were witnessed in the northern regions of Italy with an overall increase across all latitudes. However, the greatest increase over the study period occurred in the South. In 5190 cases evaluated by the Italian Forensic Toxicology Group, 95.9% of deaths were attributed to heroin, but in about half of these, mixtures of three or more substances (heroin, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone) were found in the deceased at doses that were likely to have contributed to death.", 
    "84": "The increase observed in the rates of death by overdose is likely to be a reflection of increased use of illicit drugs in the general population. Reporting practice by forensic pathologists might explain the extent of attribution of cause of death to heroin. Drop-out from addiction treatment is a commonly observed antecedent of fatal opioid overdose, therefore, caution is required when establishing treatment protocol for patients. Interventions that aim specifically at improving patient compliance with medical and psychiatric therapies should be favoured.",

The compounds were evaluated for their capacity to potentiate or inhibit GABA-evoked currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A) receptors. The benzyl, ethyl, and allyl carbamates ((R)-9a (100 microM), (+/-)-9b (100 microM), (+/-)-9c (200 microM)) stimulated GABA currents by 279 +/- 47%, 426 +/- 8%. and 765 +/- 61%, respectively, while the phenylcarboxamide (+/-)-9f (200 microM) stimulated currents by 420 +/- 33%. Concentration-response studies showed that compound 9c was approximately twice as potent in stimulating GABA currents as alpha-EMTBL (2), the most potent 3,3-dialkylbutyrolactone known to date. On the other hand, the N-sulfonyl analogues were much less active or even inhibited GABA-evoked currents. In vitro radioligand displacement studies on rat brain membranes showed that these compounds did not bind to the benzodiazepine or GABA recognition sites of the GABA(A) receptor. However, these compounds generally weakly displaced [(35)S]-TBPS (approximately 50% displacement at 100 microM), though potencies did not correlate with GABA current potentiation. Results obtained with alpha1beta1 and mutant alpha1beta2N265S receptors, which compared to alpha1beta2 receptors are both much less sensitive to current stimulation produced by the anticonvulsant loreclezole, suggest that at least some of these aminobutyrolactones, (e.g., 9a, 9c), and interestingly also alpha-EMTBL, share stimulatory properties with loreclezole.", 
    "86": "Database mining methods rely on the molecular descriptors used to characterize a structural database. In the present investigation, five different types of descriptors (log P, UNITY fingerprints, ISIS keys, VolSurf, and GRIND) are applied to characterize various databases (n = 1007, 100, and 229) comprising drugs almost exclusively. The validity of the descriptors is comparatively analyzed via principal component analysis and its hierarchical variant, consensus principal component analysis. Both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic aspects of database mining are treated. For pharmacodynamic aspects, clustering behavior achieved with the different descriptors is tested on the chemically homogeneous beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, and penicillins and on the chemically more diverse class I antiarrhythmics. The following ranking is observed: UNITY fingerprints > ISIS keys and GRIND > VolSurf > log P. Regarding information content, the CPCA superweight plot indicates similarity between fingerprints and ISIS keys as well as between VolSurf and log P, while GRIND differs from all the remaining descriptors. Solubility data and blood/brain barrier penetrating behavior serve as test cases for pharmacokinetic aspects. Comparison of the descriptors applied to these data reveals that VolSurf has the most realistic and consistent behavior, GRIND shows intermediate behavior, while UNITY fingerprints and ISIS keys are not well suited for pharmacokinetic profiling. From this comparative analysis, we conclude that VolSurf descriptors exhibit particular advantages in treating pharmacokinetic aspects; UNITY fingerprints, ISIS keys, and GRIND descriptors are of special value for tackling pharmacodynamic aspects of database mining. The parameter log P is of limited applicability in database mining because of rather poor reliability and lack of completeness of data.",

However, the nerve injury-induced molecular changes are not fully identified. To determine the molecular alterations in a broader way, we have carried out cDNA array on the genes mainly made from the cDNA libraries of lumbar DRGs of normal rats and of rats 14 days after peripheral axotomy. Of the 7,523 examined genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs), the expression of 122 genes and 51 expressed sequence tags is strongly changed. These genes encompass a large number of members of distinct families, including neuropeptides, receptors, ion channels, signal transduction molecules, synaptic vesicle proteins, and others. Of particular interest is the up-regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor alpha5 subunit, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit, P2Y1 purinoceptor, Na(+) channel beta2 subunit, and L-type Ca(2+) channel alpha2delta-1 subunit.

    "105": "Epilepsy and developmental disabilities (DD) often occur together but affect individuals differently and have a complex causal relationship. Most epilepsy in the population with DD is partial or symptomatic generalized. Seizures and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can further delay development, and the DD can complicate treatment and adjustment to epilepsy. Medical care and decision making require careful coordination of health care providers and the family, especially because of the trend for the patients to live in group homes. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders are difficult to diagnose but common in those with DD and epilepsy; psychiatric disorders are perhaps up to sevenfold higher in this group than in the general population. Psychotropic medications-antidepressants, anxiolytics (but use caution with benzodiazepines), antipsychotics, and stimulants-are appropriate for those with psychiatric disorders. Diagnostic difficulties may lead to undertreatment, and the motivation to lessen certain behaviors may lead to overtreatment. Because those with DD may be unusually sensitive to adverse effects of both seizures and AEDs, cognitive and behavioral side effects must be carefully monitored. Few relevant studies exist. For some patients, comorbid psychiatric disorders may be treated with one AED, such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or valproate. Phenobarbital and phenytoin may be inappropriate for those with epilepsy and DD. Studies have shown some success with oxcarbazepine (for partial and generalized epilepsy) and with adjunctive lamotrigine. For those on medication regimens, perhaps taking combinations of drugs for numerous years, queries about earlier attempts to reduce AEDs and gradual efforts to substitute less toxic mediations are worthwhile. Vagus nerve stimulation and epilepsy surgery for those with medically refractory epilepsy may be options after careful evaluation.",

The patients were allocated randomly to one of three groups, to receive either midazolam 0.02 mg.kg(-1), propofol 0.25 mg.kg(-1), or normal saline 2 ml (placebo) 2 min prior to induction of anaesthesia using propofol 1% infusion at 300 ml.h(-1). The propofol dose requirements for induction were recorded for two end-points (loss of verbal contact and insertion of an oropharyngeal airway). Cardiovascular parameters were recorded at 1-min intervals for each patient until induction was complete. The midazolam group showed a significant reduction in propofol dose requirements for induction (p = 0.05) compared to the placebo group. The propofol group did not show a significant dose reduction compared to placebo. There were no demonstrable differences in terms of improved cardiovascular stability between groups. We conclude that propofol predosing does not significantly reduce the induction dose of propofol required in the elderly, and there were no cardiovascular benefits to either midazolam co-induction or propofol predosing in the elderly.",

Four operating modes were first optimized: the electron impact ionization and chemical ionization modes were compared on both underivatized and trimethylsilylated drugs. Results were compared in terms of sensitivity in MS-MS experiments. The trimethylsilylation of benzodiazepines including a protic functional group allows decreasing their detection threshold by a factor of 10-100. In terms of sensitivity, the comparison between both ionization modes shows that the most efficient one depends on the benzodiazepine considered. The use of an ion trap analyzer allows switching from an ionization mode to another one during the chromatographic process. It also provides a great selectivity owing to the MS-MS and multiple reaction monitoring acquisition modes. The detection thresholds are in the range 10-500 pg/microl for all the studied benzodiazepines but the three \"triazolo\" ones: estazolam, alprazolam and triazolam, have a detection threshold of 1 ng/microl.

Classical heterocycle forming reactions such as the Fischer indole, the Bischler-Napieralski tetrahydroisoquinoline, the Pictet-Spengler tetrahydro-beta-carboline, the Tsuge, the Nenitzescu and the Richter cinnoline reaction are presented. In addition, the Heck, Sonogashira, Wittig, Diels-Alder, and olefin metathesis reactions have been also used. Multicomponent reactions such as the Grieco three-component assembly have been exploited for the synthesis of heterocycles. Cyclative cleavage from the solid support is particularly suitable for the synthesis of heterocycles while particular emphasis has been focused on the synthesis of libraries and the use of combinatorial chemistry techniques.

    "119": "Although administered as a short-acting hypnotic for sleeping disorders, flunitrazepam, often in combination with alcohol or other drugs, was one of the most frequently abused benzodiazepines over the last 10 years. It has been reported in cases of driving under the influence, and its use is associated with marked psychomotor impairment. Studies over the last five years have investigated the use of oral fluid as an alternative matrix to blood and urine, especially when non-intrusive and quick sampling procedures are important (e.g., screening for drugs of abuse at the roadside and screening and confirmatory workplace drug testing). In this study, Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) was administered to four healthy volunteers, and oral fluid samples were collected by spitting into a polypropylene tube at fixed times between 0 and 6 h after the intake of a tablet of 1 mg. A specific and very sensitive method was developed, both for flunitrazepam and for its main metabolite 7-aminoflunitrazepam, based on solid-phase extraction of the oral fluid samples, stored at +4 degrees C, and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses using negative chemical ionization with methane as the ionization gas. The heptadeuterated parent compound and metabolite were used as internal standards. The respective limits of detection and quantitation were 0.05 microg/L and 0.1 microg/L for flunitrazepam, and 0.1 and 0.15 microg/L for 7-aminoflunitrazepam. The parent drug could only be detected when the analyses were performed within 12-24 h after collection of the oral fluid samples or when 2% of NaF was added to the collection tubes. The stability of flunitrazepam in oral fluid was poor, even at +4 degrees C, when no NaF was added to the sample. In any case, concentrations remained below 1 microg/L. The metabolite was detected in slightly higher concentrations, with or without the presence of NaF, reaching a maximum of 1-3 microg/L within 2-4 h after administration. In all cases the drug was detectable, but at extremely low concentrations, for 6 h after intake of a normal dose of Rohypnol and it will be an analytical challenge to come up with a sufficiently sensitive onsite test for low-dose benzodiazepines in oral fluid.", 
    "120": "Several studies have demonstrated a variety of effects of intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) lesions on circadian rhythm regulation. Recent studies have suggested the possibility that certain rhythm functions attributed to the IGL are actually controlled by retinorecipient midbrain nuclei or other brain areas connected to the IGL. The present investigations evaluated whether midbrain lesions previously shown to block the phasic actions of benzodiazepine would also reduce or eliminate the period-lengthening effect of constant light (LL), a function that has been attributed to the IGL. Experiment 1 established that the circadian period of controls lengthened by about 0.57 h when the animals were transferred from constant dark (DD) to LL, but the magnitude of change was attenuated by about 50% in animals with IGL lesions caused by the neurotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). In experiment 2, controls were compared to groups receiving either NMDA lesions of the pretectum or tectum or knife cuts designed to sever connections between the IGL and more medial retinorecipient nuclei. As in experiment 1, there were no differences between groups with respect to circadian period in DD. However, unlike experiment 1, all groups lengthened period equally in LL (overall mean increase = 0.57 h). Thus, the effect of LL on circadian period appears to be a joint result of photic information arriving at the circadian clock directly from the retinohypothalamic tract and indirectly through the IGL via the geniculohypothalamic tract, without involvement of visual midbrain. The results may have implications for the anatomical basis of Aschoff's rule.",

    "126": "There has been a significant evolution in the clinical management of the poisoned patient over the last decade. Interventions that were once the cornerstone of treating the poisoned patient have become pass\u00e9 or have come under intense scrutiny. The advent of evidence-based medicine has forced clinical scientists to re-evaluate standard therapies. Gastrointestinal decontamination with either emesis or gastric lavage was the foundation of the initial management of most poisoned patients. Examination of the published literature demonstrated that neither emesis nor lavage changed the ultimate outcome of poisoned patients, and most poison centers have abandoned their use. Even the use of activated charcoal has been questioned. A multitude of studies demonstrated that the effectiveness of activated charcoal diminished significantly 30-60 min after the ingestion of a poison. No study has demonstrated that charcoal changed patient outcome. Cathartics have been deemed to be ineffective and potentially dangerous and are never indicated. Whole bowel irrigation should not be used routinely in the management of the poisoned patient. Multiple dose activated charcoal and urinary alkalinization, commonly used to enhance the elimination of some poisons, have limited usefulness. While these 'old' and more general methods of 'detoxification' have thus failed in most cases to improve or change patient outcome, the use of more specific antidotes, tailored to the exact cause of intoxication is to be considered. Very few antidotes, however, are used on a consistent basis in the management of poisoned victims. The indiscriminate use of antidotes may even be harmful to the patient and incur an inordinate expense. In addition to the commonly known antidotes N-acetylcysteine (acetaminophen, paracetamol), naloxone (opioids) and flumazenil (benzodiazepines), new antidotes include fomepizole to treat ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning and Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) for pit viper envenomation.", 
    "127": "Currently, tardive dyskinesia (TD) remains an important clinical problem. The average prevalence is estimated at 30%. The appearance of antipsychotics has opened new paths. The extrapyramidal profile of these molecules is more favorable than that of conventional neuroleptics. In order to assess their prophylactic as well as curative potential, we reviewed the literature concerning four of these atypical antipsychotics: clozapine, risperidone olanzapine and amisulpride. Clozapine seems to induce fewer cases of TD than the conventional neuroleptics, and has a specific therapeutic effect. However, the risk of agranulocytosis reduces the possibility of utilisation. Risperidone appears to be an effective therapy, but several authors report cases of TD during treatment. Furthermore, larger studies and longer follow-ups are necessary to confirm the efficiency of olanzapine and amisulpride. Further studies and observations are still necessary before drawing any conclusion for these new atypical antipsychotic actions. They are doubtlessly promising, but we cannot ignore the notion of risk-benefit; regular monitoring and listening to the subjective experience of the patients must remain uppermost in the choice of therapy.", 
    "128": "A single exposure to the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test of anxiety reduces or abolishes the anxiolytic-like efficacy of benzodiazepines. This phenomenon called one-trial tolerance has been suggested to represent the acquisition of a phobic-like response to the open arms during trial 1. The present study was designed to examine the effects of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, ip) on the behaviour of rats in a conventional EPM apparatus after previous exposure to a four-open-arm EPM, a four-enclosed arm EPM or a conventional EPM, as well as in naive rats. Chlordiazepoxide had clear-cut anxiolytic-like effects (increased percentage of time spent on the open arms) in a traditional EPM in naive rats and in animals previously exposed to a four-open-arm EPM. However, it was ineffective in rats previously exposed to a traditional or a four-closed-arm EPM. Thus, the phenomenon of one-trial tolerance does not depend upon initial open-arm experience.",

We compared two commonly used anesthetic treatments, urethane alpha-chloralose (U-alphaCh; 968 mg U and 65 mg alphaCh/kg) and 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (TBE; 435 mg/kg) and fentanyl fluanisone midazolam (FFM; 3.313 mg fentanyl, 104.8 mg fluanisone, and 52.42 mg midazolam/kg) with respect to mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) for 100 min at similar levels of surgical anesthesia. Assessed every 10 to 15 min, the U-alphaCh+TBE group maintained a significantly (P < 0.001) lower mean MAP (49 4 mmHg) than did the FFM group (78 5 mmHg). Mean HR in the U-alphaCh+TBE group significantly (P < 0.001) increased from 308 34 bpm at the beginning to 477 43 bpm at the end of the experiment. In comparison, the FFM group showed a stable HR of 431 37 bpm. The MAP and HR of the U-alphaCh+TBE group were extremely unstable, with sudden and unpredictable changes in MAP when examined at 1-min intervals. The results of our study show that U-alphaCh+TBE anesthesia should not be used in murine models in which stable, near-physiologic hemodynamics are needed for cardiovascular studies.",

    "134": "The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of olanzapine or risperidone treatment on beta-cell function in healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to single-blind therapy with olanzapine (10 mg/d; n = 17), risperidone (4 mg/d; n = 13), or placebo (n = 18) for 15-17 d. Insulin secretion was quantitatively assessed at baseline and the end of the study period using the hyperglycemic clamp. Weight increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the olanzapine (2.8 +/- 1.7 kg) and risperidone (3.1 +/- 2.1 kg) treatment groups. An increase ( approximately 25%) in the insulin response to hyperglycemia and a decrease ( approximately 18%) in the insulin sensitivity index were observed after treatment with olanzapine and risperidone. The change in insulin response was correlated (r = 0.5576; P = 0.019) with a change in body mass index. When the impact of weight change was accounted for by multivariate regression analyses, no significant change in insulin response or insulin sensitivity was detected after treatment with olanzapine or risperidone. We found no evidence that treatment of healthy volunteers with olanzapine or risperidone decreased the insulin secretory response to a prolonged hyperglycemic challenge. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that olanzapine or risperidone directly impair pancreatic beta-cell function.",

After the addition of a deuterium labelled internal standard of flunitrazepam, plasma samples were extracted using Oasis(R) MCX solid phase extraction cartridges. The compounds were separated on a 5 microm Symmetry C18 (Waters) column (3.0 x 150 mm, i.d.) with a step gradient of acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The overall extraction efficiency was more than 89% for all three compounds. The limits of detection were 0.25 g/l for flunitrazepam, 0.5 microg/l for 7-aminoflunitrazepam, and 2.0 microg/l for N-desmethylflunitrazepam. Within-run accuracies for quality-control samples were between 92.5 and 101.3% of the target concentration, with coefficients of variation <8%. The proposed method enables the unambiguous identification and quantitation of flunitrazepam and its major metabolites in both clinical and forensic specimens.", 
    "136": "Intracellular and extracellular pH are known to influence neuronal activity and may play a role in seizure termination. In the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus in the urethane anesthetized adult rat, there is an initial alkalinization in response to stimulus trains administered to the contralateral CA3 region. This is followed by an acidification that peaks after termination of the afterdischarge. Initial experiments demonstrated that the peak level of acidification correlated with the duration of the afterdischarge, but that the peak level of alkalinization did not. The effects of several antiepileptic drugs on the initial alkalinization were determined. Systemic administration of acetazolamide (50 mg/kg, n=4) and topiramate (45 mg/kg, n=7) and local administration of benzolamide (n=3), all of which inhibit carbonic anhydrase, decreased the initial alkalinization that occurs during the stimulus train. Diazepam (3 mg/kg, n=5) and phenobarbital (60 mg/kg, n=6), agonists at the GABA(A) receptor complex, increased the initial alkalinization, while sodium channel blockers phenytoin (80 mg/kg, n=5) and carbamazepine (50 mg/kg, n=5) had no significant effect. The data suggest that the alkalinization in CA1 in vivo is predominantly regulated through activity of the GABA(A) receptor, rather than through activation of glutamatergic receptors. The change in alkalinization does not appear to be related to the mechanism of the antiepileptic effect of the drugs that were tested.",

The mucigenous stomach function was investigated by the biochemical method at the level of sialic acids fractions, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans and proteins. It was shown that at the exacerbation of the ulcerative disease the expressed changes in gastric mucus were observed. It was shown, that Mi-cholinolytic gastrocepine has the most effective recovering activity on the gastric mucigenous function. The obtained results expand the possibilities of differential use of antisecretory preparations in ulcerative disease in connection with the gastric mucigenous function and acidity disorders.", 
    "169": "Perhaps the most unpleasant experience following outpatient plastic surgery procedures is postoperative nausea and vomiting. Postoperative nausea and vomiting often results in delayed recovery time and unintended admission, and it can be a contributing factor to the formation of hematoma following rhytidectomy. Ondansetron (Zofran) has proven benefit in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting if given before general anesthesia in a variety of surgical procedures. Its utility in cases performed under conscious sedation has not been determined. The purpose of this study was (1) to test the ability of prophylactic ondansetron to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting in plastic surgery cases performed under conscious sedation, and (2) to determine relative risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting and a selection policy for the administration of antiemetic prophylaxis. This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. One hundred twenty patients were enrolled after giving informed consent. Patients received a single dose of either placebo or ondansetron (4 mg intravenously) before administration of sedation. Sedation administration followed a standardized institutional protocol, using midazolam and fentanyl. Data were recorded from a series of three questionnaires: preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at the time of the first office return. Data were confirmed by means of telephone interview, chart analysis, and nursing documentation. Multivariate analysis was conducted. Nausea and emesis occurred with an overall frequency of 33 percent and 22 percent, respectively. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was associated with statistically longer recovery periods. The incidence of emesis was statistically higher among women, among those undergoing facial rejuvenation, and among those with a history of opioid-induced emesis or postoperative nausea and vomiting following a previous operation (p < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting paralleled increases in case duration; the incidence of emesis was zero in cases less than 90 minutes in duration. Ondansetron significantly reduced the incidence of emesis overall (placebo, 30 percent; ondansetron, 13 percent; p < 0.05). Postoperative perception of nausea was significantly lower among those who had received ondansetron (p < 0.05). These results confirm the efficacy of ondansetron for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in plastic surgery cases under conscious sedation. In those who are at increased risk, prophylaxis should be considered. Such risks include female gender, facial rejuvenation procedures, and a patient history of opioid-induced emesis or postoperative nausea and vomiting following a prior operation. The zero incidence of emesis in cases less than 90 minutes does not support the routine use of prophylaxis in such cases. Patient satisfaction in plastic surgery is derived from the overall subjective experience of the event as much as by the final result. By remaining attentive to patient concerns and optimizing perioperative care, we can improve the subjective experience for our patients.", 
    "170": "The oxidation behavior of Y-931, a potent atypical antipsychotic drug, was compared with that of clozapine and olanzapine. In two enzymatic systems (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/glutathione (GSH) and HRP/H(2)O(2)/GSH) which generate thiyl radicals, clozapine markedly strengthened the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal for the radical. Olanzapine, Y-931 and the major metabolites (compounds 1-3) had no or minimal effect on the intensity of this signal. In addition, the redox potential values for the three derivatives were in accord with the EPR spin trapping results. In toxicological experiments in human leukocytes, a concentration-dependent toxicity was observed when neutrophils were incubated with clozapine (1-10 micromol/l) and H(2)O(2) (1 mmol/l). However, Y-931 and olanzapine did not show remarkable toxicity under the conditions.",

Forty-four percent of the patients in the olanzapine group and 43 percent of those in the risperidone group were discharged to supervised residences on the basis of their clinical improvement. There is value in reassessing long-stay patients who have treatment-refractory schizophrenia and giving them systematic trials with new medications that become available.", 
    "172": "The underlying mechanisms of idiopathic dystonias are poorly understood. The dystonic phenotype in the dt(sz) mutant hamster, a model of paroxysmal dystonia, has been suggested to be based on a deficit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons and changes of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the striatum. In order to confirm and extend previous observations, the effects of compounds which bind to different sites of the GABA(A) receptor on the severity of dystonia were determined after striatal microinjections in comparison to systemic treatments in dt(sz) mutants. The GABA(A) receptor agonist (muscimol) and the benzodiazepine (flurazepam) reduced the severity of dystonia after striatal and systemic injections. The antidystonic effects of the barbiturate phenobarbital were less marked both after striatal and intraperitoneal administration of drugs. Intrastriatal injections of GABA delayed the onset of dystonic attacks. Striatal and systemic treatments with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, and with pentylenetetrazole, which reduces GABAergic function, accelerated the onset of dystonia at subconvulsant doses. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonists flumazenil aggravated dystonia after systemic and intrastriatal injections. In all, the present data substantiate the relevance of striatal GABAergic disinhibition in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal dystonia in dt(sz) mutants.",

Specific binding of [(3)H]pirenzepine or [(3)H]quinuclinidylbenzylate to hippocampus preparations was inhibited by (+/-)huprine X. This drug displayed a greater affinity for M(1) (K(i)=0.338+/-0.41 microM) than M(2) (K(i)=4.66+/-0.32 microM) receptors. In functional studies, (+/-)huprine X (1 microM) increased the release of [(3)H]dopamine in cortical synaptosomes, and this effect was partially reverted by atropine and mecamylamine, suggesting an agonistic effect on both M(1) and nicotinic receptors. The inhibitory effect of (+/-)huprine X (10 microM) on [(3)H]acetylcholine release and the subsequent reversion by atropine suggests that the drug also has an agonist effect on M(2) receptors. The present results demonstrate that this acetylcholinesterase inhibitor has an ample cholinergic profile, which suggests a potential source of interest of (+/-)huprine X in Alzheimer's disease therapy.", 
    "174": "There have been many important developments in the diagnosis and treatment of status epilepticus in the recent past. Earlier treatment, including at home by caregivers and in the field by paramedics, has been shown to be safe and effective. Rapid-acting anesthetic agents, such as midazolam and propofol, are being used more often for refractory status epilepticus, though clinical trials are lacking. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is being considered and recognized more often, including in ambulatory patients with a confusional state, after convulsive status epilepticus, and in critically ill patients. Modern technology and continuous digital electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings have taught us many things, but have raised at least as many questions. Much work needs to be done regarding the significance of certain EEG patterns (particularly periodic discharges) and when and how to treat them. This article reviews these issues, concentrating on recent advances and practical issues related to the clinical care of patients with status epilepticus."
