This has been demonstrated using selected pharmacological, biochemical and clinical data obtained with two cyclopyrrolones, zopiclone and suriclone, which, in addition to their capacity of displacing BZ from their sites, simultaneously possess the main pharmacological properties of BZ and well established therapeutic activities, as hypnotic and anxiolytic, respectively. However, although cyclopyrrolones recognize BZ receptor sites, their mechanism of action might not exactly fit with that of BZ. Indeed, using tritiated zopiclone and suriclone, it has been shown that they could act on sites distinct from those of BZ or could induce receptor conformational changes different from those induced by BZ.", 
    "1": "Four phenylpiperazine derivatives exhibited an activity similar to benzodiazepines and meprobamate in the 4-plate test. One of these (compound IV) demonstrated anxiolytic like activity in a step-down avoidance technique, in electroshock induced aggression and in the staircase test. In contrast to benzodiazepines, compound IV was not anticonvulsant, myorelaxant or sedative. Confirmation of the anxiolytic activity of compound IV in animal models was obtained in 3 separate clinical trials in anxious patients. The mechanism of action of these phenylpiperazines appears to be different from the benzodiazepines as they do not displace 3H-diazepam binding nor do they interact with other elements of the GABA receptor macromolecular complex. Instead, compound IV interacts with both dopaminergic and serotoninergic neuron systems. Thus, from this data it would appear that an activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site is not obligatory for anxiolytic activity in man or in animals models.", 
    "2": "CGS 8216 and CGS 9896 are two recently described compounds which interact with benzodiazepine binding sites but have pharmacological, biochemical and behavioral characteristics which distinguish them from classical benzodiazepines. CGS 8216 shows properties of a weak inverse agonist, while CGS 9896 shows properties of a mixed agonist/antagonist. Experiments using quantitative autoradiography to determine benzodiazepine binding site interactions of these compounds in discrete anatomical areas are described. Results indicate that [3H]-CGS 8216 does not show any regional differentiation in binding characteristics in 7 brain areas studied. CGS 9896 preferentially inhibited [3H]-flunitrazepam from cerebellar sites compared to hippocampal dentate gyrus sites, but the magnitude of this effect was small. These data support the conclusion that CGS 9896 is acting preferentially at putative benzodiazepine type 1 sites and is consistent with the mixed agonist/antagonist profile of the compound.", 
    "3": "Twelve patients of both sexes (5 women, 7 men; mean age = 39,9) suffering from marked anxiety as defined by DSM III for generalised anxiety (score greater than 20 on the Hamilton-A scale) but in good physical health, were given 15 mg of clorazepate daily at 8 p.m. for a period of 28 days. Desmethyldiazepam, the active metabolite of clorazepate was measured in blood samples on day 1, 14 and 28 of the experiment as well as the level of anxiety on the Hamilton scale. Anxiety decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14 (mean score declining from 33,9 to 18,4) and from day 14 to day 28 (mean score 18,4 to 14,7). Desmethyldiazepam reached its maximum blood concentration 2 hours after the first intake of clorazepate. A plateau had been reached at day 14 and remained stable up until day 28, indicating the absence of cumulating effects. The dosage remained the same for all patients during the 28 days of the experiment. There were no drop outs and no undesirable effects.", 
    "4": "A classical approach to the control of food consumption has been to assume separate mechanisms for the arousal to eat, on the one hand, and the satiation of feeding responses, on the other. The present paper is concerned with a single, and a comparatively simple, neuronal mechanism which is endowed with properties to allow the complete determination of the level of feeding, from hyperphagia to anorexia. The model for the control of feeding, which is presented here, draws attention to the benzodiazepine receptor found distributed through the brain, and present in certain hypothalamic nuclei. Recent evidence which characterizes the receptor is reviewed, and the various categories of benzodiazepine receptor ligands are described. Pharmacological data, collected in a palatable food consumption model using non-food-deprived rats, demonstrate that benzodiazepine receptor agonists produce hyperphagia, benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists produce anorexia, and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists block both effects. Hence, bidirectional control of food intake can be achieved through differential ligand action at a common set of receptors. Speculatively, these data can be extended, if it is assumed that two endogenous ligands exist in the brain which act like benzodiazepine agonist and inverse agonist, respectively. Evidence for the presence in hypothalamic nuclei of endogenous ligands of the latter kind is discussed. Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced anorexia is also described, and is taken as evidence for the part played by feeding mechanisms in the development of benzodiazepine physical dependence.", 
    "5": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788, were examined in combination with those of picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazole on social and exploratory behaviour in the rat. Both Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (2 mg/kg) reduced social interaction, but there was no additive effect of these drugs together. Ro 15-1788 (10 and 20 mg/kg, which had no intrinsic effects in the holeboard alone) antagonized the reductions in exploratory head-dipping and motor activity produced by low (2 mg/kg), but not by high (4 mg/kg), doses of picrotoxin. In contrast, pentylenetetrazole (20 mg/kg) enhanced the reduction in social interaction produced by Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg), in accordance with previous findings that the reductions in spontaneous behaviour in the holeboard produced by pentylenetetrazole are enhanced by Ro 15-1788. These results show that there are clear functional interactions between these two compounds at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the CNS, and that the nature of these interactions differs for picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazole.", 
    "6": "The effect of pirenzepine, a selective muscarinic antagonist, was tested on the oxotremorine facilitation of the K+-evoked release of [14C]-dopamine from tissue slices of rat nucleus accumbens. The effect of pirenzepine was compared with that of scopolamine and other antagonists which show no heterogeneity in their action on muscarinic receptors in order to determine whether a selective action at a single receptor subtype, M1 or M2, could be distinguished. Pirenzepine and scopolamine both antagonized the oxotremorine-induced (EC50 = 3 X 10(-7) M) facilitation of [14C]-dopamine release with pA2 values of 7.5 and 8.9 respectively. This result indicated that the high affinity pirenzepine receptor (M1) was involved in this response. Low concentrations of 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3 X 10(-10) M), N-methylscopolamine (3 X 10(-9) M) and methyl atropine (10(-8) M) also abolished this facilitatory effect of oxotremorine.", 
    "7": "Experiments on 330 rats were made to study the influence of benzodiazepines (diazepam, dormicum and phenazepam) on 5'-nucleotidase activity in brain homogenates. It was discovered that diazepam and dormicum in doses of 3 and 4 mg, phenazepam in doses of 3.75 and 5 mg per 200 g bw provoked a 16-20% reduction in 5'-nucleotidase activity. The maximal effect of diazepam (3 and 4 mg doses) was attained 1 h after intraperitoneal injection, that of dormicum (3 mg) 30 min and of phenazepam (5 mg) 1 h after intraperitoneal injection. It is assumed that benzodiazepines are involved in AMP metabolism.", 
    "8": "Chronic administration of the benzodiazepine, clonazepam, increased the number of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1) binding sites in the frontal cortex of the rat. The increase reflected a change in the maximum density of binding sites (Bmax) with no change in ligand affinity (Kd). Increased binding occurred after continued exposure (10 days) to large (5.0 mg/kg) doses of clonazepam. The changes in [3H]5-HT binding were regional in that they occurred in membranes from the frontal cortex but not the brainstem. The effects were also at least partially selective for 5-HT receptors since the binding of the beta-adrenergic radioligand, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, was not affected by clonazepam. A second benzodiazepine, diazepam, did not affect the binding of [3H]5-HT at doses of 30 mg/kg per day. The latter data suggest that the effects of benzodiazepines on serotonin 5-HT1 receptors are unique to clonazepam.", 
    "9": "The effects of swimming stress on dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons were studied by an in vivo voltammetry technique. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in rat striatum were measured by differential pulse voltammetry with an electrochemically treated carbon fiber electrode. Exposure to swimming stress for 1 to 10 min to the animal increased the DOPAC and 5-HIAA peaks, which depended on the length of stress. Pretreatment of the rats with diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented completely the stress-induced increase in DOPAC levels but only partially reduced the increase in 5-HIAA levels.", 
    "10": "The differential effects of muscarinic agents on inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and the role in this process of putative muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1 and M2) were investigated in three regions of guinea pig brain. Addition of the agonist oxotremorine-M to slices of neostriatum, cerebral cortex, or hippocampus incubated in the presence of myo-[2-3H]inositol and Li+ resulted in a large accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates (733, 376, and 330% of control, respectively). In each tissue, the principal product formed was myo-inositol 1-phosphate (59-86%), with smaller amounts of glycerophosphoinositol and inositol bisphosphate. Only trace amounts of inositol trisphosphate could be detected. Regional differences were observed in the capacity of certain partial agonists to evoke inositol lipid hydrolysis, the most notable being that of bethanechol, which was four times more effective in the neostriatum than in either the cerebral cortex or hippocampus. In addition, the full agonists, oxotremorine-M and carbamoylcholine, were more potent stimulators of inositol phosphate release in the neostriatum than in the cerebral cortex. The putative M1 selective agonist 4-m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy-2-butynyl trimethyl ammonium chloride had little stimulatory effect in any brain region, whereas the putative M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine blocked the enhanced release of inositol phosphates with high affinity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Ki = 12.1 and 13.9 nM; \"M1\") but with a lower affinity in the neostriatum (Ki = 160 nM; \"M2\"). In contrast to its differential effects on stimulated inositol lipid hydrolysis, no regional differences were observed in the capacity of pirenzepine to displace [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, a muscarinic antagonist, bound to membrane fractions. Atropine, an antagonist that does not discriminate between receptor subtypes, inhibited the enhanced release of inositol phosphates with similar affinities in the three regions (Ki = 0.40-0.60 nM). The results indicate that by measurement of inositol lipid hydrolysis, regional differences in muscarinic receptor coupling characteristics become evident. These differences, which are not readily detected by radioligand binding techniques, might be accounted for by either the presence of functionally distinct receptor subtypes, or alternatively, by regional variations in the efficiency of muscarinic receptor coupling to inositol lipid hydrolysis.", 
    "11": "The heat effect associated with the binding of diazepam to human serum albumin has been measured from pH 5.5 to 9.5 using flow microcalorimetry. The number of protons released upon the binding of one molecule of diazepam to one molecule of albumin was determined from acid-base titration experiments. In addition, the heat associated with the combination of protons with serum albumin was measured calorimetrically. The results of the experiments using these two techniques were used to correct the measured heat of binding and to obtain what will be called here delta H0obs values. These delta H0obs values are strongly pH-dependent: up to pH 7.5 a value of -24.3 (+/- 0.5) kJ X mol-1 is found, whereas at pH 9.5 the value is -44.3 (+/- 1.2). This pH dependence is different from the pH dependence of the induced CD signal of the albumin-diazepam complex. A model is presented in which the pH dependence of delta H0obs is explained. This model takes into account the N-B (neutral to base) conformational change in albumin around neutral pH. Parameters in this model are KN and KB (representing the affinity of diazepam for albumin in the N and B conformation, respectively), delta H0N and delta H0B which are the corresponding standard enthalpy changes, f which represents the fraction of protein in the B conformation, and delta H0(N-B) which represents the heat associated with the N-B transition.", 
    "12": "Some interactions of calcium antagonists with [3H]prazosin and [3H]yohimbine binding sites were investigated in bovine aorta membranes. Diphenylalkylamines (flunarizine, cinnarizine and bepridil) acted as competitors of the two ligands with Ki values in the microM range. With the exception of verapamil, reference compounds (nifedipine, Bay-K 8644, diltiazem) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist PK 11195 did not displace the ligands. The apparent affinity of the diphenylalkylamines for alpha-adrenoceptor was consistent with the concentrations producing vasodilatation.", 
    "13": "Benzodiazepine receptor binding and modulation by pentobarbital and ethanol was studied using the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate to solubilize the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex from the brains of Fischer 344 rats of 3-4, 12-15 and more than 28 months of age. The affinity of the benzodiazepine binding site was significantly lower in the young rats compared to either the mature or senescent animals. However, no age-related changes in the maximum number of benzodiazepine binding sites or GABA concentrations occurred in the detergent extract. Pentobarbital produced practically identical dose-dependent enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding in all 3 age groups. In contrast, ethanol between 0.1 and 200 microM failed to produce a dose-dependent effect on [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding in any age group. The effect of pentobarbital and ethanol on [35S]t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) specific binding to the picrotoxinin binding site was examined in the above solubilized receptor/ionophore complex under the same binding conditions. Both sedative-hypnotics produced a dose-dependent decrease in [35S]TBPS specific binding. However, pentobarbital was over 10,000 times more potent. It appears that ethanol may not enhance [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding in this solubilized preparation because of its weak action at the picrotoxinin binding site.", 
    "14": "Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is routinely used to follow up patients with digestive disease. The influence of premedication with diazepam on the procedure and on patients' acceptance of a second endoscopy was evaluated in a double-blind trial conducted on 81 patients randomized to 3 types of intravenous premedication: placebo (group A, 29 patients), diazepam 5 mg (group B, 27 patients) and diazepam 10 mg (group C, 25 patients). Endoscopy was performed under unfavourable conditions (refusal or agitation) in 12, 4 and 1 patients respectively of groups A, B and C (P less than 0.02). Out of 65 patients questioned one month later, 1 (group A) sternly refused a second endoscopy, 10 accepted unreservedly (O in group A, 4 in group B, 6 in group C; P less than 0.05 between A and C) and 54 accepted reluctantly. To find out whether diazepam was beneficial by impairing memory, a memory score on duration of the procedure was established; there were no significant differences between the three groups (P less than 0.001), but they did not correlate with the patients' acceptance of a second endoscopy. It is concluded that premedication with diazepam 10 mg i.v. makes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy easier to perform and facilitates acceptance of a repeat endoscopy 1 month later. This effect is probably independent of the impairment in memory induced by diazepam.", 
    "15": "Alterations in proto-oncogene expression after stimulation of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) have been investigated. A specific stimulation of c-fos messenger RNA and protein was detected 30 minutes after treatment. This induction was enhanced more than 100-fold in the presence of peripherally active benzodiazepines. The effect was specific as very little change was observed in the levels of c-rasHa, c-rasKi, c-myc, and N-myc messenger RNA's. Under the conditions used here, NGF treatment ultimately results in neurite outgrowth, with a reduction or cessation of cell division. Thus, stimulation of the c-fos gene in this system appeared to be associated with differentiation and not with cellular proliferation. The effect of benzodiazepines was stereospecific and represents a novel action of these compounds at the level of gene expression.", 
    "16": "Benzodiazepines, which are widely prescribed for their antianxiety effects, are shown to be potent stimulators of human monocyte chemotaxis. The chemotactic effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists were blocked by the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist PK-11195, suggesting that these effects are mediated by the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. Diazepam was also active in inducing chemotaxis. Binding studies on purified monocytes revealed high-affinity peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, and the displacement potencies of various benzodiazepines correlated with their relative potencies in mediating chemotaxis. The demonstration of functional benzodiazepine receptors on human monocytes, together with recent evidence of receptor-mediated monocyte chemotaxis by other psychoactive peptides (such as opiate peptides), suggests a biochemical substrate for psychosomatic communication.", 
    "17": "In mutant mice 'Purkinje cell degeneration' (pcd), there is an almost complete degeneration of Purkinje cells followed subsequently by a partial degeneration of granule cells. Recent neurochemical studies have revealed a 50% decrease in benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in 45-day-old pcd mutants after degeneration of the Purkinje cells. At 300 days there is an 80% decrease in BZ receptors concomitant with granule cell losses. To determine the histological localization of these receptor changes this autoradiographic analysis was conducted. An in vitro autoradiographic technique was used to explore [3H]flunitrazepam binding. BZ receptors were found to be more concentrated in the molecular than the granular layer of mutant and control cerebellar cortices. There was, nonetheless, no statistically significant difference in grain counts between control and mutant mice in any layer. Substantial atrophy of cerebellar structures, particularly of the molecular layer, occurred in the mutant mice. It began even before 45 days of age but was extreme at 300 days. When the appropriate mathematical correction factor was introduced for the layer atrophy there was a 60% decrease in grain count in 45-day-old mutants in the molecular layer and a 84% decrease in 300-day-old mutants compared to controls. The initial decrease in total BZ receptors in the 45-day-old mutant animals is associated with a selective loss of Purkinje cells. The amount of receptor binding which persists in the 300-day-old mutants in the molecular layer would appear to reflect binding in the remaining parallel fibers from granule cells which remain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]spiperone to membrane preparations isolated by high speed centrifugation of hamster, rabbit and human melanoma cell homogenates was analyzed. All melanoma cell types expressed a high density of specific binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam (3-4 pmol/mg protein) with a high affinity (Kd about 30 nM). This binding was independent of melanin content of cells and could be classified, based on competition experiments, as a Ro 5-4864-like binding type. Specific [3H]spiperone binding to these cell lines clearly revealed at least two types of binding sites: a low affinity, high capacity type of binding site (Kd greater than 100 nM, Bmax about 50 pmol/mg protein) and a high affinity, low capacity binding site (Kd less than 1 nm, Bmax 30 fmol/mg protein). Binding of spiperone to the low affinity, high capacity site appeared displaceable by NM 113 and dependent on melanin content of the cells and probably represents binding to melanin. Analysis of drug binding to melanoma membrane cell preparations and correlation with drug effects should include the possible involvement of binding to melanin.", 
    "19": "The influence of oleic acid on the interaction between albumin and warfarin, oxyphenbutazone or diazepam has been studied by circular dichroism and equilibrium dialysis. The pH dependences of the molar ellipticity of the drug-albumin complexes and of the free fraction of drug are completely changed by the presence of oleic acid. This phenomenon is attributed to an oleic acid-induced conformational change in both the neutral (N) and the basic (B) conformation of albumin, a change to which the warfarin-oxyphenbutazone binding area and the diazepam binding site is sensitive. The oleic acid-induced conformational states of albumin, the so-called N* and B* conformations, show binding properties that are different from the binding properties of the N and B conformations.", 
    "20": "A case note study of 90 children with tuberous sclerosis showed that 56 had taken nitrazepam for seizures for from one month to 13 years. In 38 children nitrazepam was withdrawn but only two had immediate major seizures. Given that sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills, or ataxia seems to be associated in some children with treatment with nitrazepam, doctors may wish to review their long term prescriptions of this drug in children with tuberous sclerosis.", 
    "21": "Experiments were designed to test for short-term tolerance to morphine and ethyl-ketocyclazocine (EKC), mu and kappa agonists, respectively, and cross-tolerance between the two drugs. Mice were primed with one of the drugs, using doses that did not affect the tail-flick response when tested at a time 1 or 3 hours later, when the same or alternate test drug was administered. All animals were injected with the priming drug IP. In one series of experiments, the test drugs were given SC, and in the other, the test drugs were injected ICV under brief halothane anesthesia. Priming with morphine (30 or 100 mg/kg) significantly raised the ED50 for ICV morphine. Priming with EKC (2 or 6 mg/kg) similarly elevated the ED50's for SC and ICV EKC. Symmetrical cross--tolerance was produced in experiments where the test drugs were administered SC when tested at 3 hrs. The effects of priming with EKC on morphine analgesia was evident when the interval between priming and test drugs was 1 hour. When the test drugs were given ICV, cross-tolerance was also symmetrical: priming with EKC significantly raised the ED50 for morphine and priming with morphine raised the ED50 for EKC when tested at 3 hrs. These data suggest that both agonists act on a common site to produce analgesia as similar pA2 values for naloxone antagonism were determined. The occurrence of short-term tolerance and cross-tolerance to the opiates was unaltered by chronic pretreatment with diazepam, phenobarbital, or amphetamine.", 
    "22": "Clobazam (10 mg/kg) and clonazepam (0.25 mg/kg) were administered to mice twice daily by the intraperitoneal route. The development of tolerance to their anticonvulsant effect was compared using a slow intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazole as the convulsant stimulus. Tolerance to clonazepam developed gradually throughout a 72 h study and did not become significant until the fifth dose. In contrast, tolerance to clobazam occurred extremely rapidly, after only one dose; it was manifested as a single step and no further significant change in protection was observed. Recovery from benzodiazepine tolerance was also studied and seen to occur rapidly with both these compounds; following cessation of dosing, protection was restored to initial levels within 36-48 h.", 
    "23": "Using [3H]diazepam binding, high concentrations of receptors were found in the frontal cortex and lateral amygdala. Infusions of chlordiazepoxide into the lateral amygdala induced a release of responding measured during the component of a conditioned emotional response task previously associated with an aversive stimulus. The lateral amygdala appears to be an important component of the forebrain circuitry involved in the expression of anxiety and sensitive to benzodiazepine drugs.", 
    "24": "Neuronal GABAergic sensitivity was assessed using electrophysiological, biochemical and behavioral techniques following the continuous release and maintenance of relatively constant brain levels of diazepam for greater than or equal to 21 days. Our studies indicate that long-term exposure to diazepam results in: (1) a decrease in iontophoretic sensitivity to GABA in the dorsal raphe nucleus, (2) an increase in the affinity of the GABA recognition site in brain tissue and (3) an increase in susceptibility to bicuculline-induced seizures in the intact animal. Since the decrease in GABAergic responsiveness was observed in the presence of measurable levels of diazepam, it was concluded that this subsensitivity phenomenon is associated with tolerance and not with withdrawal effects of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "25": "The benzodiazepine prescribing habits of 64 maritime doctors were studied through collection and examination of carbon copies of all prescriptions over a 22 week period. Diazepam was the most frequently prescribed anxiolytic benzodiazepine, followed by chlordiazepoxide, then oxazepam. These three drugs accounted for almost 60% of all benzodiazepine prescriptions. Triazolam and flurazepam were prescribed eight times more frequently than the other hypnotics, nitrazepam and temazepam. The number of prescriptions judged to be inappropriately excessive was small (3.3% of 7,066). Efforts by drug manufacturers, pharmaceutical sales representatives and CME providers are needed to make the practicing physician aware of the phamacokinetics of the different benzodiazepines, so that an appropriate choice of drug and frequency of daily doses can be made.", 
    "26": "5 adult dwarf goats were injected intravenously with diazepam, chlorpromazine or isotonic saline. Both diazepam at 0.04 mg/kg and chlorpromazine at 0.5 mg/kg significantly stimulated food intake above the control 0.9% NaCl levels. The stimulatory effect appears to be most pronounced within the first 15 min post injection, and was no longer evident between 30 and 45 min after the bolus injection of the tranquillizers.", 
    "27": "Urapidil (Ebrantil) is a new antihypertensive agent exerting central and peripheral action which is recognized for the treatment of both chronic and acute hypertension. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the extent of the antihypertensive effect of urapidil in various forms of general or regional anaesthesia. To this end, a retrospective analysis was first carried out on the typical reactions of the circulatory system in 200 patients during either neuroleptanalgesia with diazepam and droperidol, or halothane, enflurane or intrathecal local anaesthesia. In a prospective study, each of 5 normo- or hypertensive patients undergoing elective surgery with one of the aforementioned anaesthetic procedures received 50 mg urapidil intravenously 25-30 min after start of anaesthesia. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements were performed for up to 24 h after the injection. Whereas anaesthesia alone caused a moderate drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 3.1 and 2.1%, respectively (in normotensive patients), and of 12.0 and 6.7%, respectively (in hypertensive patients), urapidil caused a further significant fall in blood pressure in the hypertensive patients within a few minutes, but not in the normotensive groups. This effect was particularly pronounced under spinal anaesthesia and usually persisted until the end of the operation. Heart rate was (not significantly) increased for a few minutes after administration of urapidil. Temporary blood pressure reduction to hypotensive values was observed in 2 of the 50 patients only. From the results it is concluded that urapidil is an effective and relatively safe drug for the treatment of elevated blood pressure during routine surgery. Even if it has been administered on the basis of wrong indication (e.g. hypertensive phases as a result of insufficient anaesthesia), it rarely will cause blood pressure to fall to undesired low levels after anaesthesia has been normalized.",

    "29": "Adult (90-100 day-old) rats exposed prenatally (13-20 days of gestation) to diazepam (DZ) at 1.0, 2.5, or 10 mg/kg/day, were examined for functional deficits. Tests were designed to (1) correlate with known neural alterations induced by the prenatal exposure, or (2) to address the problem of developing tests of functional teratology in animals which have relevance to complex human functions. The careful selection of functional tests has disclosed several effects of prenatal DZ exposure on adult rat progeny. The dose-effect relationship was found to vary with the different tests, indicating that a thorough evaluation of the consequences of prenatal drug exposure necessitates utilization of several functional approaches. The results of these studies on the effects of prenatal exposure to DZ support the hypothesis that in utero exposure to drugs targeted for action on the central nervous system can induce long-lasting alterations on the neural substrates of behavior on the offspring with resulting functional consequences.", 
    "30": "The influence of minor tranquilizers (diazepam, meprobamate and beuactizine) on the hypothalamically elicited emotional responses was studied in chronic experiments on rabbits. The positive self-stimulation elicited from the lateral hypothalamus was facilitated by all used tranquilizers. On the first day of administration of the drugs the rate of self-stimulation increased markedly. The rate of self-stimulation was still mildly enhanced on the second day and returned to its initial value on the third day. The avoidance behaviour elicited from the medial hypothalamus changed to obvious self-stimulation after the administration of diazepam and meprobamate. The reversed behaviour preserved on the second day, while on the third day the animals resumed their avoidance behaviour. It was depressed by benactizine injection and some activation of exploratory behaviour was observed.", 
    "31": "In two patients (a married couple) the oral intake of 5 mg diazepam (Valium) per day (sometimes even more) over several years led to a homogeneous brown opacification of the lens under the anterior capsule over an area corresponding to the mean pupillary diameter.

    "32": "The purpose of this study was to develop a procedure for investigating the stability of drugs in biological fluids based on sound experimental design and to use a statistical procedure which would allow conclusions to be made concerning stability with an acceptable degree of certainty (95%). The experimental procedure involved replicate analysis of the drug in stored and freshly prepared samples on the same day. The relative difference in response between these two sets of samples and a 90% confidence interval for the true change in response was calculated. This confidence interval enabled us to detect a pharmacokinetically relevant degradation. It is argued that this approach is superior to the stability test procedures based on the t test. The application of the method to the assessment of the stability of three different drugs in biological fluids is described.", 
    "33": "Benzodiazepines have been reported to increase low rates of responding during a stimulus correlated with non-reinforcement while leaving prestimulus rates unaffected (successive discrimination). However, the results have been obtained by superimposition of the drug upon a discrimination which was learned in the absence of drug. The observed effects may therefore have been due to the sudden change in drug state (state-dependency) rather than to a specific action of the drug. The present experiments found that chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, IP) impaired acquisition but not performance of successive discrimination. Intermittent administration of chlordiazepoxide impaired discrimination by increasing low rates of responding during the stimulus signalling non-reinforcement. This effect was obtained with saline-drug but not drug-saline state changes (asymmetric state-dependency). A final experiment showed that chronic administration of the drug did reduce well-learned inhibition resulting from signalled shock. It was concluded that chlordiazepoxide has not only pure anxiolytic but also state-dependent effects and that if successive discrimination depends on conditioned frustration it does so only while the discrimination is being learned.", 
    "34": "A 49-year-old woman treated with cimetidine 300 mg tid for more than 18 months for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome experienced lethargy, dizziness, ataxia, and auditory and visual hallucinations after receiving triazolam 0.375 mg hs for sleep. Triazolam plasma concentrations were measured, and a triazolam elimination half-life was calculated to be approximately 8 hours (reported range 1.7-3 h). Cimetidine has been reported to decrease the apparent oral clearance of triazolam, resulting in increased triazolam plasma concentrations with the potential for exaggerated triazolam pharmacologic effects. Cimetidine may have been responsible for the unusually large elimination half-life in this patient. Until the mechanisms and clinical significance of this potential drug interaction are determined, clinicians should use the combination of triazolam and cimetidine with caution.", 
    "35": "Seventy-four habitual smokers who had refrained overnight from cigarette smoking and were undergoing elective orthopedic surgery were allocated randomly to two groups in order to investigate the effect of smoking two cigarettes before premedication on volume and pH of gastric contents. The smoking group was allowed to smoke two cigarettes while the non-smoking group was not allowed to smoke. There was no significant difference in volume or pH between the groups, either just after intubation or prior to extubation, thus indicating no decreased risk of acid pulmonary aspiration because of refraining acutely from cigarette smoking.", 
    "36": "Single dose pharmacokinetics of oxazepam, 30 mg, have been studied in six healthy male volunteers in the absence of diflunisal and during continuous treatment with diflunisal 500 mg twice daily. During diflunisal treatment, peak plasma concentration of oxazepam significantly decreased from 387 +/- 18 ng ml-1 (mean +/- s.e. mean) to 241 +/- 10 ng ml-1 and total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) significantly decreased from 5536 +/- 819 ng ml-1 h to 4643 +/- 562 ng ml-1 h. The AUC of oxazepam glucuronide significantly increased from 4771 +/- 227 ng ml-1 h to 8116 +/- 644 ng ml-1 h and its elimination half-life increased from 10.0 +/- 0.6 h to 13.0 +/- 1.0 h. Renal clearance for oxazepam glucuronide was significantly reduced from 74 +/- 2 ml min-1 to 46 +/- 3 ml min-1. In vitro, diflunisal, at concentrations of 125 to 1000 micrograms ml-1, significantly displaced oxazepam from its plasma protein binding, the free fraction of oxazepam increasing by 28 to 56%. The free fraction of oxazepam glucuronide, ex vivo, increased by 49 +/- 5% (n = 3) during concomitant diflunisal treatment. These data suggest that the observed interaction between oxazepam and diflunisal results from a presystemic displacement of oxazepam from its plasma protein binding sites by diflunisal and from an inhibition of the tubular secretion of oxazepam glucuronide by the glucuronides of diflunisal.", 
    "37": "Doses of the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and diazepam were selected that elevate, or that depress, exploratory and locomotor behaviour in the holeboard in mice, and the development of tolerance to these effects was investigated. Tolerance did not develop to the stimulant effects of low doses of these compounds after 10 or 20 days pretreatment with either a low (stimulant) dose or a high (depressant) dose of each. When animals were pretreated with a high (depressant) dose of the benzodiazepines, tolerance developed to the depressant effects of a high test dose, and in fact, after 20 days a stimulatory effect on head-dipping had developed with this dose. In contrast, however, after pretreatment with a high (depressant) dose, there was no tolerance to the stimulatory effects of a low test dose of the benzodiazepines, even after 20 days. The ability of current theories is concluded that behavioural theories of tolerance, such as an instrumental conditioning model, may be the most appropriate to explain the present results.", 
    "38": "Despite the widespread use of propoxyphene products as analgesics, there is no profile of a typical abuser of propoxyphene. Propoxyphene is structurally related to methadone and has central nervous system effects similar to those of opioids. The patient with dependence needs professional help in withdrawing from propoxyphene, in finding an alternative regimen for management of pain and in connecting with self-help programs focusing on life without chemical dependence.", 
    "39": "t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) is a bicyclophosphate derivative with potent picrotoxin-like convulsant activity that binds with high affinity and specificity to a Cl- channel-modulatory site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Using intact cerebellar granule cells maintained in primary culture, we have studied the modifications induced by GABA and diazepam on the ion channel-modulatory binding site labeled by [35S]TBPS. At 25 degrees C, and in a modified Locke solution, the [35S]TBPS specific binding, determined by displacing the radioligand with an excess (10(-4) M) of picrotoxin, was approximately 70% of the total radioactivity bound to the cells. [35S]TBPS specific binding was saturable with a Kd of approximately 100 nM, a Bmax of approximately 440 fmol/mg of protein, and a Hill coefficient of 1.18. Neither cerebellar astrocytes maintained in culture for 2 weeks nor a neuroblastoma cell line (NB-2A) exhibited any specific [35S]TBPS binding. Muscimol (0.3 to 5 microM) enhanced and bicuculline (0.1 to 5 microM) inhibited [35S]TBPS specific binding to intact cerebellar granule cells. The effect of muscimol and bicuculline on [35S]TBPS binding was noncompetitive. Muscimol (0.1 to 5 microM) reversed bicuculline inhibition in a dose-dependent fashion but failed to reverse picrotoxin-induced inhibition. [35S]TBPS binding was also modulated by benzodiazepine receptor ligands. The binding was increased by diazepam and decreased by 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methylester. Muscimol (0.05 microM) failed to reverse bicuculline inhibition in the absence of diazepam, but it became effective in the presence of 0.1 to 1 microM diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The efficacy of a rapid detoxification schedule (8 to 10 days) with clonidine or methadone was evaluated in 30 patients addicted to heroin. The dose of study drug was preestablished according to the subject's weight and the amount of opioid consumption, and the total daily dose was reduced by approximately 15% during the study. All subjects completed the detoxification program and stayed in the hospital for at least 12 days. Clonidine and methadone therapies proved to be highly effective. There was a marked reduction in anxiety during opioid detoxification, although subjects' experiences differed according to the drug used. On the day of discharge, subjects who had received methadone still had attenuated withdrawal symptoms, whereas there were no such symptoms in the clonidine group. Muscular aching, flatulence, and daily drowsiness were more common among subjects in the methadone group, while subjects in the clonidine group had more sleep disturbances and weeping. Syncopal episodes and bradycardia occurred more frequently in the clonidine group.", 
    "41": "For the continued availability of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in clinical practice on equal footing with other treatments, and without judicial interference, the following points are essential: ECT should be used or not used on the basis of scientific evidence and not because of public opinion or antipsychiatric propaganda. There should be no hesitation to use ECT in conditions where its omission would mean prolonged suffering, risk of suicide, or death from other causes (deep melancholic syndromes, acute lethal catatonia, psychogenic confusion). ECT should not be used where the effect is short-lived or must be paid at the price of an organic syndrome (schizophrenia, paranoid states, organic confusions). Efficiency should be optimal (oxygen, superficial narcosis, absence of benzodiazepines, generalized tonic-clonic seizures of at least 30-sec duration, maintenance treatment with antidepressive drugs). Safety should be optimal, not only for life but also for cerebral functioning (anesthesiological management, unilateral nondominant stimulation, pulse wave stimuli, appropriate number of treatments, not too closely spaced). The mechanism of action should be the object of further investigation. Such research will open possibilities for finding drugs that can compete with ECT.", 
    "42": "A 2750-g female infant was born at 36 weeks' gestation to a 40-year-old woman treated with clonazepam throughout her pregnancy. The infant developed apnea, cyanosis, and hypotonia within a few hours of birth. The mother's serum clonazepam level at delivery was 32 ng/mL; the cord blood level was 19 ng/mL. The infant had no congenital malformations, evidence of infection, or seizures. Clinical episodes ceased by ten days of age. The woman elected to breastfeed; breast milk clonazepam levels were between 11 and 13 ng/mL. She was discharged with a cardiorespiratory monitor. The authors suggest that infants of mothers receiving this agent during pregnancy or while nursing have serum levels measured. Additionally, these infants should be monitored for central nervous system depression or apnea.",

Her elimination half-life for desipramine was found to be greatly prolonged, at approximately 150 hours. Her ability to metabolize diphenhydramine and lorazepam was found to be impaired as well. Study of the elimination kinetics of desipramine in three of the patient's sisters provided some support for the existence of a genetically determined metabolic defect. Knowledge of those idiosyncratic pharmacokinetics had important implications for diagnosis and treatment in this case.",

    "46": "A double-blind study was performed in 83 patients with generalized anxiety disorder comparing daily doses of 5 and 10 mg ritanserin (a selective antagonist of serotonine S2 receptors) versus placebo and 4 mg lorazepam as reference drug. Patients treated with 10 mg ritanserin or 4 mg lorazepam improved significantly better (p less than 0.05) after two weeks than those treated with placebo. On the other hand a daily dose of 5 mg ritanserin appeared to be not superior to placebo. Patients treated with 4 mg lorazepam complained significantly more about sedation and dizziness than patients treated with 10 mg ritanserin (p less than 0.05).", 
    "47": "The possible development of a displacement interaction involving tolbutamide, in epileptic patients, has been explored by studying the serum protein binding of this drug in vitro in 199 samples of sera from patients treated with antiepileptic agents included in a programme of therapeutic drug monitoring. 82 of the samples were from patients receiving a single drug, 86 from patients treated with 2 drugs, and 31 from patients treated with 3 drugs. The free fraction of tolbutamide was higher in serum from patients treated with antiepileptic drugs than in serum from untreated 'normal' volunteers. The increase was more marked the greater the number of antiepileptic drugs administered. Valproate appeared to be the most powerful displacing agent.", 
    "48": "We reviewed the origins, the synthetic pathways and the biological properties of beta-carbolines, the condensation products of tryptophan and indole alkylamines with aldehydes. They were found in many plants, some of which have been used as hallucinogens. They also occur as minor constituents in tobacco smoke. In mammalian body, beta-carboline derivatives occur normally in plasma, platelets and urine, moreover it seems that some are formed in human body after alcohol intake. Due to interesting biological effects described in recent years (inhibition of monoamine oxidase, binding to benzodiazepine receptors, comutagenic and carcinogenic properties, 5-hydroxy tryptamine uptake inhibition), many attempts were made to prepare beta-carbolines starting from various indole derivatives. We reviewed the published methods up to 1975 and summarized the main patents related with pharmacological properties of synthetic beta-carbolines.", 
    "49": "Glucose and acetaldehyde react covalently with albumin to form the post-translationally modified group of proteins, the glycosylated albumins and the acetaldehyde albumins, respectively. This study contrasts the binding ability of a major acetaldehyde albumin fraction synthesized in vitro with glycosylated albumin. A microdialysis rate method, using either [14C]monoacetyldiaminodiphenyl sulfone (MADDS), a deputy ligand for bilirubin, or [14C]diazepam, was employed to evaluate binding at these two sites. Our results indicate that prolonged exposure of purified human serum albumin to acetaldehyde results in a major acetaldehyde albumin fraction that lacks the ability to bind MADDS and diazepam. This fraction migrates identically to albumin on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but exhibits microheterogeneity with a more acidic pI band as seen on analytical isoelectric focusing. We suggest that altered drug binding in alcoholics may be partially explained by altered binding ability of acetaldehyde albumins.", 
    "50": "Recent research indicates that physical exercise and fitness are new host factors with impact on hepatic drug metabolism, contributing to the intra- and interindividual variation in drug response. Moderate to heavy physical exercise for a few hours reduces liver blood flow as assessed by indocyanine green clearance, leading to a decreased elimination of drugs exhibiting flow-limited metabolism (high clearance drugs) such as lignocaine (lidocaine). However, hepatic elimination of drugs exhibiting capacity-limited metabolism (low clearance drugs) such as antipyrine (phenazone), diazepam and amylobarbitone (amobarbital) is not affected by acute physical exercise. Improved physical fitness as expressed by the maximum oxygen uptake seems to increase the elimination rate of the low clearance drug antipyrine and possibly also aminopyrine, while investigations of the biotransformation of high clearance drugs are contradictory. The sum of research in this recent field is rather limited and the mechanism whereby changes in physical fitness influence hepatic drug metabolism needs to be established. It is not known if other liver functions are changed. If the findings also apply for drugs with a low therapeutic index, there may be a risk of exercise-induced changes in drug efficacy and toxicity. It is suggested that future studies on host factors influencing drug metabolism should include information on physical activity.", 
    "51": "Recent evidence from experiments in animals suggests a rationale for more effective pharmacologic and physical therapy in patients with vertigo. In particular, one must consider the possible effects of medications on the adaptive processes that naturally mediate recovery from vestibular lesions. The challenge now is for clinicians to devise medication and exercise regimens for patients with vestibular disturbances and critically (and quantitatively) evaluate their effects.", 
    "52": "The effects of thiamylal and diazepam on the release of myoglobin and creatine phosphokinase following the administration of succinylcholine chloride during halothane anesthesia were studied. Thirty patients receiving halothane anesthesia were divided into three groups. In Group I, 1.5-2 mg/kg of thiamylal were given intravenously as pretreatment before the injection of succinylcholine chloride. In Group II, 0.3 mg/kg of diazepam were given and, in Group III, only succinylcholine chloride was injected. A significant increase in the serum myoglobin and creatine phosphokinase levels was observed in all groups. However, the values in Group I were significantly lower than those in Groups II and III and a significant difference was not detected between Group II and III. Our results indicate that thiamylal has a considerable inhibitory effect on the release of myoglobin and creatine phosphokinase from the muscle following the administration of succinylcholine chloride.", 
    "53": "The oral administration of pirenzepine (PRZ), an antimuscarinic agent, has a variable effect on gastric acid secretion in patients with duodenal ulcer, and it seems to potentiate cimetidine-induced inhibition of secretion. The possibility of a pharmacokinetic interaction between these drugs was examined in eight patients who received cimetidine and PRZ alone and in combination in a crossover fashion. Cimetidine, 600 mg b.i.d., PRZ, 50 mg b.i.d., or combination therapy were each given for 1 week before the study. Serum samples were serially drawn during each dosing interval for determination of cimetidine and PRZ concentrations by HPLC and RIA, respectively. Cimetidine given alone or with PRZ exhibited diurnal variation, as the peak serum concentration was lower after the nighttime dose than after the morning dose. PRZ showed intersubject variation. However, each drug failed to alter the pharmacokinetic indices of the other. The times to attain the peak serum concentration were not significantly different for cimetidine alone or with PRZ, arguing against an effect of PRZ on gastric motility in the doses we used. The greater and prolonged acid inhibition with the combination of cimetidine and PRZ, therefore, may stem from a synergistic action of both drugs on receptor sites on gastric parietal cells.", 
    "54": "The water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, was compared with diazepam for postoperative sedation in patients following cardiopulmonary bypass. Midazolam in repeated doses produced a stable plasma concentration within 4 h, showed no tendency to cumulation and was cleared rapidly following discontinuation. Similar doses of diazepam given with the same frequency produced plasma concentrations which were still increasing at the time of discontinuation and which were still greater than their baseline values 24 h later.", 
    "55": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam were studied in surgical patients given 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v. for either the induction of anaesthesia, or postoperative sedation following cardiopulmonary bypass. The short elimination half-life of midazolam (2.4 h in patients less than 50 yr undergoing minor surgery) was significantly, although not markedly, prolonged with age (4.1 h in patients greater than 50 yr undergoing minor procedures) and by the nature of the operation (3.8 h after major operative procedures). These changes were the result of alterations in clearance and volume of distribution with age, and in volume of distribution with nature of operation.", 
    "56": "Methyl mercury inhibits dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) uptake by brain synaptosomes and decreases antagonist binding to striatal dopaminergic D2 receptors in vitro. To assess the effects in vivo, adult rats were given methyl mercury, either as a single dose (10 mg/kg by gavage) or a cumulative total dose of 50 mg/kg in 2 weeks. The repeated dosing decreased body weight and caused neuromuscular dysfunction. In spite of this overt toxicity, neither 3H-DA uptake nor 3H-haloperidol binding changed in striatal synaptosomes. There were no significant alterations in 3H-5-HT uptake by hypothalamic synaptosomes or 3H-flunitrazepam binding in cerebellar synaptosomes. The results suggest that monoaminergic synapses and the benzodiazepine binding sites, associated with cerebellar GABA receptors, remain functionally normal at doses of methyl mercury that are otherwise toxic. The results also emphasize the importance of due care when extrapolating cellular or biochemical data to the level of the whole organism.", 
    "57": "Two fractions which inhibit benzodiazepine receptor binding were isolated from both rat and human urine. The method used involved alkaline methanolysis followed by chloroform extraction and silicic acid chromatography. This method precludes artifactual formation of esters of beta-carboline carboxylic acid (BCC) during the extraction procedure. One of the fractions (fraction E) behaved similarly to methyl ester of BCC on thin-layer chromatography and also had a similar fluorescent spectra. Administration of ethanol to male Sprague-Dawley rats decreased the concentration and the total excretion of both inhibitory fractions in a dose-dependent manner. In a clinical study on males with different family histories of alcoholism, ethanol decreased excretion of fraction E. The excretion was not affected by placebo, and it was similar in family history-positive and family history-negative subjects. These results suggest that ethanol affects the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex by changing release, metabolism, and/or excretion of an endogenous benzodiazepine ligand.", 
    "58": "Tifluadom (0.625-10.0 mg kg-1) was administered to non-deprived male rats which had been accustomed to eating a highly palatable diet in a 30 min test period. This compound, an opioid benzodiazepine, produced a significant increase in consumption of food when administered by the subcutaneous route, but not after intraperitoneal injection. Both chlordiazepoxide (1.25-20.0 mg kg-1) and the selective kappa opiate receptor agonist U-50,488 (0.3125-2.5 mg kg-1) also produced significant hyperphagic effects in the same feeding situation. In contrast, the two kappa opiate receptor agonists, ethylketocyclazocine (0.1-3.0 mg kg-1) and bremazocine (0.078-1.25 mg kg-1) brought about a dose-related suppression of food intake. Hence, the effects of kappa opiate receptor agonists in the feeding situation described here were not uniform. Furthermore, tifluadom could be likened either to a benzodiazepine or to a selective kappa receptor agonist. The hyperphagia induced by tifluadom was antagonized by naloxone, suggesting that the effect was mediated by an action at opiate receptors. It was not antagonized however by Ro15-1788 (10.0 and 20.0 mg kg-1), a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, ruling out possible mediation by benzodiazepine receptors. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, CGS 8216, exhibited intrinsic activity when administered alone, and significantly reduced food consumption in tifluadom-treated and control animals.", 
    "59": "The Stokes radii and the apparent molecular weights of the CHAPS or Triton X-100 solubilized benzodiazepine receptors are calculated by gel exclusion chromatography. The results suggest that the molecular receptor complex solubilized by CHAPS is much larger than the complex solubilized by Triton X-100.", 
    "60": "Zolpidem is a novel non-benzodiazepine related hypnotic, which possesses an imidazopyridine structure. This drug has preferential affinity for the 3H-diazepam binding site in the rat cerebellum, while it is only weakly active at inhibiting 3H-Ro 5-4864 binding to the rat kidney. The potency of zolpidem at displacing 3H-Ro 15-1788 binding to rat cerebral cortex membranes is enhanced in the presence of GABA. On the sleep pattern of the electrocorticogram in the curarised rat, zolpidem induces a physiological type of slow wave sleep with rapid onset of action. Zolpidem differs from classical benzodiazepine drugs, in possessing an atypical binding profile to 3H-benzodiazepine receptors, and because it does not affect the sleep patterns.", 
    "61": "The effects of drugs acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and other chloride ionophore-related sites have been studied for their ability to modulate the head-twitch induced by 1-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in the mouse. The GABAa receptor agonists, muscimol, imidazoleacetic acid and 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid, produced a dose-related potentiation, while bicuculline inhibited the head-twitch. The GABAb receptor agonist, baclofen, produced dose-related inhibition. Diazepam potentiated the head-twitch while the 'inverse' benzodiazepine receptor agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate inhibited the head-twitch. The antagonist Ro15-1788 also produced inhibition. Ro05-4864, a ligand for the benzodiazepine 'acceptor' site, potentiated the head-twitch. Pentobarbitone and pentylenetetrazol potentiated the 5-HTP-induced head-twitch at low doses, changing to inhibition as the dose was increased. Picrotoxin in subconvulsant doses, produced only potentiation. More than one site may be involved in the action of these substances. GABA, amino-oxyacetic acid and 1-2-4-diaminobutyric acid inhibited the head-twitch, while the GABA-depletor, 3-mercaptopropionic acid potentiated it. Of all the agents tested, only muscimol produced head-twitching when given alone. It was concluded that both GABAa and GABAb receptors modulate the head-twitch response to 5-HTP.", 
    "62": "The interactions of amitriptylinoxide and various antidepressant drugs with different neurotransmitter and drug receptors were investigated by receptor binding studies. Amitriptylinoxide had less affinity than amitriptyline for most of the receptors studied. Half maximal inhibition of acetylcholine receptor binding occurred for amitriptylinoxide at 18 mumol/l (amitriptyline: 0.32 mumol/l). Comparing all studied antidepressants for muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding, amitriptylinoxide had the weakest affinity of all tested tricyclic compounds. Also the affinity of amitriptylinoxide for alpha-receptor binding was about 60 fold less than that of amitriptyline. For all antidepressants investigated, the lowest affinities were found for benzodiazepine, opiate and beta-receptor binding. The weak affinities of amitriptylinoxide for various receptors may be responsible for its reduced side-effects, while it still retains potent antidepressant properties by stabilising the amitriptyline-level in the brain.", 
    "63": "The effect of carbamazepine on adenosine receptors in vitro has been well documented, with findings from several groups showing that therapeutic doses of this drug are sufficient to inhibit binding to the major portion of adenosine receptors in brain. In this study, we describe the effects of chronic carbamazepine on central adenosine receptors from several areas of rat brain using [3H]diethylphenylxanthine [( 3H]DPX) and [3H]cyclohexyladenosine [( 3H]CHA) as ligands. Carbamazepine was administered to rats orally in the diet at doses of 2.25 g/kg of diet and 5.0 g/kg of diet for periods of 3 and 11 days, respectively. Carbamazepine-treated animals displayed higher levels of adenosine receptors in virtually all brain areas tested, most of which reached significance in the 11-day treatment group. Scatchard analysis revealed increases in the number of receptors. There was no change in peripheral and central type benzodiazepine receptors or beta-adrenergic receptors in the carbamazepine-treated animals. Therefore, carbamazepine treatment in vivo appears to upregulate adenosine receptors, suggesting that this drug may act as an adenosine antagonist.", 
    "64": "We have examined the characteristics of various receptors in cat visual cortex during postnatal development. These included beta-adrenergic, GABA, benzodiazepine and acetylcholine receptors. For each population of receptor the number (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) were examined as a function of postnatal age (3 days-adult). For all receptors examined, the Bmax increased during development from low early values to a peak within the critical period. The Kd also changed during development for most receptors. The simultaneous alterations in Bmax and Kd necessitate defining a term which takes both of these receptor properties into consideration. This term, called receptor sensitivity (RS), provides a more comprehensive measure of receptor function than either Bmax or Kd alone. Using this measure, we find that receptor sensitivity is low near birth for the 4 receptor populations studied, rises to a peak within the first two months of life, and then declines to near-neonatal levels for 3 of the 4 receptor populations.", 
    "65": "A study was made of the density and affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres and hippocampus of rats with different predisposition to alcohol consumption. No differences were revealed in the parameters under study in animals with varying duration of ethanol anesthesia and in rats after voluntary consumption of ethanol for 3.5 and 10 months. In a state of abstinence rats with physical dependence manifested a dramatic decrease in the density and affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres. No changes described were detected in the hippocampus. The role of benzodiazepine receptors in the development of abstinence is discussed.", 
    "66": "4-t-Butyl-1-(4-bromophenyl)-bicycloorthocarboxylate antagonizes gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated relaxation at a functional insect nerve-muscle synapse, mimicking the action of picrotoxinin, suggesting that it causes GABA antagonism through blockade of the chloride ionophore. It is also a potent GABAA receptor antagonist, inhibiting the binding of [35S]t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) to EDTA/water-dialyzed human brain P2 membranes. Structure-activity relationships of 74 1,4-bis-substituted bicycloorthocarboxylates, mostly new compounds, reveal that for high potency as a GABAA receptor antagonist the optimal 4-substituent is a C4 to C6 branched chain alkyl or cycloalkyl group (e.g., t-butyl, s-butyl, or cyclohexyl) and the optimal 1-substituent is a phenyl moiety with one or more electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-cyano, 4-bromo, 4-chloro, 3,4-dichloro, or pentafluoro). Bicycloorthocarboxylate inhibitors of [35S]TBPS binding with IC50 values of 5-10 nM exceed by several-fold the potency of any GABAA receptor antagonist previously reported. The 4-t-butyl-1-(4-azidophenyl) analog, synthesized as a candidate photoaffinity label, gives an IC50 of 315 nM. The potency of bicycloorthocarboxylates for decreasing [35S]TBPS binding generally correlates with their toxicity, i.e., compounds without inhibitory activity in this brain receptor assay are of low toxicity on intraperitoneal administration to mice, and the analogs most potent as inhibitors are generally those most toxic to mice (e.g., IC50 of 5 nM and LD50 of 0.06 mg/kg for 4-t-butyl-1-(4-cyanophenyl)-bicycloorthocarboxylate). The effects of phenyl substituents on the potency of the orthobenzoates as GABAA receptor antagonists are similar to those on toxicity. In contrast to the 1-substituted phenyl compounds, 4-t-butyl-1-ethynyl-bicycloorthocarboxylate and its 4-i-propyl analog are very toxic (LD50 0.4-2 mg/kg) but have only moderate inhibitory potency (IC50 480-2900 nM), a pattern noted for many 1-alkyl-bicycloorthocarboxylates, suggesting that even within this series there may be different types of receptor-inhibitor interactions. 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-4-cyclohexyl-bicycloorthocarboxylate is particularly sensitive to oxidative detoxification based on its 10-fold synergism of toxicity by piperonyl butoxide and marked potency loss in a coupled [35S]TBPS receptor/microsomal oxidase assay. Some benzodiazepines and phenobarbital protect against poisoning by 1-(4-bromophenyl)- and 1-ethynyl-4-t-butyl-bicycloorthocarboxylates and their 1-(4-bromophenyl)-4-cyclohexyl analog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "A series of 3,6-disubstituted pyridazino[4,3-c]isoquinolines were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]diazepam to rat brain receptors in vitro. Compounds bearing a phenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, or methyl group at position 3 and a dialkylamino group at position 6 showed the highest affinity in the binding assay and were subsequently evaluated for their anticonflict and anticonvulsant effects. All of these compounds (5a-1 and 5q) were active in the Vogel rat conflict procedure, but none prevented convulsions in mice induced either by metrazol or bicuculline. 3-Phenyl-6-pyrrolidinylpyridazino[4,3-c]isoquinoline (5d) with a Ki = 11.4 nM in the binding assay exhibited the best potency in the anticonflict assay (MED 5 mg/kg ip) and did not produce neuromuscular impairment at the highest dose tested (50 mg/kg ip).", 
    "68": "This study evaluated the ability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), baclofen, monovalent anions, divalent cations, and various combinations thereof to protect solubilized benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors of types 1 and 2, when contained together on the complex, against heat inactivation. Neither anions, cations, nor GABA alone provided significant protection of solubilized BZ receptors against heat, but inclusion of monovalent anions or divalent cations together with 500 microM GABA did afford protection. Monovalent anions combined with GABA (500 microM) provided 50% to full protection. Divalent cations, such as CaCl2 (2.5 mM) or MgCl2 (2.5 mM) in the presence of GABA (500 microM) yielded 45% and 24% protection, respectively. Other divalent cations tested (Zn2+, Hg2+, Co2+, and Ni2+) were poor protectors, even when combined with GABA. Monovalent anions (200 mM NaCl) and divalent cations (5 mM CaCl2) when tested together provided no protection. Similarly, baclofen (the GABA-B agonist) provided no protection, either alone or together with anions or divalent cations. These results indicate that the independent but interacting recognition sites of GABA, BZ, anions, and divalent cations, previously detected in the membrane-bound state, are retained in the solubilized state.", 
    "69": "The effect of midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, on the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) following strong electrical stimulation of the upper lip, was investigated in Wistar albino rats. SEPs were recorded from the surface of the skull in the contralateral temporal area. A computer was used to obtain the averaged SEPs. The rats received intraperitoneal dosages of 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg of midazolam, or physiological saline. Relative amplitudes of the P(1)N(1) wave were reduced significantly after midazolam injection. Amplitude recovered to the control level about 120 min after the injection in the 1.25 mg/kg group. In 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg groups, midazolam-induced suppression did not recover within 120 min. No significant differences were found in the latencies of P(1) and N(1) before and after midazolam injection. It is suggested that midazolam has a mild analgesic effect due to central suppression of the pain perception following noxious stimuli.", 
    "70": "A study of the effects of sedation on arterial blood gases in patients undergoing cerebral angiography was performed. Twenty-one patients received pentazocine (30 mg) and midazolam (5-22.5 mg) and arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions were measured from radial artery samples before and during the procedure. A statistically significant rise in arterial carbon dioxide tension was demonstrated. It is suggested that this may cause a rise in intracranial pressure by increasing cerebral blood flow in a group of patients in whom there is a high incidence of raised intracranial pressure. The clinical significance of this increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension is discussed.", 
    "71": "The effect of anaesthesia induction drugs on the intestinal circulation was evaluated in an isolated loop preparation in 28 dogs. Selected intestinal loops were perfused with aortic blood by a pump at a constant pressure of 100 mmHg. A mixture of 86Rb and 9 microns spheres labeled with 141Ce was injected into the arterial cannula supplying the intestinal segment while mesenteric venous blood was collected for activity counting. Diazepam in a dose of 3 mg X kg-1 was accompanied by a significantly lower clearance (Cl-Rb), and permeability-surface area product (PS) than pentobarbitone; there were no differences between diazepam and pentobarbitone in total blood flow (BF), vascular resistance (VR) and oxygen consumption in the intestinal segments. Circulatory variable observed after midazolam, 8 mg X kg-1 and an additional 16 mg X kg-1, did not significantly differ from those seen during pentobarbitone. Ketamine in a dose of 8 mg X kg-1 was accompanied by a significantly lower BF, Cl-Rb, microsphere entrapment (Cl-Sph), PS, and higher VR and arterio-venous oxygen content difference. Sixteen mg X kg-1 of ketamine did not lead to any additional changes in determined variables of the intestinal circulation. Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade completely abolished vasoconstriction caused by ketamine, suggesting that the long-lasting vasoconstricting effect of ketamine on the intestinal circulation is mediated through catecholamines."
