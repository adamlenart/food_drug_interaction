    "0": "Local anesthetic techniques are often preferable to general anesthesia for bronchoscopies since these examinations are mostly undertaken as outpatient procedures. To be successful bronchoscopy under local anesthesia must satisfy three criteria: the technique used must produce adequate anesthesia: the procedure must be safe: and the technique should be easy for the patient as well as for the physician. Local anesthesia of the respiratory tract for these procedures can be achieved by laryngotracheal spraying or ultrasonic nebulizer administration of lidocaine. For fiberoscopic procedures lidocaine can also be administered through the fiberoscope. When the local anesthetic techniques are supplemented with light sedation, the procedure is easier and more acceptable to the patients. Using small doses of diazepam, flunitrazepam, or midazolam i.v. one can produce amnesia for the procedure and still discharge the patients 2 h after the procedure with a responsible adult. In many cases local anesthesia supplemented by intravenous sedation is a proper alternative and should be preferred to general anesthesia in ambulatory practice for diagnostic bronchoscopies.", 
    "1": "Toxicological analyses of blood and/or urine specimens collected between 1980 and 1981 revealed that 34.7% of all traffic accident victims (n = 144) had measurable concentrations of drugs. Analyses of blood samples taken from traffic offenders (n = 250) in 1979, on the other hand, showed 22.4% to have consumed drugs with or without alcohol. This percentage is comparable with values reported in other studies. Our results indicate that the widespread use of drugs represents a hazard for traffic safety in Switzerland. Road safety is additionally jeopardized by the often concomitant consumption of alcohol.", 
    "2": "Operant-conditioning methods were used to train rats to reach through an opening in an operant chamber to exert forces on a silent, nearly isometric force-sensing manipulandum. The reinforcement contingency required the rat to hold forelimb force at 20-50 g for a minimum of 2 s. Once established, this 'hold-in-the-band' behavior yielded three measures of performance (time on task, number of reinforcers, variance of in-band force). Variance of in-band force was presumed to reflect steadiness of forelimb control. Acute drug effects on the three dependent variables were assessed for dose ranges of haloperidol (HAL), chlorpromazine (CPZ), clozapine (CLZ), and chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Moreover, the effects of HAL (0.5 mg/kg) and CLZ (5.0 mg/kg) were examined in a subchronic (28 day) dosing regimen. The acutely administered neuroleptics (HAL, CPZ, CLZ) produced dose-related decreases in time on task and number of reinforcers, but did not significantly affect variance of in-band force. The subchronic paradigm produced similar results. CDP did not significantly affect variance of in-band force and the 5.0 mg/kg dose produced a slight, but non-significant increase in time on task while significantly decreasing number of reinforcers; a trend opposite to that seen for the neuroleptics, which produced parallel effects on these two measures. The results suggest that the neuroleptics impaired performance by affecting the tendency to initiate responding instead of affecting the capacity to maintain steady forelimb force once a response was started.", 
    "3": "The anxiolytic activity and tolerance of two dosage schedules of prazepam, a long plasma half-life benzodiazepine, were compared under double-blind conditions in two groups of 10 inpatients each who met Research Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and presented chronic and severe symptomatology. Patients received prazepam 40 mg per day on one of two dosage schedules: divided dosage (DD) - 10 mg in the morning and at noon and 20 mg in the evening; or single dosage (SD) - 40 mg in the evening. The 3 weeks of therapy were preceded and followed by 1 week of wash-out for baseline and follow-up assessments, which were performed weekly with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Clinical Global Impression, rating of morning drowsiness and evening worsening of symptoms, and patient self-rating of anxiety by means of a visual analogue scale performed both in the morning and in the afternoon. The results showed a clear superiority of the DD over the SD schedule: better anxiolytic efficacy on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (P less than 0.0005) and on both morning and afternoon visual analogue scales (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.0002); less morning drowsiness (P less than 0.0001); and steadier anxiolytic effect during the daytime, as globally rated by the investigator (P less than 0.0001) or measured by morning-afternoon differences on the visual analogue scale (P less than 0.005). These results suggest that plasma pharmacokinetics alone may not be sufficient to predict the duration of benzodiazepine anxiolytic activity.", 
    "4": "Placental transfer of pinazepam and its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam was investigated in 25 pregnant women at term. Pinazepam was administered orally as a single (10 mg) dose to 13 women, or in multiple doses of 5 mg daily to 12 women. The dose-delivery interval ranged between 1 and 26 h for the single dose, and the period between the last of the multiple doses and delivery was 1.4 to 24 h. Pinazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam were measured in plasma obtained from the umbilical vein and from the mother, at delivery. Pinazepam was only detectable in plasma after the 10 mg dose. The drug did not reach an apparent equilibrium between fetal and maternal plasma. The average (+/- SEM) cord/maternal ratio of plasma pinazepam concentrations was 0.64 +/- 0.07. N-desmethyldiazepam was detectable on each occasion. Its concentration in the plasma from the cord vein became higher than that in the maternal specimens 1-2 h after administration of the parent drug. Little N-desmethyldiazepam was excreted in breast milk.", 
    "5": "A new series of 2,3-cyclopentano-3,4-dihydro-4-spirocyclopentano-1,5-benzodi azepine which are substituted in 5-position with beta-N-heterocycloethyl or gamma-N-heterocyclo-n-propyl groups have been synthesized and evaluated for their CNS depressant activity including anticonvulsant, analgesic and pentobarbital induced hypnosis. These compounds were also investigated for their ability to inhibit in vitro succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). In most of the compounds an appreciable CNS depressant activity has been found to be associated with the compounds possessing good SDH inhibitory activity. Low toxicity of these compounds was reflected by their high approximate LD50 values.", 
    "6": "The possibility of a role for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in seizure disorders has been strengthened by biochemical studies showing that various nervous system depressant drugs can modulate GABA receptor binding in vitro. In particular, two classes of anticonvulsant agents, the benzodiazepines and the barbiturates, have modulatory receptor sites on the GABA receptor-ionophore protein complex of the postsynaptic membrane. Furthermore, it is well established that direct block of GABA function causes seizures and that augmentation of GABA function can protect against seizure activity. Direct evidence for altered GABA synaptic markers has been obtained in some animal models of epilepsy, as well as in human focal epilepsy. We present preliminary evidence for a deficit in benzodiazepine receptor binding in the midbrain of seizure-susceptible Mongolian gerbils. These data would be consistent with an impairment of GABA-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission that contributes to susceptibility to the genesis or spread of seizures in some kinds of epilepsy.", 
    "7": "Calmodulin is a major Ca2+ -binding protein that may mediate many Ca2+ -regulated processes in neuronal function. Calmodulin is present in the presynaptic nerve terminal in association with synaptic vesicles and in postsynaptic density fractions. Several calmodulin-regulated synaptic biochemical processes have been identified. These results indicate that calmodulin may modulate some aspects of neuronal excitability. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and the benzodiazepines inhibit Ca2+ -calmodulin-regulated protein phosphorylation and neurotransmitter release by synaptic vesicles. A saturable, stereospecific membrane binding site has been identified for the benzodiazepines. The potency of the benzodiazepines to bind to these sites correlates with their ability to inhibit maximal electroshock-induced seizures. Phenytoin and carbamazepine can displace benzodiazepine binding from these binding sites. Binding to these \"anticonvulsant\" sites regulates Ca2+ -calmodulin-stimulated membrane protein phosphorylation and depolarization-dependent Ca2+ uptake in intact synaptosome preparations. These results provide evidence that major anticonvulsant drugs regulate Ca2+ -calmodulin systems at the synapse. Kindling alters Ca2+ -calmodulin protein phosphorylation in brain membrane. In addition, alterations in Ca2+ -calmodulin kinase systems have been associated with some strains of seizure-susceptible mice. Thus, evidence from multiple sources suggests that calmodulin-mediated processes may play a role in the development of altered neuronal excitability and in some forms of seizure disorders.", 
    "8": "The effect of pirenzepine--a selective antimuscarinic compound--on plasma catecholamine, serum gastrin and somatostatin concentrations was studied in duodenal ulcer patients. Plasma concentration of noradrenaline decreased significantly after injection of pirenzepine (10 mg intravenously), whereas the circulating levels of adrenaline, dopamine, gastrin and somatostatin remained unchanged. The results may be explained by a decreased activity in postganglionic sympathetic ganglia. This is in line with the recent observation in vitro that pirenzepine effectively blocks muscarinic receptors in some sympathetic ganglia.", 
    "9": "Buspirone is a clinically effective anxiolytic with a unique structure and pharmacology which distinguishes it from the benzodiazepines. It has been termed anxioselective because it lacks anticonvulsant, sedative, or muscle-relaxant properties. Preclinical evidence suggests it lacks potential for abuse or physical dependence and interacts minimally with CNS depressants such as alcohol. Rather than working through traditional benzodiazepine mechanisms, buspirone affects diverse aspects of the brain's neurochemical circuitry. For example, it exerts potent influences on the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems, the dorsal raphe serotonergic system, and the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system. Although without direct receptor interaction, potentiation of cholinergically mediated behavior and involvement with GABAergic neurotransmission have also been demonstrated.", 
    "10": "This literature review addresses two related questions: Is buspirone as clinically effective an antianxiety agent as the benzodiazepines? And does buspirone offer any safety advantages? Data from over 1,000 anxious outpatients reveal that an average dose of 20 mg of buspirone/day appears to be as effective an antianxiety agent as comparable doses of diazepam or clorazepate in both acute and more chronic administration studies. Buspirone appears to cause less clinically significant impairment in cognition or motor performance, is less likely to potentiate the effects of brain depressants like alcohol, has little if any abuse liability, and produces no clinically identifiable physical abstinence syndrome when discontinued after long-term administration. While the final answer on the clinical usefulness and side effect profile of this interesting drug awaits the results of its use in divergent clinical settings, this new antianxiety agent appears to be equally effective in treating anxiety but is safer than the benzodiazepines.", 
    "11": "The present series of experiments had two main objectives: The first was to determine the conditions under which self-injection of the benzodiazepine diazepam would be optimal; the second was to identify neurochemical substrates which underlie the maintenance of diazepam self-administration. Data from the first experiment indicated that rats maintained on an FI-1 (Fixed Interval of 1 min) schedule of food delivery self-injected significantly more diazepam than rats not maintained on this schedule. Results from the second experiment demonstrated that the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, and the GABA antagonist bicuculline, significantly reduced diazepam self-administration, but the opiate antagonist naloxone was without effect. Data from the third experiment showed that the dopamine antagonist haloperidol also significantly reduced the rate of diazepam self-injection. Thus, these findings indicate that the acquisition of diazepam self-injection occurs under an FI-1 schedule of food delivery, which has been shown to be middly stressful, while its maintenance depends upon the functional integrity of benzodiazepine and GABA receptors and upon the activity of dopaminergic pathways.", 
    "12": "Concentration-response curves of bethanechol were obtained from isolated guinea pig gastric fundus and gastric circular smooth muscle strips before and after exposure to pirenzepine or atropine. In the presence of pirenzepine and atropine these curves were shifted parallel to the right with no change in maximum response. Against bethanechol, mean pA2 values were 7.06 for pirenzepine and 8.16 for atropine on gastric fundus, with slopes of Schild plots close to unity for both antagonists, whereas in the case of gastric smooth muscle pA2 values were 6.52 for pirenzepine and 8.52 for atropine, with the slope of the Schild plot significantly less than -1 in the case of pirenzepine. The values of the Schild slope seem to indicate that pirenzepine interacts with a single, apparently homogeneous population of muscarinic receptors on gastric mucosa, at variance with the behaviour of pirenzepine on receptors of gastric smooth muscle.", 
    "13": "A double-blind, crossover study was carried out in 126 out-patients, most of them neurotics, to compare the efficacy and tolerance of bromazepam and placebo. Patients received either 6 mg bromazepam or placebo daily for 3 weeks and were then crossed over to the alternative treatment for a further 3 weeks. Treatment sequence was randomized. Clinical ratings of the severity of individual symptoms and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale were used to measure response to treatment at the end of each period. During the first period, both bromazepam and placebo produced improvement and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. During the second period after crossover, however, significantly better results were achieved in patients on bromazepam than those on placebo. The incidence of side-effects, mainly drowsiness, was similar with bromazepam and placebo.", 
    "14": "Majority of adult male albino random-bred mice housed singly or in small groups show agonistic behavior on interaction with a strange male mouse: some of them are predominantly aggressive ('aggressive' mice) while others show defenses or escapes even though their partners are not aggressive ('timid' mice). The remaining males not exhibiting agonistic behavior ('sociable' mice) show more social investigation then aggressive or timid mice and more locomotion then timid mice. Active defensive-escape behavior ('timidity') and inhibition of social investigation and of locomotion is much stronger in an unfamiliar cage with a strange male than in a home cage or on interaction with a female. Effects of 50 drugs on behavior of aggressive and timid male mice on agonistic interactions with non-aggressive male mice in neutral cages were tested. Most of the drugs possessing anxiolytic activity in man reduced active escapes or defenses at doses lower than those inhibiting attacks or locomotion and increased social investigation while most drugs without anxiolytic activity did not show these effects. Some anxiolytic drugs reduced tail-rattling (an ambivalent activity presumably reflecting both attack and escape tendency) at doses lower than those reducing attacks and increased locomotion. Only some benzodiazepines (nitrazepam, oxazepam and diazepam) produced the whole spectrum of these effects indicating a reduced defensive-escape tendency. The present results suggest that a selective inhibition of defensive-escape tendency on agonistic interactions can be a good predictor of anxiolytic activity of drugs. Profiles of effects of seven benzodiazepines in the present model of agonistic interaction to some extent differed: triazolam, clonazepam and flunitrazepam were more sedating (reduced timidity only at doses inhibiting locomotion) while nitrazepam, oxazepam, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were less sedating (reduced timidity at non-sedative doses, stimulated social investigation and locomotion). Only drugs stimulating GABA-receptor complex (benzodiazepines, barbiturates and GABAergic drugs) inhibited active escapes and defenses at doses lower than those reducing attacks. This suggests that the GABA-receptor complex is involved in regulation of defensive-escape tendency in intraspecies conflict.", 
    "15": "The influence of a benzodiazepine (triazolam) on the body temperature of poor sleepers during nights disturbed by airplane noises has been examined. Subjects were divided into 3 groups each of 8 men. Following a double-blind design, Group A (controls) received a placebo for 6 consecutive nights, Group B received 0.25 mg triazolam, and Group C received 0.5 mg triazolam on nights N3, N4 and N5. On all other nights Group B and C subjects received placebo. For all 3 groups, nights N3 and N5 were disturbed by 32, semi-randomly distributed airplane noises. Air and wall temperatures (To = 20 degrees C), and air humidity (Tdp = 10 degrees C), were kept constant. Rectal temperature and 4 local skin temperatures were recorded from each subject. Urine samples were collected each morning for measurement of cortisol and catecholamine levels. Noise was found to cause an increase in body heat storage, but only in Group A. Both drug groups showed impairment of body heat balance. The hypothermic action of triazolam could be explained both by a central action of the drug on the thermoregulatory controller and by a peripheral action on blood vessels.", 
    "16": "The effects of acute i.p. administration of lithium (2 mmol/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg) and dl-propranolol (2 mg/kg) on brain Na+-K+-ATPase activity in mice exposed to two stressful stimuli (cold and immobilization) were examined. In unstressed mice, lithium and propranolol did not affect the enzyme activity, while diazepam increased it. Interestingly, all the three drugs reversed the stress-induced increase in the brain Na+-K+-ATPase activity. The specificity of this action remains to be clarified.", 
    "17": "During the last years, there have been more and more observations of physical dependence on the benzodiazepines. This paper emphasizes the seriousness of this syndrome, its similarity with delirium tremens and its optimal treatment by high doses of benzodiazepines. This article shows also the misuse of drugs lowering the epileptogenic threshold and suggests in replacement the peranaesthesic administration of benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Finally the treatment should be started with a gradual and slow withdrawal so as to avoid undesirable neurological signs.", 
    "18": "The staircase test consists of placing a naive mouse in an enclosed staircase with five steps and observing the number of steps climbed and rearings made in a 3-min period. All the clinically active anxiolytics tested (chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, meprobamate, phenobarbital) reduce rearing at doses which did not reduce the number of steps climbed. The majority of non-anxiolytic substances tested (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, imipramine, amitriptyline, amphetamine, morphine and carbamazepine) produced a parallel reduction of both behavioural variables. Ethosuximide had no effect on behaviour. The anticonvulsant sodium valproate produced an anxiolytic profile in this test, since it reduced rearing, while increasing step climbing. This result confirms the anxiolytic properties of valproate observed in other behavioural models. Our results indicate that the staircase test in mice is simple, rapid and selective for anxiolytics. The test is well suited for use as a primary screening method.", 
    "19": "This study compared the effects of single nightly doses of flurazepam 30 mg and temazepam 40 mg upon both the subjective assessment of sleep quality and performance on 3 tests of mental efficiency 10 h following medication. 12 male and 12 female non-smoker subjects took part, none of whom experienced sleep difficulties. In comparison with their respective placebos, both hypnotics produced marked and significant improvements in the quality, depth and duration of sleep, and reduced the difficulty that the female subjects experienced in getting to sleep. Flurazepam also produced a significant increase in satisfaction with sleep together with significant reductions in the number of awakenings during the night and the level of clearheadedness on waking. The major test of performance was a continuous 20-min rapid visual information processing task. It was found that for both sexes during each of the two consecutive 10-min periods of performance flurazepam produced highly significant residual impairments in both the speed of reaction and the accuracy of detection, while temazepam had no effect. Overall the results indicate that flurazepam produces a wider range of improvements in sleep quality than temazepam at the cost of less clearheadedness on waking and residual impairments in sustained rapid information processing.", 
    "20": "The pharmacokinetics and the metabolism of tetrazepam (Musaril) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. Tetrazepam was given orally as a single dose of 50 mg in tablet form (commercially available formulation). Tetrazepam and nortetrazepam were measured in serum using a selective and sensitive HPLC method. Urinary metabolites were identified after acid hydrolysis and thin-layer chromatographic separation. Tetrazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a lag-time of 0.45 +/- 0.10 h and reaches a peak serum level of 0.57 +/- 0.06 mg/l at 1.92 +/- 0.19 h after administration. The drug is largely distributed in the organism with an apparent volume of distribution of 225 +/- 40 l. The substitution of the phenyl moiety in the 5-position by a cyclohexenyl ring results in a different metabolism when compared to other benzodiazepines. This different metabolic pathway is the reason why only very small levels of active metabolites are present in serum. Therefore it seems reasonable, at least from the pharmacokinetic point of view, to attribute pharmacologic activity of tetrazepam mainly to the parent drug. Tetrazepam is eliminated with a half-life of 14.9 +/- 4.4 h and can be classified as a benzodiazepine with medium half-life value. This medium half-life is the result of the high hepatic clearance of the drug in spite of its large distribution volume. Since in this study 6 male and 6 female volunteers were studied it was possible to compare the pharmacokinetic profile in the two groups. No significant differences were observed.", 
    "21": "More than 40 drugs are known to increase muscle relaxation, to aggravate myasthenia gravis, or to induce myasthenic syndromes in \"normal\" individuals with or without a known impaired safety factor. Many of these drugs have been known for a long time. In the last ten years some other drugs have been added to the long list: Penicillamine, beta-adrenergic blockers, carnitine, some antibiotics, lithium carbonate, catharactics containing magnesium salts, etc. An immunological basis for the penicillamine-induced myasthenia gravis is generally approved, but there may be other examples such as trimethadione and phenytoin. The knowledge of these possible side effects is important for the interpretation of unwanted effects, particularly diplopia and other mild myasthenic symptoms.", 
    "22": "Ten rotating shift workers, who changed shifts every 1 to 4 weeks, slept in the laboratory during the first four daytime sleep periods of two consecutive tours of night shift. Prior to the first two sleep periods of one tour, the subjects were given 0.5 mg triazolam. Placebo was administered prior to sleep periods one and two of the other night shift tour. Neither drug nor placebo was given before the third and fourth sleep period of either tour of night shift. Conditions were counterbalanced among subjects. Polysomnography demonstrated that triazolam significantly increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency relative to placebo, primarily by promoting sleep maintenance. No adaptation to daytime sleep was seen during the four consecutive sleep periods without triazolam (placebo, then no drug). Triazolam did not appear to promote adaptation to daytime sleep on the 2 days following triazolam administration.", 
    "23": "A male marihuana user with amotivational syndrome who responded poorly to neuroleptic therapy was treated four times with weekly intramuscular injection of caerulein in a dose of 0.6 micrograms/kg. He was maintained on his previous neuroleptic medication during the study period. The BPRS was used to rate the patient's symptoms. There were remarkable improvements in the total scores and the psychosis subscale score, which consists of the following symptoms that do not respond well to neuroleptic therapy in chronic schizophrenia: emotional withdrawal, mannerisms and posturing, uncooperativeness, and blunted affect. These improvements persisted for two weeks after cessation of caerulein administration, after which the patient's condition gradually worsened. Nevertheless, the improvement recurred upon reinjection of caerulein. These findings indicate that the improvement observed seems to be due to caerulein, and suggest that caerulein may be a useful and effective therapeutic drug for marihuana user with amotivational syndrome.", 
    "24": "This paper, based on a review of the literature, evaluates the risks to infants of maternal drug use during lactation. The potential harm of a particular drug to the breastfed infant is related both to the complex mechanism of milk synthesis and secretion and the mode of passage of the drug from plasma into milk. The 1st part of the paper discusses mammary cell and milk synthesis, milk secretion and composition, the mode of passage of drugs into milk, and factors influencing drug concentrations in milk. Drug concentrations in milk are dependent on 6 major factors: drug dosage, proportion bound in plasma, molecular weight, lipid solubility, degree of ionization, and pH difference between plasma and milk. Drugs that are weak acids are ionized to a greater extent and are more protein-bound than weak alkaline drugs. The 2nd part of the paper evaluates the risks to breastfed infants of selected pharmacons. Some categories of drugs that contain pharmacons that should be limited or avoided by nursing mothers are alkylating agents, analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, anti-infective agents, central nervous system stimulants, hormones, laxatives, minerals, provitamins, psychotherapeutic agents, thyroid affecting agents, and vitamins. The following precautions are suggested to minimize the risks of potentially harmful pharmacons: 1) all unnecessary medications should be avoided by nrusing mothers; 2) if medication is necessary during lactation, drug dosage should be controlled and the infant should be monitored for adverse symptoms; 3) drugs should be administered shortly after breastfeeding and the interval prolonged before the next feeding; and 4) if the infant must be fed soon after a potentially harmful drug has been taken by the mother, bottle feeding is recommended.", 
    "25": "The plasma profile of lormetazepam has been determined in sixteen clinically healthy, adult male volunteers following 1 mg lormetazepam, administered either sublingually or by the oral route. Absorption of lormetazepam was found to be rapid following both sublingual and oral administration. While a trend was observed towards a more rapid rate of absorption after sublingual dosing, statistically, there was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) between the speed with which lormetazepam was absorbed following sublingual and oral dosing. After absorption, plasma lormetazepam levels rapidly reached mean (+/- s.d.) peak concentrations of 4.9 +/- 0.9 ng/ml and 5.2 +/- 1.7 ng/ml for the sublingual and oral routes, respectively, there being no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) between these values. Likewise, there was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in the times at which peak plasma levels were attained in the two groups. Furthermore, measurement of the area under each plasma concentration-time curve showed that the bioavailability of lormetazepam was the same for the two routes of administration. Elimination of lormetazepam followed a similar pattern following sublingual and oral dosing, the mean terminal half-lives being 13.0 h and 13.8 h, respectively. The findings in the present study clearly indicate that the plasma profiles of lormetazepam attained on sublingual and oral dosing are similar, indeed the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this drug appear identical being independent of its route of administration.", 
    "26": "Differences among various benzodiazepines in onset and intensity of action after single oral doses are not attributable to differences in blood brain barrier permeability. When given parenterally all benzodiazepines rapidly enter brain tissue and have a rapid onset of action, indicating that passage from blood to brain is not the rate-limiting factor (Arendt et al. 1983). Rather it is the difference in rate of absorption - passage from the gastrointestinal tract to systemic blood - that largely determines the onset of action after single oral doses. This difference in absorption rate in turn depends on the relative lipophilicity as well as the characteristics of the pharmaceutical formulation. There are benefits and disadvantages associated with rapid as well as with slow absorption profiles, depending on the clinical situation and the patient's expectations and particular pattern of drug sensitivity. The suggestion that a drug \"works promptly but does not produce initial euphoria\" is contradictory, since rapid absorption is the mechanism for both of these effects.", 
    "27": "It is still insufficiently recognised that hypnotics and anti-anxiety drugs are one and the same and that the regular intake of these drugs will be followed by withdrawal phenomena, including complaints of insomnia and anxiety. The long-acting, cumulative drugs like phenobarbitone or flurazepam cannot in reality be withdrawn abruptly owing to their persistence in the tissues, and so they do not cause sharp rebound phenomena, though they cause impaired skills and judgement by day. Very short life drugs, like triazolam, are followed by immediate and severe withdrawal insomnia in older people and their regular nighttime intake may cause regular daytime withdrawal symptoms of enhanced anxiety. A hypnotic with a half-life of about 10 hours may be the most sensible compromise to provide sleep by night without serious positive or negative daytime effects, though some eventual withdrawal features will be inevitable. The benzodiazepines lead to a degree of tolerance, but this is never complete and their positive effects are sustained over many months. Increased sleep duration has been assumed to be a necessary feature of an effective hypnotic. However, hypnotic drugs for the future might not lengthen sleep, but improve it's restorative value and the subjective satisfaction given to the patient.", 
    "28": "The daytime performance efficiency of 12 elderly subjects of average age 81.5 years (range 75-96 years) was examined in a cross-over study following lormetazepam 1 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg, and placebo capsules nightly for 7 nights. Performance was assessed on the Gibson spiral maze, and a reciprocal tapping task. In both tasks the speed and the accuracy of performance were independently measured. Performance testing sessions were conducted on the morning following the first, and the morning following the seventh dose of each of the three experimental treatments. Performance on the Gibson spiral maze showed no significant effect of either of the active drugs. On the reciprocal tapping task, speed was similarly unaffected by both drugs. However, while neither drug significantly affected overall accuracy after the first dose, nitrazepam but not lormetazepam significantly impaired overall accuracy after seven consecutive doses. This difference between nitrazepam and lormetazepam was significant. Further analyses showed nitrazepam consistently to be associated with impaired accuracy at both intermediate and high levels of task complexity. Lormetazepam, on the other hand, was associated with impairment only at the highest level of task complexity. The overall pattern of impairment associated with nitrazepam, but not with lormetazepam, was consistent with drug accumulation.", 
    "29": "Lormetazepam is a new benzodiazepine hypnotic. Previous work has indicated that lormetazepam has an intermediate to short elimination half-life, i.e. in the range of 5-15 h. Hence, in older patients, the drug should be safe and hypnotically active in doses equal to or less than the doses recommended for young adults. The present study tested this hypothesis. We studied ten healthy subjects, aged 55 and older, with both subjective and objective insomnia. Subjective insomnia was the complaint of requiring at least 45 min to fall asleep and sleeping less than six and a half hours per night. Each complaint was present on at least 50% of the nights for at least three months. Objective insomnia was measured polysomnographically and was present on at least two of the last three nights of four consecutive nights of placebo baseline. The study involved a design in which treatment was administered in a double-blind fashion. Each subject was studied for 14 consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. The drug was administered for seven consecutive nights which were preceded by a placebo baseline and followed by a placebo period of drug withdrawal. On each laboratory night subjects were monitored by continuous, all-night conventional EEG/EOG/EMG recordings. Each laboratory morning subjects completed a questionnaire on which they rated six characteristics of their sleep on the previous night. At study entry and again at study end, each subject had a physical examination by a Board internist and clinical laboratory tests. Each laboratory morning and evening subjects had a screening physical exam and completed an 11-item hypnotic drug side-effect questionnaire and a 56-item review of medical systems questionnaire. Compared with the median baseline night, on the median drug night lormetazepam 0.5 mg significantly increased total sleep time by about 25 min. The drug's reductions of sleep latency were substantial. In addition, lormetazepam 0.5 mg significantly decreased number of awakenings. No objective evidence was found of either tolerance developing to the hypnotic efficacy of lormetazepam 0.5 mg or of rebound insomnia.", 
    "30": "54 healthy volunteers took part in 3 placebo controlled double-blind trials designed partly as crossover, partly as parallel group studies. The long-acting (elimination half-life greater than 24 h) test drugs diazepam (DIA 5; 10 mg) and flurazepam (FLU 30 mg) were compared to the short-acting drugs (elimination half-life less than 12 h) lormetazepam (LOR 1.5; 2 mg) and mepindolol sulfate (MEP 10 mg; betablocker) following acute or subchronic application. Alcohol (ALC; 0.4-0.8 per mill blood ALC concentration) was used as a compound interfering with the test drugs. Measurements with the driving simulator TS2 were taken at different times between 1 h and 15 h p.a.", 
    "31": "Subchronic use of FLU causes significant impairment of driving performance the next morning in contrast to LOR which even increases the driving ability. The ALC potentiating effect of LOR is larger than that of DIA after acute intake. MEP acts like placebo but reduces blood pressure and heart rate. Interaction of LOR and ALC in the evening does not result in a prolonged hangover effect which could disturb driving performance the next morning.", 
    "32": "Short-acting benzodiazepines without active metabolites have a profound advantage over those with long-acting accumulating characteristics in respect to matutinal car driving ability, if those drugs are used as nighttime hypnotics. These results highlight the necessity of screening hypnotic and tranquilizing drugs concerning their influence on car driving performance at different times after intake and under conditions of interactions with psychotropic drugs, especially alcohol. In view of future methodological requirements a revised model of driving simulation is presented. It is based on a coherent description of the system \"driver-vehicle environment\" at the level of visual conditions, vehicle behaviour and driver performance. Preliminary data are shown.", 
    "33": "The effects of flunitrazepam 1 mg, triazolam 0.25 mg, lormetazepam 1 mg and placebo on stages of information processing in a Sternberg memory scanning task were investigated in ten normal volunteers. Overall reaction times for the task were increased 1 h following treatment with triazolam and both 1 h and 10 h following treatment with flunitrazepam. Response latencies were not appreciably altered by lormetazepam or placebo. The effects of flunitrazepam and triazolam were found to be localised in the stimulus encoding and serial comparison stages of the reaction process and not in response-selection organisation.", 
    "34": "Sixteen healthy men, age 18-35, each received lormetazepam (1.5 mg), flurazepam (30 mg), temazepam (30 mg) and placebo (double-blind in a Latin Square design) 30 min before bedtime for 2 consecutive nights followed by a 12 day washout between conditions. Three hours after drug (2.5 h after bedtime) subjects were awakened and administered a 16-item memory task. Fifteen minutes after the awakening subjects returned to bed, were instructed to go to sleep, and remained in bed for an additional 5.5 h. Immediately after the memory tasks, before returning to bed, subjects recalled almost all of the 16 items when placebo was administered before bedtime. Immediate recall was significantly poorer than placebo after temazepam and flurazepam, but not after lormetazepam. Morning recall was reduced significantly from the immediate nighttime level in each condition; this loss was smallest with placebo. All active drug conditions produced significantly greater amnesia than placebo. This amnesia was smallest after lormetazepam and greatest after temazepam, which differed significantly from each other. All active drugs significantly reduced latency measures of the return to sleep after the 15 min awakening; it was shortest with temazepam and longest with flurazepam. This study showed a relation between the hypnotic and amnesic effects of these drugs which is consistent with their pharmacokinetic properties.", 
    "35": "Here we compared the efficacy of two electrophysiological techniques in detecting hangover effects after repeated administration (five days) of benzodiazepines. Twelve hours after the last ingestion, possible effects on evoked potentials (EPs) of the long- and short-acting benzodiazepines, flurazepam and lormetazepam, were compared here with those of placebo under a double-blind experimental condition. The EPs were recorded from occipital and parietal sites during an active discrimination of two amoeboid shapes and passive viewing of sine-wave grating patterns turned on and off. In the former task, the subject was requested to make a selective response with respect to whether the two shapes appeared the same or different and his reaction times were simultaneously recorded. Neither benzodiazepine influenced the latencies of any of the sensory and late EP components. Flurazepam's long-acting metabolite, N-desalkylflurazepam, reduced the amplitudes of all the EP components suggesting a somewhat general mode of action. This was not the case for lormetazepam. N-desalkylflurazepam reduced the amplitudes of the occipital visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to sine-wave gratings to a greater extent than the amplitudes of the late parietal EPs to amoeboid shapes. This effect did not show any particular preference for either of the subsystems processing pattern and movement information. The amplitudes of the late EP components, such as N200 and P300 waves recorded from parietal sites, were reduced considerably more after flurazepam administration than their counterparts recorded from the occiput. This observation points to the possible existence of at least two separate sources of the N200-P300 complex with different affinities to the N-desalkylflurazepam. The flurazepam-induced amplitude reduction observed for VEPs to gratings may reflect an attenuation in the detectability of both pattern and movement. The attenuation of the late EP amplitudes is possibly a function of several processes, one of which is conceivably the anxiolytic property of flurazepam which lowers the level of the activation state and this in turn is known to contribute to the amplitude size of the N200-P300 complex.", 
    "36": "The recent development of short-acting benzodiazepines without active metabolites calls for a differentiation between the hangover effects of long-acting (LBD) and short-acting (SBD) benzodiazepines, when used as nighttime sedatives. The question now arises as to which electrophysiological and psychometric tests can record these effects with the highest degree of sensitivity.", 
    "37": "35 healthy volunteers participated in 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies. In the first 2 studies the short-acting benzodiazepine (LORMetazepam 2 mg), the medium-acting BD (FLUNitrazepam 2 mg) and the long-acting BDs (FLURazepam 30 mg and DIAZepam 10 mg) were administered in single oral doses at bedtime. Hangover was measured in the morning hours prior to administration, and 12, 36, and either 60 h (first study) or 156 h (second study) p.a. The measurements included the pharmaco-EEG, particularly the relative power in the beta band; visual analogue scales for assessing the subjective quality of sleep, EWL-adjective check list; pegboard test and radioreceptor assay. In the third study, a single oral dose of LORM 2 mg was given and the acute sedative effects were measured by the Adaptive Pursuit Tracking Test, Pauli memory test, pegboard and Pursuit Rotor.", 
    "38": "The sleep-inducing properties of all BDs could be detected quite clearly on the first night p.a. Distinct hangover effects of LBD were apparent in the pegboard test and residual effects in different beta frequency bands after the first and, to a lesser degree, second nights. Such effects were barely detectable after the SBD. The time course of the RRA plasma levels of LORM and FLUN corresponded well to that of behaviour. The correspondence for DIAZ was less clear. The pharmaco-EEG proved to be the most sensitive measure of benzodiazepine effects, followed by continuous performance measures, such as the pursuit tracking test and driving simulator. Relatively low discriminability was observed with the discontinuous psychomotor tests, such as pegboard. These results have been interpreted within a concept of \"activation theory\" and it has been concluded that benzodiazepines more likely affect higher central nervous activities, such as the level of vigilance and attention, than simple activities, such as visumotor performance.", 
    "39": "Since the presence of benzodiazepine (BD) receptors was demonstrated in mammalian brain tissue, simple, sensitive and rapid techniques have been established to use BD-receptor preparations for specific radioreceptor assays (RRA). The RRA allows in vitro estimations of receptor affinity and concentration of BD in biological material, e.g. the time course of total BD binding activity in plasma (parent compound and active metabolites) may be evaluated. Several studies in volunteers with short and long-acting BD used as sedatives and hypnotics including diazepam (DZP), flunitrazepam (FNZ), flurazepam (FZP), lormetazepam (LMZ), oxazepam, temazepam and triazolam indicate that pharmacokinetic data (e.g. elimination half-lives of receptor active compounds) concur with the results obtained from other methods, if active metabolites are taken into account. For the evaluation of BD long-term and hangover effects in two placebo controlled double-blind studies (placebo vs. 1 mg and 2 mg LMZ, 2 mg FNZ, 30 mg FZP, 10 mg DZP) BD-binding equivalents and pharmaco-EEG recordings, subjective state, psychomotor as well as cognitive function were determined by standardized methods up to 154 hours following drug administration. Compared to placebo a distinct long-lasting increase in the relative power in beta-frequencies (12.5-30 Hz) and an impairment of psychomotor performance could be evidenced up to 12 h following FNZ and FZP intake. These effects correspond to the BD-binding activity in plasma. These findings indicate that BD-receptor preparations as used for the RRA are valuable tools to investigate binding affinities and pharmacokinetic properties of BD. Plasma levels of RRA active material may reflect a better correspondence to some clinical effects of BD than levels of the parent compound alone.", 
    "40": "60 anxious neurotic outpatients completed a double-blind comparative 2 week clinical study of the anxiolytic effect of melperone 10 mg t.i.d. and 25 mg t.i.d. versus placebo. The efficacy was assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Clinical Global Impressions. At the end of the 1st and the 2nd week of treatment, the reduction in the Hamilton scores was significantly greater in the melperone groups than in the placebo group, but there was no significant difference in the improvement of the two melperone groups. Similar findings were true for the global assessment. The adverse effects recorded were generally mild and transient, tiredness being the most frequent in both the placebo and melperone groups. No laboratory abnormalities were attributable to melperone. A nonsignificant reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the melperone groups, probably due to the antianxiety effect. It is concluded that melperone, in low doses, appears to be both safe and effective as an antianxiety agent. The results indicate that melperone could be a realistic alternative to the benzodiazepines.", 
    "41": "A multicentre, parallel group hospital study was carried out in 190 subjects with insomnia to compare the efficacy, incidence of hangover and the side-effects of loprazolam and nitrazepam. Following 2 nights single-blind phase on placebo, loprazolam (1.0 mg), nitrazepam (5.0 mg) or placebo was administered double-blind for 7 consecutive nights. Visual analogue scales and questions were used to rate efficacy. There was no statistically significant difference between loprazolam and nitrazepam for 'ease of getting to sleep', 'restfulness of sleep' and 'depth of sleep'. Like nitrazepam, loprazolam diminished the number of periods of wakefulness and made it 'easier to get to sleep again'. Subjective evaluation showed that hangover was not a feature of loprazolam. It did not affect morning alertness and patients thought they had improved balance and co-ordination while on this drug. These findings are in keeping with the evidence of other workers who have shown only minimal psychomotor impairment, if any, with loprazolam (1.0 mg). There was no statistically significant difference between treatments with respect to frequency or incidence of side-effects.", 
    "42": "Pinazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, differs from other drugs of its class by the presence of an unsaturated bond, the propargyl group, at the N-1 position. Its toxicity is less than that of diazepam. In animals, pinazepam controls anxiety and aggressiveness. This effect seems to be associated with a particularly low hypnotic effect and with a limited impairment of motor coordination. Pinazepam shows less cortical activity at the anxiolytic level than does diazepam on EEG. The drug's mechanism of action primarily involves modification in the region of the limbic system. Extensive pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated rapid gastrointestinal absorption of pinazepam. The metabolic pathway is N-1 dealkylation and C-3 hydroxylation. In dogs, pinazepam reaches the steady state in one day and its main metabolite, depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam) in six days, thus achieving a much higher blood concentration than the parent drug. In rabbits, a first-pass effect is evident. Both compounds are converted to oxazepam, which is pharmacologically inactive and is eliminated in the urine. Pinazepam and depropargylpinazepam cross the placenta and appear in human milk. In dogs, accumulation could not be demonstrated at the end of treatment with 10 mg of pinazepam for 20 days. All the findings in animals were confirmed in humans. In clinical trials with open or controlled design, pinazepam, compared with diazepam, showed a significant and purely anxiolytic action in patients suffering from anxiety with or without somatic manifestations, particularly in gastrointestinal disorders. Even though it is not a specific hypnotic drug, it seems to help patients in whom the physiological course of the sleep is disturbed. The standard dosage is 10 mg daily, divided in two doses. Pinazepam is well tolerated in humans. About 5% of patients experience mild sedation. Other side effects are infrequent and minor. In the studies there was no evidence of impairment of motor coordination or of intellectual performance. There were no reports of a rebound phenomenon or drug dependence. These findings indicate that pinazepam is a pure anxiolytic agent devoid of hypnotic effect or motor disorders, characteristics that make it a useful drug for daytime use.", 
    "43": "Amino acids provide the most universal and important inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine) and excitatory (glutamate, aspartate, cysteic acid, cysteine sulphinic acid) neurotransmitters in the brain. An anticonvulsant action may be produced (1) by enhancing inhibitory (GABAergic) processes, and (2) by diminishing excitatory transmission. Possible pharmacological mechanisms for enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition include (1) GABA agonist action, (2) GABA prodrugs, (3) drugs facilitating GABA release from terminals, (4) inhibition of GABA-transaminase, (5) allosteric enhancement of the efficacy of GABA at the receptor complex, (6) direction action on the chloride ionophore, and (7) inhibition of GABA reuptake. Examples of these approaches include the use of irreversible GABA-transaminase inhibitors, such as gamma-vinyl GABA, and the development of anticonvulsant beta-carbolines that interact with the \"benzodiazepine receptor.\" Pharmacological mechanisms for diminishing excitatory transmission include (1) enzyme inhibitors that decrease the maximal rate of synthesis of glutamate or aspartate, (2) drugs that decrease the synaptic release of glutamate or aspartate, and (3) drugs that block the post-synaptic action of excitatory amino acids. Compounds that selectively antagonise excitation due to dicarboxylic amino acids have recently been developed. Those that selectively block excitation produced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (and aspartate) have proved to be potent anticonvulsants in many animal models of epilepsy. This provides a novel approach to the design of anticonvulsant drugs.", 
    "44": "The effects of diazepam on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol and metoprolol) and a hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (atenolol) were compared in 12 subjects. Administration of propranolol and metoprolol produced small increases in the AUC0-8h for diazepam compared with placebo (P less than 0.05 for metoprolol). Atenolol had no significant effect on the AUC0-8h for diazepam. The increase in the AUC0-8h was accompanied by increases in the plasma concentrations of N-desmethyldiazepam. Diazepam had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either propranolol or atenolol. The pharmacokinetic interaction could be attributed to inhibition of diazepam metabolism by the lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The pharmacodynamic studies showed that when compared with placebo or atenolol there was a significant impairment of kinetic visual acuity (KVA) when diazepam was co-administered with metoprolol. Although there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.02) between plasma concentrations of diazepam and impairment of KVA, the pharmacodynamic interactions may not be due solely to the small pharmacokinetic interaction observed.", 
    "45": "Although the press claimed there were dramatic increases in the use of tranquillizers in Northern Ireland after the outbreak of civil unrest in 1969, our data, based on the computerised pricing system for drugs prescribed in the province, showed average annual increases of about 20% from 1966 to 1969, and 10% from 1970 to 1975, thereafter tranquillizer prescribing levels reached a plateau and declined between 1979 and 1980. Total psychotropic drug use also reached a peak in 1975, when about 12.5% of the adult population were estimated to have been receiving such a drug, and declined in the following 5 years. Benzodiazepines accounted for three-quarters of all psychotropic drugs and 98% of tranquillizers prescribed in 1980. Benzodiazepine tranquillizer prescribing has consistently been 20-30% higher than the rest of the United Kingdom, in contrast to hypnotic and antidepressant prescribing which has been consistently lower. The rate of increase in benzodiazepine tranquillizer prescribing over the decade from 1966 was greater than in other European countries, overtaking the level in Norway in 1972 and has since remained third to Iceland and Denmark. Some possible demographic and socioeconomic determinants of these trends are discussed. The prescribing of benzodiazepine hypnotics was almost entirely explained by these variables.", 
    "46": "The availability of radiolabeled benzodiazepines has resulted in the identification of high affinity receptors in the central nervous system for this class of psychotherapeutic agent which are linked to recognition sites for the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. Evaluation of new, synthetic compounds in the benzodiazepine radioligand binding assay has resulted in the identification of nine classes of non-benzodiazepine putative anxiolytic agents, some of which may be more anxioselective than the benzodiazepines. At least three and possibly five subclasses of benzodiazepine receptor have been identified in mammalian tissues using radioligand binding assays. The possibility exists that one of these receptor subclasses may mediate the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepines while the remainder may be involved in the mediation of the sedative, ataxic and anticonvulsant properties associated with benzodiazepine-like agents. Several endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor(s) have been postulated. These include various proteins and peptides, purines and the beta-carbolines. This latter group, which competitively antagonizes the pharmacological and biochemical effects of the benzodiazepines, has the highest affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor of all compounds thus far examined; however, none of these compounds has been conclusively identified as the endogenous ligand akin to the enkephalins and endorphins at the opiate receptor. The majority of available evidence would indicate that the endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor(s) is an antagonist of the benzodiazepines and other putative anxiolytic agents.", 
    "47": "Taking a population of women most of whom were about to seek medication from their general practitioner for stress-induced insomnia, this sleep laboratory study examined--both electro -physiologically and psychologically--the immediate impact of temazepam, at normal prescribed dosage, on sleep. The study was double-blind, controlled with random allocation. Temazepam 20 mg, prepared as a liquid in a soft gelatin capsule, reduced sleep latency and prolonged total sleep time. A reduction in stage shifts to Stages I and II and a reduction in time spent in Stages 0 + I suggest more restful sleep. The sleep \"architecture\" (including REM/NREM cycling, total SWS and REM time) was relatively undisturbed. Temazepam would seem to be effective as a first-line hypnotic for short-term use in stressed patients.", 
    "48": "The effects of acute administration per os of 30 mg camazepam and the same dose of temazepam, were compared with placebo in 8 young male volunteers, fully adapted to the laboratory environment by 6 nights of adaptation. The study was double-blind, in a random order, 10 days separating each session. Spectral analysis was performed on the all-night records (1-min epochs), and the relative power of six frequency bands calculated. Concerning sleep parameters, temazepam induces a statistically significant reduction of: phase shifts; number of awakenings; percent duration of sleep stages I and IV. A significant increase of the percent duration of stage II and sleep efficiency was also found. Camazepam shows modification, with the same trend, but not reaching statistical significance. Concerning spectral analysis, temazepam induces a light increase of the relative power of the slowest frequencies, paralleled by an increase of the fast bands, while major effects are found on the characteristic periodicity of delta activities, which appear disrupted by the drug. These effects are not evident with camazepam, which does not seem to distort the normal sleep pattern.", 
    "49": "Sixteen healthy volunteers, aged 19 to 62 years, took a single 20-mg oral dose of clobazam and the serum concentrations of clobazam and desmethylclobazam were measured for the following 7 days. The mean kinetic variables for clobazam were: volume of distribution 1.31/kg, elimination half-life 24h, total clearance 0.47 ml/min/kg. 13 of the volunteers then took clobazam 5 mg twice daily for 22 consecutive days. Serum concentrations were measured during and after this period. Both clobazam and desmethylclobazam showed slow and extensive accumulation, their steady-state kinetics being entirely consistent with those observed after single doses. Elimination of both compounds after termination of treatment was equally slow. Clinical self-rating of morning sedation indicated a significant increase over baseline in subjective perception of sedation during the treatment period, and this effect persisted into the washout period. However, sedation did not increase in parallel with accumulating levels of clobazam and desmethylclobazam, probably due to functional adaptation or tolerance.", 
    "50": "Fourteen, healthy students volunteered for a double-blind, cross-over trial of temazepam 20 mg (soft gelatine capsule), nitrazepam 10 mg (uncoated tablet) and placebo in matched formulations, single doses of each being given for 10 nights with a three-week wash-out period between each treatment. Residual drug effects were measured objectively (psychomotor skills) and subjectively (visual analogue scales) in the morning and afternoon of Days 0 (before the first tablet), 1 and 10. The subjects also recorded various events during each treatment period. Serum benzodiazepine concentrations were bioassayed in blood samples taken after the last assessment. Both benzodiazepines shortened sleep latency during the first few nights, and nitrazepam prolonged the duration of sleep. The residual effect of drowsiness was noted during the nitrazepam period, whilst temazepam proved less sedating. The 'morning after' effect was a subjective observation and not an objective measurement. The learning effect interfered with the complex objective assessments, and simple measurement of exophoria with the Maddox wing test provided the clearest objective evidence of drug effects. On Day 10 residual concentrations of nitrazepam were detectable in the serum whereas the level of temazepam was found to be low or negligible. It is concluded, that temazepam 20 mg in a soft gelatine capsule is a suitable hypnotic for subjects whose daily work requires constant alertness.", 
    "51": "Behavioral and biological issues in agoraphobia are reviewed. New classifications of agoraphobia based on longitudinal studies appear promising. Genetical studies bring some data suggesting that agoraphobia and panick attacks may be a familial and genetical disease. The effects of antidepressants on agoraphobia and panick attacks are still a disputed issue. Exposure in vivo appears as the effective component of behavioral treatment of anticipatory anxiety and allows a significant withdrawal of medication (eg antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine). A personal study on 27 agoraphobia cases is reported showing a significant rate of withdrawal after behavior therapy (p less than .05). Some examples of single case designs are reported to study the covariation of depression, phobia and panick attacks. Multicenter studies are needed to clarify the problem of effectiveness and specificity of antidepressant action on agoraphobia and panick attacks.", 
    "52": "Dependence to benzodiazepines is difficult to induce in animals but has been induced by high doses in man. Case reports of benzodiazepine dependence are rare compared with the usage of these drugs, but provide no proper epidemiological framework for the estimation of risk. Patients taking these drugs for four months or more may develop symptoms on withdrawal, characterized by anxiety, dysphoria, malaise, depersonalization, and by perceptual changes such as hyperacusis and unsteadiness. In our first study we compared four patients withdrawing from high doses of benzodiazepines with six patients withdrawing from therapeutic doses. In all patients the typical withdrawal syndrome was noted and was equal in intensity in both groups. In the second study, long-term, normal-dose benzodiazepine treatment was discontinued in 24 patients believed to be dependent on their medication. The withdrawal was gradual, placebo-controlled and double-blind. All experienced some form of withdrawal reaction, which ranged from anxiety and dysphoria to moderate affective and perceptual changes. Symptom ratings rose as the drugs were discontinued, but usually subsided to pre-withdrawal levels over the next two to four weeks. Electroencephalograhic (EEG) changes comprised marked reduction in fast-wave activity as the drugs were withdrawn, and an improvement in psychological performance was noted. It is concluded that a risk of dependencies present in all patients taking benzodiazepines even in therapeutic doses for more than a few months. Caution is urged in the prescribing of these drugs.", 
    "53": "Tissue homogenates were prepared from brains of four week old Lewis rats. 5HT receptors were prepared from three brain regions and labelled with 3H-5HT and 3H-spiperone. Alpha-receptors were prepared from rat forebrains and labelled with 3H-WB4101 and 3H-clonidine. Incubations were carried out at seven concentrations for each of twelve benzodiazepines. IC50 values were derived from specific binding versus log (drug concentration) plots. The benzodiazepines appeared to have little affinity for 5HT or NA post-synaptic receptors in rat brain.", 
    "54": "Acute injections of benzodiazepines produce sedative effects in the rat that can be detected by decreases in spontaneous motor activity and exploration. The effects are found with low doses, are dose-related and correlate well with plasma concentrations. With repeated daily doses there is tolerance to the sedative effects within 3-5 days even with benzodiazepines with short half-lives and no active metabolites. In the rat there may be some pharmacokinetic tolerance accounting for some of the behavioural tolerance, but pharmacokinetic changes cannot explain the tolerance to low doses of chlordiazepoxide. With chronically treated rats there is no relationship between plasma benzodiazepine concentrations and sedation. There is rapid recovery from tolerance to the sedative effects and if the animals are tested undrugged there is no detectable effect 24 h after the last dose. Anxiolytic effects emerge after a few days of benzodiazepine treatment, but after 10-20 days of treatment there is tolerance to these effects in the social interaction test and in the corticosterone-stress response.", 
    "55": "An animal behaviour model is described in which the exploratory activity of weanling rats in an area inaccessible to the mother rat is measured by ultra sound. The model distinguishes between benzodiazepines and amphetamine or desipramine when the drugs are given acutely to the weanlings. Flurazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam and chlordiazepoxide produced a dose-dependent increase in exploratory behaviour and a reduction of activity at higher doses. Chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide in the diet of the maternal rat also produced an increased exploratory activity in the weanlings. Diazepam and oxazepam were without effect at the doses used. It is proposed that this model has value in assessing anxiolytic activity in acutely or chronically administered benzodiazepines.", 
    "56": "Methods for benzodiazepine analysis are briefly discussed and the pharmacokinetics of the benzodiazepines reviewed. Studies of the relationship between plasma concentration and anxiolytic response have produced conflicting results. Routine monitoring in anxiety states is not warranted. Some specific indications for monitoring are in elderly patients; in cases of suspected non-compliance; in patients with renal and hepatic disease. The relationship between plasma concentration and ECG changes following benzodiazepine overdose showed that monitoring was of little value in these cases.", 
    "57": "A single blind study was planned to investigate whether benzodiapines would reduce androgens in women with idiopathic hirsutism. Placebo was given for the first month followed by four months of a benzodiazepine (chlorazepate 15 mg nocte or diazepam 10 mg nocte ). Plasma samples were collected during the follicular and luteal phases of each therapy month. Hair growth was assessed monthly. Eighteen women concluded the five months of the trial of whom ten received chlorazepate and eight diazepam. Comparison of follicular plasma samples during the placebo phase and fourth month of benzodiazepine found a significant increase in sex hormone binding globulin and a significant decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate with benzodiazepine therapy. No significant effects on hair growth were observed. A longer therapy time may be needed to demonstrate effects of benzodiapines on hirsutism. Further studies are needed to determine whether benzodiazepines affect hormonal parameters in normal men and women.", 
    "58": "Nine poor sleepers of mean age 61 years were studied while they took loprazolam 0.5 mg, loprazolam 1 mg and triazolam 0.5 mg for 3-week periods. Loprazolam 1 mg and triazolam 0.5 mg increased sleep duration, but there was some tolerance to both, particularly triazolam, by the 3rd week. Withdrawal of either drug led to sleep significantly shorter than baseline. This rebound effect was significant greater than withdrawing triazolam. After withdrawing loprazolam 1 mg, the rebound was maximal on the 3rd night and after withdrawing triazolam it was maximal and severe on the 1st night. In the third week of use neither drug was associated with late-night wakefulness. Total overnight urinary cortisol was lower during drug intake and there were significant withdrawal rebounds to above baseline levels, immediately so after triazolam.", 
    "59": "Twelve poor sleepers of mean age 52 years performed 2 h of laboratory tests three times on 1 day during each week of nightly intake of loprazolam 0.5 mg, loprazolam 1 mg, triazolam 0.5 mg, or continued placebos. Only in the mornings did loprazolam 1 mg cause impairment in manual dexterity and card-sorting, and triazolam 0.5 mg in manual dexterity. Using difference from baseline, withdrawal of either drug after 3 weeks was associated with poorer subjective quality of sleep than following continuing placebos. The rate of spontaneous complaints (including accidents) associated with the drugs was as informative as formal testing.", 
    "60": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (0, 5, 15 mg/kg) on eating latency, eating time and amount eaten of familiar and novel foods by rats were assessed. Familiarity with the test apparatus and procedure increased feeding but reduced responsivity to chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Food deprivation increased feeding and responsivity to 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide but attenuated some sedative effects of 15 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide. Preference for familiar food was shown only by food-deprived, test-experienced rats. The time devoted to eating novel food, but not the amount eaten, was increased by chlordiazepoxide. These findings are discussed in the context of anxiolytic and appetitive interpretations of benzodiazepine effects on hyponeophagia , with the conclusion that reduction in apparatus neophobia largely accounts for the results observed.", 
    "61": "5 patients with chronic renal failure on maintenance hemodialysis and 5 healthy matched controls received single 20-mg intravenous doses of clorazepate dipotassium. Clearance of pharmacologically active unbound desmethyldiazepam was reduced in renal failure patients as opposed to controls, and free fraction in serum was greater. Since desmethyldiazepam distribution was reduced in renal patients, elimination half-life was actually shorter than in controls (36 vs. 57 h). In 10 dialysis patients receiving chronic diazepam treatment (5-15 mg/day), steady-state concentrations of diazepam (56 ng/ml) and desmethyldiazepam (77 ng/ml) were significantly lower than in age- and weight-matched controls receiving similar doses (189 and 216 ng/ml, respectively). However after correction for the higher free fractions of both compounds in renal patients as opposed to controls, steady-state concentrations of unbound drug were found to be similar between groups. Interpretation of kinetic variables and steady-state serum concentrations of extensively protein-bound drugs requires consideration of alterations in protein binding that may occur in disease states.", 
    "62": "In 14 schizophrenic patients, treated with neuroleptic drugs, and in 7 patients, treated with high-dosage diazepam, beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity in plasma has been measured by use of a highly sensitive and relatively specific radioimmunoassay. Neuroleptic treatment induced a significant increase of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-ELI). The pharmacological and clinical implications of this finding are discussed. High-dosage diazepam treatment induces a slight reduction of plasma beta-ELI, a finding which is attributed to antistress effect of diazepam.", 
    "63": "A review of available information about the pharmacokinetics of pro-nor-diazepam-like compounds in the elderly shows substantial impairment of the metabolism compared to oxazepam-like benzodiazepines, which are metabolized with virtually no change in this age group. Results of clinical trials point in the same direction, although small numbers of patients, different criteria for measuring clinical benefit and adverse reactions and different dosages for various periods of time make the comparison difficult. Qualified clinical guidelines are mainly to reduce dosage and use oxazepam-like compounds in the elderly, but routine clinical practice does not seem to apply these recommendations. Further research is therefore needed, mainly in the area of clinical practice, to describe the 'real' situation of benzodiazepine prescription for in-patients and out-patients in terms of risk-benefit ratio of drug treatment and to monitor the changes occurring when a more rational approach is introduced as regards the need for treatment, dose and duration of treatment.", 
    "64": "Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions which involve currently available benzodiazepines may be classified into two major categories: interactions which affect benzodiazepine rate of absorption, and interactions which affect clearance and, therefore, elimination half-life. Ethanol is the prototype for absorptive interactions. Concurrent ethanol use and oral ingestion of benzodiazepine derivatives uniformly slows the rate but does not change the extent of benzodiazepine absorption. Interactions which affect benzodiazepine clearance affect only those derivatives which are oxidatively metabolized or cleared as a function of hepatic blood flow (high first-pass clearance). Conjugated benzodiazepines are not implicated in such interactions. Rifampin and chronic ethanol use induce benzodiazepine oxidation, while cimetidine, oral contraceptives, ethanol (acute ingestion), disulfiram, isoniazid, and propranolol inhibit benzodiazepine oxidation. In addition, ethanol, cimetidine and isoniazid decrease first-pass hepatic extraction of triazolam, enhancing its systemic availability and decreasing oral clearance. The pharmacokinetic consequence of induction of benzodiazepine oxidation is higher clearance and decreased steady-state concentrations during chronic dosing. Conversely, inhibition of benzodiazepine oxidation decreases clearance and increases steady-state benzodiazepine concentrations during chronic dosing. Because a correlation of benzodiazepine plasma concentration and pharmacological effect is not established, the pharmacodynamic consequences of these interactions are not currently well characterized.", 
    "65": "Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions which involve currently available benzodiazepines may be classified into 2 major categories: interactions which affect benzodiazepine rate of absorption, and interactions which affect clearance and, therefore, elimination 1/2-life. Ethanol is the prototype for absorptive interactions. Concurrent ethanol use and oral ingestion of benzodiazepine derivatives uniformly slows the rate but does not change the extent of benzodiazepine absorption. Interactions which affect benzodiazepine clearance affect only those derivatives which are oxidatively metabolized or cleared as a function of hepatic blood flow (high 1st pass clearance). Conjugated benzodiazepines are not implicated in such interactions. Rifampicin and chronic ethanol use induce benzodiazepine oxidation, while cimetidine, oral contraceptives, ethanol (acute ingestion), disulfiram, isoniazid, and propranolol inhibit benzodiazepine oxidation. In addition, ethanol, cimetidine and isoniazid decrease 1st pass hepatic extraction of triazolam, enhancing its systemic availability and decreasing oral clearance. The pharmacokinetic consequence of induction of benzodiazepine oxidation is higher clearance and decreased steady state concentrations during chronnic dosing. Conversely, inhibition of benzodiazepine oxidation decreases clearance and increases steady state benzodiazepine plasma concentration and pharmacological effect is not established, the pharmacodynamic consequences of these interactions are not currently well characterized.

    "66": "Large differences exist among the various benzodiazepines with regard to their pharmacokinetic properties and metabolism in man. Some are eliminated from the body at a relatively slow rate, e.g. desmethyldiazepam, and others are metabolized rapidly, e.g. midazolam, triazolam. Several benzodiazepines have major active metabolites that are slowly eliminated, e.g. medazepam, halazepam , quazepam and, consequently, should be considered as potentially long-acting. Such differences may be very important clinically because pharmacokinetic data will help to optimize drug therapy with respect to the choice of the proper drug and drug preparation, as well as with the choice of a proper dose and dosage regimen. The therapeutic objectives of drug therapy differ quite considerably for the various clinical indications of benzodiazepines. In anti-anxiety and anti-epileptic therapy, prolonged or continuous treatment is pursued, so that compounds with relatively long or intermediate elimination half-lives of parent drug or active metabolites are of advantage. In hypnotic treatment, on the other hand, the duration of drug action should be restricted to the duration of the night, hence a compound with a short elimination half-life may be preferred. An overview is given of the pharmacokinetics of the major benzodiazepines currently available and of some interesting new ones that are still in the development stage.", 
    "67": "A series of studies has been carried out using a choice procedure to investigate the reinforcing properties of benzodiazepines in adult volunteer subjects. Amphetamine and other drugs with undisputed dependence potential are clearly preferred by the majority of subjects using this procedure. However, diazepam has not been found to be an effective reinforcer across a range of doses, using various subject populations and under different experimental conditions. In the present study, lorazepam, a benzodiazepine with a shorter half-life than diazepam, was tested. Twelve normal volunteer subjects were tested in 4 separate experiments in which three doses of lorazepam (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg) were each compared to placebo, and in a separate experiment, 1.0 mg lorazepam was compared to 5.0 mg diazepam. Subjects showed no preference between 0.5 mg lorazepam and placebo or between 1.0 mg lorazepam and 5.0 mg diazepam, but at the 1.0 and 2.0 mg doses of lorazepam they showed a clear preference for placebo. Subjective effects of the drugs were also monitored, and showed changes consistent with the anxiolytic and sedative effects of the drugs. The duration of the effects of lorazepam was unexpectedly long (as long as 6 hours), so the question whether a shorter-acting benzodiazepine would be a more effective reinforcer in this situation remains unanswered.", 
    "68": "A national survey of psychotherapeutic drug use was carried out in the U.S.A. in 1979. Data were obtained from a probability sample (n = 3161) of adults in the general population, using a clinically-oriented interview lasting an average of 90 minutes. The data provide estimates of the prevalence of using anxiolytic and other psychotherapeutic medications. Among users they also provide detailed descriptions of patterns of use and characteristics associated with various patterns of use. The study found that 11% of American adults used an anxiolytic during the 12 months prior to the survey. Benzodiazepines accounted for 84% of the anxiolytics mentioned. The analyses compared (i) users of anxiolytics with non-users and (ii) three groups of anxiolytic users classified according to pattern (frequency and regularity) of use. The results were generally consistent with an illness treatment model of psychotherapeutic drug use, and they raise interesting questions about short-term single-occasion use.", 
    "69": "Anxiety syndromes are poorly defined and classified and none of the systems at present in use is entirely satisfactory: some attempt to define anxiety states purely in terms of symptoms, while others do so by viewing anxiety as the product of interactions between external events and innate tendencies. Whatever scheme is used, however, it is essential that the type and level of anxiety is assessed before undertaking drug treatment. In general, tranquillizers such as benzodiazepines are more effective in lessening acute or chronic sustained levels of anxiety than peaks, as in panic attacks. With sustained levels of anxiety, long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam and clorazepate are usually preferred, while episodic anxiety normally responds best to shorter-acting drugs such as oxazepam or lorazepam. Short-term use of benzodiazepines is justified in patients with severe symptomatic distress and/or impairment of ability to cope. Long-term use is only justified in patients with chronic severe anxiety in which the symptomatic relief and improved functioning outweigh the risk of dependence.", 
    "70": "A combined approach using psychotherapy in conjunction with a repeated single dose regimen of a rapidly absorbed, short half-life benzodiazepine has been employed in patients with intermittent acute anxiety. The strategy is directed at patient identification of precipitating factors and, encouraged by prompt control of symptoms with a single dose, the development of more effective coping mechanisms. If and when to take each dose is decided by the patient who keeps a diary recording anxiety episodes, associated circumstances, medication and response. In addition to providing a medication record, the diary is used as a starting point for the psychotherapy sessions. Results show that giving the patient control of drug intake has been an effective approach in such patients and enhances patient awareness of and capacity to control episodes of acute anxiety.", 
    "71": "Clinical differences exist between the benzodiazepines but demonstration of such differences requires a more specialized methodology than that normally used in comparative trials. It is recommended that double-blind studies should be carried out in hospitalized patients with severe and chronic anxiety, selected according to precise criteria, and that the trials should be designed as crossover rather than as parallel group studies, with randomization of the stages and flexible dosage. A simple graphic method of representing the clinical profile of individual benzodiazepines is described and it is suggested that this could help clinicians adapt their prescribing to each patient's symptoms.", 
    "72": "A double-blind study was carried out in 312 patients seen by their general practitioner for a sleep disorder requiring hypnotic treatment to compare the efficacy and event profile of flunitrazepam and triazolam. Patients were allocated at random to receive a night-time dose of 1 mg flunitrazepam or 0.25 mg triazolam for a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 14 nights. Sleep disturbances, classified as difficulty in falling asleep, troublesome awakenings in the first or the second half of the night, and early morning awakening, were assessed on the initial and final visits and details of any events recorded. The results showed no significant difference between the two treatments with respect to efficacy and event profile and the findings are discussed in the context of the differing pharmacokinetics of the two drugs.", 
    "73": "A study was carried out in general practice to assess the benefit-risk ratio of a single new drug, bromazepam, prior to marketing. Analysis of data supplied by 393 participating doctors on 3101 patients showed that bromazepam, in a dose range of 3 mg to 9 mg daily in divided doses, was effective as an anxiolytic in 79% of the patients and that the acute risk of treatment was predictable and low. It is concluded that the acute benefit-risk ratio is acceptable with respect to the class of drug and indication for which bromazepam is prescribed.", 
    "74": "[3H]Diazepam and [3H] Ro5 -4864 were used as ligands to identify and characterize peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in mouse and rat brown adipose tissue (BAT) membranes. [3H]Diazepam and [3H] Ro5 -4864 binding sites in BAT are pharmacologically similar to peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in other tissues. Stimulators of central-type benzodiazepine receptors had no effect on or inhibited ligand binding to BAT membranes. Brown adipose tissue benzodiazepine binding sites are highly localized to mitochondria-containing subcellular fractions. These binding sites decrease with age in BAT from Fischer 344 rats. Stimulation of BAT thermogenesis in mice with 1-norepinephrine led to a decrease in [3H] Ro5 -4864 binding in the tissue.", 
    "75": "Diazepam (Valium/Roche) inhibited the morphogenesis of explanted stage 8 chick embryos in a dose-related manner. Diazepam, at concn of 400-500 micrograms/ml, preferentially inhibited closure of the neural tube. This inhibition was accompanied by a significant reduction in myosin content of the developing neuroepithelium. Diazepam can be used as a probe to study the contributory role of myosin in cellular and morphogenetic movements.", 
    "76": "It is reasonable to consider treating the patient with an uncomplicated infarction with as many as 10 drugs: a benzodiazepine, a sedative, oxygen, morphine, lidocaine, a nitrate, an anticoagulant, a thrombolytic agent, a beta blocker, and possibly a calcium-channel antagonist. Obviously, experienced judgment must be used in selecting the appropriate agents for each patient. A properly staffed and equipped coronary care unit continues to be the most important preventative for unnecessary deaths during the acute phase of myocardial infarction.", 
    "77": "In this double-blind two-period crossover study, ten healthy volunteers received either 200 mg zimelidine each morning for 5 days, or placebo on the same schedule. On day 5 they received 20 mg temazepam 2 h after zimelidine or placebo. A battery of psychometric tests and subjective measurements was carried out on days 4 and 5. Blood samples were collected on day 5 for pharmacokinetic analysis of temazepam. All the measures of psychomotor performance showed the effects of temazepam, as did two of the subjective measures, the \"alert/drowsy\" and \"steady/dizzy\" visual analogue scales. No effect of zimelidine alone on performance or subjective state was seen. Zimelidine showed no discernible interaction with the effects of temazepam as assessed by subjective reports, by psychomotor tests, or by pharmacokinetic analysis.", 
    "78": "Factors influencing the disposition of clotiazepam in man were evaluated in a series of pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers given a single 5 mg dose. Old age caused an increased volume of distribution of clotiazepam in women, and its clearance tended to be reduced in elderly men. Use of oral contraceptives, cimetidine, isoniazid or a single dose of ethanol had no significant effect on the kinetics of clotiazepam. Although clotiazepam is biotransformed by microsomal oxidation, its clearance appears to be relatively uninfluenced by factors known to alter the clearance of other oxidized benzodiazepines.", 
    "79": "A review of anxiolytic drugs is presented, including ethyl alcohol, barbiturates, diphenylmethane derivatives, glycerol and propanediol derivatives, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Focus on the benzodiazepines and their metabolism and method of action follows. The newest two groups are then reviewed: triazolobenzodiazepines and azaspirodecanediones. The first member of this latter group, buspirone, is then reviewed in detail including the author's personal studies of the drug. The fact that it appears nonaddicting, nonsynergistic with alcohol, lacks impairment of driving-related skills, and is very effective in treating anxiety, may represent a breakthrough.", 
    "80": "The debilitating psychopathology of anxiety neurosis is particularly amenable to relief by pharmacotherapy. While currently available drugs successfully alleviate the distressing symptoms suffered by anxious patients, they also carry potential liabilities which must be considered in their use. Through the use of predictive animal models, researchers hope to elucidate a set of structure-activity relationships through which anxiolytic, and most particularly anxioselective compounds can be rationally designed. Such models should predict side-effect potential as well as efficacy, so that unwanted ancillary effects of potential anxiolytics can be eliminated by appropriate structural modifications. The state of the art in preclinical testing for anxiolytic potential will be discussed with particular emphasis on the need to design test systems capable of detecting anxiolytic activity in diverse, nontraditional chemical series. The contribution of such methodology to the discovery and development of one anxioselective, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, buspirone, will be discussed.", 
    "81": "The ethyl ester of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid (beta-CCE) has a high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and can antagonize some of the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines in rodents. Administration of beta-CCE (2.5 mg/kg) to chair-adapted, male rhesus monkeys (7-9 kg) elicited a behavioral syndrome characterized by extreme agitation, head and body turning, distress vocalization and other behaviors which might be termed 'anxious'. Concomitant increases in plasma cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure were observed. Pretreatment of animals with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg) antagonized the behavioral, endocrine, and somatic changes produced by beta-CCE, but did not elicit any significant changes in these parameters when administered alone. Thus, administration of beta-CCE to primates may be a reliable and reproducible model of human anxiety and, as much, may prove valuable for studying the postulated role of 'stress' or 'anxiety' in a variety of human disorders. In toto, these results strongly suggest that benzodiazepine receptors not only mediate the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines, but may also subserve both the affective and physiologic expression of anxiety."
