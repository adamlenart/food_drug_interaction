Althesin and diazepam were studied in white mice. The doses of the anasthetic agents were selected from the dose-response experiments. When given acutely, LiCl 5 m-equiv/kg prolonged significantly the sleeping time caused by both of the barbiturates, whereas RbCl given for 21 days in tap water shortened the sleeping time induced by methohexitone and ketamine. Both LiCl and RbCl, given acutely, enhanced the sleeping time caused by diazepam. The rectal temperatures were lower in the LiCl-treated mice than in the control and RbCl-treated mice.", 
    "1": "At the Ferguson Clinic, 161 anorectal procedures utilizing intravenously administered diazepam and lidocaine 0.5%, with epinephrine, 1:200,000, were done. Of the patients so treated 12% needed additional medication in order for anesthesia to be effective. No complication resulted from the use of these combinations. It is recommended that the combination of intravenously administered diazepam with local infection of lidocaine and epinephrine be given wider usage because of its ease of handling and very low complication rate.", 
    "2": "Total and free plasma trytophan levels were measured in depressive and manic patients before and after recovery. No change was found in total or free plasma trytophan concentration on recovery from depressive illness. Free plasma tryptophan levels were higher in recovered manics than in active manics, and a group of four manic patients tested before and after recovery showed a significant increase in free plasma tryptophan concentration on recovery.", 
    "3": "Of 402 United States owners of side-viewing duodenoscopes surveyed, 222 (55%) responded, reporting 10,435 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms. Procedure failed occurred in 30%, complications in 3%, and death in 0.2%. Complications included pancreatitis, cholangitis, pancreatic sepsis, instrumental injury to the gastrointestinal tract, and drug reactions. Pancreatitis was associated with injection into the pancreatic duct, sepsis with injection into an obstructed duct or pseudocyst, and injury with abnormal gastroduodenal anatomy. Experienced workers had a 15% incidence of complications, whereas inexperience gave 4 times the failures (62%) and twice the complications (7%). The causes of complications and their prevention are discussed.", 
    "4": "A comparative study of the antiepileptic action of Clonazepam, phenythoin-natrium and phenobarbital has been performed in acute experiments in rabbits. The effort of the three drugs, administered intravenously, was studied on a) the epileptic activity induced by electrical stimulation of the amygdala, b) the interictal and c) ictal epileptic activity of an amygdaloid chemical focus (penicillin in gel). Clonazepam has a definite higher capacity, than the other drugs examined to prevent or to reduce the phenomenon of generalization of epilepsy. However, its effect has a shorter duration.", 
    "5": "Over a period of 8 weeks we compared the tranquilizing effects of the longterm neuroleptic Fluspirilene to those of Diazepam in a series of 28 patients. Both drugs showed good effects on somatization, anxiety and depressive mood. Fluspirilene, however, proved to be the more mood elevating and more activating agent without being hypnotic. The indications for both drugs are being discussed emphazising the new therapeutic perspectives of a long acting tranquilizer.", 
    "6": "Lever pressing of four rats was maintained under a multiple fixed ratio 80, fixed interval 2-min schedule of food presentation. Water was concurrently available from a drinking tube. Overall rates of lever pressing were highest under the fixed ratio schedule and, for three rats, most drinking occurred during the pause preceding responding under the fixed interval schedule. Chlordiazepoxide increased the lower rates of lever pressing maintained under the fixed interval schedule but generally decreased the higher response rates under the fixed ratio schedule. The effects of chlordiazepoxide on schedule-induced licking also depended on the extent to which this response occurred in each schedule component. Typically chlordiazepoxide produced relatively greater increases in the lower levels of licking and either increased less or decreased licking in that component where, under control conditions, this response was more extensive. Chlordiazepoxide also produced overall increases in the total amount of water consumed during the session. When the number of food pellets obtained during the experimental session was given all at one time in the home cage, the amount of water ingested over a period of time equivalent to the session duration was substantially less than that consumed during the experimental session. Chlordiazepoxide did not increase home cage water consumption under this condition.", 
    "7": "Twenty-five patients affected by 30 episodes of tic douloureux were treated with a new anticonvulsant, clonazepam. In 40% there was complete control of the neuralgia and an additional 23.3% were significantly helped by the drug. Sixteen patients had previously been resistant to carbamazepine, and eight of them were completely and one partially relieved by clonazepam. The side-effects, somnolence and unsteadiness of gait, were present to some extent in 80 and 88% of the cases respectively, being severe in about half of them. It is concluded that clonazepam can be considered as a second choice for the treatment of this condition, after proven failure with carbamazepine. Possible mechanisms of action are discussed.", 
    "8": "The effects of atropine, doxapram and isoproterenol upon soman-induced respiratory depression were investigated in the monkey. Administration of atropine resulted in an immediate increase in heart rate accompanied by a gradual increase in respiratory rate. The improvement in the EEG pattern coincided with improvement in respiratory function. Administration of either doxapram or isoproterenal during soman-induced apnea failed to significantly alter any of the physiological parameters. Clonazepam was used to control soman-induced seizure activity and convulsions.", 
    "9": "Fifty-five clinical trials were conducted to determine the cardiovascular combined effects of stressful oral surgery and systemic cannabinols. In a first study, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was given IV as a premedicant and compared with diazepam and with a placebo. A classic dose-related tachycardia followed THC injection. The peak heart rate response of patients premedicated with 0.044 mg/kg THC was 24.1% higher (p less than 0.05) than the peak effect for a nonsurgerized control group, suggesting a synergistic effect between THC and surgical stress. A predisposition to syncopal hypotension followed THC premedication, and antiarrhythmic effects were observed after large doses. The injection of local anesthetic preparations containing epinephrine did not alter THC cardiovascular response. An apparent drug interaction was observed, however, in a second study, in patients given general anesthesia within 72 hours after smoking marijuana. These patients demonstrated sustained abnormal postoperative tachycardia when compared with control nonsmokers, an effect which may have resulted from an interaction between stored cannabinol metabolites and atropine administered as part of the anesthetic technic. It was concluded that THC had no particular advantage over diazepam or placebo as a premedicant. Further, THC altered the patients' adaptivity to stress and interacted undesirably with other anesthetic medications.", 
    "10": "The authors analysed 13 cases of West's syndrome (8 females and 5 males observed in a period of 30 months. In only one case there was history of perinatal trauma. In 7 children the psychomotor development was very good until the time of development of seizures, in 2 children hyperexcitability was present, 1 was obese, 2 had various infections. In 7 cases the seizures developed within 1 to 20 days after DiPerTe or poliomyelitis vaccination. The time from the onset of seizures to beginning of hormonal treatment ranged from 4 weeks to 5 months. Corticosteroids or ACTH were administered for 2 months at least, and benzodiazepine drugs and/or phenobarbital were given additionally. It was found that the effects of treatment were much better in children referred for treatment early after onset of seizures. In cases with delayed hormonal treatment mental retardation was considerable and seizures were frequent.", 
    "11": "The precise determination of the natural isotopic abundance ratios of carbon and hydrogen in several production batches of the commercial product 7-chlor-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-on (diazepam) gave results which allowed certain batches to be differentiated. The differences in the ratios appear to be mainly due to differences in the isotopic composition of the (fossile) starting materials of the synthesis. The measurement of the natural isotopic ratios may therefore offer another possibility to determine the origin of a drug.", 
    "12": "In pargyline or carbidopa pretreated mice, 6-hydroxydopa causes a depletion of brain norepinephrine. Several antidepressant compounds block the depletion after pargyline but not after carbidopa pretreatment. Similarly, p-chloromethamphetamine-induced depletion of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine is blocked by several antidepressants. Diazepam antagonizes the ability to imipramine to block the norepinephrine depletion induced by 6-hydroxydopa but not the 5-hydroxytryptamine depletion induced by p-chloromethamphetamine. Blockade of selective neurotoxic induced depletions of biogenic amines is a useful in vivo technique for determining the effects of drugs on the amine uptake systems. However, the results for compounds with mixed antidepressant/anxiolytic activity must be viewed with caution.", 
    "13": "Salpingectomy by laparoscopy in 200 healthy outpatients employed local analgesia and \"pentazepam\" (pentazocine 90 mg and diazepam 30 mg in 250 ml of 5% D/W) as anesthesia. Patients received no premedication, ventilated spontaneously, without tracheal intubation, but were given nasal O2 at 3 L/min throughout the procedure. N2O was used for abdominal insufflation, and the abdominal pressure and Trendelenburg position were restricted to less than 20 cm H2O pressure and 30 degrees, respectively. Changes in arterial blood gases measured in 12 patients were unremarkable. Prolonged recovery, unsatisfactory surgical conditions, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting were infrequent.", 
    "14": "Three groups of 50 patients were anaesthetized with diazepam 0.32 mg/kg or thiopentone 3.7 mg/kg or propanidid 4.6 mg/kg for elective carfioversion. Propanidid caused more hypotension than diazepam or thiopentone. Apnoea was most frequent following thipentone and excitatory side-effects were most prominent following propanidid; the electric countershock worsened the excitatory phenomena. The success rate of conversion was higher in the diazepam group than in the other groups, but the difference was not statistically significant. Diazepam failed to produce amnesia in about 33% of the patients. Thiopentone is suitable and pleasant for cardioversion. Diazepam is recommended in poor-risk patients and in emergency situations.", 
    "15": "Eight patients with drug intoxication were hemoperfused on ten occasions at a blood-flow rate of 300 ml/min with a 650gm column of Amberlite XAD-4 resin, which is a macroreticular resin with a specific adsorptive attraction for lipid-soluble organic molecules. Column clearances of glutethimide and a variety of barbiturates ranged from 207 to 300 ml/min for treatment sessions extending from 2 1/2 to ten hours. After ingestion of 75 gm of glutethimide, one patient received hemoperfusion on three successive days for nine, ten, and eight hours, respectively. She recovered after the column removed over 30 gm of drug. The patients demonstrated dramatic clinical responses with no evidence of meaningful toxic reactions. Column hemoperfusion with Amberlite XAD-4 resin was simpler and more effective than any known method of removing barbiturates and glutethimide from the blood of patients with drug overdoses.", 
    "16": "A gastroduodenal combination preparation was introduced at a deliberately high dosage into a clinical treatment schema. A marked improvement of the subjective symptoms already appeared after a short treatment in hospital, pain in particular being rapidly affected. Younger patients tolerated the preparation excellently, older ones had a marked sedation. Because of the danger of concealment, stenoses in the region of the gastrointestinal tract, ileus and preileus are particular contraindications. The dosage of 3 X 3 to 3 X 4 dragees should be reserved for hospital treatment. The dosage of 3 X 1 dragee for ambulant practice and also for prolonged therapy (ca. 6-8 weeks) is unobjectionable, reference being made to possible initial tiredness and disturbances of accomodation.", 
    "17": "In a limited study, clonazepam, a new benzodiazepine derivative, has been found to be effective in suppressing choreiform movements in three patients with Huntington's chorea, three patients with non-familial chorea, and in one patient with senile chorea. In two patients with chorea of doubtful aetiology the response was not very satisfactory. A simple method was used to assess objectively the effect on choreiform movements. The effective dose varied from 3-5 to 5-5 mg a day. The drug was well tolerated by most of the patients.", 
    "18": "Single and chronic administration of a low dose of nitrazepam (1 mg/kg) had no effect on sleep cycles in rats. A single injection of a high dose (10 mg/kg) of nitrazepam resulted in prolongation of the total duration of synchronized sleep with a corresponding shortening of desynchronized (paradoxical) sleep. The number of sleep cycles was reduced. Chronic injections of nitrazepam (for 7-14 days) in a dose of 10 mg/kg evoked a gradual prolongation of the duration of paradoxical sleep and an increase in number of sleep cycles. After discontinuance of a long-term administration of nitrazepam (1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) prolongation of desynchronized sleep and an increase in the number of sleep cycles were more pronounced in comparison with the last day of chronic administration of the drug.", 
    "19": "1. Blood levels of nimetazepam after oral administration to dogs were relatively low at early periods after dosage and reached peak levels (7-7-7-9 mug equiv./ml) after 8 h. The time course of blood levels was similar after oral administration of its desmethyl derivative (nitrazepam) to dogs. Blood levels of the latter, however, were low compared with nimetazepam and reached a peak (5-2-6-3 mug equiv./ml) after 4 h. 2. Recoveries of nimetazepam in urine and faeces were 46 and 52% of the dose for 0-24 h, 27 and 34% for 24-48 h and 4 and 6% for 48-72 h, while those of its desmethyl derivative (nitrazepam) were 63 and 71% for 0-24 h, 12 and 21% for 24-48 h and 2 and 3% for 48-72 h. 3. At least four kinds of reaction were involved in the biotransformation of nimetazepam and its desmethyl derivative (nitrazepam): (i) demethylation at N-1 (ii) hydroxylation at C-3, (iii) subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation of 3-hydroxy derivatives and (iv) reduction of the nitro group at C-7 to an amino group. Reaction (i) proceeded very rapidly in dogs, so that the blood metabolites of nimetazepam were closely similar to those of nitrazepam. For both drugs, the major blood metabolite was nitrazepam. Reaction (ii) was rapidly followed by reaction (iii), and glucuronides were predominantly excreted in urine. Reaction (iv) as well as reaction (iii) are important in the excretion of both drugs. The subsequent acetylation of 7-amino group, however, did not occur in dogs as it did in mice and rats.", 
    "20": "By reaction in hot xylene of ethyl benzoylacetate with N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine (I a) and N-benzyl-o-phenylenediamine (I b) three five-membered ring compounds and one seven-membered ring compound were obtained. Compounds isolated were: 1-alkyl-2-phenacylbenzimidazoles (III), 1-alkyl-2-phenylbenzimidazoles (V), 1-alkyl-2-methylbenzimidazoles (VI) and 1-alkyl-4-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzodiazepine-2-ones (IV). In the reaction with N-benzyl-o-phenylenediamine we isolated also the N-benzyl-2-benzoylacetamidoaniline (II b), which by further heating in xylene gave (IV b). The structures of compounds were elucidated from their chemical reactivity and their N.M.R. and I.R. spectra.", 
    "21": "The effects of common tablet excipients on the permeation of diazepam through polydimethylsiloxane membranes and on the turnover time of goldfish were studied. The permeability coefficient decreased and the turnover time increased in the presence of talc, polysorbate 80, and, possibly, fumed silicon dioxide, but these parameters were unaffected by lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, and starch.", 
    "22": "Sixty-five patients primarily referred for erectile impotence were investigated and treated in a psychiatric out-patient department. Information was obtained from patients and wherever possible from their partners. Subjects were treated either with chemotherapy or with a modified form of Masters and Johnson's technique. A controlled group were not given any specific treatment. Results indicated that neither chemotherapy or behaviour modification (modified Masters and Johnson's technique) were in any way superior to no treatment. The prognosis was related to the clinical features of the subjects rather than to the form of treatment. Subjects in whom impotence was caused by a specific psychological or physical trauma showed a much better prognosis than those who had an insidious decline in sexual potency without any discernible psychological or physical factors. The decline in these latter subjects with a very poor prognosis was possibly due to inherent physiological factors.", 
    "23": "The possible involvement of cholinergic mechanisms and of GABA in the modulation and generation of ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves was studied using PGO waves induced by the benzoquinolizine derivative, Ro 4-1284 ( =PGO(1284)), and by p-chlorophenylalanine (=PGO(PCPA)), and continuously recorded and counted in the lateral geniculate bodies of unanaesthetized immobilized cats. Atropine had no significant effect on PGO(1284) but markedly depressed the density of PGO(PCPA) this effect of atropine was absent when the synthesis of noradrenaline (NA) was inhibited in addition to that of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Arecoline and eserine at a low dose increased the density of PGO(PCPA). Both the stimulation of nicotinic receptors by nicotine and their blockade by mecamylamine reduced the amplitude of PGO(1284) and PGO(PCPA). Eserine, 0.3 mg kg(-1) i.v., had a similar effect. GABA injected into a lateral brain ventricle augmented the density of PGO(PCPA) but not the PGO(1284). Increasing the level of endogenous GABA by amino oxyacetic acid (AOAA) and by hydroxylamine affected PGO waves like GABA. Bicuculline tended to decrease the density of PGO(PCPA). Chlordiazepoxide increased the density of PGO(1284) and, more markedly, that of PGO(PCPA). The latter effect was prevented by atropine and by lesions placed in the amygdala, the septum and medial forebrain bundle several days prior to the acute experiment. It is concluded that synapse with nicotinic cholinergic receptors are prsent either in the neuronal network of the pontine reticular cells which trigger the PGO waves or within the pathway leading from this trigger area to the lateral geniculate body or within this structure. It is tentatively suggested that the noradrenergic neurones which depress the formaton of PGO waves, are under a modulating influence from limbic forebrain structures. The suggested pathway originating in the forebrain and projecting to the locus coeruleus seems to be inhibitory for the NA-neurones involved in the modulation of PGO waves and to contain muscarinic cholinergic and GABA-ergic synapse. Chlordiazepoxide might augment the density of PGO(PCPA) either by activating this pathway in the limbic forebrain or by enhancing GABA-ergic transmission at its ending.", 
    "24": "Experiments were conducted on rats. It was shown that sodium oxybutyrate depressed the escape response to punishment of the partner and motivated aggression in much lower doses than the defence conditioned reflex and unmotivated aggression, prevented negative consequences of fear and rage reactions; it also normalized conditioned reflexes in neurotic rats, this pointing to its marked tranquillizing action.", 
    "25": "Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations were determined in healthy volunteers for the first 48 hours after intramuscular injection of 50 mg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride or of its solvent alone. Intramuscular injection of both the drug solution and its solvent was painful and caused CPK elevations. The CPK rise due to the drug solution was 33 per cent higher than that due to the solvent alone, but the difference was not significant. The pH of the solvent preparation is low and it contains high concentrations of propylene glycol. The pain and muscle damage due to injection of the solvent could be due to its acidity and its high osmolarity. Problems associated with intramuscular injections of water-insoluble drugs are not resolved by the use of such solvent preparations.", 
    "26": "An inverse factor analysis of 880 depressed inpatients on 33 endogenous-neurotic variables yielded four patient types. Type 3 resembled the endogenous depressions and Type 2 the neurotic depressions. Type 3 patients responded well to both imipramine and chlorpromazine and did poorly on a placebo. Type 2 patients showed the greatest overall improvement at three weeks irrespective of treatment received, including a placebo.", 
    "27": "Nitrazepam is metabolized in part by nitro-reduction to an amine followed by acetylation. This acetylation step has been shown to be under the control of the same genetic polymorphism as sulphamethazine (syn: sulphadimidine).", 
    "28": "Ten healthy male subjects ingested 25 mg of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (Librium) with 100 ml of water or with 100 ml of magnesium and aluminum hydroxide (Maalox) in a single-dose crossover study. Multiple venous blood samples drawn during the first 24 hr after each dose were assayed for concentrations of chlordiazepoxide and its major metabolite, desmethylchlordiazepoxide. The antacid prolonged the mean chlordiazepoxide absorption half-time from 11 to 24 min, and in 6 of 10 subjects delayed achievement of the peak blood concentration by from 0.5 to 3.0 hrs. The formation of desmethylclordiazepoxide was also slowed. The areas under the 24 hr blood concentration curve for chlordiazepoxide and for its metabolite were not influenced by the antacid. The apparent elimination half-life of chlordiazepoxide (8.4 and 8.2 hr) was not significantly affected. Administration of chlordiazepoxide with antacid reduces the rate of its absorption but does not alter the completeness of absorption or the apparent rate of elimination.", 
    "29": "1 Six volunteers of mean age 59 years received placebo for week, then fosazepam (60 mg) nightly for 3 weeks, then placebo for 3 weeks. Subjective ratings and all-night electrophysiological recordings were made. 2 Fosazepam administration improved subjective sleep quality nut impaired feelings of morning vitality. Its withdrawal was associated with anxiety, impaired concentration and continuing impairment of morning vitality. Measured sleep duration increased on fosazepam, sleep was less broken, slow wave sleep stages 3 and 4 diminished in duration and so did REM sleep. 3 Despite the short-life of fosazepam some drug effects persisted for several days after withdrawal, suggesting action of a long half-life metabolite.", 
    "30": "Fifty-seven chronic agoraphobic outpatients were treated by 12 hours of exposure in vivo on four days over two weeks to check the effects of oral diazepam versus placebo during group exposure, group versus individual exposure, and high versus medium anxiety arousal during individual exposure. The controlled parallel design allowed comparative evaluation of each treatment condition to six months follow-up. Assessment was blind with respect to drug and psychological treatment. Patients in all treatment conditions improved significantly in phobias and in related life areas. Outcome to group exposure on phobias and other measures was similar in all three drug conditions (placebo, waning diazepam, peak diazepam) with no significant differences between them. Diazepam patients had significantly less discomfort than placebo patients during group exposure treatment. Group exposure patients improved slightly but significantly more than individual exposure patients on non-phobic measures, though group exposure was accompanied by more panics during treatment yet was easier to run by the therapist. Individual exposure under high anxiety arousal was no more therapeutic than with lower anxiety. Diazepam is a mild palliative during group exposure but does not facilitate outcome to treatment. Group exposure in vivo is mildly facilitatory for outcome compared with individual exposure. Anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful.", 
    "31": "In a double-blind crossover study involving 15 insomniac subjects, the hypnotic efficacy of lorazepam, 2 and 4 mg, was compared with flurazepam, 15 and 30 mg, and placebo. Five subjective measures were used: onset, length, and depth of sleep, number of times awakened, and satisfaction with the hypnotic. Lorazepam in 2- and 4-mg doses was comparable in hypnotic efficacy to flurazepam, 30 mg, according to most parameters of measurement. Side effects were minor, although relatively numerous at the 4-mg doses.", 
    "32": "The interaction between Parafilm and four tranquilizers in their neutral phosphate buffer solutions resulted in various degrees of loss of the drugs from the solutions. The values of loss ranged from 15 to 34% for chlorpromazine and 8 to 42% for butaperazine at the initial concentration range of 2 to 20 mug/ml at room temperature (22 +/- 1 degree C). Under the same conditions, the values of loss from saliva for these two drugs were fairly constant; about 25% and 17%, respectively. For diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, the losses from the buffer solution were below 5%.", 
    "33": "A study was carried out of 30 consecutive patients with withdrawal psychosis who in the period 1972 to 1975 were admitted to a psychiatric department or were attended by the department while hospitalized in a somatic department. There was a clear majority of women among cases of psychosis following drug withdrawal (15 as against four) and a clear majority of men among cases of psychosis following alcohol withdrawal (nine as against two). Competing pathogenetic factors could be considered present in most cases in the last mentioned group. In most cases the abrupt cessation took place in conjunction with admission to hospital, most frequently surgical cases or cases of acute drug toxication. In other cases abrupt cessation was decided upon by the patient himself. Frequently predelirium treatment was either omitted or was given in the form of neuroleptics. Approximately a quarter of the patients initially denied their abuse. The study indicates that withdrawal psychosis can make its debut or become manifest at so late a stage as about the 14th day of the withdrawal phase following use of benzodiazepines and d-propoxiphene. It is further indicated that abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines taken in \"therapeutic\" doses for several years in some instances can give rise to a withdrawal psychosis.", 
    "34": "In conscious trained dogs, administration of bromazepam (0.3 mg/kg p.o.) or diazepam (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg p.o.) had no influence on heart rate. A higher dose (10 mg/kg p.o.) of two benzodiazepines elicited a positive chronotropic effect which was rapid in onset and of long duration. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent practolol (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) did not revert heart rate after the benzodiazepines to the same level as in controls, indicating that the tachycardia was not produced by an increase in sympathetic outflow to the heart. For diazepam, a sympathetic--parasympathetic interaction cannot be excluded. However, diazepam and bromazepam significantly reduced the tachycardia which is normally observed after administration of methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) alone or in combination with practolol. In anaesthetized dogs, bromazepam failed to modify the heart rate responses to electrical stimulation of cardiac vagal or sympathetic nerves, excluding an action on this compound on ganglionic transmission and cardiac cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors. It is concluded that high doses of diazepam and bromazepam influence the heart rate of conscious dogs in a biphasic way. Firstly, they cause a central reduction of vagal tone to the heart resulting in tachycardia. Secondly, the two drugs decrease the cardiac pacemaker rate directly. Since the overall effect is tachycardia, the central action is more pronounced.", 
    "35": "Fifty-eight neurotic patients with intense anxiety were treated with either lorazepam or diazepam in a double blind between-patients trial. Statistical analysis indicated that the two groups were homogeneous before treatment and that the results of treatment were similar for both drugs. According to the global rating of illness week after week, after four weeks of treatment more patients on lorazepam than on diazepam were normal or had mild illness (82.1% vs. 70.8%). In the investigators' judgment, 71.9% of the patients treated with lorazepam had an excellent or good response compared with 56.7+ of those treated with diazepam. The mean reduction in score on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale was 17.7 for lorazepam and 16.5 for diazepam. However, none of the above differences in results were statistically significant. The largest dose of lorazepam required in treatment was 6 mg, compared with 30 mg of diazepam. Two patients treated with lorazepam had side effects, against six with diazepam. Six patients in the diazepam group did not complete the trial, including three who discontinued because of side effects (rash, tremors, agitation); no patients in the lorazepam group dropped out.", 
    "36": "A simple gas chromatographic method for the determination of clonazepam in human plasma has been developed. After solvent extraction, the compound is measured by an electron capture detector on an OV-17 column. The electron-capture response is linear for 5-120 ng/ml of plasma. There is no interference from other commonly used anti-epileptic drugs or endogenous substrates. Preliminary data from routin monitoring of epileptic patients shows a 10-fold variation in their clonazepam plasma levels.", 
    "37": "Apart from sufficient experience on the part of the examining physician and adequate technical apparatus, proper premedication can facilitate the procedures for both patient and physician considerably. The paper reports on experience gained in 500 laparoscopies carried out under conditions which were deviated slightly from those hitherto recommended in the literature. The analgesic employed was Tilidine (in Germany: Valoron), and Diazepam was used as a sedative; both of these substances were given intravenously, the vein was kept open for the entire course of the examination. The Tilidine dose was normally 50-100 mg, but under exceptional circumstances as much as 150 mg. Tilidine showed good analgesic effectiveness and tolerance; no case or nausea or vomiting and no sign of respiratory depression of effects on smooth muscle were observed under the conditions stated. The fact that Tilidine is not subject to the restrictions imposed by the German narcotics law is also seen as an advantage. The Diazepam dose was 5-30 mg. Apart from its sedative effect Diazepam also diminishes the tonus of skeletal muscle (important in laparoscopy) and has a relatively long time of elimination (20-48 h). In addition to these two substances, 10-20 ccm of 1% Lidocaine solution with Epinephrine additive was given as a local anaesthetic. The investigators' experience with the above premedication procedure was found to be convincingly positive.", 
    "38": "Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was compared with diphenylhydantoin (DPH), phenobarbital (PB) and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) using several standard laboratory procedures to determine anticonvulsant activity in mice, i.e., the maximal electroshock test (MES), and seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol, strychnine and nicotine. In the MES test, THC was the least potent and DPH the most potent blocker of hind limb tonic extensor convulsions whereas THC was the most potent and DPH the least potent in increasing the latency to this response and in preventing mortality. Seizures and mortality induced by pentylenetetrazol or by strychnine were enhanced by THC and DPH and were blocked by PB and CDP. In the test with nicotine, none of the four anticonvulsant agents prevented seizures; DPH was the only one which failed to increase latency; THC and DPH were less potent than PB and CDP in preventing mortality. THC most closely resembled DPH in the tests with chemical convulsant agents, but a sedative action of THC, resembling that of PB and CDP, was indicated by low ED5 0 for increased latency and for prevention of mortality in the MES test.", 
    "39": "Despite the widespread use of isoniazid, suicidal ingestion is rare. Two patients are presented who ingested 5 gm and 12 gm respectively, both having seizures within two hours and severe metabolic adisosis. They were treated successfully with intravenous administration of diazepam and bicarbonate, and forced diuresis. Both patients showed a mild rise in levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic acid dehydrogenase. Physicians should be alerted to the possibility of isoniazid ingestion in patients with an unexplained severe metabolic acidosis and seizures.", 
    "40": "Oxygen consumption (VO2) was determined in 10 patients with moderate tetanus. The mean (+/- SE) VO2 of 425-2-2 +/- 50-3 ml/min on admission fell significantly to 249-9 +/- 13-1 ml/min standard temperature and pressure dry (STPD) after parenteral diazepam. There was also a significant fall in minute ventilation after administration of diazepam. The results suggest that the simple practical determination of VO2 will be of immense value in assessing the efficacy of muscle relaxants, assessing the severity of tetanus, and determining the calorie needs of patients.", 
    "41": "On the basis of the experiments on animals the author made an attempt to find out the place of the action of some psychotropic drugs on the central nervous system and to discover the changes, which occurred in the functional state of various cerebral structures. He used drugs Imupramine (Psychoforin) and Diazepan (Valium), administered localy in some structures of the lymbic system and reticular formation of the cat cerebrum, using stereotaxic technique. The evaluation of the occurred changes was made by the changes in the spontaneous and induced cerebral activity, using the method of double stimuli. The obtained results gave foundation to state that drugs with antidepresive action (Imipramin) inhibited amigdalic complex and the structures connected with it, but benzodiazepines (Diazepam) revealed this action also on the mesencephalic reticular formation as the structures, brocked by the antidepresants, were not affected. In conclusion an electrophysilogic argumentation was made for the combined application of both groups of preparations in neurotic patients.", 
    "42": "The authors studied the effect of seduxen and elenium on 169 patients, particularly their pulse frequency, arterial pressure, electro- and polycardiogramms in a single administration of the drugs parenterally and in a long-term per os administration. A parenteral introduction of both drugs was accompanied by a slight bradycardial effect. However, high doses of seduxen (0.34--0.5 mg/kg) lead to states of tachycardia. Unlike elenium which did not exert a hypotensive effect, seduxen displayed a mild and in some cases significant hypotensive action.", 
    "43": "A study was undertaken to determine the activation profile and psychometric performances in 10 adult volunteer subjects. The activation profile was evaluated by measuring heart and respiratory rates and also the H reflex (motor response). Psychometric performances during two attention tests were measured by the subjects' scores. The subjects were then submitted to a per os psychotrope drug treatment at a liminar therapeutic dose. Psychometric performances were decreased in subjects given a strong psychoactivator drug (amphetamine, genozolone), while they could be increased to an optimal level with a less active psycho-activation (Pyrisuccid\u00e9anol). Under the same conditions, the motor response, tested using the H-reflex, varied in the same way as the psychometric performance curve. However, the cardiac and respiratory rates show changes induced by the administered drugs. These results show some conditions were performance and activation are dissociated under the effect of psycho-active drugs.", 
    "44": "Pigeons were rewarded with grain for pecking a key under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. After responding stabilized, each key-peck produced a 3.5 mA electric shock, about 50 msec in duration. Dose-effect curves for pentobarbital, d-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide on punished responding were determined in these pigeons when their body weights were adjusted to 70%, 90% or 100% of their free-feeding weights. The lower the body weight, the higher the rate of punished responding before drugs were given. Pentobarbital increased punished responding in all three body weights, but it produced the largest increases in punished responding over the widest dose range when the body weight was maintained at 90% of the free-feeding weight. Chlordiazepoxide also tended to produce rate increases at all three body weights, but d-amphetamine increased the rate only when the birds were maintained at 100% of their free-feeding weights."
