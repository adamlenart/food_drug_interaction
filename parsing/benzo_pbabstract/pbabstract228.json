    "2": "Forty-five children ages 1-6 years were randomly assigned to receive either 0.5 mg kg(-1) oral midazolam, 0.2 mg kg(-1) subcutaneous midazolam by J-Tip injector or 0.2 mg kg(-1) intramuscular midazolam by Bioject injector. After midazolam administration the children were monitored for oxygen saturation, heart rate and level of sedation (0, alert; 1, calm; 2, drowsy; 3, dozing; 4, asleep) every 2 min for 20 min by a physician blinded to the route of administration. Patient satisfaction, resistance to treatment, success of delivery, problems with separation, and acceptance of mask at the time of induction were evaluated after midazolam treatment.", 
    "3": "The Bioject showed a faster onset of sedation than either the J-Tip injector or the oral midazolam (P < 0.05). The children were significantly less satisfied with the Bioject and J-Tip administration vs oral midazolam (P < 0.05). There were no differences in resistance, success of delivery, problems with separation, mask acceptance, arterial oxygen saturation or heart rate.",

    "5": "A liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric assay with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LC/APCI-MS) is presented for fast and reliable screening and identification and also for precise and sensitive quantification in plasma of the 23 benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, camazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, desalkylflurazepam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, metaclazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, temazepam and tetrazepam, triazolam, their antagonist flumazenil and the benzodiazepine BZ1 (omega 1) receptor agonists zaleplone, zolpidem and zopiclone. It allows confirmation of the diagnosis of an overdose situation and monitoring of psychiatric patients' compliance. The analytes were isolated from plasma using liquid-liquid extraction and were separated on a Merck LiChroCART column with Superspher 60 RP Select B as the stationary phase. Gradient elution was performed using aqueous ammonium formate and acetonitrile. After screening and identification in the scan mode using the authors' LC/MS library, the analytes were quantified in the selected-ion monitoring mode. The quantification assay was fully validated. It was found to be selective proved to be linear from sub-therapeutic to over therapeutic concentrations for all analytes, except bromazepam. The corresponding reference levels the assay's accuracy and precision data for all studied substances are listed. The accuracy and precision data were within the required limits with the exception of those for bromazepam. The analytes were stable in frozen plasma for at least 1 month. The validated assay was successfully applied to several authentic plasma samples from patients treated or intoxicated with various benzodiazepines or with zaleplone, zolpidem or zopiclone. It has proven to be appropriate for the isolation, separation, screening, identification and quantification of the drugs mentioned above in plasma for clinical toxicology, e.g. in cases of poisoning, and forensic toxicology, e.g. in cases of driving under the influence of drugs.",

However, this study is not large enough to have adequate power to determine whether or not the rate of major malformations is increased in clonazepam-exposed pregnancies. No increase has been identified in three other case series. Although the number of patients in this series was larger than previous reports, continued monitoring of pregnancies is needed to determine whether or not clonazepam is teratogenic.", 
    "10": "Sedative doses of anesthetic agents affect upper-airway function. Oral-maxillofacial surgery is frequently performed on sedated patients whose mouths must be as open as possible if the procedures are to be accomplished successfully. We examined upper-airway pressure-flow relationships in closed mouths, mouths opened moderately, and mouths opened maximally to test the hypothesis that mouth-opening compromises upper-airway patency during midazolam sedation. From these relationships, upper-airway critical pressure (Pcrit) and upstream resistance (Rua) were derived. Maximal mouth-opening increased Pcrit to -3.6 +/- 2.9 cm H2O compared with -8.7 +/- 2.8 (p = 0.002) for closed mouths and -7.2 +/- 4.1 (p = 0.038) for mouths opened moderately. In contrast, Rua was similar in all three conditions (18.4 +/- 6.6 vs. 17.7 +/- 7.6 vs. 21.5 +/- 11.6 cm H2O/L/sec). Moreover, maximum mouth-opening produced an inspiratory airflow limitation at atmosphere that was eliminated when nasal pressure was adjusted to 4.3 +/- 2.7 cm H2O. We conclude that maximal mouth-opening increases upper-airway collapsibility, which contributes to upper-airway obstruction at atmosphere during midazolam sedation.", 
    "11": "To compare long-term effectiveness and safety of risperidone versus olanzapine as adjunctive maintenance treatments of bipolar disorder. Retrospective observational chart review of 29 outpatients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder (type I = 15, type II = 3, NOS = 5, schizoaffective = 6) who received risperidone or olanzapine added to lithium or valproate >3 months. Acute indications were depression (n = 8), manic/hypomanic/mixed states (n = 8), rapid cycling (n = 6), other indications (n = 6), and prophylaxis (n = 1). Logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors (i.e., severity of illness, comorbid substance abuse, diagnostic subtype). Overall duration of follow-up was 65.9+/-70.1 weeks. Mild to moderate response was similar in the risperidone and olanzapine groups after adjusting for potential confounders (OR = 0.91, 95% CI [0.05, 16.17]). Somewhat greater adjusted moderate to marked response (OR >3.60, 95% CI [0.31, >42.00]) and longer duration of treatment (HR = 0.52, 95% CI [0.22, 1.22]) occurred in the risperidone group, but were still compatible with the null hypothesis. Weight gain occurred more frequently with olanzapine (57%) than risperidone (13%). EPS was similar, and tardive dyskinesia did not occur. Risperidone and olanzapine appeared to have similar real-world maintenance effectiveness for bipolar disorder, but differed somewhat in side effects.", 
    "12": "Stuttering is a speech disorder that affects one-percent of all adults and much has been learned recently of its neurologic correlates. Stuttering has been associated with excessive cerebral activity of the neurotransmitter, dopamine. Pharmacologic research has suggested that older generation dopamine antagonist (i.e. \"typical antipsychotic\") medications improve stuttering symptoms, but are associated with poorly tolerated adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine, a novel dopamine antagonist (or \"atypical antipsychotic\"), versus placebo in the treatment of adult developmental stuttering. Twenty-four adults who stutter participated in a twelve-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at two separate sites. Subjects received either olanzapine (2.5 mg titrated to 5 mg) or matching placebo. Subjects were rated on an objective measure of stuttering severity (SSI-3), a clinician based global impression (CGI), and a subject-rated self-assessment of stuttering (SSS). Subjects were also monitored for potential side-effects. Twenty-three of the twenty-four subjects enrolled in the trial successfully completed the full course of the study. Olanzapine was statistically superior to placebo on the three ratings of stuttering severity, the SSI-3, the CGI and SSS (p < .05). Olanzapine is a promising medication for the treatment of stuttering and further research is warranted.", 
    "13": "Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) is a popular dietary supplement. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of a valerian extract on the activity of the drug-metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 3A4. Probe drugs dextromethorphan (30 mg; CYP2D6 activity) and alprazolam (2 mg; CYP3A4 activity) were administered orally to healthy volunteers (n = 12) at baseline and again after exposure to two 500-mg valerian tablets (1000 mg) nightly for 14 days. The valerian supplement contained a total valerenic acid content of 5.51 mg/tablet. Dextromethorphan to dextorphan metabolic ratios (DMRs) and alprazolam pharmacokinetics were determined at baseline and after valerian treatment. The DMR was 0.214 +/- 0.025 at baseline and 0.254 +/- 0.026 after valerian supplementation (p > 0.05). For alprazolam, the maximum concentration in plasma was significantly increased after treatment with valerian (25 +/- 7 ng/ml versus 31 +/- 8 ng/ml; p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters at baseline and after valerian exposure (all p values > or = 0.05; time to reach maximum concentration in plasma, 3.0 +/- 3.2 versus 3.1 +/- 2.1 h; area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, 471 +/- 183 versus 539 +/- 240 hx ng x ml(-1); half-life of elimination, 13.5 +/- 4.3 versus 12.2 +/- 5.6 h). Our results indicate that although a modest increase was observed in the alprazolam Cmax, typical doses of valerian are unlikely to produce clinically significant effects on the disposition of medications dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways of metabolism.", 
    "14": "Alkaline pH induced conformational changes in different domains of bovine serum albumin were studied by using domain specific ligands: chloroform, bilirubin and diazepam for domains I, II and III respectively. The effect of alkaline pH on the secondary structure of BSA was monitored by far-UV CD in the range 250 nm to 200 nm. The pH profiles of BSA in the alkaline region showed a two-step change, one corresponding to N<-->B transition (pH 7.5 to 9.0) and the other to B --> U (pH 11.0 to 13.5). Binding of chloroform decreased continuously on increasing pH, whereas binding of diazepam, remained unchanged up to pH 9 and decreased thereafter. In contrast, binding of bilirubin gradually increased up to pH 11.0 and decreased thereafter reaching a value similar to one obtained with native BSA at pH 11.5. Above pH 11.5, bilirubin binding decreased and was abolished completely at pH 12.5. In the pH region 7.5 to 11.0, a continuous decrease in chloroform binding (pH 7.5 to 9.5) and a late decrease in diazepam binding (pH 9.5 to 11.0) suggested major loss of native conformation of domain I followed by domain III during alkaline induced unfolding of BSA. However, a significant increase in bilirubin binding showed a favorable conformational rearrangement in domain II in this pH region (pH7.5 to 11.0). Further, a nearly complete abolishment of bilirubin binding to BSA and significant loss of secondary structure around pH 12.5 indicated that domain II was more resistant to alkaline pH and unfolds only at extreme alkalinity. Taken together, these data suggest that unfolding of three domains of BSA follow the following order of susceptibility towards alkaline denaturation of BSA domain I>domain III>domain II.", 
    "15": "Approximately 4% of children experience febrile seizures, making it one of the most common childhood neurologic disorders. Most incidences occur between six months and three years of age, and 30%-40% of these children will experience a recurrence. The priorities in emergent management of pediatric seizures are airway maintenance, seizure termination and correction of reversible causes. When a child experiences a febrile seizure, gradual passive cooling will assist the child in terminating it. The exact cause of febrile seizures is still uncertain, but studies seem to suggest that the height of the fever is less of a factor than the rapidity of its rise. In other words, a child is more likely to seize if his or her temperature rises rapidly, even if it reaches a lower maximum temperature. The same child may slowly increase his/her temperature to a higher maximum without suffering a seizure. In this case, the patient obviously had a respiratory infection that was the source of the fever. It is important to reassure the parents in such a case of the benign nature of febrile seizures and that less than 5% of children experiencing them will develop a seizure disorder. The seizure in this case was terminated with i.v. Atvan, a drug that has been shown to work well as an anticonvulsant in children. But in most circumstances, a febrile seizure will end spontaneously or with gentle cooling. Either acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be given to treat the fever, and rectal forms of these medicines are preferred in the early treatment phase. Oral forms of the medicine can be administered after the child has stopped seizing and is not vomiting. The child should be exposed to a cooler, but not cold, environment, and the airway supported. Tepid baths can help to bring down a fever, but alcohol rubdowns or any fast cooling measures should be avoided because they may induce shivering and further elevate the fever.", 
    "16": "Prolongation of the cardiac action potential and the effective refractory period is a proven principle to prevent cardiac arrhythmias, especially under conditions when the action potential is shortened. Several approaches have been made to achieve this effect selectively and without proarrhythmic side effects. Besides the blockade of the cardiac sodium channel, blockade of the delayed rectifier potassium channel I(K) was attempted to achieve this goal. After the discovery that the delayed rectifier potassium channel I(K) consists of two distinct channels, the rapidly and the slowly delayed rectifier potassium channel I(Kr) and I(Ks) respectively, blockers for these targets were looked for. But most of the described blockers of I(K), like dofetilide and D-sotalol, are highly selective and potent I(Kr) channel blockers or have only a side-activity on the I(Ks) channel, as described for azimilide. These compounds have shown their efficacy in terminating atrial or ventricular fibrillation under certain circumstances, but they also have shown high risk to induce arrhythmias by themselves. It was speculated that I(Ks) channel blockers may be free of this unwanted effect and several companies put effort to find compounds selective for this novel target. The strategies to find potent and selective I(Ks) channel will be reviewed as well as their first results in in-vitro and in-vivo models of arrhythmia. As side effects are a potential danger for this ubiquitous channel, also the safety studies with these compounds will be summarized.", 
    "17": "Intravenous sedation is routinely administered for endoscopic examinations to help alleviate patient anxiety and discomfort. The goal of moderate sedation is to provide patient comfort to facilitate the completion of the procedure. Nurse administration of intravenous meperidine and midazolam under the direct supervision of the gastroenterologist is the traditional method for achieving this outcome. More recently, physicians have been requesting monitored anesthesia care for the administration of propofol when performing procedures expected to be technically difficult. Propofol is a rapid acting sedative-hypnotic that produces the desired level of consciousness without the residual sedative effect that often persists with the use of benzodiazepines and analgesics. This article reviews current literature regarding the use of propofol for sedation of patients in the endoscopy setting, and highlights the trends in research that may impact future nursing practice.", 
    "18": "The neural basis of trait anxiety is poorly understood. In genetically selected hyperanxious (high anxiety-related behavior; HAB) rats, diazepam induces a stronger anxiolytic response than in hypoanxious (low anxiety-related behavior; LAB) rats. A screen for neuronal response differences to diazepam between HAB and LAB rats using pharmacologic fMRI (phMRI) at 7 T revealed a blunted diazepam-induced neuronal deactivation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) of HABs. This was not due to reduced benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor densities in this region. Instead, dmPFC tissue oxygenation at baseline was found to be significantly lower in HABs. This suggests a tonic relative hypoactivity under the highly stressful phMRI conditions, offering an explanation for the reduced responsivity to the neural depressant effect of diazepam in the sense of a floor effect. Subsequently, Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) showed that ethologically relevant stressors also cause less dmPFC activation in HABs. In the context of an anxiety-inhibiting role of the dmPFC, we propose that failure to sufficiently activate this region in stressful situations may contribute to high trait anxiety.",

Differences between earlier and later studies can largely be explained by different inclusion criteria and improving methodology. The finding of some increase of GABAA receptor binding in IGE has a potential pathologic basis in microdysgenesis. Future studies aiming to elucidate the pathophysiology of IGEs may benefit from the use of subtype-specific opioid ligands, available now, and GABAB ligands, if and when they become available.", 
    "21": "MR imaging allows the in vivo detection of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and has been instrumental in the delineation of the syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with HS (mTLE-HS). MR features of HS include hippocampal atrophy with an increased T2 signal. Quantitative MR imaging accurately reflects the degree of hippocampal damage.Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in mTLE-HS shows typical perfusion patterns of ipsilateral temporal lobe hyperperfusion, and ipsilateral frontoparietal and contralateral cerebellar hypoperfusion. Interictal 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) shows multiregional hypometabolism, involving predominantly the ipsilateral temporal lobe. 11C-flumazenil PET shows hippocampal decreases in central benzodiazepine receptor density. Future strategies to study the etiology and pathogenesis of HS should include longitudinal MR imaging studies,MR studies in families with epilepsy and febrile seizures, stratification for genetic background, coregistration with SPECT and PET, partial volume correction and statistical parametric mapping analysis of SPECT and PET images.",

    "24": "The prevalence of one-month insomnia was 6% overall with a higher rate in elderly women (8%) than men (4.5%). Frequent use of hypnotics over the past month was 8.4%. Among specific sleep complaints, poor sleep quality was the most commonly reported symptom, followed by difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep or early morning awakenings. Increasing age did not correlate with an increased rate of insomnia and female gender was not an independent risk factor. Factors associated with insomnia for both genders were nocturnal micturation (OR = 20.6) and regular use of hypnotics (OR = 3.2). Pulmonary disease (OR = 2.7), not married (OR = 2.3), excessive daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.4), and mental illness (OR = 8.6) were risk factors for men while lack of education (OR = 1.8) and body pain (OR = 2.6) were risk factors for women. Depression (OR = 2.2) was strongly associated with insomnia in the elderly women as well.", 
    "25": "There was a low insomnia prevalence rate in the urban elderly community. Identified insomniacs required treatment of physical and mental problems, particularly in gender-specific risk factors. For those who complained of putative poor sleep quality symptom, early intervention may halt their progress of sleep disturbance and avoid unnecessary benzodiazepine use. Future longitudinal studies to investigate causes of insomnia, as well as its detrimental effects on mood and health, are warranted.",

Olanzapine is largely metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2. Smoking, which induces CYP1A2, is expected to increase clearance of olanzapine by 40%; however, dosage adjustment in smokers is not currently recommended. Additionally, female gender is expected to reduce clearance by 30%. Many institutions target high-dose olanzapine prescribers in an effort to reduce unnecessary drug costs. However, factors such as smoking or gender may necessitate increased doses.", 
    "27": "A retrospective review of all patients receiving olanzapine during an inpatient stay at a state psychiatric hospital in Kentucky during 2001 was conducted. Demographic information and smoking status were collected for all patients. Olanzapine doses of > 20 mg/day were considered high doses.",

The percentages were similar in women and men (10% vs. 9%, p =.69) and in smokers and nonsmokers (9% vs. 9%, p =.82). Moreover, the mean maximum olanzapine dose was also similar in men and women (15.4 +/- 7.2 vs. 14.9 +/- 7.3 mg/day, p =.51). The odds of receiving a high dose of olanzapine were increased 2.1 for patients with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis (DSM-IV schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder). The odds of receiving a high dose of olanzapine were increased with each incremental increase in length of stay (intermediate length of stay [8-60 days], OR = 5.6; long-term length of stay [> 60 days], OR = 12.0, relative to acute length of stay [< 8 days]).", 
    "29": "Neither gender nor smoking status was associated with receiving a high dose of olanzapine. The association of increased length of stay with high dose suggests that treatment resistance may be an important factor in receiving high daily doses of olanzapine.",

    "32": "Seven monkeys (6 male) were randomly assigned to self-administer methohexital-a barbiturate (n=4), midazolam-a benzodiazepine (n=3), or ethanol (n=5). Each monkey had a surgically implanted indwelling venous catheter, and was trained to respond on a fixed ratio of 30 lever presses to receive an injection of drug or saline. Blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the self-administration sessions for the measurement of ACTH and cortisol by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "33": "Although methohexital, midazolam, and ethanol all maintained self-administration behavior across a range of doses, they differed in their effects on ACTH and cortisol. Ethanol inhibited ACTH and cortisol secretion. Methohexital and midazolam both tended to decrease ACTH and cortisol at large doses, and increase these hormones at small doses, but the HPA effects of neither drug differed significantly from when saline was available.", 
    "34": "The neutral overall effect of methohexital and midazolam on HPA activity is consistent with other monkey and human studies, whereas the inhibitory effect of self-administered ethanol in the monkey contrasts with both the rat and human literature. The data in this study suggest that a change in HPA axis activity is not a requirement for drug-reinforced behavior in monkeys.", 
    "35": "The globus pallidus occupies a critical position in the 'indirect' pathway of the basal ganglia and, as such, plays an important role in the modulation of movement. In recent years, the importance of the globus pallidus in the normal and malfunctioned basal ganglia is emerging. However, the function and operation of various transmitter systems in this nucleus are largely unknown. GABA is the major neurotransmitter involved in the globus pallidus. By means of electrophysiological recording, immunohistochemistry and behavioral studies, new information on the distribution and functions of the GABAergic neurotransmission in the rat globus pallidus has been generated. Morphological studies revealed the existence of GABA(A) receptor, including its benzodiazepine binding site, and GABA(B) receptor in globus pallidus. At subcellular level, GABA(A) receptors are located at the postsynaptic sites of symmetric synapses (putative GABAergic synapses). However, GABA(B) receptors are located at both pre- and postsynaptic sites of symmetric, as well as asymmetric synapses (putative excitatory synapses). Consistent with the morphological results, functional studies showed that activation of GABA(B) receptors in globus pallidus reduces the release of GABA and glutamate by activating presynaptic auto- and heteroreceptors, and hyperpolarizes pallidal neurons by activating postsynaptic receptors. In addition to GABA(B) receptor, activation of GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine binding site and blockade of GABA uptake change the activity of globus pallidus by prolonging the duration of GABA current. In agreement with the in vitro effect, activation of GABA(B) receptor, GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine binding site and blockade of GABA uptake cause rotation in behaving animal. Furthermore, the GABA system in the globus pallidus is involved in the etiology of Parkinson's disease and regulation of seizures threshold. It has been demonstrated that the abnormal hypoactivity and synchronized rhythmic discharge of globus pallidus neurons associate with akinesia and resting tremor in parkinsonism. Recent electrophysiological and behavioral studies indicated that the new anti-epileptic drug, tiagabine, is functional in globus pallidus, which may present more information to understand the involvement of globus pallidus in epilepsy.", 
    "36": "Recently, we demonstrated that mice lacking the GABA(B(1)) subunit were more anxious than wild-type animals in several behavioural paradigms, most notably in the light-dark test. In an attempt to assess the effects of classical benzodiazepine anxiolytics on anxiety-like behaviour observed in these mice, animals were administered either chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, p.o.) or diazepam (7.5 mg/kg, p.o.) prior to testing in the light-dark box. Surprisingly, in contrast with the wild-type mice, neither benzodiazepines decreased anxiety-like behaviour in GABA(B(1))(-/-) mice. These data suggest that targeted deletion of GABA(B(1)) subunit alters GABA(A) receptor function in vivo.", 
    "37": "It is anticipated that gamma-secretase inhibitors (gamma-Sec-I) that modulate Notch processing will alter differentiation in tissues whose architecture is governed by Notch signaling. To explore this hypothesis, Han Wistar rats were dosed for up to 5 days with 10-100 micromol/kg b.i.d. gamma-Sec-I from three chemical series that inhibit Notch processing in vitro at various potencies (Notch IC(50)). These included an arylsulfonamide (AS) (142 nM), a dibenzazepine (DBZ) (1.7 nM), and a benzodiazepine (BZ) (2.2 nM). The DBZ and BZ caused dose-dependent intestinal goblet cell metaplasia. In contrast, the AS produced no detectable in vivo toxicity, despite higher exposure to free drug. In a time course using BZ, small intestinal crypt cell and large intestinal glandular cell epithelial apoptosis was observed on days 1-5, followed by goblet cell metaplasia on days 2-5 and crypt epithelial and glandular epithelial regenerative hyperplasia on days 4-5. Gene expression profiling of duodenal samples from BZ-dosed animals revealed significant time-dependent deregulation of mRNAs for various panendocrine, hormonal, and transcription factor genes. Somatostatin, secretin, mucin, CCK, and gastrin mRNAs were elevated twofold or more by day 2, and a number of candidate \"early-predictive\" genes were altered on days 1-2, remaining changed for 4-5 days; these included Delta1, NeuroD, Hes1-regulated adipsin, and the Hes-regulated transcriptional activator of gut secretory lineage differentiation, the rat homolog of Drosophila atonal, Rath1. Western blotting of fecal protein from BZ-and DBZ-dosed animals exhibited increased levels of both anti-Rath1 reactive protein and anti-adipsin reactive proteins, confirming their potential value as noninvasive biomarkers of intestinal goblet metaplasia.", 
    "38": "The substrate depletion method is a popular approach used for the measurement of in vitro intrinsic clearance (CL(int)). However, the incubation conditions used in these studies can vary, the consequences of which have not been systematically explored. Initial substrate depletion incubations using rat microsomes and hepatocytes were performed for eight benzodiazepines: alprazolam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam, and triazolam. Subsequent predictions of in vivo CL(int) (ranging from 3 to 200 ml/min) and hepatic clearance (CL(H)) (ranging from 0.3 to 15 ml/min) demonstrated that the general predictive ability of this approach was similar to that of the traditional metabolite formation method. A more detailed study of the substrate depletion profiles and CL(int) estimates indicated that the concentration of enzyme used is of particular importance. The metabolism of triazolam, clonazepam, and diazepam was monoexponential at all cell densities using hepatocytes; however, with microsomes, biphasic depletion was apparent, particularly at higher microsomal protein concentrations (2-5 mg/ml). Enzyme activity studies indicated that enzyme loss was more pronounced in the microsomal system (ranged from 8 to 65% activity after a 1-h incubation) compared with the hepatocyte system (approximately 100% activity after a 1-h incubation). For clonazepam (a low clearance substrate), these biphasic profiles could be explained by loss of enzyme activity. To ensure accurate predictions of in vivo CL(int) and CL(H) when using the substrate depletion approach, based on the results obtained for this class of drugs, it is recommended that low enzyme concentrations and short incubation times are used whenever possible.", 
    "39": "Knowledge of strain differences in drug metabolism is important for the selection of animals for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological studies. Hepatic microsomes from Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Brown Norway (BN) rats had 300-fold higher diazepam p-hydroxylation activity than Dark Agouti (DA) and Wistar (W) rats at a low diazepam concentration (3 microM). Kinetic studies indicated that diazepam p-hydroxylation in SD and BN rats proceeded with lower K(m) and higher V(max) values than it did in DA and W rats. However, the expression levels of cytochrome P450 CYP2D1, the reported enzyme for diazepam p-hydroxylation, did not cosegregate with the activity. These results suggest the presence of a new high-affinity diazepam p-hydroxylation enzyme other than CYP2D1 in SD and BN rats. DA rats showed 3- and 2-fold higher diazepam 3-hydroxylation and N-desmethylation activities, respectively, than the other rat strains. In agreement with this, DA rat liver microsomes had a higher expression of CYP3A2, which is responsible for diazepam 3-hydroxylation and partly responsible for N-desmethylation. Values of CL(int) (V(max)/K(m)) indicated that p-hydroxy-diazepam is the major metabolite in SD and BN rats, whereas 3-hydroxy-diazepam is the major metabolite in DA and W rats. The sum of the CL(int) in each strain was in the order of DA > SD = BN > W. Strain differences in the pharmacodynamics of diazepam between SD and DA rats may be due to these differences in diazepam metabolism. We found that both the rate of elimination of diazepam and the major metabolic pathways in diazepam metabolism differed among the different rat strains due to polymorphic expression of the two enzymes involved in diazepam metabolism.",

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of a decaffeinated green tea (DGT; Camellia sinensis) extract on the activity of the drug-metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P-450 2D6 and 3A4. Probe drugs dextromethorphan (30 mg, CYP2D6 activity) and alprazolam (ALPZ; 2 mg, CYP3A4 activity) were administered orally to healthy volunteers (n = 11) at baseline, and again after treatment with four DGT capsules/day for 14 days. Each DGT capsule contained 211 +/- 25 mg of green tea catechins and <1 mg of caffeine. Dextromethorphan metabolic ratios (DMRs) and alprazolam pharmacokinetics were determined at baseline and after DGT treatment. There were no significant differences in ALPZ pharmacokinetics at baseline and after DGT treatment (all P values >/= 0.05; maximum concentration in plasma, 33 +/- 8 versus 34 +/- 13 ng/ml; time to reach maximum concentration in plasma, 1.4 +/- 1.2 versus 1.4 +/- 1.2 h; area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, 480 +/- 119 versus 510 +/- 107 h. ng. ml(-1); half-life of elimination, 12.3 +/- 1.7 versus 13.1 +/- 3.4 h). The DMR was 0.053 +/- 0.045 at baseline and 0.041 +/- 0.032 after DGT supplementation (P > 0.05). The plasma concentration of the green tea flavonoid, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, reached 1.3 +/- 1.8 microM 2 h after DGT treatment. Our results indicate that DGT is unlikely to alter the disposition of medications primarily dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways of metabolism.",

    "54": "In critically ill patients, adequate analgesia and sedation increase comfort, reduce stress response and facilitate diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Analgesia and sedation may also have a beneficial impact on morbidity, particularly by reducing pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia, and delirium or agitation with subsequent accidental extubation. The method and depth of analgesia and sedation should be adapted to the needs of the individual patient. While evaluation of analgesia and sedation is important, technical tools for assessment are generally unreliable. Accordingly, management of these patients is best guided by simple clinical scores, though there is no consensus on how frequently pain and sedation should be evaluated. While there is some degree of consensus on what constitutes an acceptable level of pain relief, the same is not true of sedation, with the attendant risk of over-sedation. Analgesia and sedation are performed chiefly by pharmacological means. The first step includes adequate analgesia, usually with opioids. There is no evidence of a difference in efficacy between opioids as far as clinically relevant outcomes are concerned. However, there is some evidence that more sophisticated methods of opioid administration, such as patient-controlled analgesia, may improve pulmonary outcomes. In Europe, midazolam and propofol are most frequently used for sedation of the critically ill. Regular evaluation of the effect of these drugs and subsequent adaptation of dosage are more important than the choice of specific analgesics and hypnotics. Implementation of guidelines for rational analgesia and sedation would help to reduce patients' length of stay in the intensive care unit.", 
    "55": "Tonic inhibition plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability because it sets the threshold for action potential generation and integrates excitatory signals. Tonic currents are known to be largely mediated by extrasynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors that are persistently activated by submicromolar concentrations of ambient GABA. We recently reported that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, the clustering of synaptic GABA(A) receptors significantly affects synaptic transmission. In this work, we demonstrated that the clustering of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors modulated tonic inhibition. Depolymerization of the cytoskeleton with nocodazole promoted the disassembly of extrasynaptic clusters of delta and gamma(2) subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. This effect was associated with a reduction in the amplitude of tonic currents and diminished shunting inhibition. Moreover, diffuse GABA(A) receptors were less sensitive to the GAT-1 inhibitor NO-711 and to flurazepam. Quantitative analysis of GABA-evoked currents after prolonged exposure to submicromolar concentrations of GABA and model simulations suggest that clustering affects the gating properties of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. In particular, a larger occupancy of the singly and doubly bound desensitized states can account for the modulation of tonic inhibition recorded after nocodazole treatment. Moreover, comparison of tonic currents recorded during spontaneous activity and those elicited by exogenously applied low agonist concentrations allows estimation of the concentration of ambient GABA. In conclusion, receptor clustering appears to be an additional regulating factor for tonic inhibition.", 
    "56": "The stability of 46 drugs in postmortem femoral blood stored for one year at -20 degrees C was investigated. The drugs included benzodiazepines, antidepressants, analgetics and hypnotics. For seven drugs we found a significant change in the concentration between the first and second analysis. Five substances; ethanol, desmethylmianserin, 7-amino-nitrazepam, THC and zopiclone showed a decrease in the concentration whereas the concentrations of two substances; ketobemidone and thioridazine increased. However, the changes observed were not of such an order that it would affect the interpretation in normal forensic casework. We also investigated the possible influence of potassium fluoride on the concentrations of the 46 drugs in vitreous humor after storage for one year. For two substances, ethanol and zopiclone, there were significantly lower concentrations in the samples without potassium fluoride. Furthermore, we also studied the correlation between the concentrations in femoral blood and vitreous humor. For 23 substances there was a significant difference between the concentrations in the vitreous humor and femoral blood. Significant correlations between the concentrations in these two specimens were found for 23 substances, indicating that vitreous humor can be an alternative specimen when blood samples are not available, provided that such correlation exists for the particular substance. Statistical analysis also revealed a correlation between the degree of protein binding of the different drugs and percentage of vitreous/femoral blood concentrations.",

There were 30 cases of autopsies in the Madrid region where citalopram and other psychoactive substances (psychotropic drugs, alcohol, opiates) were detected in the corpses. The postmortem citalopram levels in relation to the manner and mechanism of death were evaluated, and a significant difference between the toxic and nontoxic cases (p < 0.01) was found. We studied the citalopram blood levels alone and along with other psychoactive products, and these cases were then further divided into those where the compounds were at deadly levels and those which were not. We found a range of citalopram levels between 0.37 and 0.83 microg/mL in which some cases were associated with citalopram toxicity and others were not. Citalopram blood levels of less than 0.35 microg/mL did not lead to fatal poisoning when it was the sole substance detected.",

In this randomized, cross-over experimental study, seven adult chinchillas, five females, two males [515 +/- 70 (SD) g] were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: group 1 [midazolam, medetomidine and fentanyl (MMF), flumazenil, atipamezole and naloxone (FAN); MMF-FAN] received 1.0 mg/kg midazolam, 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine and 0.02 mg/kg fentanyl i.m., and for reversal 0.1 mg/kg flumazenil, 0.5 mg/kg atipamezole and 0.05 mg/kg naloxone s.c. after 45 min; group 2 (MMF) 1.0 mg/kg midazolam, 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine and 0.02 mg/kg fentanyl i.m.; group 3 [xylazine/ketamine (X/K)] 2.0 mg/kg xylazine and 40.0 mg/kg ketamine i.m.; and group 4 [medetomidine/ketamine (M/K)] 0.06 mg/kg medetomidine and 5.0 mg/kg ketamine i.m. Reflexes were judged to determine anaesthetic stages and planes. Anaesthesia with X/K and M/K was associated with a prolonged surgical tolerance and recovery period.

Without reversal, MMF produced anaesthesia lasting 109 +/- 16.3 min. All combinations decreased respiratory and heart rate but compared with X/K and M/K, respiratory and cardiovascular complications were less in the MMF groups. Focussing on the clinical relevance of the tested combinations, completely reversible anaesthesia showed two major advantages: anaesthesia can be antagonized in case of emergency and routinely shortens recovery. In small animals particularly these advantages lead to less complications and discomfort and thus often can be lifesaving. As all analgesic components (medetomidine and fentanyl) are reversed, postoperative analgesia should be provided before reversal of anaesthesia.",

METHOD: Empirical reports with data on at least benzodiazepine or antidepressant drug use in samples of older persons published between 1990 and 2001 (n = 32) were identified from major databases and analyzed to determine which factors are most frequently associated with psychotropic drug use in multivariate analyses. Methodological aspects were also examined. RESULTS: Most reports used probability samples of users and non-users and employed cross-sectional designs. Among variables considered in 5 or more reports, race, proximity to health centers, medical consultations, sleep complaints, and health perception were virtually always associated to drug use. Gender, mental health, and physical health status were associated in about two-thirds of reports. Associations with age, marital status, medication coverage, socioeconomic status, and social support were usually not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The large variety of methods to operationalize drug use, mental health status, and social support probably affected the magnitude of observed relationships. Employing longitudinal designs and distinguishing short-term from long-term use, focusing on samples of drug users exclusively, defining drug use and drug classes more uniformly, and utilizing measures of psychological well-being rather than only of distress, might clarify the nature of observed associations and the direction of causality. Few studies tested specific hypotheses. Most studies focused on individual characteristics of respondents, neglecting the potential contribution of health care professionals to the phenomenon of psychotropic drug use among seniors.",

State anxiety was reduced to a greater extent in the propofol group (mean difference 10 (SD 4) mm; p = 0.010. Propofol patients recovered quicker (mean difference 7 (SD 1.4) min; p = 0.001).

The aim of this study was to establish whether the use of a combination of intravenous midazolam with inhalation agents (nitrous oxide alone or in combination with sevoflurane) was any more likely to result in successful completion of treatment than midazolam alone. A further aim was to evaluate the clinical viability of these techniques as an alternative to general anaesthesia. In total, 697 children too anxious for management with relative analgesia and requiring invasive dental procedure for which a general anaesthetic would usually be required, were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups given the following interventions: group 1 - a combination of inhaled medical air and titrated intravenous midazolam, group 2 - a combination of inhaled 40% nitrous oxide in oxygen and titrated intravenous midazolam, and group 3 - a combination of an inhaled mixture of sevoflurane 0.3% and nitrous oxide 40% in oxygen with titrated intravenous midazolam. The primary outcome measure was successful completion of the intended dental treatment with a co-operative child responsive to verbal commands. In group 1, 54% (94/174 children) successfully completed treatment. In group 2, 80% (204/256 children) and in group 3, 93% (249/267 children) completed treatment.

Functional and symptomatic recovery from episodes of bipolar disorder is frequently less complete than previously considered, and disability is often profound. Although manic episodes are the distinguishing feature of bipolar disorder, it appears that depression is the predominant mood disturbance and that much of the functional impairment associated with bipolar disorder results from this.

Studies with absence seizure-prone rats and transgenic mice have taken advantage of differences in the subunit compositions of GABA(A) receptors in the two thalamic cell populations to clarify thalamocortical rhythm generating mechanisms and explain the antiabsence activity of benzodiazepines. The relevance of this work is highlighted by the recent finding of a mutation in the GABA(A) receptor gamma2 subunit in a family with childhood absence seizures.", 
    "93": "Although several studies examined factors that influence conscious sedation, investigation was limited into the gender and age. The aim of this prospective study is to identify the clinical variables of successful conscious sedation during gastrointestinal endoscopy. A total of 300 subjects who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy were enrolled in a prospective fashion. They completed a questionnaire to assess height, weight, drinking, smoking, education level, recent medication, past medical history, previous experience of conscious sedation, preprocedural anxiety, and apprehension about the procedure. Efficacy of sedation and amnesia were evaluated by the subject and the endoscopist. Amnesic and sedative effects were proportionally related with age (p<0.0001). Preprocedural anxiety level was higher in women (p=0.0062), younger subjects (p=0.035), slender subjects (p=0.041), and in those without previous experience of conscious sedation (p=0.0034). This anxiety level was also related to increased pain (p=0.0026) and alertness (p=0.0003) during the procedure. Lower dose of midazolam is needed for sedation in older subjects. Subjects with a high level of preprocedural anxiety such as women, younger subjects, slender subjects, and those without previous experience of conscious sedation should be sedated with great caution because generally, they complain of much more severe pain and alertness during the procedure.",

    "95": "The neuroprotective effect of diazepam has been demonstrated in global ischemia models in vivo and in vitro [Neuroscience (2000) 471]. We studied the effect of diazepam on lesion volume in a photothrombotic model of focal brain ischemia in the rat, and the relation of such effect to time of drug administration. For this purpose we induced photochemically a focal brain lesion, and added diazepam 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally just before, at 1 and 4 h after lesion induction. After 24 h the rats were decapitated, and lesion volumes of 27 diazepam-treated rats were compared with that of 12 controls. Treated animals had a significant smaller lesion volume than controls, except those who received diazepam before induction of the lesion. We conclude that diazepam is neuroprotective in focal brain ischemia even when administered up to 4 h after ischemia onset.", 
    "96": "A binding pocket for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) within the transmembrane helices of the TRH receptor type 1 (TRH-R1) has been identified based on experimental evidence and computer simulations. To determine the binding site for a competitive inverse agonist, midazolam, three of the four residues that directly contact TRH and other residues that restrain TRH-R1 in an inactive conformation were screened by mutagenesis and binding assays. We found that two residues that directly contact TRH, Asn-110 in transmembrane helix 3 (3.37) and Arg-306 in transmembrane helix 7 (7.39), were important for midazolam binding but another, Tyr-282 in transmembrane helix 6 (6.51), was not. A highly conserved residue, Trp-279 in transmembrane helix 6 (6.48), which was reported to be critical in stabilizing TRH-R1 in an inactive state but not for TRH binding, was critical for midazolam binding. We used our previous model of the unoccupied TRH-R1 to generate a model of the TRH-R1/midazolam complex. The experimental results and the molecular model of the complex suggest that midazolam binds to TRH-R1 within a transmembrane helical pocket that partially overlaps the TRH binding pocket. This result is consistent with the competitive antagonism of midazolam binding. We suggest that the mechanism of inverse agonism effected by midazolam involves its direct interaction with Trp-279, which contributes to the stabilization of the inactive conformation of TRH-R1.", 
    "97": "Antagonists of 2-amino-3(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl) propionic acid (AMPA) receptors can considerably reduce brain damage after cerebral ischemia, but effectiveness of selective AMPA antagonists has been questioned recently. Therefore, we evaluated the antiischemic efficacy of [+/-]-7-acetyl-5-[4-aminophenyl]-7,8-dihydro-8-cyano-8-methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-h]-2,3-benzodiazepine (EGIS-8332) and GYKI 53405, two selective, non-competitive AMPA antagonists in two rat models of focal cerebral ischemia. Permanent focal ischemia was produced by electrocoagulation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). EGIS-8332 and GYKI 53405 were administered 30 min after MCA occlusion at doses of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg i.p. In transient focal ischemia, MCA was occluded for 1 h and reperfused for 24 h using the intraluminal filament technique and the compounds were given at 3x10 mg/kg i.p. 60, 120 and 180 min following occlusion. In permanent focal ischemia, EGIS-8332 decreased the volume of cerebral infarction both at 10 mg/kg i.p. (36.4%, p<0.01) and at 3 mg/kg i.p. (26.4%, p<0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. GYKI 53405 produced a similar antiischemic effect at 10 mg/kg i.p. (36.4%, p<0.01), but it was ineffective at 3 mg/kg i.p. (6.5%, p=0.57). In transient focal ischemia, EGIS-8332 reduced the volume of necrotic brain tissue (38.7%, p<0.01) and GYKI 53405 was similarly effective (32.6%, p<0.05). Both compounds afforded neuroprotection in the cortical and subcortical regions of the MCA territory. Selective, non-competitive AMPA antagonists administered after the ischemic insult can produce effective neuroprotective action in experimental models of focal cerebral ischemia; therefore, these compounds may be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of stroke and neurodegenerative disorders.", 
    "98": "The ability to make repetitive non-invasive measurements of gastric emptying of nutritive solids in awake, unstressed mice is highly desirable. The aim of the present study was to develop such a technique using nuclear scintigraphy and diets differing in triglyceride content. Awake mice were accustomed to light restraint and to feeding cooked, egg white (0.00 g fat g(-1)), whole egg (0.10 g fat g(-1)), or egg yolk (0.31 g fat g(-1)). Gastric emptying of each diet was measured by labelling the test meals with Technetium(99m) Mebrofenin and using a conventional gamma camera equipped with a high resolution, parallel hole collimator. Gastric emptying of cooked whole egg was also determined following administration of either vehicle or CCK A receptor antagonist, devazepide. The half-emptying time (t(1/2)) significantly increased with increasing triglyceride content from 14 +/- 5 min to 51 +/- 6 min and 82 +/- 4 min for egg white, whole egg and egg yolk, respectively. Administration of devazepide significantly decreased t(1/2) of whole egg to 28 +/- 2 min. These results demonstrate the sensitivity and predictability of this technique in mice and importantly, provide an opportunity to alter the macronutrient or caloric content of the meal to determine effects on gastric emptying.", 
    "99": "Cannabinoids affect various behavioral processes, including emotion, learning and memory, which may be specifically regulated through the CB1 receptors. The exact role CB1 receptors play in anxiety remains unclear. Both genetic and pharmacological blockade of CB1 receptors have produced inconsistent effects on anxiety. However, these studies examined passive avoidance as an index of anxiety. In the present study, both active and passive avoidance were examined using the shock-probe burying test while CB1 receptors were blocked genetically or pharmacologically. In the shock-probe burying test, anxiety is reflected by increased burying (increased active avoidance) and increased freezing (increased passive avoidance). In addition, probe-contacts may reflect cognitive performance and/or passive avoidance. As there have been few studies examining mouse behavior in the shock-probe burying test, experiment 1 was designed to pharmacologically validate this model in mice. Our results indicated that administration (i.p.) of chlordiazepoxide (4 mg/kg) or FG7412 (5 mg/kg) decreased and increased burying behavior, respectively, without affecting freezing or the number of probe contacts. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that both CB1 knockout mice and mice injected (i.p.) with 3 or 10 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg, of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A had lower burying scores, fewer contacts with the probe and similar freezing times compared with wild-type mice and mice injected with vehicle (experiments 2 and 3). Collectively, these results suggest that CB1 receptor blockade reduces some, but not all, aspects of anxiety. The decrease in probe contacts induced by CB1 receptor blockade may be due to enhanced cognition.", 
    "100": "Previous reports have demonstrated the anxiolytic effect of the potent and systemically active metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 (mGlu5) receptor antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) in rodents. Here, we present evidence for the anxiolytic activity of a novel mGlu5 receptor antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP), in rats and compare its profile to the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam. MTEP occupied mGlu5 receptors in a dose-dependent manner with essentially full receptor occupancy at the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg, i.p.). At doses appropriate for mGlu5 receptor-mediated effects, MTEP significantly reduced fear-potentiated startle and increased punished responding in a modified Geller-Seifter conflict model consistent with an anxiolytic-like profile. In both models, the magnitude of the anxiolytic-like response was similar to that seen with diazepam. In contrast, MTEP decreased unpunished responding to a lesser extent than diazepam and had no effect on rotarod performance when administered either alone or in combination with ethanol. Repeated dosing with MTEP in this model eliminated the increase in punished responding observed with acute dosing. The present results suggest that mGlu5 receptor antagonists lack the side effects seen with benzodiazepines, such as sedation and ethanol interaction, and provide insight into a possible role for mGlu5 receptor antagonists in the modulation of mood disorders.", 
    "101": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors are pentameric proteins of which the majority is composed of two alpha subunits, two beta subunits and one gamma subunit. It is well documented that two different types of alpha subunits can exist in a singles GABAA receptor complex. However, information on the abundance of such GABAA receptors is rather limited. Here we tested whether mice containing the His to Arg point mutation in the alpha1, alpha2, or alpha3 subunit at positions 101, 101, and 126, respectively, which render the respective subunits insensitive to diazepam, would be suitable to analyze this issue. Immunodepletion studies indicated that the His to Arg point mutation solely rendered those GABAA receptors totally insensitive to diazepam binding that contain two mutated alpha subunits in the receptor complex, whereas receptors containing one mutated and one heterologous alpha subunit not carrying the mutation remained sensitive to diazepam binding. This feature permitted a quantitative analysis of native GABAA receptors containing heterologous alpha subunits by comparing the diazepam-insensitive binding sites in mutant mouse lines containing one mutated alpha subunit with those present in mouse lines containing two different mutated alpha subunits. The data indicate that the alpha1alpha1-containing receptors with 61% is the most abundant receptor subtype in brain, whereas the alpha1alpha2 (13%), alpha1alpha3 (15%), alpha2alpha2 (12%), alpha2alpha3 (2%), and alpha3alpha3 combinations (4%) are considerably less expressed. Only within the alpha1-containing receptor population does the combination of equal alpha subunits (84% alpha1alpha1, 7% alpha1alpha2, and 8% alpha1alpha3) prevail, whereas in the alpha2-containing receptor population (46% alpha2alpha2, 36% alpha2alpha1, and 19% alpha2alpha3) and particularly in the alpha3-containing receptor population (27% alpha3alpha3, 56% alpha3alpha1, and 19% alpha3alpha2), the receptors with two different types of alpha subunits predominate. This experimental approach provides the basis for a detailed analysis of the abundance of GABAA receptors containing heterologous alpha subunits on a brain regional level.",

    "110": "Several anesthetics are known to cause respiratory and cardiovascular depression in humans and animals; but, these diverse effects have not been extensively investigated in laboratory rodents. The objective of this study is to choose a suitable anesthetic combination for use in surgical models eg. coronary artery ligation in rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with three different drugs viz. diazepam-ketamine (DK) (2.5 mg/Kg, intraperitoneally (i.p); 50 mg/Kg, i.p), xylazine-ketamine (XK) (5 mg/Kg i.p; 50 mg/Kg i.p) and thiopentone (T) (40 mg/Kg i.p) and the respiratory and cardiovascular functions were assessed after coronary artery ligation. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygen saturation percentage (O2 sat (%)), arterial blood pH and rectal body temperature were studied in detail. During the anesthetic regime, HR was lower till 60 min in XK and T ligated group (333 +/- 6; 304 +/- 8 beats/min) and it was near normalcy in the case of DK ligated group (394 +/- 6 beats/min). Significant respiratory depression was particularly reflected in the T ligated group with an increase in PaCO2 at 30 min (40.32 +/- 2.64 mmHg), which decreased to 38.2 +/- 2.23 mmHg at 60 min. Throughout the investigation, DK showed the least overall effects compared to XK and T on respiratory functions.

    "111": "The present studies determined whether blockade of M(1)-like muscarinic or nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the dorsomedial striatum affects acquisition or reversal learning of a response discrimination. Testing occurred in a modified cross-maze across two consecutive sessions. In the acquisition phase, a rat learned to turn to the left or to the right. In the reversal learning phase, a rat learned to turn in the opposite direction as required during acquisition. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of the M(1)-like muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine infused into the dorsomedial striatum on acquisition and reversal learning. Experiment 2 examined the effects of the nicotinic cholinergic antagonist, mecamylamine injected into the dorsomedial striatum on acquisition and reversal learning. Bilateral injections of pirenzepine at 10 microg, but not 1 microg, selectively impaired reversal learning. Analysis of the errors indicated that pirenzepine treatment did not impair the initial shift, but increased reversions back to the original response choice following the initial shift. Bilateral injections of mecamylamine, 6 or 18 microg, did not affect acquisition or reversal learning. The results suggest that activation of M(1) muscarinic cholinergic receptors, but not nicotinic cholinergic receptors, in the dorsomedial striatum is important for facilitating the flexible shifting of response patterns.", 
    "112": "The selective non-peptide NK(1) receptor antagonist NKP608 has been shown to exert potent anxiolytic-like effects in the rat and gerbil social interaction tests. In vitro binding of NKP608 in cortical, striatal and rest-of-brain tissue samples from mice, rats and gerbils indicated comparable pIC(50) values for rats and mice (in all three tissues) and only slightly higher values for gerbils. It would therefore be expected that doses previously found to produce anxiolytic-like effects in rats and gerbils would also be active in mice. The present study evaluated NKP608 in one of the most widely-used animal models of anxiety, the mouse elevated plus-maze. Two consecutive experiments were conducted in which the effects of NKP608 (0.0003-10.0 mg/kg, p.o.) were compared to those produced by the prototypical benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 15 mg/kg, p.o.). Ethological scoring methods were used to provide comprehensive behavioural profiles for each compound. In both experiments, acute CDP treatment resulted in significant anxioselective effects, i.e., reductions in measures of open arm avoidance without any alteration in general activity levels (closed arm entries and rearing). Although the results of Experiment 1 (0.001-10.0 mg/kg NKP608) suggested a weak anxiolytic-like action of NKP608 at 0.001 mg/kg (significant increase in percent open arm entries), Experiment 2 failed both to replicate this effect or to find any behavioural activity at lower (0.0003 mg/kg) or higher (0.03 mg/kg) doses. Present findings suggest that the anxiolytic efficacy of this NK(1) receptor antagonist may be test-specific and thus limited to particular subtypes of anxiety. These new data are also discussed in relation to the general difficulty of relating the behavioural profiles of NK(1) receptor antagonists to their potency at NK(1) receptors.", 
    "113": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptors is the target for the most widely prescribed sleep medicines. It is a ligand-gated ion channel, activated by the amino acid neurotransmitter GABA, which normally results in hyperpolarization of neurons leading to reduced action potential firing, and thereby a reduction in neuronal activity. It has a rich pharmacology with a number of separate modulator binding sites. The best studied of these is the benzodiazepine site. Modulation of GABA(A) receptor activity by benzodiazepines produces sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities. Short half-life benzodiazepines such as triazolam have been particularly useful in treating insomnia, but concerns have been raised regarding tolerance potential and dependence liability of classical benzodiazepines, which has led to reduced prescribing of these agents. In recent years, the treatment of sleep disorders has moved towards the use of non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics. These agents act at the same site on the GABA(A) receptor, but feature less of the problems associated with classical benzodiazepines. Recent progress in our understanding of the diversity and pharmacology of GABA(A) receptor subtypes has provided a rational explanation for the efficacy of these compounds. Findings from preclinical studies reveal promising avenues for the design of better therapeutics in the near future.", 
    "114": "Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) selectively disrupt conditioned avoidance responding (CAR)--a feature that distinguishes them from all other psychotropics. It is thought that this effect reflects their effect on motor initiation; however, this conclusion is questionable because most studies it relies on have often examined avoidance responding under APD treatment, and tested animals with preshock stimuli followed by the footshock. APD-induced CAR effects are confounded by APDs' motor effects and by the presence of footshock. The objective of this study was to evaluate the motor initiation hypothesis by testing animals without drug and under extinction conditions. In Experiment 1, we administered haloperidol, clozapine or chlordiazepoxide (an anxiolytic as a pharmacological control) during the acquisition phase of CAR, but tested animals 2 days later. The APD-induced CAR disruption was present even in the absence of the drug and footshock. In Experiment 2, we first trained rats to a learning criterion, and then subjected them to 4 days of CAR extinction training under drug or vehicle. In the subsequent CAR extinction tests, the rats previously treated with APDs still showed significantly lower avoidance responses. In both experiments, the effects of haloperidol and clozapine were distinct from those of chlordiazepoxide. These data suggest that APD-induced CAR decreases cannot be explained as the unconditioned motor impairment effects of APDs, but probably reflect a dopamine-blockade-mediated change in incentive motivation.", 
    "115": "A delayed nonmatching-to-position task (DNMPT) in a water maze (nine trials per day, 10 days) was used to investigate the role of muscarinic acetylcholinergic receptor (mAChR) in nicotine-facilitated spatial memory in Wistar rats. The index of spatial memory was determined by the number of correct choices made in choice swim (CS) and the time taken to complete the swim in the correct CS. Diazepam (6 mg kg(-1) ip, daily) significantly impaired choice accuracy and increased the swim time for correct CS. In contrast, when nicotine (2 mg kg(-1) sc, twice daily) and diazepam were administered simultaneously in the last three sessions of training, the choice accuracies of CS were similar to controls and significantly higher than in the diazepam group. However, the swim times for correct CS were longer in the nicotine+diazepam group than in controls. Atropine (30 mg kg(-1) ip, daily) significantly decreased the choice accuracies of CS. The choice accuracies of CS swim times for correct CS in the atropine group did not differ significantly from those in the nicotine+atropine group, in which nicotine (2 mg kg(-1) sc, twice daily) and atropine were given simultaneously. These results show that nicotine improves memory performance when the functions of mAChRs are normal; when the mAChRs are blocked, nicotine does not enhance spatial memory. Therefore, mAChRs are involved in the spatial memory-enhancing effect of nicotine.",

    "122": "gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is endogenous inhibitory transmitter that, when administered in pharmacological doses, has sedative-hypnotic properties. It is used in anaesthesia for the treatment of narcolepsy/catalepsy and in alcohol/opioid detoxification treatment regimens. Based on its purported anabolic effects, GHB use became established among bodybuilders. As the euphorigenic effects of GHB became publicised, attendees at dance clubs and rave parties began to use it alone or in combination with other psychoactive drugs. Following the ban of GHB in 1990, several precursor products (e.g. gamma-butyrolactone, butanediol) became widely used as replacement drugs until their ultimate proscription from lawful use in 2000. GHB and its precursors, like most sedative-hypnotic agents, can induce tolerance and produce dependence. Although many GHB users will experience a mild withdrawal syndrome upon drug discontinuation, those with chronic heavy GHB use can experience severe withdrawal. This syndrome clinically resembles the withdrawal syndrome noted from alcohol and other sedative-hypnotic drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines). Distinct clinical features of GHB withdrawal are its relatively mild and brief autonomic instability with prolonged psychotic symptoms. Patients with fulminant GHB withdrawal require aggressive treatment with cross-tolerant sedative hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines.",

To estimate the influence of flumazenil on the endogenous Bz system related respiratory control, we studied the effect of flumazenil and diazepam on the neural activity and the respiratory response caused by a brief (60 sec) respiratory arrest (RA) manifested in the hypoglossal nerve (HG) and the phrenic nerve (PH) activities in rabbits.", 
    "125": "Experiments were performed on adult rabbits which were vagotomized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated with 50% N2O, 50% oxygen and 0.5% sevoflurane. We evaluated and compared the effects of the sequential administrations of flumazenil and diazepam on the peak amplitude (AMP) as well as the root mean square (RMS) of HG and PH, and respiratory cycle (Tc).", 
    "126": "Flumazenil by itself increased HG activity more than PH activity with no influence on Tc. But it was not dose-related. Previous administration of flumazenil in total dose of 0.25 mg x kg(-1) could not prevent the anticipated respiratory depression caused by diazepam 2.0 mg x kg(-1). These depressions are greater in HG activity than in PH activity. Additional flumazenil 0.15 mg x kg(-1) following the administration of diazepam promptly reversed these inhibitory effects on HG activity beyond the control level. The same dose of flumazenil, however, did not reverse PH activity sufficiently. RA response was characterized by raised AMPs and augmented RMSs (deltaAMPs, deltaRMSs) with marked prolongation in Tc (deltaTc). Flumazenil and diazepam did not seem to have any influence upon these RA responses. There was a significant change in cardiovascular parameters with the tested dosages of flumazenil and diazepam, but the change was in the normal physiological range.", 
    "127": "These results suggest the possibility that the endogenous benzodiazepine system is likely to play an inhibitory role in the regulation of respiration, especially in the maintenance of upper airway patency but the system is unrelated to the chemosensitive-respiratory control.", 
    "128": "Hot water epilepsy (HWE) is a rare form of reflex epilepsy caused by bathing with hot water. In this paper, we describe three cases with hot water epilepsy. It occurs generally in children with normal psychomotor development and children continue to develop normally after seizure. HWE has usually a favorable prognosis by first avoiding lukewarm water and secondly using either intermittent oral prophylaxis with benzodiazepines or conventional AEDs.", 
    "129": "Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) knockout mice exhibited decreased innervation of the small intestine by vagal intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) and reduced food satiation. Recent findings suggested this innervation was increased in NT-4 knock-in (NT-4KI) mice. Therefore, to further investigate the relationship between intestinal IGLEs and satiation, meal patterns were characterized using solid and liquid diets, and cholecystokinin (CCK) effects on 30-min solid diet intake were examined in NT-4KI and wild-type mice. NT-4KI mice consuming the solid diet exhibited reduced meal size, suggesting increased satiation. However, compensation occurred through increased meal frequency, maintaining daily food intake and body weight gain similar to controls. Mutants fed the liquid diet displayed a decrease in intake rate, again implying increased satiation, but meal duration increased, which led to an increase in meal size. This was compensated for by decreased meal frequency, resulting in similar daily food intake and weight gain as controls. Importantly, these alterations in NT-4KI mice were opposite, or different, from those of NT-4 knockout mice, further supporting the hypothesis that they are specific to vagal afferent signaling. CCK suppressed short-term intake in mutants and controls, but the mutants exhibited larger suppressions at lower doses, implying they were more sensitive to CCK. Moreover, devazepide prevented this suppression, indicating this increased sensitivity was mediated by CCK-1 receptors. These results suggest that the NT-4 gene knock-in, probably involving increased intestinal IGLE innervation, altered short-term feeding, in particular by enhancing satiation and sensitivity to CCK, whereas long-term control of daily intake and body weight was unaffected.", 
    "130": "Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of drug abuse. It is more likely to develop in the setting of chronic lung disease or debility in those with limited respiratory reserve. Drugs may acutely precipitate respiratory failure by compromising respiratory pump function and/or by causing pulmonary pathology. Polysubstance overdoses are common, and clinicians should anticipate complications related to multiple drugs. Impairment of respiratory pump function may develop from central nervous system (CNS) depression (suppression of the medulla oblongata, stroke or seizures) or respiratory muscle fatigue (increased respiratory workload, metabolic acidosis). Drug-related respiratory pathology may result from parenchymal (aspiration-related events, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, infectious and non-infectious pneumonitides), airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage), or pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infections, hemorrhage, and vasoconstrictive events). Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused drugs that may induce events leading to acute respiratory failure. While decontamination and aggressive supportive measures are indicated, specific therapies to correct seizures, metabolic acidosis, pneumothorax, infections, bronchospasm, and agitation should be considered. Drug-related respiratory failure when due to CNS depression alone may portend well, but in patients with drug-related significant pulmonary pathology, a protracted course of illness may be anticipated.", 
    "131": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and their activation may induce cell death. PBRs are expressed in human pancreatic islets, and cytokine-induced damage is accompanied by changes in their properties. We hypothesized that PBRs can have a role in human islet physiopathology, and evaluated the effects of prolonged exposure to two specific PBR ligands, PK11195 and Ro5-4864 on the function and survival of isolated human islets.", 
    "132": "Isolated human islets were prepared from the pancreas of 25 multiorgan cadaveric donors and incubated for 12 h in the presence of PK11195 or Ro5-4864. Insulin secretion studies and apoptosis experiments were then performed, together with assessment of intracellular pathways involved in islet cell function and survival.", 
    "133": "Islets were prepared by enzymatic digestion and density gradient purification. Insulin secretion was assessed by the batch incubation method, and glucose oxidation was evaluated by the use of D-[U-(14)C]glucose. Apoptosis was studied using the TUNEL technique, ELISA methods, and electron microscopy evaluation. PCR experiments were performed by the use of specific primers.", 
    "134": "Glucose-stimulated insulin release was significantly lower after exposure to PK11195 than after exposure to Ro5-4864. This was accompanied by reduced glucose oxidation and no major change of insulin or GLUT-1 mRNA expression. Apoptosis was higher in PK11195-exposed islets, and electron microscopy demonstrated the involvement of beta-cells. The apoptotic effects were prevented by bongkrekic acid and low-dose cyclosporin A, which stabilize the mitochondrial membrane, and were associated with no evident change of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) or Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression. Caspase inhibition markedly reduced the amount of apoptosis, and the role of these proteases was confirmed by the increased activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9.", 
    "135": "Prolonged binding to PBRs may cause human beta-cells functional damage and apoptosis, a phenomenon which is prevented by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane; occurs without changes of iNOS, Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA expression; and involves caspase activation. These results suggest an involvement of PBRs in human pancreatic beta-cell function and survival.", 
    "136": "A novel packing material, 3-(4-sulfo-1,8-naphthalimido)propyl-modified silyl silica gel (SNAIP), was prepared for the use as a stationary phase of capillary electrochromatography (CEC). The sulfonic acid groups on SNAIP stationary phase contributed to the generation of electroosmotic flow (EOF) at low pH and served as a strong cation-exchanger. In CEC with SNAIP, a mixed-mode separation was predicted, comprising hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions as well as electrophoretic migration process. In order to understand the retention mechanism on SNAIP, effects of buffer pH, concentration, and mobile phase composition on EOF mobility and the retention factors of barbiturates and benzodiazepines were systematically investigated. Moreover, the retention behavior of barbiturates on SNAIP was investigated and compared with those on octadecyl silica (ODS), phenyl-bonded silica, and 3-(1,8-naphthalimido)propyl-modified silyl silica gel to confirm the presence of pi-pi interaction on its retention mechanism. It was observed that a column efficiency was more than 85,000 N/m for retained compounds and the relative standard deviations for the retention times of EOF marker, thiourea, and five barbiturates were below 2.5% (n = 4). Under an applied voltage of 20 kV and a mobile phase consisted of 5 mM phosphate (pH 3.8) and 40% methanol, the baseline separation of five barbiturates was achieved within 3 min.", 
    "137": "This study compares etomidate with midazolam for prehospital rapid-sequence intubation (RSI).", 
    "138": "The authors conducted a retrospective review of consecutive intubations at a university-based air medical program from January 1995 to December 2000. Exclusion criteria were patients not undergoing RSI, age <15 years, and incomplete chart data. Outcome measures included intubation success, incidence of hypotension, and percentage of change in heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP).", 
    "139": "The intubation success rate was 110 out of 112 (98%) with etomidate, and 96 out of 97 (99%) with midazolam. Mean ages, patient gender distributions, and initial SBPs and HRs did not differ between the two groups. The mean dose of etomidate was 24 mg, the mean percentage of change in HR was -1% (95% confidence interval [CI], -6 to 4), and the mean percentage of change in SBP was 2% (95% CI, -3 to 7). The mean dose of midazolam was 3.5 mg, the mean percentage of change in HR was 1% (95% CI, -5 to 7), and the mean percentage change in SBP was 3% (95% CI, -3 to 9). The number of hypotensive episodes with etomidate (7 out of 74) compared with midazolam (3 out of 56) did not differ significantly (Fisher's exact test, p=0.51).", 
    "140": "Intubation success rate was very high with both etomidate (98%) and midazolam (99%). There was no statistically significant mean percentage of change in SBP or HR with either agent. The authors found a low incidence of hypotension with both agents, although the mean dose of midazolam used was considerably less than typically recommended for induction.", 
    "141": "A child of 14 months accidentally swallowed a portion of an Ecstasy pill. Forty minutes after ingestion, he started a generalized convulsion. He also presented hyperthermia (38 degrees C), hypertension, tachycardia (130 bpm), ventricular extrasystoles, tachypnea (50 rpm), and mydriasis. At the hospital 5 hours later, the urine levels of amphetamine/metamphetamine were >16 mg/L. He was treated with general support measures and benzodiazepines intravenously and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. During the first 12 hours, he continued with hypertension, tachycardia, and long periods of trigeminy, without hemodynamic repercussion. He was discharged fully recovered. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis (8 hours after ingestion) showed a serum level of 3,4 methylenedioximethylamphetamine (MDMA) of 0.591 mg/L. The 3 cases described in the literature have shown a good evolution of Ecstasy poisoning in toddlers and infants, despite an initial critical situation. Regarding adults, the toddler intoxication seems to present symptoms sooner (20 to 30 minutes), having as an initial manifestation convulsions. However, great care must be taken on accidental ingestion of these attractive design pills.", 
    "142": "Following a recent description of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-fused human muscarinic M1 receptors and Bodipy-labeled pirenzepine, we synthesized seven fluorescent derivatives of this antagonist in order to further characterize ligand-receptor interactions. These compounds carry Bodipy [558/568], Rhodamine Red-X [560/580], or Fluorolink Cy3 [550/570] fluorophores connected to pirenzepine through various linkers. All molecules reversibly bind with high affinity to M1 receptors (radioligand and energy transfer binding experiments) provided that the linker contains more than six atoms. The energy transfer efficiency exhibits modest variations among ligands, indicating that the distance separating EGFP from the fluorophores remains almost constant. This also supports the notion that the fluorophores may bind to the receptor protein. Kinetic analyses reveal that the dissociation of two Bodipy derivatives (10 or 12 atom long linkers) is sensitive to the presence of the allosteric modulator brucine, while that of all other molecules (15-24 atom long linkers) is not. The data favor the idea that these analogues might interact with both the acetylcholine and the brucine binding domains.", 
    "143": "Recent studies have revealed a rise in the use of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs as well as the improper use thereof in Western countries. This study is aimed at ascertaining the pattern of use of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs in Spain within the 1995-2002 period.", 
    "144": "The data related to the use of medications was taken from the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs' ECOM (Medicinal Products Consumption) database, which includes information on the use of medications delivered through the community pharmacies and reimbursed by the National Health System. The data are expressed in Defined Daily Doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day.", 
    "145": "The use of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs rose from 39.71 Defined Daily Doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day in 1995 to 62.02 in 2002. Throughout the period under study, benzodiazepines having a medium-range half-life (8-24 h.) were those most used, especially lorazepam, alprazolam and lormetazepam. The active ingredient having shown the greatest drop in use was flunitrazepam.", 
    "146": "Although the use of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs has undergone a considerable rise in recent years in Spain, the pattern of use has shown no major changes.", 
    "147": "Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent disorder that is frequently comorbid with major depressive disorder. Pharmacotherapies, including SSRIs and benzodiazepines, as well as cognitive-behavioral interventions, are effective for many patients, helping them to attain a higher quality of life.", 
    "148": "The well-known amplitude reduction of the P300 appears to be unaffected by the treatment with classical antipsychotics in schizophrenia, whereas the effects of atypical neuroleptics on this event-related potential are less understood. The study of these changes could help in deciding whether the P300 amplitude reduction in schizophrenia is a trait or state marker of that illness and in better describing the effect of atypical antipsychotics on altered cognitive functions. We present a prospective longitudinal study of P300 amplitude and latency before and after 6 months' treatment with olanzapine in 11 patients with schizophrenia. A healthy control group (n = 30) was also studied. Overall, no significant changes, either in amplitude or in latency as measured at Pz and Fz electrodes, were found when comparing the pre- and postolanzapine conditions, despite the overall improvement in positive and negative symptoms. Nevertheless a direct specific association was observed between a P300 amplitude increase with olanzapine and the improvement in negative symptoms. These data would suggest that P300 amplitude reduction in schizophrenia may be relatively independent from clinical state and treatment, thus constituting a trait marker of schizophrenia. Our data also suggest that, in addition to this, some further changes in P300 amplitude might depend on the clinical state of the patients."
