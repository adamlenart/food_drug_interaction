The analytes were extracted from blood by protein precipitation followed by solid phase extraction, and from urine and bile by liquid-liquid extraction and cleanup using a PSA solid phase extraction cartridge. This method was applied to a medico-legal autopsy case, in which the deceased had been prescribed QZP approximately 3 weeks before his death. In blood, the concentrations of free DOQ (160\u00b17 ng/mL for heart blood and 181\u00b112 ng/mL for femoral blood) were the highest of all the analytes and in agreement with the concentration at a steady state. This indicates that the deceased consecutively received QZP for at least several days until the concentrations reached approximately the same level as that in the steady state. An extremely high concentration of total HOQ (the sum of conjugated and free HOQ) in bile was also found (56,200\u00b11900 ng/mL). This accumulation of HOQ in bile is probably due to enterohepatic circulation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the concentrations of QZP and its metabolites in biological matrices can provide more information about the amount and frequency of QZP administration.",

    "34": "Epilepsy is recognized as one of the most common and serious neurological disorder affecting 1-2% of the world\u05f3s population. The present study demonstrates that systemic administration of 3-butyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazolidine-4-one-2,2-dioxide (DIOXIDE), a synthetic compound bioisoster of trimethadione and phenytoin (classical anticonvulsants), elicits a dose dependent anticonvulsant response in mice submitted to the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole seizure test (scPTZ). Among various factors supposed to play role in epilepsy, oxidative stress and reactive species have strongly emerged. The protection exerted by DIOXIDE over the extent of brain oxidative damage produced by PTZ was determined, by measuring the levels of lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione and the activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Psychiatric disorders represent frequent comorbidities in persons with epilepsy. In this report, the potential anxiolytic and antidepressant activities of DIOXIDE were evaluated in several widely used models for assessing anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in rodents. Although DIOXIDE did not evidence anxiolytic activity at the doses tested, it revealed a significant antidepressant-like effect. Preliminary studies of its mechanism of action, by means of its capacity to act via the GABAA receptor (using the [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding assay in vitro and the picrotoxin test in vivo) and the Na(+) channel (using the alkaloid veratrine, a voltage-Na(+) channel agonist) demonstrated that the anticonvulsant effect is not likely related to the GABAergic pathway and the antidepressant-like effect could be due to its Na(+) channel blocking properties. The results for DIOXIDE suggested it as a new anticonvulsant-antioxidant and antidepressant compound that deserves further development.",

Brain/blood ratio at all sampling points up to 8 h following intranasal administration of OZPMME compared to intravenous OZPME was found to be five to six times higher signifying larger extent of distribution of the OZP in brain. Drug targeting efficiency and direct drug transport were found to be highest for intranasal OZPMME, compared to intravenous OZPME. Furthermore, rabbit brain scintigraphy also demonstrated higher intranasal uptake of the OZP into the brain. This investigation demonstrates a prompt and larger extent of transport of OZP into the brain through intranasal OZPMME, which may prove beneficial for treatment of schizophrenia.",

The main difference in the prevalence of patients receiving a PIM according to the two versions of Beers' criteria involved prescriptions of benzodiazepines for insomnia or agitation, chronic use of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, prescription of antipsychotics in people with dementia and oral iron at dosage higher than 325\u00a0mg/day. Prescription of PIMs was not associated with a higher risk of adverse clinical events, re-hospitalization and all-cause mortality at 3-month follow-up in both univariate and multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age, sex and CIRS comorbidity index.",

    "47": "The inhibitory \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system is associated with the regulation of normal cognitive functions and dysregulation has been reported in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and addictions. Investigating the role of GABA in both health and disease has been constrained by difficulties in measuring acute changes in synaptic GABA using neurochemical imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate whether acute increases in synaptic GABA are detectable in the living human brain using the inverse agonist GABA-benzodiazepine receptor (GABA-BZR) positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [(11)C]Ro15-4513. We examined the effect of 15 mg oral tiagabine, which increases synaptic GABA by inhibiting the GAT1 GABA uptake transporter, on [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding in 12 male participants using a paired, double blind, placebo-controlled protocol. Spectral analysis was used to examine synaptic \u03b11 and extrasynaptic \u03b15 GABA-BZR subtype availability in brain regions with high levels of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding. We also examined the test-retest reliability of \u03b11 and a5-specific [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding in a separate cohort of 4 participants using the same spectral analysis protocol. Tiagabine administration produced significant reductions in hippocampal, parahippocampal, amygdala and anterior cingulate synaptic \u03b11 [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding, and a trend significance reduction in the nucleus accumbens. These reductions were greater than test-retest reliability, indicating that they are not the result of chance observations. Our results suggest that acute increases in endogenous synaptic GABA are detectable in the living human brain using [(11)C]Ro15-4513 PET. These findings have potentially major implications for the investigation of GABA function in brain disorders and in the development of new treatments targeting this neurotransmitter system.", 
    "48": "Monocytes have been isolated from patient's blood and directly radiolabelled in vitro using a variety of radiopharmaceuticals such as 99mTc-HMPAO, 111In-oxine, 99mTc-colloids and 18F-FDG. Overall, the best labeling results were obtained using 99mTc-HMPAO. The wide availability of 99mTc and of the ligand HMPAO in kit-formulation makes it the most versatile procedure for imaging localized inflammation using in-vitro labeling. Injection of 99mTc-HMPAO labeled monocytes in adult patients has proven safe with an effective dose of 0.011 mSv/Mbq, equivalent to that of 99mTc-HMPAO labeled mixed white blood cells. Furthermore, in a proof of concept studies, in-vitro labeled monocytes were shown to specifically accumulate in the bowels of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease as well as in inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Inversely, the decrease in disease activity of inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated by Adalimumab could not be substantiated using 99mTc-HMPAO labelled monocytes suggesting this type of treatment does not reduce monocyte influx. In spite of their wide availability, in-vitro labeling procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming. Furthermore, cell activation may occur during the labeling process and it cannot be excluded that the radiopharmaceuticals used for labelling interfere with ongoing cellular processes. As such, various authors turned towards the development of radiopharmaceuticals for in-vivo labeling of both monocytes and more importantly macrophages, many of which were subsequently validated in animal models. Targets studied in this regard include amongst others the folate receptor, the mannose receptor, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor as well as more general characteristics of macrophages such as phagocytosis. Various of these novel molecules appear promising and clinical studies using these radiopharmaceuticals are awaited in the near future. Some of these radiopharmaceuticals also reached the clinical stage, respectively the translocating protein targeting radiopharmaceutical 11C-PK11195 and the folate receptor targeting radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-EC20. Uptake of 11C-PK11195 in inflamed joints and sites of atherosclerosis in patients proved to be directly related to the number of peripheral benzodiazepine binding receptors available as well as to the severity of ongoing inflammation. Comparable results were obtained using 99mTc-EC20 in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In spite of these promising results, additional studies are warranted demonstrating that in vivo, quantitative visualization of monocyte trafficking and accumulation of M1 or M2 macrophage subtypes in sites of ongoing inflammation by means of SPECT and PET will contribute to a better understanding of human inflammatory diseases as well as to diagnosis, treatment planning and the development of targeted treatment strategies.",

However, there are very limited studies utilizing endpoints such as analgesic requirements to provide supporting evidence for these claims. The primary purpose of this retrospective study was to compare opioid analgesic requirements in trauma patients receiving nonconcurrent dexmedetomidine and propofol for sedation while being weaned from mechanical ventilation.

In vitro data suggest ridaforolimus is a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. A model-based evaluation suggested an increase in midazolam area under the curve (AUC(0- \u221e)) of between 1.13- and 1.25-fold in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of ridaforolimus. The pharmacokinetic interaction between multiple oral doses of ridaforolimus and a single oral dose of midazolam was evaluated in an open-label, fixed-sequence study, in which cancer patients received a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam followed by 5 consecutive daily single oral doses of 40 mg ridaforolimus with a single dose of 2 mg midazolam with the fifth ridaforolimus dose. Changes in midazolam exposure were minimal [geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals: 1.23 (1.07, 1.40) for AUC(0-\u221e) and 0.92 (0.82, 1.03) for maximum concentrations (C(max)), respectively]. Consistent with model predictions, ridaforolimus had no clinically important effect on midazolam pharmacokinetics and is not anticipated to be a perpetrator of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) when coadministered with CYP3A substrates. Model-based approaches can provide reasonable estimates of DDI liability, potentially obviating the need to conduct dedicated DDI studies especially in challenging populations like cancer patients.",

They affect detection, registration, and information processing, problem solving, and decision-making processes, and they also affect emotional and social aspects. The objective of this research was to clarify three closely related issues that are significant for traffic safety: the prevalence of psychotropic drugs on driving, the most frequently used psychotropic drugs to treat depression, anxiety, insomnia, or any tranquilizers (whether it is a medical prescription or self-medication), and finally, provide a further understanding of the socio-demographic and psycho-social characteristics of drivers related to the psychotropic drugs consumption in Spain.",

FEDAA1106 (N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-methoxybenzyl) acetamide) is a selective ligand for TSPO-18kDa (also known as peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), which is expressed by activated macrophages. We compared 18F-FEDAA1106 and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG, a marker of glucose metabolism) for positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of vascular inflammation. This was tested using a murine model in which focal inflammation was induced in the carotid artery via placement of a constrictive cuff. Immunostaining revealed CD68-positive cells (macrophages) at a disturbed flow site located downstream from the cuff. Dynamic PET imaging using 18F-FEDAA1106 or 18F-FDG was registered to anatomic data generated by computed tomographic (CT)/CT angiography. Standardized uptake values were significantly increased at cuffed compared to contralateral arteries using either 18F-FEDAA1106 (p < .01) or FDG (p < .05). However, the 18F-FEDAA1106 signal was significantly higher at the inflamed disturbed flow region compared to the noninflamed uniform flow regions, whereas differences in FDG uptake were less distinct. We conclude that 18F-FEDAA1106 can be used in vivo for detection of vascular inflammation. Moreover, the signal pattern of 18F-FEDAA1106 corresponded with vascular inflammation more specifically than FDG uptake.",

Clobazam can be used for the treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaus syndrome. Phenobarbital is effective but poorly tolerated because of its effects on cognition. Use of the ketogenic diet to decrease seizure frequency has been beneficial in some affected individuals. Prevention of secondary complications: Use of protective helmets by individuals with atonic seizures or myoclonic-astatic epilepsy. Surveillance: Serial neuropsychological evaluation for neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral deterioration; EEG monitoring for new or different seizure types. Agents/circumstances to avoid: AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin, which can induce or increase myoclonic seizures; phenytoin, which can induce choreoathetosis. Activities in which a sudden loss of consciousness could lead to injury or death (e.g., bathing, swimming, driving, or working/playing at heights). Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should receive counseling regarding the risks and benefits of the use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy; the advantages and disadvantages of increasing maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation to 4000 \u00b5g daily; the effects of pregnancy on anticonvulsant metabolism; and the effect of pregnancy on maternal seizure control. Other: The AEDs clobazam and stiripentol, used in treatment of SMEI, are not FDA-approved for this use in the US. Sleep deprivation and illness can exacerbate seizures.

The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants varies by phenotype: the percentage of probands with an SCN1A-related seizure disorder and an affected parent decreases as the severity of the phenotype in the proband increases; thus, most SCN1A-related SMEI and ICE-GTC are the result of de novo mutation. Each child of an individual with an SCN1A-related seizure disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant; however, the risk of developing seizures is less than 100% because of reduced penetrance. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.", 
    "127": "Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by motor dysfunction that resembles cerebral palsy, cognitive and behavioral disturbances, and uric acid overproduction (hyperuricemia). The most common presenting features, hypotonia and developmental delay, are evident by age three to six months. Affected children are delayed in sitting and most never walk. Within the first few years, extrapyramidal involvement (e.g., dystonia, choreoathetosis, opisthotonos) and pyramidal involvement (e.g., spasticity, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar reflexes) become evident. Cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances emerge between ages two and three years. Persistent self-injurious behavior (biting the fingers, hands, lips, and cheeks; banging the head or limbs) is a hallmark of the disease. Overproduction of uric acid may lead to deposition of uric acid crystals or calculi in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. Gouty arthritis may occur later in the disease. Related disorders with less severe manifestations include hyperuricemia with neurologic dysfunction but no self-injurious behavior and hyperuricemia alone, sometimes with acute renal failure.",

Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) enzyme activity less than 1.5% of normal in cells from any tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, lymphoblasts) is diagnostic. HPRT1 is the only gene known to be associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.",

Baclofen or benzodiazepines for spasticity; physical, behavioral, psychiatric, protective equipment to reduce complications from self-injury and other deleterious behaviors. Prevention of secondary compliations: Adjustment of the dose of allopurinol is required to minimize the complication of nephrolithiasis; virtually any reduction of hyperuricemia will prevent urate nephropathy. Surveillance: Monitoring for early signs of self-injury; medical history, plasma uric acid concentration, urinary oxypurine excretion to monitor for signs of renal stones. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Probenecid and other uricosuric drugs designed to reduce the serum concentration of uric acid; periods of relative dehydration, which may increase risk for renal stones or urate nephropathy with resulting oliguria/anuria. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Prenatal testing or testing of at-risk males immediately after birth enables prompt initiation of allopurinol therapy; establishing the carrier status of at-risk female relatives through genetic testing may allow for early treatment that reduces their risk for gout in later years.",

The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the carrier status of the mother. Carrier females have a 50% chance of transmitting the HPRT1 pathogenic variant in each pregnancy. Sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are carriers. Thus, with each pregnancy, a carrier female has a 25% chance of having an affected male, a 25% chance of having a carrier female, and a 50% chance of having an unaffected male or female.

Ketamine, however, is well known to be associated with a variety of adverse effects including nausea, dizziness, and psychotomimetic phenomena. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous reports on the use of ketamine for ECT anesthesia, with varied assessments on how prominent these adverse effects are in the ECT situation. Ketamine has received a resurgence of interest as an ECT anesthetic of late owing to its established independent antidepressant effects and to theoretical reasons why it might lessen the cognitive adverse effects of ECT. In this case series, the author reviews the experience with 14 patients who had undergone ECT who were switched to ketamine as anesthetic from methohexital at the preference of the treating anesthesiologist. All 14 patients spontaneously reported a strong preference not to be given ketamine again due to bothersome adverse effects. The latter consisted of either vestibular-type symptoms (nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo) or psychotomimetic effects (dissociative phenomena). It is concluded that ketamine is not free of adverse effects when used as an ECT anesthetic. Electroconvulsive therapy clinicians should be vigilant about assessing for these effects when ketamine is used, and consideration should be given to using a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or midazolam at seizure termination when ketamine anesthesia is used to prevent bothersome adverse effects seen upon awakening.",

We performed a retrospective cohort study including 911,017 pregnant women in the period from 1997 to 2010. Information was retrieved from The Danish Birth Registry and The Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics to identify pregnant women redeeming a prescription of HBRAs. Results. We identified 2,552 women exposed to HBRAs during pregnancy, increasing from 0.18% in 1997 to 0.23% in 2010. Compared to unexposed women, exposed women were characterized by being older, with higher BMI, in their third or fourth parity, of lower income and education level, more frequently smokers, and more likely to be comedicated with antipsychotic, anxiolytic, or antidepressant drugs (P < 0.0001). Conclusion. Women using HBRAs during their pregnancy differ from unexposed women in socioeconomic factors and were more likely to receive comedication.

A minimum list of 80 analytes to be monitored in such cases has been proposed by the Society of Forensic Toxicologists (SOFT) including the recommended minimum performance limits (RMPL). In the present study, two liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based screening procedures, one in positive (method I) and one in negative (method II) electrospray ionization mode were developed and validated. Gradient elution was performed on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column after protein precipitation of the urine samples. Detection was carried out in the scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode monitoring two transitions per compound. A total of 100 analytes (91 basic in method I and nine acidic in method II) could be identified using the described procedure. No interferences were observed in 30 tested blank urine samples. The RMPLs were achieved for all analytes and ranged from 1 ng/mL for fentanyl to 10 \u03bcg/mL for \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).

The relative standard deviations of ME were below 25 % for the vast majority of analytes. Results for urine specimens from nine authentic DFC cases were always negative with exception of drugs prescribed to the victims. Reanalysis with the developed procedure of 24 urine samples, with a positive screening result during routine clinical toxicology analysis, confirmed the routine findings. In an excretion study after a single oral doxylamine dose (30 mg), the parent drug and its nor metabolite could be detected in urine specimens from a young female volunteer for 10 days.

No significant difference was observed between the percentage positive samples in cosmetically treated hair to those in urine at both the 95% and 99% significance level for amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, and methadone. Significant difference was found between the positivity rates of cannabinoids in cosmetically treated hair and that in urine indicating urine to be a better alternative to the use of the hair matrix even when cosmetically treated. The opposite was observed for the alcohol consumption marker ethyl glucuronide (EtG) for which the positivity rate in cosmetically treated hair was twice that in urine samples. Particularly for alcohol abstinence monitoring, as for the rehabilitative driving licence re-granting medical and psychological assessment (MPA) programme in Germany, it seems that ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair presents a much better alternative than urine testing, even when cosmetically treated hair is analyzed.

Analytical methods used were accredited for forensic purposes at the cut-offs defined by the German driving licence re-granting medical and psychological assessment (MPA) guidelines. Considering only the drug classes for which at least 10 positive samples were detected, the positivity rate in non-treated hair was highest for alcohol (4.50%; measured using EtG at concentrations \u2265 7 pg/mg hair), followed by THC (2.00%), cocaine (1.75%), and amphetamine (0.59%). While the 1st to 99th percentile range was significantly lower for drugs in treated, compared to non-treated hair, no significant change was observed for EtG. Additionally, no significant difference in the positivity rate was observed between treated hair and non-treated hair for both drugs and EtG. This study is the first attempt to evaluate the influence of cosmetic treatment, mainly dying, on the positivity rate for both drugs and EtG in hair samples submitted routinely for abstinence testing and the first to indicate that dyed and eventually bleached hair is not necessarily useless in detecting drugs and/or alcohol consumption, thus making coloured hair analysis still useful, often being the only possibility to prove such misuse.",

Our objective was to explain the pharmacokinetics of OLAI to provide clinical insight. Simulation models and data from clinical trials are presented. Olanzapine concentrations were observed immediately upon injection. Half-life was \u223c30 days, controlled by the slow rate of intramuscular absorption rather than the 30-h elimination rate-based half-life of oral olanzapine. As each injection builds on the drug still being released from previous injections, concentrations increase gradually until a steady state is reached after \u223c3 months. Concentrations were similar to oral olanzapine and proportional to the dose; the average steady-state concentrations (10th-90th percentile) for the 150, 210, and 300 mg/2-week doses were 16-32, 15-55, and 20-67 ng/ml, respectively, and those for the 300 and 405 mg/4-week doses were 19-48 and 19-62 ng/ml, respectively. Peak concentrations most often occurred at 2-4 days after injection. Peak-to-trough fluctuation was greater for the 4-week dosing interval than the 2-week one, with no apparent clinical ramifications for these differences. Trough concentrations were above the lower end of the therapeutic range, even at the first injection. Long-term use up to 6 years indicated no additional accumulation.

Here, we tested for sex differences in response to anxiogenic stimuli following a 30-min diazepam (1.0mg/kg) pre-treatment in male and female rats showing high (HAn) and low (LAn) anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze. Acute diazepam administration resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior only in HAn males as demonstrated by a significant increase in percent open arm time in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Immunohistochemical analysis for parvalbumin (PV; a calcium-binding protein that selectively stains GABAergic neurons) in central amygdala (CeA), caudate putamen (CPu) and the hippocampus indicated the number of GABAergic interneurons in these areas differed across sex and anxiety trait. In the CPu, females had significantly more PV-immunoreactive (IR) cells than males, and LAn females had greater PV-IR neurons than HAn females. In the CeA, males displayed an increased number of PV-IR neurons compared to females, with no differences found between LAn and HAn. Further, trait differences were evident in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, regardless of sex. Taken together, these data suggest that gonadal hormones and trait anxiety may influence the sensitivity to the anti-anxiety effects of diazepam and these differences may be due in part to the distribution of GABA-containing interneurons.",

A DUID arrest is in most cases related to aberrant or risky driving and might therefore be regarded as a proxy for a drug related traffic crash. The 'cases' were 2738 drivers arrested on suspicion of drugged driving from April 2008 to March 2009 with blood alcohol concentrations below the legal limit of 0.2g/L; 794 were arrested due to involvement in road traffic crashes, whereas 1944 were arrested for other reasons, mainly dangerous driving, suspected impairment when stopped in traffic controls, or because of phone calls to the police from other road users or observers. The 'controls' were 9375 random drivers in normal traffic, also with alcohol concentrations below this limit. Blood samples from 'cases' and oral fluid samples from 'controls' were analyzed for 15 drugs that have legislative concentration limits in Norway, in addition to two other commonly detected psychoactive drugs. The most prevalent illicit drug in the control group was tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 0.58%), which was also commonly found in samples from drivers arrested due to road crash (15.6%) or arrested for other reasons (21.8%). Amphetamine/methamphetamine was most prevalent among arrested drivers involved in crashes (30.6%) and drivers arrested for other reasons (56.9%), whereas only 0.18% of the control group was positive for amphetamine/methamphetamine. The single-use substances which gave highest OR for police arrest were amphetamine/methamphetamine, alprazolam, clonazepam and oxazepam. The majority of the alprazolam and clonazepam findings were probably due to non-therapeutic use of medicinal drugs purchased on the illegal market. Combinations of two or more drugs yielded higher ORs than the use of single substances; combinations of amphetamine/methamphetamine and benzodiazepines gave the highest risk.",

Valproate-induced hyperammonaemia or hepatic encephalopathy was considered and the drug was withheld following which there was a dramatic improvement. Paradoxically, the liver function tests and serum ammonia were normal. However, a complete reversal of encephalopathy, on withdrawal of the drug, strongly suggested an adverse drug reaction (ADR) due to valproic acid. Marginal elevation of serum valproic acid prompted us to use the Naranjo ADR probability score to confirm the diagnosis.

This change in practice resulted in an average reduction of almost 60% in length of hospital stay and a 66% reduction in the amount of chlordiazepoxide used in detoxification, as well as highlighting that 10% of the sample group did not display any signs of withdrawal and did not require any medication. Even with these reductions, no patient post-intervention developed any severe signs of withdrawal phenomena, such as seizures or delirium tremens. The savings to the trust (The Pennine Acute Hospital Trust) are obvious,but the development of a consistent, quality service will lead to fewer long-term negative effects for patients that can be caused by detoxification.

Stress-related psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gastrointestinal function disorder, such as IBS. However, the mechanism of IBS still remains unknown. Curcumin is a biologically active phytochemical presents in turmeric and has pharmacological actions that benefit patients with depression and anxiety. Our study found that IBS rats showed depression- and anxiety-like behaviors associated with decreased 5-HT (serotonin), BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and pCREB (phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein) expression in the hippocampus after chronic acute combining stress (CAS). However, these decreased parameters were obviously increased in the colonic after CAS. Curcumin (40 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time of forced swimming and the number of buried marbles in behavioral tests of CAS rats. Curcumin also decreased the number of fecal output and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores in response to graded distention. Moreover, curcumin increased serotonin, BDNF and pCREB levels in the hippocampus, but they were decreased in the colonic of CAS rats. 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190 reversed the effects of curcumin on behaviors and the changes of intestine, pCREB and BDNF expression, which are related to IBS. These results suggested that curcumin exerts the effects on IBS through regulating neurotransmitters, BDNF and CREB signaling both in the brain and peripheral intestinal system.",

MR imaging study revealed brain atrophy in the bilateral mesial temporal lobe, consistent with senile dementia of Alzheimer type. Despite her tongue movements seemingly developing to the generalized convulsion, EEG study did not indicate epileptiform discharges corresponding to this movement. Although antiepileptic drug therapy was effective, we needed polytherapy to control this movement. Paroxysmal tongue movements were previously reported in cases of epilepsy, brain tumor, and stroke, observed bilaterally in most cases. This episodic tongue movement would be rare in terms of the clear laterality. The etiology of this movement was presumed as focal seizure, palatal tremor, dyskinesia or others, but was undetermined. Episodic movements involving tongue decrease the quality of daily life especially in the elderly. Therefore, we should pay more attention to it and try to treat it earlier.",

The cumulative literature describes the experiences of 860 patients with various forms of SE treated with intravenous VPA. The overall response rate to abrogate SE was 70.9% (601/848; 95% confidence interval [CI] 67.8-73.9). Response rates to intravenous VPA were better in children than in adults and did not differ between the SE types. The most commonly reported effective doses were between 15 and 45 mg/kg in bolus (6 mg/kg/min) followed by 1-3 mg/kg/h infusion. Safety studies of intravenous VPA administration in patients with SE showed a low incidence of adverse events overall (<10%), mainly dizziness, thrombocytopenia, and mild hypotension, which was independent of infusion rates. Of note, good cardiovascular and respiratory tolerability was observed in these studies, even at high doses and fast infusion rates (up to 30 mg/kg at 10 mg/kg/min), despite multiple morbidities or other antiepileptic drugs. The most serious concern relates to the possibility of acute encephalopathy, sometimes related to hepatic abnormalities or hyperammonemia.",

Within the first 6 days of training, 7 servicemen presented with severe, acute anxiety/panic with typical accompanying signs of sympathetic activation and no classic symptoms of acute mountain sickness (including headache). Four had a history of well-controlled psychiatric diagnoses. Invariably, cardiopulmonary and neurological evaluations were unrevealing, and acute cardiopulmonary events were excluded within limits of expeditionary diagnostic capabilities. All patients responded clinically to oxygen, rest, and benzodiazepines, returning to baseline function the same day. The unexpected onset of 7 cases of acute anxiety symptomatology coincident with recent arrival at moderate-to-high altitudes represents a highly unusual incidence and temporal distribution, suggestive of hypobaric hypoxemia as the proximal cause. We propose acute hypoxic physiological anxiety (AHPA) as a unique member of the spectrum of altitude-associated neurological disorders. Recognition of AHPA is particularly relevant in a military population; warfighters with anxiety spectrum diagnoses may have a recognizable and possibly preventable vulnerability.",

The paucity of effects on most CNS-PD parameters also indicates a mitigated side effect pattern, with potentially lower cognitive and neurophysiological side effect burden than non-selective benzodiazepines.", 
    "221": "When tested on the treadmill mice do not display a graded increase of heart rate (HR), but rather a sharp shift of cardiovascular indices to high levels at the onset of locomotion. We hypothesized that under test conditions cardiovascular reaction to physical load in mice is masked with stress-associated HR increase. To test this hypothesis we monitored mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate in C57BL/6 mice after exposure to stressful stimuli, during spontaneous locomotion in the open-field test, treadmill running or running in a wheel installed in the home cage. Mice were treated with \u03b21-adrenoblocker atenolol (2mg/kg ip, A), cholinolytic ipratropium bromide (2mg/kg ip, I), combination of blockers (A+I), anxiolytic diazepam (5mg/kg ip, D) or saline (control trials, SAL). MAP and HR in mice increased sharply after handling, despite 3weeks of habituation to the procedure. Under stressful conditions of open field test cardiovascular parameters in mice were elevated and did not depend on movement speed. HR values did not differ in I and SAL groups and were reduced with A or A+I. HR was lower at rest in D pretreated mice. In the treadmill test HR increase over speeds of 6, 12 and 18m/min was roughly 1/7-1/10 of HR increase observed after placing the mice on the treadmill. HR could not be increased with cholinolytic (I), but was reduced after sympatholytic (A) or A+I treatment. Anxiolytic (D) reduced heart rate at lower speeds of movement and its overall effect was to unmask the dependency of HR on running speed. During voluntary running in non-stressful conditions of the home cage HR in mice linearly increased with increasing running speeds. We conclude that in test situations cardiovascular reactions in mice are governed predominantly by stress-associated sympathetic activation, rendering efforts to evaluate HR and MAP reactions to workload unreliable.",

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who failed to satisfactorily respond to \u2265 2 different antidepressants for \u2265 6 weeks within the current MDD episode were acutely treated for 6-8 weeks, followed by stabilization (12 weeks) on OFC. Those who remained stable were randomized to OFC or fluoxetine for up to 27 weeks.

A total of 444 patients were randomized 1:1 to OFC (N=221) or fluoxetine (N=223). Time-to-relapse was significantly longer in OFC-treated patients compared with fluoxetine-treated patients (p<0.001). Treatment-emergent weight gain and some mean and categorical fasting metabolic changes were significantly greater in OFC-treated patients. Clinically significant weight gain (\u2265 7%) was observed in 55.7% of patients who remained on OFC throughout the study, including the relapse-prevention phase (up to 47 weeks). There were no significant differences between patients treated with OFC and fluoxetine in extrapyramidal symptoms or serious adverse events. We believe this is the first controlled relapse-prevention study in subjects with TRD that supports continued use of a second-generation antipsychotic beyond stabilization. A thorough assessment of benefits and risks (in particular metabolic changes) associated with continuing treatment with OFC or fluoxetine must be done based on individual patient needs.", 
    "231": "Despite advances in the treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders with atypical antipsychotics (AAPs), there is still need for compounds with improved efficacy/side-effect ratios. Evidence from challenge studies suggests that the assessment of gating functions in humans and rodents with naturally low-gating levels might be a useful model to screen for novel compounds with antipsychotic properties. To further evaluate and extend this translational approach, three AAPs were examined. Compounds without antipsychotic properties served as negative control treatments. In a placebo-controlled, within-subject design, healthy males received either single doses of aripiprazole and risperidone (n=28), amisulpride and lorazepam (n=30), or modafinil and valproate (n=30), and placebo. Prepulse inhibiton (PPI) and P50 suppression were assessed. Clinically associated symptoms were evaluated using the SCL-90-R. Aripiprazole, risperidone, and amisulpride increased P50 suppression in low P50 gaters. Lorazepam, modafinil, and valproate did not influence P50 suppression in low gaters. Furthermore, low P50 gaters scored significantly higher on the SCL-90-R than high P50 gaters. Aripiprazole increased PPI in low PPI gaters, whereas modafinil and lorazepam attenuated PPI in both groups. Risperidone, amisulpride, and valproate did not influence PPI. P50 suppression in low gaters appears to be an antipsychotic-sensitive neurophysiologic marker. This conclusion is supported by the association of low P50 suppression and higher clinically associated scores. Furthermore, PPI might be sensitive for atypical mechanisms of antipsychotic medication. The translational model investigating differential effects of AAPs on gating in healthy subjects with naturally low gating can be beneficial for phase II/III development plans by providing additional information for critical decision making.",

    "236": "Convulsive status epilepticus is defined as a general or focal epileptic seizure lasting longer than 5\u00a0min or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures. Status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition caused by underlying pathologies (e.g., stroke, meningitis, cerebral hypoxia, cerebral edema). In addition, patients are in danger of physical injury and impaired brain stem reflexes. This also applies to nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which is often characterized by an \"unclear loss of consciousness\". Although it can only be diagnosed by electroencephalography, it is an important differential diagnosis in the prehospital or emergency room situation, which may be decisive for the therapeutic strategy. Benzodiazepines are the first choice treatment for status epilepticus. This article summarizes a guideline-directed therapy with different pharmaceutical substances and ways of application. A pragmatic approach for limited diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in the emergency situation is presented.", 
    "237": "The anxiolytic diazepam selectively inhibits psychological stress-induced autonomic and behavioral responses without causing noticeable suppression of other central performances. This pharmacological property of diazepam led us to the idea that neurons that exhibit diazepam-sensitive, psychological stress-induced activation are potentially those recruited for stress responses. To obtain neuroanatomical clues for the central stress circuitries, we examined the effects of diazepam on psychological stress-induced neuronal activation in broad brain regions. Rats were exposed to a social defeat stress, which caused an abrupt increase in body temperature by up to 2\u00b0C. Pretreatment with diazepam (4mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the stress-induced hyperthermia, confirming an inhibitory physiological effect of diazepam on the autonomic stress response. Subsequently, the distribution of cells expressing Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was examined in 113 forebrain and midbrain regions of these rats after the stress exposure and diazepam treatment. The stress following vehicle treatment markedly increased Fos-immunoreactive (IR) cells in most regions of the cerebral cortex, limbic system, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain, which included parts of the autonomic, neuroendocrine, emotional and arousal systems. The diazepam treatment significantly reduced the stress-induced Fos expression in many brain regions including the prefrontal, sensory and motor cortices, septum, medial amygdaloid nucleus, medial and lateral preoptic areas, parvicellular paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, perifornical nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, association, midline and intralaminar thalami, and median and dorsal raphe nuclei. In contrast, diazepam increased Fos-IR cells in the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and magnocellular lateral hypothalamus. These results provide important information for elucidating the neural circuitries that mediate the autonomic and behavioral responses to psychosocial stressors.", 
    "238": "Dexmedetomidine is an \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist that causes minimal respiratory depression compared with alternative drugs. This study investigated whether combined dexmedetomidine/fentanyl offered better sedation and analgesia than midazolam/fentanyl in dental surgery. Sixty patients scheduled for unilateral impacted tooth extraction were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine and fentanyl (D/F) or midazolam and fentanyl (M/F). Recorded variables were patient preoperative anxiety scores, vital signs, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAAS) scores after drug administration, surgeon and patient degree of satisfaction, and the duration of analgesia after surgery. The OAAS scores were significantly lower for patients administered D/F compared to those who received M/F. The duration of analgesia after the surgical procedure was significantly longer in patients who received D/F (5.3 h) than in those who received M/F (4.1 h; P=0.017). The number of surgeons satisfied with the level of sedation/analgesia provided by D/F was significantly higher than for M/F (P=0.001). Therefore, dexmedetomidine/fentanyl appears to provide better sedation, stable haemodynamics, surgeon satisfaction, and postoperative analgesia than midazolam/fentanyl during office-based unilateral impacted tooth extraction."
