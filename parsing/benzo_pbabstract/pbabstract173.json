Therefore, we had covalently coupled CCK to a 10 kDa polyethylene glycol and showed that this conjugate, PEG-CCK(9), produced a significantly longer anorectic effect than unmodified CCK(9). The present study assessed the dose-dependency of this response and the effect of two selective CCK(1) receptor antagonists, with different abilities to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), on PEG-CCK(9)-induced anorexia.", 
    "1": "Food intake was measured, for up to 23 h, after i.p. administration of different doses (2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 microg kg(-1)) of CCK(9) or PEG-CCK(9) in male Wistar rats. Devazepide (100 microg kg(-1)), which penetrates the BBB or 2-NAP (3 mg kg(-1)), which does not cross the BBB, were coadministered i.p. with PEG-CCK(9) (6 microg kg(-1)) and food intake was monitored.", 
    "2": "In PEG-CCK(9)-treated rats, a clear dose-dependency was seen for both the duration and initial intensity of the anorexia whereas, for CCK(9), only the initial intensity was dose-dependent. Intraperitoneal administration of devazepide or 2-NAP, injected immediately prior to PEG-CCK(9), completely abolished the anorectic effect of PEG-CCK(9).", 
    "3": "The duration of the anorexia for PEG-CCK(9) was dose-dependent, suggesting that PEGylation of CCK(9) increases its circulation time. Both devazepide and 2-NAP completely abolished the anorectic effect of i.p. PEG-CCK(9) indicating that its anorectic effect was solely due to stimulation of peripheral CCK(1) receptors.", 
    "4": "The evidence based data to guide management in patients of benzodiazepine refractory status epilepticus (SE) is still lacking. We conducted a randomized study to evaluate the comparative effect of intravenous (IV) phenytoin and intravenous valproate (IV VA) in patients of benzodiazepine refractory SE.", 
    "5": "Hundred, age and sex matched, patients of benzodiazepine refractory SE were randomly divided into Group A (50 patients), treated with IV VA and Group B (50 patients) treated with IV phenytoin. Twelve patients, in whom SE was not controlled with a single drug, were switched over to the other group. Treatment was considered successful when all motor or EEG seizure activity ceased within 20 min after the beginning of the drug infusion and no return of seizure activity during the next 12h. Secondary study end points were adverse events to treatment, in-hospital complications and the neurological outcome at discharge.", 
    "6": "In this study, IV VA was successful in 88% and IV phenytoin in 84% (p>0.05) of patients of SE with a significantly better response in patients of SE <2h (p<0.05). The total number of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (p>0.05). There were no differences among the treatments with respect to recurrence after 12-h study period or the outcome at 7 days.", 
    "7": "IV VA is as effective as IV phenytoin. It is easy to use, better tolerated and can be used as an alternative to IV phenytoin in patients of benzodiazepine refractory SE, especially in patients of cardio-respiratory disease.

Replacements for the benzodiazepine core of an earlier lead structure 1 including 5-, 6-, and 7-membered lactams were explored. Within the 7-membered ring scaffold, phenyl substitution at various positions afforded the potent (3R)-amino-(6S)-phenyl caprolactam template.

    "9": "The aim of this article is to review the main methods of treatment of anxious and depressive disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum. To this end, we analyse recent publications about the use and efficacy of psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psychoanalytical therapy) in the perinatal period. We also review recent papers about the use of psychotropic medication during pregnancy and breast-feeding, with special emphasis on clinical trials. We particularly focus on the risk/benefit assessment of antidepressants, mood stabilisers, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, in terms of teratogenicity, and impact on neonatal adaptation and neuropsychological development. Various treatment modalities are presented and discussed. It appears that psychotherapies have proved their efficiency on most pre- and postpartum anxious and depressive disorders and represent a first line treatment in most cases. Psychopharmacological treatment is indicated for severe anxious and depressive disorders. The risks of such medication, especially antidepressants, may have been overestimated in the past. Provided reasonable precautions are taken and mothers and future mothers receive clear information on the potential risks and benefits, psychotropic medication could be more broadly prescribed during pregnancy and the breast-feeding period.", 
    "10": "Risk assessment of neurotoxicity is mainly based on in vivo exposure, followed by tests on behaviour, physiology and pathology. In this study, an attempt to estimate lowest observed neurotoxic doses after single or repeated dose exposure was performed. Differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to acrylamide, lindane, parathion, paraoxon, phenytoin, diazepam or caffeine for 72 hours. The effects on protein synthesis and intracellular free Ca2+ concentration were studied as physiological endpoints. Voltage operated Ca2+ channel function, acetylcholine receptor function and neurite degenerative effects were investigated as neurospecific endpoints for excitability, cholinergic signal transduction and axonopathy, respectively. The general cytotoxicity, determined as the total cellular protein levels after the 72 hours exposure period, was used for comparison to the specific endpoints and for estimation of acute lethality. The lowest concentration that induced 20% effect (EC20) obtained for each compound, was used as a surrogate for the lowest neurotoxic level (LOEL) at the target site in vivo. The LOELs were integrated with data on adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the compounds in physiologically-based biokinetic (PBBK) models of the rat and the lowest observed effective doses (LOEDs) were estimated for the test compounds. A good correlation was observed between the estimated LOEDs and experimental LOEDs found in literature for rat for all test compounds, except for diazepam. However, when using in vitro data from the literature on diazepam's effect on gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)A receptor function for the estimation of LOED, the correlation between the estimated and experimental LOEDs was improved from a 10,000-fold to a 10-fold difference. Our results indicate that it is possible to estimate LOEDs by integrating in vitro toxicity data as surrogates for lowest observed target tissue levels with PBBK models, provided that some knowledge about toxic mechanisms is known.", 
    "11": "This paper presents an overview of the most common sectioning patterns utilised in the analysis of hair for drug use; report on the major user groups (sectors) that currently make use of hair analysis in the United Kingdom (UK); present the results for the different drug groups analysed in samples of hair samples analysed at TrichoTech between 2001 and 2005. A total of 186,084 tests on 34,626 hair samples were performed for the commonly requested drug groups. There were 145,799 enzyme-linked Immunosorbent positive screening tests (ELISA), which were subsequently confirmed by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). The two major sectors were the Medico-Legal sector (65%) and Workplace (20%). Police (Forensics), Clinical Monitoring, Schools, Research and Insurance accounted together for the remaining 15% of the samples. Combinations of several sections patterns were requested covering periods from the most recent month up to 24 months. The most common sectioning pattern was one single section measuring 3 cm, to cover the most recent 3 months (44%), which in some cases was complemented by a further 3 cm to cover together 6 months (13%). The second most common sectioning pattern was the analysis of three sections of 1cm each to cover the most recent 3 months (28%), when a more detailed evaluation of drug use pattern was relevant. Samples collected from other areas of the body such as axilla, pubic, chest, beard and leg, constituted 6% of the samples. The analysis of monthly sections plays an important role in the evaluation and interpretation of drug use, particularly in certain Medico-Legal cases. The sectors with the highest rates of positive results were Police (Forensics) (78%), Medico-Legal (62%) and Clinical (54%). The common drugs in each group were cannabinol (27%), cocaine (25%), morphine (17%), amphetamine (13%) and diazepam (15%). The positive rate for the Workplace sector was 10%. The most common drugs detected in the Workplace samples in each group were: THC (4%), codeine (2%), cocaine (2%), MDMA (0.5%) and diazepam (0.1%). The concentration levels of drugs found in samples from the workplace were lower than in the other sectors (95% of cases). The exceptions were for dihydrocodeine and MDMA, where levels were 170 and 143% higher, respectively. However, the maximum levels detected in the Workplace samples were lower. The Medico-Legal sector is the most prevalent sector using hair analysis in the UK but the rate of Workplace sector use of hair testing is increasing. One in 10 workplace hair tests detected the presence of at least one drug, which is twice the rate of detection using urine, which is a 1 in 20 urine sample. This means that the chances of identifying people on drugs in the workplace by testing hair samples are twice as likely than urine samples.", 
    "12": "The Tottering (cacna1a(tg)) mouse arose as a consequence of a spontaneous mutation in cacna1a, the gene encoding the pore-forming subunit of the pre-synaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC, Ca(V)2.1). The mouse phenotype includes ataxia and intermittent myoclonic seizures which have been attributed to impaired excitatory neurotransmission at cerebellar granule cell (CGC) parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapses [Zhou YD, Turner TJ, Dunlap K (2003) Enhanced G-protein-dependent modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the cerebellum of the Ca(2+)-channel mutant mouse, tottering. J Physiol 547:497-507]. We hypothesized that the expression of cerebellar GABA(A) receptors may be affected by the mutation. Indeed, abnormal GABA(A) receptor function and expression in the cacna1a(tg) forebrain has been reported previously [Tehrani MH, Barnes EM Jr (1995) Reduced function of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors in tottering mouse brain: role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Epilepsy Res 22:13-21; Tehrani MH, Baumgartner BJ, Liu SC, Barnes EM Jr (1997) Aberrant expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the tottering mouse: an animal model for absence seizures. Epilepsy Res 28:213-223]. Here we show a deficit of 40.2+/-3.6% in the total number of cerebellar GABA(A) receptors expressed (gamma2+delta subtypes) in adult cacna1a(tg) relative to controls. [(3)H]Muscimol autoradiography identified that this was partly due to a significant loss of CGC-specific alpha6 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor subtypes. A large proportion of this loss of alpha6 receptors was attributable to a significantly reduced expression of the CGC-specific benzodiazepine-insensitive Ro15-4513 (BZ-IS) binding subtype, alpha6betagamma2 subunit-containing receptors. BZ-IS binding was reduced by 36.6+/-2.6% relative to controls in cerebellar membrane homogenates and by 37.2+/-3.7% in cerebellar sections. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed that the steady-state expression level of alpha6 and gamma2 subunits was selectively reduced relative to controls by 30.2+/-8.2% and 38.8+/-13.1%, respectively, alpha1, beta3 and delta were unaffected. Immunohistochemically probed control and cacna1a(tg) cerebellar sections verified that alpha6 and gamma2 subunit expression was reduced and that this deficit was restricted to the CGC layer. Thus, we have shown that abnormal cerebellar P/Q-type VGCC activity results in a deficit of CGC-specific subtype(s) of GABA(A) receptors which may contribute to, or may be a consequence of the impaired cerebellar network signaling that occurs in cacna1a(tg) mice.", 
    "13": "Cognitive dysfunctions may be a significant factor in drug-seeking behavior, reducing the efficiency of rehabilitation in opioid dependence. Neurophysiological basis of these dysfunctions is poorly understood. 21 opioid-dependent patients and 15 healthy controls with no experience of illicit drugs were studied with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Among opioid dependents 15 were benzodiazepine co-dependent. In a passive oddball paradigm, a train of 700-Hz standard tones (80%), presented to the left ear, was occasionally interrupted by infrequent deviants, which were either 600-Hz or 400-Hz pure tones or complex novel sounds. The auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and fields (AEF) were analyzed. The strength of the N1m dipoles was enhanced in patients with benzodiazepine co-dependence, but the latency of the response or the source location was not changed. A delay of mismatch negativity (MMN) response of novel tones in EEG, and delay of P3am response on the contralateral hemisphere to stimulated ear in MEG in opioid-dependent patients were observed. There were no differences in source locations or strengths of the dipoles for P1m, MMNm, and P3am determined using equivalent current dipoles. There were no group differences in EEG amplitude measures. In conclusion, our results suggest delayed pre-attentive auditory processing of novel information in opioid dependence. Benzodiazepine co-dependence modulated N1m response.", 
    "14": "1. During the characterization of recombinant CYP2C19, it was observed that this enzyme metabolized midazolam, which is generally regarded as CYP3A4/5 substrate, and we therefore decided to pursue this observation further. 2. CYP2C19 showed a Michaelis-Menten pattern for midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and was inhibited by (+)-N-3-benzylnirvanol and S-mephenytoin, which are a standard potent inhibitor and a substrate of CYP2C19, respectively. 3. The inhibitory potency by CYP3A4/5 inhibitor on the midazolam 1'-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes (HLM) was correlated with the CYP3A4/5 specific catalytic activity, but such correlation was not observed in CYP2C19 enzyme. The in vitro intrinsic clearance value for midazolam 1'-hydroxylation was not changed by the addition of (+)-N-3-benzylnirvanol in four individual HLM preparations. 4. These results indicated that although CYP2C19 is capable of catalyzing midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, CYP3A4/5 play a more important role.", 
    "15": "In 42 alcoholic inpatients we performed an open randomized study to compare the effects of diazepam and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) on the suppression of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome and hypercortisolism. Both diazepam (.5 mg/kg bodyweight, q.i.d.) and GHB (50 mg/kg bodyweight, q.i.d.) were orally administered for three weeks. During all study period, GHB was more able than diazepam in reducing both withdrawal syndrome and hypercortisolism. These effects were evident during the first week of treatment and persisted throughout the study period. The results confirm a strict correlation between high levels of plasma cortisol and alcohol withdrawal symptoms and they show a slight superiority of GHB over diazepam in the suppression of both ethanol withdrawal and hypercortisolism. Taken together, our data suggest that GHB may act as potent anti-withdrawal agent in severe abstinent alcoholics.", 
    "16": "This case study examines the benefits and effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and a female-specific unit for a woman with Bipolar Disorder. For this case study, the patient, Sonia, is a pseudonym for reasons of confidentiality. Sonia has been persistently non-compliant with her psychotropic medications since being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Throughout her life, she has maintained the distortion that she does not need her prescribed psychotropic medications. This thinking has served as a catalyst for Sonia to stop taking her prescribed psychotropic medications and ultimately relapse, which has resulted in approximately 20 psychiatric hospitalizations. Another intervention, in addition to psychotropic medications, was desperately needed to stop this vicious cycle, in order to address her negative conceptualization of her illness. During her last hospitalization on a specialized psychiatric inpatient program for women, Sonia received Cognitive Behavioral Therapy from a therapist in training at the Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy. The combination of CBT, re-stabilization on psychotropic medications, and a female-specific unit led to an excellent outcome for Sonia.", 
    "17": "Using an elevated plus-maze test, we evaluated anxiety level in rats given ovary lipid extracted from Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis; OLS). The percentage of open time was significantly higher in rats given OLS than in rats in the control group, but lower than in rats given diazepam (1.0 mg/kg body weight). Based on this fact and findings about other indicators, this study showed that OLS does not have as fast-acting and strong an anti-anxiety effect as diazepam but that continuous ingestion of OLS causes an anti-anxiety effect in animals.",

She was diagnosed as having SPD based on bizarre behavior, ideation and a tendency to seek isolation. She was treated with low-dose antipsychotics, and her impulsive behavior improved. The patient's SPD was considered to have had a psychopathological contribution to her chronic episodes of anorexia nervosa.", 
    "23": "Propofol formulated in a mixed medium-chain and long-chain triglycerides emulsion has been recently introduced for clinical use as an alternative to the conventional long-chain triglycerides formulation. This prospective multicentric study evaluated the clinical effectiveness and the complications associated with the use of this new formulation of propofol in dogs. Forty-six Spanish veterinary clinics participated in this study. A total of 541 anaesthesias (118 ASA I, 290 ASA II, 101 ASA III and 32 ASA IV) performed for various diagnostic and therapeutic purposes were evaluated. The anaesthetic protocol was not controlled, with the exception that propofol had to be used at least for induction of anaesthesia. The induction dose of propofol and the incidence of anaesthetic complications throughout the procedure were recorded. A chi-square test compared the incidence of complications according to the maintenance agent used (propofol vs. inhalatory anaesthesia), anaesthetic risk (ASA classification) and the reason for the anaesthesia. The patients premedicated with alpha2 agonists needed lower doses (mean +/- SD, 2.9 +/- 1.3 mg/kg i.v.) than the animals premedicated with phenothiazines (3.9 +/- 1.4 mg/kg i.v.) or benzodiazepines (4.0 +/- 1.4 mg/kg i.v.). The most frequent complications were difficult endotracheal intubation (1.3%), postinduction apnoea (11.3%), cyanosis (0.6%), bradypnoea (2.6%), tachypnoea (2.8%), bradycardia (2%), tachycardia (2.6%), hypotension (0.2%), shock (0.2%), vomiting (4.6%), epileptiform seizures (2.8%), premature awakening (7.4%) and delayed recovery (0.9%). There were no cases of pain on injection or aspiration pneumonia. Three dogs died (0.55%), one during induction and two during recovery from anaesthesia. This study demonstrates that the new formulation of propofol is an useful and effective drug to induce general anaesthesia in dogs.", 
    "24": "Pregabalin is the first anxiolytic pharmacologic alternative for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to be introduced in more than 10 years. GAD is a significant psychiatric condition with lifetime prevalence rates ranging between 5.7 and 6.4%. It causes significant impairment in quality of life and functional abilities equivalent to those associated with major depression. Randomized, controlled trials confirm that pregabalin is superior to placebo and comparable with lorazepam, alprazolam and venlafaxine for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe GAD. The onset of anxiolytic activity for pregabalin is apparent within 1 week following initiation of treatment, which is more rapid than that obtained with paroxetine and venlafaxine. Additionally, pregabalin has demonstrated potential for the prevention of relapse of GAD. Recently, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of pregabalin were also shown in a placebo-controlled study with elderly patients. Safety and tolerability profiles are favorable, with transient dizziness and somnolence of mild-to-moderate severity being the most commonly reported adverse events. Pregabalin has minimal potential for drug-drug interactions and does not provoke a clinically significant withdrawal response. Furthermore, pregabalin has low potential for abuse and dependence, unlike other classes of medications used for the treatment of GAD. Clinicians may consider the use of pregabalin in lieu of benzodiazepines as an alternative therapy for their patients with GAD.",

    "30": "Local anaesthetics, opioids and adjuvants are often used for managing labor pain. Some others of these agents are reported to cause alterations on uterine contractility during labor. However, there are controversies and the effects of some others are unknown. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of opioids such as alfentanyl, meperidine, remifentanyl; local anesthetics such as mepivacaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine; and adjuvants such as clonidine and midazolam on isolated pregnant rat uterine muscle. Strips of longitudinal uterine smooth muscle obtained from rats pregnant for 18-21 days were suspended in 20 ml organ baths. Isometric tension was continuously measured with an isometric force transducer connected to a computer-based data acquisition system. The effects of cumulative concentrations of alfentanyl, meperidine, remifentanyl, mepivacaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, clonidine and midazolam (10(-8) - 10(-4) M, for all) on contractions induced by oxytocin (1 mU/ml) were studied. Alfentanyl (10(-5) M), meperidine (10(-5) M), remifentanyl (10(-4) M), bupivacaine (10(-4) M), ropivacaine (10(-4) M) and midazolam (3 x 10(-5) M) caused significant decreases in contractile responses of uterine strips to oxytocin. Contrastingly, mepivacaine increased (33.1% +/- 7.2%) oxytocin-induced contractions of uterine strips while clonidine exerted no significant effect. The sensitivity of myometrial preparations to tested local anesthetics or opioids did not differ significantly. The findings of the present study demonstrated that some local anesthetics, opioids and adjuvants caused significant and agent-specific alterations on contractility of the pregnant rat myometrium. Therefore, they seemed to have a potential to influence uterine contractility during clinical management of pain during labor. However, further research is needed to extrapolate these finding to clinical practice.",

The stereochemical correlation of the two C(6) aromatic groups with respect to the benzodiazepine ring system is pseudo-equatorial-equatorial for compounds (I) (the phenyl group), (II) (the 2,3-dimethoxyphenyl group) and (III) (the 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group), while for (IV) (the 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl group) the system is pseudo-axial-equatorial. An intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl OH group and a benzodiazepine N atom is present for all four compounds and defines a six-membered ring, whose geometry is constant across the series. Although the molecular structures are similar, the supramolecular packing is different; compounds (I) and (IV) form chains, while (II) forms dimeric units and (III) displays a layered structure. The packing seems to depend on at least two factors: (i) the nature of the atoms defining the hydrogen bond and (ii) the number of intermolecular interactions of the types O-H...O, N-H...O, N-H...pi(arene) or C-H...pi(arene).", 
    "32": "The spectral edge frequency (SEF) 95 is one of the electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters, which is a relatively simple and effective method to evaluate a sedative status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on electroencephalographic SEF 95 in dogs (4.2 - 6.1 kg, 1-2 years old) sedated by a sedative. The acupoints used were the GV20 point and Yintang point. The sedatives used were acepromazine, butorphanol, diazepam, medetomidine, and phenobarbital, each using a different mechanism. The sedation level was assessed by a SEF 95 value under normal conditions, sedation being induced by a sedative, a combination of a sedative and acupuncture, and acupuncture release. During the sedative and acupuncture combination, the SEF 95 values significantly decreased in the butorphanol group. Although this result was just based on the changes of the brain it is suggested that acupuncture, combined with opioids, would be a useful method to produce a safe and deep sedation in clinics.", 
    "33": "This article reviews the safety and efficacy of enteral sedation use by dentists to provide an evidence-based perspective on the current controversy associated with the use and training requirements for enteral sedation in dental outpatients. Despite the many benefits to patients and dental practitioners, the administration of anxiolytic agents by the oral, sublingual, or rectal route (collectively referred to as enteral sedation) is controversial and has engendered efforts to limit its use and increase training requirements to levels similar to those for parenteral sedation. Factors contributing to this controversy include the off-label use of sedative-hypnotics for outpatient sedation, idiosyncratic reactions to triazolam, and incremental dosing. Evidence supports the continued need and demand for anesthesia and sedation services to ensure access to care for highly anxious and phobic patients, the very young, and special-needs patients. The published evidence and vast clinical experience for oral sedation with benzodiazepines also supports the safety of administering benzodiazepines for anxiety relief with little evidence of deleterious effects when administered incrementally to patients undergoing a dental procedure or at doses greater than those used for hypnosis. Enteral sedation with benzodiazepines remains a time-tested, safe, and widely used modality that needs to be maintained as part of general practice to ensure adequate access to dental care for the many patients for whom fear of dentistry remains a significant barrier to oral health care.",

Because gamma-aminobutyric acid is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and because benzodiazepines facilitate this effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid, decreased benzodiazepine binding is consistent with localized brain activation (ie, loss of inhibition). Because the insula is strongly involved in visceral-somatic afferent and efferent function, activation of the insula is consistent with the occurrence of the physical symptoms prominently associated with panic disorder.",

Recently one benzodiazepine (triazolam) has been found to disproportionately impair memory for emotionally arousing material (Buchanan et al., 2003). The extent to which this effect may be mediated by the drug's sedative action is unclear. The present study aimed to assess how pharmacologically decreasing physiological arousal with a benzodiazepine and increasing arousal with a stimulant impact on memory for emotional material. A double-blind placebo controlled trial with 48 volunteers was used to investigate the effects of methylphenidate (40 mg) and Lorazepam (1.5 mg) on incidental memory for emotional material in Cahill and McGaugh's (1995) slide-story task. The slide-story was presented to participants administered either active drug or placebo and retrieval was assessed one week later. Methylphenidate produced stimulant effects and Lorazepam produced sedative effects. Significantly enhanced memory for emotional material was observed in participants given placebo, but not in those given either methylphenidate or Lorazepam. Despite producing opposite effects upon arousal, both methylphenidate and Lorazepam lessen the impact of emotionally arousing material on memory. The effects of Lorazepam add to a growing literature that benzodiazepines may exert their clinical, anxiolytic effects in part via altering emotionaL cognitive function.",

Electronic spin resonance spectroscopy studies were carried out, at 25 degrees C and at an ionic strength of 0.10 M in NaCl, using 5-, 12- and 16-doxylstearic acid probes (AS). The immobilization degree of solubilized stearic acid spin probes was found to vary with the position of the nitroxide group in the sequence 5-doxylstearic acid>12-doxylstearic acid>16-doxylstearic acid for SDS and 12-doxylstearic acid>5-doxylstearic acid>16-doxylstearic acid for both bile salts investigated. Therefore, from the rotational correlational time values obtained, it can be inferred that the structure of bile salt micelles is markedly different from that of SDS micelles and the results suggest that the bile salt micelles studied have similar structure independently of differences in the molecular structure of the respective bile salts. Drug location studies were performed at pH 4.0 (SDS solutions) or 7.0 (bile salt solutions) and 10.8 in order to study the effect of the drug ionisation on its relative position on micelles. The results have shown that drug location is controlled by the (i) drug hydrophilicity and acid/base properties, with the more soluble compound in water (atenolol) exhibiting smaller variation of rotational correlational time (in SDS and bile salts solutions), and with both beta-blockers exhibiting smaller deviations in the protonated forms and (ii) the bile salt monomers, with the dihydroxylic bile salt (deoxycholate) producing larger differences. The work described herein allow us to conclude that the (protonated) beta-blockers are probably located on the surface of the detergent micelles, and linked to them by means of essentially electrostatic forces, while the (neutral) benzodiazepines are probably located deeper in the interior of the micelles.",

The purpose of this study is to verify the hypothesis that this transient acute postprandial hyperlipidemia affects the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic drugs on both absorption and disposition levels by the same underlying mechanism, namely the association of active lipophilic compounds with TRL in the plasma (disposition) or within the enterocyte (lymphatic transport). This concept was assessed in rats using two model compounds, DDT with high affinity to chylomicrons and diazepam which does not bind to chylomicrons. Oral administration of peanut oil significantly increased the AUC of plasma DDT concentrations following its IV bolus administration in comparison to a water treated group. On the other hand, the AUC of diazepam following IV bolus administration was the same in oil and water treated rats. While DDT is known to have significant lymphatic bioavailability, diazepam has negligible intestinal lymphatic transport (0.014+/-0.004% of a given dose). In conclusion, lipophilic molecules that bind extensively to TRL will be prone to both intestinal lymphatic transport and to post-absorptive changes in disposition (decrease in clearance and volume of distribution) following a high-fat meal.",

On the basis of a Bayesian probabilistic approach, the method is widely used in the field of machine learning but has rarely been applied in quantitative structure-activity relationship and ADME modeling. The method is suitable for modeling nonlinear relationships, does not require subjective determination of the model parameters, works for a large number of descriptors, and is inherently resistant to overtraining. The performance of Gaussian Processes compares well with and often exceeds that of artificial neural networks. Due to these features, the Gaussian Processes technique is eminently suitable for automatic model generation-one of the demands of modern drug discovery. Here, we describe the basic concept of the method in the context of regression problems and illustrate its application to the modeling of several ADME properties: blood-brain barrier, hERG inhibition, and aqueous solubility at pH 7.4. We also compare Gaussian Processes with other modeling techniques.", 
    "87": "In this study, we investigated whether morphine dependence was inhibited by phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors rolipram and diazepam, since a role for the cyclic AMP systems in the development of morphine dependence was reported. Dependence of morphine was induced by a 7-day s.c. implantation of morphine pellets. Morphine withdrawal was precipitated on day 8 by an injection of naloxone. In order to determine the effect of rolipram or diazepam the animals were injected with these drugs for seven days and 30 min before the administration of naloxone. When opioid withdrawal was precipitated, enhancement of noradrenaline (NA) turnover in the heart was observed 30 min after naloxone administration. Moreover, morphine withdrawal induces Fos expression, increase in cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels. Co-administration of rolipram or diazepam with morphine during the pre-treatment period significantly reduces the signs of withdrawal symptoms, the enhancement of NA turnover, the increase in cyclic AMP and the Fos expression. However, these inhibitors did not modify the levels of cyclic GMP. These findings demonstrated that co-administration of rolipram or diazepam with morphine abolish the development of morphine dependence and suggest that these compounds prevent the up-regulation of the cyclic AMP pathway and the associated increase in cyclic AMP level after naloxone administration.",

    "90": "In the diseased brain, upon activation microglia express binding sites for synthetic ligands designed to recognize the 18-kDa translocator protein TP-18, which is part of the so-called peripheral benzodiazepine receptor complex. PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide], the prototype synthetic ligand, has been widely used for the functional characterization of TP-18. Its cellular source in activated microglia has been established using high-resolution, single-cell autoradiography with the R-enantiomer [3H](R)-PK11195. Radiolabeled [11C](R)-PK11195 has been used to image active brain disease with positron emission tomography. Consistent with experimental and postmortem observations of a characteristically distributed pattern of microglia activation in areas of focal pathology, as well as in anterograde and retrograde projection areas, the in vivo regional [11C](R)-PK11195 signal is found in active focal lesions and over time also along the affected neural tracts and their respective cortical and subcortical projection areas. Thus, a profile of active disease emerges that matches some of the typical distribution patterns known from structural neuroimaging techniques, but additionally shows involvement of brain regions linked through neural pathways. In the context of cell-based in vivo neuropathology, the image data are thus best interpreted in the context of the emerging cellular understanding of brain disease or damage, rather than the definitions of clinical diagnosis. One important observation, borne out by experiment, is the long latency with which activated microglia or increased PK11195 retention appear to gradually emerge and remain in distal areas secondarily affected by disease, supporting speculations that the presence of activated microglia is an important corollary of brain plasticity.",

However, pathophysiological or biochemical mechanisms underlying the alterations of pain perception in patients suffering from anxiety or depression still remain a matter of debate. Thus, we aimed to perform an investigation on pain perception in an animal model of extremes in anxiety-related behaviour, which might provide a tool for future studies. Here, thermal pain thresholds were obtained from rats with a genetic predisposition to high anxiety-related behaviour (HAB), including signs of comorbid depression-like behaviour and from controls (low-anxiety rats (LAB); cross-bred HAB and LAB rats; Wistar rats). Furthermore, the effect of eight-week antidepressive treatment using citalopram and of short-term anxiolytic treatment with diazepam on pain-related behaviour was assessed. Simultaneously, anxiety-related behaviour was monitored. At baseline, HAB animals showed 35% higher thresholds for thermal pain than controls. These were normalized to control levels after eight weeks of continuous citalopram treatment paralleled by a reduction of anxiety-related behaviour, but also acutely after diazepam administration. Overall, thermal pain thresholds in HAB animals are shifted in a similar fashion as seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Antidepressive, as well as anxiolytic treatments, attenuated these differences. As the relative importance of the factors anxiety and depression cannot be derived from this study with certainty, extending these investigations to additional animal models might represent a valuable tool for future investigations concerning the interrelations between anxiety, depression, and pain at a molecular level.",

The study population was composed of 35 patients with moderate-stage AD. Patients who were taking antipsychotics scored significantly worse on a recent autobiographical memory measure compared with patients who were not taking antipsychotics.

To monitor pancreatic and gallbladder effects, patients underwent abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatment. We randomized 701 patients to double-blind treatment. GI181771X did not reduce body weight and had no effect on waist circumference or other cardiometabolic risk markers. Gastrointestinal side effects were more common with GI181771X than with placebo treatment, whereas hepatobiliary or pancreatic abnormalities did not occur.

After adjustment for age and sex, number of dispensed drugs was strongly associated with all 4 measures of IDU. After adjustment for sex and number of dispensed drugs, increasing age was moderately associated with a higher probability of IDU, long-acting benzodiazepines, and 3 or more psychotropic drugs, After adjustment for age and number of dispensed drugs, women had a slightly increased probability of IDU, anticholinergic drugs, long-acting benzodiazepines, and 3 or more psychotropic drugs.",

The challenge is to balance the problems related to IDU without denying older people potentially valuable drug therapy.", 
    "105": "The present study assessed whether benzodiazepines impair the acquisition, performance, and reversal of olfactory and auditory go/no-go discriminations in rats. Experiment 1 showed that midazolam (0.5-2 mg/kg sc) did not affect the performance of a well-learned two-odor olfactory discrimination and moderately facilitated performance of a go/no-go auditory discrimination. Experiment 2 found that midazolam (1 mg/kg) increased the number of errors made in the acquisition of a novel go/no-go olfactory discrimination task and in the reversal of a previously well-learned olfactory discrimination. However, midazolam did not affect the acquisition and reversal of an equivalent auditory discrimination task. Experiment 3 showed that diazepam (1 mg/kg) also impaired the acquisition and reversal of a novel olfactory discrimination task. Taken together, these results indicate that benzodiazepines cause a selective impairment of olfactory discrimination learning. This may reflect an effect of benzodiazepines in the glomerular circuitry of the olfactory bulb and at downstream olfactory processing sites such as the piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex.",

After sampling, the extracted drugs were subsequently quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. External calibrations in whole blood and phosphate-buffered saline were used to correlate the amount of analytes extracted in regard to the total and free concentrations in blood respectively. The probe provided sufficient sensitivity for the drugs in the blood matrix, while the need for drawing blood was eliminated. The limit of detections of the method from whole blood were 1.7, 1.4 and 2.8 ng mL(-1) for the analysis of diazepam, nordiazepam and oxazepam respectively, and the linear range was from 4 ng mL(-1) to 2 microg mL(-1). The method was applied for the monitoring of pharmacokinetic profiles of intravenous administration of diazepam and its two main metabolites in dogs, and the results were compared with profiles determined by conventional methods. This approach offered increased sensitivity and accuracy, short extraction time, and convenient calibration for in vivo sampling for dynamic monitoring.",

However, the long term use of the drugs can lead to serious adverse health effects such as psychomotor and cognitive impairment, especially in the elderly. In Japan, there are very few reports concerning long-term use of benzodiazepines, and no countermeasures have been instituted. Thus, this study assessed the characteristics of long-term prescription of benzodiazepines at a university hospital in Japan. A cross-sectional study using the database of a computer ordering system examined 4,239 adult outpatients who were prescribed benzodiazepines at a university teaching hospital between July 2002 and June 2003. The patients were divided into two groups: those with long-term (> or = 3 months) and short-term (< or = 2 months) prescriptions. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the effect of patient age on long-term benzodiazepine prescription. Adjusting for patient gender, pharmacological half-life of the drug, and department group, a logistic regression model showed that long-term benzodiazepine prescription occurred more frequently in older patients (p < 0.0001 in trend tests) and varied according to the physician's specialty (p < 0.0001). Benzodiazepines were more frequently prescribed for long term in the elderly by internal medicine group (p = 0.003). Of the patients older than 71 years (n = 1,105), 86% were assigned to the long-term group and were more likely to have been prescribed benzodiazepines by an internist than a surgeon (p < 0.0001). The appropriate prescription of benzodiazepines in the elderly should be included in the educational programs at teaching hospitals, and rational prescribing needs to be monitored carefully.",

They have a place in early human clinical psychopharmacology as well, in order to get early clues that contribute to establish the proof of concept (POC) already in healthy volunteers (HV). Different types of models are available (pharmacological or non-pharmacological provocation, models based on age-related characteristics). This review is focused on pharmacological models in HV, with the aim to identify the main issues raised by their use in pharmaceutical trials. The available models unevenly fulfil the requirements of face validity, sufficient response rate, test-retest consistence and responsiveness to reference drugs. Most of them have been developed in the purpose of pathophysiology studies, using rating instruments validated for clinical practice. Substantial progress could be made by adapting models to the specific requirements of pharmaceutical trials, including wider use of biomarkers. Characteristics that make models, as well as biomarkers, suitabLe for use in drug development are proposed. Despite obvious limitations, human models can significantly enhance the way phase I studies contribute to establish the POC, provided they are integrated into adapted phase I development plans. Their use as industrial tools for drug evaluation requires specific, dedicated development.",

PBRs play a role in antioxidant pathways and apoptosis, key factors in control of lung health. Intrapulmonary PBRs, assessed in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET), are decreased in interstitial lung disease (ILD) despite increased macrophage numbers. We wished to ascertain whether the observed decrease in in vivo expression of PBRs in the PET scans could be accounted for by a reduction in PBRs per cell by saturation-binding assays of R-PK11195 in cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).",

    "117": "This review discusses evidence for and apparent controversy about, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor (GABAAR) subtypes that mediate alcohol effects experienced during social drinking. GABAARs that contain the beta3 and delta subunits were shown to be enhanced by alcohol concentrations that mirror the concentration dependence of alcohol responses in humans. A mutation (alpha6R100Q) previously found in alcohol nontolerant rats in the cerebellar GABAAR alpha6 subunit is sufficient for increased alcohol-induced ataxia in rats homozygous for this mutation (alpha6-100QQ) and further increases alcohol sensitivity of tonic GABA currents (mediated by alpha6betadelta receptors) in cerebellar granule cells of alpha6-100QQ rats and in recombinant alpha6R100Qbeta3delta receptors. This provided the first direct evidence that these types of receptors mediate behavioral effects of ethanol. Furthermore, the behavioral alcohol antagonist Ro15-4513 specifically reverses ethanol enhancement on alpha4/6beta3delta receptors. Unexpectedly, native and recombinant alpha4/6beta3delta receptors bind the behavioral alcohol antagonist Ro15-4513 with high affinity and this binding is competitive with EtOH, suggesting a specific and mutually exclusive (competitive) ethanol/Ro15-4513 site, which explains the puzzling activity of Ro15-4513 as a behavioral alcohol antagonist. Our conclusion from these findings is that alcohol/Ro15-4513-sensitive GABAAR subtypes are important alcohol targets and that alcohol at relevant concentrations is more specific than previously thought. In this review, we discuss technical difficulties in expressing recombinant delta subunit-containing receptors in oocytes and mammalian cells that may have contributed to negative results and confusion. Not only because we have reproduced detailed positive results numerous times, and we and many others have built extensively on basic findings, but also because we explain and combine many previously puzzling results into a coherent and highly plausible paradigm on how alcohol exerts an important part of its action in the brain, we are confident about our findings and conclusions. However, many important open questions remain to be answered.", 
    "118": "In rodent models, gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors with the alpha6 and delta subunits, expressed in the cerebellar and cochlear nucleus granule cells, have been linked to ethanol sensitivity and voluntary ethanol drinking. Here, we review the findings. When considering both in vivo contributions and data on cloned receptors, the evidence for direct participation of the alpha6-containing receptors to increased ethanol sensitivity is poor. The alpha6 subunit-knockout mouse lines do not have any changed sensitivity to ethanol, although these mice do display increased benzodiazepine sensitivity. However, in general the compensations occurring in knockout mice (regardless of which particular gene is knocked out) tend to fog interpretations of drug actions at the systems level. For example, the alpha6 knockout mice have increased TASK-1 channel expression in their cerebellar granule cells, which could influence sensitivity to ethanol in the opposite direction to that obtained with the alpha6 knockouts. Indeed, TASK-1 knockout mice are more impaired than wild types in motor skills when given ethanol; this might explain why GABAA receptor alpha6 knockout mice have unchanged ethanol sensitivities. As an alternative to studying knockout mice, we examined the claimed delta subunit-dependent/gamma2 subunit-independent ethanol/[3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites on GABAA receptors. We looked at [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in HEK 293 cell membrane homogenates containing rat recombinant alpha6/4beta3delta receptors and in mouse brain sections. Specific high-affinity [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding could not be detected under any conditions to the recombinant receptors or to the cerebellar sections of gamma2(F77I) knockin mice, nor was this binding to brain sections of wild-type C57BL/6 inhibited by 1-100 mM ethanol. Since ethanol may act on many receptor and channel protein targets in neuronal membranes, we consider the alpha6 (and alpha4) subunit-containing GABAA receptors unlikely to be directly responsible for any major part of ethanol's actions. Therefore, we finish the review by discussing more generally alcohol and GABAA receptors and by suggesting potential future directions for this research.", 
    "119": "Bispectral index (BIS) is used for monitoring anaesthetic depth with inhaled anaesthetic agents in the operating room but has not been evaluated as a monitor of sedation depth in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting with these agents. If BIS could predict sedation depth in ICU patients, patient disturbances could be reduced and oversedation avoided. Twenty ventilator-dependent ICU patients aged 27 to 80 years were randomised to sedation with isoflurane via the AnaConDa or intravenous midazolam. BIS (A-2000 XP, version 3.12), electromyogram activity (EMG) and Signal Quality Index were measured continuously. Hourly clinical evaluation of sedation depth according to Bloomsbury Sedation Score (Bloomsbury) was performed. The median BIS value during a 10-minute interval prior to the clinical evaluation at the bedside was compared with Bloomsbury. Nurses performing the clinical sedation scoring were blinded to the BIS values. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was measured and compared with Bloomsbury. Correlation was poor between BIS and Bloomsbury in both groups (Spearman's rho 0.012 in the isoflurane group and -0.057 in the midazolam group). Strong correlation was found between BIS and EMG (Spearman's rho 0.74). Significant correlation was found between end-tidal isoflurane concentration and Bloomsbury (Spearman's rho 0.47). In conclusion, BIS XP does not reliably predict sedation depth as measured by clinical evaluation in non-paralysed ICU patients sedated with isoflurane or midazolam. EMG contributes significantly to BIS values in isoflurane or midazolam sedated, non-paralysed ICU patients. End-tidal isoflurane concentration appeared to be a better indicator of clinical sedation depth than BIS.",

They are potent 5-HT3 blockers, but it is often not appreciated that mirtazapine and olanzapine bind with similar affinity to 5-HT3 receptors, have a longer half-life, are considerably cheaper than the 'setron class, and often offer better and smoother 24-h nausea control than 'setron class drugs. Mirtazapine and olanzapine often have salutary antianxiety effects and improve sleep quality. They occasionally relieve chemotherapy-related and advanced cancer-related nausea and appetite decrease better than the 'setron group that are specifically marketed for nausea control. Mirtazapine and olanzapine frequently give potent nausea reduction and appetite increase in advanced cancer-related cachexia. Several cytokine changes potentially induced by mirtazapine and olanzapine use are discussed that may have salutary effects in several cancers. We suggest mirtazapine and olanzapine be included as first-line options in treating both chemotherapy- and advanced cancer-related nausea. Multiple clinical and economic advantages of mirtazapine and olanzapine over currently used 'setron class medicines are reviewed. Double-blind studies against the 'setron class drugs are warranted.", 
    "149": "The established protocol for DNase I footprinting has been modified to allow multiple parallel reactions to be rapidly performed in 96-well microtitre plates. By scrutinizing every aspect of the traditional method and making appropriate modifications it has been possible to considerably reduce the time, risk of sample loss and complexity of footprinting, whilst dramatically increasing the yield of data (30-fold). A semi-automated analysis system has also been developed to present footprinting data as an estimate of the binding affinity of each tested compound to any base pair in the assessed DNA sequence, giving an intuitive 'one compound-one line' scheme. Here, we demonstrate the screening capabilities of the 96-well assay and the subsequent data analysis using a series of six pyrrolobenzodiazepine-polypyrrole compounds and human Topoisomerase II alpha promoter DNA. The dramatic increase in throughput, quantified data and decreased handling time allow, for the first time, DNase I footprinting to be used as a screening tool to assess DNA-binding agents.", 
    "150": "Valerian is a commonly used herbal medicinal product for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. Here we report the stimulation of chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors (I(GABA)) by valerenic acid (VA), a constituent of Valerian. To analyse the molecular basis of VA action, we expressed GABA(A) receptors with 13 different subunit compositions in Xenopus oocytes and measured I(GABA) using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. We report a subtype-dependent stimulation of I(GABA) by VA. Only channels incorporating beta(2) or beta(3) subunits were stimulated by VA. Replacing beta(2/3) by beta(1) drastically reduced the sensitivity of the resulting GABA(A) channels. The stimulatory effect of VA on alpha(1)beta(2) receptors was substantially reduced by the point mutation beta(2N265S) (known to inhibit loreclezole action). Mutating the corresponding residue of beta(1) (beta(1S290N)) induced VA sensitivity in alpha(1)beta(1S290N) comparable to alpha(1)beta(2) receptors. Modulation of I(GABA) was not significantly dependent on incorporation of alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3) or alpha(5) subunits. VA displayed a significantly lower efficiency on channels incorporating alpha(4) subunits. I(GABA) modulation by VA was not gamma subunit dependent and not inhibited by flumazenil (1 microM). VA shifted the GABA concentration-effect curve towards lower GABA concentrations and elicited substantial currents through GABA(A) channels at > or = 30 microM. At higher concentrations (> or = 100 microM), VA and acetoxy-VA inhibit I(GABA). A possible open channel block mechanism is discussed. In summary, VA was identified as a subunit specific allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors that is likely to interact with the loreclezole binding pocket.", 
    "151": "Levetiracetam (LEV) is a structurally novel antiepileptic drug (AED) which has demonstrated a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activities both in experimental and clinical studies. Previous experiments in the kindling model suggested that LEV, in addition to its seizure-suppressing activity, may possess antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying activity. In the present study, we evaluated this possibility by using a rat model in which epilepsy with spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), behavioral alterations, and hippocampal damages develop after a status epilepticus (SE) induced by sustained electrical stimulation of the basal amygdala. Two experimental protocols were used. In the first protocol, LEV treatment was started 24h after onset of electrical amygdala stimulation without prior termination of the SE. In the second protocol, the SE was interrupted after 4h by diazepam, immediately followed by onset of treatment with LEV. Treatment with LEV was continued for 8 weeks (experiment #1) or 5 weeks (experiment #2) after SE, using continuous drug administration via osmotic minipumps. The occurrence of SRS was recorded during and after treatment. In addition, the rats were tested in a battery of behavioral tests, including the elevated-plus maze and the Morris water maze. Finally, the brains of the animals were analyzed for histological lesions in the hippocampal formation. With the experimental protocols chosen for these experiments, LEV did not exert antiepileptogenic or neuroprotective activity. Furthermore, the behavioral alterations, e.g., behavioral hyperexcitability and learning deficits, in epileptic rats were not affected by treatment with LEV after SE. These data do not support the idea that administration of LEV after SE prevents or reduces the long-term alterations developing after such brain insult in rats.",

Benzodiazepines are the most widely used drugs for the sleep related problems in spite of their limitations and side effects. Objective of the study was to investigate the protective effect of W. somnifera on the behavioral and biochemical alterations in sleep disturbed mice. Pretreatment with W. somnifera root extract (100. 200 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) significantly protected reduction in body weight, improved the reduced locomotor activity and anxiety levels in animals. Biochemical studies also revealed that W. somnifera (100 and 200 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) pretreatment for five days decreased significantly lipid peroxidation, nitrites levels and improved catalase, and reduced glutathione levels. Co-administration of W. somnifera (100 mg/kg) with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) improved significantly all the biochemical parameters as compared to their effect per se. Preliminary results suggest that Withania root extract can be used in the management sleep loss and associated oxidative stress.", 
    "153": "The purpose of the present study was to explore the applicability of the reciprocal permeability approach to correct for changes in thermodynamic activity when in vitro permeability data are generated in the presence of plasma proteins. Diazepam (DIA), digoxin (DIG), and propranolol (PRO) permeability was assessed in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bovine alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). The reciprocal permeability approach was subsequently employed to calculate the true permeability coefficient (Papp(corr)) and the operational protein association constant (nK(a)). For BSA binding, good agreement was observed between the Papp(corr) values and Papp values obtained in the absence of protein. For PRO and AAG, where binding affinity was high, deviation in the reciprocal permeability plots was evident suggesting ligand depletion at low drug/high protein concentrations. Bidirectional DIG permeability data in the presence of either BSA or AAG indicated that neither protein had an effect on the efflux transporters involved in DIG permeability. The data suggest that plasma proteins can be utilized in permeability experiments with no adverse effects on transporter function and that the reciprocal permeability approach can be used to correct permeability data for changes in unbound drug concentration.",

CNS 7056, like midazolam and other classic benzodiazepines, did not show clear selectivity between subtypes of the GABAA receptor. CNS 7056 (intravenous) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of substantia nigra pars reticulata neuronal firing and recovery to baseline firing rates was reached rapidly. CNS 7056 (intravenous) induced loss of the righting reflex in rodents. The duration of loss of righting reflex was short (< 10 min) and was inhibited by pretreatment with flumazenil.",

Inhibition of substantia nigra pars reticulata firing and the inhibition of the effects of CNS 7056 by flumazenil show that it acts at the brain benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "158": "The aim of the present study was to estimate the time course change in cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity during repeated doses of erythromycin. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in this randomized, 4 x 4 Latin square design study. The pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of midazolam, a probe for CYP3A activity, were assessed in 4 conditions: (1) midazolam (5 mg) without erythromycin (EM0), (2) erythromycin 2 days + midazolam (2.5 mg) (EM2), (3) erythromycin 4 days + midazolam (2.5 mg) (EM4), and (4) erythromycin 7 days + midazolam (2.5 mg) (EM7). The dose of erythromycin was 800 mg/d. Erythromycin produced a 2.3-, 3.4-, and 3.4-fold increase in dose-corrected area under the curve of midazolam for EM2, EM4, and EM7, respectively, as compared with EM0 (P <.05/6). A significant prolongation of terminal half-life was observed in EM4 and EM7. The relationship between the duration of erythromycin treatment and total clearance of midazolam indicated that a plateau level of CYP3A inhibition can be achieved by 4 days or more of erythromycin treatment. The repeated treatment with erythromycin yields CYP3A inhibition in a duration-dependent manner. A 4-day course of erythromycin treatment produces 90% or more of the maximal inhibition of CYP3A in humans.", 
    "159": "The repetitive activation of synaptic glutamate receptors can induce a lasting change in the number or subunit composition of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs). However, NMDA receptors that are present extrasynaptically can also be activated by a burst of presynaptic activity, and thus may be involved in the induction of synaptic plasticity. Here we show that the physiological-like activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs induces a lasting change in the synaptic current, by changing the subunit composition of AMPARs at the parallel fibre-to-cerebellar stellate cell synapse. This extrasynaptic NMDAR-induced switch in synaptic AMPARs from GluR2-lacking (Ca(2+)-permeable) to GluR2-containing (Ca(2+)-impermeable) receptors requires the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). These results indicate that the activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs by glutamate spillover is an important mechanism that detects the pattern of afferent activity and subsequently exerts a remote regulation of AMPAR subtypes at the synapse via a PKC-dependent pathway.",

In this study, the complete 32.5 kb gene cluster for the biosynthesis of anthramycin was identified by using a genome-scanning approach, and cluster boundaries were estimated via comparative genomics. A lambda-RED-mediated gene-replacement system was developed to provide supporting evidence for critical biosynthetic genes and to validate the boundaries of the proposed anthramycin gene cluster. Sequence analysis reveals that the 25 open reading frame anthramycin cluster contains genes consistent with the biosynthesis of the two halves of anthramycin: 4 methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and a \"dehydroproline acrylamide\" moiety. These nonproteinogenic amino acid precursors are condensed by a two-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) terminated by a reductase domain, consistent with the final hemiaminal oxidation state of anthramycin.",

These CCK1R ligands have been found following the two usual and complementary strategies for drug discovery: rational design based on structure activity relationships on the CCK-7 and CCK-4 peptide sequences of the endogenous ligands and random screening of diverse compounds, followed by hit optimization. The first group includes: chimeric bifunctional opioid/CCK peptides, designed as opioid agonists with balanced CCK1R/CCK2R antagonist activity for the treatment of neuropathic pain, antagonist and agonist dipeptoids, and 1,3-dioxoperhydropyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine- and anthranilic acid-based antagonists. Among the ligands derived from random screening, a few new 1,4-benzodiazepine-, 1,5-benzodiazepine-, and five member ring heterocycle-based CCK1R ligands have been reported.

    "162": "The Vogel conflict test has been widely used as a methodology for detecting anxiolytic-like effects of drugs with a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. Despite widespread acceptance of the Vogel assay as a preclinical predictor of efficacy for anxiolytic-like compounds, detailed parametrics have not been reported on the optimization of this assay to determine how the schedule of reinforcement, the rate of responding and the frequency and temporal distribution of punishing events determine drug effect. The current report documents results of a systematic study of the relationship between number of shocks delivered and efficacy of the prototypical 1,4-benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDAP) in rats. Under this procedure, water-deprived rats were given access to water and during the later part of this access period, contacts with the drinking tube produced a brief electric shock. CDAP (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) was first tested under a fixed-ratio 20 response schedule (every 20 th lick produced shock delivered via the sipper tube). CDAP produced dose-dependent increases in punished licking to approximately 275% of control at 20 mg/kg. Increasing the number of shocks during the first ten responses of the punishment component decreased the number of licks made under vehicle control conditions. The frequency of shock delivery produced both quantitative and qualitative changes in the effects of chlordiazepoxide ranging from no effect to 7000% increases in responding. The effects of chlordiazepoxide were dependent both on the control rate of responding and, independently, on the frequency of shock deliveries. Parametric variation under the Vogel conflict test may be useful in comparing the efficacy of novel approaches to the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

As the glutamatergic system may play an important role in pathophysiology of both depression and anxiety, we decided to discuss the recent data on possible anxiolytic and/or antidepressant effects of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor ligands. Preclinical data indicated that antagonists of group I mGlu receptors, particularly antagonists of mGlu5 receptors, produced both anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like effects. Clinical data also demonstrated that mGlu5 receptor antagonist, fenobam, was an active anxiolytic drug. The anxiolytic effects exerted by mGlu5 receptor antagonists are profound, comparable with or stronger than those of benzodiazepines. However, the problem with the psychotomimetic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists and their possible influence on memory has to be further investigated. Among all mGlu receptor ligands, group II mGlu receptor agonists seem to be the drugs with the most promising therapeutic potential and a good safety profile. Animal studies showed anxiolytic-like effects of group II mGlu receptor agonists. Currently, group II mGlu receptor agonists are in phase III clinical trials for potential treatment of anxiety disorders. On the other hand, data has been accumulated, indicating that antagonists of group II mGlu receptors have an antidepressant potential. Group III mGlu receptor ligands represent the least investigated group of mGlu receptors. However, preclinical data also indicates that ligands of these receptors, both agonists and antagonists, may have an anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like potential.",

Onset has a consistent predictable component (such as aura or prodrome, which may be a convulsive or nonconvulsive symptom, or characteristic single or multiple seizures) that is predictably and temporally linked to subsequent seizures. Typically there is recovery between seizures. Episodes may or may not progress to a prolonged seizure or to status epilepticus but may be predictable for each patient based on history. Acute repetitive seizures may include any type of epileptic seizure and may occur at any age. Other terms for acute repetitive seizures include cluster, serial, recurrent, or crescendo seizures. Treatment should only be administered by caregivers who in the opinion of the prescriber are capable of monitoring the clinical response and recognize when the response is such that immediate professional evaluation or care is necessary. Caregivers must be comfortable so that they feel capable of recognizing when and how to treat.

Stimulation of glycogen synthesis by alpha-methyl-5-HT correlated with depletion of phosphorylase a.

In contrast, VD images showed ipsilateral hippocampal decreases in all 15 patients, with bilateral decreases in three patients. Bilateral decreases in the ADD images tended to be more symmetrical and in one case were more marked contralaterally. Full quantification with an image-independent input should ideally be used in the evaluation of FMZ PET; at least in TLE, intrasubject correlations do not predict equivalent clinical usefulness."
