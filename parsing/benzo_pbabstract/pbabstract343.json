This system consisted of an artificial neural network operating on the basis of preprocessed EEG data and was composed to provide a maximum of robustness for online applications. In the present study the influence of acute administration of lorazepam on the performance of the REM detection procedure was evaluated. Following an adaptation to laboratory conditions, sleep EEG data were obtained from healthy subjects in three nights each. On the evening of the second night the volunteers received a single dosage of 2.5 mg Lorazepam; the other two nights were drug-free. The sleep profile and the quantitative EEG data reflected the known changes following acute administration of benzodiazepines: during the treatment night the amount of non-REM sleep and the relative power of the EEG signal in the beta and gamma frequency bands was increased relative to the first night, while the amount of REM sleep was reduced. The night of drug discontinuation still showed some characteristics of the treatment night. The discordance rate of the REM detection algorithm relative to the manual evaluation ranged from 9% to 14.2% for the different nights. Surprisingly, the percentage of correctly classified time periods was even higher for the lorazepam night as compared to the other nights.", 
    "1": "The decision on how to treat a patient does not depend on clinical matters or illness characteristics alone, but also on patient, physician and setting variables such as personality, training, or reimbursement. No research has yet been carried out to answer the question whether personal experience with medications also influences prescribing behavior. In this study, 124 physicians stratified according to specialty (neuropsychiatrists vs. general practitioners), type of institution (private practice vs. hospital), years of professional experience (young vs. old), and region (rural vs. urban) participated in a structured interview to evaluate their proneness to prescribe benzodiazepines for sleep disorders as well as their personal experience in taking benzodiazepines for their own sleep problems. Both specialty and personal experience were significantly related to proneness to prescribe. Other variables tested (region, institution, age, gender) did not help to explain the variance in benzodiazepine prescribing practice. Thus physician variables and, importantly, their own personal experience in taking the medication significantly influence treatment choice. Rational medical decision making and treatment guidelines must therefore take into account medical knowledge as well as knowledge of personal treatment preferences and professional biases.", 
    "2": "One model for addressing the dual disorders of substance abuse and a concomitant mental disorder in an acute-psychiatry inpatient ward of a VA Medical Center utilized psychoeducation and ward policies to empower patients to make decisions affecting their recoveries. Existing staff shared responsibilities for implementing activities and creating ward milieu that supported psychiatric patients toward a life free of alcohol and drugs as they gained in acceptance of responsibility for the management of their mental disorders. Integrated programming assisted patients in constructing a meaningful path of recovery out of multiple treatment approaches and philosophies. Treatment principles, ward policies, and goals for an integrated acute-psychiatry model evolved over 4 years. Designed from a consumer-oriented \"strengths perspective,\" patients responded to the new programming with satisfaction and gratitude. Recent adaptation of these policies, principles, and goals to a newly instituted continuous-care treatment program indicates the appropriateness of their application for outpatient dual disorder treatment and programming as well.",

Both substances are structurally very similar to the metabolites of diazepam 2-amino-5-chlorbenzophenone and 2-methylamino-5-chlorbenzophenone and their mobility on thin layer chromatograms is similar as well. This could cause their confusion and misinterpretation of the results. Therefore suitable combination of mobile phases and thin layer plates was sought in this study for the unambiguous identification of respective benzophenones by thin layer chromatography.",

All opioids and benzodiazepines were converted to their respective fentanyl and lorazepam equivalent units based on potency and bioavailability. Calculation of the weaning rate for each patient during tapering from opioid and benzodiazepine medications was performed. The presence or absence of acute withdrawal syndrome was identified for each patient. Nine (32.1%) patients developed acute withdrawal syndrome potentially related to the administration of analgesic or sedative medications. Patients in the withdrawal group received significantly higher mean daily (p = .049) and peak (p = .032) doses of fentanyl equivalents, as well as higher mean daily lorazepam equivalents (p = .049) compared with patients not experiencing withdrawal. Patients in the withdrawal group were also significantly more likely to have received neuromuscular blocking agents (p = .004) or propofol (p =.026) for >1 day during ICU admission compared with patients not experiencing withdrawal. Duration of mechanical ventilation (p = .049), benzodiazepine therapy (p = .048), and propofol therapy (p = .049) was also significantly longer in the group experiencing withdrawal. Withdrawal patients received a significantly lower mean daily dose of haloperidol (p = .026). There was a significant association between the development of withdrawal syndrome and the presence of ARDS (p = .017). Finally, the slopes of the lines representing opioid and benzodiazepine drug weaning were more steep for the withdrawal group, although these results did not achieve statistical significance.",

The association between ARDS and withdrawal syndrome, combined with the observation that withdrawal syndromes were also associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and prolonged mechanical ventilation, suggests that patients with ARDS may be more likely to receive high doses of analgesic and sedative medications, and are therefore at increased risk for withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "11": "This study investigated the role of maternal behavior on the long-term effects of postnatal manipulation (15 min of daily separation from the dam and exposure to clean bedding from Day 1 to Day 14 of postnatal life) on emotionality in the mouse. Mothers were treated with an antianxiety agent (Chlordiazepoxide: 5 mg/kg), daily upon removal of the litter from the nest. Emotionality in adult offspring was tested in the elevated plus maze. Mice manipulated during postnatal development were more explorative and less anxious than unhandled mice, but this effect was not observable in the offspring of Chlordiazepoxide-treated dams. No effect of maternal Chlordiazepoxide was observed in unhandled offspring. The pharmacological treatment of the mother did not affect either pups' ultrasonic calling during separation, or maternal behavior far apart from the daily manipulation sessions. By contrast, Chlordiazepoxide-treated dams were less responsive toward pups upon reunion following daily separation. This alteration of dams' behavior was not related to alterations in the amount of ultrasonic calls emitted by pups during reunion. Finally, when dams were daily injected with Chlordiazepoxide far apart from pups' removal, the pharmacological treatment was devoid of effects. These results support the view that the mother-infant interaction which follows separation plays a major role in determining the effects of postnatal manipulations on adult emotionality.",

Because, as a natural substance, melatonin cannot be patented, melatonin-related compounds have been synthesized by industrial groups. The scope of such compounds is also to specifically target the recently discovered melatonin receptor subtypes. The sleep-inducing properties of melatonin are disputed, but are distinct from those of benzodiazepines. The observed effects on sleep latency or sleep efficiency, which remain to be confirmed, could be accounted for by the effects of melatonin on core body temperature and on circadian rhythms. There is also an urgent need for safety data, both in animals and in humans, particularly when long-term use is envisaged.",

A variety of social, legal, and religious factors make reporting and data collection on suicide and nonfatal suicidal behavior difficult. To study the problem, a retrospective case-note analysis was carried out in which the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of 262 female and 185 male suicidal individuals admitted to a university hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, are compared. Three quarters of the suicidal persons were under the age of 30 years. Compared to men, women were younger and more often married. Both women and men tended to use self-poisoning with benzodiazepines, but more women used organophosphate insecticides. In Pakistani society, legal, social, and economic discrimination predisposes women to psychological distress and subsequent suicidal behavior. The study highlights the need for culture-specific research on suicidal behavior in Pakistan.",

Arterial plasma samples were obtained at 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 min after i.v. injection of the tracer, and were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The rate of plasma [11C]FMZ degradation was associated with a large individual variation, but no significant difference was found in the degradation of [11C]FMZ either between male and female, young and old, or between normal subjects and patient groups. When the mean fraction of unchanged [11C]FMZ at each time point was used instead of individually measured metabolite data for the arterial input function, as much as a 30% error occurred in the distribution volume of the [11C]FMZ binding in the brain. These results indicate that the mean percentage of unchanged [11C]FMZ fraction in subjects cannot be used as the standardized value, and that the analysis of metabolites in plasma is necessary to determine the exact arterial input function for quantitative PET measurement.", 
    "19": "Results from a computer model of a thalamic network predict that agents augmenting GABA(A)-mediated inhibition in the reticular thalamic (RE) nucleus will be antiepileptic or desynchronizing. This provides support for the hypothesis that antiepileptics like benzodiazepines may exert their effects through an isolated increase of inhibition in the RE nucleus. When desynchronized, the model thalamocortical neurons showed a decreased probability of firing a low threshold spike, a decreased secondary inhibitory postsynaptic potential and a higher frequency of oscillations. The transition to desynchrony was also accompanied by an increased frequency in the firing of the model RE neurons.", 
    "20": "1. SB-205384, and its (+) enantiomer (+)-SB-205384 were tested for their modulatory effects on human GABA(A) receptor subunit combinations expressed in Xenopus oocytes by electrophysiological methods. 2. The slowing of the decay rate induced by SB-205384 on native GABA-activated currents in rat neurones was also seen on GABA(A) currents in oocytes expressing human GABA(A) subunits. This temporal effect was observed for the alpha3beta2gamma2 subunit combination with little effect in subunit combinations containing either alpha1 or alpha2. 3. Potentiation of the peak amplitude of the GABA-activated currents by SB-205384 or (+)-SB-205384 was less specific for a particular subunit combination, although the greatest effect at 10 microM drug was seen on the alpha3beta2gamma2 subunit combination. 4. In contrast, zolpidem, a benzodiazepine site modulator, did not significantly slow decay rates of GABA(A) currents in oocytes expressing the alpha3beta2gamma2 subunit combination. Zolpidem, as expected, did selectively potentiate GABA-activated currents on oocytes expressing the gamma2 subunit compared to those containing the gamma1. 5. The results show that the novel kinetic modulatory profile of SB-205384 is selective for the alpha3beta2gamma2 subunit combination. This suggests that the compound is binding to a novel regulatory site on the subunit complex.", 
    "21": "1. The responses of the electrically-driven right ventricle strip of the guinea-pig heart to diazepam were recorded in the absence and in the presence of different selective cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. 2. Diazepam, at concentrations ranging from 1 microM to 100 microM, was devoid of effect on the contractile force in this preparation. 3. Conversely, diazepam (5 microM-100 microM) produced a consistent positive inotropic response in the presence of a concentration (1 microM), that was without effect in the absence of diazepam, of either of the selective PDE 3 inhibitors milrinone or SK&F 94120, but not in the presence of the selective PDE 4 inhibitor rolipram. 4. This effect of diazepam was not gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-dependent, since it was neither mimicked nor potentiated by GABA, and was not affected by either a high concentration (5 microM) of the antagonists of the benzodiazepine/GABA/channel chloride receptor complex, picrotoxin, flumazenil and beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (betaCCMe), or by the inverse agonists, beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid N-methylamide (betaCCMa) and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM, 0.1 microM). Furthermore, a specific antagonist of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, PK 11195 (5 microM), did not influence the effect of diazepam. 5. Biochemical studies with isolated PDEs, confirmed that diazepam selectively inhibits type 4 PDE from guinea-pig right ventricle rather than the other PDEs present in that tissue. The compound inhibited this enzyme in a non-competitive manner. Diazepam was also able to inhibit PDE 5, the cyclic GMP specific PDE absent from cardiac muscle, with a potency close to that shown for PDE 4. 6. Diazepam displaced the selective type 4 PDE inhibitor, rolipram from its high affinity binding site in rat brain cortex membranes, and also potentiated the rise in cyclic AMP levels induced by isoprenaline in guinea-pig eosinophils, where only type 4 PDE is present. 7. The PDE inhibitory properties of diazepam were shared, although with lower potency, by other structurally-related benzodiazepines, that also displaced [3H]-rolipram from its high affinity binding site. The order of potency found for these compounds in these assays was not related to their potencies as modulators of the GABA receptor through its benzodiazepine binding site. 8. The pharmacological and biochemical data presented in this study indicate that diazepam behaves as a selective type 4 PDE inhibitor in cardiac tissue and this effect seems neither to be mediated by the benzodiazepine/GABA/channel chloride receptor complex nor by peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "22": "Although psychotropic drugs have not been tested or approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use during pregnancy, some women continue to take these medications while they are pregnant, particularly since mood and anxiety disorders cluster in women during childbearing years. The relative risks and benefits of drug therapy for these women must be weighed with each patient and treatment limited to those situations in which risks to mother and fetus from the disorder are presumed to exceed the risk of drug treatment. Risks of psychotropic drug use during pregnancy include teratogenic effects, direct neonatal toxicity, and the potential for longer term neurobehavioral sequelae. Of growing concern is the risk of untreated psychiatric disorder as it may potentially affect fetoplacental integrity and fetal central nervous system development.

Variability in the disposition of anticonvulsants and interaction among them are important confounders of successful therapy. This article will provide a review of selected anticonvulsants, focusing on drugs most likely to control seizures in small animals. The proper use of anticonvulsants will be discussed, with emphasis on differences in individual drug disposition, detection of these differences, and rational approaches to responding to these differences by dose modification. The primary target of discussion will be treatment of generalized, tonic clonic seizures, the most common type afflicting small animals.

Anandamide decreased the 5-HT receptor bindings at concentrations of 1-100 microM, although it did not cause any change in benzodiazepine or GABA(A) receptor bindings. A high concentration of anandamide, 100 microM, significantly decrease both [3H]5-HT and [3H]ketanserin bindings. The present study revealed that the pharmacological activity of anandamide might be partially mediated through the 5-HT receptor.", 
    "26": "The study presented here compared the acute performance-impairing, subject-rated, and observer-rated effects of quazepam (15, 30, and 45 mg), triazolam (0.1875, 0.375, and 0.5625 mg), zolpidem (7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg), and placebo in nine healthy, non-drug-abusing humans. Quazepam, a trifluoroethylbenzodiazepine, was chosen for study because, when compared with triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, it is a relatively weak benzodiazepine-receptor ligand, and it may bind selectively to the BZ1 benzodiazepine-receptor subtype. Zolpidem, an imidazopyridine, is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic and was chosen for study because it is biochemically distinct from benzodiazepine hypnotics and also purportedly binds selectively to the BZ1 benzodiazepine-receptor subtype. Triazolam was chosen as the reference compound because it binds nonselectively to BZ1 and BZ2 benzodiazepine-receptor subtypes. Triazolam, zolpidem, quazepam, and placebo were administered orally in a double-blind, crossover design. Triazolam and zolpidem produced orderly dose- and time-related impairment of learning, performance, and recall, and produced sedative-like subject- and observer-rated drug effects. The behavioral pharmacologic profile of zolpidem and triazolam was indistinguishable in that at peak effect, the absolute magnitude of drug effect was comparable across the various measures. Quazepam, by contrast, did not impair performance on any task to a statistically significant degree, nor did it produce significant sedation as measured by subject- and observer-rated drug-effect questionnaires. Whether these effects are a result of the unique benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile of quazepam or the testing of insufficient dosages is unknown. Future research could extend the findings presented here by testing higher dosages of quazepam.", 
    "27": "Serotonin is implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders and in the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines. Preclinical studies with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, including ondansetron, show they have anxiolytic properties and that ondansetron suppresses withdrawal anxiety after abrupt discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine treatment. We evaluated the efficacy of ondansetron as an adjunctive medication in the discontinuation of benzodiazepines in long-term users. One hundred eight patients who had used alprazolam or lorazepam regularly for > 3 months entered, and 97 completed a randomized double-blind discontinuation treatment program during which they received either ondansetron 2 mg twice daily or placebo and flexibly tapered their benzodiazepine over a 6-week period. There were no significant differences between the patients who had entered and completed treatment. Three weeks postmedication, 63% of the patients discontinued use of benzodiazepine. The percentage of reduction of benzodiazepine daily dosage at all time points in the treatment trial was similar for the ondansetron and placebo groups. Ondansetron had no significant effects on severity of withdrawal symptoms or levels of anxiety. High placebo response may have prevented detection of an ondansetron effect. At 1 year follow-up, 68% of patients reported that they stopped using benzodiazepine. Patient characteristics were more important than ondansetron in tapered benzodiazepine discontinuation.",

Two thousand fifty-three blood tests were performed of which 207 in the Li\u00e8ge region. The results obtained at the national level are compared to those obtained at the level of the Li\u00e8ge region.

    "29": "The in vivo effects of olanzapine on the extracellular monoamine levels in rat prefrontal cortex (Pfc), nucleus accumbens (Acb) and striatum (Cpu) were investigated by means of microdialysis. Sequential doses of olanzapine at 0.5, 3 and 10 mg/kg (s.c.) dose-dependently increased the extracellular dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) levels in all three brain areas. The increases appeared 30 min after olanzapine administration, reached peaks around 60-90 min and lasted for at least 2 h. The highest DA increases in the Acb and Cpu were induced by olanzapine at 3 mg/kg but at 10 mg/kg in the Pfc. The peak DA increase in the Pfc (421% +/- 46 of the baseline) was significantly larger than those in the Acb (287% +/- 24) and Cpu (278% +/- 28). Similarly, the highest NE increase in the Pfc (414% +/- 40) induced by 10 mg/kg olanzapine was larger than those in the Acb (233% +/- 39) and Cpu (223% +/- 24). The DA and NE increases in the Pfc induced by olanzapine at 3 and 10 mg/kg (s.c.) were slightly larger than those induced by clozapine at the same doses. In contrast, haloperidol (0.5 and 2 mg/kg, s.c.) did not change Pfc DA and NE levels. Extracellular levels of a DA metabolite, DOPAC, and tissue concentrations of a released DA metabolite, 3-methoxytyramine, were also increased by olanzapine, consistent with enhanced DA release. However, olanzapine at the three sequential doses did not alter the extracellular levels of either 5-HT or its metabolite, 5-HIAA, in any of the three brain areas. In conclusion, the present studies demonstrate that in the case of sequential dosing olanzapine more effectively enhances DA and NE release in the Pfc than in the subcortical areas, which may have an impact on its atypical antipsychotic actions.", 
    "30": "Ginkgolic acid conjugates (GAC) (6-alkylsalicylates, namely n-tridecyl-, n-pentadecyl-, n-heptadecyl-, n-pentadecenyl- and n-heptadecenylsalicylates) isolated from the leaves of Indian Ginkgo biloba Linn., (IGb) were tested for their putative role in anxiety in rats. Elevated plus maze, open-field behaviour, novelty-induced feeding latency and social interaction were the rodent behavioural models used in this study. GAC (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg, each, p.o.) on single acute administration, showed dose-related changes in the behaviour. GAC (0.6 mg/kg) and DZ augmented open arm entries, the open arm/closed arm entries ratio and increased time spent in the open arm on the elevated plus maze. In the open field, GAC (0.6 mg/kg) and DZ significantly increased ambulation and reduced the immobility time. EGb 761 showed a similar profile. GAC (0.6 mg/kg) and DZ significantly attenuated the increased latency to feed in novel environment. By contrast, EGb 761 and Ginkocer further augmented feeding latency. None of the drugs tested showed any significant effect in the social interaction test. GAC showed consistent and significant anxiolytic activity in all the variables investigated. By contrast, EGb 761 and Ginkocer, which are devoid of GAC, did not evoke significant activity. However, increased rearing and decreased immobility time only in open field behaviour shown by EGb 761 may be due to some antianxiety activity of a lesser degree. Our observations suggest that GAC may be the active constituents of Ginkgo biloba responsible for the anxiolytic activity.", 
    "31": "Current data indicate that dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems interact. The role of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor subtypes in modulating dopamine neurotransmission, however, remains unclear. The noncompetitive AMPA antagonists, GYKI 52466 (5-40 mg/kg) and LY300164 (1-6 mg/kg), and the competitive AMPA antagonists, LY326325 (5-80 mg/kg) and NBQX (10-80 mg/kg), were compared to the dopamine antagonist, haloperidol (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), for their ability to inhibit dopamine-mediated behaviors after i.p. administration in mice. The behavioral paradigms included amphetamine- or dizocilpine-induced hyperactivity, amphetamine-induced stereotyped sniffing, and apomorphine-induced climbing and stereotyped sniffing. All four AMPA antagonists and haloperidol attenuated amphetamine- and dizocilpine-induced hyperactivity and decreased spontaneous locomotion. Haloperidol and GYKI 52466 were more potent against amphetamine than against dizocilpine. In contrast, LY326325 was more potent against dizocilpine than against amphetamine. The hyperactivity decreases by LY300164 and NBQX were most likely due to non-specific effects on motor behavior. The AMPA antagonists and haloperidol also attenuated amphetamine- induced stereotypy. Unlike haloperidol, however, GYKI 52466, LY300164, and NBQX failed to attenuate apomorphine-induced climbing and stereotyped sniffing. LY326325, on the other hand, attenuated apomorphine-induced stereotypy, but not climbing. These results indicate that AMPA receptor antagonists can attenuate the behavioral effects of drugs, such as amphetamine and dizocilpine, that increase dopamine neurotransmission. However, the behavioral effects of the direct dopamine agonist apomorphine are not consistently attenuated by AMPA antagonists. The competitive AMPA receptor antagonist LY326325 appears to have a profile distinct from both haloperidol and the other AMPA antagonists tested.", 
    "32": "It has been suggested that the increased reinforcement rate on a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate of responding (DRL) schedule observed following acute antidepressant administration in the rat is due to an improvement in timing accuracy. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of antidepressants in another schedule that requires accurate estimation of time intervals, the peak procedure. Three antidepressant drugs were tested, the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, zimelidine (10.0-40.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and clomipramine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg, i.p.). For reference, the full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (1.0-5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and the psychomotor stimulant, d-amphetamine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) were also tested. All doses of d-amphetamine tested significantly increased lever-pressing rates, whereas all the other compounds induced significant decreases in lever-pressing rates. Overall, the time at which the maximal lever-pressing rate occurred was not altered by any of the compounds, suggesting that timing accuracy was not significantly affected by any of the compounds administered. The only exception was zimelidine (40.0 mg/kg), which reduced the time at which the maximal lever-pressing rate occurred, although lever-pressing rates were also significantly reduced at this dose. These data suggest that previously reported antidepressant-induced improvement in performance on the DRL schedule may not have been due to improved timing accuracy per se but may have been due to a decrease in lever-pressing rates.", 
    "33": "Inevitably, the greater availability of more costly antipsychotic medications has resulted in attempts to regulate the use of these agents. Early objections over the cost of treatment with clozapine or risperidone have in part been mollified by preliminary statistics on the cost effectiveness of these agents. However, this issue is complex and requires careful consideration of pharmacoeconomic principles in the development and clinical distribution of novel antipsychotics. Future cost-effectiveness studies need to consider a balance of public and private perspectives. These studies should be conducted in several settings, preferably also within the context of broader, multimodal treatment intervention strategies.",

On the other hand, the expectation of superior efficacy, more benign side effect profile and potential to impact the longitudinal course of schizophrenia provide a rationale for the use of novel antipsychotics as a first-line treatment of schizophrenia.",

    "37": "The present study investigated the role of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in the hypersusceptibility to seizures induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) during diazepam withdrawal in mice, using behavioral and biochemical approaches. The seizure threshold of DMCM was markedly decreased during diazepam withdrawal, reflecting withdrawal hyperexcitability in response to physical dependence. The decrease in the seizure threshold of DMCM in diazepam-withdrawn mice was inhibited by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cycloheptan-5,10-imine maleate; 50 microg/kg, s.c.) and ifenprodil (20 mg/kg, i.p.). The effective doses of these compounds were lower than those required to prevent DMCM-induced seizures in chronically vehicle-treated mice. Since MK-801 and ifenprodil do not only bind to NMDA receptors but also to sigma receptors, the present study also investigated the effects of sigma receptor ligands. The decrease in the seizure threshold of DMCM in diazepam-withdrawn mice was not modified by the sigma receptor agonist, (+)-pentazocine (5 mg/kg, s.c.), or the sigma receptor antagonist, NE-100 (N,N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)phenyl]-ethylamine monohydrochloride; 5 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, the latency to the expression of wild running induced by intracerebroventricular administration of NMDA (60 ng/mouse) was also significantly lower in diazepam-withdrawn mice than in vehicle-treated control mice. On the other hand, there was no difference in the spermidine concentration between vehicle-treated control and diazepam-withdrawn mice. In a receptor binding experiment, the Bmax value for [3H]-MK-801 binding was significantly increased in cerebrocortical tissues from diazepam-withdrawn mice, while the Kd value did not change in either group. However, the acute addition of a high concentration of diazepam (10 and 100 microM) in vitro did not alter [3H]-MK-801 binding in cerebrocortical membrane preparations. The behavioral experiments suggest that NMDA receptor antagonists may suppress benzodiazepine withdrawal responses, while the biochemical study reveals upregulation of the NMDA receptor, which may play an important role in the hypersusceptibility to DMCM-induced seizure in diazepam-withdrawn mice.", 
    "38": "We examined the effect of oral midazolam premedication on postoperative behaviour. Seventy children (ASA Physical Status 1 and 2; aged 1-10 yrs) were assigned randomly in a prospective, blinded fashion to receive either midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 (maximum 10 mg) or placebo. Behaviour assessments were made prior to medication, during induction of anaesthesia and 15 min following arrival to recovery room. The baseline behavioural evaluation scores were not significantly different. The children receiving midazolam cried significantly less during induction (P < or = 0.02). At one week follow-up, eight of 35 subjects receiving placebo had experienced adverse behaviour changes (nightmares, night terrors, food rejection, anxiety, negativism); 19 of 35 of the midazolam group experienced these changes (P < or = 0.02). At four week follow-up, most behaviour changes had resolved. Children given preoperative oral midazolam were less likely to cry and fight while being anaesthetized, and preoperative sedation was associated with increased incidence of adverse postoperative behaviour changes.", 
    "39": "The effects of a daily program of various activities on disturbed behavior were studied prospectively in three patients with severe dementia. Prior to the study, patients had not responded to treatment with benzodiazepines and/or neuroleptics. The study consisted of three periods, each lasting for 4 weeks: i.e., baseline, intervention, and follow-up. During each period, behavior was assessed by means of observation scales: GIP, SDAS, and CGI. Psychotropic medication was held as constant as possible. During intervention, the patients took part in a program of activities, including group, musical, physical, and social activities. During baseline and follow-up, patients followed the regular ward activities. The patients showed different responses, probably related to personal interests. Possible implications for the treatment of patients with dementia, complicated by disturbed behavior, and suggestions for future research are discussed. The enthusiasm of the nursing staff dealing with these patients was a promising result.", 
    "40": "Recurring stupor can be caused by repeated metabolic, toxic or structural brain disturbances. Recently, cases of recurring stupor, with fast EEG activity were shown to display increased endogenous benzodiazepine-like activity during the episodes of stupor. Patients with recurring stupor underwent extensive metabolic and toxicologic screening, EEG and brain imaging. Endozepines and exogenously administered benzodiazepines were assayed in plasma and CSF by means of mass spectrometry. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist was administered and the behavioural and EEG responses monitored. Treatment with oral flumazenil was attempted in selected cases. Twenty patients were found with recurring stupor. Episodes had begun between ages 18 and 67 years, and in nine patients, had disappeared spontaneously after 4-6 years with symptoms. Stupor lasted hours or days. Onset of the episodes and frequency were unpredictable. Patients were normal between attacks. Stupor was characterized by initial drowsiness, staggering and behavioural changes, followed by deep sleep and spontaneous recovery with post-ictal amnesia. Biochemical screening and brain imaging were always normal. Ictal EEG showed fast background activity, and flumazenil transiently awoke the patients and normalized the EEG. In the nine cases examined, endozepine-4 levels were increased during the stupor. Oral flumazenil reduced the frequency of the attacks in three of these nine patients. Recurring episodes of stupor may be due to increased endozepine-4. We propose the term 'endozepine stupor' for such episodes. Endozepine-4 is an endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine recognition site at the GABAA receptor, with unknown molecular structure.", 
    "41": "The aims of our survey were to estimate the prevalence of hypnotic drug prescription in a representative sample of population in 5 cities of Northern Italy and to analyse the pattern of prescription of these drugs by general practitioners (GPs) and psychiatrists. The data were collected with the collaboration of pharmacists working in 145 pharmacies. All consecutive patients presenting a prescription for a hypnotic drug were interviewed by the pharmacists during a two-week period. The pharmacists interviewed 7744 consecutive patients. The highest prevalence of prescriptions for hypnotic drugs was found in the elderly and in women. The majority of prescriptions were for benzodiazepines (BDZ), with lorazepam and triazolam accounting for about 50% of the total prescriptions. Short-acting and ultra-short-acting BDZ were more frequently prescribed for sleep induction by GPs than by psychiatrists. Approximately 73% of subjects reported that they had been taking the prescribed drug for one year or more. The high proportion of long-term BDZ users may be a consequence of the short period surveyed, which produced data weighted toward long-term consumption. Our data, however, do not permit to establish whether long-term use is appropriate from a clinical point of view or is the consequence of a physical dependence. We must be aware that this practice needs to be studied more accurately, with the aim to assess the risk/benefit ratio of long-term BDZ use.",

    "46": "The pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216 (2-phenylpyrazolo-[4,3-c]-quinolin-3 (5H)-one, 0.05-2 mg/kg) and the beta-carboline ZK 93426 (ethyl-5-isopropyl-4-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, 1-10 mg/kg) benzodiazepine receptor antagonists were evaluated for their capacity to modulate the behavioral actions of ethanol in alcohol preferring and -nonpreferring rats. When alcohol-preferring rats were presented with a two-bottle choice test between ethanol (10% v/v) and a saccharin (0.0125% g/v) solution, both antagonists dose-dependently reduced intake of ethanol by 35-92% of control levels on day 1 at the initial 15 min interval of the 4 h limited access. Saccharin drinking was suppressed only with the highest doses. CGS 8216 (0.25 mg/kg) and ZK 93426 (4 mg/kg) unmasked the anxiolytic effects of a hypnotic ethanol dose (1.5 g/kg ethanol) on the plus maze test in alcohol-preferring rats, but potentiated the ethanol-induced suppression in alcohol-nonpreferring rats. CGS 8216 (0.25 mg/kg) and ZK 93426 (4 mg/kg) attenuated the ethanol (0.5 and 1.5 g/kg)-induced suppression in the open field in alcohol-nonpreferring rats; however, CGS 8216 potentiated the depressant effects of the lower ethanol dose (0.5 g/kg) in alcohol-preferring rats. These findings provide evidence that benzodiazepine receptor antagonists may differentially modulate the behavioral actions of ethanol in alcohol-preferring and-nonpreferring rats. It is possible that the qualitative pharmacodynamic differences seen in the present study may be related to selective breeding for alcohol preference. The findings indicate the potential for development of receptor specific ligands devoid of toxic effects which may be useful in the treatment of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",

However, statistical significance was not reached due to the few data points available from the published reports. Furthermore, the IMZ receptor index was lower in the epileptogenic area of patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsies compared with their contralateral side (p = 0.02; Wilcoxon-test). The IMZ receptor index showed a weak correlation with the regional cerebral blood flow independent of the evaluated region (r < 0.4; p < 0.05).", 
    "50": "The IMZ receptor index indicated to be a simple routine approach to estimate the fractional rate constant k3 (r = 0.67). The lower value of the receptor index within the epileptogenic area might be due to a lower receptor density. However in further studies, IMZ might be a helpful tool to find out subtle changes of the receptor affinity due to its approximately 30-fold higher ligand-receptor affinity compared to C-11-Flumazenil.",

Psychosis is reported in 30% to 50% of adult-onset patients, and many are misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Mood disorders are present in more than 25% and cognitive impairment in more than 20%. Treatment of psychosis with neuroleptics may not have a favorable risk/benefit ratio, but treatment with benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy may be efficacious. Metabolic diseases such as gangliosidosis are probably under-recognized as causes of neuropsychiatric illness. Increased awareness of these disorders will lead to accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment selection, and genetic counseling.", 
    "52": "Studies were conducted to ascertain any involvement of free radical mediated prooxidative processes in different brain regions following diazepam administration. A significant decrease in TBA reactive substance formation was observed in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and brain stem regions after single doses of 1.5, 3 and 6 mg/kg b.wt. For further studies rats were given diazepam (i.p.) at 3 mg/kg body weight dose and sacrificed after 1 h to follow changes in the pro/antioxidant status. An enhancement in the TBARS formation was found in the mitochondrial fractions from cerebral cortex and brain stem. This effect was highest in brain stem being 107% as compared to controls. In the post mitochondrial fraction, cerebellum showed 49% enhancement whereas decreased formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was observed in cerebral cortex and brain stem. Isozymes of superoxide dismutase showed a decrease in activity which was region dependent. Even though, total thiols were not significantly altered, free thiols showed depletion in cerebellum (39.8%) and brain stem (50%). Glutathione reductase activity was also decreased in cerebellum and brain stem. The results indicate that a single dose of diazepam causes free radical mediated changes and the modulatory response of antioxidant defences appears to be region specific.", 
    "53": "To characterize the nature of kainate (KA) receptors distinct in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, properties of depolarizations induced by pulses of KA or AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) applied to dendrites of CA3 neurons with micropipettes were studied in thin transverse slices of the guinea pig hippocampus. KA induced depolarizations at negligible latencies only when administered to the most proximal dendritic areas. The depolarization was unaffected by tetrodotoxin or by a decrease in Ca2+ and an increase in Mg2+ concentrations. The declining slope of the KA-induced depolarization was significantly slower than that of the AMPA-induced depolarization. In comparison with the AMPA-induced depolarization, the KA-induced depolarization was much less susceptible to antagonists such as 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI52466). 6, 7,8,9-Tetrahydro-5-nitro-1H-benz[g]indole-2,3-dione-3-oxime (NS-102) and (2S,4R)-4-methylglutamate (SYM 2081) were without effects. The threshold concentration of pressure-ejected KA to induce depolarizations was about 200 nM. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials elicited by mossy fiber stimulation were more potently suppressed by CNQX than by GYKI52466. These results indicate that receptors responsible for the slow KA depolarization in the CA3 region of the hippocampus are not AMPA receptors but KA receptors. They are localized in the most proximal part of the apical dendrite and distinct from those observed in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.", 
    "54": "There are many aspects of everyday life that provoke anxiety. Visits to hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics are among the most anxiety producing. Anxiety exists on a continuum from normal, which alerts us that we need to pay attention to what is happening to us, to severely dysfunctional, as occurs with some of the anxiety disorders. Regardless of where patients fall on the continuum, nursing interventions can be very helpful. The etiology of anxiety disorders is multidimensional, including genetic vulnerability, neurophysiological dysregulations, stressful life events, and developmental antecedents. Because of the complex nature of anxiety, treatment is usually a combination of medications (benzodiazepines and antidepressants), education (particularly self-management techniques), sensory interventions, psychotherapy, and cognitive-behavioral interventions. The nurse's role in assessment, intervention, and referral is critical.",

To manage the withdrawal syndrome in a way that is safe and humane for the patient, the nurse must understand the pharmacological principles underlying the drug use. Whereas supportive nursing care is often effective, many patients require some pharmacotherapy. Rating scales for assessing signs and symptoms of withdrawal and for placing patients in the most appropriate setting can be used to guide the clinical decision making process. The treatment of withdrawal should provide a link to other services that promote the recovery process.",

The number of entries and the time spent in the open arms of the maze were increased by GHB (50, 150, 250 mg/kg i.p.). This is classically considered as indicative of an anxiolytic effect of the drug. There was no sedative effect at these doses as measured by the spontaneous locomotor activity in the actimeter or the total number of arm entries. The anxiolytic properties of GHB were reversed by neither the GHB receptor antagonist, NCS-382 (6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5(H)-5-olylidene acetic acid) (300 mg/kg i.p.), nor the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (10 mg/kg i.p.). However the anti-anxiety effect of GHB was antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (10 mg/kg i.p.), suggesting an interaction of GHB with the GABA(A) receptor complex which mediates the anti-anxiety effect of benzodiazepines.",

The intravenous combination of a benzodiazepine plus ketamine, which has been found to be effective and safe in several conditions, was therefore used for 60 pediatric biopsies. In addition to pulse oximetry, a physician trained in airway management monitored the patient. The quality of sedation was acceptable (n = 7) or optimal (n = 53) in all cases. None of the patients required ventilation or intubation. A mild oxygen desaturation lasting 4 min or less was detected in 6 patients. None of the patients experienced major change in respiratory rate or blood pressure. The administration of ketamine and, in some cases, the biopsy puncture were associated with a mildly increased heart rate. In conclusion, a benzodiazepine plus ketamine provides effective deep sedation for renal biopsy in childhood.",

Receptor subtypes mediating the current responses were characterized by using pirenzepine, AF-DX116, 4-DAMP and atropine, which have different profiles of the affinity constants for muscarinic receptor subtypes. The muscarinic antagonists inhibited either CCh-evoked I(K-Ca) or Icat with different potencies.

In 1988, as a result of a campaign influencing both doctors and patients, a 38% reduction in the consumption of benzodiazepines, measured as the number of prescribed doses, was achieved. This reduction still persists. We have now attempted to reduce consumption even further by directly influencing the individual users. We gave them written information, insisted on personal attendance for each prescription renewal, and, for use at these consultations, introduced a new benzodiazepine journal for 60% of the users. Registration of the prescribed amounts of benzodiazepines was performed over two three-month periods, before and after the intervention. The final registration was made six months after the intervention period. The number of prescriptions, number of prescriptions per 1000 patients and the number of users remained unchanged. A 20% reduction in the amount of prescribed sedatives (hypnotics) and a 7% reduction in prescribed minor tranquillizers was achieved because of fewer doses per prescription. We conclude, that we did not manage to change the patients' behaviour, expressed as the number of prescriptions per 1000 patients, but the doctors were influenced to write out fewer doses per prescription. Important reductions in consumption may be achieved in primary interventions.",

In the conflict drinking test in rats used as a model of anxiety, the tested compounds exhibited anxiolytic-like activity. Compounds 1 and 2 administered in doses of 50-100 mg/kg produced an anticonflict effect in a dose-dependent manner. A distinct effect is observed after dose of 100 mg/kg of 1 and 2, comparable to those induced by 10 mg/kg of diazepam. The anticonflict effect of 3 was weak and dose independent. It was revealed only in one mean dose (50 mg/kg) but not in the higher doses.",

In vitro binding of [3H]PK-11195[1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoguinol ine carboxamide] to human gliomas in radioligand binding studies revealed a significantly higher level (about 3 fold) of PBR binding sites in both low grade and high grade gliomas as compared to normal cortex. The Bmax (mean +/- SD) of high and low grade gliomas, when entire tissue sections were measured by autoradiography, was 5.5 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg-tissue (n = 5) and 1.8 +/- 0.9 pmol/mg-tissue (n = 6), respectively, although it was evident that there was area of hot spots in the high grade tumors. This difference was significant (p < 0.05; two-tailed t-test). Similarly, the KD values (dissociation constant; nM) between the high (KD = 20.4 +/- 1.3 nM) and low (KD = 14.3 +/- 2.1 nM) grade gliomas were significantly different. A significant difference in binding site density (Bmax) between the two types of gliomas was also obtained in liquid scintillation measurements. The hot spot areas which showed the most intense binding of [3H]PK-11195 had KD of 24.5 +/- 1.0 nM and Bmax of 6.2 +/- 0.42 pmol/mg-tissue, values significantly higher (p < 0.05, two-tailed t-test) than those obtained when the entire tissue section was measured.

The study was based on longitudinal data from a case-control study of 668 individuals aged 75 and older. The elderly were examined extensively by physicians, and family interviews were assessed. Dementia diagnosis was made by using DSM-III-R criteria. Individuals with a history of continuous use of benzodiazepines (BDZ+) were compared with nonusers (BDZ-), with respect to the incidence of Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia at follow-up 3 years later. It was found that there was a significantly lower incidence of Alzheimer disease in the BDZ+ group than in the BDZ- group. This negative association remained significant when controlling for age, gender, level of education, use of nonsteriodal antiinflammatory drugs, and estrogens. These results suggest that benzodiazepines may have protective effects against the disease.", 
    "80": "We have recently reported inhibitory effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) on ion channel-mediated secretion of catecholamines in bovine adrenal medullary cells. Here, we report the effects of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E), an active metabolite of CBZ, and carbamazepine-10,11-diol (CBZ-D), a non-active metabolite, on 22Na+ influx, 45Ca2+ influx and catecholamine secretion in cultured adrenal medullary cells. CBZ-E, but not CBZ-D inhibited 22Na+ influx, 45Ca2+ influx and catecholamine secretion induced by carbachol or veratridine with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.26 or 0.68 microg/ml, respectively. CBZ-E also inhibited high K+-evoked 45Ca2+ influx and catecholamine secretion (IC50 = 0.3 microg/ml), but CBZ-D did not. These findings suggest that CBZ-E, but not CBZ-D, attenuates catecholamine secretion by inhibiting nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-associated ion channels, voltage-dependent Na+ channels and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the cells. This inhibition of CBZ-E as well as CBZ may be related to the clinical effects in neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "81": "The anxiolytic activity of diazepam (DZP) (0.25-1 mg/kg) was investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex. Diabetes was induced by injecting STZ IP (50 mg/kg; in citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Experiments were performed 72 h later. The rats were subjected to various anxiety paradigms, including the open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze behaviours and the social interaction tests. In addition, rat brain tribulin activity was also assessed as a biochemical marker of anxiety. The results indicate that diabetic rats showed significantly more anxiogenic activity in comparison to non-diabetic rats on open-field, elevated plus maze, zero maze and social interaction tests. In diabetic rats, brain tribulin activity (MAO-A inhibitory component) was significantly increased. DZP dose dependently produced anxiolytic activity on the various behavioural parameters in non-diabetic rats. DZP (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) partially reversed the anxiogenic behaviour of STZ diabetic rats in elevated plus maze and zero maze tests. However, in open field behaviour and social interaction tests significant anxiolytic activity was observed only at a higher dose of DZP (1 mg/kg). The findings indicate that STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited augmented anxiety on various experimental paradigms and that the anxiolytic effect of diazepam was less marked in diabetic rats as compared to their euglycaemic counterparts.", 
    "82": "Three experiments examined the effect of either withdrawal from diazepam, or repeated treatment with the convulsant, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), on behaviour and seizure threshold. The behaviours measured were on the elevated plus maze and in the four-plate test; seizure threshold was measured as dose of PTZ infused via the tail vein to the first clonic twitch. In experiment 1, we examined the effect of either single or repeated withdrawal from diazepam using a procedure in which the drug was administered SC in a slow release depot. Three cycles of withdrawal from diazepam were compared to a single withdrawal experience. A single withdrawal from diazepam following chronic treatment gave rise, 72 h following the last dosing, to behavioural changes, suggestive of anxiety, in both tests, but did not result in a reduced convulsant threshold. In contrast, repeated withdrawal resulted in a reduction in sensitivity in several measures of anxiety, but sensitised the mice to the convulsive effects of the PTZ. The unexpected failure to find an increased sensitivity to a convulsive agent following a single withdrawal from SC diazepam was examined in experiment 2. The seizure threshold following a single withdrawal of mice which had received diazepam chronically IP in aqueous vehicle was significantly reduced relative to vehicle-treated controls, whereas that of animals receiving the same dose SC in oil, was not. It is argued that the difference may arise from the animals treated repeatedly with IP diazepam unintentionally experiencing repeated withdrawal, since the half-life of the drug by this route is short. In experiment 3, repeated sub-convulsant PTZ treatment reduced the convulsant threshold (the dose of PTZ required to give rise to the first clonic twitch), but had no significant effect on the behavioural measures of anxiety compared to a single dose of PTZ or vehicle controls. The results suggest that repeated withdrawal from chronic treatments with diazepam sensitises mice to convulsant stimuli in a manner resembling the effects of repeated administration of sub-convulsant doses of PTZ, but that neither repeated PTZ nor repeated diazepam withdrawal results in increased sensitivity to anxiogenic stimuli; rather, repeated withdrawal from diazepam may reduce the susceptibility of mice to behavioural measures of anxiety.", 
    "83": "The effects of various factors, including the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype and the coadministration of flunitrazepam, on the steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of bromperidol and its reduced metabolite were studied in 62 schizophrenic inpatients receiving bromperidol 12 mg/day. By use of allele-specific PCR analysis, the wild type allele (CYP2D6*1A) and four mutated alleles causing either absent (CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*5) or decreased (CYP2D6*10) CYP2D6 activity were identified. The means (ranges) of the Css of bromperidol and reduced bromperidol corrected to the median body weight were 7.2 (1.3-17.4) and 2.2 (0.4-8.9) ng/ml, respectively. Neither the Css of bromperidol nor that of reduced bromperidol significantly differed among the patients with no (n = 28), one (n = 30) and two mutated alleles (n = 4). The patients coadministered with flunitrazepam (n = 52) had significantly (P < 0.05) higher Css of bromperidol, but not reduced bromperidol, than those not (n = 10). Age, sex and smoking had no significant effects on the Css of these compounds. The present study thus suggests that the polymorphic CYP2D6 is not involved in the metabolism of bromperidol and reduced bromperidol to a major extent. The coadministration of flunitrazepam inhibits the metabolism of bromperidol, but age, sex and smoking do not affect it.", 
    "84": "Eighteen patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and 4 patients with neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) underwent all-night polysomnographic recordings before and during clonazepam treatment. Ten normal control subjects and 4 non-akathitic psychiatric patients treated with neuroleptics underwent polysomnographic recordings, which were compared with those of the RLS and NIA patients, respectively. Daily treatment with 0.5 to 3 mg clonazepam improved subjective complaints of 17 out of 18 patients with RLS and all the 4 patients with NIA. All the 18 patients with RLS exhibited periodic limb movements (PLM) on the polysomnograms before treatment, but only 2 of 10 control subjects exhibited PLM. Three of the 4 patients with NIA exhibited PLM, but none of the 4 controls on neuroleptics showed PLM. Clonazepam decreased the total number of PLM per hour in patients of both RLS and NIA.", 
    "85": "The effects of 7-chloro-3,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-1H-4,1-benzothiazepine-2-on (CGP37157), an inhibitor of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange, on depolarization-induced intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients were studied in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons with indo-1-based microfluorimetry. A characteristic plateau in the recovery phase of the [Ca2+]i transient resulted from mitochondrion-mediated [Ca2+]i buffering. It was blocked by metabolic poisons and was not dependent on extracellular Ca2+. CGP37157 produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the amplitude of the mitochondrion-mediated plateau phase (IC50 = 4 +/- 1 microM). This decrease in [Ca2+]i was followed by an increase in [Ca2+]i upon removal of the drug, suggesting that Ca2+ trapped in the matrix was released when the CGP37157 was removed from the bath. CGP37157 also inhibited depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx at the concentrations required to see effects on [Ca2+]i buffering. Thus, CGP37157 inhibits mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange and directly inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, suggesting caution in its use to study [Ca2+]i regulation in intact cells.", 
    "86": "Using radioligand binding assays, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD's) for 37 antidepressants, three of their metabolites (desmethylcitalopram, desmethylsertraline, and norfluoxetine), some mood stabilizers, and assorted other compounds (some antiepileptics, Ca2+ channel antagonists, benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, antihistamines, and monoamines) for the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters. Among the compounds that we tested, mazindol was the most potent at the human norepinephrine and dopamine transporters with KD's of 0.45 +/- 0.03 nM and 8.1 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively. Sertraline (KD = 25 +/- 2 nM) and nomifensine (56 +/- 3 nM) were the two most potent antidepressants at the human dopamine transporter. We showed significant correlations for antidepressant affinities at binding to serotonin (R = 0.93), norepinephrine (R = 0.97), and dopamine (R = 0.87) transporters in comparison to their respective values for inhibiting uptake of monoamines into rat brain synaptosomes. These data are useful in predicting some possible adverse effects and drug-drug interactions of antidepressants and related compounds.", 
    "87": "Intravenous midazolam has been widely used in paediatric patients for conscious sedation in procedures such as endoscopy, oesophageal manometry, biopsy, bone marrow aspiration and lumbar puncture. Its advantages include quick onset and short duration of action, and haemodynamic stability which may be associated with improved patient acceptance. The pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam compares favourably with that of diazepam, permitting more controlled sedation with a quicker recovery time. Midazolam has been associated with shorter recovery room stays and less vomiting in children who undergo outpatient surgery. The safety and tolerability profile of midazolam in paediatric patients is comparable or superior to that observed in adults. Patients who are haemodynamically unstable, as well as pre-term and term infants are at greater risk of hypotension while receiving sedation. Thus, the availability of i.v. midazolam for use in children provides an important additional option for providing i.v. conscious sedation.", 
    "88": "The effect of carbamazepine, an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of alprazolam was examined in a double-blind, randomized crossover study with two phases. Seven healthy male subjects took carbamazepine 300 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 10 days, and on the 8th day they took a single oral 0.8 mg dose of alprazolam. Blood samples were taken and psychomotor function was assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale, and UKU Side Effect Rating Scale up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing. Carbamazepine significantly (p < .01 to .001) decreased the plasma alprazolam concentrations during the elimination phase. Carbamazepine significantly (p < .001) increased the apparent oral clearance (0.90 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.13 +/- 0.54 ml/min/kg) and shortened the elimination half-life (17.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.7 h), with no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration (11.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 13.0 +/- 3.5 ng/ml). The majority of psychomotor function parameters during the carbamazepine treatment were not significantly different from those during the placebo treatment, probably because of the sedative effect of carbamazepine itself. The present study suggests that carbamazepine decreases plasma concentration of alprazolam by inducing its metabolism. It also supports the previous studies, suggesting that alprazolam is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4.", 
    "89": "Some patients are anxious about routine dental treatment; others, who may be able to cope with uncomplicated treatment, are worried by more unpleasant procedures such as minor oral surgery. Management approaches to anxiety vary according to its severity, the age of the patient, the degree of cooperation and the patient's medical history. Psychological approaches have been widely used and range from informal and common-sense methods to formal relaxation training and hypnosis. These techniques are safe, free from adverse effects and give the patient a sense of control. An increasing number of patients are managed with conscious sedation techniques in combination with local anaesthesia and the more severely anxious and uncooperative may require treatment under general anaesthesia. As patient awareness of the risk of anaesthesia and the availability of sedation have increased, so the popularity of conscious sedation for dentistry has increased.", 
    "90": "In cerebellum, GABAA receptors containing alpha6 subunits are expressed exclusively in granule cells. The number of alpha6 receptor subtypes formed in these cells and their subunit composition presently are not known. Immunoaffinity chromatography on alpha6 subunit-specific antibodies indicated that 45% of GABAA receptors in cerebellar extracts contained alpha6 subunits. Western blot analysis demonstrated that alpha1, beta1, beta2, beta3, gamma2, and delta subunits co-purified with alpha6 subunits, suggesting the existence of multiple alpha6 receptor subtypes. These subtypes were identified using a new method based on the one-by-one immunochromatographic elimination of receptors containing the co-purifying subunits in parallel or subsequent experiments. By quantification and Western blot analysis of alpha6 receptors remaining in the extract, the proportion of alpha6 receptors containing the eliminated subunit could be calculated and the subunit composition of the remaining receptors could be determined. Results obtained indicated that alpha6 receptors in cerebellum are composed predominantly of alpha6betaxgamma2 (32%), alpha1alpha6betaxgamma2 (37%), alpha6betaxdelta (14%), or alpha1alpha6betaxdelta (15%) subunits. Other experiments indicated that 10%, 51%, or 21% of alpha6 receptors contained homogeneous beta1, beta2, or beta3 subunits, respectively, whereas two different beta subunits were present in 18% of all alpha6 receptors. The method presented can be used to resolve the total number, subunit composition, and abundancy of GABAA receptor subtypes in the brain and can also be applied to the investigation of other hetero-oligomeric receptors.", 
    "91": "Although GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) in principal cells have been studied in detail, there is only limited information about GABAARs in interneurons. We have used the patch-clamp technique in acute rat hippocampal slices in combination with single-cell PCR to determine kinetic, pharmacological, and structural properties of dentate gyrus basket cell GABAARs. Application of 1 mM GABA (100 msec) to nucleated patches via a piezo-driven fast application device resulted in a current with a fast rise and a marked biexponential decay (time constants 2.4 and 61.8 msec). This decay could be attributed to strong receptor desensitization. Dose-response curves for the peak and the slow component yielded EC50 values of 139 and 24 microM, respectively. Zn2+ caused a marked blocking effect on both the peak and the slow component via a noncompetitive mechanism (IC50 values of 8 and 16 microM). This led to an acceleration of the slow component as well as a prolongation of recovery from desensitization. Zn2+ sensitivity was suggested to depend on the absence of gamma-subunits in GABAARs. To test this hypothesis we performed single-cell reverse transcription PCR that revealed primarily the presence of alpha2-, beta2-, beta3-, gamma1-, and gamma2-subunit mRNAs. In addition, flunitrazepam increased the receptor affinity for its agonist, indicating the presence of functional benzodiazepine binding sites, i.e., gamma-subunits. Thus, additional factors seem to co-determine the Zn2+ sensitivity of native GABAARs. The modulatory effects of Zn2+ on GABAAR desensitization suggest direct influences on synaptic integration via changes in inhibition and shunting at GABAergic synapses.", 
    "92": "The functional characteristics of binding sites for the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) detected by radioautography in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn (DH) and on cultured neonatal DH neurons were studied on the latter using perforated patch-clamp recordings. The neurons were identified by their spike discharge properties and on the basis of the presence of met-enkephalin-like and glutamate decarboxylase-like immunoreactivities. OT (100 nM) never induced any membrane current at a holding potential of -60 mV but increased the frequency of spontaneously occurring AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs or the mean amplitude of electrically evoked EPSCs in a subset (35%) of neurons. The frequency of miniature EPSCs (m-EPSCs) recorded in the presence of 0.5 microM tetrodotoxin was also increased by OT (100 nM) without any change in their mean amplitude, indicating an action at a site close to the presynaptic terminal. The decay kinetics of any type of EPSC were never modified by OT. The effect of OT was reproduced by [Thr4, Gly7]-OT (100 nM), a selective OT receptor agonist, and blocked by d(CH2)5-[Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr-NH29]-ornithine vasotocin (100 nM), a specific OT receptor antagonist. Reducing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 2.5 to 0.3 mM in the presence of Cd2+ (100 microM) reversibly blocked the effect of OT on m-EPSCs. The OT receptors described here may represent the substrate for modulatory actions of descending hypothalamo-spinal OT-containing pathways on the nociceptive system.", 
    "93": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is not only widely expressed throughout the body, but it is also genetically conserved from bacteria to humans. Many functions have been attributed to it, but its primary role remains a puzzle. In the current study, we stably transfected cultures of MA-10 Leydig cells with either control or 18-kDa PBR antisense knockout plasmids. The antisense knockout vector was driven by the human enkephalin promoter, which contains two cAMP response elements, such that cAMP treatment of transfected cells could superinduce 18-kDa PBR antisense RNA transcription and, hence, down-regulate endogenous 18-kDa PBR mRNA levels. Control and knockout MA-10 cell lines were then compared at the level of receptor binding, thymidine incorporation, and steroid biosynthesis. Eighteen-kilodalton PBR knockout reduced the maximal binding capacity of tritium-labeled PBR ligands, and the affinity of receptors to the ligands remained unaltered. Additionally, 24-h accumulation of progesterone was lower in the knockout cells. Exposure of the two cell types to 8-bromo-cAMP resulted in a robust increase in steroid production. However, a complex pattern of steroid accumulation was observed, in which further progestin metabolism was indicated. The later decline in accumulated progesterone as well as the synthesis of androstenedione were different in the two cell types. At the level of cell proliferation, reduction of 18-kDa PBR mRNA showed no effect. Thus, we conclude that the 18-kDa PBR may have a more important role in steroidogenesis than in proliferation in this Leydig cell line.", 
    "94": "To determine the effect of upper airway (UA) negative pressure and collapse during inspiration on regulation of breathing, we studied four unanesthetized female dogs during wakefulness and sleep while they breathed via a fenestrated tracheostomy tube, which was sealed around the permanent tracheal stoma. The snout was sealed with an airtight mask, thereby isolating the UA when the fenestration (Fen) was closed and exposing the UA to intrathoracic pressure changes, but not to flow changes, when Fen was open. During tracheal occlusion with Fen closed, inspiratory time (TI) increased during wakefulness, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (155 +/- 8, 164 +/- 11, and 161 +/- 32%, respectively), reflecting the removal of inhibitory lung inflation reflexes. During tracheal occlusion with Fen open (vs. Fen closed): 1) the UA remained patent; 2) TI further increased during wakefulness and NREM (215 +/- 52 and 197 +/- 28%, respectively) but nonsignificantly during REM sleep (196 +/- 42%); 3) mean rate of rise of diaphragm EMG (EMGdi/TI) and rate of fall of tracheal pressure (Ptr/TI) were decreased, reflecting an additional inhibitory input from UA receptors; and 4) both EMGdi/TI and Ptr/TI were decreased proportionately more as inspiration proceeded, suggesting greater reflex inhibition later in the effort. Similar inhibitory effects of exposing the UA to negative pressure (via an open tracheal Fen) were seen when an inspiratory resistive load was applied over several breaths during wakefulness and sleep. These inhibitory effects persisted even in the face of rising chemical stimuli. This inhibition of inspiratory motor output is alinear within an inspiration and reflects the activation of UA pressure-sensitive receptors by UA distortion, with greater distortion possibly occurring later in the effort.", 
    "95": "Based on previous observations of very short periods of linearity for antiprogestin metabolite formation and the presence of a common tertiary amine moiety in each compound as the principal site of their metabolism, we hypothesized that mifepristone, lilopristone and onapristone are oxidized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to reactive nitroso species that complex the heme of the enzyme, thereby inactivating it. Upon preincubation with human liver microsomes in the presence (but not the absence) of NADPH, mifepristone inhibited midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, a marker of CYP3A4 catalytic activity, very potently (IC50 approximately 3.5 mumol/l) and extensively (by approximately 87%). Lilopristone and onapristone also displayed NADPH and time-dependent inactivation of CYP3A4 with characteristics very similar to mifepristone. These data support antiprogestin-mediated inactivation of CYP3A4 and suggest the potential for drug-drug interactions and time-dependent nonlinearities in pharmacokinetics upon their long-term administration.",

Forty-five children with childhood epileptic encephalopathies were identified. Patients were classified according to the international classification of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes, data were collected regarding age at onset, perinatal problems, presence of psychomotor retardation, radiological findings, etiology and response to therapy. Characteristics of responders versus non-responders were compared. The majority had West syndrome (29/45 or 64.4%). Of the total, 37/45 or 82.2% were symptomatic. The etiologic factors identified included perinatal problems in 24/45 or 53.3%, one patient with tuberous sclerosis and one with Aicardi's syndrome. Psychomotor retardation was seen in 95.5%. Cranial CT scan was normal in 11/26 or 42.3%. Abnormalities included infarcts (4/26), generalised atrophy and hydrocephalus (3/26), porencephalic cysts (2/26) and agenesis of corpus callosum, tuberous sclerosis, gliosis and subdural effusion (one each).

The EEG after-discharge, which was induced by the electrical stimulation of selected brain regions [(notably the dorsal hippocampus (Hip) and the amygdala (CAm)] was evaluated in rabbits pre- and post-drug administration. 3. In the animals submitted to electrical stimulation of the amygdala, flumazenil exerted a protective action, thereby inducing an increase in the after-discharge threshold and/or a decrease in after-discharge duration. 4. In the animals submitted to electrical stimulation of the hippocampus, flumazenil did not induced changes statistically significant. 5. Finally, the paper discusses the two possible mechanisms of action of flumazenil (a \"per se\" partial BDZ activity and/or a BDZ agonistic activity, which displaces the inverse agonist-like ligand) and the differencies in GABA distribution in the hippocampus and the amygdala.",

A number of animal studies have shown that the actions of numerous drugs can grow or sensitize with the passage of time following even a single treatment, to achieve results equal to or greater than those seen after chronic administration. 2.

It was suggested that the same results might be achieved by giving drugs once every one or two weeks rather than daily, or, even more likely, several-times-daily. 3. Here the authors review the clinical literature relevant to that hypothesis, as it relates to antidepressant therapies. 4. The evidence uniformly supports our earlier thesis that the therapeutic influence of antidepressants would grow with the passage of time, even as their pharmacokinetic actions are declining.",

When general anesthesia is required, the electroencephalogram (EEG) is used for monitoring the adequacy of treatment. The EEG findings may also be important in recognizing status epilepticus and monitoring its response to treatment when this is clinically difficult, as when it occurs in comatose or pharmacologically paralyzed patients or in the context of severe brain damage.

    "106": "Lindane is widely used as an insecticide and scabicide in mammals. High doses in chronic exposures caused hyperexcitability and convulsions and impaired motor activity involving GABA-ergic mechanism. To investigate the role of GABA/Benzodiazepine mechanism in the neurotoxicity of low doses of lindane, rats were administered 2, 3, or 5 mg/kg orally for 90 days and behavioural, electrophysiological, and neurochemical studies were conducted. The animals exposed to lindane exhibited increased geotaxis and decreased spontaneous drug-induced locomotor activity (which further potentiated by phenobarbitone and increased after leptazol). The EEG of the treated rats showed high voltage slow-wave activity (HVSA) patterns with occasional spindles (9-10 HZ-amplitude of 100 uv). A significant increase (p < 0.01) in GABA levels in cerebellum and significant increase in benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellar membrane measured by (3H)flunitrazepam binding were observed in the animals exposed to 3 and 5 mg lindane.

Bupropion and triazolam on average occasioned less than or equal to 40% drug-appropriate responding. d-Amphetamine, methylphenidate, and bupropion produced stimulant-like participant-rated effects, while triazolam produced sedative-like effects.

Other anaesthetic medication was similar in both groups. At the surgeon's request, N2O was turned off and midazolam or propofol infusions were discontinued. In the M group, flumazenil was given in refracted doses. Patients were asked to move hands and feet. The test was repeated immediately after the end of surgery.", 
    "118": "The median intraoperative wake-up times were 2.9 min in the M group and 16.0 min in the P group. The respective postoperative wake-up times were 1.8 and 13.9 min. The quality of both intra- and postoperative arousals was significantly better in the M group. Twelve patients in the P group could not be awakened intraoperatively within 15 min and were given naloxone. One of these patients woke up violently and dislodged the endotracheal tube. Another patient in the P group had explicit recall of the test, but no pain. Five patients in the M group became resedated in the recovery room. Cost of anaesthetic drugs was similar in both groups. Satisfactory intraoperative SCEPs were recorded from 17 patients in each group. There were no neurological sequelae.",

    "120": "The kinetics and pharmacology of the isoquinoline and benzodiazepine binding sites of the omega3 or peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors were studied using the specific ligands [3H] 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin -2-one ([3H]PK11195) and [3H]1-(2-Chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarb oxamide ([3H]RO5-4864), respectively. Binding of both ligands was saturable, reversible, displayed nanomolar affinity, and best fit to a single site model. Occipital cortex and cerebellum displayed highest and lowest densities of binding sites respectively; for both ligands. Bmax values of [3H]PK11195 were several-fold higher than that of [3H]RO5-4864 in all regions studied consistent with their binding to distinct subunits of the human peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor heteromeric complex. However, the isoquinoline and benzodiazepine ligands were found to be mutually competitive at nanomolar concentrations suggesting allosteric interactions between these two sites. Competition binding experiments showed that the binding of both ligands was displaced by diazepam with Ki values in the nM range, and by clonazepam in the microM range. The novel peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-N,N-di-n-hexyl-1H-indole-3-acetamide (FGIN1-27) displaced only [3H]PK11195 binding with high potency. Heterogeneity of the two sites is observed, manifested by their differential susceptibility towards detergents and alcohols. Histidine residue modification by diethylpyrocarbonate treatment abolished only [3H]PK11195 binding but had no effect on [3H]RO5-4864 binding. These studies demonstrate that the isoquinoline and benzodiazepine sites on the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in human brain manifest many pharmacological characteristics that are distinct from each other and from rodent brain peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "121": "The possibility that the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine can antagonize the ability of cocaine to produce both conditioned place preference and self-administration in rats was investigated. Pre-treatment with olanzapine (3.0, 4.5 mg/kg, but not 1.5 mg/kg) significantly attenuated conditioned place preference produced by cocaine (10 mg/kg). However, the higher dose of olanzapine administered alone resulted in conditioned place aversion. Pre-treatment with olanzapine also produced a dose-dependent decrease in cocaine self-administration (0.33 mg/infusion) under a fixed-ratio 2 schedule of reinforcement. Olanzapine produced a similar dose-responsive attenuation in operant responding for food (fixed-ratio 10) suggesting that olanzapine produces a nonspecific decrease in operant behavior. Pre-treatment with 4.5 mg/kg olanzapine significantly attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity, whereas lower olanzapine doses had little effect upon cocaine-induced hyperactivity. These results suggest that pre-treatment with olanzapine is capable of blocking the reinforcing effects of cocaine and illustrates the value of using multiple tests of reinforcement when evaluating the pharmacological effects of newer psychotherapeutic agents.", 
    "122": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors are the sites of action for many antiepileptic drugs such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates. We report the results of molecular cloning of the gamma1-subunit from seizure prone DBA/2J and resistant C57BL/6J inbred mice, and analyses of nucleotide sequences and expression of the gamma1-subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) in DBA/2 and C57BL/6 inbred mice. The mouse gamma1-subunit complementary DNA (cDNA) shares 98% similarity with that of the rat at the level of amino acid sequence. Northern blot hybridization indicates that the gamma1-subunit mRNA is expressed predominantly in areas other than the cerebral cortex and cerebellum and shows little change with postnatal development. No differences have been found for the subunit between DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice either for nucleotide sequence or for level of expression of the subunit's mRNA in whole brain by Northern blots at 3 weeks of age.", 
    "123": "In vitro binding profiles were determined for selected benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands by quantitative radioautography in rat brain. The ligands represent subtype-selective agonists (zolpidem) or nonselective BZR agonists (diazepam), as well as BZR partial agonists (bretazenil, Ro 43-9624, and Ro 19-8022). In addition, these compounds were evaluated in a precipitated withdrawal paradigm in monkeys. The physical dependence liability was not clearly related to the in vitro brain BZR binding profiles of these compounds. Therefore, diazepam, bretazenil, Ro 19-8022, and Ro 43-9624 had regional affinities for the 13 selected rat brain regions that were close to the mean values across regions, despite the clearly greater physical dependence potential of diazepam. Zolpidem, on the other hand, had regional affinities for the 13 rat brain regions that diverged significantly from the mean value across regions and exhibited a lower physical dependence potential than diazepam. These results raise the possibility that a combination of BZR subtype selectivity with partial agonism could yield a marked reduction of physical dependence liability.", 
    "124": "Considering the mechanisms responsible for age- and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neuronal degeneration, little attention was paid to the opposing relationships between the energy-rich phosphates, mainly the availability of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the activity of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme synthesizing the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Here, it is postulated that in all neuronal phenotypes the declining ATP-mediated negative control of GABA synthesis gradually declines and results in age- and AD-related increases of GABA synthesis. The Ca2+-independent carrier-mediated GABA release interferes with Ca2+-dependent exocytotic release of all transmitter-modulators, because the interstitial (ambient) GABA acts on axonal preterminal and terminal varicosities endowed with depolarizing GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors; this makes GABA the \"executor\" of virtually all age- and AD-related neurodegenerative processes. Such a role of GABA is diametrically opposite to that in the perinatal phase, when the carrier-mediated GABA release, acting on GABA(A)/chloride ionophore receptors, positively controls chemotactic migration of neuronal precursor cells, has trophic actions and initiates synaptogenesis, thereby enabling retrograde axonal transport of target produced factors that trigger differentiation of neuronal phenotypes. However, with advancing age, and prematurely in AD, the declining mitochondrial ATP synthesis unleashes GABA synthesis, and its carrier-mediated release blocks Ca2+-dependent exocytotic release of all transmitter-modulators, leading to dystrophy of chronically depolarized axon terminals and block of retrograde transport of target-produced trophins, causing \"starvation\" and death of neuronal somata. The above scenario is consistent with the following observations: 1) a 10-month daily administration to aging rats of the GABA-chloride ionophore antagonist, pentylenetetrazol, or of the BDZ antagonist, flumazenil (FL), each forestalls the age-related decline in cognitive functions and losses of hippocampal neurons; 2) the brains of aging rats, relative to young animals, and the postmortem brains of AD patients, relative to age-matched controls, show up to two-fold increases in GABA synthesis; 3) the aging humans and those showing symptoms of AD, as well as the aging nonhuman primates and rodents--all show in the forebrain dystrophic axonal varicosities, losses of transmitter vesicles, and swollen mitochondria. These markers, currently regarded as the earliest signs of aging and AD, can be reproduced in vitro cell cultures by 1 microM GABA; the development of these markers can be prevented by substituting Cl- with SO4(2-); 4) the extrasynaptic GABA suppresses the membrane Na+, K+-ATPase and ion pumping, while the resulting depolarization of soma-dendrites relieves the \"protective\" voltage-dependent Mg2+ control of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels, thereby enabling Ca2+-dependent persistent toxic actions of the excitatory amino acids (EAA); and 5) in whole-cell patch-clamp recording from neurons of aging rats, relative to young rats, the application of 3 microM GABA, causes twofold increases in the whole-cell membrane Cl- conductances and a loss of the physiologically important neuronal ability to desensitize to repeated GABA applications. These age-related alterations in neuronal membrane functions are amplified by 150% in the presence of agonists of BDZ recognition sites located on GABA receptor. The GABA deafferentation hypothesis also accounts for the age- and AD-related degeneration in the forebrain ascending cholinergic, glutamatergic, and the ascending mesencephalic monoaminergic system, despite that the latter, to foster the distribution-utilization of locally produced trophins, evolved syncytium-like connectivities among neuronal somata, axon collaterals, and dendrites, to bidirectionally transport trophins.

    "125": "Benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonists, used extensively for their anxiolytic effects, have been shown to increase food intake in many mammalian species. Little information, however, is available on the effects of BZR agonists on feeding behaviors of humans. Food intake was evaluated in a 60-minute free-feeding standardized test after the acute administration of the BZR agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP, Librium; 5 mg or 20 mg) or placebo. Subjects were 12 individuals with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a disorder characterized by extreme hyperphagia and morbid obesity, and 11 controls with obesity. PWS subjects showed the characteristic hyperphagia associated with the appetite disorder, consuming more than six times as many sandwiches as controls with obesity. Results revealed no significant effect of either dose of CDP on the food intake of either group. Serum assays revealed that dose-dependent, clinically effective levels of CDP and active metabolites were achieved. These results suggest that acute administration of the BZR agonist CDP, at the therapeutic levels used, may not increase food intake in populations with obesity. However, the chronic effects of CDP on appetite in human populations still need to be explored.",

The number of attempts at venous access and the gauge of the catheter used were also recorded. Baseline patient anxiety was similar between the two groups and both showed a significant improvement in patient anxiety at 30 minutes following drug administration. The diazepam group, however, had a significantly greater reduction in anxiety scores (p < 0.05). There were no differences in baseline vein quality between the two groups; however, the quality of the vein was subjectively improved following diazepam administration. The mean number of attempts at i.v. access between the diazepam group (1.26 +/- 0.56) and the placebo group (1.32 +/- 0.65) was not significantly different. However, the ability to place larger gauge catheters was significantly enhanced in the diazepam group.", 
    "132": "The administration of 5 mg oral diazepam prior to the establishment of i.v. access improved vein quality and decreased patient anxiety.

    "133": "We have attempted to clarify the mechanisms for alcohol (EtOH)-induced elevation of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) mRNA and to investigate whether the increase in DBI mRNA is paralleled with that in DBI using EtOH-treated mice and primary cultured neurons. Both the DBI content and the expression of DBI mRNA were elevated in the cerebral cortex of EtOH-inhaled and -withdrawn mice. Simultaneous administration of flunitrazepam (FLN) and Ro15-1788 with EtOH vapor completely abolished the EtOH-induced elevation of DBI mRNA. In addition, the exposure of the neurons for 3 days significantly elevated the expression of DBI mRNA, which was completely inhibited by concomitant exposure of FLN, Ro15-4513 and Ro-15-1788 with EtOH, while muscimol and bicuculline showed no effects on the EtOH-induced increase of DBI mRNA expression. These results indicate that functional interaction between EtOH and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors is a critical role in the increased expression of DBI mRNA.", 
    "134": "The effects of zolpidem 10 mg, flunitrazepam 1 mg, and placebo, administrated at bedtime, were studied in 12 healthy male insomniac patients. The assessments included polygraphic sleep recordings during the night and a battery of cognitive tests (sign crossing test, dichotic listening test, digit span test, visual recognition test and free recall test during four times during the following day. Compared with placebo, both active drugs improved sleep parameters. However, with zolpidem, the results were not statistically different from placebo. Zolpidem dit not alter sleep architecture in contrast to flunitrazepam, which significantly increased stage 2 and decreased slow wave sleep and REM sleep. No significant interaction was found between time of day for the evaluation of cognitive function. Flunitrazepam significantly impaired attention and memory compared with zolpidem and placebo, while zolpidem did not differ from placebo. These results indicate that zolpidem 10 mg preserved sleep structure and daytime cognitive functions in contrast to flunitrazepam."
