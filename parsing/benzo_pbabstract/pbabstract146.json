However, long term treatment is associated with development of benzodiazepine dependence. Besides development of physical dependence, which is linked to a typical benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when drug intake is discontinued, also behavioural addiction to benzodiazepines has been described. Benzodiazepines are known to enhance GABAergic neurotransmission. Counter regulation of enhanced GABAergic neurotransmission by enhancement of glutamatergic neurotransmission is thought to be one reason underlying the typical symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Also alterations in the expression of neuropeptides like Corticotropin Releasing Hormone and Neuropeptide Y are thought to be involved in the development of benzodiazepine dependence. However, until today the knowledge of neural mechanisms underlying the development of benzodiazepine dependence remains incomplete. Because even long term treatment with small doses of benzodiazepines is associated with adverse reactions like cognitive dysfunctions withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be aimed. Anticonvulsants and antidepressants seem to reduce the intensity of benzodiazepine withdrawal and to enhance long term prognosis of dependence.", 
    "1": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ischemia/reperfusion injury in the rat retina may be ameliorated by reducing retinal metabolism with either hypothermia or inhibitory GABA agonists. The intraocular pressure of each right eye in rats was raised to 130 mm Hg for 60 min with the left eye serving as normal control. The rats were divided into four groups in terms of drug and hypothermia treatment: (1) Untreated ischemia, (2) Hypothermia, (3) Baclofen/midazolam and (4) Baclofen/muscimol. Electroretinogram was recorded before ischemia and again after 10-day reperfusion. Histological analysis with H&E staining and cell counts was performed. Untreated ischemia/reperfusion resulted in severely reduced ERG responses. The ERG b-wave was reduced from 423+/-144 microV to 130+/-91 microV (mean+/-SD, n=5). With hypothermia the ERG b-wave was reduced from 499+/-80 microV to 237+/-111 microV (n=4). With combinations of baclofen and midazolam the ERG b-wave was reduced from 432+/-96 microV to 104+/-67 microV (n=7). In baclofen/muscimol treated eyes the ERG b-wave went from 426+/-101 microV to 148+/-118 microV (n=6). The histological tissue damage was severe in untreated ischemia and the baclofen/midazolam and baclofen/muscimol groups, but less severe in the hypothermia group. The GABA agonists do not provide any protection in our ischemia/reperfusion model. Our results are consistent with earlier reports that hypothermia may be helpful in ischemic conditions in the retina.",

Fluorescence intensity was used as a measure of protein association constant. Decrease in protein fluorescence, after titration with increasing concentration of porphyrins, gave evidence of interactions between PBR and examined ligands. Experimental data were fitted to theoretical curves, assuming different models of interactions. All examined ligands were best fitted to weak binding model. Increase in environmental acidity resulted in changes in association constants. For all examined derivatives association constants were at least twice higher in pH 5.5 as compared to pH 7.4 and 6.5.",

In the present study, long-term effects of soman poisoning on learning ability, memory and neurogenesis were investigated in rats, treated with the anticholinergic atropine and the oxime HI-6 for reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase. We also investigated whether sub-chronic treatment with the reported neurogenesis enhancer olanzapine would stimulate neurogenesis and possibly normalize the anticipated long-term deleterious effects of soman intoxication. Animals were treated with HI-6 (125 mg/kg i.p.), followed after 30 min by soman (200 microg/kg s.c.) and atropine sulphate (16 mg/kg i.m.) 1 min thereafter. Soman poisoning led to an elevation of extracellular acetylcholine levels to 1500% over baseline values as assessed by striatal microdialysis. Brain acetylcholinesterase was inhibited over 95%. This was accompanied by short recurrent seizures lasting for 40 min. Osmotic minipumps releasing olanzapine (7.5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle were subcutaneously implanted 24 h post-intoxication. After drug delivery for 4 weeks, newborn cells were BrdU labeled. Learning and memory performance were assessed 8 weeks after soman poisoning, followed by analysis of surviving newborn cells (BrdU) and neurogenesis (doublecortin, DCX). Eight weeks after soman-intoxication a significantly impaired learning ability was found that was paralleled by significantly lower numbers of DCX-positive cells but no changes in the number of BrdU-labeled cells. Apparently, the present Olanzapine regime was ineffective. We conclude that soman poisoning has long lasting effects on learning ability, a finding that was accompanied by impaired neurogenesis. Although we confirm a correlation between impaired neurogenesis and cognitive deficits, establishing the true causal relationship between these processes in OP exposed animals awaits future research.",

These effects were compared with classic BZs: flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and chlordiazepoxide. To assess the role of GABA(A) receptor subunits on USVs, drugs that have preferential actions at different GABA(A)-alpha subunits (L-838417 and QH-ii-066) were tested. Seven-day-old CFW mouse pups were separated from their dam and littermates and placed individually on a 19 degrees C test platform for 4 min.

    "15": "A dynamic equilibrium between covalent 1:1 hairpin and 2:1 duplex DNA adducts of a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) minor groove binding agent () has been observed for the first time. The equilibrium, which establishes over 1 hour and must require unfolding of both types of adducts, is surprising given that PBDs normally require DNA minor groove structure for binding and take 24 hours for complete reaction with duplex DNA. The equilibrium is interesting from an energetics perspective due to the well known DNA stabilizing effect of PBDs. This observation could have significance for the in vitro and in vivo biological activity of PBDs, as DNA hairpin and loop structures are known to be important in cellular processes such as transcription and replication.",

Benzodiazepines or older standard antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin) have typically been used as initial intravenous treatment of GCSE. As new parenteral antiepileptic drugs are developed, and more are on the horizon, questions are raised regarding their role in the treatment of status epilepticus (SE). This review discusses the evidence for the treatment of GCSE, including the newer agents (valproate, levetiracetam). We correlate the treatment of SE with our modern understanding of the underlying neurophysiology and seizure duration.", 
    "17": "Banned amphetamine-based anorectics are illicitly imported into the United States (US), but little is known regarding the harm these diet pills pose to US residents. A 26-year-old woman using imported diet pills presented with a two-year history of intermittent chest pains, palpitations, headaches and insomnia. Urine toxicology screen detected amphetamines and benzodiazepines. Fenproporex and chlordiazepoxide were detected in her pills. Her symptoms resolved after she stopped using diet pills. A 38-year-old man using imported diet pills presented after his occupational urine screen was significantly positive for amphetamine. Fenproporex and fluoxetine were detected in his pills. These cases illustrate the potential harm from imported prescription diet pills that combine fenproporex with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, diuretics, laxatives and other substances. Increasing physicians' awareness of imported diet pill use may improve care of patients suffering from the pills' many adverse effects.", 
    "18": "The aim was to study the introduction of the new low dose transdermal buprenorphine (LD-TD-BUP) in Norway, particularly with regard to former use and co-medication with other potentially addictive drugs. The nationwide Norwegian Prescription Database contains information on all prescription drugs dispensed to individual non-institutionalised patients, and we may follow all individuals who received LD-TD-BUP (Norspan) after marketing on the Norwegian market on 15/11/05. We studied all prescriptions of opioids and other potentially addictive drugs to patients receiving at least two LD-TD-BUP prescriptions during 2004-2006. Poisson regressions were run with concomitant use of addictive drugs (yes, no) as the endpoint. Overall, 1884, non cancer individuals received at least two prescription of LD-TD-BUP. Of these 91.7% received prescriptions of other opioids and 58.6% of them had also been prescribed benzodiazepines/carisoprodol before the prescription of LD-TD-BUP. Of the LD-TD-BUP users who received more than one prescription, 60% co-medicated with at least one other potentially addictive drug, and 24% with at least two. In the multivariate analysis, the variables associated with a higher likelihood of using co-medicated drugs were: previous use of benzodiazepines/carisoprodol relative risk RR=16.7 (95% CI 10.4-26.9), previous use of opioids RR=4.0 (1.9-8.7) and younger age 20-40 years RR=1.9 (1.6-2.3). So far, it is questionable whether the introduction of LD-TD-BUP actually has stabilised opioids consumption or whether it has complicated and increased the consumption of potentially addictive drugs.",

Despite its reported high prevalence, remains under-recognized and under-treated. The diagnosis is based on the presence of four essential criteria, three supportive clinical features, and other three associated features. The primary or idiopathic RLS is the most common presentation form, but it is very important to exclude other RLS secondary forms and other differential diagnosis. The physiopathology of the idiopathic RLS remains unclear, however changes in the dopamine pathway have been proposed, and justifies the use of dopaminergic agents as first line treatment.

    "41": "There are numerous sedatives and analgesics used in critical care medicine today; these medications are used on critically ill patients, many of whom have heart disease, including coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. The purpose of this review is to recognize the effects of these medications on the heart. Studies that evaluated the effects of sedatives and analgesics on normal individuals or on those with heart disease were reviewed. Current choices for sustained sedation in the critically ill include the benzodiazepines, morphine, propofol, and etomidate. Each of these medications has their particular advantages and disadvantages. Benzodiazepines provide the greatest amnesia and cardiovascular safety but they can cause significant hypotension in the hemodynamically unstable patient. Morphine provides analgesia and cardioprotective activity after ischemia, although the large observational study CRUSADE showed increased mortality rate in those patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction who received morphine. Propofol is the most easily titratable drug with cardioprotective features, but its use must be accompanied with great attention to possible development of propofol infusion syndrome, which is a deadly disease, especially in patients with head injury and those with septic shock receiving vasopressors. Etomidate has a rapid onset effect and short period of action with great hemodynamic stability even in patients with shock and hypovolemia, but the incidence of adrenal insufficiency during infusion, not bolus doses, may cause deterioration in the circulatory stability. In conclusion, the sedatives and analgesics mentioned here have characteristics that give them a cardiovascular safety profile useful in critically ill patients.

Anxiety has been found to increase the risk of developing CHD in healthy subjects and can lead to worsening of existing CHD. There is much overlap and confusion throughout the research literature between what authors define as anxiety, stress, Type A behavioral pattern, and anger/hostility.There is a need for better screening within the practice of cardiology for these psychosocial risk factors to ensure better integration of mental health services. Established screening tools such as the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale are described and compared with the newer Screening Tool for Psychologic Distress as part of the initial work-up of every cardiac patient. Recommendations are made using the author's Anxiety Treatment Algorithm regarding when to refer to a mental health professional along with how to reduce stigma and provide more integrated care. The diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is reviewed, with attention to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress reduction, and behavioral medicine group programs. These group programs are recommended because they help to overcome social isolation and counsel patients on how to adapt to a healthy lifestyle.

Current treatment options for HE include agents that reduce the concentration of these toxins, such as nonabsorbable disaccharides and antibiotics. Several studies have evaluated the use of rifaximin in the treatment of HE. They include a dose-finding study, 9 open-label studies, and 4 double-blind studies comparing rifaximin with either nonabsorbable disaccharides or antibiotics. Commonly used outcomes in most of these studies were changes in portal systemic encephalopathy index and the improvement in HE grade. Despite various limitations of the studies, rifaximin showed superior efficacy compared with lactulose for the treatment of HE, similar efficacy to paromomycin, and similar or greater efficacy than neomycin.

    "56": "Ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors control the relay of nociceptive signals at several levels of the neuraxis. Experiments with systemically applied benzodiazepines, which enhance the action of GABA at these receptors, have suggested both anti- and pronociceptive effects. The interpretation of such experiments has been notoriously difficult because of confounding sedation. Here, we have used genetically engineered mice, which carry specific benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA(A) receptor subunits, to test whether diazepam, a frequently used classical benzodiazepine, exerts antihyperalgesia after systemic administration in the formalin test, a model of tonic nociception. In wild-type mice, systemic diazepam (3-30 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently reduced the number of formalin-induced flinches during both phases of the test by about 40-70%. This antinociception was reversed by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil (10mg/kg, i.p.), but fully retained in GABA(A) receptor alpha1 point-mutated mice, which were resistant against the sedative action of diazepam. Experiments carried out in mice with two diazepam-insensitive subunits (alpha1/alpha2, alpha1/alpha3 and alpha1/alpha5 double point-mutated mice) allowed addressing the contribution of alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 subunits to systemic diazepam-induced antihyperalgesia in the absence of sedation. The relative contributions of these subunits were alpha2 approximately alpha3>alpha5, and thus very similar to those found for intrathecal diazepam (0.09 mg/kg). Accordingly, SL-651498 (10mg/kg, p.o.), an \"anxioselective\" benzodiazepine site agonist with preferential activity at alpha2/alpha3 subunits, significantly reduced formalin-induced flinching in wild-type mice. We conclude that systemic diazepam exerts a genuine antihyperalgesic effect, which depends on spinal GABA(A) receptors containing alpha2 and/or alpha3 subunits.",

However, the discovery of subtype-selective compounds has been hampered by the lack of a high-throughput functional assay and the difficulty in establishing stable cell lines expressing GABAA receptor in a proper subunit composition. To meet drug discovery need we developed a fluorescent imaging plate reader(FLIPR)-based membrane potential assay with sufficient robustness and reproducibility for use in a high-throughput format. Two major subtypes of GABAA receptor were used: GABAA1 and GABAA2, which are composed of (alpha1)2(beta2)2gama2 and (alpha1)2(beta3)2gama2, respectively. We expressed the receptors by transiently co-transfecting cells with the three subunit DNAs in separate constructs, and by controlling the ratio of the DNA amount for each subunit transfected we forced the cells to express GABAA receptors in a pharmacologically relevant form. A large batch of transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cryopreserved and used to screen and evaluate GABAA modulators.In these cells, agonist activation of GABAA receptor resulted in Cl- efflux and membrane depolarization, which was detected by FLIPR as an increase in fluorescence signal. Based on our characterization of several known GABAA modulators and a test set of compounds known to bind to the GABAA benzodiazepine site, we have demonstrated the validity and utility of this assay for discovery of novel pharmacological agents acting at GABAA receptors.",

The goal of this study was to identify an affective concomitant linked to diazepam-induced aggression that might be responsible for this relationship. Thirty males (15 diazepam and 15 placebo) participated in the Taylor Aggression Paradigm while covertly being videotaped. The videotapes were analyzed using the Facial Action Coding System with the goal of identifying facial expression differences between the two groups. Relative to placebo participants, diazepam participants selected significantly higher shock settings for their opponents, consistent with past findings using this paradigm. Diazepam participants also engaged in significantly fewer appeasement expressions (associated with the self-conscious emotions) during the task, although there were no group differences for other emotion expressions or for movements in general.",

A low level of education (primary school or illiteracy) was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of all types of insomnia in the urban sample. Current smokers and current drinkers were less likely to report any type of insomnia in the rural sample. Unemployment was associated with DMS in the urban sample, while it was associated with DIS and DMS in the rural sample.

All agents caused marked motor incoordination in the rotarod test and muscle flaccidity in the traction test until 15 min after recovery of righting reflex. Thereafter, the short-acting hypnotics zolpidem and brotizolam showed a faster recovery than the long-acting benzodiazepine flunitrazepam. However, head twitch responses were observed in the mice treated with flunitrazepam, but zolpidem and brotizolam had no such effect. The flunitrazepam-induced head twitch response was antagonized by ketanserin, a 5- HT(2A) receptor antagonist. These results indicate that flunitrazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine that is nonselective for type I and II benzodiazepine receptors, induces head twitch responses with muscle flaccidity after recovery from the loss of righting reflex caused by these drugs. In addition, these findings suggest the involvement of a 5-HT(2A)-GABA(A) receptor/benzodiazepine interaction in this phenomenon.",

Several drugs including benzodiazepines and dantrolene were ineffective, although treatment with baclofen or carbamazepine was effective. These findings suggest that hyperexcitability of the anterior horn cells following the disturbance of spinal inhibitory interneurons was involved. Electophysiological studies suggested the disturbance of left lumber nerve roots. The spinal root blocks from L3 to S1 were performed, after which the painful involuntary muscle spasm was resolved. The lumbar sympathetic ganglia block was also effective; suggesting that abnormal afferent neuronal input to spinal cord was caused by the nerve root trauma which triggered the formation of secondary abnormal network in the spine. Lumbar sympathetic ganglia block should be recommended to a therapeutic option for the refractory painful muscle spasm of the leg.",

    "100": "Benzodiazepines of natural origin (NBZDs) have been found in human blood and brains as well as in medicinal plants and foods. In plasma and brain tissue there are i.e. diazepam and nordiazepam equal to commercial drugs but there are also other benzodiazepine-like compounds termed \"endozepines\", which act as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors of central type (CBR). A synthetic pathway for the production of NBZDs has not yet been found, but it has been suggested that micro-organisms may synthesize molecules with benzodiazepine-like structures. Hence NBZDs could be of both endogenous and exogenous source and be considered as natural anxyolitic and sedative. Interestingly there are also natural compounds, such as the polypeptide Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI) acting as an \"inversive agonist\" implicated in fair and panic disorders. It has been suggested that NBZDs may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Multidirectional studies evaluated NBZDs levels (1) in the blood of normal subjects, of cirrhotic with or without HE and in commercial benzodiazepine consumers; (2) in the blood of cirrhotic treated or not with a non-absorbable antibiotic; (3) in several constituents of our diet. In conclusion, NBZDs increase sometime in cirrhotics with or without HE but they reach concentrations not higher than those found in commercial benzodiazepines consumers. Hence NBZDs must be considered as occasional precipitating factor of HE and benzodiazepine antagonists only symptomatic drugs. The finding that NBZDs may be in part synthesized by intestinal bacterial flora and in part constituent of our diet underlines the importance to feed cirrhotic patients with selected food.", 
    "101": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon, but potentially life threatening complication of neuroleptic drugs. In 1960, Delay et al. [Ann Med Psychol 118 (1960) 145-152] described the \"syndrome akin\u00e9tique hypertonique\"(hypertonic akinetic syndrome) and its cardinal symptoms: hyperthermia, extrapyramidal symptoms, altered mental status and autonomic dysfunctions. The syndrome often develops after a sudden increase in dose of neuroleptic medication or in states of dehydration. The frequency of NMS with conventional neuroleptic drugs ranges from 0.02 to 3.3%. The pathophysiology of NMS is not clearly understood. It has been suggested that the potential to induce NMS of neuroleptics is parallel to the potency of dopamine blockade in the nigrostriatal tract, mesocortical pathway and hypothalamic nuclei. It is, however, intriguing that NMS may appear with atypical antipsychotics (AA) and especially clozapine (CLZ), which is mainly characterized by its low affinity to D1 and D2 receptors.",

The occurrence of NMS when prescribing AA and especially CLZ is, however, intriguing, given its low potency to block D2 receptors.

    "111": "With a lifetime prevalence of up to 25% anxiety disorders are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric disorders. The etiology of anxiety is considered to be multifactorial with an interaction of neurobiological, psychological and environmental factors. With regard to neurobiological factors, several neurochemical systems and neuroanatomical circuits have been discussed to be involved. In particular, anxiety might be a result of insufficient inhibitory control, pointing towards a major role of the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) system in these disorders. Preclinical and clinical studies discuss a decreased GABAergic inhibition in anxiety and patients with anxiety disorders. In view of these findings it is intriguing that benzodiazepines, which currently represent the most potent and powerful anxiolytic agents, act through an enhancement of GABAergic inhibition targeting the GABAA receptor. Thus, it has been suggested that the GABAergic system might represent a promising future target for new pharmacologic strategies for the treatment of anxiety. Closely linked to the GABAergic system is the endocannabinoid system, which might also play an important role in this group of disorders. The endocannabinoid system has particularly been involved in extinction learning, suggesting a key role of this system in the process of fear extinction. In this paper, both the GABAergic and the endocannabinoid system will be reviewed with regard to their role in anxiety and anxiety disorders in humans with particular attention to findings from genetic and neuroimaging studies. Moreover, both systems will be discussed as potential therapeutic targets.", 
    "112": "It is important to gain more insight into neurodegenerative diseases, because these debilitating diseases can not be cured. A common characteristic of many neurological diseases is neuroinflammation, which is accompanied by the presence of activated microglia cells. In activated microglia cells, an increase in the expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) can be found. The PBR was suggested as a target for monitoring disease progression and therapy efficacy with positron emission tomograpy (PET). The PET tracer [(11)C]PK11195 has been widely used for PBR imaging, but the tracer has a high lipophilicity and high non-specific binding which makes it difficult to quantify uptake. Therefore, efforts are being made to develop more sensitive radioligands for the PBR. Animal studies have yielded several promising new tracers for PBR imaging, such as [(11)C]DAA1106, [(18)F]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]PBR28, [(11)C]DPA713 and [(11)C]CLINME. However, the potential of these new PBR ligands is still under investigation and as a consequence [(11)C]PK11195 is used so far to image activated microglia cells in neurological disorders. With [(11)C]PK11195, distinct neuroinflammation was detected in multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, encephalitis and other neurological diseases. Because neuroinflammation plays a central role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, anti-inflammatory drugs have been investigated for therapeutic intervention. Especially minocycline and cyclooxygenase inhibitors have shown in vivo anti-inflammatory, hence neuroprotective properties, that could be detected by PET imaging of the PBR with [(11)C]PK11195. The imaging studies published so far showed that the PBR can be an important target for monitoring disease progression, therapy response and determining the optimal drug dose.", 
    "113": "Drug repositioning strategy is an interesting approach for pharmaceutical companies; especially to increase their productivity. SELNERGY(tm) is a reverse docking based-program able to virtually screen thousands of compounds on more than 2000 3D biological targets. This program was successfully applied to tofisopam and revealed that the isomers of tofisopam are able to fit with phosphodiesterase 4. This old drug was used as a racemic mixture to treat anxiety in the eighties and was recently shown to act as a PDE4 inhibitor. Thanks to this strategy we demonstrated that tofisopam acts via the inhibition of PDE4 in the submicromolar range. Moreover, we firstly showed that the S-enantiomer of tofisopam is ten times more active than R-enantiomer. The identification of the biochemical mechanism of tofisopam isomers now allows to reposition this drug in new therapeutic indications where modulation of cAMP via PDE4 inhibitors are possible.",

We identified a 3-generation family with progressively severe phenotypes of hyperekplexia. All affected family members were found to be heterozygous for a novel arginine271proline mutation in GLRA1. Long-term follow-up of the affected members of the third generation, now aged 6 and 7 years, reveals enhanced startle responses and persistent hypertonia of the extremities without clonus or a catch, tight heel cords and abnormal toe-walking gait, and plantar flexor reflexes. The 7-year-old child recently reponded well to a benzodiazepine. Future studies are warranted to examine whether this new missense mutation is solely responsible for this atypical phenotype.", 
    "119": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor alpha5 subunits, which are heavily expressed in the hippocampus, are potential drug targets for improving cognitive function. They are found at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites and have been shown to mediate tonic inhibition in pyramidal neurons. We tested the hypothesis that alpha5 subunits also contribute to synaptic inhibition by measuring the effect of diazepam (DZ) on spontaneous and stimulus-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in genetically modified mice carrying a point mutation in the alpha5 subunit (alpha5-H105R) that renders those receptors insensitive to benzodiazepines. In wild type mice, DZ (1 microM) increased the amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) and stimulus-evoked GABA(A,slow) IPSCs (eIPSCs) and prolonged the decay of GABA(A,fast) sIPSCs. In alpha5-mutant mice, DZ increased the amplitude of a small-amplitude subset of sIPSCs (<50 pA) and eIPSCs (<300 pA) GABA(A,slow) and prolonged the decay of GABA(A,fast) sIPSCs, but failed to increase the amplitude of larger sIPSCs and eIPSCs GABA(A,slow). These results indicate that alpha5 subunits contribute to a large-amplitude subset of GABA(A,slow) synapses and implicate these synapses in modulation of cognitive function by drugs that target alpha5 subunits.",

The efficiency of autogenous training was found to be higher in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and mildly or moderately compromised psychological adaptation associated with a moderately elevated level of anxiety. Psychopharmacotherapy proved to be especially efficacious in patients with hypochondriac, depressive, and manifest anxiety disorders. It was found that the pronouncedness of rigidity, tension, fixation-proneness, and the degree of depression could be used as predictors of positive effects of psychopharmacotherapy on stool patterns while hypochondriac trends served as predictors of the alleviation of pain syndrome in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and constipation.",

Currently, the dose system based on the mass is widely used in which doses are expressed in grams or milligrams. On the other hand, the molar dose system is in direct relation to the number of molecules. Hence, the objective of this work was to compare both systems in order to find their advantages and disadvantages. Active substances belonging to the groups of antibiotics, nootropic agents, beta-blockers, vitamins, GABA-analog, COX-2 inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, lipid-modifying agents (fibrates), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (profens), estrogens, neuroleptics, analgesics and benzodiazepines were considered. Moreover, products containing two active substances were also taken into account. These are mixtures of hydrochlorothiazide with active substances influencing the renin-angiotensin system and combined oral contraceptives. For each active substance, belonging to the groups mentioned above molar doses were calculated from mass doses and molar mass. Hence, groups of drugs with a single active substance, drugs with similar pharmacological activities, pharmaceutical alternatives, and drugs with a single active ingredient manufactured in different doses were compared in order to find which dose system describes more adequately differences between and within the groups mentioned above. Comparisons were supported by a number of equations, which theoretically justify the data, and relationships derived from calculations.", 
    "123": "Insomnia is common in older people and can be associated with significant daytime dysfunction. Sleep problems, and the medications used to treat them, may contribute to the risk of falls and fractures in this population; however, the independent effects of disturbed sleep or the risk of hypnotic use are not well understood. Data arising from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) cohort of elderly women have confirmed the link between sleep problems (measured subjectively or objectively) and an increased risk of falls after taking into account the use of insomnia medications (benzodiazepines) in a community-dwelling population of older women. The data also suggest that benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, although this association is less clear-cut when insomnia/sleep problems are taken into consideration. The risk of falls should be considered when prescribing benzodiazepines in this population. So far no data exist concerning whether the effective treatment of insomnia in the elderly may help prevent falls. Furthermore, studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the non-benzodiazepine BZRAs (benzodiazepine receptor agonists) in relation to risk of falls. In addition, there is a need to include fall risk factors such as postural sway and reaction time as outcomes for trials of new insomnia treatments.",

Therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines has been proposed, although the exact pathomechanism is not clear. The objective of this study is to define the possible reasons for the efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of the burning mouth syndrome. Starting from the report of eight cases successfully treated with prazepam, the present authors examined the clinical features and the evidence from literature that support the possibility of a role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of the burning mouth syndrome. Available data suggest that the nervous system could be crucial in the pathogenesis of the syndrome (altered perception of pain, disturbance of neural transmission, increased excitability, negative involvement of trigeminal-vascular system), and the present authors' experience lets them suppose a role for neuroinflammation. This hypothesis could also explain the positive response to benzodiazepines in some patients. The important role of neuroinflammation in dermatologic and oral diseases has been only recently investigated and acknowledged. Further studies on the connection between neuroinflammation and burning mouth syndrome could open interesting perspectives in the understanding and management of this difficult clinical condition.",

Rats, in the vehicle-dimethyl sulfoxide- or DHEA-treated senescent group, received 2% of dimethyl sulfoxide or DHEA (intraperitoneally) every other day besides D-galactose (subcutaneously) once a day. Rats in the DHEA-treated normal group received physiological once a day and DHEA every other day. After 8-week, spatial learning was assessed for 5 days by water maze methods. Following behavioural testing, the cerebral cortex mitochondria were purified for PK11195 binding analysis. When compared to the respective vehicle, D-galactose alone induced a significant impairment in water maze performance accompanied by a reduction (30.7%) in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density of mitochondria, and DHEA displayed a significant enhancement in learning memory accompanied by the elevation (18.3%) of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density but not affinity in senescent rats. DHEA showed insignificant effects on both learning/memory ability and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in normal rats when compared to physiological saline. These results suggest that chronic treatment with DHEA enhance cognitive function and increase peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in cerebral cortex mitochondria in middle-aged senescent rats.",

Our hypothesis is that patients with chronic liver disease who were marijuana users will have inferior survival. This is a retrospective (1999-2007) cohort study. The primary outcome measure is time-dependent, adjusted patient survival from the time of liver transplant evaluation. The primary exposure variable is a positive cannabinoid toxicology screen during the liver transplant evaluation period. Overall, 155 patients qualified as marijuana users while 1334 patients were marijuana non-users. Marijuana users were significantly (p < 0.05) younger (48.3 vs. 52.1), more likely to be male (78.1% vs. 63.0%), have hepatitis C (63.9% vs. 40.6%) and were less likely to receive a transplant (21.8% vs. 14.8%). Marijuana users were more likely to use tobacco, narcotics, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, cocaine or barbiturates (p < 0.05). Unadjusted survival rates were similar between cohorts. Upon multivariate analysis, MELD score, hepatitis C and transplantation were significantly associated with survival, while marijuana use was not (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.54).

Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) [TAK-390MR] is a modified-release formulation of dexlansoprazole (TAK-390), an enantiomer of lansoprazole, which employs an innovative Dual Delayed Release technology designed to prolong the plasma dexlansoprazole concentration-time profile following once-daily oral administration. As with lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and CYP2C19. Based on in vitro studies, dexlansoprazole has the potential to inhibit activity of these isoenzymes and also may induce human hepatic CYP1A and CYP2C9 activity. To determine whether dexlansoprazole has an effect on these isoenzymes in vivo, drug interaction studies with dexlansoprazole MR were conducted.",

Our studies have demonstrated that reducing carbohydrate excipients play a fundamental role in the generation of triazolaminoquinoleine, with lactose as the main one responsible, through a Maillard reaction. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed degradation mechanism, p-nitrobenzaldehyde has been employed as a model of reaction of the nucleophylic attack of amino-opened structure of alprazolam to an aldehyde to generate the first intermediate involved in Maillard reaction, a Schiff base. This model enables the identification of all the intermediates by mass spectrometry and/or nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, with the outcome of this experiment leading to a full understanding of the generation pathway.

    "151": "The role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT)2C receptors in anxiety and the anxiolytic effects of drugs is well documented. In view of the withdrawal anxiety associated with repeated diazepam intake, the present study concerns the efficacy of 5-HT2C receptors in rats treated with diazepam. Results show that diazepam injections at a dose of 2 mg/kg daily for two weeks increased weekly food intake and growth rate. Anxiolytic effects of the drug monitored in a light/dark activity box were not significant after single administration. One week and two weeks of administration elicited anxiolytic effects, which were smaller after two weeks of administration as compared to one week, suggesting the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic profile of diazepam. Moreover, three days' withdrawal from repeated administration elicited anxiogenic behavior in the light/dark activity box. The behavioral and neurochemical effects of 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP) (3 mg/kg), a 5-HT2C agonist, were monitored following withdrawal (three days) from two weeks of diazepam administration. Results showed that hypophagic as well as anxiogenic-like effects of m-CPP were not different from repeated saline or repeated diazepam-injected animals. Administration of m-CPP increased 5-HT metabolism in repeated saline as well as repeated diazepam-injected animals. However, m-CPP-induced increases in 5-HT metabolism were greater in repeated diazepam-injected animals. Results are discussed in the context of the role of 5-HT2C receptors in the precipitation of withdrawal anxiety.", 
    "152": "The use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics continues to excite controversy. Views differ from expert to expert and from country to country as to the extent of the problem, or even whether long-term benzodiazepine use actually constitutes a problem. The adverse effects of these drugs have been extensively documented and their effectiveness is being increasingly questioned. Discontinuation is usually beneficial as it is followed by improved psychomotor and cognitive functioning, particularly in the elderly. The potential for dependence and addiction have also become more apparent. The licensing of SSRIs for anxiety disorders has widened the prescribers' therapeutic choices (although this group of medications also have their own adverse effects). Melatonin agonists show promise in some forms of insomnia. Accordingly, it is now even more imperative that long-term benzodiazepine users be reviewed with respect to possible discontinuation. Strategies for discontinuation start with primary-care practitioners, who are still the main prescribers.This review sets out the stratagems that have been evaluated, concentrating on those of a pharmacological nature. Simple interventions include basic monitoring of repeat prescriptions and assessment by the doctor. Even a letter from the primary-care practitioner pointing out the continuing usage of benzodiazepines and questioning their need can result in reduction or cessation of use. Pharmacists also have a role to play in monitoring the use of benzodiazepines, although mobilizing their assistance is not yet routine. Such stratagems can avoid the use of specialist back-up services such as psychiatrists, home care, and addiction and alcohol misuse treatment facilities.Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine dependence have been reviewed in detail in a recent Cochrane review, but only eight studies proved adequate for analysis. Carbamazepine was the only drug that appeared to have any useful adjunctive properties for assisting in the discontinuation of benzodiazepines but the available data are insufficient for recommendations to be made regarding its use. Antidepressants can help if the patient is depressed before withdrawal or develops a depressive syndrome during withdrawal. The clearest strategy was to taper the medication; abrupt cessation can only be justified if a very serious adverse effect supervenes during treatment. No clear evidence suggests the optimum rate of tapering, and schedules vary from 4 weeks to several years. Our recommendation is to aim for withdrawal in <6 months, otherwise the withdrawal process can become the morbid focus of the patient's existence. Substitution of diazepam for another benzodiazepine can be helpful, at least logistically, as diazepam is available in a liquid formulation.Psychological interventions range from simple support through counselling to expert cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Group therapy may be helpful as it at least provides support from other patients. The value of counselling is not established and it can be quite time consuming. CBT needs to be administered by fully trained and experienced personnel but seems effective, particularly in obviating relapse.The outcome of successful withdrawal is gratifying, both in terms of improved functioning and abstinence from the benzodiazepine usage. Economic benefits also ensue.Some of the principles of withdrawing benzodiazepines are listed. Antidepressants may be helpful, as may some symptomatic remedies. Care must be taken not to substitute one drug dependence problem for the original one.", 
    "153": "Recent reports implicate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). We investigated the role of PARP-1 in the NF-kappaB signalling cascade induced by ionizing radiation (IR). AG14361, a potent PARP-1 inhibitor, was used in two breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of constitutively activated NF-kappaB, as well as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) proficient or deficient for PARP-1 or NF-kappaB p65. In the breast cancer cell lines, AG14361 had no effect on IR-induced degradation of IkappaBalpha or nuclear translocation of p50 or p65. However, AG14361 inhibited IR-induced NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. Similarly, in PARP-1(-/-) MEFs, IR-induced nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 was normal, but kappaB binding and transcriptional activation did not occur. AG14361 sensitized both breast cancer cell lines to IR-induced cell killing, inhibited IR-induced XIAP expression and increased caspase-3 activity. However, AG14361 failed to increase IR-induced caspase activity when p65 was knocked down by siRNA. Consistent with this, AG14361 sensitized p65(+/+) but not p65(-/-) MEFs to IR. We conclude that PARP-1 activity is essential in the upstream regulation of IR-induced NF-kappaB activation. These data indicate that potentiation of IR-induced cytotoxicity by AG14361 is mediated solely by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation.",

Attention training [ATT; Wells, A. (1990). Panic disorder in association with relaxation induced anxiety: an attentional training approach to treatment. Behavior Therapy, 21, 273-280] is a technique designed to increase attentional control and flexibility, and thereby lessen the impact of these maintaining factors. The main aim of this study was to determine whether or not supplementing cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) with ATT could potentiate greater changes in social anxiety, depression, attentional control, metacognitive beliefs, and anticipatory and post-event processing in a clinical sample with social phobia. Patients (N=81) were allocated to CBGT with ATT or relaxation training (RT). ATT did not potentiate greater change on any outcome variable, with both groups achieving significant improvements on all measures. Exploratory correlational analyses (pre-treatment and changes scores) showed that some metacognitive beliefs were associated with attentional control, anticipatory processing, and symptoms of social anxiety and depression. However, attentional control was more consistently associated with anticipatory processing, post-event processing, and symptoms of social anxiety and depression, than with metacognitive beliefs. Results are discussed with reference to cognitive behavioral models of social phobia. It is tentatively concluded that while supplementing CBGT with ATT does not improve outcomes, increasing attentional control during CBGT is associated with symptom relief.", 
    "155": "To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating cytogenesis within the neocortical ventricular zone, we examined at high resolution the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Ngn2 and Tbr2. Individually DiI-labeled daughter cells were tracked from their birth in slice cultures and immunostained for Ngn2 and Tbr2. Both proteins were initially absent from daughter cells during the first 2 h. Ngn2 expression was then initiated asymmetrically in one of the daughter cells, with a bias towards the apical cell, followed by a similar pattern of expression for Tbr2, which we found to be a direct target of Ngn2. How this asymmetric Ngn2 expression is achieved is unclear, but gamma-secretase inhibition at the birth of daughter cells resulted in premature Ngn2 expression, suggesting that Notch signaling in nascent daughter cells suppresses a Ngn2-Tbr2 cascade. Many of the nascent cells exhibited pin-like morphology with a short ventricular process, suggesting periventricular presentation of Notch ligands to these cells.", 
    "156": "Clinical observations indicate that antipsychotic action starts early and increases in magnitude with repeated treatment. Animal models that faithfully capture this time course of action are few. Inhibition of hyperlocomotion induced by amphetamine or phencyclidine has been widely used as a screening tool for the antipsychotic activity of a drug. We thus investigated whether repeated antipsychotic treatment could produce an early-onset and progressively increased antagonistic effect on amphetamine or phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion as a way of assessing the validity of such models in capturing time course of antipsychotic action. On each of the five consecutive test days, different groups of rats (n=6-7/group) received an initial injection of either haloperidol (0.01-0.10 mg/kg, sc), clozapine (5-20.0 mg/kg, sc), olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, sc), chlordiazepoxide (10.0 mg/kg, ip) or vehicle (sterile water, sc) 30 min prior to a second injection of either amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg, sc) or phencyclidine (3.2 mg/kg, sc). Motor activity was subsequently monitored for 60 min after amphetamine or phencyclidine treatment. Repeated treatment of haloperidol, clozapine, or olanzapine progressively potentiated inhibition on repeated phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion and prolonged this action over the five consecutive days. In contrast, antipsychotic inhibition on repeated amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was gradually attenuated and shortened. Repeated treatment of chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, retained its inhibition on amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, but had no effect on phencyclidine-induced one. These results suggest that repeated phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion model based on repeated antipsychotic treatment regimen is capable of capturing the progressive increase pattern of antipsychotic treatment seen in the clinic and differentiating antipsychotics from anxiolytics; thus it may serve as a better model for the investigation of the neurobiological mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs and delineating the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",

The whole procedure including the chip and the control software was designed and constructed in our own laboratory. The detection of 7-ACZP could be completed within 5 min. The results demonstrated that under the optima conditions, 7-ACZP residues could be detected with a precision of 5% relative standard deviation (RSD), and the linear range and the limit of detection (LOD) for 7-ACZP were 1.1-60.1 and 0.021 ngmL(-1), respectively. This method was compared with ELISA and showed a good correlation. This microfluidic chip with LIF detection was applied to the determination of 7-ACZP residues in positive human urine samples, and the results were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). This ultrasensitive detection technique was proved to be practical for clinical use.", 
    "158": "One study in sedated patients demonstrated a reduction in pain score but not midazolam dosage when warm water infusion was used to manage colonic spasm. We describe pilot data with a modified warm water infusion technique. We tested the hypothesis that patients receiving even only half of the usual dose of sedation medications would have acceptable cecal intubation and tolerate the procedure well, based on retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a single Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center. Group 1 included 32 consecutive patients who received full-dose and group 2 included 43 consecutive patients who received half-dose premedication. Insertion of colonoscope was aided by warm water infusion in lieu of air insufflation. Pain scores during insertion, cecal intubation rate, and total amount of medications were monitored. The novel technique permitted equal cecal intubation rate at reduced total dose of medications. Pain scores were not significantly different. The uncontrolled nonrandomized observational nature of the data is one limitation. The nonsignificant difference in pain scores may be affected by a type II error. These pilot data suggest that insertion is feasible without air when water infusion is used. The novel technique may be a useful adjunct for minimizing the dosage of sedation medications without adversely affecting cecal intubation. Further study is needed to compare air insufflation and water infusion with regard to patient tolerance and success, particularly in the presence of an on-demand sedation policy.",

The Notch1 receptor is cleaved and activated via the gamma-secretase complex. Downregulation of Notch1 signaling by gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) thus represents a potential novel therapeutic approach. In this study, we analyzed the response of four T-ALL cell lines to compound E, a potent gamma-secretase inhibitor, and to the combination of compound E with vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase (L-ASP), and dexamethasone (DEX). We identified two distinct types of responses: In type 1 cell lines, represented by TALL1 and HSB2, GSI-induced apoptosis followed cell cycle arrest and enhanced the induction of apoptosis caused by DEX and L-ASP. In type 2 cell lines, represented by CEM and Jurkat J6, GSI caused neither cell cycle block nor cell death. Notably, the combination of GSI with chemotherapy-induced resistance by decreasing apoptosis. In type 2 cells, GSI induced the upregulation of Bcl-xl mRNA and protein, which was thus identified as a candidate mechanism for the inhibition of apoptosis. In conclusion, the data presented here caution against clinical use of a combination treatment of GSI and chemotherapy in T-ALL.",

    "164": "Insomnia is a complaint of patients seen in many medical settings, but it is particularly prevalent in patients who present to mental health practitioners. When choosing an intervention for insomnia, physicians often turn to pharmacological management options as their primary strategy, with other modalities only considered secondarily, if at all. Medications for insomnia, which include benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines, and antihistamines, have been found to have both varying degrees of efficacy as well as side-effect profiles that may limit their use. In recent years, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has studied nonpharmacologic interventions for insomnia and found evidence to support their use in achieving sustained improvements in sleep parameters over time. Methods such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, stimulus-control therapy, relaxation, paradoxical intention, and sleep restriction are efficacious treatments that mental health practitioners can consider in the treatment of insomnia. Researchers are only beginning to review evidence concerning complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM); however, given the preponderance of patients who may be employing these techniques for insomnia, it is important that clinicians be familiar with these approaches, which merit further study. This article reviews nonpharmacologic treatments for insomnia that are available to mental health practitioners as well as primary care providers, either via direct application of the techniques or by referral. The evidence for each of these modalities is presented in an effort to expand the treating physician's armamentarium beyond sole use of the medications traditionally used to treat insomnia.",

We have systematically mapped the nature and extent of MK-801-induced neurodegeneration throughout the neonatal murine brain in order to genetically dissect the mechanism of these effects. Highest levels of MK-801-induced neurodegeneration are seen in the cerebellar external germinal layer; while mature neurons of the internal granule layer are unaffected by MK-801 treatment. Examination of external germinal layer neurons by electron microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, and caspase-3 activation demonstrate that these neurons die through the process of programmed cell death soon after they exit from the cell cycle. Significantly, ablation of caspase-3 activity completely inhibited the MK-801-induced (and developmental) programmed cell death of external germinal layer neurons. Similar to caspase-3, inactivation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in vivo using scopolamine inhibited MK-801-induced programmed cell death. By contrast, the GABAergic agonist diazepam, either alone or in combination with MK-801, enhanced programmed cell death within external germinal layer neurons. These data demonstrate that, in vivo, cerebellar granule neurons undergo a dramatic change in intracellular signaling in response to molecules present in the local cellular milieu during their first 24 h following exit from the cell cycle.", 
    "176": "DNA binding of two hybrid ligands composed of an alkylating pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) moiety tethered to either a naphthalimide or a phenyl benzimidazole chromophore was studied by DNA melting experiments, UV and fluorescence titrations, CD spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Binding of both hybrids results in a remarkable thermal stabilization with an increase of DNA melting temperatures by up to 40 degrees C for duplexes that allow for a covalent attachment of the PBD moiety to guanine bases in their minor groove. CD spectroscopic measurements suggest that the naphthalimide moiety of the drug interacts through intercalation. In contrast, the PBD-benzimidazole hybrid binds in the DNA minor groove with a preference for (A,T)(4)G sequences.

Nearly half of our patients died without access to palliative care. Compared to the patients who had received palliative care, these patients showed less often pain and more often dyspnea. Invasive medical interventions and use of antibiotics were more frequent in patients who died without access to palliative care. Benzodiazepines were used less frequently compared to palliative care patients. In patients who died without access to palliative care, communication with the patient was inferior as compared to palliative care patients.

Groups of animals were administered differing doses of midazolam by the intramuscular, intranasal or sublingual route at either the onset of seizure activity or 40 min. after the onset of seizure activity that was detected in the electroencephalographic record. When given immediately after seizure onset, the anticonvulsant ED50 of intramuscular midazolam was significantly lower than that of intranasal midazolam, which in turn was significantly lower than sublingual midazolam at that time. At the 40-min. treatment delay, the anticonvulsant ED50s of intramuscular or intranasal midazolam did not differ and both were significantly lower than the sublingual route. Higher doses of midazolam were required to stop seizures at the 40-min. treatment delay time compared to immediate treatment.

An analysis of the ethical issues and an evidence-based review of the consequences of different attitudes and treatments with regard to prison medicine were carried out. Insomnia is a public health problem and requires adequate evaluation and treatment to avoid more serious health consequences both within and outside correctional institutions. Insomnia treatment in places of detention is an ethical dilemma, but there is no evidence-based reason to avoid benzodiazepines in prison completely and to use only neuroleptics and antidepressants, which might represent more dangerous and less efficient treatment. In prison medicine, should we even treat insomnia? Widely accepted ethical strategies of decision-making indicate that we should.

Therefore, in this study, antiproliferative characteristics of herbal and synthetic sedatives were examined in vitro in SNU-C4 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Apigenin (50% inhibition concentration, IC(50) = 1.8 +/- 0.5 microM) and diazepam (IC(50) = 7.0 +/- 0.5 microM) showed concentration-dependent inhibition of SNU-C4 cancer cell survival. Efficacy of cancer cell survival inhibition by apigenin and diazepam was much lower than that of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a known chemotherapeutic drug. However, 10(-6) M concentration of apigenin and diazepam potentiated 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity. In SNU-C4 cells, 10(-6) M concentrations of diazepam, flumazenil (Ro15-1788), Ro5-4864, or PK11195, all ligands for central- or peripheral-type benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, inhibited cell survival like the flavonoid apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) and fisetin (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone). Also like the plant flavonoids, treatment with 10(-6) M concentration of diazepam for 3 days hardly affect the peripheral-type BZD receptor (PBR) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and inhibited glucose utilization of SNU-C4 cells. Treatment with flavonoids or diazepam for 6 days upregulated PBR mRNA expression and cell cytotoxicity of SNU-C4 cells. Furthermore, treatment with 10(-6) M concentration of apigenin, a natural sedative material originating from traditional herbs, positively modulated BZD-induced antiproliferative cytotoxicity in SNU-C4 cells. Overall, the in vitro antiproliferative activity on SNU-C4 cancer cells of herbal sedatives, such as apigenin, plus additive enhancement of synthetic BZD- and 5-FU-induced antiproliferative activities, were shown. In conclusion, this study provides experimental basis for advanced trial in the future.", 
    "213": "(11)C-PK11195 is a radiopharmaceutical for in vivo assessment of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) activity using PET. We sought to clarify the metabolic fate of (11)C-PK11195 in a test-retest setting using radio-HPLC in comparison with radio-TLC, and the whole-body distribution in humans.", 
    "214": "In order to evaluate the reproducibility of radio-HPLC metabolite analyses, ten patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent two successive (11)C-PK11195 examinations on separate days. For comparison of different analytical methods, plasma samples from seven patients were also analysed by radio-TLC. In addition, we evaluated the whole-body distribution of (11)C-PK11195 and its uptake in the brain.", 
    "215": "The level of unmetabolized (11)C-PK11195 decreased slowly from 96.3 +/- 1.6% (mean+/-SD) at 5 min to 62.7 +/- 8.3% at 40 min after injection. Large individual variation was observed in the amount of plasma (11)C-PK11195 radiometabolites. The whole-body distribution of (11)C-PK11195 showed the highest radioactivity levels in urinary bladder, adrenal gland, liver, salivary glands, heart, kidneys, and vertebral column. In addition, the hip bone and breast bone were clearly visualized by PET. In patients with AD, (11)C-PK11195 uptake in the brain was the highest in the basal ganglia and thalamus, followed by the cortical grey matter regions and the cerebellum. Low (11)C-PK11195 uptake was observed in the white matter.", 
    "216": "Our results indicate that (11)C-PK11195 is eliminated both through the renal and hepatobiliary systems. Careful analysis of plasma metabolites is required to determine the accurate arterial input function for quantitative PET measurement.", 
    "217": "The case is reported of a female patient with attack-like neuropathic pain following lower arm injury with repeated respiratory depression and unconsciousness even after several administrations of sufficiently dosed analgetics for suppression of the attacks. Readers are encouraged to make their own diagnosis on the basis of the clinical findings and to discuss the case online (http://www.blogs.springer.com/DerSchmerz). The discussion and the solution will be published in the next issue."
