There were significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms experienced amongst people receiving chlorpromazine (2 RCTs, N = 298; RR 34.47, 95% CI 4.79 to 248.30,very low quality evidence). Quality of life ratings using the general quality of life interview (GQOLI) - physical health subscale were more favourable with people receiving olanzapine (1 RCT, N = 61; MD -10.10, 95% CI -13.93 to -6.27, very low quality evidence). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early (3 RCTs, N = 139; RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.40, very low quality evidence). 2.

    "15": "Opioid antagonists (eg, naltrexone) and positive modulators of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (eg, alprazolam) each modestly attenuate the abuse-related effects of stimulants. A previous study demonstrated that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam attenuated a greater number of the subject-rated effects of D-amphetamine than the constituent drugs alone. This study tested the hypothesis that maintenance on the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam XR would attenuate the reinforcing and \"positive\" subject-rated effects of methamphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone.Eight non-treatment-seeking, stimulant-using individuals completed a placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind inpatient protocol. Participants were maintained on naltrexone (0 and 50 mg), alprazolam XR (0 and 1 mg), and the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam XR (50 mg and 1 mg, respectively) for 6 to 7 days. Under each maintenance condition, participants sampled intranasal doses of methamphetamine (0, 10, and 30 mg), and were then offered the opportunity to work for the sampled dose on a modified progressive-ratio procedure. Subject-rated drug effect questionnaires, psychomotor, and physiology assessments were collected.Intranasal methamphetamine functioned as a reinforcer and produced prototypical stimulant-like \"positive\" subject-rated and physiological effects. Maintenance on naltrexone significantly decreased the reinforcing, but not subject-rated drug effects of 10-mg methamphetamine. Alprazolam XR and the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam XR did not impact methamphetamine self-administration or subject-rated drug effects. The results support the continued evaluation of naltrexone for methamphetamine dependence, as well as the identification of other drugs that enhance its ability to reduce drug-taking behavior.", 
    "16": "Benzodiazepine drugs are controversial because of safety and abuse liability concerns, although they have clinically relevant pharmacological differences. The current article reviews studies pertaining to the pharmacology, safety, and abuse liability of oxazepam. Compared to other benzodiazepine drugs, oxazepam has a favorable safety and abuse liability profile, which may be related to its pharmacology. Oxazepam is more slowly absorbed and enters the brain more slowly than other benzodiazepine drugs; it does not have active metabolites and does not accumulate with chronic dosing; its metabolism is not affected by age or by mild/moderate liver disease; and it is not prone to drug-drug interactions. Oxazepam also binds to the translocator protein, which stimulates the synthesis of neurosteroids, and this effect may contribute to its reduced abuse liability.",

Physical examination revealed the presence of a gluteal abscess in right pelvic limb with discoloration, as well as peri-lesional cellulitis and crepitus that stretches across the back of the limb. Fasciotomy was performed with debridement of necrotic tissue. Progression was torpid with crackling in abdomen. Computed tomography showed free air in the cavity, and on being surgically explored was found to be complicated diverticular disease.", 
    "27": "It is unusual for complicated diverticular disease to present with symptoms extra-peritoneal (< 2%) and even more so that a diverticulitis is due to necrotising fasciitis (< 1%). The absence of peritoneal manifestations delayed the timely diagnosis, which was evident with the crackling of the abdomen and abdominal computed tomography scan showing the parietal gaseous process.",

    "29": "The liver is the major organ of importance to determine drug dispositions in the body, thus the development of hepatocyte culture systems is of great scientific and practical interests to provide reliable and predictable models for in vitro drug screening. In the current study, to address the challenges of a rapid function loss of primary hepatocytes, the coculture of hepatocytes with fibroblasts and endothelial cells (Hep-Fib-EC) was established on micropatterned fibrous scaffolds. Liver-specific functions, such as the albumin secretion and urea synthesis, were well maintained in the coculture system, accompanied by a rapid formation of multicellular hepatocyte spheroids. The activities of phase I (CYP3A11 and CYP2C9) and phase II enzymes indicated a gradual increase for cocultured hepatocytes, and a maximum level was achieved after 5 days and maintained throughout 15 days of culture. The metabolism testing on model drugs indicated that the scaled clearance rates for hepatocytes in the Hep-Fib-EC coculture system were significantly higher than those of other culture methods, and a linear regression analysis indicated good correlations between the observed data of rats and in vitro predicted values during 15 days of culture. In addition, the enzyme activities and drug clearance rates of hepatocytes in the Hep-Fib-EC coculture model experienced sensitive responsiveness to the inducers and inhibitors of metabolizing enzymes. These results demonstrated the feasibility of micropatterned coculture of hepatocytes as a potential in vitro testing model for the prediction of in vivo drug metabolism.",

In addition, comparison with Petri dishes showed higher levels of CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6 related genes at the end of culture. Functional assays illustrated a higher urea and albumin production over the period of culture in biochips. Bioreactor drug metabolism (midazolam and phenacetin) was not superior to the Petri dish after 2\u2009days of culture. The CYP3A4 midazolam metabolism was maintained in biochips after 13\u2009days of culture, whereas it was almost undetectable in Petri dishes. This led to a 5000-fold higher value of the metabolic ratio in the biochips. CYP1A2 phenacetin metabolism was found to be higher in biochips after 5, 9 and 13\u2009days of culture. Thus, a 100-fold higher metabolic ratio of APAP in biochips was measured after 13\u2009days of perfusion.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is frequently underdiagnosed and therefore undertreated, which can lead to permanent neuronal damage resulting in disability or death. Despite the frequent occurrence and morbidity associated with status epilepticus, this topic has received little attention within the literature. A systematic approach to treatment should start with management of airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by administration of benzodiazepines and intravenous antiepileptic drugs, and rapid escalation of therapy to prevent morbidity and mortality.

Sedation can alleviate pain and discomfort, provide protection from stressful or harmful events, prevent anxiety and promote sleep. Various sedative agents are available for use in ICUs. In the UK, the most commonly used sedatives are propofol (Diprivan(\u00ae), AstraZeneca), benzodiazepines [e.g. midazolam (Hypnovel(\u00ae), Roche) and lorazepam (Ativan(\u00ae), Pfizer)] and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists [e.g. dexmedetomidine (Dexdor(\u00ae), Orion Corporation) and clonidine (Catapres(\u00ae), Boehringer Ingelheim)]. Sedative agents vary in onset/duration of effects and in their side effects. The pattern of sedation of alpha-2 agonists is quite different from that of other sedatives in that patients can be aroused readily and their cognitive performance on psychometric tests is usually preserved. Moreover, respiratory depression is less frequent after alpha-2 agonists than after other sedative agents.",

    "63": "Glufosinate-ammonium (GLA), the active component of a widely used herbicide, induces convulsions in rodents and humans. In mouse, intraperitoneal treatment with 75\u2009mg/kg GLA generates repetitive tonic-clonic seizures associated with 100% mortality within 72\u2009h after treatment. In this context, we characterized GLA-induced seizures, their histological consequences and the effectiveness of diazepam treatment. Epileptic discharges on electroencephalographic recordings appeared simultaneously in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. Diazepam treatment at 6\u2009h immediately stopped the seizures and prevented animal death. However, intermittent seizures were recorded on electroencephalogram from 6\u2009h after diazepam treatment until 24\u2009h, but had disappeared after 15 days. In our model, neuronal activation (c-Fos immunohistochemistry) was observed 6\u2009h after GLA exposure in the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA3, amygdala, piriform and entorhinal cortices, indicating the activation of the limbic system. In these structures, Fluoro-Jade C and Cresyl violet staining did not show neuronal suffering. However, astroglial activation was clearly observed at 24\u2009h and 15 days after GLA treatment in the amygdala, piriform and entorhinal cortices by PCR quantitative, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Concomitantly, glutamine synthetase mRNA expression (PCR quantitative), protein expression (western blot) and enzymatic activity were upregulated. In conclusion, our study suggests that GLA-induced seizures: (a) involved limbic structures and (b) induced astrocytosis without neuronal degeneration as an evidence of a reactive astrocyte beneficial effect for neuronal protection.",

Approximately half of the available data on the M/P ratio, RID, and infant drug plasma levels included olanzapine. Relatively adequate reports suggest that olanzapine has low RID values. Limited reports suggest low RID values for quetiapine and ziprasidone, moderate RID values for risperidone/paliperidone and aripiprazole, and high RID values for amisulpride. Antipsychotic levels were undetectable in the plasma of most of the exposed infants. Other than clozapine, adverse events were rarely reported in infants exposed to SGAs.",

Given preclinical studies revealing the role of histamine H1 receptor in human eating behavior, and the potential of olanzapine to block with this system, we hypothesized that histamine H1 receptor agonists may be beneficial in reducing antipsychotic-associated weight gain. In the present study, 36 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and treated with olanzapine were randomized to betahistine (48 mg/d) or matching placebo for 16 weeks. Study outcomes were change in body weight from baseline and effect on antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine. The patients in the betahistine group had less weight gain (-1.95 kg) compared with placebo group (5.6 + 5.5 kg vs 6.9 + 5.6 kg, respectively). Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Questionnaire showed improvement within each group and that subjects treated with betahistine enjoyed an improvement (reduction) by a mean of 35.7 points, higher when compared with placebo subjects who had a reduction of 26.6 points (P = 0.233). An almost equal amount of subjects in both groups experienced adverse effects during the course of this study (87.5% of betahistine vs 85.0% of placebo-treated subjects). Overall, there were no clinically marked differences in safety signals between both groups. A larger study addressing the weaknesses of this pilot study is warranted.",

    "86": "Use of second generation antipsychotics in England and Wales has increased in recent years whilst prescription of first generation antipsychotics has decreased.", 
    "87": "To evaluate the impact of this change and of the withdrawal of thioridazine in 2000 on antipsychotic-related fatal poisoning, we reviewed all such deaths in England and Wales 1993-2013 recorded on the Office for National Statistics drug poisoning deaths database. We also reviewed antipsychotic prescribing in the community, England and Wales, 2001-2013. Use of routine mortality data: When an antipsychotic was recorded with other drug(s), the death certificate does not normally say if the antipsychotic caused the death rather than the other substance(s). A second consideration concerns intent. A record of \"undetermined intent\" is likely to have been intentional self-poisoning, the evidence being insufficient to be certain that the individual intended to kill. A record of drug abuse/dependence, on the other hand, is likely to have been associated with an unintentional death. Accuracy of the diagnosis of poisoning: When investigating a death in someone prescribed antipsychotics, toxicological analysis of biological samples collected post-mortem is usually performed. However, prolonged attempts at resuscitation, or diffusion from tissues into blood as autolysis proceeds, may serve to alter the composition of blood sampled after death from that circulating at death. With chlorpromazine and with olanzapine a further factor is that these compounds are notoriously unstable in post-mortem blood. Deaths from antipsychotics: There were 1544 antipsychotic-related poisoning deaths. Deaths in males (N\u2009=\u2009948) were almost twice those in females. For most antipsychotics, the proportion of deaths in which a specific antipsychotic featured either alone, or only with alcohol was 30-40%, but for clozapine (193 deaths) such mentions totalled 66%. For clozapine, the proportion of deaths attributed to either intentional self-harm, or undetermined intent was 44%, but for all other drugs except haloperidol (20 deaths) the proportion was 56% or more. The annual number of antipsychotic-related deaths increased from some 55 per year (1.0 per million population) between 1993 and 1998 to 74 (1.5 per million population) in 2000, and then after falling slightly in 2002 increased steadily to reach 109 (1.9 per million population) in 2013. Intent: The annual number of intentional and unascertained intent poisoning deaths remained relatively constant throughout the study period (1993: 35 deaths, 2013: 38 deaths) hence the increase in antipsychotic-related deaths since 2002 was almost entirely in unintentional poisoning involving second generation antipsychotics. Clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine were the second generation antipsychotics mentioned most frequently in unintentional poisonings (99, 136, and 99 deaths, respectively). Mentions of diamorphine/morphine and methadone (67 and 99 deaths, respectively) together with an antipsychotic were mainly (84 and 90%, respectively) in either unintentional or drug abuse-related deaths. Deaths and community prescriptions: Deaths involving antipsychotics (10 or more deaths) were in the range 11.3-17.1 deaths per million community prescriptions in England and Wales, 2001-2013. Almost all (96%) such deaths now involve second generation antipsychotics. This is keeping with the increase in annual numbers of prescriptions of these drugs overall (<1 million in 2000, 7 million in 2013), largely driven by increases in prescriptions for olanzapine and quetiapine. In contrast, deaths involving thioridazine declined markedly (from 40 in 2000 to 10 in 2003-2013) in line with the fall in prescriptions for thioridazine from 2001.", 
    "88": "The removal of thioridazine has had no apparent effect on the incidence of antipsychotic-related fatal poisoning in England and Wales. That such deaths have increased steadily since 2001 is in large part attributable to an increase in unintentional deaths related to (i) clozapine, and (ii) co-exposure to opioids, principally diamorphine and methadone.",

This prevalence was 10.6\u00a0% for anxiolytic benzodiazepines, and 6.1\u00a0% for hypnotic benzodiazepines. Approximately half of the benzodiazepine users (48.1\u00a0%) were at increased risk for benzodiazepine ADRs; this proportion increased with age. Drug-drug interactions represented the most prevalent condition (39.3\u00a0% of benzodiazepine users). The drugs most frequently involved were opioids: analgesics (15.9\u00a0%) and antitussives (6.8\u00a0%). Overall, 11.3\u00a0% of benzodiazepine users had comorbidities at increased risk for adverse respiratory effects (13.9\u00a0% in those aged 65-79), and 7.0\u00a0% comorbidities at increased risk for falls or fractures (13.4\u00a0% in those aged \u226580).", 
    "92": "This study found that benzodiazepine use remained high in France, and that roughly half of the users presented with comorbidities and concurrent medications increasing the risk of ADRs. These findings are of concern, given that benzodiazepines are frequently used, and especially among the elderly.", 
    "93": "Childhood stress and trauma are associated with substance use disorders in adulthood, but the neurological changes that confer increased vulnerability are largely unknown. In this study, maternal separation (MS) stress, restricted to the pre-weaning period, was used as a model to study mechanisms of protracted effects of childhood stress/traumatic experiences on binge drinking and impulsivity. Using an operant self-administration model of binge drinking and a delay discounting assay to measure impulsive-like behavior, we report that early life stress due to MS facilitated acquisition of binge drinking and impulsivity during adulthood in rats. Previous studies have shown heightened levels of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) after MS, and here, we add that MS increased expression levels of GABA(A) \u03b12 subunit in central stress circuits. To investigate the precise role of these circuits in regulating impulsivity and binge drinking, the CRF1 receptor antagonist antalarmin and the novel GABA(A) \u03b12 subunit ligand 3-PBC were infused into the central amygdala (CeA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Antalarmin and 3-PBC at each site markedly reduced impulsivity and produced profound reductions on binge-motivated alcohol drinking, without altering responding for sucrose. Furthermore, whole-cell patch-clamp studies showed that low concentrations of 3-PBC directly reversed the effect of relatively high concentrations of ethanol on \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32 GABA(A) receptors, by a benzodiazepine site-independent mechanism. Together, our data provide strong evidence that maternal separation, i.e. early life stress, is a risk factor for binge drinking, and is linked to impulsivity, another key risk factor for excessive alcohol drinking. We further show that pharmacological manipulation of CRF and GABA receptor signaling is effective to reverse binge drinking and impulsive-like behavior in MS rats. These results provide novel insights into the role of the brain stress systems in the development of impulsivity and excessive alcohol consumption.", 
    "94": "An analytical artifact peak appearing to be an impurity was observed intermittently among several laboratories performing HPLC analyses of olanzapine drug substance and formulation samples. The artifact peak was identified as Cu(I) that was formed from the reaction of trace amounts of Cu(II) with olanzapine in the sample solution. Unlike Cu(II), Cu(I) was retained under the ion-pairing HPLC conditions used for analysis. A reaction mechanism was postulated whereby Cu(II) present in the sample solution oxidizes olanzapine to a radical-cation, resulting in formation of Cu(I) and three oxidation products of olanzapine including a previously unknown oxidation product that was identified as hydroxy-olanzapine. Acetonitrile in the sample solution was necessary for the reaction to occur. As little as 100 ppb Cu(II) in the sample solution produced a Cu(I) peak, that by peak area, corresponded to about 0.1% relative to the olanzapine peak. The hydroxy-olanzapine oxidation product was also detectable, but the relative peak area was much smaller. To prevent formation of the Cu(I) artifact peak, EDTA was added to the sample solvent to complex any trace Cu(II) that might be present. The addition of EDTA was shown to prevent Cu(I) formation when Cu(II) was present at levels of 4ppm in the sample solution.",

    "98": "Anxiety helps us anticipate and assess potential danger in ambiguous situations [1-3]; however, the anxiety disorders are the most prevalent class of psychiatric illness [4-6]. Emotional states are shared between humans and other animals [7], as observed by behavioral manifestations [8], physiological responses [9], and gene conservation [10]. Anxiety research makes wide use of three rodent behavioral assays-elevated plus maze, open field, and light/dark box-that present a choice between sheltered and exposed regions [11]. Exposure avoidance in anxiety-related defense behaviors was confirmed to be a correlate of rodent anxiety by treatment with known anxiety-altering agents [12-14] and is now used to characterize anxiety systems. Modeling anxiety with a small neurogenetic animal would further aid the elucidation of its neuronal and molecular bases. Drosophila neurogenetics research has elucidated the mechanisms of fundamental behaviors and implicated genes that are often orthologous across species. In an enclosed arena, flies stay close to the walls during spontaneous locomotion [15, 16], a behavior proposed to be related to anxiety [17]. We tested this hypothesis with manipulations of the GABA receptor, serotonin signaling, and stress. The effects of these interventions were strikingly concordant with rodent anxiety, verifying that these behaviors report on an anxiety-like state. Application of this method was able to identify several new fly anxiety genes. The presence of conserved neurogenetic pathways in the insect brain identifies Drosophila as an attractive genetic model for the study of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, complementing existing rodent systems.",

    "103": "Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. NPC is characterised by storage of multiple lipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, resulting in cellular and organ system dysfunction. The underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to the range of clinical presentations in NPC are not fully understood. While evaluating potential small molecule therapies in Npc1-/- mice, we observed a consistent pattern of toxicity associated with drugs metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system, suggesting a potential drug metabolism defect in NPC1 disease. Investigation of the P450 system in the context of NPC1 dysfunction revealed significant changes in the gene expression of many P450 associated genes across the full lifespan of Npc1-/- mice, decreased activity of cytochrome P450 reductase, and a global decrease of multiple cytochrome P450 catalysed dealkylation reactions. In vivo drug metabolism studies using a prototypic P450 metabolised drug, midazolam, confirmed dysfunction in drug clearance in the Npc1-/- mouse. Expression of the Phase II enzyme uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) was also significantly reduced in Npc1-/- mice. Interestingly, reduced activity within the P450 system was also observed in heterozygous Npc1+/- mice. The reduced activity of P450 enzymes may be the result of bile acid deficiency/imbalance in Npc1-/- mice, as bile acid treatment significantly rescued P450 enzyme activity in Npc1-/- mice and has the potential to be an adjunctive therapy for NPC disease patients. The dysfunction in the cytochrome P450 system were recapitulated in the NPC1 feline model. Additionally, we present the first evidence that there are alterations in the P450 system in NPC1 patients.",

However, laws against the use of drugs while driving are not yet established in Korea. In order to investigate the type and frequency of drugs used by drivers in Korea, we analyzed controlled and non-controlled drugs in alcohol-positive blood samples. Total 275 blood samples were taken from Korean drivers, which were positive in roadside alcohol testing. The following analyses were performed: blood alcohol concentrations by GC; screening for controlled drugs by immunoassay and confirmation for positive samples by GC-MS. For the detection of DUID related drugs in blood samples, a total of 49 drugs were selected and were examined by GC-MS. For a rapid detection of these drugs, an automated identification software called \"DrugMan\" was used. Concentrations of alcohol in 275 blood samples ranged from 0.011 to 0.249% (average 0.119%). Six specimens showed positive results by immunoassay: one methamphetamine and five benzodiazepines I. By GC-MS confirmation, only benzodiazepines in four cases were identified, while methamphetamine and benzodiazepine in two cases were not detected from the presumptive positive blood samples. Using DrugMan, four drugs were detected; chlorpheniramine (5)*, diazepam (4), dextromethorphan (1) and doxylamine (1). In addition, ibuprofen (1), lidocaine (1) and topiramate (1) were also detected as general drugs in blood samples ('*' indicates frequency). The frequency of drug abuse by Korean drivers was relatively low and a total 14 cases were positive in 275 blood samples with a ratio of 5%. However it is necessary to analyze more samples including alcohol negative blood, and to expand the range of drug lists to get the detailed information.", 
    "105": "Structurally different and functionally diverse natural compounds - antitumour agents pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines, bacterial hormone hormaomycin, and lincosamide antibiotic lincomycin - share a common building unit, 4-alkyl-L-proline derivative (APD). APDs arise from L-tyrosine through a special biosynthetic pathway. Its generally accepted scheme, however, did not comply with current state of knowledge. Based on gene inactivation experiments and in vitro functional tests with recombinant enzymes, we designed a new APD biosynthetic scheme for the model of lincomycin biosynthesis. In the new scheme at least one characteristic in each of five final biosynthetic steps has been changed: the order of reactions, assignment of enzymes and/or reaction mechanisms. First, we demonstrate that LmbW methylates a different substrate than previously assumed. Second, we propose a unique reaction mechanism for the next step, in which a putative \u03b3-glutamyltransferase LmbA indirectly cleaves off the oxalyl residue by transient attachment of glutamate to LmbW product. This unprecedented mechanism would represent the first example of the C-C bond cleavage catalyzed by a \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, i.e., an enzyme that appears unsuitable for such activity. Finally, the inactivation experiments show that LmbX is an isomerase indicating that it transforms its substrate into a compound suitable for reduction by LmbY, thereby facilitating its subsequent complete conversion to APD 4-propyl-L-proline. Elucidation of the APD biosynthesis has long time resisted mainly due to the apparent absence of relevant C-C bond cleaving enzymatic activity. Our proposal aims to unblock this situation not only for lincomycin biosynthesis, but generally for all above mentioned groups of bioactive natural products with biotechnological potential.",

Little is, however, known about how these drugs are excreted in oral fluid. It has been claimed that the parent drugs are more likely to be detected in oral fluid than the 7-amino metabolites. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the parent drugs or the 7-amino metabolites of the nitrobenzodiazepines were most frequently detected in authentic oral fluid samples. Oral fluid samples were collected from patients undergoing opioid maintenance treatment. Cases where clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam and/or their metabolites were detected were included. The samples were collected using the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device. A cutoff concentration of 1 nM (\u223c0.3 ng/mL) in oral fluid-buffer mixture was applied for all the substances. A total of 1,001 oral fluid samples were positive for clonazepam and/or 7-aminoclonazepam; both substances were detected in 707 samples, only the parent drug in 64 cases and only the metabolite in 230 cases. For nitrazepam, both substances were detected in 139 samples; only the parent drug in 16 cases and only the metabolite in 56 cases. Flunitrazepam only was not detected in any sample; both substances were detected in one of these cases, and only the metabolite in three cases. This study revealed that 7-amino metabolites were more likely to be detected in oral fluid than the parent drugs.",

In this study, the use of high-yield manufacture of fiber-based dispersion is explored as an alternative approach to monolith production methods. A temperature-controlled solvent-free centrifugal spinning process was used to produce sucrose-based microfibers containing the poorly water-soluble drugs olanzapine and piroxicam (both BCS Class II); these were successfully incorporated into the microfibers and the basic characteristics of fiber diameter, glassy behavior, drug loading capacity and drug-sucrose interaction assessment were measured. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that bead-free drug-loaded microfibers with homogenous morphology and diameter in the range of a few micrometers were prepared using our process. Differential scanning calorimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that both drug and carrier were present in the amorphous state in the microfibers, although in the case of piroxicam-loaded microfibers, the presence of small amounts of crystalline drug was observed under polarized light microscopy and in Fourier transform infrared spectra. Drug dissolution performance was evaluated under both sink and non-sink conditions and was found to be significantly enhanced compared to the corresponding crystalline physical mixtures and pure drugs, with evidence of supersaturation behavior noted under non-sink conditions. This study has demonstrated that microfiber-based dispersions may be manufactured by the centrifugal spinning process and may possess characteristics that are favorable for the enhanced dissolution and oral absorption of drugs.",

This study evaluated the cardiovascular, respiratory, and anesthetic effects of dexmedetomidine (40 \u03bcg/kg) with S-ketamine (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) with S-ketamine (5 mg/kg) in 12 specimens of oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) at Quinzinho de Barros Municipal Zoo Park in Sorocaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, between January and March 2010. Each animal underwent both protocols, totaling 24 anesthetic procedures. The dexmedetomidine-S-ketamine group (DK) showed a decrease in heart rate compared to initial values and significantly lower heart rate and oxyhemoglobin saturation values compared to Midazolam-S-Ketamine Group (MK). Four animals in DK had episodes of sinus pauses. Systemic blood pressure, respiratory frequency, and rectal temperature showed no significant differences between groups. The dexmedetomidine-S-ketamine group showed a greater degree of muscle relaxation and allowed for more thorough and longer oral evaluations. The dexmedetomidine-S-ketamine group had a shorter period of recumbency, longer period to return of muscle tone, and shorter recovery time. Two animals in MK did not reach recumbency. The dexmedetomidine-S-ketamine group had better qualities of induction and recovery. It may be concluded that both protocols can be safely used in oncillas. Midazolam-S-ketamine promotes effective chemical restraint for quick and minimally invasive procedures and dexmedetomidine-S-ketamine promotes effective chemical restraint for prolonged and more invasive procedures.", 
    "114": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity can be assessed using a 'cocktail' phenotyping approach. Recently, we have developed a cocktail (Geneva cocktail) which combines the use of low-dose probes with a low-invasiveness dried blood spots (DBS) sampling technique and a single analytical method for the phenotyping of six major CYP isoforms. We have previously demonstrated that modulation of CYP activity after pre-treatment with CYP inhibitors/inducer could be reliably predicted using Geneva cocktail. To further validate this cocktail, in this study, we have verified whether probe drugs contained in the latter cause mutual drug-drug interactions. In a randomized, four-way, Latin-square crossover study, 30 healthy volunteers received low-dose caffeine, flurbiprofen, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and midazolam (a previously validated combination with no mutual drug-drug interactions); fexofenadine alone; bupropion alone; or all seven drugs simultaneously (Geneva cocktail). Pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe drugs and their metabolites were determined in DBS samples using both conventional micropipette sampling and new microfluidic device allowing for self-sampling. The 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratios of AUC metabolite/AUC probe for CYP probes administered alone or within Geneva cocktail fell within the 0.8-1.25 bioequivalence range indicating the absence of pharmacokinetic interaction. The same result was observed for the chosen phenotyping indices, that is metabolic ratios at 2 hr (CYP1A2, CYP3A) or 3 hr (CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) post-cocktail administration. DBS sampling could successfully be performed using a new microfluidic device. In conclusion, Geneva cocktail combined with an innovative DBS sampling device can be used routinely as a test for simultaneous CYP phenotyping.",

Non-adherence to therapy is a very common and severe problem in these patients, which can be improved by prescribing depot injectable or implant formulations. The purpose of this study was to develop PNA microgels based in situ gelling system for sustained release of olanzapine. PNA [poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)] microgels were prepared using a previously developed method employing emulsion polymerization technique, applying one of the optimized formulations. Olanzapine loaded PNA microgels were characterized by viscosity measurements, cytotoxicity assay and TEM analysis. In vitro release of olanzapine from PNA microgels was determined on different pH and temperature range. In vivo studies were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats with average weight of 315 g (n = 6). Olanzapine loaded PNA microgels were successfully prepared with drug loading efficiency of 2.14 \u00b1 0.52%. The fluid like viscosity of microgels formulation at lower pH value (pH 5.0) and room as well as body temperature made it favorable for injection form. In vitro release was characterized by a high initial burst release up to 38.6% of the drug release within 2 h. In vivo release data also indicated similar initial high burst release that might indicate toxicity when administered in injectable dosage form but subcutaneous injection of PNA microgels proved fruitful results as this initial burst release followed a sustained release for 72 h. Hence, PNA microgels can be formulated for short term depot injection, which can potentially provide the release of olanzapine for 72 h.", 
    "116": "Although the anticonvulsant activity of 3-hydroxy-3-ethyl-3-phenylproionamide (HEPP) is well-known, its use is limited by the pharmacotoxicological profile. We herein tested its fluorinated and chlorinated derivatives (F-HEPP and Cl-HEPP) with two seizure models, maximal electroshock seizures (MES), and intraperitoneal pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) administration. Neurotoxicity was examined via the rotarod test. With in silico methods, binding was probed on possible protein targets-GABAA receptors and the sodium channel Nav1.2. The median effective doses (ED50) of HEPP, F-HEPP, and Cl-HEPP in the MES seizure model were 129.6, 87.1, and 62.0\u2009mg/kg, respectively, and 66.4, 43.5, and in the PTZ seizure model 43.5\u2009mg/kg. The HEPP-induced neurotoxic effect, which occurred at twice the ED50 against MES (p < 0.05), did not occur with F-HEPP or Cl-HEPP. Docking studies revealed that all tested ligands bound to GABAA receptors on a site near to the benzodiazepine binding site. However, on the sodium channel open pore Nav1.2, R-HEPP had interactions similar to those reported for phenytoin, while its enantiomer and the ligands F-HEPP and Cl-HEPP reached a site that could disrupt the passage of sodium. Our results show that, as anticonvulsant agents, parahalogen substituted compounds have an advantageous pharmacotoxicological profile compared to their precursor.",

We report a case of stress cardiomyopathy that developed during severe alcohol withdrawal successfully treated with dexmedetomidine. The case involves a 53-year-old man with a significant history of alcohol abuse who presented to a teaching hospital with new-onset seizures. His symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal were initially treated with benzodiazepines, but the patient later developed hypotension, and stress cardiomyopathy was suspected based on ECG and echocardiographic findings. Adjunctive treatment with the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, was initiated to curtail excessive sympathetic outflow of the withdrawal syndrome, thereby targeting the presumed pathophysiology of the cardiomyopathy. Significant clinical improvement was observed within one day of initiation of dexmedetomidine. These findings are consistent with other reports suggesting that sympathetic dysregulation during alcohol withdrawal produces ideal pathobiology for stress cardiomyopathy and leads to ventricular arrhythmogenicity. Stress cardiomyopathy should be recognized as a complication of alcohol withdrawal that significantly increases cardiac-related mortality. By helping to correct autonomic dysregulation of the withdrawal syndrome, dexmedetomidine may be useful in the treatment of stress-induced cardiomyopathy.",

Moreover, important effects on neurosteroidogenesis and oxytocin release are wielded. GHB acts mainly via a bidirectional effect on GABAB receptors (GABABR; subunits GABAB1 and GABAB2), depending on the subunit of the GIRK (G-protein-dependent ion inwardly rectifying potassium) channel involved, and an indirect effect of the cortical and limbic inputs outside the nucleus accumbens. GHB also activates a specific GHB receptor and \u03b21-subunits of \u03b14-GABAAR. Reversing this complex interaction of neurobiological mechanisms by the abrupt cessation of GHB use results in a withdrawal syndrome with a diversity of symptoms of different intensity, depending on the pattern of GHB abuse.",

BDZ are typically used in drug-facilitated crimes (DFC) for their accessibility and synergistic effects with alcohol. Specimens collected on the crime scene must be rapidly analyzed to prove the crime, though, in most cases, a very small amount is available. Off-line MEPS extraction of diluted grappa samples proved to be an efficient and reliable method for the recovery of the selected compounds. Requiring a very small amount of extraction solvents, MEPS is an environment-friendly technique. LC separation with UV detection was used as the analytical technique because it is simple, robust, relatively economic and easy-to-find in most laboratories. The method was validated in terms of precision, accuracy and recovery. Limits of detection and quantitation were in the range of 0.5-2ng/\u03bcL. Linearity (R(2)) spanned from 0.9994 and 1.0000.

Clinical management was similar for both intervals, as well as prevalence of alcohol withdrawal syndrome versus total adult hospital admissions and comorbid conditions. Overall, respiratory failure (53 versus 39%), seizures (36 versus 18%), and pneumonia (51 versus 38%) were less frequent during Interval 2 (all p < .05), with lower benzodiazedpine basal dose requirements for those given adjunctive therapy. However, if instances of pneumonia or respiratory failure related to seizures prior to intensive care unit admission are excluded, the prevalence of these complications was similar (p = ns) for Interval 1 and Interval 2. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were not altered by adjunctive therapy, which was typically employed for more severely affected patients. High intensity sedation with adjunctive drugs led to few cardiovascular adverse events and may have facilitated management, but did not alter intensive care unit course of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "127": "Olanzapine (OLZ) is a typical anti-psychotic drug, which is highly lipophilic in nature, belongs to Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class II category. Though OLZ is an effective agent in the treatment of Schizophrenia, but it exhibits poor bioavailability (57%) due to extensive first-pass metabolism resulted in high dose is required to achieve therapeutic concentration in brain. Emerging evidences are indicating that high dose administration of OLZ may cause Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in the psychotic patients. Hence, the present study is designed to develop Olanzapine solid lipid (OLZ-SLNs) using minimal dose of OLZ thereby enhancing the brain efficacy as well as to reduce the side effects associated with OLZ. OLZ-SLNs have been prepared by \"solvent diffusion method\" using lipids, such as glyceryl monostearate (GMS), tripalmitin (TP), Tween 80, and Stearyl amine as positive charge inducer. The prepared OLZ-SLNs were subjected to particle size analysis, zeta potential, and poly dispersity index measurement by using Malvern Zetasizer. Pharmacokinetics assessments of OLZ-SLNs were carried in conscious male Wistar rats through intravenous administration. Results have shown that average particle size and zeta potential of SLNs of GMS and TP were ranged from 165.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 to 110.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 and 35.29\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 and 66.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2009mV, respectively. Relative bioavailability of OLZ in the brain was increased up to 23-fold and clearance was decreased when OLZ-SLNs while administrated intravenously. The area under the curve (AUC) and mean residence time (MRT) of OLZ-SLNs in brain were higher than OLZ suspension. These results indicate that SLNs are a promising drug delivery for OLZ. It may be an effective tool to enhance the bioavailability of OLZ in the brain with less dose administration, which could reduce the EPS associated with OLZ.",

Yet, it remains a significant challenge to create a viable screening tool for multiple drug classes, owing to the lack of affinity of certain species for the SERS substrate and to the matrix interference in complex media. Here we report a protein tethering SERS approach, which blends plasmonic enhancement with facile drug binding, to engineer a rapid, label-free and versatile screening tool for narcotics. By exploiting the known binding attributes of human serum albumin, we determine the effective concentration of narcotics present in solution through differential enhancement of the spectral markers. In conjunction with chemometric methods, this approach not only enables unambiguous recognition of different drug classes, such as barbiturates, opiates, amphetamines and benzodiazepines, but also offers a lower limit of detection in comparison to direct SERS application. Through molecular docking simulations, we probe the mechanistic underpinnings of the protein tethering approach paving the way for narcotic detection in clinical samples in the near future.",

    "140": "Recent studies of reflex epileptic mechanisms in human epilepsy using advanced methods of neurophysiology and functional neuroimaging have contributed much to elucidate pathophysiological processes of seizure generation. Whereas in lesional focal epilepsies reflex mechanisms usually relate directly to the anatomical focus, in system epilepsies they have helped to define which functional anatomical systems serving physiological function are recruited by the ictogenic mechanisms. Reflex epileptic seizures can often be prevented by avoidance or modification of triggers or by prophylactic benzodiazepine administration. Surgical options apply to focal cases. According to restricted experiences with pharmacotherapy, without controlled studies and little information on new AEDs, reflex seizures in system epilepsies appear to respond best to valproic acid and in focal epilepsies, to carbamazepine.",

We conducted a case-control study in the public health service of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The participants were all patients being treated with antidepressants, who were diagnosed with major depression. Patients who received a combination of antidepressants and BDZs were classified as cases, and those who used only antidepressants, as controls. Data were obtained from a pharmacy database, medical records and interviews with the healthcare team. The association of predisposing factors for combined therapy was analysed using logistic regression analysis, and the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Of the 1355 users of antidepressants, 265 had major depression, of whom 138 were cases and 127 were controls. The factors associated with combined use were age older than 35 years (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.7), absence of comorbidities (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-4.1) and no use of other drugs (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3). Patients with combined use were more likely to exhibit inadequate prescribing, including inappropriate antidepressants (OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.2-9.9), inadequate dosages (OR 3.62, 95% CI 1.4-9.6) and/or a non-recommended duration (OR 66.6, 95% CI 18.4-240.7). The factors identified showed the groups most susceptible to combined use in this population, who in turn are more likely to receive inappropriate prescriptions.",

The aim of this study was to develop an LC-MS/MS-based targeted oral fluid screening technique that covers a broad range of basic and neutral drugs of abuse that can satisfy increased caseload while monitoring other compounds of interest for epidemiological purposes. By combining small sample volume, simple extraction procedure, rapid LC-MS/MS analysis and automated data processing, 40 drugs of abuse including amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine and major metabolites, opioids, cannabinoids and some designer stimulants were separated over 5\u00a0min (with an additional 0.5\u00a0min re-equilibration time). The analytes were detected using a Sciex\u00ae API 4500 Q-Trap LC-MS/MS system with positive ESI in MRM mode monitoring three transitions per analyte. The method was fully validated in accordance with international guidelines and also monitored carbon-13 isotopes of MDMA and MA to reduce detector saturation effects, allowing for confirmation of large concentrations of these compounds without the need for dilution or re-analysis. The described assay has been successfully used for analysis of oral fluid collected as part of law enforcement procedures at the roadside in Victoria, providing forensic results as well as epidemiological prevalence in the population tested. The fast and reliable detection of a broad range of drugs and subsequent automated data processing gives the opportunity for high throughput and fast turnaround times for forensic toxicology.",

There is no comprehensive review on the molecular signaling pathways of these active components. In this review, we investigated the molecular targets of bioactive Salvia diterpenes responsible for the treatment of nervous and cardiovascular diseases. The effects on different pathways, including apoptosis signaling, oxidative stress phenomena, the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques, and tau phosphorylation, have all been considered to be mechanisms of the anti-Alzheimer properties of Salvia diterpenes. Additionally, effects on the benzodiazepine and kappa opioid receptors and neuroprotective effects are noted as neuropharmacological properties of Salvia diterpenes, including tanshinone IIA, salvinorin A, cryptotanshinone, and miltirone. Tanshinone IIA, as the primary diterpene of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has beneficial activities in heart diseases because of its ability to scavenge free radicals and its effects on transcription factors, such as nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).

NPS intake is typically associated with the imbalance of a complex range of neurotransmitter pathways/receptors, namely: dopamine; cannabinoid/CB1; and 5-HT2A. The intake is almost invariably undetectable with standard screening tests. Hence, it may frequently occur that the acute management of NPS misusers will need to focus on decreasing levels of both self/outward-directed aggression and agitation.

    "211": "Patients with psychotic illnesses may exhibit agitated, threatening, or destructive behaviour that could be dangerous to themselves or others. Researchers have found that as many as 1 in 5 individuals admitted to acute psychiatric units may commit an act of violence while in hospital. Additional research suggests that patients with psychosis who have a history of violence or substance abuse may be at an increased risk of committing violence. To ensure a safe environment, clinical practice guidelines suggest that health care providers first use verbal de-escalation techniques to engage agitated patients. In some cases, however, verbal de-escalation may be ineffective, thereby necessitating the use of alternative management approaches. One such strategy is rapid tranquilization, the aim for which is to use psychotropic medications \u201cto calm/lightly sedate the service user, reduce the risk to self and/or others and achieve an optimal reduction in agitation and aggression.\u201d Ideally, medications for rapid tranquilization should have a rapid onset of action, result in few adverse effects, and have a short duration of action. Empirical evidence suggests that clinicians often prefer to use two major drug classes \u2013 benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, either alone or in combination \u2013 to manage agitated patients. Intramuscular (IM) injections of these drugs appear attractive as they may offer superior pharmacokinetic properties and more favourable clinical profiles versus their respective oral formulations. In 2010, a previous Rapid Response Report found six systematic reviews (SRs), one meta-analysis (MAs), three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one major clinical practice guideline (CPG), and five supplementary guideline sources. Based on the available literature, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines appeared to be effective in mediating the symptoms of agitation or aggression. Further, guidelines appeared to vary on the choice of drugs for rapid tranquilization, but they recommended using a combination of an IM antipsychotic (haloperidol) and an IM benzodiazepine (lorazepam) to effectively cope with agitated patients. The purpose of this Rapid Response report is to update the previous review to assess the extent to which there have been advances in the evidence informing the clinical efficacy of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines for rapid tranquilization of in-patients of mental facilities and emergency departments.",

We also included randomized trials that were not in systematic reviews. The quality of included studies was assessed, data were extracted, and results were summarized qualitatively based on the totality of the evidence.", 
    "215": "Of the 2,545 citations identified at the title and abstract level, a total of 156 publications were included. Most trials enrolled patients with pain symptoms of at least moderate intensity (e.g., >5 on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale for pain). Across interventions, pain intensity was the most commonly reported outcome, followed by back-specific function. When present, observed benefits for pain were generally in the small (5 to 10 points on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale or 0.5 to 1.0 points on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale) to moderate (10 to 20 points) range. Effects on function were generally smaller than effects on pain; in some cases, there were positive effects on pain but no effects on function, and fewer studies measured function than pain. Benefits were mostly measured at short-term followup. For acute low back pain, evidence suggested that NSAIDs (strength of evidence [SOE]: low to moderate), skeletal muscle relaxants (SOE: moderate), opioids (SOE: low), exercise (SOE: low), and superficial heat (SOE: moderate) are more effective than placebo, no intervention, or usual care, and that acetaminophen (SOE: low) and systemic corticosteroids (SOE: low) are no more effective than placebo. For chronic low back pain, effective therapies versus placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care, or wait list are NSAIDs, opioids, tramadol, duloxetine, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, and exercise (SOE: moderate) and benzodiazepines, psychological therapies, massage, yoga, tai chi, and low-level laser therapy (SOE: low); spinal manipulation was as effective as other active interventions (SOE: moderate). Few trials evaluated the effectiveness of treatments for radicular low back pain, but the available evidence found that benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, traction, and spinal manipulation were not effective or were associated with small effects (SOE: low). Relatively few trials directly compared the effectiveness of different medications or different nonpharmacological therapies, or compared pharmacological versus nonpharmacological therapies, and they generally found no clear differences in effects. Pharmacological therapies were associated with increased risk of adverse events versus placebo (SOE: low to moderate). Trials were not designed or powered to detect serious harms from pharmacological therapies. Although rates appeared to be low and there was not an increased risk of serious harms versus placebo, this does not rule out significant risk from some treatments. For nonpharmacological therapies, assessment of harms was suboptimal, but serious harms appeared to be rare (SOE: low).",

    "217": "Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a devastating complication when the blood supply is reflowed in ischemic organs. Gastrin has critical function in regulating acid secretion, proliferation, and differentiation in the gastric mucosa. We aimed to determine whether gastrin has an effect on intestinal I/R damage. Intestinal I/R injury was induced by 60-min occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery followed by 60-min reperfusion, and the rats were induced to be hypergastrinemic by pretreated with omeprazole or directly injected with gastrin. Some hypergastrinemic rats were injected with cholecystokinin-2 (CCK-2) receptor antagonist prior to I/R operation. After the animal surgery, the intestine was collected for histological analysis. Isolated intestinal epithelial cells or crypts were harvested for RNA and protein analysis. CCK-2 receptor expression, intestinal mucosal damage, cell apoptosis, and apoptotic protein caspase-3 activity were measured. We found that high gastrin in serum significantly reduced intestinal hemorrhage, alleviated extensive epithelial disruption, decreased disintegration of lamina propria, downregulated myeloperoxidase activity, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and caspase-3 activity, and lead to low mortality in response to I/R injury. On the contrary, CCK-2 receptor antagonist L365260 could markedly impair intestinal protection by gastrin on intestinal I/R. Severe edema of mucosal villi with severe intestinal crypt injury and numerous intestinal villi disintegrated were observed again in the hypergastrinemic rats with L365260. The survival in the hypergastrinemic rats after intestinal I/R injury was shortened by L365260. Finally, gastrin could remarkably upregulated intestinal CCK-2 receptor expression. Our data suggest that gastrin by omeprazole remarkably attenuated I/R induced intestinal injury by enhancing CCK-2 receptor expression and gastrin could be a potential mitigator for intestinal I/R damage in the clinical setting.",

    "222": "A series of imidazo[1,5-a]quinoline derivatives was designed and synthesized as central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) ligands. Most of the compounds showed high CBR affinity with Ki values within the submicromolar and subnanomolar ranges with interesting modulations in their structure-affinity relationships. In particular, fluoroderivative 7w (Ki = 0.44 nM) resulted in the most potent ligand among the imidazo[1,5-a]quinoline derivatives described so far. Overall, these observations confirmed the assumption concerning the presence of a large though apparently saturable lipophilic pocket in the CBR binding site region interacting with positions 4 and 5 of the imidazo[1,5-a]quinoline nucleus. The in vivo biological characterization revealed that compounds 7a,c,d,l,m,q,r,w show anxiolytic and antiamnestic activities without the unpleasant myorelaxant side effects of the classical 1,4-BDZ. Furthermore, the effect of 7l,q,r, and 8i in lowering lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release induced by ischemia-like conditions in rat brain slices suggested neuroprotective properties for these imidazo[1,5-a]quinoline derivatives.", 
    "223": "Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is a rare congenital disorder caused by a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11. A subset of patients exhibit social behavioural problems that meet the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the underlying molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. PX-RICS is located in the chromosomal region commonly deleted in JBS patients with autistic-like behaviour. Here we report that PX-RICS-deficient mice exhibit ASD-like social behaviours and ASD-related comorbidities. PX-RICS-deficient neurons show reduced surface \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) levels and impaired GABAAR-mediated synaptic transmission. PX-RICS, GABARAP and 14-3-3\u03b6/\u03b8 form an adaptor complex that interconnects GABAAR and dynein/dynactin, thereby facilitating GABAAR surface expression. ASD-like behavioural abnormalities in PX-RICS-deficient mice are ameliorated by enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission with a GABAAR agonist. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of PX-RICS in cognition and suggest a causal link between PX-RICS deletion and ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients.", 
    "224": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) include apathy, sleep problems, irritability, wandering, elation, agitation/aggression, and mood disorders such as depression and/or anxiety. Elderly patients are usually treated with second-generation antipsychotics; however, they present not enough efficacy against all symptoms observed. Hence, there still is an unmet need for novel pharmacotherapeutic agents targeted BPSD. A novel arylsulfonamide derivative ADN-1184 has been developed that possesses a preclinical profile of activity corresponding to criteria required for treatment of both psychosis and depressive symptoms of BPSD without exacerbating cognitive impairment or inducing motor disturbances. To broaden its pharmacological efficacy toward anxiety symptoms, its anxiolytic properties have been examined in common animal preclinical models in rats and mice. ADN-1184 significantly increased the number of entries into open arms measured in the elevated plus-maze test; however, it simultaneously increased parameters of exploratory activity. In the Vogel conflict drinking test, ADN-1184 dose-dependently and significantly increased the number of shocks accepted and the number of licks. Moreover, in mice, it also had specific anxiolytic-like activity in the four-plate test, and only negligible one at a specific mid-range dose measured in the spontaneous marble burying test. The obtained findings reveal that ADN-1184 displays anxiolytic-like activity in animal models of anxiety which employed punished stimuli. In its unusual combination of some anxiolytic action with already proven antipsychotic and antidepressant properties, and lack of any disruptive impact on learning and memory processes and motor coordination, ADN-1184 displays a profile that would be desired for a novel therapeutic for BPSD.",

This study elucidated the characteristics of equine CYPs using diazepam (DZP) as a model compound as this drug is widely used as an anesthetic and sedative in horses, and is principally metabolized by CYPs. Diazepam metabolic activities were measured in\u00a0vitro using horse and rat liver microsomes to clarify the species differences in enzyme kinetic parameters of each metabolite (temazepam [TMZ], nordiazepam [NDZ], p-hydroxydiazepam [p-OH-DZP], and oxazepam [OXZ]). In both species microsomes, TMZ was the major metabolite, but the formation rate of p-OH-DZP was significantly less in the horse. Inhibition assays with a CYP-specific inhibitors and antibody suggested that CYP3A was the main enzyme responsible for DZP metabolism in horse. Four recombinant equine CYP3A isoforms expressed in Cos-7 cells showed that CYP3A96, CYP3A94, and CYP3A89 were important for TMZ formation, whereas CYP3A97 exhibited more limited activity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested diversification of CYP3As in each mammalian order.
