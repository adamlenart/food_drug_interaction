    "0": "Effects of ID-690 on motor systems were compared with those of clonazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam. ID-690 exerted muscle relaxant action in the rotarod method using rats and mice; this action was almost equal in potency to clonazepam and nitrazepam and more potent than diazepam. Pretreatment with ID-690, clonazepam and nitrazepam increased the sleeping time of mice under thiopental anesthesia to the same degree, whereas diazepam produced a lesser effect. ID-690 was almost equal in potency to diazepam and nitrazepam in protecting against oxotremorine-induced tremor in mice, and approximately 10 times as potent as clonazepam. The anticonvulsant action of ID-690 was similar to that of clonazepam. These benzodiazepines effectively augmented the dorsal root reflexes, while showing no effects on the ventral root reflexes. Rigidity in rats due to anemic decerebration was not affected after intraduodenal administration of these drugs, while phasic augmentation of the rigidity by mechanical stimulation of the hind limb was clearly depressed. These drugs had no effects on the neuromuscular junction. From these results, it is concluded that ID-690 has a wider pharmacological spectrum than clonazepam, is almost equal in potency to nitrazepam and is more potent than diazepam.", 
    "1": "The authors take into consideration the reactivity of the E.E. Graphic focal anomalies to the i.v. infusion of 10 mg Diazepam. The cases includ 28 patients (15 with cerebral neoplasia, 8 with severe vascular accident, 5 with light vascular accident); among these, 19 showed typical E.E. Graphic focuses after administration of Diapezam, like those previously described by Weber and other Authors. Subjects with severe cerebral lesions and in the third age, after i.v. administration of 10 mg Diazepam showed vegetative disorders (hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, apnoea, periodic respiration). The reliability of the reactivity of the EEG focal anomalies to i.v. administration of Diazepam is confuted and the risks of such a methodology in subjects with severe cerebral damage or in the third age, are pointed out.", 
    "2": "Clonazepam was used in 22 instances of status epilepticus by intravenous route with particularly good results. Severe etiologies in status were common. Therapy of partial and secondarily generalized convulsion is favoured. 18 patients with epilepsies of similar classification were treated by long term oral administration with inconstant results. Spatio-temporal and dose related profiles of convulsive and electroencephalographic desactivation are demonstrated. Signs of secondary generalisation were abolished first whereas focal signs turned out more resistent proved by repeated EEG recordings. Hypnotic effect as constituent or not in parenteral status therapy is discussed.", 
    "3": "Recent developments in animal psychopharmacology were reviewed with special reference to our 10-year studies in confirming the disinhibitory theory of chlordiazepoxide in frustrative nonreward (rats), spontaneous alternation (rats), discrimination reversal (rats), successive discrimination (rats), go/no-go type descrimination (rats, monkeys), passive and shuttle avoidance (rats) and differential heart rate conditioning (rats). Although anticholinergics have a similar behavioral function, their sites of action seem to be different because of their effect on the hippocampal electrical activity is markedly distinct from that of chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "4": "Of 88 patients with intractable epilepsy, 60 have been treated with clonazepam for up to three years and 60 have been treated with sodium valproate for up to 18 months. Each agent was used sequentially in an overlapping group of 32 patients. Both agents have proven effective in the control of petit mal absences and myoclonic jerks, although some patients responded to one and not to the other. Clonazepam has given better results than valproate in temporal lobe and other partial (focal) epilepsies, while valproate has given better results in grand mal seizures and atonic attacks. Both preparations were more effective in patients with spike and wave paroxysms in their EEG recordings, the correlation being more conspicuous with valproate. Both medications appear to be safe and useful additions to anticonvulsant therapy.", 
    "5": "25 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other spastic disorders, 33 MS patients and 10 control patients with MS were given clonazepam, baclofen or placebo over a period of 5 days to 20 weeks. Both clonazepam and baclofen were significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of spasticity (p less than 0.005 or p less than 0.01). A clinical trial of clonazepam versus baclofen was carried out and this showed no significant difference between the two drugs. However, there was indication that clonazepam influenced with better improvement in patients with slight muscle hypertonia mainly of cerebral origin. Patients with more severe forms, mainly of spinal spasticity, benefited rather from baclofen treatment (Fisher's test, p = 0.003). There was suggestion that combination of the two drugs may be more effective in some patients than than clonazepam or baclofen alone.", 
    "6": "A report on first findings of quantitative investigations of beta activity in the frequency domain is presented. Spectral analysis techniques were applied in three parallel still ongoing clinical studies, i.e. (1) an exploration of beta activities in a broad clinical material, (2) a study of the possible use of quantitative beta assessment in antiepileptic drug therapy, and (3) an investigation of special patterns with harmonic components in the beta band. Several clearly distinguishable types of spectral shapes, different coherence characteristics, significant alterations by changes of drug composition and a rich variation of harmonic patterns indicate a large and fascinating new field for clinical EEG research.", 
    "7": "During a double blind trial lasting 4 weeks (Diazepam versus Loxapin), two investigators tried to identify the given drug prematurely. Only the more experienced investigator was able to identify the two drugs (p = 0.01). His judgement was based neither on observation of side-effects nor on a clinical improvement but apparently on a summary of particular subtle effects, the cognition of which requires a specific experience. The use of an adequate comparative drug instead of a placebo in a double blind study does not completely prevent a premature decoding but should reduce this risk and therefore increase the validity of the method.", 
    "8": "1. Among the numerous possibilities of drug interactions, pharmacokinetic interactions may cause mutual changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of either drug. In the present study this approach was used to investigate pertinent effects of nomifensine and clobazam. 2. Ten normal subjects participated in an intra-individual comparison of nomifensin 75 mg alone and in combination with clobazam 15 and 30 mg. The study design was carried out according to a Latin square in double-blind conditions. One-week wash-out periods were used between the trial days. Serum levels of nomifensine were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and of original clobazam by gas chromatography (GC). Classical criteria for bioavailability (peak serum levels, time of peak, area under the serum level time curve) and the half-life of elimination from the serum were used for retrieval of pharmacokinetic information. 3. Results showed no relevant differences in the criteria mentioned above, after administration of each drug alone or in combination. Therefore, extrapolations were made to multiple dose kinetics based on assumptions derived from practical therapy. They showed comprehensive agreement with therapeutic results in depressed patients. 4. The use of the classical criteria for bioavailability, in addition to the calculation of the half-time of elimination from serum, provides sufficient information for the decision whether pharmacokinetic drug interaction is present or absent. There was no such interaction after single doses of nomifensine or clobazam.", 
    "9": "Intrapulmonary gas distribution was studied in 10 extremely obese patients: (1) during spontaneous breathing awake; (2) during anaesthesia with controlled ventilation and zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP), and (3) as under (2) but with a positive end-expiratory pressure of approximately 15 cmH2O (PEEP). Gas distribution was assessed quantitatively by means of a multiple-breath nitrogen wash-out technique and subsequent fractional analysis, which permitted the calculation of nitrogen wash-out delay (NWOD). Gas distribution was also analyzed by means of a single-breath nitrogen wash-out in order to determine the slope of the \"alveolar plateau.\" Gas distribution was within normal limits during spontaneous breathing, judged from multiple-breath as well as single-breath wash-out. With anaesthesia and ZEEP, NWOD was higher, indicating less efficient gas mixing, and the slope of the \"alveolar plateau\" was twice as steep as during spontaneous breathing. With PEEP, distribution of inspired gas improved (lowered NWOD and flatter slope). Theoretical considerations and clinical experiments led to the conclusion that uneven distribution in the anaesthetized obese is caused both by regional differences in the pulmonary time constants (as in obstructive lung disease) and by airway closure.", 
    "10": "69 patients hospitalized for chronic respiratory diseases and complaining of moderate to severe insomnia were treated with placebo for 2 days, 36 subjects (52.17%) were discarded for their placebo responsiveness. To the remaining patients who suffered from severe insomnia, 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (chlordesmethyldiazepam, 2 mg orally) was administered for 7 consecutive evenings. The onset, duration, quality of sleep and the state on awakening were scored on the basis of patient subjective measurements. High scores of the four considered parameters were obtained during chlordesmethyldiazepam administration. Three treated patients complained of diurnal drowsiness. Results are discussed with regard to methodological problems in the evaluation of hypnotics.", 
    "11": "A double-blind study of 229 patients with the use of intravenous diazepam as compared with a placebo to produce sedation during local analgesia showed that significantly improved sedation occurred when diazepam was used. The diazepam was dissolved in cremophor and this reduced the pain of intravenous injection of the diazepam. One patient who received Cremophor only, showed a moderately severe allergic reaction. It is suggested that a small test dose should always be given before giving any drug which is dissolved in Cremophor.", 
    "12": "Four oxazepam tablet preparations and a suspension of micronized oxazepam in water were given to healthy, fasting volunteers in a comparative bioavailability study using a partial cross-over design. Urinary recovery (0-72 hours) was used as a measure of extent of absorption. Peak serum concentration was used as a measure of rate of absorption. The three dosage forms having the highest dissolution rate in vitro were absorbed to the same extent, while slower dissolving tablets were not as fully absorbed. Peak serum concentration correlated linearly with in vitro dissolution rate. Single oral doses of oxazepam tablets containing 10, 15 and 25 mg showed equal rates and extents of absorption and produced serum concentrations linearly correlated with dose.", 
    "13": "We studied the sensitivity of the EMIT assays of amphetamine, benzodiazepines (diazepam), methadone, opiates (morphine), and propoxyphene at different specific conductivities in urine. The specific conductivity was varied by adding NaCl. For a sensitivity of 0.5 mg of drug per liter, the urine must have a specific conductivity of less than about 35 mS/cm in all these assays except that for benzodiazepine, for which it must be less than about 20 mS/cm.", 
    "14": "In a clinically controlled trial in forceps delivery, a comparison was made between the general anaesthesia induced by ketamine and that by a combination of diazepam and N2O. Local anaesthesia was added in the diazepam group for episiotomy and suturation. The indication for operative delivery was in all cases a prolonged second stage of labour. In the katamine group, awareness was noted in four cases out of 13, even if the analgesic effect was found to be good. Four patients showed marked, short-lasting elevation of blood pressure and seven had unpleasant dreams. All thirteen mothers in the diazepam group found the anesthesia effective and the recovery pleasant. The blood pressure was stable. One mother in each group required ventilation with oxygen due to respiratory depression of short duration. Three of the children in the ketamine group and two in the diazepam group had subnormal Apgar score with slight acidosis. This was probably not attributable to the anaesthesia.", 
    "15": "In 19 patients with multiple sclerosis and 1 with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis the mean increase in muscle tonus was found to be 3.1 (range 1--4 according to Burke-Ashwort). In 10 controls with multiple sclerosis the mean spasticity was 2.4. Dantrium was given in doses up to 800 mg for 14--16 days and it caused a greater reduction of spasticity than placebo (p less than 0.05). In 12 patients (60%) varying degrees of muscle tonus reduction was observed. In 11 patients the efect of Dantrium was compared with that of other drugs (Clonazepam, Tetradiazepam, Carisoprodol and Lyoresal). In 6 cases Dantrium was a more effective drug than other muscle relaxants and in 5 cases no difference was observed or other drugs were superior to Dantrium.", 
    "16": "Drug prescriptions per capita in the United States have more than doubled since 1950 without a commensurate improvement in health. Drugs are often prescribed for clinical conditions in which therapeutic benefits do not outweigh the risk of adverse drug reactions. Deaths due to adverse drug reactions are roughly as frequent as deaths due to automobile accidents. Valium and Librium are the first and fourth most commonly prescribed drugs in the U.S., used by one ten adults each year. The rapid rise in use of these drugs has occurred during a period of rising social stress, as indicated by increases in alcohol consumption, suicide, and homicide, Valium and Librium are frequently prescribe for patients who go to doctors with social or other nonmedical problems, often in lieu of attempts to resolve these underlying problems. Overprescribing occurs because the decision to prescribe is influenced not only by consideration of therapeutic benefit, but also by nonmedical factors, for example the widespread expectation by both patient and doctor that the doctor will provide a drug or some other technological treatment. Prescribing decisions are also influenced by the profit-motivated activities of drug companies, including the expenditure of almost one-quarter of every sales dollar on drug promotion. The most widely used source of drug information for doctors is the industry-sponsored Physicians' Desk Reference, which overrates the therapeutic value of Valium and Librium as compared to disinterested medical sources. Drug companies also contribute to overprescribing by introducing numerous minor variants of existing drugs. The therapeutic benefits of such new drugs are often overestimated in the early years of use when adverse side effects are not well known and apparent efficacy is enhanced by placebo effects in uncontrolled observations.", 
    "17": "Twenty-seven consecutive cases of acute epiglottitis in children were treated by nasotracheal intubation during a 25-month period. The duration of intubation averaged 44.2 hours. No mortality or morbidity occurred. Mean hospitalization was 4.5 days. Anaesthetic techniques are discussed. Ketamine is a somewhat controversial choice for these patients as it can enhance excitement, restlessness, and accidental extubation. This study reconfirms the ease of maintaining an assured airway by nasotracheal intubation in cases of acute epiglottitis.", 
    "18": "The effects of a single 10 mg oral dose of nitrazepam were compared with those of a placebo in healthy young and old people. Both the young and the elderly slept better on three successive nights after nitrazepam but they felt less awake at 12 and 36 hours (P less than 0-01). Elderly people made significantly more mistakes in a psychomotor test than did the young, despite similar plasma concentrations of nitrazepam and half lives in the two groups. This difference in response to psychomotor testing is probably explained by an increased sensitivity of the ageing brain to the action of nitrazepam.", 
    "19": "The effects of prolonged treatment with phenobarbital, diazepam, and oxazepam on behaviour and on the plasma half-life of antipyrine have been studied in the dog. In this species the biotransformation of diazepam and oxazepam is known to be very similar to man. After equipotent doses of phenobarbital (25 mg/kg) and diazepam (35 mg/kg), antipyrine half-life was found to decrease 80 and 40%, respectively, while after treatment with oxazepam (150 mg/kg) there was an increase of 20%. The behavioural effects declined in the dogs during the course of treatment with diazepam but were rather constant during treatment with oxazepam.", 
    "20": "The pharmacokinetics of oxazepam was investigated in 13 uremic patients. The apparent terminal half-life of oxazepam in plasma was 24-91 hours compared to 5.9-25 hours reported elsewhere for healthy volunteers. The plasma concentrations showed secondary peaks about 24 hours after the dose and this probably gave rise to the increase in half-life. Plasma clearance of oxazepam appeared to be normal. The conjugated metabolites accumulated to concentrations 5-50 times those of the parent compound and could still be detected 5 days after a single oral dose (0.2 mg/kg). Renal clearance of conjugated oxazepam was significantly correlated to creatinine clearance. The urinary recovery over 5 days was 18-57%. The faecal recovery of 3 days was 0.1-19%. In some patients up to 49% of oxazepam in faeces was in the conjugated form. It is concluded that enterohepatic recycling of oxazepam might occur in uremic patients but is not of great quantitative importance. During multiple dosing the accumulation of conjugates was even more pronounced, with plasma concentrations amounting to 14-61 times those of oxazepam. Steady-state plasma concentrations of oxazepam was similar to those obtained in normal subjects.", 
    "21": "The pharmacokinetics of oxazepam was studied in healthy volunteers. When oral doses of 15 mg were given to eight subjects on two occasions 2.5 years apart the individual areas under the plasma concentration time curves did not differ significantly. Plasma clearance ranged between 0.050 and 0.171 x kg-1 x h-1 and half-lives from 5.9 to 25 hours. The urinary recovery of oxazepam conjugates was 67 +/- 15 S.D.% of the dose given and the total recovery including faecal oxazepam was 70 +/- 15 S.D. %. On multiple dosing (5 mg t.i.d.) stable steady-state concentrations were established. There was a tendency for slightly lower steady-state concentrations than predicted from single oral doses. During steady-state 86 +/- 17 S.D. % of the dose was recovered in the urine over a 24 hour period.", 
    "22": "Oxazepam dissolved in propylene glycol was administered intravenously to dogs. There were no cardiac or general adverse effects. Hemolysis and thrombophlebitis were observed after rapid infusion (5.6 ml in 1 minute), and were shown to be due to the properties of the vehicle. Comparison of plasma concentration time curves after oral and intravenous administration indicated a bioavailability of 70 +/- 15 S.D. %. The decreased availability after oral dose was considered to be due to first pass elimination as the urinary recovery of metabolites was the same after the two routes of administration. This also indicates complete absorption. In a dog with a chronic biliary fistula 15 mg of oxazepam was given intravenously on two occasions. When normal bile flow into the gut was permitted the disposition of oxazepam was similar to that in normal dogs. When bile was withdrawn the elimination of oxazepam was more rapid with an increase of apparent plasma clearance. In this case 32% of the dose was excreted as conjugates in the bile within 3 hours after administration. In the normal dogs 2-20% of the dose given was recovered in the faeces as the parent compound and practically no conjugates were found. These findings indicate enteral hydrolysis of the conjugates, and a marked enterohepatic recycling or oxazepam.", 
    "23": "The hypnotic effect of dixyrazine (a phenothiazine derivate), nitrazepam and amylobarbitone was studied during six months in 52 geriatric inpatients (17, 16 and 19 in each group, respectively) with a mean age of 78 years. The variables registered were the percentage of patients asleep at 10 pm and 6 am and the observed number of awakenings. Certain mental and somatic variables were rated according to a schedule for geriatric behaviour. The observations were made every two to three weeks. No systematic significant change with time was observed for any of the three drugs for the percentage of patients asleep at 10 pm or 6 am or for the number of awakenings. Nor was any difference found between the three drugs in respect of these variables. There was no significant change in somatic or mental variables according to the geriatric rating schedule. The results indicate that dixyrazine, nitrazepam and amylobarbitone retain their hypnotic effect in geriatric patients during continuous use for a six-month period. No side effects were observed that influenced the patient' behaviour. The results do not support the view that barbiturates, i.e. amylobarbitone are inappropriate as hypnotics in the elderly patient.", 
    "24": "Serial estimations (87) of serum cystine aminopeptidase (CAP) in pregnant women (18) using diphenyl hydantoin, phenobarbital or diazepam revealed that the enzyme levels were below the average for normals in 89% of patients. The initially low CAP levels in women on diazepam were improved within 24 h after betamethasone administration. Subsequent studies in vitro confirmed that diphenyl hydantoin, phenobarbital, diazepam and acetyl salicylate markedly inhibited CAP levels in sera of women (72) with clinically uncomplicated pregnancy. No inhibition of CAP by any of the drugs tested was observed in sera from nonpregnant women (8). However, nonpregnant women receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injections showed CAP inhibition by various drugs, suggesting some changes in the enzyme moiety under the influence of the hormone.", 
    "25": "In nonstressed rats, subcutaneous administration of haloperidol (HAL) and large doses of diazepam (DZ) increased plasma corticosterone (CS). Hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) was lowered significantly by desmethylimipramine (DMI), HAL and, to a lesser extent, by DZ and phenobarbital (PHB). In rats pretreated with either DZ, DMI, HAL or PHB the restraint-induced rise of CS was diminished, DZ being most potent. CPZ had a variable effect, slightly increasing or decreasing the CS response. Pretreatment (16 hr) with pargyline (PA) did not affect the CS rise to stress. The reduction of hypothalamic NE evoked by restraint was attenuated by DZ, and to a lesser extent, by PHB and HAL. Restraint of PA-treated rats did not lower the PA-elevated hypothalamic NE. The stress-induced increase in hypothalamic dopamine was prevented by CPZ and, partially, by PHB. It is emphasized that the net plasma CS and brain catecholamine changes in response to stress are dependent on the drug-induced neuroendocrine feedback state prevalent immediately before commencement of the stress procedure.", 
    "26": "The present experiments were undertaken to study the possible effects of Gaba, Gabob, phenobarbitone, diphenylhydantoin, and diazepam given systemically on convulsant activity evoked in chicks by intrahypothalamic injection of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP). Diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbitone antagonized the effect of dibutyryl cAMP but unfortunately the effects of Gaba and Gabob were complicated by osmotic effects. Diazepam, an anticonvulsant benzodiazepine, did not affect dibutyryl cAMP-induced electrocortical spiking. The dibutyryl cAMP-induced syndrome seems to be of limited value as a model for assessing the activity of anticonvulsant drugs are present.", 
    "27": "Because previous ultrastructural studies of murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) had revealed only mononuclear cell infiltration with no cytopathology of target cells in the choroid plexus, ependyma, and leptomeninges, diazepam treatment was used to prolong survival for characterization of late pathogenetic events. Mice which were treated with diazepam and sacrificed 8, 9, and 10 days after intracerebral inoculation with LCM virus showed an increasing amount of inflammatory infiltration into choroid plexuses, leptomeninges, Virchow-Robin spaces, and ependyma. Mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes increased in number as compared with terminally infected mice sacrificed 7 days after inoculation. Ultrastructurally, choroidal epithelial cells showed cytopathological changes varying from dilated endoplasmic reticulum through necrosis. Greater numbers of PMN leukocytes, macrophages, and activated macrophages and fewer undifferentiated mononuclear cells were seen in choroid plexuses of the drug-treated survivors. Virions and larger, more numerous arenavirus inclusions were present in choroid plexus and ependyma. Ultrastructurally the leptomeningitis was characterized by large numbers of activated macrophages. Choroidal epithelial necrosis appears to be the in vivo correlate of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro.", 
    "28": "The effect exerted by 5 groups of psychotropic agents on b activity of Ca, Mg-dependent ATP-ase of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum in the skeletal muscles of the rabbit and the transport of Ca2+ were looked into. The most profound inhibitory effect was found to be displayed by neuroleptics--phenothiazine derivatives with the piperazine ring in the side chain. Neuroleptics-butyrophenones produced a much less marked inhibitory action. Tricyclic antidepressants noticeably reduced the activity of the enzyme, while MAO inhibitors proved little effective in this respect. Tranquilizers--benzodiazepine derivatives--displayed a moderate inhibitory influence, while trioxazine turned out to be little active. The stimulants caffein, pentylene tetrazol (corazol), as well as high concentrations of lithium salts raised, whereas their low concentrations suppressed the activity of the enzyme. The inhibitory effect of psychotropic agents increased by as much s 11/2--2 times with regard to the enzyme preliminarily activated through incubation with ATP.", 
    "29": "Ethosuximide, clonazepam and valproic acid differ in their chemical structures and properties. They appear to be well absorbed when given by mouth, but their patterns of distribution within the body are different. If these 3 drugs have a common mode of action, the virtual restriction of valproate to extracellular water suggests that this common mode of action is likely to involve receptors on the neuronal cell surface. Even if there is no common mode of action the apparent volume of distribution of valproate is consistent with its known effects on enzymes of the GABA shunt, and in particular on those shunt enzymes which are involved in the transmitter GABA pool in the region of synapses. The 3 drugs also show differences in elimination rate, which make it desirable to give valproate 3 times a day and clonazepam twice a day, whereas ethosuximide could reasonably be given once daily without undesirably wide fluctuations in plasma drug level over the dosage interval. Further studies of the pharmacokinetics of ethosuximide, clonazepam and valproate are still needed, but sufficient data are already available to provide some basis for rational use of these drugs in treating petit mal 'absence' epilepsy.", 
    "30": "48 patients with several types of seizures (following the international classification of epileptic seizures), were studied. Dipotassium chlorazepate was administered as a secondary antiepileptic drug. The cases were selected due to the severity of their seizures. The therapeutic results were evaluated with a daily record of seizures and attempt was made to correlate the serum levels of nordiazepam with the clinical results.", 
    "31": "The absolute and relative bioavailability of flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) tablet, oral solution and suppository formulations was determined in a cross-over study on 6 healthy volunteers. The tablet and the oral solution were shown to be bioequivalent, absorption being at least 80%. For flunitrazepam suppositories the bioavailability was found to be about 50%. The plasma concentrations are described on the basis of a three-compartment model, the adjustment of the curves from the same subject being made simultaneously. The central compartment and the second compartment are about equal in size and rapid exchange takes place between them. The third compartment is about four times as large as the central one. The slow reflux of the compound from the third to the first compartment is the rate determining factor for the overall elimination in the beta-phase.", 
    "32": "Camazepam, a dimethylcarbamic derivative of benzodiazepines, was studied on forty geriatric in-patients suffering from psychic disorders concerning anxiety and depression. Patients were treated with placebo and 30 mg of camazepam per day for 20 days using the double-blind method. The patients were assessed using a simplified rating scale with target symptoms of anxiety and depression. Statistical evaluation was performed with general Student's t-test for paired samples and chi2 test. Both groups of patients improved with camazepam and placebo. Camazepam 30 mg per day was more effective than placebo to a statistically significant degree.", 
    "33": "The authors studied the effects of flunitrazepam, trazodone and sulpiride on recovery reactions following ketamine anaesthesia, in male patients aged between 15 and 25 years, following minor orthopaedic surgery. Only flunitrazepam and trazodone proved to be effective, whilst sulpiride was quite useless in the prevention of recovery reactions. The authors nevertheless feel that trazodone is preferable to flunitrazepam since it reduces all recovery reactions and, in particular, because it reduces the agitation induced by ketamine, rendering the pseudo-hallucinations pleasant, and because it is free of the hypnotic component of flunitrazepam, often inconstant and sometimes responsible for the patient swallowing his tongue.", 
    "34": "An important part of the pre-operative preparation of a patient consists in the treatment of his anxiety. One hundred eighty-two patients (varying in age from 17 to 80 years) were sedated for surgery with lorazepam. The evening before intervention, each patient received 1 tablet of lorazepam (2.5 mg) and on the day of operation (90 minutes before induction of the anesthesia), each patient received an I.M. injection of lorazepam and atropine, the dosage being adjusted to body weight. The prior administration of lorazepam usually gives very good results with only slight risk of side-effects and without unhappy recollections of the pre- and post-operative periods. Most of the patients were very calm, being well rested, conscious and capable of conversation. In our experience the sedation of anxious patients with lorazepam would seem to be a very good and safe procedure.", 
    "35": "The effect of clonazepam, taken per-os and in very progressive doses, has been studied by the authors on fourteen children afflicted with evolutive epileptic encephalopathies and still presenting, in spite of heavy anti-epileptic polychemio-therapies, alarming clinical and electrical manifestations. Clonazepam proved to be an efficient contributive factor in the course of a curing process since, in 70% of the cases, it produced quite a visible amelioration. Its efficient action seems to last longer than that of other diazepines since half of their patients have now been treated with it for more than a year with, as a result, a constant clinical and electrical amelioration. As a last point, it appears to be a very useful drug when dealing with type of rebellious epilepsies since, when combined with other benzodiazepines, seldom side-effects and no \"crossed resistances\" can be observed.", 
    "36": "Patients attending their family practitioner with emotional disturbance manifesting predominantly as anxiety were treated once daily for 4 weeks with either a pure anxiolytic, potassium clorazepate, or a formulation of a specific antidepressant together with an anxiolytic, fluphenazine/nortriptyline, in accordance with a double-blind, completely randomized design. After the first week the patients receiving fluphenazine/nortriptyline were showing a better response in terms of total symptomatology as well as anxiety, tension and depression taken separately, and after 4 weeks treatment this trend reached statistically significant levels on both the physicans' ratings and the patients' self-ratings for overall symptomatology (p less than 0-05) as well as anxiety and tension on the physicians' scale (p less than 0-01). Side-effects were infrequent, with the exception of drowsiness which was complained of by 42% of the patients receiving clorazepate. Although simple and convenient to take, a once daily benzodiazepine formulation of fixed dose is likely to be too inflexible to achieve optimal therapeutic effect in many patients. These results are in accord with accumulating evidence for the importance of a depressive aetiology underlying the majority of so-called anxiety states in family practice. Anxiolytic, in the absence of specific antidepressant, therapy is unlikely to be adequate for these patients, and may lead to long-term palliative use of benzodiazepines incurring a risk of dependence.", 
    "37": "Diazepam and flunitrazepam were compared in equipotent doses as induction agents for premedicated patients having cardiac surgery. Both drugs caused a significant fall in arterial blood pressure, a rise in Paco2 and a fall in Pao2. There was no significant difference between the two drugs in onset time of anaesthesia, cardiovascular or respiratory depression, or quality of induction. There was also no significant difference from induction with thiopentone in these respects. Diazepam, over a 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg range of doses showed no difference in toxicity, although induction was clinically smoother with the higher dose.", 
    "38": "The present two-phase study was designed to determine the optimum hynotic dose of triazolam and to assess any evidence of acute tolerance. Subjective and objective data were used to assess hypnotic efficacy. In the dose-titration phase, the dose of triazolam was increased in 0-5 mg increments to the highest level tolerated by each individual patient. Maximum tolerable doses ranged between 0-5 and 3-0 mg; however, all subjects experienced maximum therapeutic effect at 1-5 mg triazolam. During the 4-night acute tolerance portion of the study no clear evidence of tolerance was found.", 
    "39": "An open clinical study was conducted with carpipramine in 100 hospitalized subjects presenting various mental disorders. The therapeutic results on symptoms were assessed both as a whole and with the help of a rating scale. Doses varied from 50 to 400 mg per day. Carpipramine seems to be particularly efficient on schizophrenias, 66 cases of which were tested. The best results were observed in hebephrenic forms and depressive syndroms during the illness; in these indications, carpipramine exerts a clear psychomotor stimulating activity which is useful in decreasing indifference, apathy and ideomotor slowness. Schizophrenias with paranoid delusions or depersonalization anxiety tend to be somehow aggravated. Carpipramine does not seem to be a true antidepressant despite its desinhibitory properties. The compound proves useful in deficits of the psychomotor tone such as those occuring in psychasthenia or the deficit syndrom which follows withdrawal from opiates. Clinical and biological tolerances seem to be excellent and extrapyramidal side effects are exceptional. Carpipramine may be considered as a strongly desinhibitory neuroleptic agent which bears some resemblance to antidepressants because of its psychoanaleptic effect. The authors raise the question of possible antipsychotic properties in higher doses in relation to pharmacological data and a bipolar, antipsychotic and predominantly desinhibitory, therapeutic action.", 
    "40": "In some insomniacs under flunitrazepam treatment is noted on one hand a global increase of dream memories, and on the other hand an increase of dreams with unpleasant or anxious contents. The present investigation is intended first to test the hypothesis of a possible increase of mental contents in sleep outside the paradoxical phases, to account for the increase of dream memories without concomitant increase of paradoxical stage. Second it intends to investigate if the increase of unpleasant dreams may be found in the normal subject in laboratory.", 
    "41": "The effects were studied of a standardised general anaesthesia on mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, blood gas values and the course of cataract operations. The material consisted of 20 unselected senile cataract operations, the mean age of the patients being 71.3 years. The arterial blood pressure was continuously checked, using an intra-arterial cannula. In order to avoid vitreous loss, the blood pressure was successfully kept optimally low during the extraction of the lens. No vitreous problems were noted. The oxygenation and ventilation of the patients were sufficient during anaesthesia and immediately postoperatively.", 
    "42": "By means of polygraphic sleep recordings (EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, EDG, Respirogram, Positogram), neurologic-psychologic investigation and questionnaires on subjective feeling, ten patients aged from 22 to 40 years (mean: 29 years), who suffered from irregular disturbances in falling asleep and in sleeping continuously, were examined over a period of ten consecutives nights. The first investigation night was reserved for adaptation of the patients and could therefore not be evaluated. On the following three evenings placebo (Placebo I) was given, then 2 mg of flunitrazepam for the ensuing three nights and placebo again (Placebo II) for the last three nights. Thus, 90 investigation nights could be evaluated. 1. Latency times until the patients fell asleep and up to the first deep sleep were reduced significantly by the active preparation. Latency times up to the first REM-phase were prolonged. 2. The frequency of nocturnal awakenings was lessened significantly. Thus, disturbances in sleeping continuously disappeared for the duration of the treatment. Duration of wakefulness after having woken during the night decreased considerably. 3. Duration of wakefulness during the total night was reduced considerably, deeper sleep stages, such as D (stage III) and E(stage IV) were prolonged. 4. Duration of the REM-phases was reduced slightly. This reduction was not significant according to the t-test. 5. According to these results, the preparation showed a clear effect. A placebo-effect can be excluded, since the improvements mentioned were not found when placebo was given before administration of the medication and afterwards (Placebo I and II). 6. When comparing our results to those of other authors, who described the effects of various preparations, we found that the substance flunitrazepam showed different effects.", 
    "43": "To evaluate the clinical effects of lorazepam on neurosis, a double-blind controlled trial by group comparison procedure was carried out using diazepam and placebo as control drugs. The clinical improvement and aggravation rates by means of a variety of assessment of change were compared between each of the two active drugs and placebo. The superiority, characteristics of therapeutic effects and minor side effects of lorazepam which is similar to those of diazepam, a standard benzodiazepine anxiolytic for the treatment of neurosis, were demonstrated. From this study, many important problems which might be influenced upon the outcome of the pharmacotherapy on neurotics, such as positive and negative placebo effects, aggravation and drop-out during the trial, were also evaluated.", 
    "44": "The anesthesiologist uses a wide spectrum of drugs, including inhalational general anesthetics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, narcotics analgesics and their antagonists, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. All of these drugs in sufficient dose impair the ventilatory response to chemical stimuli, and may cause inadequate gas exchange. The effect of depression of ventilatory control depends on the magnitude of depression and the coexistence of functional abnormalities in the respiratory system. The functional abnormalities are the result of preexistent pulmonary disease or other disease processes that impair respiratory function, the anticipated effects of major surgery (e.g., pulmonary resection), and the complications of anesthesia and surgery. From a functional viewpoint, the mechanisms of the effects of these disease processes on ventilatory control are: (1) interference with the neurophysiological control of automatic ventilation; (2) impairment of peripheral or central chemoreceptor function; (3) impairment of respiratory muscle function; (4) increase in the mechanical load to breathing as a result of increased resistance or decreased compliance of the respiratory system; and (5) increase in the ventilatory requirements as a result of ventilation/blood flow maldistribution, metabolic acidosis, or increased metabolic rate. As a result of current trends in the use of multiple drugs and controlled ventilation during anesthesia, the patient is at greatest risk during the early postoperative period in the recovery room. In addition to the functional abnormalities described above, the probability of impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure is increased as a result of impaired metabolism and elimination of drugs as a result of hepatic and renal insufficiency, and acute changes in acidbase status, which alter the ionization and distribution of drugs.", 
    "45": "Experiments staged on rats demonstrated that the formation of pathological states caused by stress and accompained by the development of ulcerative lesion of the gastric mucosa are associated with the degree of the catecholamines level drop in the mesencephalon and hypothalamus. The application of seduxen and also of combinations consisting of L-DOPA with seduxen, or with an L-adrenoblocking agent-pyroxan tends to reduce the frequency of developing ulcerative lesions of the stomach. The protective effect produced by the combination of L-DOPA with an L-adrenoblocking agent--pyroxan is barred by an additional administration of an beta-adrenoblocking agent--inderal.", 
    "46": "High performance liquid chromatography in connection with monochromatic UV-detection has proved to be a powerful tool for separation and quantitative determination of drugs and their metabolites in body fluids. Serum samples from volunteers medicated with the psychotropic drugs fosazepam and nomifensine are analysed by this method. Separation times are less than 5 min; the detection limits are within the range of 30-50 ng/ml serum. The reliability of the method is discussed: The results are compared to those from the same serum samples obtained by measurement of total radioactivity and by quantitative mass spectrometry in order to confirm the accuracy of the method. Examples of the pharmacokinetic profile of the two drugs and their metabolites in serum are presented, based on analysis by the methods described.", 
    "47": "Three benzodiazepines in equipotent doses: oxazepam 15 mg, dipotassium chlorazepate 10 mg and diazepam 5 mg, were administered in single, oral doses to seven healthy volunteers in a three-way cross-over study. The serum concentrations of oxazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam and diazepam were followed for 72 hours by gas chromatography and electron capture detection. The absorption of diazepam was most rapid and the mean time required to reach peak serum concentration was 45 minutes, followed by N-desmethyldiazepam 80 minutes and oxazepam 114 minutes. The serum concentration decay curves were biphasic with terminal mean half-lives of 48, 62 and 11 hours for diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam, respectively. The mean and individual serum concentration time data were fitted to a two-compartment open model with first order absorption using a non linear least square program. The mean serum data fitted the model well. The same rank order was obtained with mean absorption half-lives as when comparing mean peak times while slightly shorter terminal half-lives were obtained in the curve fitting of mean serum data. Due to irregularities in the serum concentration time curves only five out of the 21 sets of individual data could satisfy the convergence criterion. The obtained parameters in the curve fitting were also accompanied with very large asymptotic standard deviations.", 
    "48": "Clinical observations led to the assumption that there is an antihypertensive effect of bromazepam in patients suffering from mild benign hypertension. Because of this observation we studied the antihypertensive effect of bromazepam by means of a standardized simple submaximal ergometric load performed weekly over a 4-week period of observation. A control group of 68 hypertensive patients without any drug therapy but under active physical training combined with physiotherapy and medicinal baths showed only a slight decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest (about 4%). Furthermore, the pulse frequency did not change. In contrast, there was a distinct and significant decrease in blood pressure at rest and during exercise after a 3-week period of additional treatment with bromazepam, especially in hypertensive patients. One group of 68 hypertensive patients receiving 9 mg bromazepam daily showed a mean reduction in blood pressure by 14.4% systolic and 12.7% diastolic at rest, and during exercise by 7.5% systolic and 6.8% diastolic. The heart remained practically unchanged. A somewhat slighter decrease of the blood pressure values was seen in an additional group of 31 hypertensive patients receiving 6 mg bromazepam per day and in a group of 30 normotensive patients receiving 9 mg bromazepam daily. The calculated indices such as the product of heart rate and mean systolic pressure and the tension time index in the groups receiving bromazepam pointed to a better economic work performance under reduced myocardial pressure effort and reduced oxygen demand on the myocardium. The possible action of bromazepam in reducing blood pressure will be discussed.", 
    "49": "Twenty out-patients suffering from anxiety and tension after withdrawal from alcohol were treated for 28 days with alprazolam. Three patients dropped out for intercurrent events, and 2 dropped out for recurrent drinking. Of the 15 patients completing the study, analysis of variance showed significant improvement in all Physician's Ratings as well as all patient self-ratings. At the 28th day, 93% of the patients rated moderate to marked improvement on the Physician's Global Impression and Therapeutic Effect, and 93% self rated at least a little better. Side-effects were generally mild and inconsequential. No adverse effects attributable to alprazolam were noted on laboratory evaluations, EKG's or ophthalmologic examinations.", 
    "50": "Harmaline increases cerebellar 3':5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content in a dose-related manner; this increase is prevented by a pretreatment with 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) (0.66 mmol/kg) which destroys climbing fibers and inhibits harmaline-induced tremor. The cerebellar cGMP content increases after isoniazid; this response remains unchanged in rats pretreated with 3-AP. Since isoniazid decreases cerebellar gamma-aminobuturic acid (GABA) levels, the increase in cGMP content might reflect a reduction in the availability of GABA at the level of postsynaptic receptors. Apomorphine (a dopamine receptor agonist) and haloperidol (a dopamine receptor blocker) increase or decrease the cGMP content of cerebellar cortex, respectively. Neither drug changes the guanylate cyclase activity of cerebellar homogenates; moreover their action on cerebellar cGMP content persists after 3-AP. Chloropromazine, like haloperidol, decreases the cerebellar cGMP content. The increase in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by apomorphine can be differentiated from that elicited by harmaline or isoniazid; presumably apomorphine indirectly activates mossy fibers. The decrease in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by haloperidol can be differentiated from that elicited by diazepam; perhaps haloperidol reduces the mossy fiber input to the cerebellum. We suggest that the cGMP content of cerebellar cortex fluctuates in response to changes in the afferent stimulatory input to the cerebellum; it increases when the activity of either climbing or mossy fibers is increased; it decreases when either of these two stimulatory inputs is reduced.", 
    "51": "A specially designed tablet dosage form of the benzodiazepine clorazepate dipotassium (Tranxene) was developed for once-a-day administration. The drug was administered at a dose of 22.5 mg as (1) the tablet, (2) three 7.5 mg capsules, or (3) one 7.5-mg capsule given every 6 hours. Peak serum levels from the tablet were intermediate between those of the single- and divided-dose capsule regimens. The desired decrease in magnitude of peak levels was obtained without affecting the extent of absorption. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data according to a two-compartment open model with first-order absorption indicated that the serum half-life (t0.5beta) of nordiazepam, the major biotransformation product present in serum, was about 48 hours and served as a basis for the design of a multiple-dose steady-state study. Multiple-dose administration of the tablet and divided-capsule regimen to two groups of subjects for ten days indicated each dosage form yielded similar minimum steady-state serum levels of about 0.6 micrograms/ml which plateaued following seven days of drug administration. The dosage forms were crossed over between the groups on day 11 and administered for an additional four days. The minimum serum levels obtained with the tablet and capsule were not statistically different. Additionally, the peak serum level and area under the curve (pi=24 hours) at steady state were equivalent between the dosage forms. Good agreement was obtained between model-predicted and observed serum levels during multiple-dose administration for both the tablet and capsule regimens. The serum half-life of nordiazepam following 14 days of clorazepate dipotassium administration was similar to that found after a single dose. These results indicate that a single daily dose of drug as the tablet produced serum levels equivalent to a divided-capsule regimen.", 
    "52": "The activity in vitro of tibezonium (Rec 15-0691), a new 1,5-benzodiazepine derivative, has been investigated. The drug was found active especially against Streptococcus, Diplococcus and Corynebacterium strains which are agents of oropharyngeal diseases. The activity of tibezonium was pH dependent against Staphylococcus aureus SG 511 and Streptococcus pyogenes 821 (at pH 8.0-8.5 It was more active) and the presence of horse serum provoked a small decrease of the antimicrobial properties. No interference on the activity of the tibezonium has been found in presence of smokers and non-smokers saliva.", 
    "53": "The reasons for exclusion of prisoners from research studies on drugs were based mostly on a relatively limited group of laboratory parameters which could have been detected using a simple battery of screening tests. The answers to a medical history form added little to the evaluation of either the prisoner or student groups, were probably very unreliable, and could be just as well confined to a few selected questions regarding drug history as a matter of record. Students gave appropriate responses to a mood scale measurement test while prisoners characteristically did not comply. Because of a combination of various institutional and sociological factors, prisoners probably represent a special subgroup of research volunteers whose health status may not be representative of the total \"healthy\" population. They are unlikely to give accurate or reliable responses in testing situations which rely upon reporting of the subjective effects of drugs with regard to tolerance or pharmacologic effect. Studies of investigational drugs where the likelihood of potentiaal risk is significant should be avoided in such populations unless compliance has been assessed adequately.", 
    "54": "A double-blind crossover trial comparing lorazepam at two dosage levels with amylobarbitone supported previous reports of the effective anxiolytic action of the drug. Evaluation of the patients' responses during each week of treatment was based on a physician's weekly rating and on daily self-rating by patients. The results were analyzed by sequential and nonsequential analyses. The main side effect of the drug was drowsiness, which occurred to a clinically significant degree among the high-dose group of patients. The authors emphasize the value of two dosage trials, particularly in devising subsequent flexible individual treatment regimens.", 
    "55": "Serial EEG and EMG investigations were performed in the course of a histologically verified case of Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease. Some electrophysiologic data, including visual-evoked responses were analyzed using a computer. Correlations between clinical and EEG findings suggest that the generator of the periodic discharges may be localized in some circumscribed area of the upper brain stem, probably the thalamus. The inhibitory effect of various narcotics suggests that the pacemaker of the triphasic discharges has relations to the nonspecific activating system.", 
    "56": "Spike discharges of single cerebellar Purkinje cells were recorded continuously with extracellular microelectrodes in unanesthetized curarized rats. The intravenous injection of diphenylhydantoin in doses between 10 and 100 mg kg-1 did not substantially alter the activity of Purkinje cells within 2--3 h. The two benzodiazepines, diazepam and clonazepam, already in low i.v. doses (0.03--0.1 mg kg-1) consistently and reversibly depressed the firing rate. Our results do not support the previously advanced hypothesis that these drugs reduce epileptiform activities by increasing the output from the cerebellar cortex. They rather point to the possibility that a reduced firing rate of cerebellar Purkinje cells mediates at least in part ataxia and muscular hypotonia observed after the drugs.", 
    "57": "Relative partition coefficients (P) of 1,4-benzodiazepines were determined by a reversed-phase thin-layer chromatographic (RP-TLC) technique in the systemoleyl alcohol-water, and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using several column packing materials. RMw values, obtained by RP-TLC, correlated well with log P values determined directly in the system oleyl alcohol-water and with the literature values for the system 1-octanol-water. Th log k' w values from the HPLC experiments could be determined with greater precision, but the correlations of log k'w with log Poleyl alcohol and log Poctanol were not as good as those found for the Rmw values.", 
    "58": "Diazepam suppressed arginine-induced glucagon release from the isolated perfused rat pancreas in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of approximately 65 microM. In contrast, insulin release was enhanced by 10-50 microM diazepam, but inhibited by higher concentrations of drug. Thus, 50 microM diazepam simultaneously suppressed glucagon and increased insulin release in this model. The potentiation of insulin release may result from phosphodiesterase inhibition. The inhibitory effects on hormone release are discussed in terms of diazepam's molecular conformation, which is similar to that of diphenylhydantoin, an inhibitor of both glucagon and insulin release in the isolated perfused rat pancreas. The possibility is also considered that the conformation of both compounds might be similar to the apparent active site of the hormone release inhibitor somatostatin.", 
    "59": "VP-16-213, a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, is an active antitumor agent. In this paper, the effects of VP-16-213 and podophyllotoxin on microtubule assembly in vitro and nucleoside transport in HeLa cells are compared. At 100 muM, VP-16-213 does not inhibit microtubule assembly in vitro, while 5 muM podophyllotoxin completely prevents the formation of microtubules. The presence of the glucoside moiety in VP-16-213 is responsible for the inactivity of VP-16-213 in this system because 4'-demethylepipodo-phyllotoxin, the nonglucoside congener of VP-16-213, inhibits microtubule assembly. In HeLa cells, VP-16-213 and podophyllotoxin share a common biological property; both agents inhibit the uptake of thymidine and uridine into cells by inhibiting the facilitated diffusional component of nucleoside transport. The conncentrations of drug necessary to inhibit thymidine and uridine uptake into HeLa cells by 50% are 10 and 5 muM, respectively, for podophyllotoxin, and 25 and 20 muM for VP-16-213. The action of podophyllotoxin on nucleoside transport appears unrelated to its effect on microtubule assembly, since VP-16-213, which does not inhibit microtubule assembly, inhibits nucleoside transport.", 
    "60": "To evaluate the effect of end-stage renal insufficiency and haemodialysis on the elimination of lorazepam, single oral doses of the drug (2.5 mg) were administered to normal subjects and patients with chronic renal failure (CC(r) : less than 2 ml/min) in the interdialysis period and during haemodialysis. The concentration of lorazepam and its major metabolite, lorazepam-glucuronide, were assayed using electron capture g.l.c. Plasma half-life (T1/2) of unchanged lorazepam in the patient group (11.3 +/- 0.6 h) was not different from that obtained in normals (11.1 +/- 0.9 h). Only minor quantities of the unchanged drug could be recovered in the 24 h urine in both groups: 0.3% of the ingested dose in normals and trace amounts in the patient group. No unchanged lorazepam could be detected in the ultrafiltrate from the coil kidney. Since the lower sensitivity of the method is about 5 ng/ml, this would indicate the in vivo binding of the active drug to plasma proteins to be at least 70%. The effect of haemodialysis on lorazepam plasma T1/2 was also insignificant (9.4 +/- 1.0 h). Urinary excretion of lorazepam-glucuronide was found to be considerably decreased in chronic renal failure associated with accumulation of high concentrations of this conjugate in plasma during days after a single oral dose. The plasma T1/2 of this conjugate in normals was 20.7 +/- 2.1 h. Roughly 35% of this main metabolite's concentration in plasma was detected in the ultrafiltrate from the coil kidney indicating the dialyzability of this conjugate and that the extent of plasma protein binding of lorazepam-glucuronide in vivo was approximately 65%. The above results indicate that after a single oral dose (2.5 mg) the biotransformation of lorazepam to its glucuronide conjugate remains unaltered and that high concentrations of this metabolite accumulate in plasma in the presence of severe renal function impairment."
