Radioimmunoassay and immunomorphological PAP methods were used to examine the blood PGI and gastrin levels, the number of gastroduodenal G and D cells, the characteristics of basal and stimulated acid production in gastric juice in the treatment with gastrozepin (22 persons) and ranisen (23 persons). Depending on the concentration of gastrin in the blood and the number of pyloric G cells, the patients were distributed into two groups: with hypergastrinemia and/or hyperplasia of G cells (48%) and with normogastrinemia and the normal number of these cells (52%). It has been shown that the continuous treatment with gastrozepin of the patients with hypergastrinemia and/or hyperplasia of pyloric G cells was followed by the normalization of blood gastrin concentration and of the number of pyloric G cells; on the contrary in the patients with normogastrinemia and the normal amount of these cells, the analogous characteristics remained unchanged. After the treatment with ranisan the patients with normogastrinemia and the normal amount of pyloric G cells manifested hypergastrinemia without any changes in the amount of G cells; meanwhile in the patients with hypergastrinemia and/or hyperplasia of G cells, the analogous characteristics were unchanged. In these groups patients, the rate and the times of the relapse occurrence were different throughout the whole year. The data obtained support the nonuniformity of duodenal ulcer.", 
    "1": "The purpose of this study was to test the effects of the new beta-carboline ZK 93426 on midazolam-induced cardiorespiratory depression. Seven pentobarbital-anesthetized (35 mg/kg i.p.) cats were treated with intravenous midazolam (2 mg/kg) while monitoring the respiratory minute volume (VE), tidal volume, respiratory rate, blood pressure, heart rate and expired CO2. Midazolam caused significant decreases in VE (p less than 0.05) and blood pressure (p less than 0.05). ZK 93426 (5 mg/kg i.v.) antagonized these effects and produced significant increases in VE and blood pressure that resulted in the return of these variables to premidazolam control values. In 4 animals with morphine-induced respiratory depression, intravenous ZK 93426 failed to antagonize the respiratory effects of morphine. Administration of intravenous ZK 93426 alone to 4 pentobarbital-anesthetized animals also failed to produce significant changes in cardiorespiratory activity. We conclude that ZK 93426 is effective in counteracting the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of midazolam and that these effects appear to be specific. The present data suggest that this compound may be useful for the treatment of benzodiazepine oversedation and overdose.", 
    "2": "Quinine, a cinchona alkaloid, was investigated for putative anxiogenic activity in view of clinical reports suggesting that it induces anxiety and apprehension following its use in malaria. The experimental paradigms chosen to elucidate anxiogenic activity have been shown to stand the tests of reliability and validity. Yohimbine, which has been shown to induce anxiety both in animals and in man, was used for comparison. Quinine was found to elicit a complex behavioural profile of activity ranging from overt central stimulation to marked central depression on dose increment. The doses 10 and 20 mg/kg, ip, of quinine chosen to investigate anxiogenic activity were comparable to those induced by 2.5 and 5 mg/kg ip of yohimbine. Quinine induced a dose-related anxiogenic activity in the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests in mice, and the social interaction and thirst conflict tests in rats, similar to effects induced by yohimbine. In addition, both quinine and yohimbine attenuated the effects of diazepam, an anxiolytic agent, in the open-field and thirst conflict tests. The results indicate that quinine exerts significant anxiogenic effect at a particular dose range.", 
    "3": "The Transport and Road Research Laboratory has been concerned for a long time with possible causes of driving difficulties and has developed methods for investigating driving performance. The question addressed here was how applicable these methods are in assessing driving problems arising from the use of drugs which can impair performance, particularly widely-available centrally-acting drugs. We assessed four types of driving-related tests by comparing their sensitivities with two laboratory tests, developed elsewhere, which measure more basic effects of drugs on performance, using drugs known to impair skills. Performances under the influences of ethanol, the benzodiazepine lorazepam, and the antihistamine triprolidine, each given both as a single high dose and a single low dose, were compared with performances after placebo. We used double-blind crossover design, in which subject variability was minimized by studying only women of a limited age range (45-55 y). The driving-related tests detected the effects of the substances used, although they were generally less sensitive than the laboratory tests. The individual sensitivities of the driving test could be improved to match those used for more general assessments.", 
    "4": "Cervical ripening in induced labor at second trimester of pregnancy was studied in 81 cases. The method consisted of injecting diazepam gel through Foley's catheter, into the extra-amniotic space, and at the level of cervical internal os. The cervix was found to be softened, the time interval between induction and onset of labor shortened and there was no cervical laceration. A comparison between the experimental and control groups showed significant difference. The use of suppositories for cervical dilatation in 719 cases of induced abortion and 34 cases of insertion and/or removal of IUD was also studied. The results were satisfactory. The mechanism of cervical dilatation and ripening with drug had been investigated at different periods of pregnancy and in non-pregnant women as well.", 
    "5": "The anxiogenic effects of yohimbine, a specific alpha-2-receptor antagonist were examined by administering 20 mg yohimbine orally to 8 panic patients on placebo treatment, 7 panic patients on alprazolam treatment and 12 controls using a double-blind randomized design, instructions that minimized the expectancy of experiencing a panic attack and two additional structured situations. Yohimbine induced more pronounced increases in anxiety and panicky ratings, norepinephrine secretion, maximum heart rate and high heart rate variability and decreases in skin temperature in panic patients compared with controls. However, possibly owing to an instructional set and experimental design that distracted patients from unpleasant bodily sensations no panic attacks were observed.", 
    "6": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) interact with two classes of high affinity binding sites, equilibrium dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, a neuronal or central-type and a non-neuronal or peripheral-type. The peripheral-type binding site has been shown to be present on the outer mitochondrial membrane and appears to be involved in regulation of cholesterol transport in steroid hormone-producing endocrine cells. In rat pituitary GH3 cells, BZs bind to receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and via interaction at a different site block Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive channels. These, however, are low affinity interactions occurring at micromolar BZ concentrations. Here, using [3H]Ro 5-4864, we report that GH3 cells also have high affinity peripheral-type BZ binding sites. Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants of 7.8 +/- 1.7 nM and 9.3 +/- 4.5 nM for [3H]Ro 5-4864 were measured with intact cells and isolated mitochondria, respectively. As predicted from studies of these sites in other cells, the order of potencies of BZs to displace [3H]Ro 5-4864 was Ro 5-4864 greater than diazepam (DZP) much greater than clonazepam (CIZP); chlordiazepoxide (CDE) did not affect binding. Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine antagonist of Ca2+ channels that has been shown to displace BZs from peripheral-type sites in other cells, was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding with a half-effective concentration in the micromolar range. Ro 5-4864, however, had no effect on Ca2+ influx or efflux in mitochondria isolated from GH3 cells. Hence, GH3 cells exhibit mitochondrial, peripheral-type BZ binding sites but the role of these putative receptors in these neuroendocrine cells, which do not produce steroid hormones, is unclear.", 
    "7": "While hair has for sometime been analyzed for assessment of trace elements, it is only in recent years that attention has been focused on this matrix as a possible means of evaluating drug impregnation. This technique was applied to treated subjects and drug abusers for determination of drug consumation. The method involved decontamination in ethanol, solubilization in sodium hydroxide at 100 degrees C for 10 min, extraction in chloroform/isopropanol/n-heptane (50:17:33, v/v), separation on a BP-5 capillary column (GC) and detection by mass spectrometry. Hair samples were analysed for barbiturates, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, nicotine, opiates, benzoylecgonine, cannabis and amphetamines.", 
    "8": "A retrospective study was carried out, over a twelve-year period, of all cases of acute chloroquine poisoning where more than 2 g of chloroquine had been taken. It included 386 patients; of these, 60 who had taken drugs other than chloroquine, and 17 who had ingested less than 1 g of the drug, were excluded. The remaining 309 patients were allocated to two groups: a \"control group\", consisting of the patients admitted between January 1973 and April 1980 (n = 146), and a \"diazepam group\", made up of those admitted from May 1980 to December 1989 (n = 163). The patients in the latter group had had the same symptomatic treatment as those in the control group, and had been routinely given a 0.5 mg.kg-1 bolus of diazepam on admission followed by 0.1 mg.kg-1.day-1 for every 100 mg of chloroquine supposed to have been ingested. Both groups were divided into three subgroups, those patients with cardiorespiratory arrest, and those with, and those without, symptoms on admission. No statistically significant difference was found between either the control and diazepam groups or between subgroups, concerning the distribution of age, sex, amount of chloroquine supposed to have been ingested, delay in hospital admission and death rate. However, there was a higher death rate in the asymptomatic subgroup not treated with diazepam than in the diazepam group. Therefore, the routine use of diazepam for the treatment of acute chloroquine poisoning does not seem to be justified in symptomatic cases and in those with inaugural cardiac arrest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "The effects of diazepam and the incidence of hypoxaemia on the course of acute chloroquine poisoning were studied prospectively in 21 patients. Were excluded patients who had ingested more than one drug or who had major symptoms on admission (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg; QRS greater than 0.12 s; cardiac dysrhythmias, respiratory disturbances). Arterial blood gases were measured on admission (T0) and 15 min after 0.5 mg.kg-1 of diazepam had been given (T1). Gastric lavage was carried out as soon as the results of the blood gases had been obtained, and after treatment of hypoxaemia (PaO2 less than 90 mmHg). An infusion of diazepam (1 mg.kg-1.day-1) was then given. Arterial blood gases were measured after 1 (T2), 6 (T3), 12 (T4) and 24 h (T5). Hypoxaemia was present on admission in four patients who had a PaO2 = 75 +/- 10 mmHg (Pa(sys) = 130 +/- 19 mmHg; blood chloroquine concentration = 8.2 +/- 5.2 mumol.l-1; kaliemia = 3.1 +/- 0.3 mmol.l-1; PaCO2 = 35 +/- 1 mmHg). In two patients, hypoxaemia decreased after the initial dose of diazepam (T1); however, oxygen was still required by the other two at that time. Oxygen was no longer needed by any patient at T2, as all the blood gas values had returned to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Pirenzepine, an M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist, was tested for its ability to antagonize sham feeding- and intraduodenal fatty meal-stimulated gallbladder contraction in man. Intravenously administered pirenzepine abolished sham feeding-induced gallbladder contraction. Pirenzepine also inhibited contraction induced by intraduodenal meal, but this inhibition was of a lesser magnitude than the inhibition of sham feeding-induced contraction. The results demonstrate that the cephalic phase of gallbladder contraction is probably mediated by M1 muscarinic receptors while the duodenal phase of gallbladder contraction is partially mediated by M1 receptors.", 
    "11": "The metabolism of diazepam has been studied in vitro using microsomal preparations from five human livers. An HPLC method was developed for the assay of diazepam, its congeners and its metabolites. Various methods for the incorporation of diazepam into the incubation medium were explored. It was shown that the use of organic solvents or small quantities of hydrochloric acid enhanced the solubility of this substrate. However all of the organic solvents tested were associated with substantial (around 50%) inhibition of metabolism of diazepam by both major pathways (N-demethylation and C3-hydroxylation). The use of hydrochloric acid gave satisfactory solubilization of diazepam, but not of pinazepam, prazepam or halazepam. Detailed metabolic studies were conducted only for diazepam, using neither hydrochloric acid nor organic solvents in the incubation medium. Formation of N-desmethyl-diazepam increased approximately linearly with diazepam concentration to 200 microM, and did not show saturation. Formation of temazepam gave a curved profile over the same range of diazepam concentrations, suggestive of a sigmoidal relationship. Michaelis-Menten parameters could not be determined for either reaction, but intrinsic clearances for N-demethylation varied over a 6-fold range. Diazepam N-demethylation was apparently promoted by the inclusion of temazepam in the incubation medium, while C3-hydroxylation of diazepam was enhanced in the presence of N-desmethyldiazepam. Mephenytoin in the incubation mixture had no effect on diazepam metabolism by either pathway. The present studies have defined some of the methodological problems inherent in in vitro metabolic studies with benzodiazepines, and have shed further light on the metabolism of diazepam in vitro by human liver.", 
    "12": "A group of 125 healthy young adults was given a memory battery 1 hour after administration of alprazolam (0.5 and 1.0 mg), buspirone (5 and 10 mg), and placebo under single-dose, double-blind conditions. On the wordlist recall battery and a 24-hour retest, alprazolam appeared to impair acquisition and retention in dosages of 1.0 mg; buspirone did not adversely affect test performance at either dosage. On the basis of a 3-stage model of memory, a neuroantomical/neurophysiological model is proposed to explain the selective effects of the benzodiazepines on memory function.",

The author, after referring to the leg muscle bed syndrome associated with exercise, reports the frequency of painful spasticity of the calves, occurring initially at rest and in particular at night in the form of a restless legs syndrome, then secondarily during the day with varying degrees of persistence at rest and during exercise. This problem frequently has a lateral dominance and appears to be induced by self-maintained functional muscular spasticity of the gastrocnemii and soleus, explained by a study. It is frequently attributed to a venous etiology. This study based upon 25 cases enabled definition of the diagnosis and showed the probable links between EMG hyperactivity and a high level of alertness indicative of a predisposing situation.", 
    "14": "We have studied the effects of temazepam, alone and in combination with ethanol, on psychomotor performance in six healthy men and women using a battery of five microcomputer-based tasks before and 30, 90, and 150 min after treatment. The tests were pursuit tracking, divided attention, two four-choice reaction time tests and tapping rate. The entire battery required 25 min. The subjects also reported their mood at each testing time using a computerized bipolar mood scales test. Temazepam (15 mg) plus ethanol (peak blood concentration of 11 mmol.l-1) significantly impaired divided attention, tracking, and reaction time over a 3 h period. There was significant impairment versus placebo for each drug alone on some of the tests. Plasma and urine concentrations of temazepam and temazepam glucuronide were measured, but there was no significant temporal correlation between impairment and drug or metabolite concentration in either plasma or urine. The subjects knew when they had taken ethanol, but could not discriminate temazepam from ethanol whether alone or in combination. The subjects rated their performance similarly after each of the four treatment conditions. The performance on the tracking, divided attention, and PAB reaction time tasks used in this study was impaired by a combination of temazepam and ethanol in doses which may not cause impairment when each is given alone.", 
    "15": "In the last 2 years we had some problems to confirm the thin-layer results (amphetamines, opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and cocaine) with the immunoassay system TDx/ADx. Between January 1989 and December 1990 we did 883 screenings in urine samples (pre- and postmortal) and had 157 discrepancies (20%). In regard of the high level of discrepancies, we had to test the compatibility of TDx and ADx, their detection limits and compared the results with a second method, thin-layer chromatography. Determining the correlation coefficients to prove our results statistically, we found that both systems, TDx and ADx, work reproducible.",

    "19": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are still the main treatment for epilepsy. The first drugs such as the bromides, phenobarbital (PB), and related barbituates were all found to be anticonvulsant by chance. They also all carried to some extent the disadvantages of slowing thinking and motor behavior. Bromides are now seldom used and (PB) is only used when other drugs fail, although it is an important drug in the third world because of its low cost. Carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA), and phenytoin (PHT) are the current first-line AEDs. All of these drugs vary in the extent of their effect on mood. These drugs have also all been used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. CBZ has been used mainly as a mood normalizer and has had some success in treating hypermanic episodes. VPA has been used successfully in the treatment of cyclical psychoses, whereas PHT, although it had a vogue in the 1940s for the treatment of psychosis, is little used as a psychological treatment now.",

Our clinical observations confirm earlier reports. These toxic alopecias are characterized by a diffuse but rarely total hair loss. After stopping medication, the hair grows back generally and completely. Two cases of toxic alopecia are presented where hair grew back following a substitution of lithium by valproate in the first case and after stopping valproate in the second. The evaluation and therapeutic attitude in the presence of alopecia in patients needing mood stabilizers are also discussed.", 
    "21": "In spite of considerable progress in the establishment of physical and psychological treatments for major depression in clinical trials, little is known of the impact of treatment on the prevalence and course of depression in the population. Improved methods for assessing need for care have not yet been applied systematically to such a population. One hundred and thirty men and women attending psychiatric hospitals with depressive disorders were interviewed at the time of their initial contact. After a mean 4-month interval, 119 were reassessed in order to determine the extent to which potentially effective treatments were being fully deployed in those who had not made a complete recovery. Half had made a good recovery. At least 78% of those remaining at threshold level or above apparently had not been offered alternative, potentially effective physical or psychosocial treatment, and were therefore rated as having unmet need. Older male patients were less likely to have unmet need. This study thus raises doubts about the effectiveness of routine clinical management of depression. However, we will remain uncertain of how far the routine falls below the ideal until systematic needs for care procedures (Brewin et al. 1987) are applied prospectively to depressed populations.", 
    "22": "Antinociceptive effects of three centrally acting muscle relaxants, tizanidine, diazepam and eperisone, were studied using an isolated newborn rat spinal cord-tail preparation. Potentials were recorded from a lumbar ventral root (L3-L5) extracellularly using a suction electrode. Pinch stimulation applied to the tail elicited a depolarizing response in the ventral root lasting 15-30 sec, referred to as the tail-pinch potential. Electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral dorsal root of the same segment with a single shock induced depolarizing responses in the ventral root. The responses consisted of monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes with a fast time course, followed by a slow depolarizing response lasting about 20 sec. The latter slow response was designated the ipsilateral slow ventral root potential (VRP). Both the tail-pinch potential and the ipsilateral slow VRP were depressed by application to the spinal cord of tizanidine (2-3 microM), diazepam (2 microM) and eperisone (100-200 microM). The effect of tizanidine was reversed by alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonists, yohimbine and idazoxan, but not by an alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin. The effect of diazepam was reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil.", 
    "23": "The protective effect of ferrocene carbamate pretreatment against soman poisoning was studied in guinea pigs. At doses corresponding to 1/20 x and 1/10 x LD50 of this carbamate a 20% and 45% decrease of the acetylcholinesterase in blood and brain, respectively, was obtained. In combination with additional pretreatment, diazepam, and therapy, HI-6 and atropine, the protective ratios (LD50 of soman in treated animals/LD50 of soman in untreated animals) were around 20 and 40, respectively. Animals pretreated with the high dose of the ferrocene carbamate that survived 10 x and 15 x LD50s of soman showed no remaining signs of poisoning after 24 h. Thus, the ferrocene carbamate afforded a better protection against soman than physostigmine. The explanation for this could be due to the properties of the ferrocene carbamate, not correlated to its cholinesterase inhibiting activity. This hypothesis is discussed.",

    "31": "Selective muscarinic receptor antagonists were used to identify muscarinic receptor subtypes in equine trachealis strips. The M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (10(-7) mol/L to 3 x 10(-5) mol/L) and the M3 receptor antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP, 10(-9) mol/L to 3 x 10(-7) mol/L3) dose dependently inhibited the contractile responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) and exogenous acetylcholine (ACh). Schild plots yielded a pA2 value for pirenzepine vs ACh of 6.75 +/- 0.09, which is consistent with the affinity for M2 or M3 receptors, and a pA2 value for 4-DAMP vs ACh of 8.47 +/- 0.09, which is in agreement with the affinity for M3 receptors. The M2 receptor antagonist gallamine (10(-5) mol/L and 10(-4) mol/L) did not affect the response of trachealis to exogenous ACh and low-frequency EFS (0.1-2 Hz) but decreased the responses to high-frequency EFS (4-16 Hz). These results suggest that the muscarinic receptors mediating contractions induced by ACh in equine tracheal smooth muscle are of the M3 subtype. The lack of an increase in the response to EFS following gallamine suggests that functional prejunctional inhibitory M2 receptors are not present on the cholinergic nerves innervating equine tracheal smooth muscle.",

It is suggested that in situ ESWL is effective in the treatment of stones in mid ureter as well as those in upper and lower ureter.", 
    "33": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of flumazenil on local anesthetic-induced acute toxicity. For each of the three tested anesthetics (etidocaine, mepivacaine and lidocaine) 6 groups of mice were treated by a single dose of flumazenil (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg), or an equal volume of saline, 15 minutes before the injection of the anesthetic (etidocaine: 50 mg/kg, mepivacaine: 110 mg/kg and lidocaine: 115 mg/kg). The convulsant activity, the time of latency to convulse and the mortality rate were assessed in each group. The local anesthetic-induced mortality was not significantly modified by flumazenil. The convulsant activity of lidocaine and mepivacaine was significantly increased by flumazenil but not for etidocaine. Also, increasing doses of flumazenil decreased the time of latency to obtain lidocaine-induced convulsions. This effect was not obtained with etidocaine or mepivacaine.", 
    "34": "One hundred and twenty-three male children, aged one to ten years, were studied to determine the influence of premedication on changes in patterns of behaviour following hospitalization for repair of inguinal hernias. Four comparable groups were selected for premedication regimen: (1) A control group without premedication; (2) oral trimeprazine tartrate 2 mg/kg, methadone 0.1 mg/kg and droperidol 0.15 mg/kg; (3) oral midazolam 0.45 mg/kg; (4) intramuscular midazolam 0.15 mg/kg. Standard inhalational anesthesia was used and caudal blocks employed for analgesia. The parents returned a questionnaire at two weeks. Changes in behaviour were reported in 78% of the children and overall, premedication showed little benefit. However, midazolam premedication was associated with a significantly lower incidence of night-time crying and awakening, compared with no premedication. Only for night-time crying and day-time toilet training did age below five years prove to be a significant contributing factor.",

Onset at age 76, association with insomnia and a rapid course leading to death within 2 years were the characteristic features. CSF data, electromyographic and immunological findings suggest abnormalities of catecholaminergic and GABA ergic systems, with release of segmental or suprasegmental inhibitory influence. The presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, considered a useful marker of this syndrome, raises the possibility of an autoimmune pathogenesis.", 
    "36": "Twenty-six adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery were anaesthetized with diazepam and fentanyl (induction with 200 micrograms.kg-1 and 30 micrograms.kg-1 respectively, maintenance with incremental doses). Normothermic constant perfusion output cardiopulmonary bypass was carried out with a membrane oxygenator, haemodilution with Ringer's lactate solution, and cardioplegia with St. Thomas's Hospital solution. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups. They were given either 2 mg.kg-1 of ketamine (group 1) or placebo (5 ml of normal saline) (group 2) via the venous line of the oxygenator. The non pulsatile flow was then kept at a steady rate of 2.41 x min-1.m-2, and no other infusion or treatment was started during the study period (ten minutes). The mean arterial pressure and blood reservoir level were measured every min during this period. The systemic vascular resistances did not change significantly in either group, but remained 27% lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). The blood reservoir level was 37% higher in the ketamine group (p less than 0.01), suggesting a decreased venous capacitance. It is therefore concluded that ketamine leads to venous constriction, and probably arterial dilation, during fentanyl-diazepam anaesthesia and normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. The venous effects of ketamine could explain why it is usually well tolerated in hypovolaemic states.", 
    "37": "The effects of diazepam and thiopental on voluntary saccades and pursuit eye movements were tested in 9 volunteers, with an interval of at least 2 weeks between tests. One, 4 and 8 h after intravenous injection of diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) or thiopental (6.0 mg/kg), voluntary saccades and pursuit eye movements were tested and blood samples taken for analysis of drug concentration. As compared to results of tests without drugs, a significant reduction both of saccadic peak velocity and gain of pursuit eye movements was found 1 h after injection of either drug, but not after 4 and 8 h. The amplitude of saccades elicited with the 60 degrees stimulus was significantly reduced 1 h after injection of diazepam. Latency of saccades increased significantly up to 4 h after injection of either drug. No significant correlation was found between peak velocity of saccades and blood concentration of either thiopental or diazepam 1 h after administration. The present results confirm that in man saccades and pursuit eye movements are reduced by benzodiazepines and barbiturates, but provide no support for the previously described efficacy of saccades in monitoring the effect of benzodiazepines. It is hypothesized that diazepam and thiopental also induce reduction of voluntary saccades and pursuit eye movements via a general sedation of the central nervous system (CNS), besides having specific effects on CNS structures important to the performance of voluntary eye movements.", 
    "38": "Basing on clinical studies of anesthesia in 568 children, central hemodynamic studies, analysis of the blood acid-base balance and gases, glycemia level, and assessment of the psychoneurologic status, the authors validate the usefulness of calypsol-based anesthesia in practical outpatient pedodontics. Such anesthesia did not influence the stability of central hemodynamics parameters, nor did it change the acid-base balance and blood sugar level; it provided an adequate protection of the patient from surgical stress with the adaptation mechanisms remaining intact. The child may leave the clinic 2.5-3 h after the intervention and a test for adequate adaptation to the environment. Calypsol-based balanced anesthesia improves outpatient care of the children, introduction of this method into practice will bring about a good economic effect.", 
    "39": "In order to study the influence of diazepam on both cholinergistic and non-cholinergistic (stressogenic) effects of phosphororganic insecticide dichlorovos, both the activity of cholinesterase in selected organs and blood as well as biochemical markers of stress (plasma corticosterone, tyrosine aminotransferase activity in the liver) have been applied. Comparing the course of diazepam-treated and untreated dichlorovos intoxication, cholinesterases showed greater increase in inhibition in the first case. There was smaller decrease in activity of acetylcholinesterase in CNS and diaphragm compared with untreated intoxication. Although the changes of plasma corticosterone level were entirely corresponding to those of untreated intoxication, there was still greater increase in activity of tyrosine aminotransferase when compared with untreated intoxication. A marked increase in activity of tyrosine aminotransferase is more convenient for an intoxicated organism, because tyrosine aminotransferase stimulates gluconeogenesis. Even in absence of a complete elimination of cholinergistic and stressogenic effects of dichlorovos, diazepam, as a drug, influenced markedly their course. Thus its significance of component of a complexive atropine-oxime therapy of the intoxication with organophosphates appears to be undiscussible and wider than stressed usually.", 
    "40": "Gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are invasive and carry a significant morbidity and mortality, even for diagnostic procedures (mortality of 1 in 2000 for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy). The commonest causes of death are cardiopulmonary complications, which may in part be related to sedative techniques. The clinical end-points for sedation need to be reappraised and should aim to induce amnesia rather than hypnosis. Endoscopists need to be familiar with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the benzodiazepines used for sedation. This applies particularly to the protracted half-lives of some benzodiazepines and the major drug interaction with significant synergy that occurs if opioids are used in combination with benzodiazepines. Thus appropriate doses of these drugs should be administered. The use of supplemental oxygen and pulse oximetry, combined with continuous intravenous access during the procedure should be standard practice. Endoscopists should be aware of national guidelines for safe endoscopic practice.", 
    "41": "The performance of Tween 80, Tween 60, oleic acid, oleyl alcohol and Azone as enhancers of clonazepam permeation from a Carbopol hydrogel through a cellulose nitrate membrane was investigated. The effect of incorporating methyl beta-cyclodextrin (DS 1.8) in combination with clonazepam as a solid phase into some vehicles was also tested. In vitro release studies were carried out with a Sartorius apparatus and the following parameters were evaluated: drug solubility in the vehicle; partition coefficient of the drug between lauryl alcohol (the solvent which impregnates the membrane) and the vehicle; steady state flux; permeability constant; diffusion coefficient; lag time. The release kinetics followed a nearly zero-order pattern, although the diffusion-controlled mechanism might also have been operative. Maximum drug release (2.5 times that of the gel base) was achieved for the formulation containing clonazepam and methyl beta-cyclodextrin in a 1:1 (mol/mol) ratio as a solid phase, in a vehicle composed of water, propylene glycol, Tween 80 and Azone at a mass fraction of 43%, 50%, 2% and 5%, respectively.", 
    "42": "Numerous experimental data obtained in the studies of factors influencing the transfer of model drugs (diazepam, inulin, hippurate) into the lymphatic system were evaluated using compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The selection of kinetic equations for lymphatic data analysis in respect to blood ones is specific. Lymphatic kinetic equations correspond in every case tested with those used generally in blood kinetic analysis of drugs administered perorally. The lag time parameter is useful in this lymphatic analysis, too.", 
    "43": "A study was conducted to evaluate repeated intrathecal injections of baclofen, without artificial ventilation, in the treatment of severe tetanus. Ten patients, 5 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 34 +/- 7 years, were included in the study. The dose of baclofen injected was 1000 micrograms between the ages of 16 and 55 years, 800 micrograms over the age of 55 years and 500 micrograms under the age of 16 years. The efficacy was assessed on the basis of the resolution of contractures and paroxysms and the initial dose was reinjected prior to the reappearance of these symptoms. Treatment was discontinued in the case of central nervous system depression or inefficacy. The first injection was effective in 9 cases for 24-48 h. The haemodynamic safety was always good. Five patients developed central depression with coma and respiratory depression, requiring artificial ventilation in 3 cases and reversed by flumazenil in 2 cases. Five patients were treated exclusively with baclofen with 4 cures. Five patients had to be ventilated with only one cure. This study confirms earlier studies concerning the efficacy of intrathecal baclofen in tetanus. However, the frequency of episodes of respiratory depression prevents the recommendation of repeated injections when respiratory intensive care facilities are not available.", 
    "44": "The accelerating rotarod was used to assess motor performance decrement in rats after administration of candidate anticonvulsant compounds (acetazolamide, amitriptyline, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, diazepam-lysine, lorazepam, loprazolam, midazolam, phenobarbital and scopolamine) against nerve agent poisoning. All compounds were tested as the commercially available injectable preparation except for diazepam-lysine and loprazolam, which are not FDA approved. A peak effect time, as well as a dose to decrease performance time by 50% from control (PDD50), was determined. The calculated PDD50 (mumol/kg) values and peak effect times were midazolam, 1.16 at 15 min; loprazolam, 1.17 at 15 min; diazepam-lysine, 4.17 at 30 min; lorazepam, 4.98 at 15 min; diazepam, 5.27 at 15 min; phenobarbital, 101.49 at 45 min; chlordiazepoxide, 159.21 at 30 min; scopolamine, amitriptyline and acetazolamide did not demonstrate a performance decrement at any of the doses tested. The PDD50 values were compared with doses which have been utilized against nerve agent-induced convulsions or published ED50 values from standard anticonvulsant screening tests (maximal electroshock [MES] and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol [scMET]). The results suggest that at anticonvulsant doses against nerve agents, all the benzodiazepines and phenobarbital have the potential to cause a performance decrement, whereas candidate anticonvulsants of the non-benzodiazepine or non-barbiturate type would not be expected to demonstrate this effect on motor performance. It is concluded that compounds such as acetazolamide, amitriptyline and scopolamine offer alternatives to the highly decrementing benzodiazepines and phenobarbital and should be further tested as anticonvulsant candidates against nerve agent intoxication.",

Four patients had DSM-III-R bipolar disorder, mixed, and one had cyclothymic disorder as diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). All cases of bipolar disorder manifested rapid cycling. Three patients with bipolar disorder experienced onset of this illness soon after the onset of cervicocranial dystonia (5 neck dystonia, 4 craniofacial, 2 brachial, 1 vocal cord, 1 thoracic). These cases apparently represent a first report of bipolar disorders in dystonia. Clinical management, relevant literature, and putative neurobiology are reviewed.", 
    "47": "Intensive therapy of a patient with status asthmaticus must lead to a reduction of vital threat by improving respiratory and cardiac functions. Because of the bronchodilating effect of ketamine, analgesic sedation with ketamine and benzodiazepines is extremely useful for prolonged ventilation. At the beginning of this treatment it can be necessary to supplement the continuous intravenous infusion of ketamine and diazepam or ketamine and midazolam with small bolus doses of up to 3.5 mg/kg/h of ketamine. Experience has shown that the combination of ketamine and midazolam has better controllability. In some of our patients the bronchodilating effect of ketamine was not sufficient and therefore ventilation with halothane was necessary at least intermittently. In contrast to halothane, ketamine can be combined with vasodilators and sympathomimetics as our own experience has shown. The combined application of ketamine with glycerol trinitrate or sodium nitroprusside is indicated in the event of pulmonary or general hypertension. The use of sympathomimetics--mainly beta-sympathomimetics--antagonizes the negative inotropic effect of ketamine, improves the circulatory system and leads to a direct bronchodilating effect. Progress in treatment was mainly achieved by continuous intravenous infusions of terbutaline (Bricanyl). Aminophylline is very compatible with ketamine, but because of its stimulating effect the use of aminophylline seems to be reasonable only during weaning from the ventilator. Control of the usually deep analgesic sedation and an accompanying optimum drug therapy are only possible with complete cardiorespiratory monitoring including invasive blood pressure measurement and catheterization of the pulmonary artery. In our clinic 24 patients with status asthmaticus were treated. Sixteen asthmatic patients were treated with analgesic sedation using ketamine and benzodiazepines, three of them without intubation and ventilation. In spite of the life-threatening situation and reanimation before admission to the intensive care unit, only one patient died. Our experience has shown that intensive therapy including analgesic sedation with ketamine and benzodiazepines, optimized by application of sympathomimetics and vasodilators, is suitable for overcoming the life-threatening situation of patients with status asthmaticus.", 
    "48": "Rebound insomnia was studied in subjects, aged 25-50 years, with insomnia complaints and normal sleep, insomnia complaints and disturbed sleep, and normal sleep with no complaints (N = 21, n = 7 per group). Standard sleep recordings were collected on a baseline night and after abrupt discontinuation of 6 nights of 0.50 mg triazolam, tapered discontinuation (3 nights of 0.50 mg, 2 nights of 0.25 mg, and 1 night of 0.125 mg triazolam) and 6 nights of placebo. Significantly disturbed sleep on the discontinuation night compared to the baseline night was found. The relative degree of rebound insomnia was greater in the abrupt condition than in either the tapered or placebo conditions. The tapered condition reduced sleep time by half that of the abrupt condition which was twice the reduction found in the placebo condition. An overall (regardless of group or condition) difference in baseline versus discontinuation sleep was found, suggesting that pill discontinuation itself leads to sleep disturbance. Subjects did not differ in rebound insomnia as a function of pre-existing sleep disturbance.", 
    "49": "The effect of infantile handling-stimulation and/or perinatal flumazenil (3.7 mg/kg/day) administration on exploratory and emotional-related behavior was investigated using Roman high- and low-avoidance (RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh) rats. Postnatal handling increased exploration in 30-day-old rats of both psychogenetically selected lines when they were exposed to a hexagonal tunnel maze including an illuminated central arena. Likewise, postnatal stimulation decreased emotional reactivity in both lines of rats, as expressed by increased entry into the central arena, decreased defecation and vocalization frequency, but these effects were more pronounced in the RLA/Verh line. There were interactions between perinatal flumazenil treatment and rat line, indicating that flumazenil enhanced entry into the maze central arena in handled-RLA/Verh rats, whereas a tendency toward the opposite effect was observed in drug-treated and handled-RHA/Verh animals. Thus, the present study emphasizes that the effects of environmental manipulations are partly dependent upon genetic factors, and that pharmacological effects also depend on both genetic and environmentally-induced predisposition.", 
    "50": "This study sought to determine whether the place learning deficits produced by diazepam are a secondary result of opioid release. Rats pretreated with diazepam (3 mg/kg) or morphine (15 mg/kg) were trained in the Morris water maze. Diazepam impaired place learning-slowing acquisition and preventing the formation of a quadrant preference. Morphine also slowed acquisition, but did not prevent place learning, and impaired escape to a visible platform. Flumazenil blocked the deficits produced by diazepam, but not morphine. Naloxone (2 mg/kg) blocked the deficits produced by morphine, but not diazepam. A high dose of naloxone (10 mg/kg) slowed acquisition, and exacerbated the deficit produced by diazepam. These results demonstrate that diazepam interferes with mnemonic processes through endogenous benzodiazepine receptors, independently of opioidergic systems. Further, they suggest that morphine interferes with motivational processes through opioidergic systems, independently of endogenous benzodiazepine systems.", 
    "51": "Four antiepileptic drugs were investigated in an inhibitory avoidance task in mice. Following IP administration 30 min prior to training, carbamazepine (32 mg/kg), phenytoin (30-60 mg/kg), diazepam (2-8 mg/kg) and clonazepam (0.125-0.5 mg/kg) impaired retention. When administered 30 min prior to the retention test none of the drugs under investigation affected retention. The drugs did not affect latencies in the hot plate test. This indicates that in the case of pretraining drug administration effects on retention cannot attributed to elevated pain thresholds. Carbamazepine and phenytoin impaired avoidance learning at doses above those which prevent electroshock induced tonic hindlimb convulsions. Diazepam and clonazepam were effective at lower than anticonvulsant doses. The results of the study are relevant to the evaluation of CNS side effects of anti-epileptic drugs in mice.", 
    "52": "In order to perform a nonlinear dimensional analysis of the sleep EEG, we applied an algorithm proposed to calculate the correlation dimension D2 of different sleep stages. D2 characterizes the dynamics of the sleep EEG, estimates the degrees of freedom, and describes the complexity of the signal under study. An attempt is made to correlate dimensionality analysis and informational aspects of the sleep EEG. Information processing by the brain during different sleep stages of healthy subjects under the influence of lorazepam and in unmedicated acute schizophrenics is estimated.", 
    "53": "The residual effects of hypnotics were investigated with a long-acting (nitrazepam) and a short-acting (triazolam) benzodiazepine hypnotic in 8 male volunteers. Subjects received placebo, nitrazepam 5 mg, or triazolam 0.25 mg for 7 consecutive nights in a random-order, double-blind crossover design. Daytime sleepiness, psychomotor performance, EEG activity and standing steadiness were assessed in the morning after 1, 4, and 7 days of drug treatment. Plasma concentrations of nitrazepam and triazolam were also assayed. The concentration of nitrazepam increased gradually during the course of treatment and was associated with residual sedative effects on days 4 and 7. Nitrazepam produced no apparent psychomotor impairments in these studies. On the other hand, there was no evidence of drug accumulation after triazolam administration and triazolam showed no residual sedative effects or residual impairment of psychomotor performance during the experiment. Thus, short-acting hypnotics may have an advantage over long-acting hypnotics in terms of producing less residual sedative effects during chronic treatment.", 
    "54": "1. This study was designed to determine the involvement of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the gastric secretory responses to exogenous and endogenous secretagogues in conscious dogs with chronic gastric fistulae (GF), pancreatic fistulae (PF) and Heidenhain pouches (HP). 2. A meal of meat or intragastric application of peptone (300 mosM) increased secretion of HCl from the HP and pancreatic secretion of protein and plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and somatostatin. 3. The CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718 caused a further increase in the postprandial HCl secretion from the HP and in the plasma levels of gastrin and CCK but pancreatic output of protein and plasma concentration of somatostatin were significantly reduced. 4. Addition to intragastric peptone of 10% oleate or its acidification to pH 3.0 profoundly inhibited the HP secretion and gastrin release but significantly increased pancreatic secretion of protein and plasma levels of CCK and somatostatin. Administration of L-364,718 reversed the fall in the HP secretion and plasma gastrin while significantly attenuating pancreatic protein secretion and plasma somatostatin levels. 5. Intragastric administration of hyperosmolar (1200 mosM) peptone also inhibited HCl secretion from the HP but this was not affected by L-364,718. 6. Exogenous CCK and bombesin (but not gastrin) caused a small increase in HCl secretion from the HP and marked stimulation of pancreatic protein secretion accompanied by a significant rise in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and somatostatin. Administration of L-364,718 resulted in a further increase in the HCl response of HP to bombesin and in plasma levels of gastrin and CCK but caused a reduction in plasma levels of somatostatin. 7. We conclude that CCK released by a meal of meat, intragastric peptone, oleate or acidified peptone and intravenous bombesin exerts tonic inhibitory influences on gastric acid secretion and that this effect is mediated, at least in part, by somatostatin.", 
    "55": "Benzodiazepine hypnotic medications are widely prescribed for elderly patients, but there is a paucity of information available concerning the residual cognitive and psychomotor (the morning-after) effects of these drugs. We compared two commonly used hypnotics--temazepam and triazolam--in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study with community-dwelling healthy elderly with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of primary insomnia. Forty-five subjects over the age of 65 (mean age 72.23, SD = 4.44) qualified for the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups (placebo, triazolam 0.125 mg., triazolam 0.25 mg., temazepam 15 mg., and temazepam 30 mg.). Neuropsychological testing was completed at baseline and 12-14 hours after the dosing. Patients were evaluated with a variety of tests that measured attention, concentration, motor speed, immediate memory, and learning of new information. Separate repeated measured analyses of variance were performed to assess the significant changes among the five treatment groups. We found improved performance or no change in all the measures for all medication groups except for impairment of performance on a serial learning task for both high-dose medication groups. The significance of these results and the need for further research in elderly insomniacs is discussed.",

These patients had a high urinary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol 24 h-excretion and normal plasma lactate levels. Both drugs were efficient as anti-panic agents, but clonazepam resulted more efficacious than imipramine by the scores of Hamilton Anxiety or Depression Scales. Moreover, clonazepam also reduced the anticipatory anxiety.", 
    "57": "Benzodiazepine agonists in combination with opioid analgesics are commonly used for combined analgesia and sedation in intensive care patients as well as for anesthesia. In animals, studies indicate either agonistic or antagonistic interactions of benzodiazepine agonists and opioids. This retrospective study of 43 patients evaluated the possible clinical relevance of benzodiazepine-opioid interactions related to pain management. We observed an increase of greater than 50% of the maximal sufentanil infusion rate in significantly more patients in group 2 (13 patients vs 6 patients; chi 2: p = 0.04) and a decrease of the sufentanil infusion rate in eight group 1 patients, but only in one patient in group 2 (chi 2: p = 0.03). We believe that an interaction between midazolam and sufentanil on nociceptive transmission and/or a rapid development of tolerance to sufentanil may be responsible for the observed difference. Contrary to the common clinical impression that midazolam potentiates opioid analgesia, these results indicate that systemic co-administration of midazolam over a period of more than three days can diminish sufentanil efficacy.", 
    "58": "Single-channel recordings of GABAA receptor single-channel currents have been obtained from mouse spinal cord neurons in cell culture. Detailed kinetic analysis of single-channel main-conductance level currents has allowed development of a preliminary kinetic scheme which describes the gating of the GABAA receptor channel. The essential features of this kinetic scheme are presented in scheme 1 (see above). In this scheme, the GABAA receptor channel is envisioned to exist in multiple open and closed states. Properties can be broken into three main categories. First, the receptor can exist in a closed and nondesensitized set of states. In the kinetic model it is envisioned that there is an unbound (C13), a singly bound (C12), and two doubly bound (C11 and C10) closed states. The singly bound and doubly bound closed states are thought to open to three open states (O1, O2, O3). However, each of the open states opens to two distal closed states whose kinetic properties are similar for all three open states (C4-C9). Only one desensitized state (D0) has been incorporated into the model. While this characterization of desensitization is certainly incomplete, it is an initial step toward including the desensitization process which is clearly evident in whole-cell and single-channel recordings. This kinetic scheme should be considered only an initial working model. A number of features appear to be correct. First, all analyses of open time frequency histograms for GABA- and GABA agonist-induced single-channel openings have demonstrated the presence of at least three distinct open time constants. Furthermore, the concentration-dependent change in the relative frequency of occurrence of the three open states suggests that the open states occur from singly and doubly bound forms of the receptor. Second, the presence of two brief closed states adjacent to the open states appears fairly secure. However, it should be noted that the kinetic analysis primarily suggests that each open state opens to two brief adjacent closed states in a concentration-independent manner. While we have indicated that these two closed states are distal to the three open states, the actual assignment of the location of these states is unclear. Another interpretation of these data is that there is only a single distal closed state and that the proximal, extraburst closed states have very brief durations that are similar to each other. What appears clear, however, is that the open states can close to either brief closed state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) and withdrawal seizure resistant (WSR) mice were treated with 5 mg/kg lorazepam for 7 days via implanted osmotic mini pumps. Following chronic drug treatment, brains were assayed for GABA-mediated chloride flux (GABA-Cl-). Under control (drug naive) conditions, brain membranes prepared from WSP and WSR lines did not differ in flunitrazepam or ethanol stimulation of GABA-mediated 36Cl- uptake, but the WSP lines were more sensitive to inhibition of 36Cl- flux by the inverse agonist, FG-7142. Membranes from lorazepam tolerant WSP and WSR mice were resistant to flunitrazepam- and ethanol-stimulation of GABA-Cl-. Withdrawal from chronic treatment, by an acute injection with the benzodiazepine antagonist RO15-1788, returned flunitrazepam stimulation of GABA-Cl- to near control levels in WSR membranes but not in WSP membranes and restored ethanol modulation of the channel to control levels in both lines. Inhibition of chloride flux by the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, FG-7142 was greater in membranes from WSP mice compared with WSR mice. Tolerance to lorazepam increased sensitivity of the WSR membranes to FG-7142 without altering the response in the WSP line. Again, withdrawal restored the Cl- flux response to FG-7142 back to near control levels. Lorazepam tolerance lowered [3H]-flunitrazepam binding affinity slightly only in the WSR strain with no change in binding number. Withdrawal from chronic lorazepam treatment produced no significant change in binding affinity or number. The initial genotypic differences in benzodiazepine inverse agonist sensitivity, may be related to the selection for withdrawal seizure severity. Chronic administration of lorazepam reduces the coupling between the benzodiazepine agonist site and the chloride channel and concomitantly increases coupling between the channel and the inverse agonist site, while withdrawal resets the receptor coupling back to control response levels. However, for the WSP line, this drug environment dependent shift in channel coupling bias appears to be deficient compared with the WSR line.", 
    "60": "This study was undertaken to clarify the role of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) in induction of pancreatic growth stimulated by a high protein diet. Rats with i.v. jugular cannulae in place and kept in Bollman cages were adapted to 5% casein diet for 9 days and switched to 70% casein for 2 days. MK-329, a CCK receptor antagonist, and SMS 201-995, a somatostatin agonist, were continuously infused at 0.5 mg/kg/h and 5 micrograms/kg/h, respectively, starting at the onset of feeding 70% casein. The 5 and 70% casein control groups were infused with saline. Feeding 70% casein significantly stimulated pancreatic hyperplasia and tissue hypertrophy. MK-329 and SMS 201-995 totally prevented 70% casein-induced increases in pancreatic weight and total RNA and DNA contents. The results indicate that endogenous CCK is the major factor responsible for pancreatic growth induced by a high protein diet.", 
    "61": "The neurotoxic agent lindane was tested for its ability to alter the rate of ultrasonic isolation calls of suckling rats. Doses that did not produce any sign of convulsant activity significantly increased the number of calls and the cumulative time of calling in male pups. At days 10-13 of age after a single dose of 20 mg/kg lindane, animals showed more than twice the control call values. After daily dosing with 10 mg/kg during the first week of age call increases also appeared. It is suggested that lindane has an anxiogenic effect mediated through its action on the benzodiazepine-GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex.", 
    "62": "The efficacy and tolerability of tropisetron in preventing cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting was studied in 2 open trials and compared with the efficacy and tolerability of metoclopramide plus lorazepam in a randomised crossover trial. In the first study, tropisetron 10mg was administered intravenously over 15 minutes before the cisplatin infusion and a second 10mg dose was given after the 60-minute infusion of cisplatin (greater than 50 mg/m2) in 54 patients with advanced cancers, for a total of 165 courses. Good responses for nausea and vomiting were recorded in 83.0% and 87.9% of courses, respectively, with complete protection from nausea and vomiting in 44.8% and 66.1% of courses, respectively. In the second study in 25 patients whose characteristics and cisplatin schedule were comparable with those of the first study, very similar results were achieved in 104 courses of chemotherapy, despite a reduction in tropisetron dose to a single 5mg intravenous infusion 15 minutes before cisplatin. The efficacies of intravenous tropisetron 5mg and metoclopramide 2 mg/kg plus lorazepam administered 15 minutes before cisplatin in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting were compared in a randomised crossover study involving 20 patients. Tropisetron was significantly superior (p less than 0.001) in controlling both acute and delayed (day 1) symptoms. In all studies, the tolerability of tropisetron was excellent. The most frequent side effect was mild to moderate headache, occurring in 5 to 7% of patients. In conclusion, our experience suggests that tropisetron is an effective and well tolerated antiemetic drug that improves the quality of life of cancer patients administered highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.", 
    "63": "Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) currents have been measured in Xenopus oocytes injected with heart RNA purified from 7 day old rats, using voltage clamp technique. The currents were evoked by depolarizing voltage steps, using Ba2+ as charge carrier. Electrophysiological analysis of the current revealed two components: a slow, L-type, dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive current and a transient, DHP-insensitive, current. The benzodiazepine (BZ) ligands diazepam and Ro5-4864 decreased the current with micromolar affinity, with potency order of Ro5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam. The central antagonist Ro15-1788 did not interfere with the effect of these drugs, thus excluding the possible involvement of the \"central type\" receptor. The slow current that was increased about 3 fold in the presence of 0.5 microM Bay K 8644, was less potentiated when previously treated with Ro5-4864 or diazepam. Current-voltage relation of the peak inward current and the steady state activation curve showed a small shift towards negative potentials in the presence of 50 microM diazepam. It is concluded that the benzodiazepine ligands block DHP-sensitive voltage dependent Ca2+ channels with a very marginal effect on the transient, DHP-insensitive current. Also it is emphasized that Xenopus oocytes can serve as a useful model system to study the pharmacology of these important drugs on cardiac Ca2+ channels.", 
    "64": "The comparative effect of truncal vagotomy and associated pyloroplasty and orally administrated pirenzepine (75 mg, 1 h before food intake) on the exocrine pancreatic secretory response to food was studied in conscious dogs. Both pirenzepine administration and truncal vagotomy totally abolished the pancreatic hydromineral and organic secretory response to food intake while postprandial pH of intraduodenal content remained above 6. From the results of our study we conclude that the vago nerve must not be altered in order to assure a pancreatic response to food intake and that pirenzepine is as strong as truncal vagotomy in maintaining pH in postprandial intraduodenal content over 6.", 
    "65": "1. The ability to modify the pain threshold by the two M1-muscarinic agonists: McN-A-343 and AF-102B and by the specific M2-agonist arecaidine was examined in mice and rats by using three different noxious stimuli: chemical (writhing test), thermic (hot-plate test) and mechanical (paw pressure test). 2. In the mouse hot-plate test McN-A-343 (20-50 micrograms per mouse i.c.v.) and AF-102B (1-10 mg kg-1 i.p.) produced significant antinociception which was prevented by atropine (1 microgram per mouse i.c.v.) and by the two selective M1 antagonists: pirenzepine (0.01 micrograms per mouse i.c.v.) and dicyclomine (0.08 micrograms per mouse i.c.v. or 10 mg kg-1 i.p.) but not by the specific M2-antagonist AFDX-116 (0.1 micrograms per mouse i.c.v.), naloxone (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or by the acetylcholine (ACh) depletor hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) (1 micrograms per mouse i.c.v.). McN-A-343 and AF-102B were able to increase the pain threshold also in the mouse acetic acid writhing test and in rat paw pressure test. These antinociceptive effects were completely prevented by dicyclomine (0.08 micrograms per mouse i.c.v. or 10 mg kg-1 i.p.) but not by AFDX-116 (0.1 microgram per mouse or rat i.c.v.). 3. In contrast with the M1-agonists, the M2-agonist arecaidine (0.1-2 micrograms per mouse or rat i.c.v.) did not induce antinociception in all three analgesic tests. However, arecaidine, at the same i.c.v. doses, was able to reduce the pain threshold in the hot-plate and paw pressure tests.4. The site of muscarinic control of the pain threshold is localized in the CNS since drugs which do not cross the blood-brain barrier such as McN-A-343, pirenzepine and arecaidine exerted their effects only if injected i.c.v.5. On the basis of the above findings and existing literature we suggest that the postsynaptic muscarinic receptors involved in antinociception belong to the M1 subtype. Nevertheless, presynaptic autoreceptors (M2 subtype) may play a role in pain regulation since they are involved in modulation of endogenous ACh release.", 
    "66": "The phenomenon of seizure clustering is still poorly understood. We therefore investigated 192 patients with temporal lobe epilepsies among whom 60 showed clustering of seizures. The percentage of women was significantly higher in the cluster than in the non-cluster group, the history of epilepsy lasted longer and the excess of complex partial seizures over tonic clonic seizures was more prominent in the cluster group. In 46 out of the 60 patients the clustering did not occur initially but developed in the course of the disease. In a particular subgroup the development initiated with isolated tonic clonic seizures, in a later phase complex partial seizures appeared and finally only complex partial seizures remained. This type of history was found significantly more frequent in the cluster than in the non-cluster group (27% versus 7%). It is conjectured that endogenous, as well as exogenous factors, both of them not completely revealed, cause the occurrence of clusters; anticonvulsant drug therapy might even enlarge this trend. Patients with seizure clustering tend to be pharmacoresistant. Chronic therapy with antiepileptic drugs besides intermittent therapy with benzodiazepines may help. A particular type of seizure clustering is observed in catamenial epilepsies where seizures appear in the perimenstrual and/or periovulatory phase of the menstrual hormonal cycle of females. This type of seizure incidence is obviously influenced by hormonal rhythms. Ten patients suffering from catamenial epileptic seizures were therefore treated with a synthetic analogue of GnRH in order to suppress the menstrual hormonal rhythm. As a result 3 patients became seizure free and in 5 patients seizure frequency decreased.", 
    "67": "This work focuses on the neurophysiological features in a patient with action myoclonus and mental deterioration following methylbromide intoxication. The patient is a 28-year-old man, without respiratory distress or exposure to other toxics. Myoclonus improved with polytherapy (clonazepam, 5-HT, carbidopa, GABA). The neurophysiological and neuropsychological evidence in this patient suggests a possible double site of action of methylbromide at cortical and subcortical levels.", 
    "68": "The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepines on the electrical activity of cultured frog melanotrophs were studied using the patch-clamp technique. In the cell-attached configuration, the exposure to GABA caused a blockage of the spontaneous firing. In the whole-cell configuration, with physiological chloride concentrations, GABA evoked a hyperpolarization associated with a decrease of membrane resistance, generating an inward chloride current. Clonazepam, a central-type benzodiazepine agonist, potentiated the GABA-induced current and the resulting hyperpolarization. In addition, the benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 19-4603 totally abolished GABA-induced hyperpolarizing chloride current. Since the pars intermedia of the frog pituitary is composed of a 'pure' population of endocrine cells enriched with GABAA receptors, our results indicate that these cells represent a valuable model in which to investigate the electrophysiological effects of ligands for the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "69": "The relationships between self-reported assessments of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep, preoperative anxiety, and several biochemical and physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in pregnant women at term receiving no premedication (n = 15), a placebo tablet (n = 15), diazepam 5 mg p.o. (n = 15), or atropine 0.01 mg/kg i.m. (n = 15), in connection with spinal analgesia for elective caesarean section. In the patients receiving no premedication, the subjective estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep was negatively associated with concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in CSF, and with plasma adrenaline. The anxiolytic effect of diazepam was reflected as significantly lower plasma levels of another metabolite of NA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). Placebo and diazepam, and to a lesser extent atropine, confounded the statistical relationships between the clinical and biochemical responses found in the patients with no premedication. On the whole, the biochemical monoamine measurements were of little use in determining the clinical effects of different kinds of premedicants.", 
    "70": "Apomorphine (APO) has been shown to elevate tryptophan, serotonin (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in the dorsal raphe (DR) and its corresponding projection site, the striatum, but not in the median raphe (MR) and its terminal area, the hippocampus. We have previously demonstrated that these effects are indirectly mediated through dopamine (DA) autoreceptors in the substantia nigra and possibly gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in or near the DR. In the present study, we have further found that the effects of APO on 5-HT neurons are also mediated through both nicotinic and M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors as well as GABAA receptors in the DR. This suggestion is based on the findings that both atropine and mecamylamine antagonized the effects of APO, while carbachol at a high dose exerted an effect opposite to that of APO. Besides, pirenzepine and bicuculline at low doses also antagonized, whereas saclofen did not alter the influence of APO on 5-HT in the striatum. Bicuculline at a higher dose enhanced tryptophan and 5-HT measures by itself. None of the drugs studied had a significant effect on tryptophan, 5-HT, or 5-HIAA in the hippocampus. These results together suggest that DA, ACh, and GABA neurons are all involved in the actions of APO on 5-HT, while the direct synaptic relationships among these neurotransmitters and the precise anatomical locus for these interactions to occur are still unknown. It is possible that APO, by inhibiting DA neuron firing in the substantia nigra and through the GABA disinhibition mechanism, therefore indirectly activates 5-HT neurons in the DR and the striatum. While the above neuronal firing model well explains the elevation of 5-HIAA, the simultaneous increases of tryptophan and 5-HT, especially tryptophan, may be more readily explained by a mechanism of tryptophan uptake upon APO administration. Further anatomical, biochemical, and electrophysiological studies are ongoing to test this hypothesis and to clarify the circuit and the anatomical locus (loci) for these interactions to occur.", 
    "71": "Aphasia due to simple partial status epilepticus is rare, particularly in the absence of a seizure history. No previous report describes acute aphasia as the sole clinical manifestation of EEG-monitored status epilepticus, with prompt resolution with treatment. We report a 45-year-old man with a left temporal glioblastoma who acutely developed a global aphasia, during which an EEG revealed continual repetitive sharp waves emanating from the left hemisphere. After injection of i.v. diazepam, the EEG seizure activity ceased, and the patient's language output returned to preseizure levels.", 
    "72": "The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is present in virions and infected cells as an heterodimer (p66/p51). A new class of potent and selective HIV-1 inhibitors, the tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives, were found to exert their antiviral activity by interacting with monomeric HIV-1 RT (p66) in a way different from that of previously studied RT inhibitors such as azidothymidine 5'-triphosphate. Upon examination of the kinetic properties of the heterodimeric HIV-1 RT and its inhibition by TIBO compounds, a positive cooperativity between the subunits of the enzyme with regard to the 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates and the template/primer was observed. The cooperativity with respect to the template/primer may result from a progressive dimerization in the presence of increasing concentrations of the template/primer, a process referred to as polysteric linkage. Because the cooperativity of p66/p51 was abolished in the presence of TIBO, these compounds behave as allosteric inhibitors.", 
    "73": "This study was designed to assess whether rats made tolerant to the suppressant action on Fixed Ratio operant responding of the benzodiazepine (BZ) chlordiazepoxide (CDP) would show behavioural disruption on drug withdrawal--so-called operant behavioural dependence. In addition, the study examined the effects of the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron on such operant behavioural dependence. During 42 consecutive days of CDP treatment, at doses escalated from 10 to 30 mg/kg/day, marked tolerance developed to the rate-suppressant action of CDP. On subsequent days, during spontaneous withdrawal, response rates declined significantly by around 30% in animals treated with saline, although some recovery of responding was seen over successive days of withdrawal. Similar reductions in responding followed by recovery were seen in rats treated with the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, b.i.d.). These findings demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to use operant procedures to detect spontaneous BZ withdrawal. They also suggest, in agreement with recent studies from this laboratory (Leathley and Goudie 1992), that 5-HT3 antagonists may have relatively limited utility in treating some signs of BZ dependence.", 
    "74": "Chronic exposure to mild unpredictable stress has previously been found to depress the consumption of palatable sweet solutions. In the present study this effect was reversed by chronic (9 weeks) treatment with the atypical antidepressants, fluoxetine and maprotiline (5 mg/kg/day); the non-antidepressant chlordiazepoxide was ineffective. Stressed animals were also subsensitive to food reward in the place conditioning procedure; however, fluoxetine and maprotiline treated animals showed normal place preference conditioning. Acute pretreatment with raclopride (100 micrograms/kg) selectively reversed the recovery of sucrose drinking in antidepressant-treated stressed animals. These results extend previous reports of the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants in this paradigm, and support the hypothesis of a dopaminergic mechanism of antidepressant action.", 
    "75": "Exposure of male Wistar rats to one single session of ten inescapable footshocks induces changes in the behavioural responses to environmental stimuli as measured in the \"noise test\" 14 days later. Shocked (S) rats showed decreased locomotion and rearing during the first 3 min of exposure to a novel environment compared to control (C) rats. When the 85 dB background noise was switched off a marked immobility response emerged in S rats, concomitant with a further decrease in locomotion and rearing. In response to noise off, C rats showed hardly any immobility and a much smaller reduction in locomotion and rearing compared to S rats. These long-lasting changes in behaviour were not reversed by acute treatment with the antidepressants fluvoxamine (3.0-30.0 mg/kg) and desmethylimipramine (DMI, 2.5-10.0 mg/kg) injected IP 30 min before the noise test on day 14 following the shock session. Chronic treatment (day 1 to day 14) with fluvoxamine or DMI did not reverse the behavioural deficits induced by shock exposure. Diazepam (0.6-5.0 mg/kg) administered acutely only reversed the effects of shock on locomotion during the first 3 min of the noise test. Chronic treatment with diazepam normalized the shock-induced decrease in locomotion and attenuated the rearing decrease during the first 3 min of the test, and partially restored shock-induced changes in behavioural response to switching off the noise. The most potent drug in this study was the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan (0.3-3.0 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Psychophysical experiments in humans have revealed similar characteristics of visual receptive fields as were found in cats and monkeys from retinal ganglion cell recordings. In addition, in some retinal ganglion cells of cats the GABA antagonist bicuculline decreases the activity of the inhibitory surround. These findings led to two predicitions: 1) benzodiazepines will selectively increase the inhibitory surround of human visual receptive fields, 2) after dark adaptation, no free GABA will be available in the synapses and benzodiazepines will have no effect on the visual system. Characteristics of human receptive fields were determined by subthreshold summation: the contrast threshold of a vertical line was measured dependent on the distance of two parallel flanking lines whose contrast was below threshold. Both hypotheses were confirmed: the threshold in the inhibitory region of receptive fields was specifically increased in a dose-dependent manner by midazolam PO (7.5 mg: P < 0.05; 15 mg: P < 0.01). In dark-adapted subjects no effect of midazolam was found. Control experiments with atropine (1 mg IV), sulpiride (100 mg IM), and levodopa (100 mg PO) showed no specific effect. The visual system may be a model to bridge the gap between animal and human psychopharmacology.", 
    "77": "The effects of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) full agonists chlordiazepoxide and midazolam, and the partial agonist beta-carboline ZK 91,296 on the rat's performance in a simple reaction time paradigm were examined. This task required the animals to respond to a rarely and unpredictably occurring brief (50 ms) visual stimulus. Non-parametric measures of signal sensitivity and response bias derived from signal-detection theory were used as a basis for the dissociation between the effects of these drugs on attentional abilities and general responsivity. The dose-dependent effects of midazolam (0.1-3.13 mg/kg) on signal sensitivity and general responsivity occurred in parallel. In contrast, the effects of chlordiazepoxide (1.56-12.5 mg/kg) on signal sensitivity were largely independent from effects on response bias. The partial agonist ZK 91,296 (0.39-25 mg/kg) in general had little effect on performance. The effects of the highest doses of chlordiazepoxide and midazolam were reversed by the co-administration of the BZR antagonist Ro15-1788 (15 mg/kg). Additionally, extension of the stimulus presentation time to 500 ms decreased the magnitude of the effect of chlordiazepoxide on signal sensitivity. These results support the hypothesis that BZR agonist-induced disruption of attentional abilities is not necessarily confounded by effects on general responsivity or sedation, and thus may represent a discrete pharmacological property of BZR-agonists.", 
    "78": "Long-term effects of chronic treatment with a GABA-T (GABA-transaminase) inhibitor, ethanolamine O-sulphate (EOS) (200 mg/kg/day for the postnatal days 3-21) on the binding parameters of GABAA receptors, hypothalamic monoamines and subsequent behavior were studied in Wistar rats. At the age of 1 month, EOS-treated rats showed reduced activity in the open-field and, at the age of 4 months, their voluntary alcohol consumption was increased. No changes were seen in Porsolt's swim test or in the plus-maze test. Weight gain was significantly retarded in EOS-treated rats. Maximal stimulation of [3H] flunitrazepam binding by GABA was decreased in the cerebral cortex and the EC50-value for the GABA stimulation increased in the hippocampus in the EOS rats at the age of 4 months. EOS treatment did not alter the cerebellar diazepam sensitive and insensitive binding components of the imidazobenzodiazepine [3H]Ro 15-4513. No changes were observed in the hypothalamic monoamine concentrations. The results are in agreement with the idea that GABA-T inhibitor treatment permanently alters GABAA mechanisms. Moreover, altering the CNS GABA level during development increases adult alcohol intake in rat.", 
    "79": "In order to evaluate the action of central nervous system Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) in the control of feeding behavior the present studies employed a dietary self-selection task sensitive both to overall appetite as well as preferential intake of familiar versus unfamiliar foods. Prior to the diet selection test, one group of nutritionally stressed animals was fed a protein deficient diet in order to increase the preference for unfamiliar foods relative to nutritionally replete subjects. Both CRF (0.05 and 0.5 micrograms ICV) and physical restraint (30 min) attenuated selectively the consumption of a novel food choice by deficient animals without affecting concurrent intake of familiar food. Further, CRF administration did not alter water intake or consumption of either diet by the replete control group suggesting that the peptide produced a stress dependent, enhanced response to novelty without a general effect on appetite. The CRF antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (1, 5 and 25 micrograms ICV), increased familiar diet consumption in nutritionally deficient subjects without affecting the self-selection pattern or replete controls. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) also increased selectively the intake of familiar food suggesting that this action is the anxiolytic complement of the effect of stress in this paradigm. The CRF antagonist (5 and 25 micrograms) reversed the anorexia produced by CRF (0.5 micrograms) as well as that induced by restraint stress. These results favor a direct role for endogenous CRF systems in coordinating the behavioral responses to dietary stress.", 
    "80": "The neurophysiological interactions between the high pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) and a new beta carboline, abecarnil, were studied in the non-human primate Papio anubis. Abecarnil is a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor. Six animals were exposed on two occasions to pressures of 91 ATA in an environment of helium and oxygen. One exposure was pretreated with a total dose of abecarnil 1.0 mg/kg, the other with an equivalent volume of vehicle. Treatment with abecarnil prevented the severe signs of HPNS occurring between 51 and 91 ATA. Onset pressures of the various signs were unaffected. Some signs, e.g. myoclonus, became more frequent when abecarnil was used. A residual protective effect of abecarnil was present 4 weeks after the dose was given, active at pressures less than 71 ATA. Changes with pressure in the EEG were recorded primarily from the frontal cortex, but were also present in the parietal and occipital areas of the left cortex. Amplitude and frequency spectra were calculated and changes with pressure in the four conventional wavebands, plus two others, analysed. The most striking change was the prevention by abecarnil of the pressure-induced 100% increase in alpha wave amplitude in the frontal region. It is concluded that modulation of GABA transmission is important in controlling the expression of HPNS.", 
    "81": "The acute effects of diazepam on plasma GABA were determined in 18 patients with panic disorder, 13 patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 20 healthy controls. All subjects were benzodiazepine-naive. Four logarithmically increasing doses of diazepam/placebo were administered intravenously at 15-min intervals on 2 separate days. Plasma GABA was measured at baseline and 3 min after the highest dose of diazepam/placebo. There was an overall decrease in plasma GABA that was significantly greater following diazepam compared with placebo, but no group differences in response. In a separate group of 18 panic disorder patients receiving chronic benzodiazepine treatment with alprazolam, the same diazepam infusion procedure (no placebo day) produced decreases in plasma GABA similar to those seen in the untreated panic disorder patients. The clinical and physiologic implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "82": "The hypothermic effects of intraperitoneal (IP) administration of the full benzodiazepine agonist loprazolam (1, 10 mg/kg); the partial agonist Ro 17-1812 (1, 10 mg/kg); the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10, 20 mg/kg); the benzodiazepine inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg) and Ro 19-4603 (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg) and the beta-carboline inverse agonists FG 7142 (10, 30 mg/kg) and DMCM (1, 3, 10 mg/kg) were investigated in three strains of mice. TO mice were less sensitive than CBA/cA and DBA/2 mice, since only loprazolam and the partial and full beta-carboline inverse agonists FG 7142 and DMCM lowered body temperature in these animals. CBA/cA mice were particularly sensitive to the hypothermic effects of loprazolam and Ro 17-1812, and also responded to the beta-carboline but not the benzo diazepine inverse agonists. In contrast, DBA/2 mice responded with moderate hypothermia to loprazolam, Ro 17-1812, and to the partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513, and exhibited marked hypothermia in response to the more efficacious benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 19-4603 and to FG 7142 and DMCM. Flumazenil did not alter body temperature. DBA/2 mice were also more sensitive to the convulsant activity of inverse agonists than TO mice. CBA/cA mice exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the convulsant, but not the hypothermic, effects of Ro 19-4603, showing dissociation of these responses. The mechanisms underlying the genetic differences in sensitivity of mice to the hypothermic and convulsant action of the different ligands are unknown and warrant further investigation.", 
    "83": "To investigate anxiolytic effects of nitrous oxide (N2O), male mice were tested in two exploratory models--a two-chambered light-dark (L-D) unit and a holeboard. Tests were conducted inside a glovebag through which one of three mixtures of N2O and oxygen (25, 50 and 75% N2O) or room air (RA) was circulated at a flow rate of 10 l/min. The principal findings in the L-D unit were a concentration-related increase in number of interdepartmental transitions and a generalized increase in time spent on the light side. Nitrous oxide effectively elevated transitions in the L-D unit at a lower concentration (25% N2O) than was required to increase locomotor activity in an open field (50% N2O), suggesting that these two measures are at least partially independent; transitions might reflect a specific exploratory component of locomotor behavior. In the holeboard test, a concentration-related increase in number of head dips was observed. Pretreatment with naltrexone-HCl or saline vehicle revealed a contribution by an endogenous opioid-linked locomotor stimulant effect in some measures. A dose-related reversal by flumazenil of 50% N2O-induced shifts in number of head dips and time spent head-dipping implicates a benzodiazepine receptor. Both paradigms, in particular the holeboard, should prove useful in future N2O research.", 
    "84": "The effect of midazolam and vecuronium on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and mean cerebral blood flow velocity (MCBFV) was evaluated in premature infants (birthweight 550-2,560 g; gestational age 26-36 weeks) randomised to receive either 0.1 mg/kg midazolam (n = 7) or 0.05 mg/kg vecuronium (n = 8) intravenously. MAP, by means of an indwelling arterial catheter, and MCBFV, by means of non-invasive pulsed-Doppler of the middle cerebral artery, were measured every 5 min, starting at 10 min prior to until 1 h after drug administration. A transient 25-43% decrease in MCBFV (mean 0.06 m/s) dependent on a 8-23% decrease in blood pressure (mean 9 mm Hg) was noted in all patients within 15 min following administration of midazolam, which returned to baseline values within 1 h. In 2 out of 7 infants, a plasma expander was required. In contrast, vecuronium only decreased the MCBFV in 3 of 8 infants. Thus, a bolus of midazolam transiently decreased blood pressure and MCBFV, and should be used cautiously in sick preterm infants.", 
    "85": "Modulation of memory trace retrieval in emotiogenic brain structures, cortex and brainstem reticular formation by postsynaptic noradrenergic and dopaminergic drugs was found. At the initial stage of latent inhibition-a most significant mechanism of information selection-memory trace retrieval is retarded in all structures and in the cortex and the zona incerta later on. A haloperidol model of latent inhibition was obtained. Most important role of dopaminergic system in latent inhibition was shown. Inhibition of the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex by the blockade of GABA-receptors induced by bicuculline, the chloride channels by picrotoxin, the benzodiazepine receptors by flumazenil (R015-1788) and R015-3505 facilitates the memory trace retrieval damaged by amnesic agent. The dopaminergic activation enhances the dominant state and developes conditions for switching on the interferential GABA-ergic inhibition.", 
    "86": "Experiments on 1,200 male mice (150 groups) of three strains (SHR bred from Swiss, C57BL/6 and CC57BR) were made during 4 years (1986-1989) to test five anxiolytics (diazepam, phenazepam, chlordiazepoxide, phenibut, buspiron) and ethanol, three anxiogens (pentylenetetrazol, caffeine, yohimbine) and three putative endogenous anxiogens (beta-phenylethylamine, kynurenine and quinolinic acid) using a dark-light chamber. None of the drugs administered within a wide dose range produced any stable reproducible effect on the number of transitions between two compartments or on the dark preference. Thus, the reported data on an increase in the number of transitions induced by benzodiazepine anxiolytics were not confirmed. The data obtained demonstrate that the dark-light chamber is not a reliable system for simulating anxiety in mice."
