    "0": "Pentylenetetrazol is anxiogenic in humans and produces an interoceptive discriminative stimulus in rats which is mimicked by anxiogenic drugs and other treatments and antagonized by anxiolytic drugs. It was proposed that the discriminative stimulus of pentylenetetrazol originates centrally. This hypothesis was tested by injecting small amounts of anxiogenic or anxiolytic drugs into the brain and comparing their ability to mimic or block, respectively, the response to pentylenetetrazol, observed after systemic injection. Food-restricted rats were trained in a two-lever operant task to discriminate the interoceptive discriminative stimulus produced by pentylenetetrazol. Intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of Ro 5-3663 was substituted in a dose-dependent manner for the stimulus produced by systemically administered pentylenetetrazol. Diazepam injected systemically, blocked the pentylenetetrazol-like stimulus associated with Ro 5-3663 administered systemically or centrally. Midazolam injected intracerebroventricularly and in a dose-dependent manner, antagonized the discriminative stimulus produced by systemic injection of pentylenetetrazol. When injected into the amygdala, midazolam also antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the pentylenetetrazol-induced stimulus. Thus, these data suggest that there are sites in the CNS for both the initiation of a pentylenetetrazol-like stimulus by Ro 5-3663 and the antagonism of the stimulus produced by pentylenetetrazol by midazolam.", 
    "1": "Intravenous self-administration of the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam was assessed in rats under conditions of unlimited access to the drug (24 hr/day). Evaluation of the temporal pattern of responding within a session revealed that maximal responding occurred during the dark phase of the 12 hr light/dark cycle. Upon attaining stable rates of responding for midazolam, the rats were tested under extinction conditions (saline). Responding progressively decreased with repeated extinction sessions. Over the course of subsequent reacquisition sessions responding increased, such that asymptotic levels of responding were similar to, or greater than, the rates obtained during the initial acquisition phase. In addition, the total number of sessions required to approach asymptote were fewer than during the initial acquisition phase. Thus, rats given continuous access to midazolam exhibited reliable and stable rates of intravenous self-administration of this short-acting benzodiazepine.", 
    "2": "Many commonly used anesthetics cause hypothermia by inhibiting central and peripheral thermoregulatory mechanisms. Although it is probable that a loss of thermal homeostasis contributes directly to the high mortality frequently reported following anesthesia of laboratory rodents, this adverse effect has been investigated rarely in the past. This study compared the effects of three parenteral anesthetics (pentobarbital, ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam) and a neuroleptanalgesic (fentanyl-droperidol) on core and surface body temperature regulation in rats. Results showed a profound hypothermia with all dosages of pentobarbital, while ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam caused a dose-dependent depression in core and surface body temperature. All dosages of fentanyl-droperidol (Innovar-Vet) caused minimal depression in thermoregulation, suggesting that it is the drug which requires the least external thermal support. Results of this study also suggested that inability to compensate for heat loss, particularly from the body core, may profoundly influence anesthetic toxicity and the safety of anesthetic procedures.", 
    "3": "The increased use of rats for laboratory studies has increased the urgency for a better understanding of their perception of painful or noxious stimuli and the means of obtunding such stimuli. Four different injectable drugs, pentobarbital, fentanyl-droperidol (Innovar-Vet), ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam, were evaluated in this study. Unlike previous studies in rodents, this study has quantitated noxious stimulus perception following a temporal sequence of observations. Results showed the greatest inhibition of noxious stimulus perception with Innovar-Vet, lesser inhibition with ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam, and the least obtunding of nociception with pentobarbital. Results of this study also suggested that a spatial orientation, similar to that present in man, exists within the CNS of rats for receipt of noxious stimulation.", 
    "4": "Proper use of anesthetics is of paramount importance for humane animal care. Current research trends show a greater reliance on rats for laboratory investigations. This study compared several dosages for four different drugs, (pentobarbital, fentanyl-droperidol, ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam) for use in the laboratory rat. Each drug was evaluated in respect to its onset, duration of effect, recovery, adverse effects and mortality. A quantitative assessment of the depth of anesthesia also was obtained for all dosages of each drug. Results showed that all tested dosages of pentobarbital, ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam were suitable anesthetics for use in the laboratory rat. Low dosages of fentanyl-droperidol (Innovar-Vet), however, appeared to produce a state known as neuroleptanalgesia as opposed to anesthesia seen with the other agents.", 
    "5": "Treatment with clonazepam was studied in a group of 20 patients suffering from periodic movements in sleep, in a double-blind parallel group design. Eleven complained of excessive daytime sleepiness, and nine complained of insomnia. Ten patients received clonazepam, and 10 received placebo, over a period of 1 month. Clonazepam (0.5-2 mg per night) proved to be an effective treatment of periodic movements in sleep. Polysomnographic recordings demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of leg movements and a significant improvement in sleep parameters in the clonazepam group as compared with placebo. Subjective responses to treatment corroborated the sleep laboratory findings.", 
    "6": "Triazolam pharmacokinetics and effects on sedation, short-term amnesia, and psychomotor performance were evaluated in 25 normal volunteers as part of a safety and tolerance study of intravenous dosing of triazolam. Triazolam kinetics were linear after intravenous administration of doses up to 1.0 mg with no differences among doses in elimination half-life, volume of distribution, or clearance. The hepatic extraction ratio ranged from 0.14 to 0.37, suggesting that triazolam should undergo moderate first-pass metabolism after oral administration. The duration and extent of sedation, decrement in psychomotor performance test scores, and amnesia were dose related, but all subjects returned to baseline alertness and function within eight hours of dosing. The time-course of effects on memory and psychomotor performance were related to triazolam plasma concentration profile using an Emax model for effect and a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The probability of a subject being asleep was related to triazolam plasma concentrations using logistic regression. These models indicate that intravenous doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg triazolam would be effective for use preoperatively for short surgical procedures.", 
    "7": "We use BERA to determine the hearing threshold of children. This examination is most of the time performed on outpatients and often combined with a minor surgery. That's the reason why a sedation has to fulfill following conditions: 1. a quick, non-traumatic induction of anaesthesia--normally--without premedication; 2. an anesthesia deep enough to enable us to carry out a minor surgery as well as to get the best reliable BERA results; 3. a short period of wake-up as the patient should leave the hospital as soon as possible. In short, we got the best results first using Halothane as inhalant for the minor surgery and continuing with Midazolam as i.v. sedative for BERA examination.", 
    "8": "Various reactions to benzodiazepine withdrawal have been widely described. Among these, seizures have occasionally occurred on abrupt withdrawal. Our own experience of 48 cases of seizures suspected to have been caused by benzodiazepine withdrawal and reported to the Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Monitoring Center (1979-1985) showed that a great variety of benzodiazepines with different half-lives were involved, those most frequently implicated being the most widely prescribed. The occurrence of seizures was not always related to the interruption of long-term treatment (from a few days to greater than 7 years) nor to high-dose treatment, the range of dosages being usually close to that recommended. However, in some cases, several benzodiazepines had been taken simultaneously. The time between the last intake of the drug(s) and the occurrence of the seizures was shorter when a short-life benzodiazepine had been used. Additional factors were frequently involved; these factors were present in 29 cases and were multiple in nine of them. The incidence of withdrawal seizures was related more to the presence of these additional factors than to either the pharmacokinetics of the drugs or the pattern of treatment.", 
    "9": "Male mice of the BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6 strains were implanted with electrodes in the CA1 area of the hippocampus to record rhythmic slow-wave activity (RSA) or 'theta' EEG activity. The EEG spectral characteristics and the animal's motor behavior were studied while the animals walked on a moving belt (2.2 cm/s) both before and after i.p. injections of diazepam (Valium, 2 mg/kg) or vehicle. EEG spectral analyses were carried out on-line by computer. Diazepam produced a dissociation of locomotion and RSA. (1) Uninjected and vehicle-injected mice showed typical RSA (7-8 Hz) while walking. (2) Under diazepam, 7-8 Hz RSA virtually disappeared and was replaced in the temporally averaged records by RSA with a sharp, narrow-band peak at 4-5 Hz. (3) This lower-frequency RSA was associated with immobility if, and only if, the immobility immediately followed walking. This was true whether the animal itself stopped walking or the experimenter stopped the moving belt. This theta activity predominated for about 30 s and had disappeared after 2 min. Locomotion, on the other hand, was accompanied by irregular EEG activity. (4) Scopolamine (i.p. 1 mg/kg), a cholinergic blocker, greatly reduced the diazepam-induced 4-5 Hz RSA, but also partially restored 7-8 Hz RSA. The possibility that the effects of diazepam on hippocampal EEG involve changes in septohippocampal cholinergic activity is discussed.", 
    "10": "1 Pharmacological differences have been observed between the muscarinic agonist-induced depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses of the rat isolated superior cervical ganglion. 2 Pirenzepine (0.3 microM) selectively reduced the depolarizing response and unmasked the hyperpolarizing response. No such selectivity was observed with a concentration of N-methylatropine which was equipotent with pirenzepine in antagonizing the depolarizing response. 3 The neuromuscular blocking agents gallamine (10 microM) and pancuronium (3 microM) exhibited the oppositive selectivity to pirenzepine, both dramatically reduced the hyperpolarization but only slightly antagonized the depolarization. 4 The potencies of a range of agonists in evoking the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses, the latter in the presence of 0.3 microM pirenzepine, have been determined. Methylfurmethide failed to hyperpolarize the ganglion at concentrations which evoked maximal depolarizations. 5 The muscarinic hyperpolarization did not appear to be mediated by the secondary release of catecholamines. 6 It was concluded that the two muscarinic responses on the rat superior cervical ganglion, the slow depolarization and faster hyperpolarization, are mediated by different muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "11": "1 Functional studies have indicated that muscarinic receptors in cardiac tissue differ from those in the ileum. In the present study ileal and cardiac muscarinic receptors identified by [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) were characterized and the selectivity of currently available ileal and atrial selective antagonists determined. 2 In terms of the current functional classification of muscarinic receptors both ileal and cardiac muscarinic receptors were of the M2 subtype based upon their low affinity for pirenzepine. 3 Cyclohexylphenyl(2-piperidinoethyl)silanol (CPPS), a highly ileal selective antagonist in functional studies, was unable to distinguish between ileal and atrial muscarinic receptors identified in binding studies. Furthermore, although AF-DX 116 and dicyclomine were able to differentiate atrial and ileal muscarinic receptors, neither compound was more than 2 fold selective. These data indicate that it is not possible to subclassify ileal and atrial muscarinic receptors using direct ligand binding studies with these antagonists. 4 In circular ileal smooth muscle, apparent heterogeneity of the M2 muscarinic receptor population was observed. Thus AF-DX 116 identified two populations of sites with affinities differing by 30 fold. These two populations of M2 muscarinic receptors may represent the typical M2 muscarinic receptors identified in cardiac tissue and the more recently discovered 'gland type' M2 muscarinic receptors. 5 The circular ileal smooth muscle tissue homogenate was able to decrease dramatically the apparent affinity of adiphenine. This activity, which appeared to result from a phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (PMSF) sensitive protease effect, should be considered when conducting studies using this tissue preparation and compounds of similar structure to adiphenine.", 
    "12": "When rats (500 g, male) are exercised on a treadmill, pretreatment with the carbamate physostigmine reduces endurance capacity (run time, RT) and increases the rate of rise of core temperature (heating rate, HR). Because physostigmine is a potential nerve agent pretreatment drug, our objective was to determine whether pharmacological intervention could reverse these decrements in performance and thermoregulation. The following drugs were administered separately via tail vein: vehicle-control (C), atropine (200 micrograms.kg-1, A), diazepam (500 micrograms.kg-1, D), and physostigmine (200 micrograms.kg-1, PH). After drug administration, rats were run (11 m.min-1, 6 degrees elevation, Ta = 26 degrees C) to exhaustion. PH administration resulted in reduced RT (41 min PH vs. 53 min C, p less than 0.05) with greater HR (0.090 degrees C.min-1 PH vs. 0.057 degrees C.min-1 C, p less than 0.01) than control rats. However, when A and D were also given to PH treated rats, the RT and HR were restored to control levels. Further, A and D without PH improved RT and HR (82 min, 0.047 degrees C.min-1) over control levels. Serial administration of an anticholinergic, an anticonvulsant, and an anticholinesterase resulted in no significant change in performance from control levels.", 
    "13": "The plasma protein binding of clonazepam was investigated in healthy volunteers, cirrhotic patients, chronic uremic patients maintained on hemodialysis, and patients with reduced renal function. Each group consisted of six subjects. The unbound fraction of clonazepam (mean +/- SEM) was 13.9 +/- 0.2% in volunteers. 17.1 +/- 1.0% in cirrhotic patients, 1.56 +/- 0.5% before and 12.2 +/- 0.4% after hemodialysis in chronic uremic patients, and 16.0 +/- 0.7% in patients with poor renal function. The figure for the healthy subjects was significantly different from that of cirrhotic patients only. Binding of clonazepam to albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was also studied. Clonazepam bound preferentially to albumin.", 
    "14": "In order to explore the possible sites at which benzodiazepines alter sleep, we have performed sleep studies following administration of 0.5 microgram of triazolam into the dorsal raphe nucleus of rats. Triazolam significantly increased sleep latency and decreased non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with an effect greatest in the first 2 hours after injection. Total REM sleep time was not significantly affected, although there was a modest trend toward reduction in the first 2 hours. In contrast to the decreased sleep resulting from injection into the dorsal raphe nucleus, triazolam did not significantly alter sleep in animals in whom it was injected into surrounding areas. Similarly, the low dose employed in this study did not significantly affect sleep when injected into the lateral ventricle. These data are reminiscent of studies showing transient decreases in sleep following lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus.", 
    "15": "Sleep disturbance is often the result of specific pathophysiologies of sleep or of psychiatric illness. When this is the case, specific treatment of these conditions is indicated. When such disorders are not found, hypnotics often play a useful role, particularly as adjunctive treatment while the patient receives behaviorally-oriented therapy. Considerations in choosing a hypnotic should include issues of residual daytime effects, special problems of the elderly, interaction with alcohol, dependence, and effects on respiration.", 
    "16": "The value of intravenous aminophylline in accelerating recovery from premedication with diazepam was assessed against placebo in a randomized, double-blind trial. One hundred ten patients undergoing routine diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy received diazepam intravenously in a dosage sufficient to achieve adequate sedation. On completion of the endoscopy, patients received either aminophylline (1.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Recovery from sedation was assessed on clinical grounds by a nurse, objectively using a serial reaction time test, and by the patient on a visual analogue scale. The number of patients judged to be fully alert at 30 and 60 min after the procedure was significantly greater in the aminophylline group than in the placebo group. Compared with values obtained before sedation, the placebo group had significantly prolonged reaction times 30 min after completion of the endoscopy, whereas patients who received aminophylline did not. However, according to their self-assessments, patients in both groups felt more uncoordinated following sedation. Aminophylline appears to hasten recovery from sedation with diazepam, and its use may permit earlier mobilization of patients after endoscopy.", 
    "17": "Clonazepam (CLN), a benzodiazepine originally used as an anti-epileptic, was tested in schizophrenia in a double blind comparison in combination with haloperidol (HL). Twenty-four schizophrenic inpatients, diagnosed according to DSM III were treated with HL and CLN (Group 1) or HL and placebo (Group 2) for 4 weeks. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Extrapyramidal Side Effect Scale (EPSE) were used for assessing psychopathological features and extrapyramidal side-effects before treatment and then weekly. No differences in specific schizophrenic symptoms were detected between the two groups, but in Group 1 an early significant BPRS amelioration was noticed compared to Group 2. Moreover, the excitement item improved significantly in Group 1 only, from the second week. Less severe EPSE scores were observed in Group 1 in comparison to Group 2. In conclusion the combination of CLN and HL seems to be preferred to HL alone in cases of psychotic excitement and in order to reduce the severity of extrapyramidal side-effects.", 
    "18": "Sulfated CCK-8 but not non-sulfated CCK-8 induced a dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin levels in fed mice. In fasted mice, however, the CCK peptides caused a non-significant to minimal elevation of plasma insulin. Refeeding fasted mice for 1 h prior to CCK-8-S administration was sufficient to cause a significant elevation of plasma insulin levels. The peripheral CCK antagonist, L-364,718, prevented the CCK-8-S-induced elevation of plasma insulin observed in fed mice. In conclusion, CCK produces a nutrition-dependent increase in plasma insulin levels in vivo via an action upon peripheral CCK receptors.", 
    "19": "The clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment of panic and phobic disorders are reviewed. Evidence from genetic, epidemiological, biological, and pharmacological studies suggests that phobic and panic disorders differ from other psychiatric illnesses. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, causing excessive release of norepinephrine from the locus ceruleus, is implicated in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Overstimulation of the locus ceruleus by yohimbine, sodium lactate, and carbon dioxide can cause feelings of panic and anxiety in both patients with panic disorder and control subjects. Currently, excessive activity of the locus ceruleus is the only comprehensive neuroanatomic and physiological hypothesis for the etiology of panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressant agents (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), anxiolytic agents, and adrenergic agents all have been used to treat phobic and panic disorders. TCAs and the benzodiazepines, particularly alprazolam, are the drugs most commonly chosen for therapy. If these agents are ineffective, an MAOI or combination therapy can be tried. MAOIs are second-line agents for many patients because of toxicity and dietary limitations. Whether they are more effective than other agents requires further study. Panic and phobic disorders and depression have in common many properties of a dysregulated system; an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of panic and phobic disorders should lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies.", 
    "20": "A 12-month, multicenter, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the new nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic buspirone. The study population consisted of 700 patients with DSM-III generalized anxiety disorder who ranged in age from 16 to 84 years. Ninety-two percent had symptoms of anxiety that had persisted for 3 months or longer. According to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the Physician Global Opinion of Improvement, and the Patient Opinion of Improvement, the use of buspirone resulted in a significant reduction in anxiety. The degree of this improvement correlated with the duration of drug use. After the third month of therapy, there was an extremely low incidence of patient discontinuation due to side effects or insufficient improvement. Adverse effects were typical of those observed in other double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that compared buspirone with benzodiazepines. Overall, buspirone was well tolerated for maintenance therapy.", 
    "21": "Combinations of metoclopramide and dexamethasone given intravenously control vomiting caused by high doses of cisplatin. Lorazepam and diphenhydramine are useful adjuncts to antiemetics. In a double-blind trial, 120 patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (120 mg/m2) for the first time were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (1.5 mg/m2) or diphenhydramine (50 mg) intravenously, 45 minutes prior to cisplatin. In addition, all patients received intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg) 40 minutes prior to chemotherapy along with metoclopramide (3 mg/kg) 30 minutes before and 90 minutes after cisplatin. Patients were directly observed in the hospital after cisplatin administration and completed a subjective assessment questionnaire. Overall, 60% of patients experienced no vomiting, and 83% had two or fewer emetic episodes during the study. There were no significant differences in objective antiemetic control between the two regimens. Only 3% of patients receiving lorazepam experienced treatment-related restlessness as opposed to 19% given diphenhydramine (P = 0.007). Less recall of chemotherapy administration (P less than 0.001), more sedation (P = 0.003), and transient enuresis while sedated (P = 0.0002) were characteristic of patients receiving lorazepam. Patient-generated ratings revealed less anxiety (P = 0.0001) for those individuals given the lorazepam-containing combination. Both regimens were well accepted, with 89% of patients receiving the lorazepam combination and 83% of those given the diphenhydramine regimen wishing to receive the same drugs in the future. Some degree of delayed vomiting occurred in 85% of patients during the 4-day period following this study. During the time that patients are at the greatest risk for emesis, the 24 hours immediately following cisplatin, three drug antiemetic combinations of either lorazepam or diphenhydramine with metoclopramide plus dexamethasone stopped cisplatin-induced emesis for the majority of patients and lessen other treatment-related side effects. Less restlessness and anxiety were observed among individuals receiving the lorazepam-containing combination.", 
    "22": "This report describes observations of the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diazepam (7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one ; 5 mg/kg) during the concomitant administration of diazepam and imipramine hydrochloride (5-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine monohydrochloride; 20 and 50 mg/kg) to rats. We measured plasma, brain, and liver concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites in rats by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concomitant use of imipramine hydrochloride increased diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations, but decreased temazepam and oxazepam concentrations in rat plasma. Diazepam plasma protein binding was unaltered. The liver concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites showed similar changes in their plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of imipramine hydrochloride increased the concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites in the brain. We also studied the effect of benzodiazepines on convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole (6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-tetrazolo[1,5-a] azepine; 135 mg/kg) in rats. The concomitant use of imipramine hydrochloride led to an increased antipentylenetetrazole effect of diazepam. This result is in accordance with the findings on brain concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites.", 
    "23": "The role of the GABA system in producing a pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive discriminative stimulus during withdrawal from diazepam was investigated in rats by determining the sensitivity of this system to GABAergic drugs before and after chronic treatment with diazepam. Food-restricted rats were trained to obtain a reward of food by responding on one lever following an injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 20 mg/kg) and the other lever following an injection of saline (1 ml/kg). After rats had acquired this discrimination, the effectiveness of Ro 15-1788, bicuculline and yohimbine to substitute for pentylenetetrazol was determined. Prior to chronic treatment with diazepam, rats selected the appropriate lever for saline after Ro 15-1788 and the appropriate lever for pentylenetetrazol after bicuculline (0.04-2.5 mg/kg) or yohimbine (0.16-5.0 mg/kg). Although the selection of the appropriate lever for pentylenetetrazol was dose-dependent, full substitution for pentylenetetrazol was not obtained with either drug as larger doses of bicuculline produced convulsions while the rats began to select the appropriate lever for saline after larger doses of yohimbine (bell-shaped curve). Diazepam blocked the pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive discriminative stimulus for bicuculline. The rats were then injected with diazepam (80 mg/kg/8 hr) for 24 days. Upon termination of the administration of diazepam, the animals were tested for lever-selection following the administration of saline, Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg), bicuculline (0.32, 0.64 and 1.25 mg/kg) or yohimbine (0.16, 0.64 and 2.5 mg/kg). After saline, 33% of the rats selected the appropriate lever for pentylenetetrazol whereas selection of this lever was enhanced after Ro 15-1788, bicuculline or yohimbine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "Although anesthetics are known to cause respiratory and cardiovascular depression in humans, these adverse effects rarely have been investigated in laboratory rodents. This study evaluated the effects of four different injectable drugs, pentobarbital, fentanyl-droperidol (Innovar-Vet), ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of rats. Results showed marked acidosis, hypercarbia and hypoxia with high doses of Innovar-Vet, moderate respiratory depression with all dosages of pentobarbital and minimal respiratory depression with ketamine-xylazine and ketamine-diazepam. Innovar-Vet, ketamine-xylazine and pentobarbital caused profound hypotension, particularly at high dosages, while ketamine-diazepam caused the least depression in mean arterial blood pressure of all drugs evaluated. None of the drugs studied produced significant alterations in heart rate. Throughout all dosages investigated, the ketamine-diazepam combination showed the least overall effects on ventilation and perfusion of the four parenteral drug combinations studied.", 
    "25": "This study investigated the possible analgesic effect of midazolam as a result of interruption of those spinal cord pathways taken by pain afferents. Experiments were performed on 15 male Wistar rats with chronically implanted lumbar subarachnoid catheters. The threshold for pain induced by brief passage of electric current between pairs of electrodes placed on the tail and the skin of the neck was measured before and after subarachnoid injections of midazolam. Intrathecal midazolam caused a significant (P less than 0.02) increase in the threshold for pain in the tail, but not in the neck; this response was not produced by intrathecal injections of vehicle and was blocked by prior intraperitoneal injections of the benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788. We also performed experiments on frog sciatic nerves which showed that midazolam did not have a local anaesthetic action. We conclude that intrathecal midazolam causes spinally-mediated analgesia by binding to benzodiazepine receptors in the spinal cord.", 
    "26": "The action of specific benzodiazepine (BD) antagonist R015-1788 and peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (BDR) ligand R05-4864 on the evoked activity of hippocampal neurons was studied using brain slice method. The extracellular activity was registered in CAI area upon single and paired pulse stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. R015-1788 application (5 microM, for 3-6 min) reduced paired pulse inhibition (PPI). More prolonged application produced a depression of the population spike (PS). R015-1788 (5 microM) blocked diazepam (2 microM), hexobarbital (10 microM) and GABA (40 microM) potentiation of PPI. Interaction of R015-1788 with endogenous BD-like ligand as a possible explanation for the effects under study is discussed. R05-4864 (10 microM) reduced PPI and decreased PS evoked by single pulse stimulation. Frequency stimulation revealed the generation of additional PS after drug application. The data presented suggest that suppression of hippocampal inhibitory circuits may be a general feature of anxiogenic BDR ligands.", 
    "27": "The authors evaluated preoperative sedation, intraoperative analgesia, and psychometric integrity resiliency of 98 female patients who underwent voluntary interruption of pregnancy. These women, with a mean age of 27.5 years (range of 19-35) received Clotiazepam or Flunitrazepam during the preanesthesia. The patients were administered the Zazzo \"deux barrages\" test. The 1st 2 parameters did not show any difference between the groups, whereas the patients treated with Clotiazepam recovered their pschometric abilities significantly more quickly than the patients treated with Flunitrazepam. Side effects were mild, equally present in both groups, and likely attributable to the intraoperative medication. The results suggest that short 1/2-life benzodiazepines like Clotiazepam are 1st choice drugs for the preanesthesia of short surgical operations.", 
    "28": "The effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats. Intravenous administration of diazepam (1-30 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. Also, reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam, although causing no change in the adrenaline-induced pressor effect, did enhance the adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia. However, the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin (an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex). The data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure.", 
    "29": "1. Cardiovascular orthostatic reflexes have been studied at night in 12 healthy male subjects who were given two soft gelatin capsules each containing 0 or 10 mg temazepam at 21.30 h. 2. The changes in heart rate, blood pressure and forearm blood flow on consecutive 5 min exposures to lower body negative pressure (suction) at 30, 40 and 50 mm Hg were measured before and then 1.5 and 9.5 h after giving doses of 10 or 20 mg temazepam in a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study. 3. Pre-suction resting values were not affected by temazepam, but 1.5 h after giving the capsules there were significant differences in the responses to suction between the placebo and 20 mg temazepam experiments: the tachycardia after 20 mg temazepam was about one-third greater and the forearm vasoconstriction was about 50% less. The effect of the 10 mg dose was equivocal. No residual effects were detected the next morning. 4. These alterations in orthostatic reflexes soon after the administration of temazepam at night did not impair the maintenance of arterial blood pressure in these healthy subjects.", 
    "30": "The anti-ulcer action of clotiazepam (a thienodiazepine derivative) was studied in mice subjected to non-physical and physical stimuli in a communication box. There were two groups of mice: the \"sender\" mice that received electric shocks on the feet and responded by squealing and jumping, and the \"responder\" mice that were affected by the senders' responses without receiving shocks on the feet. Gastric ulcers resulted in both groups. The effect of clotiazepam was compared with that of diazepam. The incidence of gastric ulcers was suppressed by clotiazepam at a dose of 3 mg/kg, per os, in \"responder\" and \"sender\" mice, and by diazepam at a dose of 1 mg/kg, per os, in \"responder\" mice. These results suggest that clotiazepam has a suppressive action against gastric ulcers produced by non-physical or physical stimuli, although its potency is slightly weaker than that of diazepam.", 
    "31": "Possible functional coupling between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors was examined using a purified GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. The purified receptor complex was obtained by 1012-S-acetamide adipic hydrazide Sepharose 4B affinity column chromatography, following the solubilization of synaptic membrane from the bovine cerebral cortex with Nonidet P-40. The binding of [3H]GABA to the purified GABA receptor was displaced significantly by muscimol and bicuculline, GABAA receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively, but not by baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist. On the other hand, the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the purified benzodiazepine receptor was found to be displaced by microM ranges of CL 218,872, which is known to be sensitive to the benzodiazepine type II receptor. Furthermore, it was found that the binding of [3H]muscimol to these purified GABAA receptors was enhanced by benzodiazepines, while the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to these benzodiazepine type II receptors was increased by GABA receptor agonists. These enhancements by GABA agonists and benzodiazepine agonists were found to be blocked by bicuculline and a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro15-1788, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the purified receptor may consist of GABAA and benzodiazepine type II receptors and possess a functional coupling of these sites, as shown in cerebral synaptic membranes.", 
    "32": "In the present study, a simulation was made of the time-course of the plasma levels of bentazepam, administered orally at a dose of 25 mg with dosage intervals of 8, 12 and 24 h over 5 days of treatment. The pharmacokinetic parameters corresponding to a single-compartment model were calculated in a previous study with 10 patients who received the drug in a multiple dosage regimen, using all the data relating to plasma levels even though they corresponded to different administrations, by non-linear regression employing programs based on homoscedastic, heteroscedastic and bayesian estimation methods. The mean values of the kinetic parameters obtained previously and used in the present study were as follows: for the absorption constant, mean values of 2.33, 2.18 and 2.75 h-1 were used; for the elimination constant, the values used were 0.10, 0.09 and 0.22 h-1 and for the apparent distribution volume, the values used were 1.89, 2.89 and 0.80 l/kg, with each of the above-mentioned calculation programs, respectively. The highest value for the maximum concentration at steady state proved to be 313.2 ng/ml for a dosage interval of 8 h according to the parameters established with the program using homoscedastic estimation. In the same case (homoscedastic estimation) the highest value of the minimum at steady state was 168.7 ng/ml. By contrast, the lowest value of the maximum value at steady state--129.3 ng/ml--was obtained with a dosage interval of 24 h using the parameters of the heteroscedastic estimation method, while the lowest value of the corresponding minimum was also observed for an interval of 24 h but using the parameters of the bayesian estimation; this was 2.8 ng/ml.", 
    "33": "The effects of pretreatment with varying doses of sufentanil on the subsequent induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone, methohexitone or midazolam were studied in 240 healthy patients. The induction dose requirements for the barbiturates were significantly reduced by sufentanil 5.0 micrograms (methohexitone p less than 0.05, thiopentone p less than 0.01). Excitatory effects following methohexitone were decreased (p less than 0.01) but brief respiratory depression was increased in both cases. Midazolam onset time was reduced, as was the frequency of failed induction, after sufentanil 5.0 micrograms (p less than 0.01).",

The use of sedative/hypnotics is reviewed in the context of historical influences on prescribing practice and from a current neuroscience perspective.

    "35": "Behavioral and limited neurochemical evidence indicates possible links between the endogenous opiate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor systems. A previous study using in vitro techniques indicated that MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) and Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2), peptides with anti-opiate activity, enhanced GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding. To assess the activity of these peptides under in vivo conditions, we evaluated their effects on benzodiazepine receptor binding as determined by specific uptake of the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]-Ro15-1788. Tyr-MIF-1, at a dose of 1 mg/kg IP, significantly augmented benzodiazepine binding in cortex and hippocampus but not in cerebellum, hypothalamus, or pons-medulla. Increases in binding were due in large part to increased apparent affinity at the receptor. At none of the doses of MIF-1 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or at the highest (10 mg/kg) and lowest (0.1 mg/kg) doses of Tyr-MIF-1 was there any significant alteration in benzodiazepine binding in any region evaluated. These results indicate that peptide-benzodiazepine receptor interactions may also occur in vivo.", 
    "36": "Biochemical and electrophysiological studies have provided evidence that a complex comprising the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptor and the phencyclidine (PCP) recognition site exists in mammalian brain. This complex, which has been compared to that established for the inhibitory amino acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, diazepam, is sensitive to the effects of the divalent cation Mg2+, which has suggested the presence of a third, ion channel component. Using a radioreceptor assay for the PCP receptor, L-glutamate (L-Glu) produced a concentration-dependent increase in the binding of [3H]thienyl cyclohexylpiperazine ([3H]TCP) in well washed membranes from rat forebrain. The EAA produced a maximal increase in specific binding of 400%, with an EC50 value of 340 nM. The ability of L-Glu to enhance [3H]TCP binding was 10-fold more potent in the presence of 30 microM Mg2+, which inhibits NMDA-evoked responses in intact tissue preparations and produces a 50% increase in [3H]TCP binding on its own. Analysis of saturation curves indicated that the effect of both L-Glu and Mg2+ could be attributed to an increase in receptor affinity as well as increases in the proportion of a high affinity state of the PCP-binding site. Assessment of the effect of a number of EAAs on basal [3H]TCP binding (well washed membranes in the absence of either L-Glu or Mg2+) showed that the EAA recognition site involved in the effects of L-Glu was the NMDA subtype. Further studies examined a series of compounds thought to interact with either the NMDA or PCP components of the receptor complex under four binding conditions: basal, +Mg2+; +L-Glu; and +Mg2+/L-Glu. These results showed that dissociative anesthetics, such as dexoxadrol and PCP, as well as the novel anticonvulsant MK-801, selectively interact with the high affinity state of the PCP receptor. NMDA antagonists, such as CPP, were also found to inhibit binding to the high affinity state of the PCP receptor, although not as potently as the dissociative anesthetics. Interestingly, the NMDA antagonists did not inhibit any of the binding to the low affinity state of the receptor. The sigma ligands (+/-)-SKF 10,047 and haloperidol recognized two components of [3H]TCP binding only in the presence of L-Glu. The results of the present study are consistent with the finding that agonists of the NMDA receptor induce a high affinity state of the PCP receptor.", 
    "37": "Rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate intragastrically administered d-amphetamine (AMPH) or pentobarbital (PENTO) from saline using a signaled shock-avoidance trail procedure. All monkeys maintained criterion levels (greater than 90% drug-appropriate responding) throughout the duration of the study during training sessions. In the AMPH experiment, the anorectics diethylpropion, mazindol, phendimetrazine, phenmetrazine and phentermine completely substituted for the training dose of AMPH. The atypical antidepressant bupropion and the psychomotor stimulant methylphenidate also completely substituted for AMPH. Other anorectics including benzphetamine, clortermine, fenetylline, mefenorex and the psychomotor stimulant pemoline that share some pharmacological properties with AMPH substituted for AMPH in some, but not all, of the monkeys tested. The anorectics fenfluramine and chlorphentermine failed to substitute for AMPH. Drugs from other pharmacological classes such as morphine, diazepam, nortripyline and PENTO also failed to substitute for AMPH, indicating pharmacological specificity. In the PENTO experiment, the benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, halazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam, temazepam and triazolam and the sedatives methaqualone and phenobarbital completely substituted for the training dose of PENTO. The nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic CL 218,872 only partially substituted for PENTO. In addition, morphine and AMPH failed to substitute for PENTO, indicating pharmacological specificity. In summary, drugs delivered intragastrically functioned as discriminative stimuli in a drug-class specific manner. The ability to use drugs delivered by this route as discriminative stimuli provides a way to compare anorectic drugs to AMPH or sedative drugs to PENTO under conditions that resemble the mode of human consumption to determine whether these drugs are likely to be associated with AMPH-like or PENTO-like drug dependence.", 
    "38": "Although short-term therapy for patients with anxiety disorders has been the accepted mode of therapy, it has become increasingly evident that certain patients with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and chronic illness may require longer-term therapy. Therapeutic goals for such patients include reducing anxiety symptoms, returning the patient to normal or near-normal functioning, and improving quality of life. Clinicians must choose the appropriate drug regimen with regard to duration, continuous versus intermittent treatment, and administration on a daily versus as-needed basis. Because of the nature of some anxiety disorders, intermittent therapy very often may be preferred. Benzodiazepines are highly effective and safe anxiolytics, but with continuous use these agents have demonstrated psychologic and physical dependence problems. Other agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, also relieve anxiety, although they have been shown to be unsuited for indiscriminate use. Buspirone, a newer anxiolytic, seems to be both effective and without abuse or dependence potential. In all cases, the prudent clinician should combine good patient management within the context of a good doctor-patient relationship.", 
    "39": "The use of benzodiazepine anxiolytic therapy has sometimes been associated with certain adverse reactions. The authors discuss the extent to which the clinician is responsible for warning patients that benzodiazepine therapy may result in addiction, withdrawal problems, and/or impaired cognitive and motor skills. The development of new anxiolytics such as buspirone, which seem to exert less effect on cognitive and motor skills and lack addiction potential (and thus withdrawal problems), presents the clinician with a treatment alternative. The authors review two legal cases involving benzodiazepine-induced driving impairment and discuss whether the clinician is obligated to prescribe the agent that generally demonstrates the least interference with such common activities as driving. Primary issues that arise in the discussion of physician responsibility are informed consent (both verbal and written) and the documentation of all treatment decisions. The authors recommend quality care and individualized treatment to avoid liability.", 
    "40": "Results of laboratory and epidemiologic studies have raised concern that psychotropic drugs may contribute to accidents. This article reviews studies of the effects of minor tranquilizer and antidepressant drugs on psychomotor performance. Data clearly demonstrate that the most commonly prescribed tranquilizer, diazepam, impairs many aspects of psychomotor performance for several hours after dosing, and there is no evidence that behavioral tolerance develops with continued drug use or that patients are differently affected than nonpatients. Lorazepam similarly impairs psychomotor performance. Other frequently prescribed benzodiazepine drugs have not been sufficiently examined to warrant conclusions about their psychomotor effects. A newly marketed nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic, buspirone, has been shown to have few effects on performance skills. Only one antidepressant, amitriptyline, has been studied thoroughly enough to conclude that it impairs psychomotor performance. The few studies of other, newer antidepressants suggest they may cause less impairment; however, more research is needed to confirm this.", 
    "41": "Benzodiazepine tranquilizers have been found to cause psychomotor and cognitive impairment, and there is evidence of an increased rate of automobile accidents among users of these drugs. To determine whether benzodiazepine users are more likely than nonusers to experience accidental injury requiring medical attention, we examined health-care utilization among 7,271 such users and an age- and sex-matched sample of 65,439 nonusers, all of whom were enrolled in an \"HMO-like\" health insurance plan. Benzodiazepine users and nonusers were identified through a review of 4 months' prescription drug claims. Six months' health-care claims for each user and nonuser subsequent to the first observed claim for a benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine agent, respectively, were compiled. Claims related to accidents were identified on the basis of physician-recorded diagnoses. Our results indicate that benzodiazepine users were significantly (p less than .01) more likely than nonusers to experience (1) at least one accident-related episode of care; (2) a greater number of accident-related hospital admissions; and (3) a greater number of accident-related inpatient days. Accident-related utilization was also significantly higher when users had recently filled a prescription for a benzodiazepine agent. Benzodiazepine users, however, also utilized significantly more non-accident-related health-care services than nonusers. The nature of the association between benzodiazepine use and a higher accident-related utilization is thus unclear. A pretest-posttest study is now being undertaken to ascertain the significance of these findings.", 
    "42": "Although widespread use has confirmed their efficacy as anxiolytic agents, the benzodiazepine drugs are indicated only for short-term or intermittent therapy at as low a therapeutic dose as possible because of their liability for causing dependence or abuse. When first introduced, benzodiazepine drugs appeared to be therapeutically equal or superior to barbiturate agents, while causing fewer side effects, being safer in overdose, and producing fewer dependence and abuse problems. Although benzodiazepine drugs have become the most commonly prescribed anxiolytic agents, evidence has emerged that their use in long-term therapy can cause severe withdrawal problems, even when relatively low doses are used or when the drug is discontinued gradually. Based on results from both animal models and clinical investigations, buspirone appears to be as effective in treating anxiety as the benzodiazepine drugs while causing fewer withdrawal problems. Data suggest no appreciable propensity to cause physical dependence or abuse associated with buspirone therapy. The drug demonstrates no cross-tolerance with either the barbiturate agents or the benzodiazepine drugs and seems to be a dysphoriant at high doses rather than a euphoriant. Although buspirone seems to be an appropriate drug for patients requiring longer-term anxiolytic therapy, careful monitoring for withdrawal problems and other adverse side effects is essential as buspirone is introduced to successive markets.", 
    "43": "TRH receptors have been solubilized from GH4C1 cells using the plant glycoside digitonin. Solubilized receptors retain the principal binding characteristics exhibited by the TRH receptor in intact pituitary cells and their membranes. The binding of the methylhistidyl derivative of TRH [( 3H]MeTRH) attained equilibrium within 2-3 h at 4 C, and it was reversible, dissociating with a t1/2 of 7 h. Analysis of [3H]MeTRH binding to soluble receptors at 4 C yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.8 nM and a total binding capacity (Bmax) of 3.9 pmol/mg protein. Peptides known to interact with non-TRH receptors on GH cells failed to interfere with the binding of [3H]MeTRH, indicating that the TRH binding was specific. Chlordiazepoxide, a competitive antagonist for TRH action in GH cells, inhibited TRH binding to soluble receptors with an IC50 of 11 microM. When [3H]MeTRH was bound to membranes and the membrane proteins were then solubilized, we found enhanced dissociation of the prebound [3H]MeTRH from its solubilized receptor by guanyl nucleotides. Maximal enhancement of [3H]MeTRH dissociation by 10 microM GTP gamma S occurred within about 45 min at 22 C. GTP gamma S, GTP, GDP beta S, and GDP were all effectors of [3H]MeTRH dissociation, exhibiting EC50s in the range of 14-450 nM. The rank order of potency of the tested nucleotides was GTP gamma S greater than GTP congruent to GDP beta S greater than GDP much greater than ATP gamma S greater than GMP. We conclude that TRH receptors have been solubilized from GH cells with digitonin and retain the binding characteristics of TRH receptors in intact pituitary cells. Furthermore, prebinding [3H]MeTRH to GH4C1 cell membranes results in the solubilization of a complex in which the TRH receptor is linked functionally to a GTP binding protein.", 
    "44": "Stress alters cellular immunity, affecting lymphocyte function, total lymphocyte count, and the frequency distribution of the lymphocyte subpopulations. Cortisol may mediate these stress-related changes, and drugs affecting cortisol levels might therefore alter lymphocyte patterns. Etomidate and midazolam both prevent the normal perioperative cortisol increase in minor surgery, but the mechanisms by which they do this are not identical: etomidate inhibits steroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex, leading to low cortisol and high ACTH levels, whereas midazolam primarily prevents ACTH increases. Methohexital has little or no influence on cortisol levels. By comparing the effects of these three drugs on the expression of lymphocyte surface markers and the interleukin-2 (Il-2) receptor, we hoped to gain further information on the effects of perioperative cortisol changes on cellular immunity. METHODS. Healthy, young male patients scheduled for routine body surface operations were premedicated with 2 mg flunitrazepam the evening before surgery and 50 mg promethazine and 15 mg piritramide i.m. 1 h before arrival in the operating room. Anaesthesia was induced with 0.2-0.3 mg fentanyl, 2 mg pancuronium, and either etomidate (0.3 mg/kg body wt.), midazolam (0.2 mg/kg body wt.), or methohexital (1.5 mg/kg body wt.). The induction bolus was followed by an infusion at the rate of 0.36 mg/kg/h for etomidate, 0.09 mg/kg/h for midazolam, and no infusion for methohexital. Intubation was facilitated with 100 mg succinylcholine. The patients were ventilated to normocapnia with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Fentanyl was given as 0.1 mg bolus injections whenever necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Cultured neurons from embryonic rat brain display central type benzodiazepine receptors characterized by high-affinity binding of [3H]flunitrazepam which is allosterically enhanced in the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). A 48 h treatment of the cultured neurons with 1 microM diazepam, 0.1 microM clonazepam or 0.1 microM beta-carboline ester derivatives did not change either Bmax or KD values of the [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding. A 48 h incubation in the presence of GABA (1 mM) or muscimol (0.1 mM) induced a 30% decrease of the Bmax value of [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding without change of the KD value. The down-regulation was dependent on GABA concentrations and temperature, and was partially inhibited by bicuculline but not by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. The other subunits of the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel receptor complex also seemed to be down-regulated by GABA since there was a decrease of the specific binding of [3H]muscimol and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to the GABAA and chloride channel sites respectively. The GABA-induced down-regulation of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor seems to be selective since the specific binding of ligands to other receptors was not affected. Our results suggests that activation of the low-affinity GABA subunit which is involved in cellular electrophysiological responses, induced the receptor down-regulation.", 
    "46": "Two novel imidazobenzodiazepines, Ro16-6028 and Ro17-1812, have been described recently as partial agonists acting at benzodiazepine receptors. In a test of palatable food consumption using nondeprived rats, Ro16-6028 (0.01-10 mg/kg) and Ro17-1812 (0.01-10 mg/kg) were shown to produce dose-dependent increases in food intake. Ro16-6028 was more potent than Ro17-1812. Suriclone, midazolam, and the beta-carbolines ZK 93423 and ZK 91296 also significantly increased food intake. The maximum effects of Ro16-6028 and Ro17-1812 were at least equivalent to those obtained with full agonists acting at benzodiazepine sites. Neither Ro16-6028 nor Ro17-1812 reduced locomotion or rearing frequency in an open field test, although there was a reduction in grooming frequency. In contrast, the full agonist midazolam dose-dependently reduced all measures of general activity. The results indicate that some novel benzodiazepine partial agonists strongly stimulate food intake in the absence of side effects typical of the classical benzodiazepines.", 
    "47": "1 Intraperitoneal injection to mice of the gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) receptor agonist (+/-)-baclofen induces a dose-dependent decrease in rectal temperature. 2 Injection of (-)-baclofen intracerebroventricularly at doses that had no effect when given peripherally induced a marked hypothermia. (+)-Baclofen was without effect. 3 The decrease in rectal temperature induced by (-)-baclofen when injected intraperitoneally was highly correlated with an increase in sedation. 4 Repeated administration of amitriptyline (10 mg kg-1 daily for 14 days) resulted in mice displaying an enhanced temperature and sedation response to injection of (+/-)-baclofen (5 mg kg-1) 24 h after the last dose of antidepressant. 5 An enhanced hypothermic response was also seen following repeated administration of zimeldine, mianserin or desipramine (all 10 mg kg-1 daily for 14 days) or repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS; 5 ECS over 10 days) 24 h after the last treatment. 6 A single administration of any of the antidepressant drugs or ECS or repeated administration of the anxiolytic drug flurazepam (20 mg kg-1 daily for 14 days) did not alter the baclofen-induced hypothermic response. 7 Administration of (+/-)-baclofen (5 mg kg-1) daily for 5 or 14 days attenuated the baclofen-induced hypothermic response. However, one pretreatment dose did not alter the response. 8 It has previously been reported that repeated baclofen administration decreases GABAB receptor number in the brain while repeated administration of antidepressant drugs and ECS increases the density of this receptor. The current data therefore suggest that baclofen-induced hypothermia may provide a simple index of GABAB receptor function in the brain and strengthens the evidence that GABAB receptor function is enhanced by antidepressant drugs and ECS.", 
    "48": "The possible mediation of muscarinic and/or nicotinic-cholinergic receptors in the response of ACTH to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was evaluated in 18 normal men. Subjects were tested with the insulin (0.15 U/kg) tolerance test (ITT) in basal conditions and in the presence of the M1- and M2-muscarinic antagonist atropine (600 micrograms iv just before insulin injection (time 0) plus 600 micrograms 20 min later in 6 subjects) or the M1-muscarinic receptor blocker pirenzepine (40 mg iv 10 min before ITT or 20 mg at time 0 plus 30 mg at time 20 in 6 subjects). The remaining 6 men were treated with the nicotinic receptor antagonist trimethaphan (0.3 mg/min x 30 min before ITT). ACTH rose 4.7 times in response to hypoglycaemia. The ACTH response to hypoglycaemia did not change after pirenzepine administration, whereas it was significantly increased by atropine and decreased by trimethaphan treatment. These data indicate that nicotinic and muscarinic (M2 but not M1) receptors participate in a different manner in the regulation of the hypoglycaemia-induced ACTH release.", 
    "49": "Two behavioral tests, motor activity and the acoustic startle response (ASR), were used to test for dose-addition of cismethrin, a Type I, or deltamethrin, a Type II pyrethroid, with compounds active at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor complex (picrotoxin, muscimol and chlordiazepoxide). Additivity was assessed using a simplified version of isobolographic analysis using chlorpromazine and haloperidol as positive controls for dose-additivity. Dosage-effect functions for all compounds were determined for both motor activity and the ASR. The effects of various combinations of chlorpromazine (0.5-4.0 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) on motor activity indicate dose-addition. To test for dose-addition of pyrethroids and GABAergic compounds, cismethrin (3-18 mg/kg) or deltamethrin (2-6 mg/kg) were administered 90 min before testing, either alone, or before treatment with picrotoxin (0.25-2.0 mg/kg), muscimol (0.6-2.5 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg/kg) administered 20 to 30 min before testing. All compounds produced dosage-dependent decreases in motor activity. Muscimol and picrotoxin decreased ASR amplitude, increased ASR latency and reduced ASR sensitization to increasing background noise levels. Chlordiazepoxide had no effect on any measure of the ASR. Results from the interaction studies indicate dose-addition of the effects of picrotoxin and deltamethrin on motor activity and the ASR. Additivity of dose was not seen with any other combination. These data suggest that the in vivo effects of the Type II pyrethroid deltamethrin may be due in part to interaction with the picrotoxinin binding site of the GABAA receptor-ionophore complex. In addition, these results are consistent with reported differential effects of the two classes of pyrethroids on the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "50": "1. In the search to identify peripheral toxins which could be responsible for the supersensitivity of brain benzodiazepine receptors in experimental models of hepatic encephalopathy, [3H]diazepam-binding studies have been performed on brain tissues of normal rats treated with ammonium chloride, dimethyldisulphide and octanoic acid administered alone or in combination. 2. The subacute administration of the three toxins in combination induced a 30% increase in the number of benzodiazepine recognition sites. The administration of these toxins alone or in combination showed that this increase was mainly linked to the synergistic action of dimethyldisulphide or octanoic acid with ammonia, since dimethyldisulphide plus octanoic acid was ineffective. 3. These observations seem to reinforce the suggestion that these three toxins are able to induce neurochemical derangements similar to those described in experimental hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "51": "Central and peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites were studied in vitro after the administration of GABAA and GABAB agonists. Cerebral cortex and kidney homogenates were used in this study. Muscimol (1.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) pretreatment significantly increased the affinity of benzodiazepine binding sites not only in the cerebral cortex but also in the kidneys. Similar changes were obtained with (-) and (+) baclofen (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), with the only exception that (-) baclofen in addition to changes in the affinity caused a marked decrease in the number of binding sites in both structures studied. The mechanism of action of GABA agonists on peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites is discussed.", 
    "52": "The two avian benzodiazepine binding proteins offer an opportunity for further studies concerning their regional variation and their phylo- and ontogenetic development. Accordingly, regional variation of the benzodiazepine binding proteins is investigated further in two reptiles and chicken using photoaffinity labeling with [3H]flunitrazepam followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Whereas regional heterogeneity is pronounced in chicken, it is not readily apparent in the two reptiles. The ontogeny of the benzodiazepine binding proteins in chicken forebrain and cerebellum is remarkably similar to that previously reported in rodents. The results are discussed in light of the possible existence of the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor as an isoreceptor complex.", 
    "53": "The peptides Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) and, to a lesser extent, MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) recently have been found to augment the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on benzodiazepine receptor binding at the GABAA receptor complex. To assess their interaction with the chloride channel binding site on the GABAA receptor, we evaluated the effects of these two peptides on [35S]-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding in mouse brain membranes. In cortex, neither peptide altered [35S]-TBPS binding over a broad dose range, but Tyr-MIF-1 significantly augmented displacement of radioligand binding by the GABA analog muscimol at peptide concentrations of 10(-10) to 10(-7) M; MIF-1 had little effect on muscimol displacement of [35S]-TBPS binding. In cerebellum and brainstem, neither peptide was active in altering muscimol displacement of binding. Thus, Tyr-MIF-1 augments the displacement of [35S]-TBPS binding by the GABA analog muscimol in mouse brain cortical membranes, indicating that this peptide enhances the effects of GABA at the chloride channel as well as at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "54": "The effects of chemically and electrically-evoked seizures on [3H]nitrendipine binding to voltage-dependent calcium channels in mouse brain were determined 30 and 60 min following the initiation of convulsions. While maximal electroconvulsive shock, pentylenetetrazol and strychnine exhibited either no or marginal effects, Ro 5-4864 produced a decrease (14%) in the Bmax of [3H]nitrendipine at 30 min but not 60 min. The convulsant dihydropyridine calcium channel activator, BAY K 8644, produced a significant increase in the Kd (31%) of [3H]nitrendipine at 30 min, and a significant increase in both the Bmax (21%) and Kd (28%) of [3H]nitrendipine 60 min following the initiation of convulsions. While maximal electroconvulsive shock, pentylenetetrazol and strychnine exhibited either no or marginal effects, Ro 5-4864 produced a decrease (14%) in the Bmax of [3H]nitrendipine at 30 min but not 60 min following the initiation of convulsions. These findings indicate that modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by certain convulsants may be important in the genesis of seizures or in post-ictal compensatory processes.", 
    "55": "Chick brain mRNA was isolated and injected into Xenopus oocytes. This led to the expression of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) channels easily accessible for current measurements using the voltage clamp technique. The effect of the anthelmintic natural product avermectin B1a on the GABA current was studied quantitatively. In the presence of the drug, GABA-induced chloride currents were strongly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal stimulation of the current evoked by 5 microM GABA was found with about 0.1 microM avermectin B1a. Avermectin B1a did not affect the reversal potential of the current or the maximal response elicited by GABA, and did not alter the membrane permeability in the absence of GABA. The major effects of avermectin B1a were a shift of the Ka for GABA from 21 microM to 2 microM, and a decrease of the apparent Hill coefficient for GABA from 1.7 to 1.1. Furthermore, in the presence of avermectin B1a, desensitization of the GABA current was strongly inhibited. The benzodiazepine-binding site ligand Ro 15-1788 did not affect the action of avermectin B1a if present at concentrations up to 1 microM. The stimulatory effects of the drug were additive to the ones by the barbiturate pentobarbital, if both agents were added at low concentrations. At higher concentrations each of these agents inhibited the stimulatory effects of the other.",

The anxiolytic benzodiazepine flunitrazepam increased the channel opening frequency, but it did not change conductance or channel opening burst duration. The anxiogenic compound methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated Cl- channel opening frequency without changing conductance or opening duration. An increase and decrease in the number of channel bursts were elicited by flunitrazepam and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, respectively. The effects of both drugs were antagonized by ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5][1,4] -benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (flumazenil), a benzodiazepine antagonist, which per se failed to modify Cl- channel kinetics and conductance.", 
    "57": "A method for anaesthetising pregnant guinea pigs is described which makes one hour available for abdominal surgery and subsequent recovery; it uses a combination of fentanyl, fluanisone and diazepam with atropine, prednisolone and glucose saline. Provided anaesthesia was performed no later than the 48th day of gestation, 85 per cent of pregnancies continued to term and 74 per cent of the pups survived the first 24 hours after birth.", 
    "58": "In a prospective study of 282 chronic alcoholics and 67 opiate addicts, frequency and pattern of drug intake were determined by questioning and urinalysis on admission to a special unit of a psychiatric hospital. 20.2% of alcoholics and 44.8% of opiate addicts stated that they had taken psychotropic drugs before admission, women in both groups naming such drugs significantly more frequently than men. But taking into account results of urinalysis, 25.5% of alcoholics and 31.3% of opiate addicts were found to have taken benzodiazepines before hospital admission. 41.8% of opiate addicts either stated or were found to have taken barbiturates. High dosages of benzodiazepines were found in those alcoholics who had mentioned taking them. Thus in practice the treatment of addicts differs markedly from recommendations made by well-known experts. There is also a need to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of addicts.", 
    "59": "A method for the identification and differentiation of the following benzodiazepines and their metabolites in urine after acid hydrolysis and acetylation is described: bromazepam, camazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, clonazepam, clorazepate, clotiazepam, cloxazolam, delorazepam, diazepam, ethylloflazepate, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, metaclazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, oxazolam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam and tetrazepam. The acetylated extract was analysed by computerized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. An on-line computer allowed rapid detection using ion chromatography with ions m/z 205, 211, 230, 241, 245, 249, 312 and 333. The identity of positive signals in the reconstructed ion chromatogram was confirmed by a comparison of the stored full mass spectra with reference spectra. The ion chromatograms, reference mass spectra and gas chromatographic retention indices (on OV-101) are documented.", 
    "60": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of triazolam and its main metabolites (1-hydroxymethyltriazolam and 4-hydroxytriazolam) in human urine has been developed. After hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase, the unchanged drug and its metabolites were extracted with a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and further purified by a Sep-Pak silica cartridge. The extract was chromatographed on a reversed-phase column using a mobile phase consisting of methanol-10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8 (65:35) and UV detection at 220 nm. The overall recoveries of triazolam, 1-hydroxymethyltriazolam and 4-hydroxytriazolam were ca. 88, 75 and 75%, respectively, and the detection limits of these compounds were 5 ng/ml, using a 10-ml specimen.", 
    "61": "Sixty-nine patients with symptomatic and endoscopically diagnosed gastric or duodenal ulcers received treatment with either pirenzepine 100 mg or cimetidine 800 mg one hour before bedtime in a prospective randomised, double blind study. Fifty-five patients completed the six weeks treatment period of whom 13/15 (87%) gastric ulcers and 13/16 (81%) duodenal ulcers, healed with pirenzepine compared to 8/11 (73%) gastric ulcers and 10/13 (77%) duodenal ulcers treated with cimetidine for the same period. The differences in healing rates between pirenzepine and cimetidine were not statistically significant. Pirenzepine 100 mg administered at night is therefore an effective treatment for gastric and duodenal ulcers.", 
    "62": "Postnatal handling of rat pups alters their response to novelty. We have now shown that, as adults, rats handled for the first three weeks of life showed a suppression of feeding in a novel environment that was less, and a [3H]flunitrazepam binding in whole brain that was greater than in non-handled animals. These data suggest that variations in benzodiazepam binding capacity could be related to individual differences in the fear response to novelty.", 
    "63": "The distribution of muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors was investigated in the turtle forebrain by the technique of in vitro receptor autoradiography. Muscarinic binding sites were labeled with 1 nM 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB), and benzodiazepine sites were demonstrated with the aid of 1 nM 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FLU). Autoradiograms generated on 3H-Ultrofilm apposed to tissue slices revealed regionally specific distributions of muscarinic and benzodiazepine binding sites that are comparable with those for mammalian brain. Dense benzodiazepine binding was found in the anterior olfactory nucleus, the lateral and dorsal cortices, and the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), a structure with no clear mammalian homologue. Muscarinic binding sites were most dense in the striatum, accumbens, DVR, lateral geniculate, and the anterior olfactory nucleus. Cortical binding sites were studied in greater detail by quantitative analysis of autoradiograms generated by using emulsion-coated coverslips. Laminar gradients of binding were observed that were specific for each radioligand; 3H-QNB sites were most dense in the inner molecular layer in all cortical regions, whereas 3H-FLU binding was generally most concentrated in the outer molecular layer and was least dense through all layers in the dorsomedial cortex. Because pyramidal cells are arranged in register in turtle cortex, the laminar patterns of receptor binding may reflect different receptor density gradients along pyramidal cell dendrites.", 
    "64": "Amygdala kindling in rats represents an animal model of partial epilepsy with secondary generalization. Benzodiazepines are active against this type of epilepsy in man but their usefulness is limited by the development of tolerance. This study examined the effects of chronic treatment with the benzodiazepine clonazepam and the beta-carboline ZK 93423 (6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester), a full agonist at brain benzodiazepine receptors, on amygdala-kindled seizures in rats. The pharmacokinetics as well as the acute anticonvulsant potency of the drugs were determined prior to the chronic experiments. Based on the data thus obtained clonazepam and ZK 93423 were administered 3 times daily at a dose of 1 or 5 mg/kg i.p., respectively, for 2 weeks. During this treatment period, both compounds significantly reduced seizure severity without indication of tolerance. However, the marked initial effects on seizure duration and/or duration of afterdischarges recorded from the amygdala were attenuated or lost during the 2 weeks of treatment. A pronounced tolerance was also observed with respect to side-effects (sedation, ataxia, muscle relaxation) occurring during treatment. Plasma drug level determinations suggested that the tolerance was of functional nature. The data indicate that, compared to benzodiazepines, the beta-carboline ZK 93423 has no advantage in terms of anticonvulsant potency, side-effects and development of tolerance in the amygdala kindling model of epilepsy.", 
    "65": "The behavioral effects of several new anxiolytics and putative anxiolytics were evaluated in two tests sensitive for anxiolytic activity. In the first test, rats were trained to lever-respond for sweetened milk under a multiple variable-interval fixed-ratio (VI-FR) schedule of reinforcement. In the FR component a brief electric shock coincided with the presentation of reward (i.e. conflict procedure). Treatment of these rats with diazepam, tracazolate, CGS-9896, and the pyrimidinylpiperazine derivatives buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone (TVX Q 7821) significantly increased responding that was suppressed by foot-shock. A common metabolite of the pyrimidinylpiperazines, l-PP, had no affect on punished responding. A second group of rats was trained to discriminate diazepam from saline using a two-lever operant choice procedure. Diazepam-stimulus generalization occurred to CGS-9896, CL 218,872, zopiclone and tracazolate, but not to buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone or l-PP. It was concluded that while all of the new compounds examined appear to share an anxiolytic effect as demonstrated by their activity in the conflict procedure, the pyrimidinylpiperazine agents do not share discriminative stimulus properties which are common to drugs which act via the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "66": "Peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors are differentially modified by arachidonate, diethylpyrocarbonate and thiol reagents, as evidenced by the finding that binding of a proposed agonist ([3H]R05-4864) and a proposed antagonist ([3H]PK 11195) to rat kidney mitochondrial membranes can be modified separately. (1) Arachidonate significantly lowered the affinity of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor for R05-4864 and diazepam but did not alter the affinity for PK 11195 and only slightly altered for dipyridamole. In contrast, diethylpyrocarbonate inhibited [3H]PK 11195 binding by 43% while reducing [3H]R05-4864 binding only 16%. (2) Diethylpyrocarbonate treatment causes a reduction in affinity for both dipyridamole and PK 11195, did not change the affinities for R05-4864 and diazepam but increased the affinities for diuretics. PK 11195, R05-4864 and dipyridamole totally protected peripheral benzodiazepine receptors against inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate. In contrast, diethylpyrocarbonate inactivation of [3H]PK 11195 binding was increased after preincubation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors with metolazone. Arachidonate both lowers the affinity for [3H]R05-4864 and eliminated the ability of R05-4864 to protect peripheral benzodiazepine receptors against inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate. (3) Among different thiol reagents, only dithiothreitol treatment resulted in 26 and 43% inhibition of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]R05-4864 binding, respectively. These results indicate that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor molecule possesses at least two different conformations or separate mutually exclusive sites for agonists and antagonists. Additionally, the interaction of the thiazide class of diuretics with peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors seems to require binding sites on the receptor molecule in addition to those for specific agonist and antagonist, whereas dipyridamole appears to bind to the antagonist site or conformation.", 
    "67": "The effects of the benzodiazepine, medazepam, were investigated in current and voltage-clamped cultured chick dorsal root ganglion neurons. Under current clamp, micromolar concentrations initially elevated the action potential threshold and blocked both the sodium and calcium components of the spike. In voltage clamp, low (I(Ca.T)) and high (I(CA.N/L)) threshold calcium, sodium (I(Na)) and the delayed rectifier potassium (I(K)) currents were isolated by the use of appropriate solutions and voltage command protocols. Medazepam depressed both subtypes of I(Ca) equally well with calculated half-maximal depression at 77 microM. At a fixed concentration of 200 microM, medazepam depressed I(Na) (70 +/- 9%) and I(K) (73 +/- 6%) to a degree comparable to I(Ca) (75 +/- 3%). The results show that benzodiazepines can modulate the activity of several voltage-gated ion currents in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons.", 
    "68": "One hundred sixty-three patients with small cell lung cancer were treated with six courses, at 3-week intervals, of ifosfamide (5 g/m2) with mesna and etoposide. Thoracic radiotherapy was delivered to the limited stage (LS) patients. The complete response rate (CR, determined clinically and radiologically) was 76% for the 78 LS patients with a further 14% partial response (PR). The majority of the CRs were confirmed on a follow-up bronchoscopy. The CR rate was 27% for extensive stage (ES) patients with another 38% undergoing a partial response. The median survival for LS patients was 11 months, (16 months for CR confirmed by rebronchoscopy) and 8 months for ES patients. The 2-year actuarial survival for LS patients is 27%, follow-up ranges from 12 months to 30 months with a median of 22 months. Toxicity was not severe for the patient population, of whom only 20% had a good performance status before chemotherapy. Parental antibiotics were required on 4% of all 844 chemotherapy courses and 12% of courses were delayed due to side effects. The majority of responses occurred within the first two courses of chemotherapy and there was a corresponding improvement in the patients' symptoms and performance status. The regimen produced rapid tumor response with corresponding improvement in symptoms without marked toxicity and allowed further treatment development.", 
    "69": "We used radioligand binding and studies of cell contraction to characterize muscarinic receptors on dispersed smooth muscle cells from rabbit proximal and distal colon. Cells obtained after serial incubations in collagenase were used to measure binding of tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB). AT 37 degrees C, specific [3H]QNB binding was saturable and linearly related to cell number. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine the affinity of [3H]QNB for its receptor. In the distal colon the Kd was 60 pM, and the mean number of receptors was 1.2 X 10(6)/cell. Compared with cells from the distal colon, cells from the proximal colon had a lower affinity (Kd = 337 pM) but similar numbers of receptors. The concentrations of the antagonists atropine, secovorine, and pirenzepine, which were required for inhibition of 50% [3H]QNB binding (IC50), were 8, 5, and 870 nM, respectively, suggesting that the receptors are of the M2-muscarinic subclass. Hill coefficients for these agents were 1.1, 0.9, and 1.1, suggesting binding to a single receptor. The IC50 for the muscarinic agonists bethanechol and oxotremorine were 80 and 0.57 microM, respectively. Hill coefficients were 0.67 for both, suggesting more complex interactions involving receptors of different affinities. In studies of cell contraction, bethanechol stimulated a dose-dependent decrease in cell length with half the maximal contraction occurring at 100 pM. These results suggest that 1) contraction is mediated by binding of bethanechol to M2-muscarinic receptors and that 2) there are a large number of spare receptors in colonic smooth muscle.", 
    "70": "The binding characteristics of muscarinic receptors in rat salivary and lacrimal glands were studied by means of radioligand binding techniques. In competition experiments against [3H]N-methylscopolamine, classical muscarinic antagonists ipratropium bromide, N-methylscopolamine and N-methylatropine exhibited very similar KD values in all the glands and their binding behavior was well described by a one binding site model (nH congruent to 1). The novel cardioselective antimuscarinic compound, AF-DX 116, displayed an equally low affinity in all the tissues examined. Pirenzepine and dicyclomine, two other selective muscarinic antagonists, showed a similar behaviour in all but the sublingual gland, where their binding profile indicated the presence of a heterogeneous receptor population (nH = 0.74 and 0.84, respectively). Histological studies of the sublingual-submandibular glandular complex demonstrated the presence of ganglionic structures mainly located in the hilum of the sublingual-submandibular glandular complex connected with the sublingual gland. Binding studies carried out with pirenzepine on the hilum and on a synaptosomal preparation from this region again revealed the presence of two populations of muscarinic receptors with KD values of 22-25 and 270-463 nM. These results are best explained by the presence of M1 and M2 receptors located on neuronal and glandular structures.", 
    "71": "Baboons received continuous intragastric infusions of diazepam (20 mg/kg per day) for one or more months. While diazepam treatment continued, baboons received intragastric doses of Ro 15-1788 (0.032-32.0 mg/kg) or CGS 8216 (1.0-100.0 mg/kg) at intervals of two or more weeks. Baboons were observed following administration of these antagonists for the presence of precipitated withdrawal signs. The following results were obtained: (1) both Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 produced signs of precipitated withdrawal in the baboon; (2) a more severe overall withdrawal syndrome was precipitated with Ro 15-1788 than with CGS 8216 at testable doses; (3) Ro 15-1788 produced dose-related increases in the overall severity of withdrawal, while CGS 8216 did not produce a clear dose-related increase in the overall severity of withdrawal; (4) dose-effect curves for Ro 15-1788 for certain signs (e.g. limb-tremor) were monotonicly increasing, while for other signs dose-effect curves plateaued at lower doses of Ro 15-1788 (e.g. retching and vomiting) or were an inverted U-shape (e.g. scratching). CGS 8216 precipitated withdrawal signs were less clearly dose-dependent; (5) onset of Ro 15-1788 precipitated withdrawal signs were rapid (5-15 min) and reliable, while the onset of CGS 8216 precipitated withdrawal signs were generally slower (approximately 30 min) and more variable; (6) at doses of Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 that produced equal levels of vomiting and retching, Ro 15-1788 produced more limb-tremor than CGS 8216. These studies indicate that Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 may produce quantitatively and qualitatively different precipitated withdrawal syndromes.", 
    "72": "The antagonist binding properties of rat pancreatic and cardiac muscarinic receptors were compared. In both tissues pirenzepine (PZ) had a low affinity for muscarinic receptors labelled by (3H)N-methylscopolamine [3)NMS) (KD values of 140 and 280 nM, respectively, in pancreatic and cardiac homogenates). The binding properties of pancreatic and cardiac receptors were, however, markedly different. This was indicated by different affinities for dicyclomine, (11-([(2-[diethylamino)-methyl)-1-piperidinyl] acetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4) benzodiazepin-6-on) (AFDX-116), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) and hexahydrosiladifenidol (HHSiD). Pancreatic and cardiac muscarinic receptors also showed different (3H)NMS association and dissociation rates. These results support the concept of M2 receptor heterogeneity and confirm that M2 receptor subtypes have different binding kinetic properties.", 
    "73": "The effects of four tremorgenic and one nontremorgenic mycotoxins were studied on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor binding and function in rat brain and on binding of a voltage-operated Cl- channel in Torpedo electric organ. None of the mycotoxins had significant effect on [3H]muscimol or [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the GABAA receptor. However, only the four tremorgenic mycotoxins inhibited GABA-induced 36Cl- influx and [35S] t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) binding in rat brain membranes, while the nontremorgenic verruculotoxin had no effect. Inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding by paspalinine was non-competitive. This suggests that tremorgenic mycotoxins inhibit GABAA receptor function by binding close to the receptor's Cl- channel. On the voltage-operated Cl- channel, only high concentrations of verruculogen and verruculotoxin caused significant inhibition of the channel's binding of [35S]TBPS. The data suggest that the tremorgenic action of these mycotoxins may be due in part to their inhibition of GABAA receptor function.", 
    "74": "Ro 5-4864 (chlorodiazepam) increased coronary flow in isolated retrograde perfused Langendorff rat heart preparations without affecting heart rate and left ventricular contractility (dP/dt). On the other hand Ro 5-4023 (clonazepam) produced very little effect. PK 11195 which has been shown to inhibit the binding of Ro 5-4864 to cardiac muscle did not antagonize this vasodilatory effect of Ro 5-4864 but increased coronary flow by itself. The data indicate a specific vasodilatory effect of certain benzodiazepines. The mechanism of action remains unknown.", 
    "75": "The idea of ameliorating jetlag with drugs has received considerable attention. Melatonin has been found to reduce feelings of jetlag in people after transatlantic flights. In hamsters, injections of triazolam, a benzodiazepine, increase the rate of adjustment of activity rhythms to an 8 h advance of the light-dark (LD) cycle. But melatonin can make people drowsy and triazolam often induces hamsters to run in their wheels. Therefore, it is not clear whether these chemicals exert their chronotypic effects by acting directly on circadian pacemakers or because they first alter behavioural states. Non-photic behavioural events (for instance, social interactions) are capable of entraining rhythms and causing phase shifts. Thus, it is possible that behavioural events alone could alter the rate of adjustment to new LD cycles. To investigate this possibility, we studied the rate of re-entrainment of hamsters in a testing paradigm similar to that used with triazolam. We found that the rate of adjustment could be more than doubled simply by making the animals active on a single occasion in the middle of their normal rest period, immediately after the shift in the LD cycle.", 
    "76": "Drug therapy has a secondary function in the management of patients with alcoholism. The benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for treating alcohol withdrawal, especially initially, in a high-dose loading technique. The alcohol-sensitizing drugs disulfiram and calcium carbimide may help your patients to maintain abstinence, but full medical assessment of the patient and knowledge of the adverse effects of these drugs is required prior to their use. The management of the disulfiram ethanol reaction is described.", 
    "77": "The extensive use of benzodiazepines in treating anxiety and insomnia makes clinicians ask themselves about the risk of addiction relating to these drugs.(1-3) Indeed, it is estimated that in Canada, the United-States, and Western Europe, between 10% and 20% of persons use tranquilizers or hypnotics (mostly benzodiazepines) during a one-year period. Of these persons 70% are 50 years of age or more. It has been noted that 15% of those persons have been using these drugs for more than 12 months.(4, 5) In 1980, Tyrer reported that 50% of the patients who receive a prescription for benzodiazepines renew that prescription without consulting their physician.(6) In this article, the authors briefly review the dependency, risk factors and clinical signs resulting from withdrawal of these drugs. They also define a rational therapeutic approach to discontinuing their use.", 
    "78": "The epidemiology of 737 consecutive self-poisoning admissions to Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, has been investigated with reference to age in young (less than 35), mid-aged (35-64) and elderly (greater than or equal to 65 year) patients. The most important differences were increased formal psychiatric illness in the elderly, demonstrated by increased likelihood of admission to psychiatric units; less likelihood of overdose with multiple agents in the elderly, and less use of alcohol. There were also differences in the types of drugs used. The youngest patients took more paracetamol and less psychoactive drugs and more of their drugs were prescribed for a relative than the other two groups. The elderly were much less likely to receive gastric lavage or emesis and more likely to receive supportive treatment only than younger patients. This difference may, in part, be explained by the more frequent occurrence of benzodiazepine poisoning in those over 65 years.", 
    "79": "The benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms are presented here. The psychotic reactions to benzodiazepine withdrawal are seldom described in the literature. We report a case of acute manic-like reaction induced by sudden lorazepam withdrawal. The sudden release of catecholamines following abrupt cessation of short half-life benzodiazepine is suggested as underlying mechanism for such reaction.", 
    "80": "Rats were tested in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety after a probe injection of chlordiazepoxide (CDP 5 mg/kg) following short-term (5 days) or long-term (20 days) pretreatment with 5 or 20 mg/kg/day. After short-term pretreatment with either dose, the probe dose had anxiolytic effects (it increased the % number of entries, and % of time spent, on the open arms). After long-term pretreatment with either dose of CDP there was tolerance to these effects. When the rats were tested 24 hours after their last dose of CDP, there was no indication of spontaneous withdrawal responses in the rats from the short-term pretreatment groups, but the rats in the long-term pretreatment groups showed increased anxiety (decreases in the % number of entries, and the % of time spent, on the open arms, compared with controls). These results support suggestions that the development of tolerance and the incidence of withdrawal anxiety may both be manifestations of the underlying changes occurring during drug dependence.", 
    "81": "Recent reports of in vivo antagonism of the acute anti-conflict, ataxic, and lethal effects of ethanol with the partial inverse agonist imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513 implicate the GABAa/benzodiazepine receptor in mediating several acute effects of ethanol. These data raise the question as to whether all of the acute effects of ethanol can be antagonized by Ro15-4513. The present study addressed this issue by investigating the effect of Ro15-4513 on ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex and hypothermia in mice. We found that Ro15-4513 antagonized the hypnotic, but not the hypothermic, effects of ethanol when tested under identical conditions. These results suggest that the GABAa/benzodiazepine receptor may not be involved in mediating all pharmacological effects of ethanol.", 
    "82": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) content was measured, and the effect of GABA on acid secretion was studied using the everted preparation of isolated guinea pig stomachs. GABA contents in the mucosa layer and the remaining layer were 20-24 nmol/g tissue and 34-42 nmol/g tissue, respectively. GABA at 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-5) M induced acid secretion, and the maximum secretion was obtained at 3 X 10(-5) M, that is approximately 1.6-fold of the spontaneous secretion and approximately half of the amount secreted by histamine at 3 X 10(-4) M. The GABA-induced acid secretion was inhibited by bicuculline, scopolamine, pirenzepine, proglumide, and tetrodotoxin, but not by cimetidine. Muscimol (3 X 10 to 10(-5) M), but not baclofen, induced acid secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. The responses to GABA and muscimol were antagonized by bicuculline. Scopolamine and tetrodotoxin completely inhibited the acid secretion induced by low concentrations of GABA and muscimol and to some extent the response induced by high concentrations of muscimol. All these results indicate that GABA induces acid secretion via the A type of GABA receptor, probably located mainly on the cholinergic neurons and partially on the nonneuronal cells in the guinea pig stomach.", 
    "83": "I have described five elderly patients who had a syndrome characterized by reversible delirium, automatic movement, and anterograde amnesia after ingesting triazolam as a hypnotic. These cases raise concern about the use of short-acting, rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics in the elderly."
