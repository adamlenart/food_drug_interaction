All patients were anesthetized with fentanyl and N2O; arterial pCO2 and pO2 were maintained within the normal range by controlled ventilation. Midazolam produced minimal effects on the general circulation. Cerebral blood-flow decreased about 11% while cerebral oxygen consumption essentially remained unchanged. Cerebral perfusion pressure slightly decreased due to a reduction in mean aortic pressure. In three patients with elevated intracranial pressure midazolam decreased intracranial pressure significantly while there was no change in the other patients. It is concluded that midazolam is of no harm in patients with intracranial aneurysms. Furthermore this rapidly acting drug in addition to other measures might be of some benefit in patients with elevated intracranial pressure when immediate reduction of cerebral blood volume is desired.", 
    "1": "A new technique has been developed to quantify objectively certain characteristics of saccadic eye movements which can be used as indices of the effect of centrally-acting compounds. During a three minute test session subjects sit with their heads in a fixed position and are asked to follow horizontal step displacements of a spot on a CRT screen, driven by signals previously recorded on FM analogue tape. Displacements of the spot are produced at random intervals which result in saccadic eye movements having amplitudes 10 degrees to 40 degrees. The corneo-retinal potentials are d.c. amplified and stored on the same on the same tape, later sampled at 256 Hz, filtered, differentiated and compared to the spot-displacement signal. Reaction time, duration, peak velocity, post saccadic interval and saccadic accuracy are then determined. Efficient use of computer resources has been achieved with improvements in control of experimental conditions, in reliability and in accuracy of measurements. Automatic unbiased rejection of erroneous data has been achieved. The efficiency of the technique has made extensive clinical trials possible in an environment where computer power is not devoted to eye movement-measurements. In confirmation of previous work the peak velocity characteristic has been identified as a sensitive measure of the effect of several benzodiazepines.", 
    "2": "An endoscopic manometric technique was applied to the study of intraductal biliary and pancreatic pressures and sphincter activity in normal subjects. A perfused system using a modified endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography catheter was tested and found to provide reliable ductal and phasic recordings. Twenty-five healthy volunteers, aged 19-37, underwent endoscopic manometry under diazepam sedation. Distinct zones of high-pressure phasic activity were identified on pull-through from the pancreatic duct and common bile duct at mean distances of 4.5 and 5.0 mm, respectively, from the papillary orifice with frequencies of 7.0 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- SD) and 5.6 +/- 2.4 waves/min, respectively. These were considered to represent separate pancreatic duct and bile duct sphincters. Peak pancreatic duct sphincter pressure (47.6 +/- 8.2 mm Hg) and bile duct sphincter pressure (57.2 +/- 10.7 mm Hg) were similar. Pancreatic duct pressure was 11.4 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and common bile duct pressure was 3.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg. Values were adjusted to duodenal pressure as zero reference. The ductal and sphincteric pressures reported in this study provide a basis for the assessment of physiological, pharmacological, pathophysiological, and surgical effects on this area.", 
    "3": "Fifty-seven cases of meprobamate ingestion from 1974 through 1979 were reviewed. Serum meprobamate concentrations, clinical findings, and epidemiologic data were studied to determine the present status of the abuse of this compound. The average patient was a 37-year-old woman who ingested meprobamate and at least one other drug (usually a benzodiazepine, a barbiturate, ethanol, or an opiate) in a suicide attempt of gesture. She arrived at the hospital either alert or lethargic with equal frequency. Half of the time she was seen only in the emergency room, and half of the time she was hospitalized. She was usually treated with supportive care alone and survived the ingestion. Serum meprobamate concentrations exceeding 12 mg/dl were consistent with coma. Dysarthria, hypotension, tachycardia, and ataxia were the most common physical findings. Meprobamate addiction was present in six patients.", 
    "4": "Sodium iothalamate was injected intravenously into mice to test the hypothesis that reactions to contrast media are controlled by the central nervous system. Particular emphasis was placed on (a) the effect of the limbic portion of the brain on the hypothalamus and (b) the outflow through the autonomic nervous system. Diazepam and hexamethonium significantly affected the LD50; in addition, in comparison trials with control mice, they markedly decreased the death rate (p < 0.0005). High doses of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, given every 6 hours before the contrast medium, had no effect.", 
    "5": "Changes in the circulation parameters measured during modified neuroleptanalgesia were assessed for 75 cases. No significant deviation from the initial values were observed in the systolic blood pressure and pulse rate in the introductory phase of anesthesia introduced with Etomidate after Droperidol + diazepam premedication and maintained with Fentanyl, relaxation and the inhalation of nitrous oxide. Because of this marked stability of the circulation, the method is considered particularly advantageous for the analgesia of high-risk-patients.", 
    "6": "In a prospective study over 6 months involving 54 psychiatric outpatients with neurotic disorders, the habits of diazepam or placebo intake and the attitudes towards psychotherapy and the medication were studied. The patients, divided into two groups, received in a double-blind setting either diazepam or placebo. They were also seen for psychotherapy every 14 days. The patients were advised to use the medication according to their personal needs but not to take more than 6 tablets of 6 mg diazepam (or placebo) daily. All patients showed controlled use of the drug. No dependency was observed. The patients stopped taking the medication gradually in each group, but faster in the placebo group. 18% of the placebo group and 52% of the diazepam group were 'high' consumers (more than 200 tablets within a period of at least 20 weeks). The intake of the drug was mainly dictated by the symptoms. A second important factor modifying the intake habits was the fear of possible adverse effects of the medication. At the end of the treatment period the attitude towards psychotherapy was more favorable than that towards psychopharmacotherapy irrespective of the drug taken. Long-term intake of diazepam did not lead to a decrease in the motivation of working through the existing problems. In contrast, the diazepam group felt less than the placebo group that medication could be a long-term solution for personal or social problems.", 
    "7": "Three cases of verapamil intoxication are described. The first two patients took 6.4 g verapamil each and the third one took 0.8 g of verapamil and alcohol. All three developed a third-degree atrioventricular dissociation, the first patient developed a slow idioventricular rhythm without atrial activity, the second a temporary asystole. All were hypotensive, had anuria and shock, the first two were unconscious for several hours. The first one was treated with artificial cardiac pacing, orciprenaline and calcium gluconate, the second with cardiac pacing and orciprenaline. The third patient received fluids and a dopamine infusion. In the first case sinus rhythm returned 31 h after the swallowing of tablets, in the second after 32 hr and in the third after 10 h. Pacing with intensive monitoring and care seemed to be the most beneficial treatments in these cases.", 
    "8": "Computerised axial tomography requires total immobility, which must be obtained by a simple and safe technique of anaesthesia. Three anaesthesia techniques were used and analysed in 54 children aged less than 5 years: the technique of the feeding bottle, sedation with pentobarbital or diazepam and general anaesthesia with ketamine hydrochloride. The technique of the feeding bottle can be proposed in selected patients. Sedation can be also used but judiciously, not to deep. The systematic use of an depression immobilizing mattress with these two techniques gives better results. Intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride, when not contrindicate (intracranial hypertension or acute hydrocephaly), has been used always successfully.", 
    "9": "The authors relate their experience of 61 rectal anesthesias with ketamine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.25-0.5 mg/kg). Rectal anesthesia is well accepted by children who are afraid of percutaneous injection. When ketamine is used alone, they obtained only 76 p. cent good result. When diazepam is associated, good results arise to 95 p. cent. Diazepam added to ketamine allows surface surgery during 10 to 15 minutes.", 
    "10": "The biliary excretion of diazepam metabolites was found in rats. Equivalent dosages of diazepam were administered orally and intraperitoneally. The biliary excretion was dose-dependent and was greater following intraperitoneal administration. After intravenous administration, a greater percentage of the diazepam dosage administered was excreted into the bile. Repetitive intravenous administrations yielded results which approached those observed after intraperitoneally administered dosages given as a bolus.", 
    "11": "A test with dexamethasone was performed in 52 patients with endogenous depression, 35 chronic alcoholics, and 85 healthy individuals. In the patients with the depression the test was pathological (inhibition in 19%), and in chronic alcoholics abnormal but to a lesser degree (44%). In the healthy subjects the inhibition was 64%. In periods of remissions the test was normal in all the persons examined. A treatment with tryptophan, DOPA and phenazepam increased the degree of the inhibition. On the basis of these findings, as well as proceeding from literary data it was supposed that the disturbance of the inhibition of corticosteroid secretion by dexamethasone was due to a deficit of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, since serotonin directly stimulates the secretion of the corticotropin-releasing factor, but at the same time intensifies the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on its secretion. These results, as well as the literary data of the existence of a genetic connection between endogenous depression and chronic alcoholism in a number of cases give one grounds to assume that in patients with endogenous depression and in a part of chronic alcoholics the predisposition to the disease is associated with some common, hereditarily-determined defects of the metabolism of biogenic amines in the brain.", 
    "12": "Drug concentrations were measured in whole blood obtained from mother and child after induction of general anaesthesia with thiopental or diazepam and delivery by Caesarean section. In 27 cases given thiopental 3 mg/kg intravenously the 5-min child/mother concentration ratio rose with increasing injection-delivery (I-D) interval up to 8-10 min. The concentration in the newborn at 2 h showed a similar trend. In 30 cases given diazepam 0.3 mg/kg for sleep induction, there were some low values in cases delivered within 4 min after the injection. However, higher neonatal concentrations and child/mother ratios were observed when the operation lasted 4-5 min, and there was no further increase in cases with longer I-D intervals. There is evidence to suggest that net transfer to the fetus proceeds at a slower rate with thiopental than with diazepam. However, in the present series of low risk elective Caesarean sections, there was no appreciable difference between the induction agents with regard to their effect on the newborn infant.", 
    "13": "27 male volunteers aged 20 to 91 years, and 13 female volunteers aged 21 to 33 years, received single 5 to 10 mg doses of diazepam intravenously. Diazepam pharmacokinetics were determined from concentrations measured in multiple plasma samples drawn during 7 days after each dose. Diazepam elimination half-life among males (mean: 66 h) increased significantly with age (r = 0.53, p less than 0.005). Volume of distribution (mean: 1.39 liters/kg) also increased significantly with age (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001). Clearance of total diazepam in males (mean: 0.42 ml/min/kg) tended to decline with age (r = 0.32), but the association was of borderline significance (p = 0.1). Diazepam was extensively bound to plasma protein, with a mean free fraction among male subjects of 1.34%. Free fraction tended to increase with age (r = 0.14). Correction of volume of distribution and clearance for individual differences in binding did not alter the conclusions. Compared to young males, young females had larger volumes of distribution (1.87 vs. 1.34 liters/kg) and higher total clearance (0.63 vs. 0.49 ml/min/kg). These differences were even greater after correction for sex-related changes in protein binding. Elimination half-life did not differ between sexes. Since both age and sex can influence diazepam disposition, both should be considered as independent variables in studies of diazepam pharmacokinetics.", 
    "14": "Sixty-four women undergoing non-abdominal operations were anaesthetized with ketamine administered as a continuous intravenous drip combined or not with diazepam. This double-blind, randomised study assessed the effects of diazepam on the dosage, the cardio-vascular stimulation, and the psychotomimetic side-effects of ketamine. At the induction, ketamine was given in a dose of 2 mg/kg in combination with diazepam 10 mg or placebo i.v. followed by a continuous infusion of ketamine at variable rate. The amounts of ketamine necessary for anaesthesia was significantly reduced by diazepam, from 4.51 mg/kg to 3.55 mg/kg (p less than 0.001). The sympathomimetic effect of ketamine was significantly decreased by diazepam, as the increase in pulse rate as well as in blood pressure was less important (p less than 0.05). The frequency of hallucinations dropped from 30.0 p. cent to 2.9 p. cent with diazepam, while the total frequency of psychotomimetic side-effects fell from 36.6 p. cent to 11.8 p. cent (p less than 0.05). Although the frequency of psychotomimetic side-effects is still high with this method, it may be recommended to use a continuous drip of ketamine administration for anaesthesia of hypovolaemic and other poor risk patients.", 
    "15": "Urine specimens from methadone treatment clinics were screened for various abused drugs between 1974-1979 by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and immunoassay techniques (IAT). A comparison of the relative incidence of drugs abused reveals that IAT are more sensitive and detect far greater number of subjects abusing drugs than TLC. The results also show a significant abuse of heroin and cocaine during the period studied and a variation of the incidence of other drugs used during the same period. While these patients did not receive benzodiazepenes and tricyclic antidepressants by prescription, their abuse alone and in combination with each other was also found to be widespread. Low levels of PCP and/or its analogs were found in 1978 and 1979. The frequent finding of low levels of PCP in combination with other drugs indicates the availability of this hallucinogen and point to its use in combination with other illicit drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and heroin. The suggestion is made that more sensitive analytical methods for drugs screening be utilized in methadone monitoring programs, and that other classes of drugs be added than are currently required.", 
    "16": "In 47 adult patients undergoing either microlaryngoscopy or bronchoscopy, anesthesia was maintained with a continuous etomidate infusion after induction with etomidate and spraying the vocal cords and trachea with 10% xylocaine. The patients breathed air spontaneously throughout the procedure, oxygen being added if necessary. It is claimed that this technique provides good, safe and convenient anesthesia. An additional advantage in cases of microlaryngoscopy is that mobility of the vocal cord is retained.", 
    "17": "The effect of three premedications on induction, maintenance and recovery characteristics of minaxolone as a supplement to nitrous oxide and oxygen anesthesia were studied in 70 patients. Morphine and atropine premedication provided superior operative conditions with fewer side-effects when compared with atropine alone or diazepam and atropine. Recovery was significantly longer after minaxolone compared with a similar group of patients given Althesin. The ventilatory responses to the induction of anesthesia with minaxolone were measured in 25 patients. All patients showed an increase in respiratory frequency and a decrease in tidal volume. This effect was most marked in the group premedicated with diazepam and atropine.", 
    "18": "The effect of anticonvulsants and tranquilizers on the initiation and spreading of convulsive discharges in rats, as well as on the spontaneous pacemaker activity and the effects of orthodromal stimulation in mollusc neurons are studied. It was found that the anticonvulsants acted mainly on the initiation of the epileptic discharge due to their influence on the mechanisms of endoneuronal rhythms. Diphenin inhibited simultaneously the initiation and the spreading of the convulsive discharge, the spontaneous activity of the neurons, and the responses to orthodromal stimulation. The tranquilizers and suxilep were found to influence only the spreading of the epileptic activity; the tranquilizers did not block the neuronal pacemaker activity and corasol-induced discharges. The authors recommend using the data obtained for choosing antiepileptic combinations in clinical conditions.", 
    "19": "The effects of intra dorsalis raphe microinjections of chlordiazepoxide, GABA and 5-HT were studied on a model of behavioral suppression in rats. The suppression of responding for food was elicited by a 10 min presentation of a signal previously associated with the delivery of electric foot shocks. Microinjections of chlordiazepoxide, GABA and 5-HT (0.2 microliters) performed in awake hand-held rats reduced the behavioral suppression. Chlordiazepoxide and 5-HT acted in a synergistic way, while such a synergy could not be obtained when chlordiazepoxide and GABA were coadministered. Moreover, the effects of intra-raphe chloridazepoxide no longer appeared in rats given intra dorsalis raphe 5-7 dihydroxytryptamine (3 micrograms in 0.4 microliters) 3 weeks before testing. All these results further support the hypothesis of the involvement of 5-HT neurons both in punishment-induced inhibition and in the antipunishment activity of benzodiazepines. No evidence was obtained suggesting a GABAergic mediation for the functional interaction of chlordiazepoxide with 5-HT neurons in this experimental model. Since high 3H-flunitrazepam binding was found at the raphe dorsalis level, and since a 30% decrease in the number of intra-raphe 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites was detected after intra-raphe 5-7 dihydroxytryptamine, it is possible that intra-raphe chlordiazepoxide controls 5-HT neurons partly through some benzodiazepine binding sites located on 5-HT cells.", 
    "20": "A novel, solid-phase radioimmunoassay for morphine and related opiates is described in which radiolabelled morphine, antiserum and polyethylene glycol are premixed before being added to the samples or standards. The mixture can be stored at 2 degrees C and used for several months until decay of the 125I label leads to excessively long counting times. The method was developed using the Roche Abuscreen radioimmunoassay for morphine and has the particular advantages of simplicity (only 2 pipetting steps required instead of 5) and economy (800 assay tubes can be prepared from a 100-tube Abuscreen plus a 50% saving in operator time). The procedure can be applied to other assays providing the polyethylene glycol-precipitated antiserum is stable and that the antibody affinity for the labelled compound is not so high as to prevent displacement of the labelled compound from the antibody binding sites by unlabelled drug.", 
    "21": "A case report of psychomotor status was presented. A 51-year-old male caught a cold and had a high fever at the end of September, 1979. On October 7th, he had a visual hallucination followed by a generalized seizure. After hospitalization he went through several fits of automatism. On October 15th, he was seized with automatism status in which the seizures were repeated every 25 minutes and there was no recovery of consciousness between the seizures. Although an intravenous injection of diazepam interrupted this status, on October 17th he showed subclinical seizure status on the EEG during which automatism traces were rarely found. By the medication of carbamazepine and clonazepam, he improved gradually. CT-scan revealed the disappearance of the right sylvian fissure and CSF showed findings of viral encephalitis. Consequently, he was considered to have been suffering from temporal lobe encephalitis and shown an episode of psychomotor status with automatisms and automatism traces during which typical automatism status was observed as well.", 
    "22": "As people grow older, side effects due to the modification of pharmacokinetics are the main disadvantage in the use of psychotropic drugs in geriatrics. First, some general rules of prescription must be respected. One will indirectly influence sleep by modifying habits and, if medication becomes necessary, will give preference to chloral hydrate, then to the benzodiazepine byproducts, and, last, to some sedative neuroleptics. Anxiety should be treated mainly with benzodiazepines, taking great care as to the doses. Regarding depression, all the tricyclics and tetracyclics can be used, not forgetting the atropinic effects they have. In case of glaucoma, some substances are free from side effects. In spite of age, resort to lithium is possible with all cautions needed. Neuroleptics will get their best use in confused or delirious states: their main side effects are of extrapyramidal nature.", 
    "23": "The binding of methylene blue (MB) and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) to rabbit plasma was determined by ultrafiltration. The fractions (f) unbound of these two drugs to the plasma were about 23--29 ad 6--12%, respectively. These fvalues were comparable to binding data of these two drugs to bovine serum albumin. The results supported the previous suggestion stating that protein binding would partly account for relatively high value of apparent volume of distribution (Vd') for MB. Therefore, in order to investigate the distributive profile for MB as compared with that for CDP, pharmacokinetic parameters for MB and CDP were estimated from plasma concentration--time data following simultaneous intravenous administration by a bolus injection and by a contrast rate infusion in rabbits. The Vd' for MB was found to be dependent of dose in contrast with that for CDP by the infusion experiments at three different doses. These evidences assume that MB would be bound to and/or adsorbed on some biological components other than plasma protein.", 
    "24": "Cocaine (10 mg/kg), amphetamine (1 mg/kg), diacetylmorphine (5 mg/kg), pentobarbital (3 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg) caused in rats an activation of the reactions of electrical self-stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus, comparable by their pronouncement. All the drugs changed the pattern of histograms of durations distribution of pauses between self-stimulations, due primarily to a diminished number of long pauses. Psychodepressant drugs increased the number of long and superlong pedal pressings. A number of pairs of parameters with stable correlations was revealed, and their changes under the drugs effect were noted. The results of the study suggest that euphorigenic effect of the drugs is connected with the activation of reward system produced by them.", 
    "25": "A single 5-mg oral dose of diazepam was administered to 6 healthy volunteers on 3 occasions in a randomized 3-way crossover study. Modes of administration were: (A) (control): diazepam with 120 ml of water, preceded 30 min before with 120 ml of water; (B) diazepam with 120 ml water, preceded by 120 ml of a 50:50 vodka:water mixture, and (C) diazepam with 120 ml of the vodka mixture, preceded by 120 ml of water. Peak plasma diazepam levels averaged 166, 140 and 145 ng/ml in trials A, B and C, respectively; the time of peak concentration was 0.71, 2.1 and 1.5 h after the dose, respectively. Differences were not significant. Total areas under the plasma concentration curve were nearly identical (2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 micrograms/ml X h) among the 3 trials, as were values of diazepam elimination half-life (29, 36 and 35 h). The rate and extent of desmethyldiazepam formation also did not differ among trials. Thus, coadministration of diazepam with or shortly after a typical social cocktail tends to slow the rate of diazepam absorption, but does not influence the completeness of absorption or the rate of elimination.", 
    "26": "The tranquilizers Diazepam and Lonetyl were examined on rats for their influence on the higher nervous system, using the method of \"double escape\". Pharmacologic analysis of their action on dopaminergic structures in the central nervous system was performed as well. In this analysis they used dopamine agonist Apomorphine and dopamine antagonist Haloperidol. The authors established that diazepam is small doses did not inhibit dopaminergic system and its activation affected favourably its action, improving conditioned reflex activity. Inhibition of dopaminergic activity by Haloperidol reduced the effect of Diazepam. Lonetil, in contrast to diazepam, inhibited dopaminergic mediation and its sedative effect was increased considerably by Haloperidol.", 
    "27": "The present report considers goal directed human saccadic eye movements. It addresses the question how a given perceived target excentricity is transformed into the innervation pattern that creates the saccade to the target. More specifically, it investigates whether this pattern is an appropriately selected preprogram or whether it is continuously controlled by a local feedback loop that compares a non-visual eye position signal to the perceived target excentricity (a visual signal would be too slow). To this end, the relation between the accuracy of saccades aimed at a given target and their velocity and duration was examined. Duration and velocity were found to vary by as much as 60% while the amplitude showed no related variation and had an almost constant accuracy of about 90%. By administrating diazepam, the variabiity of saccade duration and velocity could be further increased, but still the amplitude remained almost constant. These results favour the hypothesis that saccadic innervation is controlled by a local feedback loop.", 
    "28": "The adsorption of diazepam on magnesium trisilicate, magnesium oxide, aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, bismuth oxycarbonate bismuth subsalicylate, talc, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, kaolin and charcoal was studied at 37 degrees C. With the exception of charcoal, magnesium trisilicate exhibited the highest adsorptive capacity for the drug. Talc and dibasic calcium phosphate had the lowest adsorptive power while the other materials tested had intermediate adsorption properties. In general, low elution values were obtained with both acidic and alkaline solutions. The presence of a specific interaction between diazepam and surface sites of the adsorbing materials was suggested. The Langmuir relationship was obeyed in case of bismuth oxycarbonate. The dissolution of the drug in absence and presence of magnesium trisilicate, which had a very high retention ability, was also studied. The antacid decreased obviously the dissolution of the tranquilizer. The implication of diazepam interaction with antacids and excipients on its bioavailability is to be further confirmed by in vivo testing.", 
    "29": "Difficulties are discussed that have occurred in the medicamentous treatment of chronic patients with a so-called schizophrenic defect. The main problem was that in case of a greater drive-increasing effect component of the drug (in the concrete case \"Defecton\") a recrudescence of productive-schizophrenic symptoms may occur in connection with the increase in drive. The authors' own opinion (Lange) with respect to a treatening \"defect\", psychopathological radical of the chronic schizophrenic residual condition (\"defect\"), personality-dependent syndrome structure with secondary symptoms, iaterogenisation and institutiogenisation of the \"defect\" (\"institution artefact\") is discussed.", 
    "30": "Reaction of anthramycin 11-methyl ether (AME) with trifluoroacetic acid results in formation of (1,11a)-didehydroanhydroanthramycin (DAA). Anthramycin biosynthetically labelled from DL-[3'RS(3'-3H)]; DL-[3'S(3'-3H)] and DL-[3'R(3'-3H)] tyrosine each lose approximately 50% of their tritium during this conversion to DAA confirming the labelling pattern of 3'-tritiated species of tyrosine in AME. As expected negligible losses of tritium occurred from AME biosynthetically labelled fron L-[2- or 6-3H] or L-[3- or 5-3H]tyrosine. DAA did not form a stable adduct with DNA in accord with the postulated mechanism of action of anthramycin.", 
    "31": "Hypotensive and orthostatic activities of a variety of orally administered antihypertensive drugs were concurrently evaluated in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats and attempts were made to relate these responses to effects on peripheral sympathetic function. The alpha-adrenergic blockers phentolamine and prazosin and the adrenergic neuron blocker guanethidine inhibited compensatory responses to upright tilt at antihypertensive doses. The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine produced milder inhibition. The centrally active agents methyldopa and clonidine and the vasodilator minoxidil did not alter tilt responses appreciably. In contrast, the vasodilator hydralazine exerted marked postural effects. Autonomic interactions were evaluated in pithed rats. alpha-Adrenergic receptor, adrenergic neuron and ganglionic blockers inhibited pressor responses to i.v. phenylephrine and/or to sympathetic nerve activation. Vasodilators did not produce specific effects. The tilt and pithed rat models, when used in conjunction, are very useful in predicting orthostatic potential of drugs in humans although absolute correlation cannot be expected.", 
    "32": "A double-blind investigation was performed on 113 adult females, hospitalized for short gynaecological procedures, in order to establish the suitability of methohexitone for short procedures and whether or not the quality of methohexitone anaesthesia could be improved with a diazepam supplement. All patients were anaesthetized with methohexitone (2.0 mg/kg): 57 of the patients received a 10 mg diazepam intravenous supplement and 56 received intravenous placebo (solvent of diazepam only). Diazepam injected after induction with methohexitone clearly improved the quality of methohexitone anaesthesia (p less than 0.1 more than 0.05) and reduced the need for supplementary doses of methohexitone (p less than 0.1 more than 0.05). The incidences of both nausea and vomiting were minimized (p less than 0.01 more than 0.001). Patient acceptance was equally good in both groups. It is commented that patients may seem fully awake and oriented, notwithstanding the fact that the body still contains significant amounts of the anaesthetic agent. Ambulatory patients should never be allowed to leave the hospital unescorted, as they recover their 'street-orientation' only after 12 to 24 hours. Furthermore, the patients or their escorts should be given definite and written instructions to avoid absolutely the use of alcohol or hypnotics which could, even in small amounts, potentiate the effect of methohexitone still in the body, for at least 12 hours. It is recommended that patients should avoid driving a motor vehicle or using dangerous tools or machines for 12 to 24 hours following recovery from methohexitone anaesthesia.", 
    "33": "A total of 1600 patients suffering from depression and anxiety was treated in one consultant practice over an 8-year period. In most cases, the depressive component was treated by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, but oxazepam was used as the anxiolytic in all cases in the series. Patients were encouraged to regulate their own dosage of oxazepam, and no difficulties occurred with this technique. The results showed the overall effectiveness of oxazepam as an anxiolytic to be better than 87% in those cases where depression co-existed.", 
    "34": "A method has been suggested for simultaneous recording of the content of 12C-phenazepam and its metabolites in the mouse brain and of minimum effective doses of corasole intravenously that induce the tonic extension of the animals. Parameters of the two-compartmental kinetic model of absorption, distribution and elimination of 14C-products in the mouse brain were determined. These processes conform to the first order kinetics. A correlation was disclosed between the content of radioactive products in the animals' brain and minimum effective doses of corasole. A linear decline of the anticonvulsant action of phenazepam was revealed during the experimental period. Radiochromatography enabled one to detect the parent compound and its 3-hydroxy metabolite in mouse brain extracts.", 
    "35": "Diazepam has the characteristics of a tumour promoter in a number of in vitro systems. The effect is apparent at concentrations of diazepam which are clinically relevant. Diazepam also accelerated tumour growth in two different experimental animal cancers. Tranquillizer use was found to be greater in women with metastatic breast cancer at the time of diagnosis than in those without metastases. Further evaluation of the possible effects of diazepam and related drugs on human and animal cancers is urgently required.", 
    "36": "The effect on intraocular pressure of induction of anesthesia with 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazol[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) as maleate or 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-(2H)-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (diazepam) has not previously been reported. We induced anesthesia in 30 patients, free of ophthalmologic disease and in good general health, with either midazolam maleate, diazepam or 5-ethyl-5-(1-methylbutyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid (thiopental). Ten patients were treated with each agent for induction. Intraocular pressure was measured with a hand-held Perkins applanation tonometer before induction, 1 and 3 min after induction, 1 min after succinylcholine, 1 mg/kg, and 1 min after tracheal intubation. A significant (p less than 0.001) decrease in intraocular pressure occurred after each induction agent both 1 and 3 min after induction. Also, after each agent, a significant rise in intraocular pressure compared with control occurred after succinylcholine and tracheal intubation. We conclude that midazolam maleate and diazepam reduce intraocular pressure to the same degree as thiopental and would be safe for procedures in which a fall in intraocular pressure is desirable; however, none of these drugs will protect against the rise in intraocular pressure seen following the administration of succinylcholine or tracheal intubation during a rapid sequence induction of general anesthesia.", 
    "37": "This study summarizes our results with various ataralgesic combinations and their effects on circulation and respiration. Together with the new water-soluble 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum), 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-(2H)1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (diazepam) and 5-(o-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-7-nitro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (flunitrazepam) are also considered, for the purpose of comparison. Pharmacokinetic studies confirm the clearly shorter duration of action of midazolam. The poor respiratory depressant action of the benzodiazepines can be easily and rapidly increased by premedication, ataralgesic combinations and substances for the prolongation of anaesthesia. Adequate spontaneous respiration is possible only in exceptional cases. The threshold doses for 100% suppression of cardiac stimulation due to 2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-methylaminocyclohexanone (ketamine) were determined for all three benzodiazepines. These doses are also valid for hypertension. The effect of intubation is not suppressed by the ataralgesic combination alone, whereas it does suppress the increase in pressure in the pulmonary circulation which is synchronous with the systemic blood pressure. The rise in intracranial pressure following ketamine alone is also prevented by premedication with benzodiazepines, which on the other hand offer no protection against certain other effects (hypoxia, hypercapnia, intubation), The same is true for increases in intraocular pressure. According to the results of investigations carried out, the new benzodiazepine midazolam justifies our hope for a substance with a similar basic effect, but with a clearly improved pharmacokinetic profile.", 
    "38": "In 43 patients electively scheduled for myocardial revascularization surgery, a hemodynamic comparison of 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) and 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-(2H)1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (diazepam) was made during cardiopulmonary bypass. Midazolam and diazepam were compared in patients with ischemic heart disease to determine the effects of the drugs on systemic vascular resistance at constant flow (cardiac output) and temperature. Diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) produced significantly greater decreases in perfusion pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and venous reservoir volume than did midazolam (0.2 mg/kg). It was concluded that there are subtle differences in the pharmacologic actions of both midazolam and diazepam. When used with constant flow on cardiopulmonary bypass, diazepam causes more pronounced arterial and venous dilation. These data are at variance with the findings in intact man.", 
    "39": "8-Chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazol[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam maleate, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) or thiopental were administered to 99 women undergoing short gynecological surgical procedures for induction and maintenance of anesthesia along with 67% nitrous oxide. Either fentanyl 1.5 microgram kg-1 or a saline placebo were given i.v. as acute premedication 5 min before induction. We measured the quality of induction and maintenance. Induction was more rapid after thiopental but thiopental produced more apnea especially when combined with fentanyl. Fentanyl premedication reduced the dose of hypnotics necessary to keep patients asleep. It was difficult to keep patients from moving during the procedure when only the hypnotics and nitrous oxide were used, so the use of these drugs for both induction and maintenance is recommended only when combined with narcotics or other analgesics. Although recovery after midazolam was slower than after thiopental, it was without untoward reactions such as hallucinations or excitement. Vomiting was less frequent after midazolam. Midazolam produced a profound period of amnesia for 1-2 h, so important instructions could not be given to patients during this time. All patients were awake enough to discharge from the hospital 200 min after the last dose of hypnotic was given. We would recommend a combination of midazolam, fentanyl and nitrous oxide for induction and maintenance of anesthesia for short surgical procedures except when a rapid induction is desired, then thiopental is preferred as the hypnotic.", 
    "40": "Diazepam is widely used as a sedative for loco-regional anesthesia. The venous irritation and long duration of action and hangover may be a drawback. We compared 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum), a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, with diazepam for cardio-respiratory changes, onset time, duration of action, amnesia and venous irritation after a single i.v. shot in loco-regional anesthesia.", 
    "41": "8-Chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) has a number of useful properties--including good tolerance on i.v. injection, and short duration of action--which make it a valuable substance in anesthesiology. The present study deals in particular with the general, coronary and cerebral hemodynamics. Observed hemodynamic effects lasted no more than 10 min, which renders midazolam a drug of good controllability.", 
    "42": "8-Chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) is a new benzodiazepine which, when compared with its predecessors diazepam (Valium) and flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), has several outstanding advantages: We conducted hemodynamic investigations with 0.15 mg/kg b.w. midazolam in a total of 28 coronary patients divided into 3 groups. The new water-soluble benzodiazepine is at the dose given useful in the induction of and as an adjuvant to anesthesia because of its hemodynamic effect.", 
    "43": "Our investigations have shown the following: 1. 8-Chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) produces no adverse haemodynamic changes in healthy subjects. 2. The reduction in peripheral resistance becomes apparent mainly in the case of raised baseline values, as, for example, in hypertensive subjects, but it can also be of significance prior to anaesthesia, when there may be raised systemic vascular resistance due to stress. 3. Venous pooling, which leads to a decrease in pre-load and subsequent lowering of the cardiac index, can have a compensatory effect in cardiac insufficiency. Under certain conditions, as for example, in the case of imminent volume deficit, a marked fall in pressure is to be expected. 4. The haemodynamic effects of midazolam are thus limited to vascular reactions. Under certain circumstances volume therapy may be necessary before the drug is used.", 
    "44": "After oral dosing of 10 mg 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) labelled with 14C (25 microCi) to 4 human volunteers, the total radioactivity is mainly excreted via the kidneys. Nearly 90% are excreted within 24 h. Main urinary metabolite is the conjugated 1-hydroxymethyl derivative, which amounts to 60-70% of the administered dose within 24 h. Compared to total radioactivity, levels of unchanged drug in plasma are rather low and differ from one subject to the next. Most of the plasma radioactivity consists of the 1-hydroxymethyl compound, most of it in conjugated form. Levels of free metabolite are lower than those of unchanged drug. Radioactivity is rapidly eliminated from plasma. The results of the present oral study seem to indicate significant first-pass metabolism.", 
    "45": "A HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) method for the determination of 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) and its hydroxy metabolites has been developed. The half-life of elimination of midazolam and the glucuronides of the metabolites 1-hydroxymethyl-midazolam, 4-hydroxy-midazolam and 1-hydroxymethyl-4-hydroxy-midazolam are identical, 53 min in dogs and 90 min in man.", 
    "46": "8-Chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4] benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) is a special type of benzodiazepine. Its salts are water-soluble and also stable in an aqueous solution. Following i.v. injection of the substance, the human body eliminates midazolam almost entirely by means of biotransformation. Following rapid i.v. injection of midazolam into 8 normal volunteers, the plasma concentration of the substance decreases to approximately 10% within 1 h owing to a rapid rate of distribution. The biological half-life in the terminal phase (beta) ranges between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 h. In view of the non-dose-dependent clearance and the various phases of distribution, the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug can be described by means of a linear three-compartmental model. The portion of drug extracted by the liver ranges between 40 and 50%, which implies a liver first-pass effect of approximately 50% after oral administration. The total plasma clearance is 300-350 ml/min. The absorption rate after i.m. injection is extremely rapid, with complete absorption taking place.", 
    "47": "In anesthetized dogs, (+)-(R)-alpha ((S)-1-[(3,3-di-3-thienylallyl)amino]-ethyl)-benzylalcohol hydrochloride (tinofedrine hydrochloride, D 8955) causes a remarkable increase of cardiac output by positive inotropic and chronotropic stimulation of the heart and simultaneous reduction of peripheral vascular resistance. The effect is antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. In comparison with typical beta-agonists (e.g., orciprenaline) tinofedrine at inotropically equieffective doses, has a much weaker effect on the heart rate. Measurement of tissue blood flow by radioactive tracer microspheres after tinofedrine exhibited a rather homogeneous increased perfusion in all parts of the brain, as well as myocardium, kidneys and liver. In coronary circulation tinofedrine causes vasodilation so that in a therapeutic dose range increased work load is equalized by a sufficient myocardial supply. Tinofedrine itself neither caused a disturbance of heart rhythm nor worsened aconitine-induced arrhythmias in anesthetized rats. Simultaneous application of digoxin or diazepam did not influence the action of tinofedrine; there was no evidence of any incompatibility of such combinations. Experiments with a possible metabolite (l-norephedrine) showed that it is not involved in the action of tinofedrine.", 
    "48": "Muscimol and diazepam reduced the number of avoidance responses of rats subjected to a conditioned avoidance situation. Diazepam, in a dose which per se did not influence the conditioned responses, significantly increased the disruption of avoidance behavior induced by muscimol. Bicuculline counteracted the avoidance impairment produced by muscimol, whereas it did not influence the disruption of avoidance performance induced by diazepam. Results are discussed with reference to the role of GABAergic system in the behavioral effects of muscimol and diazepam.", 
    "49": "The plasma level course and the elimination of oxazepam (Adumbran) via urine were investigated following multiple oral administration in volunteers and patients with chronic renal failure. Additionally, drug metabolizing enzyme systems had been induced in the volunteers by pretreatment with phenobarbital. The plasma protein binding in vitro of oxazepam was determined in volunteers and patients. The plasma levels and the renal elimination of oxazepam and its metabolites do not show any differences between the two groups of volunteers (oxazepam and oxazepam after pretreatment). 83--92% of the dosage are eliminated via urine. In comparison, the plasma levels of oxazepam in patients with renal failure are half those of the volunteers. However, the plasma levels of oxazepam metabolites in patients are much higher than in volunteers and these increases correlate to the creatinine clearance of the patients. The non-protein bound oxazepam in plasma was found to be twice as high in the plasma of patients as that of volunteers. As a consequence, the lower plasma level of oxazepam in patients will be compensated for so that the pharmacological activity in patients and volunteers due to free oxazepam in the plasma water is nearly the same. Therefore a new dosage regimen for treatment with oxazepam in patients with renal failure is not necessary.", 
    "50": "Phenazepam given to rats in a daily dose of 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally for a long (30 days) time ceased to produce the sedative effect, and discontinuation of the medication led to development of the so-called \"recoil syndrome\" characterized by general depression and disturbances of the conditioned-reflex activity. The \"recoil syndrome\" was distinguished for a selective specificity, since its motor and sensor manifestations were eliminated only by benzodiazepine derivatives (phenazepam, diazepam). Drugs from other chemical slasses (meprobamate, trioxazine, amipazin) did not influence this syndrome.", 
    "51": "Rats with lateral hypothalamic electrodes were treated with diazepam in doses of 10--20 mg/kd during 10 days. Part of the animals showed tolerance to the inhibitory effect of the drug. Within the drug administration period depression of the self-stimulation response was observed under 24-hour abstinence. After diazepam withdrawal two forms of abstinent changes were noted--inhibition and facilitation. The effects of diazepam were modulated by opiate receptors' blockade with naloxon.", 
    "52": "It has been shown in experiments on rats that a single administration of phenazepam in doses of 0.5 and 2 mg/kg reduces the period of falling asleep and of being conscious, shortens the duration of the paradoxical sleep phase and increases the duration of slow-wave sleep thereby indicating the intensity of the drug hypnotic effect. Prolonged (10 days) administration of phenazepam does not induce tolerance. However, after the drug discontinuation there develops a withdrawal syndrome that is characterised by changes in the sleep structure.", 
    "53": "Six aliphatic esters of oxazepam were investigated for 3H-diazepam displacing activity and hydrolysis in rat in the brain P2-fraction treated with diisopropylfluorophosphate. The esters are prodrugs in relation to oxazepam. Increasing size of the 3-substituent and steric hindrance increased the value of IC50. Controversial reports on oxazepam hemisuccinate could be explained by its stereoselective hydrolysis in vivo.", 
    "54": "Four proteolytic enzymes trypsin, protease type I, protease type V (Pronase AS) and protease type VIII (Subtilisin) were used for digestion of blood, brain, liver, and kidney in experimental poisonings of dogs with phenobarbital, amitriptyline, diazepam, and chlorpromazine. Enzymic digestion was used also in 21 forensic cases of fatal poisonings with hypnotic and psychotropic drugs. Each enzyme applied gave a similar yield. The efficienct of enzymic digestion varied according to the kind of drug, tissue, and individual. In general, enzymic hydrolysis proved useful in isolation of psychotropic drugs from liver and brain, being less effective in the case of blood. The mechanism of drugs liberation after enzymic treatment remains obscure.", 
    "55": "In a short-term clinical study, 60 insomniac outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either 30 mg of quazepam or placebo orally for five consecutive nights. All measures of sleep quazepam-treated patients had better sleep from the first night of treatment onward. Quazepam is a safe and effective hypnotic agent, and its efficacy is manifested on the first night of administration.", 
    "56": "To compare the incidence and severity of pain and myoclonus, 83 patients, premedicated with oral diazepam, received a double-blind intravenous injection of either droperidol 5 mg, fentanyl 0.1 mg or normal saline two minutes before induction with etomidate. The only statistically significant difference between the three groups was the decreased incidence of involuntary movements in the fentanyl and the droperidol group as compared with the normal saline group."
