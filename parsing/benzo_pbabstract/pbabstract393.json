    "0": "Differences in daytime sleepiness, lifestyle disruptions, and emotional distress were compared across nine groups taking sleep-promoting substances. Groups included individuals taking zopiclone (n = 274), amitriptyline (n = 107), lorazepam (n = 258), oxazepam (n= 141), diphenhydramine HCl (n = 99), triazolam(n = 137), long acting benzodiazepines (n = 120), temazepam (n = 176), and miscellaneous other medications (n = 286). Data were gathered by self-report, using standardized instruments in a mail-back questionnaire procedure. Respondents included the first 1,598 participants enrolled in a Canadian multicentre project, including six sites attached to academic psychiatric units. Results indicated that quality of life effects differed across groups in both daytime sleepiness and lifestyle disruptions (illness intrusiveness), but not in depressive symptoms. Daytime sleepiness was significantly higher among people taking diphenhydramine HCl as compared to temazepam, zopiclone, lorazepam, and oxazepam. Illness intrusiveness was significantly higher among patients taking amitriptyline as compared to those taking triazolam, oxazepam, long-acting benzodiazepines, and zopiclone. It may be useful to inform patients of differences in psychosocial outcomes when prescribing hypnotic medications.", 
    "1": "Withdrawal from hypnotics can produce a variety of problems, especially sleep difficulties, some of which may arise from the multiple actions of most hypnotics, thus producing a range of rebound effects. This study examined whether switching patients to a hypnotic with a narrower range of action and of a different class would reduce these problems. One hundred and thirty-four patients participated; they were randomly allocated to one of three methods of switching from \"previous hypnotic\" to zopiclone (a cyclopyrrolone). The methods were gap (an interval between taking the two drugs); abuttal (taking zopiclone immediately on stopping previous drug); and overlap (gradually reducing previous drug after starting zopiclone). The main findings were that zopiclone was associated with better sleep and increased alertness; the abuttal method was the best method of switching; and no serious side effects from zopiclone were reported. It was concluded that zopiclone has a useful role in benzodiazepine withdrawal, and that immediate substitution is the best method.", 
    "2": "The mechanism of action of the cyclopyrrolone hypnotic drug zopiclone involves allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor. Zopiclone displaces the binding of [(3)H]-flunitrazepam with an affinity of 28 nM, and enhances the binding of the channel blocker [(35)S]-TBPS. The binding of zopiclone, unlike that of hypnotic benzodiazepines, is not facilitated by GABA. Zopiclone does not distinguish between GABAA receptors containing different alpha-subunits (BZ(1) and BZ(2) phenotype). Studies with protein-modifying agents (eg diethylpyrocarbonate) and photoaffinity labelling suggest that cyclopyrrolones bind to a domain on the GABAA receptor different from the benzodiazepine binding domain. The consequence of this interaction with the GABAA receptor is to potentiate responses to GABA, as can be demonstrated by electrophysiological methods. Subchronic treatment of mice with high doses of zopiclone does not produce the changes in sensitivity of the GABAA receptor that are observed with hypnotic benzodiazepines.", 
    "3": "Increases in psychosocial stress and disruption of the biological clock due to irregular sleep-wake schedules as well as an increase in the elderly population have resulted in an increase in sleep disorders, most notably insomnia. In order to manage insomnia, correction of a poor sleep environment is of primary importance. We now have many good GABA A receptor agonists such as benzodiazepines and cyclopyrrolones (zopiclone) for use as hypnotics, but to achieve improvements in nocturnal sleep and restoration of daytime functions, short- or ultra-short acting hypnotics are recommended. Zopiclone has been reported to show weaker effects on sleep architecture than other benzodiazepines and does not exacerbate mild or moderate sleep apnea syndrome. Some patients are therapeutic-dose dependent on hypnotics or anxiolytics without showing detectable side effects. It may be possible for some insomniacs, particularly forelderly people, to use the minimum necessary dose of hypnotics to achieve good sleep and live a happy life from the standpoint of good quality of life.", 
    "4": "Akathisia, dystonia, dyskinesia and parkinsonism, the four main categories of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS), represent major disadvantages in antipsychotic therapy. In vulnerable patients, acute EPS may progress into potentially irreversible forms such as tardive dystonia and tardive dyskinesia. In the psychiatric clinic, these EPS are often insufficiently recognised or permitted to exist without treatment. In order to ensure a better EPS diagnosis, a simple examination procedure is described. EPS rating scales may serve as an aid in this process. Guidelines are given to prevent and treat EPS. Thus, EPS are best prevented by a course of neuroleptic medication involving as little antidopaminergic D(2) effect as possible, including the use of the lowest effective dose )sometimes obtained by addition of a benzodiazepine or carbamazepine) and with antipsychotic drugs which produce low D(2) receptor blockade. Treating EPS also consists of using the lowest effective dose and antipsychotics with a low D(2) dopamine receptor occupancy. At present, clozapine is the only drug that produces antipsychotic benefits at doses that cause far less D(2) receptor antagonism in the basal ganglia of the brain than that seen with standard neuroleptics; however, newer drugs, such as olanzepine, seroquel and sertindole, are on the way.", 
    "5": "Midazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine that has been used for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether midazolam used for this purpose would impair the antidepressive efficacy of ECT. In a double-blind random-assignment study midazolam was compared to methohexital on the antidepressive efficacy of bilateral ECT as measured by the reduction in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores and seizure duration. Sixteen DSM-III-R major depressive disorder patients with melancholia were included. Midazolam and methohexital did not differ in their effects on the MADRS score or seizure duration; no correlation was found between seizure duration and outcome of depression for either group. Our preliminary findings do not support the claim that benzodiazepines should not be used during bilateral ECT.", 
    "6": "Little consensus exists on the risk of benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence. We investigated how often BZD dependence and related concepts have been defined in the literature on BZD effects in humans. In addition, the definitions of BZD dependence were compared in order to assess the similarity of contents. From a total of 250 papers (published between 1988 and 1991) 51 provided 126 dependence-related definitions. Six studies referred to the DSM definitions and one to the WHO definition. The obsolete concept of addiction was frequently defined (n=13), with little consensus about its meaning. Psychological and physical dependence were defined fairly often (n=29), also with low levels of consensus. We conclude that the discussion on the risk of BZD dependence would be well-served by attempting to improve consensus first. This may lead to more meaningful data on the incidence, prevalence and relevant co-factors of BZD dependence. An outline for criteria for benzodiazepine dependence is presented.", 
    "7": "This is the study on the transition of the standards and test methods for barbiturates drugs (Bar-d) between JP IV (1920) and JP XII (1991). The results are as follows: Many new Bar-d appeared between JP VI (1951) and JP VIII (1971). Then many kinds of test methods for Bar-d were studied between JP VII (1961) and JP VIII (1971) and common and precise test methods were established. It is thought that Bar-d were used widely as hypnotics and sedatives in the 1960's in Japan, but some Bar-d were eliminated since JP IX (1976). The test methods for Bar-d were never revised after JP VIII (1971). It is thought that the first choice drugs for hypnotics and sedatives in Japan have transferred from Bromides and Bar-d to Benzodiazepines and the demand of Bar-d as hypnotics and sedatives has declined.", 
    "8": "Muscarinic receptors depress Ca2+ currents in superior cervical ganglion neurons by two signaling pathways. One is sensitive to pertussis toxin and acts rapidly by a membrane-delimited pathway on the channels. The other is not sensitive to pertussis toxin and acts more slowly through an unknown second messenger. These pathways are shared with several other agonists.", 
    "9": "Several novel methoctramine-related tetraamines were designed, and their biological profiles at muscarinic receptor subtypes were assessed by functional experiments in isolated guinea pig and rat atria (M2) and smooth muscle (ileum and trachea, M3) and by binding assays in rat cortex (M1), heart (M2), and submaxillary gland (M3) homogenates and NG 108-15 cells (M4). Tripitramine, a nonsymmetrical tetraamine, resulted in the most potent and the most selective muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist of the series (pA2 = 9.14-9.85; pKi = 9.54). Spirotramine (FC 15-94), a symmetrical tetraamine, was able to differentiate between muscarinic M1 receptors (pKi = 7.88) and the other subtypes (M2, pKi = 6.20; M3, pKi = 5.81; M4, pKi = 6.27). Thus, tripitramine and spirotramine could be valuable tools for the pharmacological classification and characterization of muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "10": "The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine and the tricyclic muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine and telenzepine have been derivatized using a functionalized congener approach for the purpose of synthesizing high affinity ligand probes that are suitable for conjugation with prosthetic groups, for receptor cross-linking, fluorescent and radioactive detection, etc. A novel fluorescent conjugate of TAC (telenzepine amine congener), an n-decylamino derivative of the m1-selective antagonist, with the fluorescent trisulfonated pyrene dye Cascade Blue may be useful for assaying the receptor as an alternative to radiotracers. In a rat m3 receptor mutant containing a single amino acid substitution in the sixth transmembrane domain (Asn507 to Ala) the parent telenzepine lost 636-fold in affinity, while TAC lost only 27-fold. Thus, the decylamino group of TAC stabilizes the bound state and thus enhances potency by acting as a distal anchor in the receptor binding site. We have built a computer-assisted molecular model of the transmembrane regions of muscarinic receptors based on homology with the G-protein coupled receptor rhodopsin, for which a low resolution structure is known. We have coordinated the antagonist pharmacophore (tricyclic and piperazine moieties) with residues of the third and seventh helices of the rat m3 receptor. Although the decylamino chain of TAC is likely to be highly flexible and may adopt many conformations, we located one possible site for a salt bridge formation with the positively charged -NH3+ group, i.e. Asp113 in helix II.", 
    "11": "The muscarinic pharmacology of C1-methyl-substituted chiral compounds related to McN-A-343 and of (R)- and (S)-dimethindene has been studied. Among the McN-A-343 analogues, the (S)-enantiomers were more potent and had higher affinity than the (R)-isomers. The quaternary compound (S)-BN 228 was found to be the most potent M1-selective agonist known today (pEC50: M1/rabbit vas deferens = 7.83; M2/guinea-pig atria = 6.35; M3/guinea-pig ileum = 6.29). In both the atria and ileum the tertiary carbamate, (S)-4-F-MePyMcN, was a competitive antagonist (pA2 value = 7.39 and 6.82, respectively). In contrast, in rabbit vas deferens (S)-4-F-MePyMcN was a potent partial agonist (pEC50 = 7.22; apparent efficacy = 0.83). These results indicate that (S)-4-F-MePyMcN might be a useful tool to study M1 receptor-mediated effects involved in central cholinergic function. (S)-Dimethindene was a potent M2-selective antagonist (pA2 = 7.86/atria; pKi = 7.8/rat heart) with lower affinities for the M1 (pA2 = 6.36/rat duodenum; pKi = 7.1/NB-OK 1 cells), M3 (pA2 = 6.92/guinea-pig ileum; pKi = 6.7/rat pancreas) and M4 receptors (pKi = 7.0/rat striatum). It was more potent (up to 41-fold) than the (R)-isomer. In contrast, the stereoselectivity was inverse at ileal H1 receptors (pA2: (R)-isomer = 9.42; (S)-isomer = 7.48). Thus, (S)-dimethindene could be a valuable agent to test the hypothesis that M2 antagonists show beneficial effects in the treatment of cognitive disorders. It might also become the starting point for the development of diagnostic tools for quantifying M2 receptors in the CNS with PET imaging.", 
    "12": "A case is described of Lyell syndrome in a female patient with schizoaffective psychosis which developed several days after addition of carbamazepine to the psychotropic treatment used. After withdrawal of the drug and three weeks of treatment with prednisone in dose 60 mg daily, antibiotic therapy and intensive dermatological-nursing care, full remission of skin lesions and oral mucosa lesions was obtained.",

They were observed and evaluated in period from April 5th, 1990 till December 31st, 1990. The group included 32 women and 16 men. The conclusion is the women was 66.6% and the men 33.4%. 23 persons (47.9%) was treated with Doxepin and 25 persons (52.1%) was treated with Alprazolam (Xanax, Valeans).

We used blood samples from inpatients with specific psychiatric symptoms. The medication consist of hypnotic nitrazepam and antidepressant trazodone, using film-coated tablets trazolon, 50 mg once a day, three weeks. In the second part of our experiment, we studied the antioxidant properties of trazodone, using blood samples from healthy subjects.

    "16": "In September 1994 a team of one doctor, two D.S.A.'s and two dentists went to Romania. Their mission was to provide dental treatment to mentally handicapped children at an orphanage in Gradinari, near Bucharest. The dental team were guests of Comber, a cross-border charity, and stayed in Bucharest, travelling to Gradinari every day. The equipment was sent out in advance and set up in a room at the orphanage. Initially, it was planned to provide treatment under general anaesthesia: however, due to logistical problems this was modified. A programme was set up using pre-operative sedation. This was followed up by wrapping the child in a blanket secured with a belt. With the child thus restrained, treatment was carried out using local anaesthesia. The sedation/restraint treatment was better adapted to some cases than general anaesthesia. A full clearance is described. Though the treatment of the children was slow and tedious, the team were very happy with the results. A future mission will take place.", 
    "17": "The effect of clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on intravenous (IV) sedation with midazolam was studied. Subjects were eight healthy adults; IV sedation was performed twice on each subject. In the control (CO) group, midazolam alone was administered. In the clonidine (CL) group, the subjects were given about 5 micrograms/kg of clonidine orally 2 hr before the initiation of sedation with midazolam. The following parameters were determined: dose of midazolam, changes in vital signs, recovery time, amnesia, and side effects. The average sedating dose of midazolam was 0.078 and 0.043 mg/kg in the CO and CL groups, respectively. Recovery times determined by stabilometry were 150 and 120 min in the CO and CL groups, respectively. Based on these results, the combined use of clonidine can reduce the dose of midazolam and shorten the recovery time. It is suggested that clonidine may be useful in IV sedation with midazolam.", 
    "18": "This study examined the effects of age on the behavior of mice administered one of two benzodiazepines with and without nitrous oxide. Young (3 wk +/- 3 days) and adolescent (7 wk +/- 3 days) male DBA-2 mice were administered oral diazepam (2.0 or 3.5 mg/kg), midazolam (0.75 or 1.2 mg/kg), or a placebo in combination with 50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen, or room air. The mouse staircase model was used, where the number of rears (NR) served as an index of anxiety, and the number of steps ascended (NSA) as an index of sedation. No significant differences in the responses between the ages were noted. Nitrous oxide seemed to increase the NR and NSA, whereas the benzodiazepines alone did not affect behavior. These DBA-2 mice may represent a strain that is less sensitive to the anxiolytic-sedative effects of the benzodiazepines than are other strains.", 
    "19": "These results were all obtained by dental anesthesiologists in our clinic actually conducting conscious sedation while observing the patients' response and appearance. Consequently, the anesthesiologist's preferences and skill seem to influence the drugs chosen and the method of use. In reviewing these 300 cases, we found many in which the procedure was completed within 40 min, and effective sedation could be achieved by intravenous sedation using a single benzodiazepine. When a variety of dental treatments are scheduled, tooth extraction is usually performed last. Since the depth of sedation in such cases has become shallow, carelessly performed local anesthetic injections lead to undesirable results. Aside from the nature and duration of treatment, when sedation was employed because of patients' problems, such as anxiety concerning the procedure, good sedation was often achieved with a benzodiazepine, even for relatively lengthy treatments. When a benzodiazepine failed to achieve good sedation on first administration in patients scheduled for repeated sedation, additional drugs are sometimes required from the second time onward. In patients with a gag reflex, conscious sedation with a benzodiazepine alone, and without a comprehensive sedation plan, often ends in failure, and ultimately high doses of multiple drugs have been used in some patients. In some cases, patient management was impossible without general anesthesia.", 
    "20": "The addition of a benzodiazepine antagonist to the dental anesthesiologist's armamentarium should provide added safety for conscious sedation using benzodiazepines. A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of flumazenil, the first available benzodiazepine antagonist, was performed to evaluate its safety and efficacy following conscious sedation induced by diazepam and fentanyl. Flumazenil was found to reverse rapidly much of the central nervous system depression induced by fentanyl and diazepam conscious sedation. Flumazenil appears to be a valuable adjunct for dentists who administer intravenous benzodiazepines for conscious sedation.", 
    "21": "A binding overshoot was frequently observed in the time course of association of diazepam with rat brain membrane receptors shortly after the start of the interaction. Such time profiles most likely reflect the \"receptor switch\" mechanism, assuming an equilibrium between two forms of a receptor (R and R*) that possess different affinities to the ligand (L) in question. Similar effects could be caused by the presence of a slowly dissociating competitor. The kinetics of these mechanisms were verified by simulation of theoretical time courses. A computer program for simulation of the time course, and estimation of rate constants of the individual reaction steps, was developed and is described in this communication. It employs the Euler-Cauchy integration for simulation of theoretical time courses. Optimised estimates of the rate constants were computed by simultaneous random variation of parameters within a pre-set interval. Stable solutions can be obtained for this system, thus enabling evaluation of equilibrium constants defined by the model. The source code is available in Turbo-Pascal. It can be used, after re-writing the rate equations, for fitting of similar kinetic models to suitable experimental data.", 
    "22": "The optic tectum of the salmon is a primary visual center with direct input from the retina via the optic tract. The structure is homologous with the superior colliculus of the mammalian brain. We have studied the distribution of immunoreactivity against the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor beta2/beta3 subunits with a monoclonal antibody (BD-17) in the optic tectum of the salmon brain. A weak immunoreactivity is found in the rostral stratum marginale (SM), strong labelling of the neuropil is shown in a thin band in stratum opticum (SO), two bands in stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale (SFGS) and two bands in stratum griseum centrale (SGC). Immunoreactive perikarya with neurites that extend radially through the stratum album centrale (SAC) are located in the stratum periventriculare. BD-17 immunoreactivity is to a great extent located in tectal layers that receive direct retinal input, i.e. the SO, SFGS and SGC. These layers are known to receive input also from other visual centers, such as the pretectum (SO, SFGS), the nucleus isthmi (SO, SFGS, SGC), as well as non-visual regions as the telencephalon (SGC). High levels of 2-[125I]-iodomelatonin binding sites have previously been demonstrated in all layers of the salmon optic tectum except the SM and SPV. Thus it appears likely that GABA and/or benzodiazepines and melatonin play a role in visual processing in the optic tectum of teleost fish.", 
    "23": "The pharmacology of native and recombinant GABA-A receptors containing either gamma1, gamma2 or gamma3 subunits has been investigated. The pharmacology of native receptors has been investigated by immunoprecipitating receptors from solubilised preparations of rat brain with antisera specific for individual gamma-subunits and analysing their radioligand binding characteristics. Receptors containing a gamma1-subunit do not bind benzodiazepine radioligands with high affinity. Those containing either a gamma2 or gamma3 subunit bind [3H]flumazenil with high affinity. Some compounds compete for these binding sites with multiple affinities, reflecting the presence of populations of receptors containing several different types of alpha-subunit. Photoaffinity-labelling of GABA-A receptors from a cell line stably expressing GABA-A receptors of composition alpha1beta3gamma2 followed by immunoprecipitation of individual subunits revealed that the alpha and gamma but not the beta-subunit could be irreversibly labelled by [3H]flunitrazepam. The properties of recombinant receptors have been investigated in oocytes expressing gamma1, gamma2, or gamma3 subunits in combination with an alpha and a beta-subunit. Some compounds such as zolpidem, DMCM and flunitrazepam show selectivity for receptors containing different gamma-subunits. Others such as CL 218,872 show no selectivity between receptors containing different gamma-subunits but exhibit selectivity for receptors containing different alpha-subunits. These data taken together suggest that the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor is formed with contributions from both the alpha and gamma-subunits.", 
    "24": "Most drugs used to treat myoclonus are also antiepileptic. The main drugs are the benzodiazepines, valproate, and barbituates. Advances in the understanding of antiepileptic drug mechanisms of action have revealed two main patterns: increasing inhibition either through GABA or glycine, or decreasing excitation due to glutamate. Anticonvulsants such as the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, vigabatrin, tiagabine, or progabide act through GABA. New prototype anticonvulsants such as dizocilpine and remacemide target glutamate receptors or associated ion channels. For some antimyoclonic drugs such as piracetam, many effects are reported but no mechanism of action has been established. Many newer anticonvulsants have not been tested in human myoclonic disorders but efficacy against PTZ-induced seizures suggests antimyoclonic activity. Our ability to improve the treatment of myoclonus requires greater knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of myoclonus and more exact delineation of its relation to epilepsy. Better drugs also will result from refinements from prototype drugs and new concepts about brain function. Most of the discussion has been focused on the use of drugs as symptomatic treatment, but drugs such as glutamate blockers are already having a role in the treatment of degenerative neurological disorders, an important cause of some myoclonic disorders. It also may be possible to improve treatment by focusing on selective regional effects of drugs or drug delivery. The CNS penetration of drugs is often no uniform. For many antimyoclonic and antiepileptic drugs, regional studies have not been performed, especially in humans. Lack of efficacy could therefore be due to lack of drug delivery to myoclonic generators or suppression structures. It is conceivable that drug effects in different brain regions also may be opposing, such as in forebrain and hindbrain structures. Stimulation of the same receptor subtype may have different implications for myoclonus if the sites are pre- or postsynaptically located (as in 5-HTIA sites), or predominantly cerebellar versus hippocampal (as in BDZ I vs II sites). Molecular genetic abnormalities in neurological disease may affect neurotransmission and the action of drug either directly at the receptor site or in other ways such as transduction, translation, or expression. Further insights into these abnormalities may provide new targets for pharmacotherapy. Most antiepileptic and antimyoclonic drugs developed to date have aimed at broad-spectrum treatment of the symptoms, rather than treatment of regional problems such as in the forebrain or the hindbrain. Because of this, the currently available drugs have broad side effects such as cognitive impairment, tremors, teratogenicity, etc. To develop more region-specific and more efficacious drugs, we need to develop a better understanding of local central nervous system problems in myoclonus and epilepsy. The development and application of molecular biological techniques have increased our knowledge of receptors and transporters immensely. It is conceivable that in the near future we will be able to determine whether small mutations affect the structure and function of these molecules. In addition, the glimpses into the process of cell death and sprouting by remaining neurons in the epileptic brain, and perhaps the myoclonic brain, raise the possibility of designing regionally oriented drugs with greater efficacy and fewer side effects. The current developments in the understanding of the central neurons should allow for the development of exciting new pharmacotherapies in the future.", 
    "25": "In a double-blind study of 102 patients with a mean age of 79 years, zopiclone was compared to flunitrazepam. The patients rated their sleep in a diary. There was no statistically significant difference between the relatively low dose of 5 mg zopiclone and 1 mg flunitrazepam for eleven out of the twelve variables measuring subjective sleep quality and quantity. There was no differences between the drugs as regards patients' feelings of being rested or alertness.",

    "28": "Seventy publications met inclusion criteria and reported on a total of 178 patients and included 270 separate treatment episodes. Most of the articles were case-reports, although a few case-series were identified. Multiple causes of catatonia were identified in these reports. The most commonly reported treatment for catatonia was with benzodiazepines which were effective in 70 percent of the cases, with lorazepam demonstrating the highest frequency of use and a 79 percent complete response rate. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was also efficacious (85%) and was more likely to provide a positive outcome in cases of malignant catatonia. Antipsychotics demonstrated poor efficacy.", 
    "29": "Catatonia is a nonspecific syndrome with multiple etiologies. Treatment of catatonia should be based on the underlying cause when it is identifiable. Lorazepam appears to offer a safe, effective first-line treatment of catatonia.

    "30": "By the results of bicycle ergometry test 28 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients were divided into 2 groups: with a pronounced anginal syndrome (group 1) and coronary insufficiency evident on ECG (group 2). Vegetative and psychophysiological parameters obtained in the examinees (heart rate, arterial pressure, pain threshold, personality profile) demonstrated that increased pain sensitivity, anxiety, predisposition to neurotic reactions were more typical for patients of group 1. Therapeutic response was achieved after psychophysiological correction by means of creation and activation of artificial stable functional connections of the brain.", 
    "31": "Chronological studies of the development of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor sites were undertaken with the goal of evaluating the sensitivity of this marker for the study of the gliosis development in the injured brain. No significant increase in [3H] PK-11195 binding occurred in the rat brain stab wound one day following the puncture. A significant increase in the receptor density (Bmax) from the second day onward was observed. The Bmax reached its highest levels in the grey matter on the sixth day after a 23-gauge needle wound (8.75 +/- 0.09; pmol mg-tissue-1) and on the seventh day after an 18-gauge needle wound (8.98 +/- 0.31 pmol mg-tissue-1). In the white matter, the Bmax was greatest seven days after the wound (3.42 +/- 0.07; pmol mg-tissue-1; 23-gauge needle and 3.56 +/- 0.1 pmol mg-tissue-1 in the 18-gauge needle injury). Between 30 and 60 days after the wound, the Bmax was significantly lower than the Bmax observed between 6 and 14 days. The Bmax in the wound produced with needles was seven to eight times greater than the Bmax in the grey matter of the ipsilateral and contralateral cortices. Histological examination showed that there were no astrocytes or macrophages in the stab wound one day after the lesion. However, the glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells and macrophages appeared on D3 after an injury. Gliosis, as measured by the PK-11195 binding, was also observed in the remote contralateral cortex. Data shows that PK-11195 binding is a very sensitive method of evaluating brain injury and could be of great value in studying progressive injuries in the living human brain in conjunction with positron emission tomography.", 
    "32": "90 alcoholic patients (II stage of alcoholism) with secondary affective disorders (anxiety, depression) were divided into 4 groups. The patients of the first group received the GABA receptor ligand baclofen during 3 weeks. Sybazon preparation was used in the second group, while the patients of the third group were treated with amitriptyline. Placebo was applied in the forth group. The clinical psychological tests demonstrated that all drugs caused quite effective relief of affective disorders. Psychosemantic tests application showed that the pharmacotherapy caused positive changes in patients of 1-3 groups. These changes touched on both system of personal estimations and relations of personality to himself and to the world around i.e. psychosemantic sphere. Such changes in psychosemantic sphere were not observed in the 4-th group of patients (placebo). Besides it was revealed that each drug caused some specific changes in psychosemantic sphere. The result obtained were supposed to have some theoretical value in comprehension of brain-psychics relations as well as the applied significance for adequate choice of affective disorders pharmacotherapy of alcoholic patients.", 
    "33": "Clinical investigators recently have studied at least 21 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in people with epilepsy. This review briefly examines 15 of these new AEDs: clobazam (CLB), dezinamide, flunarizine (FNR), loreclezole, milacemide (MLM), MK-801, nafimidone, ORG-6370, oxcarbazepine (OCBZ), progabide (PGB), ralitoline, stiripentol, tiagabine (TGB), topiramate (TPM), and zonisamide (ZNS). CLB, PGB, and TGB represent agents that act on the GABA system, and MLM acts on the glycine system. MK-801 and ZNS (in part) are excitatory amino acid antagonists, and FNR is a calcium-channel antagonist. OCBZ is a keto analogue of carbamazepine, which is not metabolized to the epoxide and may have fewer side effects. The remaining agents are novel compounds with a variety of suspected mechanisms. TPM appears especially effective for intractable partial seizures but has a high incidence of cognitive side effects. None of these new AEDs is useful for all patients with inadequate seizure control or ongoing toxicity. The role of each will require further clinical study and experience.", 
    "34": "Antiepileptic drug (AED) selection is based primarily on efficacy for specific seizure types and epileptic syndromes. However, efficacy is often similar for the different AEDs, and other properties such as adverse effects, pharmacokinetic properties, and cost may also be of importance. For idiopathic generalized epilepsies with absence, tonic-clonic, and myoclonic seizures, the AED of choice is valproate (VPA). Secondarily generalized epilepsies with tonic, atonic, and other seizure types are difficult to treat with any single AED or combination of AEDs. The AEDs of choice for absence seizures are ethosuximide (ESM) and VPA. For control of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, any of the other major AEDs can be effective. If VPA cannot be prescribed, carbamazepine (CBZ), phenobarbital (PB), phenytoin (PHT), or primidone (PRM) may be effective, but ESM or a benzodiazepine (BZD) must be added to control associated absence or myoclonic seizures. The AEDs of first choice for partial epilepsies with partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures are CBZ and PHT. Increasing evidence suggests that VPA is a good alternative when CBZ and PHT fail. PB and PRM are second-choice selections because of adverse effects. A combination of two of the five standard AEDs may be necessary to treat intractable seizures, but no studies have been done to indicate an optimal combination. Other epilepsy syndromes such as neonatal and infantile epilepsies, febrile epilepsy, alcoholic epilepsy, and status epilepticus require specific AED treatment. Ultimately, AED selection must be individualized. No \"drug of choice\" can be named for all patients. The expected efficacy for the seizure type, the importance of the expected adverse effects, the pharmacokinetics, and the cost of the AEDs all must be weighed and discussed with the patient before a choice is made. A number of new AEDs with unique mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetic properties, and fewer adverse effects hold important promise of improved epilepsy treatment.", 
    "35": "Established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) decrease membrane excitability by interacting with neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels. AEDs developed before 1980 appear to act on sodium channels, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, or calcium channels. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates enhance GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition. Phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), and possibly valproate (VPA) decrease high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials by enhancing sodium-channel inactivation. Ethosuximide (ESM) and VPA reduce a low threshold (T-type) calcium-channel current. The mechanisms of action of the new AEDs are not fully established. Gabapentin (GBP) binds to a high-affinity site on neuronal membranes in a restricted regional distribution of the central nervous system. This binding site may be related to a possible active transport process of GBP into neurons; however, this has not been proven, and the mechanism of action of GBP remains uncertain. Lamotrigine (LTG) decreases sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of voltage-dependent sodium action potentials that may result in a preferential decreased release of presynaptic glutamate. The mechanism of action of oxcarbazepine (OCBZ) is not known; however, its similarity in structure and clinical efficacy to CBZ suggests that its mechanism of action may involve inhibition of sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of voltage-dependent sodium action potentials. Vigabatrin (VGB) irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase, the enzyme that degrades GABA, thereby producing greater available pools of presynaptic GABA for release in central synapses. Increased activity of GABA at postsynaptic receptors may underline the clinical efficacy of VGB.", 
    "36": "Among the brain imaging techniques developed during the past two decades positron emission tomography has the highest sensitivity, allowing the analysis of specific neurotransmitter mechanisms in the living human brain. By using a combination of selective ligands labelled with positron emitting isotopes, D1 and D2 dopamine, serotonin 5HT2 and benzodiazepine receptors were examined in schizophrenic patients (DSM-IIIR) and healthy control subjects. With this technique receptor populations could be excellently visualized and quantified with regard to number and binding characteristics in several brain regions. The characteristics of total D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations in the caudate and putamen did not differ significantly in young drug naive schizophrenic patients and age matched control subjects. On the other hand, there was a highly significant reduction of the D1 signal in high intensity regions of the basal ganglia when [11C]SCH 23390, a selective D1 dopamine receptor antagonist, was used. These results suggest the possibility of a reduced D1 dopamine receptor density in the patch compartment of the basal ganglia in schizophrenia. For 5HT2 and benzodiazepine receptors no major alteration of receptor characteristics was observed in several neocortical and limbic brain regions.", 
    "37": "This study summarizes the results of examination of acute oral toxicity of 26 organophosphorus insecticides in rats. The effectiveness of trimedoxime, obidoxime, pralidoxime and HI-6, given with atropine and diazepam, was tested in the treatment of poisoning with 2 LD50 of the insecticides. It was shown that the oximes were potent antidotes in poisoning with phosphate insecticides. Obidoxime, pralidoxime and HI-6 had low effectiveness in the treatment of poisoning with phosphonates and phosphorothiolates. However, none of the oximes was an effective antidote in poisoning with dimethoate and pyridafenthion. Trimedoxime was the most effective oxime in the treatment of insecticide poisoning, being successful especially at the lowest tested doses.", 
    "38": "Substantial proportions of patients with schizophrenia do not achieve acceptable levels of response with antipsychotic therapy alone, which commonly leads clinicians to use additional somatic interventions. This article reviews the literature on the use of adjunctive pharmacological treatments and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in schizophrenia. The authors find that, despite a large volume of literature, it is difficult to draw conclusions or treatment recommendations from available data because of small sample sizes and widely divergent study designs. At present, there is little firm evidence that adding adjunctive agents to standard neuroleptics will dramatically change the somatic treatment of schizophrenia. The most promising adjunctive agents are benzodiazepines, lithium, and carbamazepine, as well as antidepressants and ECT for affective symptoms. Future inpatient research on adjunctive treatments should be multicenter studies, followed by long-term outpatient trials that assess quality-of-life issues as well as symptom relief.", 
    "39": "The term \"prodromal symptoms\" has traditionally referred to prepsychotic changes in thought, affect, and cognition that precede the initial onset of schizophrenia. Recently, however, the term has been extended into a clinical action context to refer to the early warning signs (EWS) of impending relapse in patients already diagnosed as having schizophrenia. However, recent reports reviewed by Norman and Malla (1995, this issue) use a narrow definition of prodromal symptoms and question their use in the clinical action context. We argue that the dual use of the term \"prodromal symptoms\" has led to conceptual confusion and to the impression that EWS cannot be used effectively for clinical action. The ability to base clinical action on EWS is central to schizophrenia therapeutics and is the cornerstone of pharmacological strategies based on early intervention. Our review of the evidence suggests that the effective clinical use of EWS depends on (1) the inclusion of both psychotic and nonpsychotic symptoms as EWS; (2) the use of clinician judgment in combination with predefined symptom changes to define the occurrence of EWS; (3) frequent clinical visits; and (4) the use of family or caregiver informants. We therefore suggest that, in the clinical action context, the terminology \"early warning signs of impending relapse\" should be used instead.", 
    "40": "In a companion paper the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine was found to produce a dose-dependent anticonflict effect in a modified Vogel's conflict test. The behavioral data further indicated that noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons as well as the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor may be involved in the anticonflict effect of yohimbine. In the present study the effects on rat brain monoamine neurochemistry and GABAA/BDZ receptor function (36Cl-uptake in corticohippocampal synaptoneurosomes) of a maximally anticonflict producing dose of yohimbine (4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) were studied. The levels of rat brain catecholamines and indoleamines were measured ex vivo using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED). Yohimbine decreased noradrenaline levels both in the hippocampus and the hemispheres but instead increased DOPAC levels in these brain regions as well as in the limbic forebrain. Yohimbine also markedly enhanced DOPA accumulation in the hippocampus and the hemispheres after inhibition of 1-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by means of NSD 1015, whereas in the limbic system only a modest increase was obtained. The yohimbine-induced effects on the catecholamine synthesis rate were largely abolished in animals severely depleted of NA by means of 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OH-DA) pretreatment. Yohimbine decreased both the 5-HIAA/5-HT quotient (an indicator of 5-HT turnover) and 5-HTP accumulation after NSD 1015 in the hemispheres, whereas in the hippocampus and the limbic system only 5-HTP accumulation was decreased. The yohimbine-induced effect on the indoleamine synthesis rate was not influenced by 6-OH-DA pretreatment, whereas this effect and that on the catecholamine synthesis rate were both abolished by reserpine pretreatment. Neither in vivo nor in vitro administration of yohimbine significantly altered baseline or GABA-induced accumulation of 36Cl- in corticohippocampal synaptoneurosomes. In conclusion, the present study provides neurochemical support for the suggestion that yohimbine may exert its anticonflict effect in a modified Vogel's conflict test by increasing and decreasing NA and 5-HT neurotransmission, respectively, whereas no evidence was obtained for a direct interaction of yohimbine with GABAA/BDZ receptor function.", 
    "41": "The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine has in several previous studies been found to produce anticonflict effects comparable to those produced by the benzodiazepines (BDZ) in rat punished conflict models. In this and a following paper we have tried to elucidate the neurochemical mechanisms underlying these effects in a modified Vogel's drinking conflict test. Since yohimbine previously has been demonstrated to interfere both with noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) neurochemistry, and, in addition, shows affinity for the BDZ binding site, we have focused on the putative involvement of these neuronal systems in the yohimbine-induced anticonflict effect. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (10 micrograms/kg, i.p.) completely antagonized the anticonflict effect of yohimbine (4.0 mg/kg, i.p.), whereas the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist ST 587 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect. The anticonflict effect of yohimbine was totally abolished also following lesioning of NA neurons with 6-hydroxy-dopamine. A high dose of the mixed beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (8.0 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a partial blockade of the yohimbine-induced effect in intact animals, whereas the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) had no significant effect and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin instead potentiated the anticonflict action. The anticonflict effect of yohimbine was dose-dependently antagonized also by the 5-HT precursor L-5-hydroxytryptophan (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.). The BDZ receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg, p.o.), as well as Ro 15-4513 (1.0 mg/kg, p.o.), a partial inverse agonist at BDZ receptors, partly, but significantly, counteracted the yohimbine-induced anticonflict effect, whereas low doses of both the chloride channel blocker picrotoxin and the GABAA antagonist bicuculline only tended to counteract the yohimbine effect. Taken together, the results in the present behavioral paper indicate that the anticonflict effect of yohimbine involves both increased NA and decreased 5-HT activity, and that direct or indirect activation of BDZ receptors may also be involved. Neurochemical findings related to these behavioral results are presented in a following paper.", 
    "42": "The study of pathophysiological and symptomatological characteristics of pain in emergency situations, and of its harmful consequences, shows that, in spite of a difficult context, analgesia is an essential part of the care to patients during the prehospital stage. Its prescription implies a good knowledge of analgesia techniques, including precise rules such as titration. The choice of analgesia must be the outcome of a rigorous step giving priority to the vital functions and associating several techniques. Regional anaesthesia is not very often used in prehospital emergency but rather in emergency units and in the surgical ward. Analgesia must be adapted, mainly to specific situations in emergency: children, old people, burned people with pain.", 
    "43": "The authors used Midazolam in dental treatment of 225 patients of both sexes (ASA I-IV). 25 patients suffering from heart diseases (ASA III-IV) were ECG monitored during the treatment. Midazolam with the biological half-life of 0.5-1.5 hours was successfully used for premedication of dental out-patients. The used doses had no significant influence on hemodynamic and respiratory values. Specific antagonist Flumazenil reduced the period of psychological recovery of the patients and thus made it possible for the patients to be dismissed within 30 minutes after the dental treatment if accompanied.", 
    "44": "A simple rapid and sensitive HPLC method for simultaneous determination of N-demethyldiazepam and its metabolite oxazepam in both human and rat plasma was described. A reversed phase C18 column equipped with a 240 nm detector were selected. Diazepam was used as internal standard. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile--0.01 mol.L-1 sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8, 33.3: 66.6 v/v). The retention time for N-demethyldiazepam, oxazepam and internal standard were 4.85 min, 2.8 min and 8.5 min, respectively. The lower detection limits for oxazepam and N-demethyldiazepam were 10 ng.ml-1 and 7 ng.ml-1, respectively. The precisions (RSD%, n = 5) of within-day and day-to-day were less than 6% and 10% and their absolute recoveries were 74% and 86%, respectively. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of N-demethyldiazepam in Sprague-Dawley rats after a single oral dose of 2.5 mg.kg-1 was investigated by this method. The concentration-time curve was fitted to a two-compartment open model. Its main pharmacokinetic parameters were: Tmax = 0.24 h, Cmax = 1211.78 ng.ml-1, T1/2 beta = 2.84 h, AUC = 1264 ng.ml-1.h-1.", 
    "45": "The in vivo formation of the diazepam-like 1,4-benzodiazepine deschloronordiazepam from its assumed biogenetic precursors, 2-amino-benzophenone and glycine, by the mould strain Penicillium verrucosum var. verrucosum, is described. Deschloronordiazepam formation was established by GC/MSD analysis monitoring characteristic fragment patterns of the benzodiazepine moiety. The identification of deschloronordiazepam was confirmed by feeding experiments of D5-2-aminobenzophenone, as well as its brominated and chlorinated derivatives to the mould. The formation of the 1,4-benzodiazepine was observed to depend on various factors, e.g. the time of application of the precursors, duration of the incubation and kind of cultivation. The results represent the first actual de novo synthesis of such diazepam-like 1,4-benzodiazepines from plausible biosynthetic precursors in a living organism, in agreement with a biosynthetic concept recently established in our group. Such pharmacologically active 1,4-benzodiazepines had been detected in trace amounts in mammalian and plant tissues. Because of their unusual molecular framework, they had previously been considered not to fit into any conventional biosynthetic route.", 
    "46": "The behavioural and neurochemical effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist dizocilpine and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole- 4-propionic acid (AMPA) antagonist GYKI 52466, given alone or in combination, were investigated in rats. Locomotor activity was increased by dizocilpine (0.2 mg/kg), but not by GYKI 52466 (2.4 mg/kg). Dizocilpine-induced hyperlocomotion was reduced by co-administration of GYKI 52466. In dizocilpine-treated rats dopamine (DA) metabolism (measured as DOPAC [dihydroxyphenylacetic acid] or DOPAC/DA in post mortem brain tissue) was increased in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. In GYKI 52466-treated rats serotonin was reduced in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens while DA metabolism was not affected. In rats treated with dizocilpine plus GYKI 52466, DA metabolism was increased only in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens, when compared with vehicle-treated animals. These data confirm that AMPA and NMDA antagonists do not have synergistic effects on locomotor activity. A differential role of NMDA and AMPA antagonists in the control of mesolimbic DA neurons will be discussed here.", 
    "47": "Flumazenil is safe and highly effective at reversing both benzodiazepine-induced sedation and amnesia. Bolus intravenous injection is the most appropriate technique when the goal is to fully reverse conscious sedation. Currently, the proven effective dose of flumazenil is 0.5 mg. For practical purposes, in this clinical setting, true resedation does not occur, and if the appropriate type and dose of agonist have been used, residual sedation is not a clinical problem. Concerns over acute anxiety reactions and precipitation of acute withdrawal syndrome in chronic benzodiazepine users remain theoretical and unsubstantiated by human data. Further clinical studies are required to determine whether the clinical practice of using flumazenil could include this group of patients. Depression of ventilatory responsiveness induced by benzodiazepines can be reversed effectively and promptly by flumazenil. Flumazenil must be immediately available as an emergency drug in any area where benzodiazepines are used. The clinical and economic benefits of elective and routine use of flumazenil have been demonstrated, but yet to gain widespread acceptance.", 
    "48": "Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine, is the first benzodiazepine antagonist available for clinical use. It is a specific competitive antagonist at benzodiazepine receptors, which are associated with receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid, the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Administered orally, it has a low bioavailability and the preferred route is intravenous. Its usual clinical role is to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine sedation; however, administered before, or with, other benzodiazepines, it modifies their effects, the extent of such modification depending on the dose, duration of effect and relative receptor affinity of the agonist. Flumazenil also reverses adverse physiological effects of benzodiazepines. Its indications include reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation, termination of benzodiazepine-induced anaesthesia, return of spontaneous respiration and consciousness in intensive care patients and the treatment of paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines. Other potential indications include its use in hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol intoxication and coma; however, these claims still require substantiation. Following sedation reversed with flumazenil, minimal residual effects of the agonist can sometimes be detected using psychomotor tests and are due to the relatively short half-life of flumazenil, but are of no clinical consequence. There is concern that flumazenil could precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome following long-term benzodiazepine administration; however, the available evidence suggests otherwise and that it could be useful in the treatment of benzodiazepine tolerance. The existence of flumazenil is important, with implications for future research and the development of minimally invasive therapy and day-case surgery. With increasing pressures on non-anaesthetically trained practitioners to perform sedation, flumazenil has important implications for safety.", 
    "49": "Flumazenil is a specific benzodiazepine antagonist. It competitively inhibits the action of benzodiazepines at gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system and thus reverses the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. Usually, it is given intravenously as a bolus dose or as an infusion. It has a short duration of action. Flumazenil is extensively metabolized to compounds that have minimal benzodiazepine antagonistic properties. Reversal of sedation can be useful in many conditions that are often encountered in the critically ill. The adverse effects of its use are usually predictable and, with sufficient clinical monitoring, are usually avoidable. These properties make it a useful and safe drug when used appropriately.", 
    "50": "Flumazenil, the first benzodiazepine antagonist, is currently used widely as an emergency drug, and has also been utilized in planned procedures, to time arousal intra- or post-operatively. It is known that flumazenil, used at the end of a procedure, causes instant recovery by reversing the residual effects of, for example, midazolam. An agonist-antagonist concept, midazolam-flumazenil, where benzodiazepine sedation or anaesthesia is terminated at will, is, therefore, finding increasing application. In neuroanaesthesia, for example, it facilitates immediate recovery, cardiovascular stabilization and the use of midazolam as an alternative to thiopentone and inhalational agents, and in ear, nose and throat endoscopies, it permits more rapid turnover of patients and is a good choice for haemodynamic stability in patients with a high cardiovascular risk factor. There continues to be debate over the term used to describe the level of sedation remaining after the effects of the antagonist have worn off. 'Resedation' is often used incorrectly to describe what is in reality residual sedation. Given the correct use of midazolam or the exploitation of synergism using opioids, flumazenil will cause arousal, while maintaining the benefit of opioid analgesia. Such a technique may eliminate the need for formal recovery facilities in many ambulatory patients, thereby reducing dependence on trolleys, beds and nurses. This has major implications for health economics, particularly in relation to endoscopy clinics and when co-induction of anaesthesia is employed.", 
    "51": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, acute effects of suriclone--a cyclopyrrolone derivative--were investigated by means of topographic mapping of event-related potentials (ERPs). Fifteen normal volunteers, aged 22-35 years, received randomized, oral single doses of placebo, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg suriclone and 1 mg alprazolam as a reference compound. ERPs were investigated in an auditory oddball paradigm before and 3 h after intake of each drug. In addition to 17 EEG leads, vertical and horizontal electro-oculograms (EOGs) were recorded. After EOG minimization and artifact identification, the peak latencies of the spatial average were determined by an automatic procedure. Compared to placebo, no significant effects of the low and middle doses of suriclone on N1 amplitude were observed; the highest dosage reduced N1 amplitude, as did 1 mg alprazolam to an even greater extent. While no consistent effects on P2 amplitude were observed after suriclone, alprazolam reduced P2 amplitude. P300 amplitude was reduced only after the highest dosage of suriclone, but much more so after alprazolam. P300 latency was not affected significantly by suriclone, but a marked prolongation of P300 latency was observed after 1 mg alprazolam. Concerning N1 and P2 effects, alprazolam, but not suriclone, may have an inhibitory influence on stimulus-induced cortical arousal. Concerning P300 effects, the used doses of suriclone were superior to 1 mg alprazolam, which seemed to have reduced cognitive information processing capacity and prolonged stimulus evaluation time. Self-rated well-being (adjective checklist) showed subtle beneficial effects after 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg, but marked sedative effects after both 0.4 mg suriclone and 1 mg alprazolam.", 
    "52": "The mortality rate among drug users is higher than that of the general population. There is some evidence that the risk of suicide is also higher, although major methodological difficulties tend to cast doubt on their accuracy. The factors generally known to be associated with suicide such as mental and physical health problems, poor family relationships, social isolation and stressful life events are also associated with drug misuse. Illicit drugs may be used as a form of self-medication for anxiety and depression, but this draws an individual into a life that is likely to increase stress levels. For a drug user already stigmatized and detached from conventional society, becoming HIV positive can lead to greater stress and isolation. The impact of HIV on individuals physically and psychologically damaged by drug misuse is difficult to predict. There is little research that is attempting to determine who is most at risk and the nature of the factors that will predict an attempt at self-harm. If those who are most likely to attempt suicide are to be detected and adequate care provided by health professionals, risk and protective factors need to be identified in drug-using communities in which HIV is present or likely to occur.", 
    "53": "Clorazepate dipotassium (Tranxilium) is one of the benzodiazepines which is widely used for oral premedication. After oral administration it is decarboxylated to its active metabolite nordiazepam (desmethyldiazepam). Nordiazepam is also commercially available in the form of drops (Tranxilium N). The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of these drugs on preoperative anxiety. One hundred and eight patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery (ASA I-II) were studied. Medication was administered at 10 p.m. the evening before surgery (E) and at 7 a.m. on the morning of surgery (M). There were four groups: 1) E no medication; M clorazepate dipotassium; 2) E no medication; M nordiazepam; 3) E clorazepate dipotassium; M clorazepate dipotassium, 4) E clorazepate dipotassium; M nordiazepam. Dosages were: clorazepate dipotassium: body weight < 55 kg: 10 mg; body weight > 55 kg: 20 mg; nordiazepam: 1 gtt/kg; 5 mg = 24 gtt). Anxiety was measured by using the self-evaluating Erlangen anxiety scales, which measure both background and situational anxiety. Background anxiety (EAS-H) was evaluated during the evening before surgery; situational anxiety (EAS-S) was evaluated at the same time and also on the day of surgery before premedication and immediately before surgery. Pulse rate was measured each time the test was administered. There were no differences between the groups in sex, age, weight or the intervals between premedication and anaesthesia induction (p > 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to background anxiety. Situational anxiety did not significantly increase or decrease at any of the testing times, nor were there any differences between the groups (p > 0.05). Heart rate did not vary between the groups or with time (p > 0.05). In this group of patients undergoing elective orthopaedic procedures, clorazepate prevented a rise in anxiety in the immediate preoperative period. Since clorazepate is rapidly metabolized to nordiazepam when administered orally it might be predicted that the two drugs have similar properties. This hypothesis is confirmed by the results of the present study. We conclude that orally administered clorazepate dipotassium and nordiazepam have a similar effect on preoperative anxiety.", 
    "54": "Eighty urological patients, divided in two equal groups, are anesthesized using two anaesthetic combinations: small dose kaliposol + etomidate, or diazepam. The obtained results point to a stability of the arterial pressure and pulse rate and prompt recovery, rendering the kalipsol-etomidate combination an alternative to the kalipsol-diazepam one which is well affirmed in urological practice.", 
    "55": "We have previously shown that in urethane-anesthetized rats the frequency of rhythmical slow activity in the hippocampus (\"theta\") is controlled by the medial supramammillary nucleus (SuM). In particular, injections of procaine into SuM in urethane-anesthetized animals reduce the frequency of theta. However, it has been reported that, in freely moving animals, lesions of SuM do not affect theta. The present experiments were designed to resolve this anomaly. Injections of procaine or chlordiazepoxide into SuM in urethane-anesthetized animals reduced the frequency of theta elicited by reticular stimulation. Mapping showed that procaine injections in freely moving animals were effective in the same locations as under urethane anesthesia. Injections of chlordiazepoxide were effective in a more restricted area than procaine, consistent with an action on synapses in SuM and sparing fibers afferent to SuM. Analysis of the functional spread indicated an effective radius of diffusion of the drugs of 500 microns. With optimal placements, this implied an action on at least 80% of SuM. However, in contrast to the results under urethane, the maximal frequency reductions obtained were less than 50% of the theoretical maximum. In a number of animals receiving repeated injections into SuM, lesions developed which encompassed the whole of SuM. As previously reported, theta was largely intact in SuM-lesioned animals. However, the frequency of theta produced by reticular stimulation was reduced after lesion by approximately the same amount as by procaine injections before lesion. These results suggest that in freely moving animals SuM is only one of two or more nuclei which jointly control the frequency of reticular-elicited theta.", 
    "56": "Studies in humans in vivo have demonstrated that substances found in grapefruit juice may increase the bioavailability of dihydropyridine derivatives as a result of the inhibition of liver enzyme activities by flavonoids found in grapefruit. Since the metabolism of dihydropyridine drugs is mediated by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, it has been hypothesized that flavonoids may also influence the metabolism of other drugs, such as midazolam and quinidine, which are biotransformed by the same CYP isoform. Three flavonoids, kaempferol, naringenin and quercetin, are found in grapefruit juice but not in orange juice. The effect of these substances on the metabolism of midazolam and quinidine has been investigated in human liver microsomes. In the concentration range 10-160 microM the inhibitory potential of flavonoids was the same for both of the tested drugs; it decreased in the order quercetin > kaempferol > naringenin. The data suggest that the flavonoids found in grapefruit juice may influence the kinetics of midazolam and quinidine in man.", 
    "57": "Convulsive activity of N-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-propoxy-phenyl-ethyl)-aziridine (FAZ-4), a newly synthesized aziridine compound was studied in rats. There is a lack of tonic component of major paroxysm in comparison with the classical convulsive agent pentylenetetrazol. This effect of FAZ-4 is probably due to the forebrain mechanism without the midbrain involvement. Both anticonvulsants tested suppressed seizures in a different manner, however triazolam exerted stronger anticonvulsive activity than the same dose of diazepam did.", 
    "58": "We have characterised the muscarinic receptor subtypes found in human skin fibroblasts and compared binding levels in cell lines from members of the Alzheimer's disease family with the Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APP) 670/671 mutation. Binding studies with [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) and the M2/M4 selective antagonist [3H] (+/-)-5,11-dihydro-11-([(2-[(di-propylamino)methyl]-1- piperidinyl]ethyl)amino]carbonyl)-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6- one ([3H]AF-DX 384) revealed the presence of a single population of muscarinic receptors on lysed fibroblast membranes. [3H]QNB binding was displaced by a number of selective muscarinic ligands with a rank order of potency: atropine > himbacine > methoctramine > (+/-)-p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol hydrochloride > pirenzepine > muscarinic-toxin-3. APP 670/671 mutation carrying cell lines showed 25-35% lower levels of muscarinic receptors labelled with [3H]QNB, [3H]N-methyl scopolamine and [3H]AF-DX 384, compared to controls. This difference was not statistically significant due to large individual variation. It is concluded that muscarinic receptors on adult skin fibroblasts are predominantly of the M2 subtype. Since these cells do not possess M1 and M3 receptor subtypes, they are unlikely to provide a good model for studying muscarinic receptor regulation of APP processing.",

Immediately before and 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min after application of the drug 2.5 ml blood was sampled for plasma levels of midazolam. Endtidal CO2, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded as long as the children were intubated. Endtidal CO2 and respiratory rate showed no statistical difference between the groups at any time, however, in the group receiving 0.6 mg.kg-1, endtidal CO2 increased significantly from 5.3 kPa (41 mm Hg) at the start to 5.9 kPa (45.5 mm Hg) after 30 min. Plasma levels of midazolam were detected 2 min after application in 10 of 15 patients. Median peak levels were found between 12 and 16 min. Medians of peak plasma levels showed no statistical difference between the three groups (0.2 mg.kg-1:111 ng.ml-1, 0.4 mg.kg-1:136 ng.ml-1, 0.6 mg.kg-1:277 ng.ml-1). After 30, 60 and 120 min medians of midazolam plasma concentration were significantly higher in the group 0.6 mg.kg-1.", 
    "60": "Convulsive activity of N-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-propoxy-phenyl-ethyl)-aziridine (FAZ-4), a newly synthetized aziridine compound was studied in rats. There is a lack of tonic component of major paroxysm in comparison with the classical convulsive agent pentylenetetrazol. This effect of FAZ-4 is probably due to the forebrain mechanism without the midbrain involvement. Both anticonvulsants tested suppressed seizures in a different manner, however triazolam exerted stronger anticonvulsive activity than the same dose of diazepam did.", 
    "61": "We have used the binding of the selective, high affinity, isoquinoline carboxamide, [3H]-PK11195, to measure the levels of Peripheral Benzodiazpine Receptors (PBR) in the brain of rats exposed to the well characterized neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT). The results demonstrate that autoradiograms of saggital sections of rats injected with a 8 mg/kg TMT dose, express a high level of [3H]-PK11195 binding in brain regions known to be damaged by TMT. The highest level of [3H]-PK11195 binding in the TMT-exposed rats occurred in the CA3/CA4 subfield of the hippocampus, followed by the primary olfactory cortex, the posteriomedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. These findings are consistent with the neuropathology of TMT in rats. The increase in [3H]-PK11195 binding in the brain of TMT-exposed rats was significant at 7 days after injection and remained elevated up to 42 days after exposure, the last time point measured in the study. This pattern is very similar to that observed for levels of the astrocyte intermediate filament protein, GFAP. The enhanced binding of [3H]-PK11195 in TMT-exposed rats was the result of a significant increase (p < 0.005) in the number of PBR with no change in affinity. The Bmax for [3H]-PK11195 binding in hippocampi from TMT-treated rats at 4 weeks post-injection was 606 +/- 25 (n = 4) fmoles/mg protein and 329 +/- 41 (n = 4) fmoles/mg protein for control. These findings suggest that the quantitative assessment of [3H]-PK11195 binding to PBR in the brain could represent a potential biomarker for assessing chemical-induced neurotoxicity. Since this ligand has been labeled with single photon (123I) or positron emitting (11C, 18F) radioisotopes, it can potentially be used with non-invasive imaging techniques such as Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for human studies.", 
    "62": "Twelve subjects (8 male) took part in a randomised double blind four way crossover design study comparing four treatments: (i) morphine sulphate 10 mg, (ii) morphine sulphate 15 mg, (iii) lorazepam 1 mg (positive control) and (iv) placebo. Cognitive function was assessed using choice reaction time, number vigilance, memory scanning, immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition, picture recognition, critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT) and subjective measures of alertness, calmness and contentment. Lorazepam produced a marked impairment in the tests of attention and memory. CFFT was reduced from 1-4 h but this only reached significance at 4 hours. The subjective measures suggested impaired alertness but this did not reach significance. The effects of morphine were less dramatic; both doses of morphine produced significant impairment at 1 hour on tests of secondary memory retrieval (delayed word recall and picture recognition sensitivity). CFFT was reduced for the whole observation period (6 h) achieving statistical significance at 4 hours. Morphine 15 mg produced a significant improvement in accuracy on the choice reaction time test at the 2, 4 and 6 h assessments. These results show minimal impairment of cognitive and psychomotor function after single oral doses of morphine and with possible improvement in one test. Further studies are required to examine the effect of repeated doses.", 
    "63": "Twelve subjects (3 male) took part in a randomised double-blind four way crossover study designed to examine the cognitive and psychomotor effects of single doses of dextroproxyphene. On four study days one week apart each subject received each study product (i) dextropropoxyphene napsylate 100 mg, (ii) dextropropoxyphene napsylate 200 mg, (iii) lorazepam 2 mg and (iv) placebo. Performance measures were simple reaction time, choice reaction time, number vigilance, memory scanning, word recall (immediate and delayed), word recognition, picture recognition, critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT) and visual analogue scales of alertness, calmness and contentment. Lorazepam had a marked effect on the range of tests used illustrating the sensitivity of the best battery. This was in contrast to the effects of dextropropoxyphene. A dose related effect in CFFT was detected, the 200 mg dose producing a significant decrease in CFFT throughout the testing period. Dextropropoxyphene also showed a tendency to improve scores on the verbal memory tasks. These data indicate that dextropropoxyphene in the usual doses does not produce significant impairment of cognitive and psychomotor function.", 
    "64": "The actions of sex steroids in the brain have been shown, from molecular to systems levels, to control reproductive behaviour in a wide range of vertebrates. It has become increasingly clear that gonadal steroid hormones have regulatory functions which extend far beyond the direct coordination of an animal's physiological state and its display of sexual behaviour. While some of these actions may include changes in mood or other behavioural measures, such as exploration or excitability, sex steroid hormones also influence neural plasticity, neuronal activity and, possibly, learning and memory, as reflected by long-term potentiation or age-related deficits. Here we describe two systems that have been used to explore the non-reproductive roles of gonadal steroid hormones. The first of these is to examine the oestrogen-sensitive opioid peptide gene expression in the hypothalamus. Currently, we are attempting to identify the types of behaviour which may be altered consequent to the oestrogenic induction of the preproenkephalin gene. The second approach involves studying the effects of progesterone at the neuronal cell membrane and characterizing the metabolites of progesterone which have benzodiazepine-like actions in the brain. A number of studies suggest that this may provide an alternative mechanism through which progesterone can influence mood or behaviour.", 
    "65": "A critical mass of evidence now supports the existence of a novel class of neuroactive steroids. These steroids are devoid of any known steroid hormone activity and have high specificity for the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex (GRC), which is a ligand-gated chloride channel that mediates the inhibitory action of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The action of these steroids at the GRC is to allosterically potentiate the effect of GABA on chloride channel conductance through a unique site on the GRC. These neuroactive steroids have been termed the epalons, a shortened form of epiallopregnanolone, an endogenous metabolite of progesterone with potent actions at the GRC. Putative epalon receptors may be unique sites on the GRC that mediate the effects of epalons on GABA-gated channel function. The pharmacological profile of the epalons is consistent with those of other positive modulators of GABA action (e.g., the clinically useful benzodiazepines (BZs) and barbiturates). These neuroactive steroids have anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative-hypnotic properties. Based upon some of the unique characteristics of the epalons relative to barbiturates and the BZs, it is plausible that the epalons can be developed into a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of anxiety, epilepsy, and insomnia.", 
    "66": "The topic of this study was to evaluate state-dependent effects of diazepam on the frequency characteristics of 47-channel spontaneous EEG maps. A novel method, the FFT-Dipole-Approximation (Lehmann and Michel, 1990), was used to study effects on the strength and the topography of the maps in the different frequency bands. Map topography was characterized by the 3-dimensional location of the equivalent dipole source and map strength was defined as the spatial standard deviation (the Global Field Power) of the maps of each frequency point. The Global Field Power can be considered as a measure of the amount of energy produced by the system, while the source location gives an estimate of the center of gravity of all sources in the brain that were active at a certain frequency. State-dependency was studied by evaluating the drug effects before and after a continuous performance task of 25 min duration. Clear interactions between drug (diazepam vs. placebo) and time after drug intake (before and after the task) were found, especially in the inferior-superior location of the dipole sources. It supports the hypothesis that diazepam, like other drugs, has different effects on brain functions depending on the momentary functional state of the brain. In addition to the drug effects, clearly different source locations and Global Field Power were found for the different frequency bands, replicating earlier reports (Michel et al., 1992).", 
    "67": "Successful liver transplantation depends on adequate preservation of cellular function. We therefore tested the effects of two currently used liver preservation fluids, Euro-Collins (EC) solution and University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, on the viability and some functional activities of hepatocytes isolated from human livers. Cells in primary culture were maintained under hypoxic (95% N2/5% CO2) and hypothermic (4 degrees C) conditions for 24 h, either in EC or UW solution. This treatment did not result in significant hepatocyte damage, as judged by phase contrast microscopy, intracellular LDH release, and the MTT mitochondrial test. However, neutral red uptake indicated that lysosomal functions were slightly affected (35% decrease) when compared to control conditions. At the end of the hypoxia/hypothermia period, hepatocyte monolayers were incubated at 37 degrees C under normoxic conditions for 24 h, in order to simulate the reperfusion of a transplanted liver. Three drugs--midazolam, diazepam, zidovudine--were used as diagnostic substrates to check the metabolic abilities of human hepatocytes replaced in normal conditions. Both phase I (hydroxylation, demethylation) and phase II (glucuronidation) metabolic reactions were affected by the hypoxia/hypothermia shock. Indeed, a 30%-50% decrease in these activities was observed as compared to values obtained in control hepatocytes. No difference could, however, be found at the cellular level regarding the solution used for cold storage. These results suggest that the superiority of UW over EC solution, already reported in clinical practice after transplantation of preserved human livers, was not due to a better preservation of the hepatocytes.", 
    "68": "Lorazepam and oxazepam are benzodiazepine which differ by the presence, or not, of chlorine atom on the phenyl ring. These molecules are able of chemical and thermal degradation with water intramolecular elimination between hydroxy and amine functional group and formation of carboxaldehyde quinazoline. These substances characterise lorazepam and oxazepam by their thermal behaviour and melting temperature by heating and cooling cycles.", 
    "69": "The goal of this randomized, double blind and multicentric study was to compare the effects of midazolam (M) and placebo (P) administered by titration before puncture for spinal anaesthesia on the comfort of 211 patients scheduled for elective surgery after oral premedication with hydroxyzine. The administered dose of midazolam was 3.4 +/- 1.3 mg (mean +/- SD). Anxiety was nil in 92% of the patients of the M group and in 64% of the patients of the P group (p < 0.001) and memorization of the pain of the puncture was reported in 34% of the patients of the M group and in 66% of the patients of the P group (p < 0.001). However cooperation of the patient and easiness of the puncture were similar in both groups. In conclusion titrated sedation with midazolam before puncture for spinal anaesthesia increases the comfort of the patient.", 
    "70": "The development of an immunochemical procedure for the determination of flunitrazepam in whole blood is described. Flunitrazepam was derivatized in position 3 of the benzodiazepine ring to a hapten which was coupled to a carrier protein. To obtain antibodies, rabbits were immunized with these immunogens and the collected antisera were tested in a heterogeneous, competitive RIA. The antibodies showed a very specific reaction with flunitrazepam and hardly any cross-reactivity with related 1,4-benzodiazepines. Because of its high specificity the antiserum has the advantage of a definite determination of low levels of flunitrazepam without the risk of false-negative results obtained by using the commercially available group-specific test systems. The drug was extracted from whole blood in a simple batch process with a polystyrene suspension and the extracts were measured by RIA. The advantages of an immunochemical system, such as short analysis time and simple sample preparation, and the exactness of a drug-specific method are combined in this procedure, which allowed the specific and very sensitive determination of flunitrazepam in the low therapeutic range.", 
    "71": "The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), via the CCKB receptor, increases behaviors associated with anxiety in laboratory animals and humans. The present experiment assessed the role of endogenous CCKB function in fear-potentiated startle, a test of \"anxiety\" in rats. The amplitude of the acoustic startle response is potentiated if preceded by a stimulus that has been previously paired with shock. Pretreatment with the CCKB antagonist L-365,260 (0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, IP) did not affect baseline acoustic startle amplitudes, but dose-dependently decreased fear-potentiated startle. These results indicate that the specific attenuation of fear-potentiated startle induced by L-365,260 was not due to a general decrease in motor responsivity. The present findings are consistent with the effects of CCKB antagonists in other tests measuring anxiety in animals.", 
    "72": "Effects of the anxiolytic drugs diazepam and buspirone were studied on the reaction time of saccadic eye movements. The study was performed with 8 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled way. The purpose was to investigate the putative drug effects on the first step of an attention shifting task: the disengagement of attention. Saccadic reaction time was measured in two conditions: the 'gap' and the 'overlap' condition. In the first condition a delay is present between the offset of a fixation spot and the onset of a target, while in the second condition the offset of the spot is overlapped by the onset of the target. Clear differences in saccadic reaction time in the expected direction were found between the two conditions, with longer reaction times of saccadic eye movements in the overlap condition. The nonsedative anxiolytic buspirone in a dose of 5 mg had no significant effects on saccadic reaction times, while clear effects of diazepam in a dose of 5 mg were established. Diazepam slowed down saccadic reaction times, reduced the number of fast saccades and facilitated the number of slow saccades. However, the effects induced by this drug were identical for the two conditions. The latter result implies that the disengagement of attention is not selectively disrupted by diazepam. Perhaps, the action of diazepam is expressed in other attention factors, such as in shifting attention or in the reengagement of attention. A slowing down of these processes by the vigilance-lowering properties of diazepam might be the cause of the prolonged latencies. The increased latencies of saccadic eye movements induced by a low dose of diazepam may have practical implications.", 
    "73": "Isomers are two or more different substances with the same molecular formula (i.e., the same number of different types of atoms). There are two main types of isomerism: 1) structural isomerism, and 2) steroisomerism. Structural isomers (e.g., enflurane and isoflurane) have different molecular structures, and usually behave like different drugs. Occasionally, structural isomers are interconvertible (i.e., they are tautomers or dynamic isomers); this occurs with the barbiturates and midazolam. Steroisomers have identical structures, but a different configuration or spatial arrangement. Stereiosomerism in drugs is often due to chirality or \"handedness\"; i.e., the presence of right-handed (R)- and left-handed (S)- forms of drugs which are nonsuperimposable mirror images (\"enantiomers\"). Approximately 60% of anaesthetic agents are chiral drugs; some of these are administered as single enantiomers. However, many synthetic chiral drugs are equal mixtures of (R)- and (S)-isomers, and there are often important differences in their activity and pharmacokinetics. Halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane are chiral drugs with different anaesthetic potencies. Similar differences occur with intravenous anaesthetics; thus, (S) (+)-ketamine causes fewer psychotic emergence reactions, less agitated behaviour, and better intraoperative amnesia and analgesia than its enantiomer. Some local anaesthetics are administered as chiral mixtures; the (S)-isomers have a longer action because of enhanced vasoconstriction. (S)-prilocaine is more slowly metabolized than its enantiomer, while (S)-bupivacaine may produce less cardiotoxicity than (R)-bupivacaine. These differences suggest that some anaesthetic drugs (particularly ketamine and chiral local anaesthetics) should be administered as single enantiomers. In recent years, their synthesis has been greatly simplified, and almost all new drugs may soon be introduced in this form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "22 patients with panic disorder (diagnosis according to ICD-10) were treated with alprazolam (monotherapy) in a dose of 1-2,5 mg/daily during 6 weeks. Disappearance of panic attacks was observed in 59% of cases while in 27% of patients they arose more rarely. The drug's antipanic action was revealed during second week of treatment. The side-effects were typical for benzodiazepine preparations. No one patient refused of drug administration in connection with side-effects development. Prognostically unfavourable signs were found: the high frequency of panic attacks, the presence of atypical marked permanent symptoms in attack structure, as well as the steady vegetative disturbances presence.", 
    "75": "We localized and characterized the binding of [3H](+/-)-L364,718 in canine small intestine circular muscle. The highest densities of [3H]L364,718 binding were located in the fraction enriched in deep muscular plexus synaptosomal membranes. In this fraction [3H]L364,718 binding was of high density (Bmax 136.78 +/- 53.66 fmol/mg) and high affinity (Kd 1.67 +/- 0.74 nM). Kinetics studies revealed that binding was reversible and yielded a similar Kd value. L364,718, CCK-8-S, and L365,260 fully displaced [3H]L364,718 binding, but ligands at CCKB receptors, gastrin-17, and YM022 did not. Therefore, CCKA receptors in canine intestine circular muscle are located on nerve endings.", 
    "76": "Effects of zolpidem, a short acting non benzodiazepine hypnotic, have been studied in eight female poor sleepers, aged 25 to 54 years, documented during two consecutive adaptation nights. Subjects were recorded according to a 22 day single blind study. Placebo was given orally at bedtime on nights 2-4, zolpidem on nights 5-20 and finally placebo on nights 21-22. Polygraphic recordings (conventional analysis) were performed on nights 1-6; 12, 13; 19-22. Parameters of sleep continuity, sleep architecture and cyclical structure of sleep were studied. Zolpidem 10 mg showed a hypnotic effect on poor sleepers. It reduced sleep latency, increased total sleep time and decreased the number of awakenings during all recorded nights. During the first post-drug night a rebound insomnia was observed in two subjects only. Zolpidem did not increase specifically stage 2 to the detriment of stages 3 and 4 but it restored them during the first nights of administration. Study of the rapid eye movements-non rapid eye movements (REM-NREM) sleep cycles structure showed that the increase of stages 3 and 4 occurred only during the first part of the night. Finally, zolpidem had no effect on REM sleep temporal distribution.", 
    "77": "It was shown in the present study that three antagonists of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor, including 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX), 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) and 6-(1H-imidazole-1-yl)-7-nitro-2,3-(1H, 4H)-quinoxalinedione (YM90K), caused marked reversal of akinesia when administered into the entopeduncular nucleus of rats rendered parkinsonian by bilateral substantia nigra pars compacta lesion. These data suggest that centrally active AMPA antagonists may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.", 
    "78": "Blood pressure, heart rate and perspiration were and still are the only clinical signs for recognizing the depth of balanced anaesthesia in combination with muscle relaxants. Even experienced anaesthetists sometimes have difficulties in recognizing the necessary depth of anaesthesia using these parameters and in relatively rare cases the very unpleasant symptom of awareness occurs. Nowadays, processed EEG monitoring (pEEG) is used scientifically and also clinically for exact controlling of general anaesthesia. We report on our first experience with this method in 21 patients who were anaesthetized with propofol, alfentanil and nitrous oxide and relaxed with atracurium and whose depth of anaesthesia was carefully controlled by pEEG using the pEEG Monitor of Dr\u00e4gerwerke. The following parameters were recorded continuously: Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF) 50, SEF 90, SEF 95 and power between 8 and 20 Hz in relation to the power between 0 and 4 Hz (delta ratio). In agreement with other investigators we found that a sufficient depth of anaesthesia could be expected when the SEF 50 ranged between 2 and 6 Hz (4.9 +/- 0.9), the SEF 90 ranged between 10 and 13.5 Hz (11.9 +/- 0.6), the SEF 95 ranged between 14 and 16 Hz (14.8 +/- 0.8) and the delta-ratio ranged between 0.7 and 1.4 (1.1 +/- 0.2). Using this anaesthetic technique and a premedication with benzodiazepine, SEF 90 SEF 95 are the best parameters for monitoring the depth of anaesthesia. In one patient blood pressure and heart rate remained constant intraoperatively, but she described intensive dreams postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "The cases of 85 patients with spinal deformation (m:22, f:63; age: 21.6 +/- 12.9 y.) who underwent the spondylodesis according to Harrington were analysed retrospectively to evaluate the need of pharmacological treatment in the perioperative phase. Central analgetics such as pethidine, piritramide and pentacocine were prescribed most frequently. Propyphenazone containing formulations were the preferred peripheral analgetics. Sedation with benzodiazepines and neuroleptic was used regularly. Flucloxacillin and gentamicin were the flavoured antibiotics for perioperative prophylaxis. Impaired motility of the GIT-tract was treated with drugs such as carbachol or dexpanthenol.", 
    "80": "Previous research both in humans and laboratory animals provides evidence that prenatal exposure to metals, pollutants and drugs may impair the neurobehavioral development of the offspring. This may induce mental and psychomotor disturbances as well as learning, behavioral and sensory disorders. However, proof for a strict causality between some low-level exposures to chemicals and behavioral developmental dysfunctions, is often considered still not to be established. The pertinent studies on neurobehavioral developmental toxicity of individual substances (lead, cadmium, organic solvents, PCBs, alcohol, nicotine, diazepam) are reviewed, and the methodologies and conclusions, the missing aspects and the existing problems which still need to be solved in further studies, are discussed. In addition, the necessity of undertaking a broad prospective cohort study on multifactorial influences on the behavioral development of children is emphasized.", 
    "81": "The effects of a pure benzodiazepine antagonist (Flumazenil) on the responses R1 and R2 of the blink reflex, psychomotor tests, and Event Related Potentials (ERP), in six healthy volunteers sedated with Midazolam have been compared. Measurements were made during each of four successive phases. Phase 0 corresponded to control recordings. Midazolam was administered rapidly during phase 1 and slowly during phase 2. Phase 3 corresponded to spontaneous waking once the administration of Midazolam had been stopped. Flumazenil was administered during phase 2. As the subjects fell asleep, R1 and R2 were the last parameters to disappear. Under the influence of Flumazenil, R1 was the first to reappear, while R2 did not recur until complete waking, and the other tests were unpracticable. During phase 3, R1 reappeared before R2 once more, the psychomotor test responses and ERP returning only later. The modifications of both R1 and R2 of the blink reflex are a good criterion of the presence of BZD in a toxic coma and a good test to indicate the depth of a coma or a sedation with BZD, whilst ERP, since they require the cooperation of the patient, are a test of vigilance and not of awakening.", 
    "82": "Experience with organ procurement from poisoned donors in brain death status is still limited in comparison with other etiologies. From 1963 to 1993, 2769 grafts (heart 141, kidney 1922, liver 623, pancreas 43) were performed in our University Hospital. Since 1975, among 1174 patients admitted to the ICU for acute poisoning, 12 patients who developed brain death status were considered for organ donation. The toxics involved were: methaqualone (1), benzodiazepines (1), benzodiazepines plus tricyclic antidepressants (2), barbiturates (2), insulin (2), carbon monoxide (1), cyanide (1), methanol (1), and acetaminophen (1). Exclusion criteria for organ removal were applied according to the nature of the toxin and the general criteria used for organ donation. The organs removed were: heart 5, heart valves for graft bank 2, kidneys 22, liver 4, pancreas 2, pancrease islet cells 2. Pertinent follow-up was obtained in 23 of 32 recipients. Immediate outcome was favorable in 20/23 patients (85%). Three patients died either from stroke, heart failure or preexisting encephalopathy. Two patients died from either chronic hepatic or renal graft rejection. None of these events could be directly related to a toxic origin. The one year survival rate of 75% is similar to that observed in the population who received organs from nonpoisoned donors. Organ procurement can be considered in few selected cases of acute poisoning. The accuracy of the diagnosis of irreversible brain damage is essential in this setting.", 
    "83": "For many physicians an antidote is an antidote. According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety definition, an antidote is a therapeutic substance used to counteract the toxic action(s) of a specified xenobiotic. Given this wide definition, the efficacy of an antidote may vary considerably depending on which toxic action(s) being counteracted and the level of counteracting power. An almost 100% efficacy is seen using specific antagonists, such as naloxone in opiate poisoning or flumazenil in benzodiazepine poisoning, e.g. resulting in complete reversal of opiate toxicity unless complications, such as anoxic brain damage, have developed. At the other end of the efficacy scale, we may place chelating agents for heavy metal poisoning and diazepam for organophosphorus insecticide poisoning which are considered only to be an adjuncts to supportive care. When teaching clinical toxicology or recommending the use of antidotes in poisoned patients, the expected efficacy level of the antidote in question should be stressed. This may be particularly important in severe poisoning when the antidote may only be considered as an important adjunct to supportive care, e.g. deferoxamine in acute iron poisoning. Unless this is stressed, the unexperienced physician may rely too much on the antidote and pay insufficient attention to the supportive care. The varying efficacy levels will be discussed based on the presently ongoing International Programme on Chemical Safety/Commission of the European Communities evaluation program on antidotes.", 
    "84": "To control benzodiazepine abuse in Hong Kong, the Government's Pharmacy and Poisons Board reclassified benzodiazepines as Dangerous Drugs in October 1990. Apart from formal prescriptions, detailed records were then required for the supply and dispensing of these drugs. These regulations were applied initially only to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam, and were extended in January 1992 to include all benzodiazepines. The impact of these regulatory changes on benzodiazepine use has been studied by analyzing the sales patterns of seven benzodiazepines between 1990-1993. In 1991, the sales of flunitrazepam and triazolam fell, but the sales of five unrestricted benzodiazepines increased. In 1992-1993, the sales of all but one of the benzodiazepines fell. Comparing 1993 to 1990, the fall in sales was particularly marked for triazolam, chlordiazepoxide and flunitrazepam. A regulation requiring the use of proper prescriptions and detailed records for the supply and dispensing of benzodiazepines, appears to have curbed, at least partially, their abuse in Hong Kong.", 
    "85": "Our institute serves as a centralized clinical laboratory for municipal and private hospitals in Taipei, a major international metropolis in the Asian region. Two key considerations leading to the development of our toxicology program are: a large number of foreign visitors and local residents returning from overseas trips may bring in chemicals which are less commonly seen in this region; and the lack of readily available assays for a large percentage of commonly used medicines, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Our toxicology screening program addresses the needs of both the Emergency Department Drug Screening and Drug of Abuse Screening. In Emergency Department Drug Screening, REMEDi HS is used as the general screening method. In Drug of Abuse Screening, the TDx is used for the initial screening of amphetamine-like substances and opiates, followed by REMEDi HS for the confirmation of positive samples. Emergency Department data collected at our institute over one year (September 1992 to August 1993) identified 57 different drugs in 713 samples. Opiates, narcotics and central stimulants accounted for 24% of the encountered drugs. Presently, there is no extensive reporting of misuse of benzodiazepines in this region. The detection of herbal ingredients like ephedrine and methylephedrine (from the Ma-Huang plant) in patient samples illustrates a large area often overlooked by western toxicology.", 
    "86": "A Phase 1 clinical study of 123I-iomazenil (IMZ), a new radiopharmaceutical developed for evaluation of central-type benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) with SPECT, was performed to examine its safety and biodistribution in six healthy volunteers. The brain uptake of 123I-IMZ reached a maximum value of 11.7 +/- 1.6% of the injected dose at 10-20 min after i.v. administration, and then decreased slowly. The regional tracer distribution immediately after injection (0-10 min) was considered to be a reflection of the cerebral blood flow. From 2 to 3 hours post-injection, washout of the radioactivity from the deep gray matter was observed, resulting in the distribution reflecting the reported distribution of BZR. No significant accumulation was seen in any organ other than the brain. The estimated absorbed dose of 123I-IMZ calculated by the MIRD method was comparable to that of 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormal clinical laboratory findings due to the drug administration were observed. These results suggest that 123I-IMZ is a safe and promising agent for evaluating the function of central-type BZR.",

Gastrin content was 30.1 +/- 2.9 pmol per well and basal gastrin release was 900 +/- 27 fmol per well (n = 45). Carbachol (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) dose-dependently stimulated gastrin release with a maximal stimulatory response achieved at a concentration of 10(-5) M (330% over basal). To characterize the muscarinic receptor which mediates gastrin release from antral G cells, we examined the effect of three muscarinic receptor antagonists on carbachol-stimulated gastrin release; atropine (nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist), pirenzepine (M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist) and 4-DAMP (M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist). Atropine (10(-9) to 10(-6) M), pirenzepine (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) and 4-DAMP (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) had no effect on the basal gastrin release. However, carbachol (10(-5) M)-stimulated gastrin release was effectively inhibited by atropine and 4-DAMP with Ki values of 0.48 and 0.66 nM, respectively. Pirenzepine at a high concentration (10(-5) M) also inhibited carbachol-stimulated gastrin release with a Ki value of 46.3 nM. These results suggest that the cholinergic nervous system directly stimulates gastrin release via M3 muscarinic receptors located on antral G cells."
