Drug regimens are often predetermined and unrelated to the extent and duration of dependence, recent consumption, or previous withdrawal symptoms. Diazepam loading shortens the detoxification period and avoids the indiscriminate use of medication. It has been shown to be effective as an in-patient treatment. This paper examines the feasibility of introducing diazepam loading in a community setting, and discusses the implications that this would have for clinical practice.", 
    "1": "A rapid, selective and sensitive method for determination of oxazepam in plasma is described, based on reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The separation was performed on an analytical 300 x 3.9 mm i.d m-bondapack C18 column using UV detector at 230 nm. A mixture of methanol-phosphate buffer (50:50 v/v) adjusted to pH 6 at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min-1 was used as mobile phase. The proteins were precipitated with a 24% perchloric acid (HClO4) solution and analytical recovery was complete. Diazepam was used as an internal standard. The standard curve was linear over the range 100-1600 ng mL-1 and the detection limit for oxazepam was 30 ngmL-1. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were found to be less than 10%. This method is simple, rapid and sensitive enough for monitoring of oxazepam levels in clinical studies and pharmacokinetic aspects.", 
    "2": "The aim of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of acute and steady state doses of loprazolam (1 mg) following nighttime administration in 12 young (18-30 years) and 12 elderly (60-80 years) nonfasting subjects. Loprazolam blood plasma concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorption detection. The drug was isolated from the plasma using a solid phase extraction procedure. On day 1 subjects were breathalyzer and given a brief medical examination. Baseline blood samples (10 ml) were taken via a venous cannula at -1.5 to -0.25 h prior to drug administration. Loprazolam was administered at 21.00 and further blood samples were taken at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 23.5 h (baseline sample for day 2). On subsequent days (days 2, 3 and 4) blood samples were taken at -0.5 and 2 h. The schedule for day 1 was repeated for day 5 with the test period ending at 21.30 on day 6. Significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of the drug were evident in the elderly volunteers compared with the young volunteers following steady state, where tmax was significantly prolonged (CI 90% = 0.80 to 1.25; p < 0.00006) and a decline was observed in peak plasma concentration (CI 90% = 0.80 to 1.25; p < 0.00006). However, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in either the elimination half-life of the drug or the area under the curve. Loprazolam appears to be well tolerated by both the young and the elderly and only mild adverse effects were reported after nighttime administration. These results provide valuable data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in normal clinical practice.",

    "5": "Male Wistar rats were deprived of water for 18-24 h before the experiments and were allowed to drink for 20 s periods during the experimental session. During these periods water intake was accompanied by steady arterial pressure increases. This pressor response was unaffected by topical anesthesia of the oral cavity. Direct administration of water into the stomach did not cause pressor responses. The pressor response was not affected by bilateral adrenal demedullation or by pretreatment with diazepam, homatropine methyl bromide, d(CH2)5 Tyr(Me)AVP, losartan or RX821002. The pressor response was significantly reduced by ganglionic blockade with mecamylamine or pretreatment with the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin.",

    "7": "The effects of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist quisqualate (QUIS) and selective AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 1-(aminophenyl)-methyl-7, 8-methyilendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) on the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the hippocampus and striatum of freely moving rats were studied by transversal microdialysis. Acetylcholine level in the dialisate was measured by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with an electrochemical detector. The QUIS (100 microM) perfused through the striatum induced an increase of extracellular ACh level (250%) which lasted for over 1h and gradually returned to basal values. Local perfusion of GYKI 52466 (10-100 microM) to the striatum did not change the basal release of ACh. GYKI 52466 (10 microM) administered together with QUIS (100 microM) in he striatum antagonized the stimulant effect of QUIS on the ACh release. Local administration of the QUIS (100 microM) through the microdialysis fiber implanted in the hippocampus, caused a long lasting increase of extracellular hippocampal ACh level (360%) which was reversed when the drug was withdrawn from the perfusion solution. The stimulant effect of QUIS was antagonized by concomitant perfusion of GYKI (10 microM). No effect was seen on the basal ACh release when GYKI (10-100 microM) was perfused through the hippocampus. Local perfusion with tetrodotoxin (1 microM) decrease the basal release of ACh and prevented the QUIS-induced increase of ACh both in the hippocampus and striatum. Our in vivo neurochemical results indicate that hippocampal and striatal cholinergic systems are regulated by non-NMDA (probably AMPA) glutamatergic receptors located in the hippocampus and striatum.", 
    "8": "The stress-induced hyperthermia test is a paradigm developed several years ago to model the expression of autonomic hyperactivity in anxiety. Whereas in the classical stress-induced hyperthermia, cohort removal was used, in a recently described modification of the stress-induced hyperthermia model singly housed mice rather than groups of mice were used. The modification of this model can be summarized as follows: rectal temperature is recorded in singly housed animals at two consecutive time-points (T1 and T2) which are interspaced by a defined time-interval (15 min). Since the value at the second temperature-recording exceeds the value of the initial measure it is the difference between these two core-temperatures which reflects stress-induced hyperthermia. In the present study, the stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm, in its modified design, was evaluated in OF1/IC mice. By comparing the effect of various compounds in both the modified as well as the classical (cohort removal) stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm, a very high correlation was found for the pharmacological sensitivity of the two paradigms. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that other anxiolytics, all known to be active in the classical stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm, such as the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide (0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, p.o.), diazepam (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg, p.o.), clobazam (5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) and oxazepam (5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) as well as the non-benzodiazepines buspirone (7.5 or 15 mg/kg, p.o.) and ethanol (15% or 30%, 10 ml/kg, p.o.), showed a marked reduction in stress-induced hyperthermia in the modified design. New candidate anxiolytics, i.e. the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor group 2 agonist LY314582 (1 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.; racemic mixture of LY354740 ((2S,4S)-2-amino-4-(4,4-diphenylbut-1-yl)-pentane-1,5-dioic acid), the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor antagonist MPEP (1, 7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg, p.o.; 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine) and the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist NKP608 (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg, p.o.; quinoline-4-carboxylic acid [trans-(2R,4S)-1-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzoyl)-2-(4-chloro-benzyl)-piperidin-4-yl]-amide) also reduced stress-induced hyperthermia in the modified paradigm clearly indicating anxiolytic-like activity for these compounds. Finally, the effects of the classical benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, p.o.), in parallel with its effect on stress-induced hyperthermia, were also investigated for its effect on plasma concentrations of the two stress hormones, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone. It was shown that all three parameters were significantly increased 15 min after T1 in vehicle-treated mice whereas the increase was significantly attenuated following pre-treatment with chlordiazepoxide. In conclusion, all the data presented here indicate that the modified version of the stress-induced hyperthermia-paradigm is a valid and interesting alternative to the classical stress-induced hyperthermia test.", 
    "9": "Chemotransduction of arterial hypoxemia by the cat carotid body is generally thought to begin with a hypoxia-induced depolarization of the glomus cells (GCs) of the carotid body (CB). This depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels with the subsequent entry of calcium, movement of transmitter-containing vesicles to the synaptic-like juncture between the GC and apposed sensory afferent neuron. The vesicles exocytotically release their transmitters which then proceed to the receptors on both the postsynaptic neuron and on the GCs themselves (autoreceptors). Action potentials and their modulation in the sensory fibers are the result, along with the modulation of further neurotransmitter release from the GCs. The purpose of the present study was to: (1) determine the parameters of an incubated cat CB preparation capable of releasing measurable amounts of catecholamines (CAs) in response to hypoxia; (2) determine the impact of muscarinic activities on CA release during the hypoxic challenge; (3) determine if the muscarinic activity preferentially modified the release of one CA more than another; (4) determine if there were any differences in the pattern of hypoxia-induced release of dopamine (DA) vs. norepinephrine (NE). CBs were harvested from deeply anesthetized cats. Cleaned of fat and connective tissue, they were incubated in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate solution at 37 degrees C, and bubbled with a hyperoxic mixture of gases (95% O(2)-5% CO(2)) for 30 min. The first series of experiments to address the CB's hypoxia-induced release of CAs explored the effects of incubating CBs for 2 h with hyperoxia vs. normoxia (21% O(2)-6% CO(2)) followed by a 30 min hypoxic challenge, with or without L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). In the second series of experiments the CBs, after the first 30 min of hyperoxia, were next challenged with hypoxia (4% O(2)-5% CO(2)) for intervals of 3-20 min with intervening recovery periods of hyperoxia to determine the effect of the duration of the hypoxic exposure on CA release. In the third series of experiments the CBs, after the first 30 min of hyperoxia, were challenged with hypoxia for intervals of 10-40 min in the presence or absence of an M1 or M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist. CAs released into the incubation medium were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection using standard procedures. Incubated cat CBs challenged for 2 h with hyperoxia followed by 30 min of hypoxia, released much more measurable amounts of CAs in the presence of 40 microM L-DOPA than without it. Moving from hyperoxia to hypoxia produced a better yield than moving from normoxia to hypoxia, and at least 10-20 min exposures were needed for measurable amounts of CAs. The M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, reduced the hypoxia-induced release of CAs during each exposure. Further, the reduction appeared to be dose-related. The M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist, methoctramine, enhanced the hypoxia-induced release of CAs during each exposure. These data support a role for acetylcholine (ACh) in the hypoxia-induced release of CAs, and suggest a significant, if modest, muscarinic dimension to it. And although hypoxia induced a greater release of DA than of NE, the muscarinic modulation of the release (both decreasing it and increasing it) may have had a greater impact on NE release than on DA release. Finally, the patterns of hypoxia-induced release of DA and NE from incubated cat carotid bodies are significantly different.", 
    "10": "The object of this study was to investigate the influence of midazolam on the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine in rabbits. Lidocaine levels were determined by the immunofluorescence polarization method, using Abbott reagents. After intravenous administration of a combined dose of midazolam (0.2 mg kg(-1)i.v.) with lidocaine (1 mg kg(-1)i.v.) a statistically perceivable decrease of lidocaine concentration, together with an increase of the constant rate of its elimination and reduction of the biological half-life with average time of lidocaine remaining in the system were observed. Midazolam administered intravenously together with lidocaine shortens the residence time of the drug.", 
    "11": "The study included 61 patients (35 men and 26 women) ages 47 to 74 in whom a primary liver cancer was diagnosed or neoplastic metastases to the liver were confirmed in the course of a cancer of the stomach or the large bowel. In each patient the endogenous serum diazepam concentration (ESDC) was estimated chromatographically and the results obtained were compared to selected clinical traits such as the magnitude and number of neoplastic changes and their location in the liver parenchyma, the histological form of the tumor and the primary location of the cancer in the case of neoplasms of the alimentary canal. The determination of the ESDC was also carried out in a control group made up of voluntary blood donors. Neither group examined received any medication belonging to the benzodiazepine group. From the results of the tests conducted it was confirmed that the average ESDC of patients with liver neoplasms was 65 times higher than that of the control group. Simultaneously, however, in patients with a primary liver cancer the average endogenous concentration was higher than in patients with neoplastic metastases to that organ and this was statistically significant. The location in the hepatic parenchyma of the neoplastic change as well as the primary location of the cancer remained without a statistically significant influence in the changes of ESDC. It was moreover shown that significantly high ESDC were associated in the liver mainly with increased neoplastic growth (above 3 cm in diameter) and with multiple spread (5 focuses and more).", 
    "12": "There exist a large number of drugs belonging to the benzodiazepine family. These include the 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam, temazepam and oxazepam, the often more potent diazolo- and triazolo-groups represented by alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam etc. These drugs represent a large range of potencies from submilligram doses to over 100 mg and a range of polarities. Consequently, blood or plasma concentrations associated with prescribed use range from sub-nanogram per mL to near-microgram per mL. Their medical use varies, but they are predominantly used as hypnotics and sedatives. Some members are also used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress and obsessive-compulsive disorders, alcohol withdrawal, muscle spasm, and seizures. Recreationally, drug users favor these drugs to reduce the symptoms of withdrawal and unpleasant effects of heroin and cocaine. They are also commonly used as \"date-rape\" drugs to render a victim incapable of resisting an attack. Benzodiazepines elicit a large number of physiological and psychological responses in humans that often can lead to significant behavioral changes and adverse effects on skills required for safe driving. These include reduced lane control, increased reaction times, reduced hand-eye coordination and cognitive impairment. Impairment can exceed that seen with 0.05 g% ethanol. In high doses benzodiazepines can cause persons to exhibit classical features of CNS-depressant drugs such as nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, and impaired divided attention skills. As one would expect with hypnotics and sedatives, any sleep deprivation, or situations involving monotonous driving can lead to a reduced ability to concentrate and maintain vigilance. Adverse effects on REM and NREM sleep patterns will exacerbate fatigue-related components to driving. Persons with sleep abnormalities, e.g., sleep apnea, may be more likely to be affected by benzodiazepines than those with normal sleep patterns. Ethanol and narcotic analgesics also affect sleep patterns and may compound any CNS-depressant effects associated with the use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "13": "We report a case of successful treatment of propylene glycol toxicity by discontinuation of propylene glycol administration and hemodialysis therapy. A critically ill woman receiving high dose intravenous lorazepam therapy is described. Although propylene glycol toxicity often resolves promptly after discontinuation of the causative parenteral source, renal or liver dysfunction may prolong the sequelae of propylene glycol infusion. Hemodialysis efficiently lowers propylene glycol serum concentrations in a manner analogous to extracorporeal therapy for other small molecular weight alcohol intoxications. Therefore, hemodialysis may be a useful component of therapy for critically ill patients exhibiting propylene glycol toxicity in the context of multiple organ dysfunction.", 
    "14": "Traditional methods of assessing ventilatory effects of sedative agents do not measure their propensity to cause upper airway obstruction (UAO).

    "15": "A state of deep sedation (defined as an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score of 3 and a bispectral index < 80) was attained in 10 healthy volunteers, aged 19-41, using midazolam. Volunteers breathed through a chamber connected to a regulated source of negative pressure that was gradually adjusted downward to produce UAO based on maximal inspiratory flow. The study consisted of three phases: A control phase while awake, a study phase during midazolam deep sedation, and a recovery phase after flumazenil administration.", 
    "16": "During the control phase no subject demonstrated airway obstruction at negative pressures to -30-cm H2O. All subjects exhibited complete UAO during DNAP episodes while sedated. Negative pressures required to cause complete UAO (Pcrit) ranged from -2 to -14 cm H2O. After administration of flumazenil, all subjects attained full consciousness within 5 min and did not demonstrate UAO at negative pressures to -30-cm H2O.", 
    "17": "Dynamic Negative Airway Pressure is a useful method for provoking midazolam-induced UAO, and may potentially be used to compare the potential for different sedatives and patient factors to cause UAO. Flumazenil was completely effective in reversing the potential for midazolam to cause UAO.", 
    "18": "Sixty male subjects with self-reported high, moderate, and low aggressive dispositions were given the opportunity to aggress, by administering electric shocks, against an increasingly provocative fictitious opponent within the context of a competitive reaction time task. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) 10 mg of diazepam or (2) placebo. Results indicated that diazepam-intoxicated subjects aggressed by selecting the highest shock setting (10) more frequently than did nonintoxicated subjects. High hostile subjects were also more influenced by the aggression-enhancing effects of diazepam than moderate and low hostile subjects. Benzodiazepine-facilitated aggression is discussed in the context of individual differences and the importance for physicians to assess a patient's disposition prior to prescribing such medication.", 
    "19": "The National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS) is a longitudinal, multisite, prospective cohort study that assesses changes in illicit drug use and other problems after treatment in national (UK) drug misuse treatment programmes. Clients were recruited from 54 residential and community-based drug treatment programmes throughout England. Four modalities were studied: inpatient drug dependence units, residential/rehabilitation programmes, methadone maintenance, and methadone reduction programmes. Data on substance use behaviours and physical and psychological health were collected by structured face-to-face interviews at intake, 1- and 2-year follow-up. Data are presented for 549 clients. A majority of clients achieved widespread improvements across a range of outcome measures after treatment in existing treatment services. For most outcomes, reductions in problem behaviours at the group level occurred within the first year and were maintained at 2 years. Considerable stability of outcomes at the individual level was also found. Abstinence from illicit drugs was substantially increased among clients from both residential and community programmes, and there were also substantial reductions in frequency of use of heroin, nonprescribed methadone, benzodiazepines, and crack cocaine. Injecting and shared use of injecting equipment was also reduced. Heavy drinking was common at intake and was not reduced at follow-up. Psychological and physical health problems were reduced on both groups at follow-up. These changes represent important clinical benefits to the individual clients, to their families, and to society.",

Fifteen animals served as untreated controls. One hour before sacrifice tritiated thymidine was injected intraperitoneally. Plasma was collected for determination of CCK and the pancreas, liver, common bile duct and gallbladder were excised. The pancreas and liver were weighed and processed for the contents of protein, DNA and water. Tissue specimens were taken for autoradiography.", 
    "23": "The concentration of CCK in plasma increased fourfold during the infusion of CCK-8S. The pancreas and, to a lesser extent, the liver increased in weight, DNA and protein contents after infusion of CCK-8S, whereas the pancreas, but not the liver, decreased in weight and protein content after infusion of devazepide. Pancreatic amylase content was increased after CCK-8S treatment, but unaffected by devazepide. Labelling index of pancreatic acinar cells, hepatocytes and gallbladder epithelium was no different from that of controls after four weeks of infusion of CCK-8S or devazepide. A correlation was found between the concentration of plasma CCK on one hand and the weights and DNA contents in pancreas and liver on the other.",

The tricyclic antidepressants also have significant effect on the heart rate, blood pressure as well as having the propensity to cause prolonged QTc, whereas the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally safe. Among the mood stabilizers, lithium and carbamazepine have been associated with sinus node arrhythmias while sodium valproate is relatively free of any untoward cardiac effect. The benzodiazepines are in general safe even in patients with myocardial infarction and coronary bypass.",

Semi-rapid application of KA evoked non-desensitizing responses with EC(50) values of 82 microM for cortical and 67 microM for spinal cord neurones. In the presence of concanavalin A, GYKI 53655 (100 microM) reduced responses of both types of neurone to KA by about 80% to leave a KA receptor-mediated response with an EC(50) of 4 microM on spinal cord neurones and 27 microM (P<0.001) on cortical neurones. Ultra-fast application of KA to outside-out patches of cortical neurones evoked a non-decaying response which was reduced by about 30% by GYKI 53655 to reveal a transient response that desensitized by 92.5% with a time constant (tau(des)) of 26.2 ms. Responses of spinal cord patches decayed by 47.8%. GYKI 53655 reduced the peak response by 8.3% and the residual response desensitized by 75.8%, with a tau(des) of 17.3 ms, all values being significantly smaller than for cortical neurones. Single-cell RT-PCR showed relative abundances of mRNAs for the KA receptors, GluR5, GluR6 and GluR7, of 12, 33 and 54% for cortical neurones and 38, 10 and 54% for spinal cord neurones, respectively. The relative abundances of KA1 and KA2 were 12 and 88% for cortical neurones, and 19 and 79% for spinal cord neurones, respectively.

The use of high-resolution phosphorimaging has allowed both the affinity (K(d)) and density (B(max)) of [(3)H]flumazenil binding to be measured within regions of the hippocampal formation as well as the cerebellum and frontal cortex. The Scatchard plots of data from all brain regions were linear with Hill coefficients close to unity consistent with the presence of a single binding site for [(3)H]flumazenil. The affinities of [(3)H]flumazenil binding within all the brain regions were similar (K(d) 1.57+/-0.20-3.08+/-0.01 nM), while the density of [(3)H]flumazenil binding varied significantly between the brain regions analysed (B(max) 182.7+/-7.3-596.7+/-34.0 fmol/mg ETE; P<0.0001).

Based on these observations in the hippocampus, a series of quantitative receptor autoradiographic studies were undertaken to determine the density and distribution of eight types of neurotransmitter receptors from four neurotransmitter systems (GABAergic, serotoninergic [5-HT], cholinergic, and glutamatergic). Data from these single concentration ligand binding studies indicate that the GABAergic receptor system (3[H]-flunitrazepam labeled benzodiazepine binding sites and 3[H]-muscimol labeled GABA(A) receptors) is significantly reduced in high binding regions, marking for the first time an abnormality in the GABA system in autism. In contrast, the density and distribution of the other six receptors studied (3[H]-80H-DPAT labeled 5-HT1A receptors, 3[H]-ketanserin labeled 5-HT2 receptors, 3[H]-pirenzepine labled M1 receptors, 3[H]-hemicholinium labeled high affinity choline uptake sites, 3[H]-MK801 labeled NMDA receptors, and 3[H]-kainate labeled kainate receptors) in the hippocampus did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in binding.", 
    "41": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with rapid onset, short duration of action and minimal side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oral administration of midazolam as pre-operative sedation in the dental treatment of uncooperative pediatric patients. Included in the study were 160 children with a mean age of 6.7 +/- 2.6 years (1-14 years), 83 boys and 77 girls. All the patients had been referred for specialist treatment due to behavioral management problems. Treatment was performed in 250 sessions. All the children received an oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight of midazolam. Acceptance of treatment was evaluated according to Rud & Kisling. Local anesthesia followed by restorative treatment and/or extractions constituted more than 90% of the performed treatments. Of the 250 sessions, 63% were performed with total acceptance and 30% with doubtful acceptance. In 7%, no treatment could be performed. No serious complications were registered during or after treatment. All the children were able to leave the clinic one hour after treatment. In conclusion, we consider oral administration of midazolam a safe form of premedication. The route of administration, the short waiting-time and half-life, in combination with a level of sedation that allows treatment to be performed, are the principal advantages of conscious sedation with orally administered midazolam.", 
    "42": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of rectal midazolam on uncooperative children. The trial included 120 children at the age of 16 months to 10 years and six months (X = 4.5 years). The children were referred because behavioural management techniques alone had failed. On 225 treatment occasions the children received midazolam, 0.3 mg/kg body weight rectally 10 mins before treatment. The degree of sedation was assessed by the dentists after 10, 15, 20, 45 and 60 minutes. 60% of the treatments were fulfilled without difficulty. 39.6% of the treatments could be performed with some difficulty and with the help of parents preventive holding. Only one mentally handicapped patient showed non-acceptance. No side effects were noted during the treatments. After 107 treatments the parents were asked about the total time their children seemed sedated. After two hours 86 children were still considered sedated but after three hours only four of them seemed effected by the drug. Midazolam has shown in this follow-up to be an effective and safe drug for premedication of infants in the stressed dental situation. The advantage to for example diazepam lies mainly in the shorter period of time of sedation.", 
    "43": "Cytokines produced by immune system cells infiltrating pancreatic islets are candidate mediators of islet beta-cell destruction in autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. After 72 h exposure of human pancreatic islets to a cytotoxic cytokine combination of interleukin 1 beta (50 U/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (1,000 U/ml), and interferon gamma (1,000 U/ml), an increase of cell death vs. control islets was demonstrated by TUNEL and cell death detection ELISA method. Islet death was associated with apoptosis and mitochondrial swelling as evidenced by electron microscopy. This effect was correlated with a marked decrease of Bcl-2 mRNA expression (without any major change of Bax mRNA) and a marked increase of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA. Since peripheral benzodiazepine receptors constitute the aspecific mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and that it has been suggested to be involved in cytokine-induced cell death, we evaluated the effects of the cytotoxic cytokines on PBR density and mRNA expression. We demonstrated that cytokine treatment of human islets induced an increase of maximum density of (3)H1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-1-methylpropyl)-3- isoquinolinecarboxamide binding sites, (5,110+/-193 vs. 3,421+/-336 fmol/mg proteins, P<0.05) with no significant change in the affinity constant value (9.45+/-0.869 vs. 8.7+/-1.159 nM). Moreover, an increase of the expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor mRNA was observed, suggesting an increased transcription from the coding gene. These results suggest a possible role of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in the organism response to tissue damage associated with inflammatory mediator production.",

    "50": "Type II pneumocytes synthesize surfactant and differentiate into type I pneumocytes to maintain the epithelium (1). Alveolar type II cell proliferation is required for reepithelization after acute lung injury (ALI) and is thought to minimize the subsequent fibrotic response (1). Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are among the most potent mitogen for type II epithelial cells, but not for fibroblasts in the lung (1). These growth factors attenuate several experimental ALI models by promoting epithelial repair (2,3). Thus, KGF and HGF may be a promising therapeutic approach to ALI. Critically ill patients with ALI often receive IV anesthetics or sedatives to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, these patients sometimes undergo bronchoscopy under local anesthesia to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or to remove respiratory secretions. Several IV and local anesthetics inhibit proliferation of various cells including epithelium (4,5). If these anesthetics impede proliferation of type II pneumocytes, this suppressive effect may be a disadvantage for alveolar reepithelization in the course of recovery from ALI. In this study, we examined the effects of midazolam, propofol, ketamine, thiopental, and lidocaine on proliferation of type II alveolar epithelial cells using in vitro culture system. Because fibroblast proliferation is a key event in late phase of ALI, inhibition of this fibroproliferation is probably beneficial. Thus, we further determined whether these anesthetics could regulate proliferation of lung fibroblasts. In the current study, rolipram was used as a positive control. In our previous preliminary experiment, we found that rolipram, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor type IV, augments spontaneous or KGF-/HGF-promoted type II cell proliferation (6).",

    "52": "Postoperative delirium is a common problem associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, additional tests and consultations and therefore, increased cost (1,2). The reported incidence of delirium or confusion after surgery ranges from 8% to 78% (2,3-5), depending on methods and population studied. The elderly seem to be at significantly increased risk for this complication. Sleep-wake cycle disruption has been associated with delirium and behavioral changes (5) and sleep deprivation can even result in psychosis (6). Environmental changes (i.e., hospital stay), medications, and general anesthesia can affect the sleep-wake cycle (3,4). Plasma melatonin levels, which play an important role in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, are decreased after surgery (18) and in hospitalized patients (7,11). We report the successful use of melatonin in treating severe postoperative delirium unresponsive to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines in one patient. In another patient with a history of postoperative delirium, melatonin was used to prevent another episode of delirium after repeat lower extremity surgery.",

    "54": "The effect of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli, LPS) on cellular metabolism and drug biotransformation was studied in precision-cut rat liver slices (PCLS). Xenobiotic metabolism by PCLS was assessed by measuring phase I (midazolam hydroxylation) and phase II (paracetamol conjugates) enzyme activities. Nitrites formation was used as an indirect way to assess LPS-mediated activation of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, type 2). PCLS incubation with various LPS doses results in a dose-dependent formation of nitrites. Such a nitrite formation is decreased by dexamethasone. After incubation of PCLS for 24 h LPS addition did not increase the basal nitrite formation, indicating that cells are not responsive any more. Paracetamol conjugation was unaffected by LPS treatment but midazolam hydroxylation was reduced by more than 50%. Such a loss is not due to cell impairment since neither survival (LDH leakage) nor cellular metabolism (protein synthesis or ATP content) were modified by LPS. Indeed, under defined conditions, namely Williams' medium E and O(2)/CO(2) (95:5), PCLS maintained both ATP and GSH levels and the capacity of hepatocytes to synthesize proteins. In conclusion, the in vitro model of PCLS reproduces the inhibitory effect of LPS on a CYP3A-dependent activity, allowing a mechanistic approach to study cell-cell interactions.", 
    "55": "The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency to consider the cumulative effects of exposure to pesticides having a 'common mechanism of toxicity.' This paper reviews the information available on the acute neurotoxicity and mechanisms of toxic action of pyrethroid insecticides in mammals from the perspective of the 'common mechanism' statute of the FQPA. The principal effects of pyrethroids as a class are various signs of excitatory neurotoxicity. Historically, pyrethroids were grouped into two subclasses (Types I and II) based on chemical structure and the production of either the T (tremor) or CS (choreoathetosis with salivation) intoxication syndrome following intravenous or intracerebral administration to rodents. Although this classification system is widely employed, it has several shortcomings for the identification of common toxic effects. In particular, it does not reflect the diversity of intoxication signs found following oral administration of various pyrethroids. Pyrethroids act in vitro on a variety of putative biochemical and physiological target sites, four of which merit consideration as sites of toxic action. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels, the sites of insecticidal action, are also important target sites in mammals. Unlike insects, mammals have multiple sodium channel isoforms that vary in their biophysical and pharmacological properties, including their differential sensitivity to pyrethroids. Pyrethroids also act on some isoforms of voltage-sensitive calcium and chloride channels, and these effects may contribute to the toxicity of some compounds. Effects on peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are unlikely to be a principal cause of pyrethroid intoxication but may contribute to or enhance convulsions caused by actions at other target sites. In contrast, other putative target sites that have been identified in vitro do not appear to play a major role in pyrethroid intoxication. The diverse toxic actions and pharmacological effects of pyrethroids suggest that simple additivity models based on combined actions at a single target are not appropriate to assess the risks of cumulative exposure to multiple pyrethroids.", 
    "56": "The anticonvulsive potential of classical antiepileptics co-administered with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists against generalized tonic-clonic seizures was evaluated in the model of maximal electroshock (MES)-induced convulsions. Propranolol, acebutolol, metoprolol and atenolol were tested in the doses not affecting the electroconvulsive threshold. Propranolol and metoprolol lowered the ED(50) of valproate and diazepam. Acebutolol reduced valproate's but not diazepam's ED(50) value. In contrast, hydrophilic atenolol, not penetrating via blood-brain barrier, affected neither the action of valproate nor diazepam. None of the studied drugs changed the protective activity of carbamazepine and phenytoin against MES. beta-blockers per se did not alter the motor performance of mice. Moreover, propranolol and metoprolol did not influence diazepam-evoked impairment of locomotor activity. The free plasma and brain levels of antiepileptic drugs were not affected by beta-blockers. In conclusion, the use of certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as propranolol and metoprolol, might improve the antiepileptic potential of valproate and diazepam.", 
    "57": "The abused volatile solvent 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE) shares many acute behavioral effects with central nervous system (CNS) depressants; however, demonstration of tolerance to these effects has been difficult. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the development of TCE-induced changes in locomotor activity in mice following repeated injections with diazepam. In the initial concentration-effect curve determinations, diazepam decreased locomotor activity at all doses tested and TCE produced a biphasic effect, increasing locomotor activity at lower concentrations with return to control levels at a high (16,000 ppm) concentration. Flurothyl, a vapor with convulsive properties, had no pronounced effects on locomotor activity at subconvulsant concentrations. Following four daily injections with vehicle or with 10 mg/kg/day diazepam, mice were administered the same concentration of drug/inhalant that they received initially and were retested for locomotor activity effects. Concentration-effect curves for diazepam and flurothyl were not altered by this modest regimen of repeated dosing with diazepam. In contrast, sensitization to the locomotor-stimulating effects of TCE was observed in diazepam-treated mice, but not in vehicle-treated mice. These results suggest that the development of sensitization to TCE involves common mechanisms with those that are affected by repeated dosing with the CNS depressant diazepam.", 
    "58": "Selective dopamine D(2) antogonists increase meal size and decrease the rate of feeding within a meal. Three experiments investigated the extent to which the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, and the prototypical antipsychotic, haloperidol, affected meal size and feeding rate. Microstructural analyses of meal patterning were made over a range of drug doses administered to free feeding male Lister hooded rats. Haloperidol and clozapine produced a short-term increase in food intake. Haloperidol (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) enhanced meal size (maximal at 0.1 mg/kg) and reduced feeding rate (monotonic decrease with increasing dose). Neither clozapine (1-10 mg/kg) nor olanzapine (0.3-3 mg/kg) enhanced meal size, although both drugs produced similar reductions in feeding rate to haloperidol. These data suggest that enhancement of meal size may be correlated with a high level of extrapyramidal side effects in an antipsychotic drug. The absence of an increase in meal size by two atypical compounds suggests that the increase in body weight associated with clinical treatment with these drugs cannot be modelled by acute stimulation of meal size in the rat.",

    "65": "A review is presented on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies on cholecystokinin antagonists. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a gastrointestinal peptide hormone closely related chemically to gastrin. However, its receptors are found in both peripheral and central nervous systems. Those present in peripheral system have been termed as CCK-A receptors and those present in central nervous system as CCK-B receptors. QSAR studies verify that CCK-B receptors are closely related structurally to gastrin receptors. QSAR studies have been reported on different classes of CCK antagonists, e.g., benzodiazepine derivatives, amino acid derivatives, quinazolinones, and peptides and pseudopeptide analogs. These QSAR studies unravel the mechanisms of interactions of each category of antagonists with the CCK receptors. In the case of benzodiazepines, the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bondings are found to be the most important binding force, while in the case of quinazolinones, only the hydrogen bonding is found to be important. The hydrophobic as well as the dispersion interactions are shown to be important for the binding of glutamic acid analogs and steric factors appear to govern the activity of peptides and pseudopeptide analogs.",

    "67": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) have been widely investigated in terms of clinical efficacy, factors underlying dependence, associated cognitive impairments, and interactions with psychotherapy for anxiety control. However, few studies have systematically considered manner of BZ administration in relation to these variables. Studies of chronic BZ users indicate that as-needed or p.r.n. use is a very common practice, increases with chronicity of BZ use, and is preferred compared to regularly scheduled BZ administration. Moreover, a recent study of physician prescription practices indicated that p.r.n. BZ use is a commonly recommended BZ use regimen for anxiety disorder management. Physician advocates of p.r.n. BZ prescriptions for anxiety disorders cite enhanced patient control over symptoms, facilitation of exposure to fear-provoking situations, and reduced frequency of use as rationales supporting this practice. Available data however, do not consistently support these hypothesized advantages of p.r.n. BZ use. And in general, findings from different investigations relevant to this question suggest that p.r.n. BZ administration may be associated with increased patient preference for BZs over placebo, continued use, and greater impairment on cognitive factors associated with positive long-term anxiety management. Ironically, p.r.n. BZ administration may also be associated with reduced anxiolytic efficacy over time. These suggestive findings argue for greater systematic investigation of manner of BZ administration as an important medication use parameter. Such investigations may also yield practical guidelines for navigating BZ discontinuation and promoting more successful long-term management of anxiety.",

In particular, this paper focuses on recent findings regarding time course-related effects on BZ-induced deficits in explicit and implicit human memory performance. Specifically, we reviewed recent research indicating that both explicit memory and priming are impaired by BZs if the encoding task takes place near the time of the theoretical peak plasma concentrations of the drug. Although BZs also appear to increase objective and subjective sedation, as well as to impair attentional processing, these other cognitive impairments do not appear to fully account for the widespread memory deficits caused by BZ administration. The theoretical and clinical implications of benzodiazepine-induced memory impairments are discussed.",

The present article reviews evidence from animal studies on effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for BZ dependence and withdrawal. It explores the risk-benefit profiles of putative therapies for BZ withdrawal, including drugs acting via benzodiazepine receptors, serotonergic and noradrenergic agents, cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, and other miscellaneous agents.",

Although safe, tolerance develops rapidly to their sedative activity and more slowly to their anticonvulsant activity. In animals anxiolytic tolerance has also been measured. Abrupt cessation of benzodiazepine treatment leads to symptoms of withdrawal. The mechanisms responsible for these phenomena are not known. Benzodiazepines act via GABA(A) receptors, but do not appear to produce tolerance and dependence by simple downregulation of receptor number. GABA(A) receptors are hetero-oligomers comprised of multiple subunits encoded by a multigene family.

The present special issue consists of series of five papers covering current issues in the area of benzodiazepine side effects. These reviews cover a wide range of topics pertaining to adverse, unintended consequences of this class of pharmacologic agents including their potential for tolerance and withdrawal, their profile of associated cognitive impairments, as well as current understanding of means for minimizing these unintended effects. The reviews also cover a variety of methodologies and disciplines from laboratory-based research findings with animals, to laboratory-based studies with healthy human volunteers, to findings obtained in the clinic with anxious patients.

In this study, we investigated the effect of M2-antagonist (otenzepad) on M2-peptide-induced cardiomyopathy in rabbits. New Zealand White rabbits were divided into four groups: 1) control group, saline injection; 2) M2-peptide group, M2-peptide injection; 3) M2-antagonist group, otenzepad (30 mg/day) orally and saline injection; and (4) M2-antagonist + M2-peptide group, otenzepad (30 mg/day) orally and M2-peptide injection. The study duration was 1 year. Saline or peptide was injected once a month. All rabbits in both the M2-peptide group and the M2-antagonist + M2-peptide group had high titers of anti-M2-autoantibodies in their sera. Rabbits in the M2-peptide group showed an increase in heart weight, wall thinning and dilatation of the right ventricle. On the contrary, rabbits in the M2-antagonist + M2-peptide group had normal heart weight and shape. All rabbits in the M2-peptide group showed multifocal degeneration and necrosis of myocardial cells with moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells, while four rabbits in the M2-antagonist + M2-peptide group showed slight infiltration of inflammatory cells with normal myocardial cells and interstitium, and another three showed no histological changes in the hearts.

    "74": "We evaluated the impact of yohimbine administration on benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in the central nervous system of non-human primates (rhesus monkeys). Estimates of the binding potential (Bmax/Kd) of BDZ receptors were made following intravenous administration of yohimbine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Positron emission tomography was used in conjunction with [11C]flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), a tracer for central BDZ receptor binding activity. The effects of yohimbine were compared with a control condition in which saline was administered. Yohimbine significantly increased the binding potential in the hippocampus, as assessed using a Student's t-test with Bonferroni correction. The result that the administration of yohimbine readily induces an increase in the binding potential for BDZ receptors in the primate brain suggests that the presence of an anxiety state potentiates the effect of anxiolytics.",

The projects main goal is to develop and support proper palliative care to all severe ill and dying patients in Norway. In a prospective study we examined 179 consecutive deaths between 1998 and 1999. Average age was 84.5. Major symptom problems were pain, dyspnoea, death-rattle and anxiety. In the last 24 hours 83% of the patients received opioids, 67% of the cases morphine (mean daily dosage 31.8 mg). 37% of the patients received scopolamine (mean daily dosage 0.8 mg), 12% benzodiazepines and 3% of the patients haloperidol. 152 (85%) of the deaths were expected, 27 (15%) unexpected. In 137 patients (77%) open, honest, frank communication with patient or their nearest kin regarding the imminent death was possible. In our experience it is a myth that the relatives want doctors to practise \"maximal therapy\". All old patients in geriatric clinics and nursing homes need palliative care. We have found no international textbooks of geriatrics with chapters on palliative care or textbooks on palliative care with chapters on the elderly. They need doctors and nurses who are properly trained and educated in palliative care. In most countries in Europe this training and education is not provided.", 
    "76": "The behavioural responses to two commonly used 'predator odours' were assessed in male Wistar rats. Cat odour was presented to rats in the form of a piece of collar that had been worn by a domestic cat. Fox odour was presented in an equivalent piece of (unworn) collar that had been impregnated with 2,4,5 Trimethylthiazoline (TMT)-an extract of fox faeces. Other rats were exposed to collars containing Triethylamine (TEA), a putrid fishy smell, or formaldehyde, which has an acrid irritating smell. Experiment 1 showed that rats approached cat odour, TMT and TEA significantly less than they did an unworn collar. However, only cat odour increased retreat to the hide box, reduced locomotor activity and elicited 'head out' behaviour. When tested immediately after odour exposure, only cat odour exposed rats showed increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze and suppressed activity in a 90-min general activity test. When returned to the odour-paired environment 24 h later in the absence of test odours, only rats that had previously received cat odour showed evidence of conditioned fear. Experiment 2 showed that rats given the benzodiazepine drug midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) display increased approach and decreased defensiveness towards a cat odour impregnated collar. In contrast, midazolam accentuated the avoidance of TMT and formaldehyde containing collars. Experiment 3 showed that when cat odour was presented in a small, enclosed environment, rats display increased body immobility, decreased grooming and increased orientation towards the odour-exuding stimulus. These responses were not seen with TMT or TEA containing collars. Taken together, these results suggest that while cat odour strongly elicits specific defensive behaviours in rats, TMT has effects that are more characteristic of an aversive odour. We suggest that the results of some previous studies using TMT may need to be reassessed.",

The final model describing clonazepam clearance was CL = 152 x TBW(-0.181) x DIF, where CL is clearance (ml/kg/h), TBWis total body weight (kg), and DIF (drug interaction factor) is a scaling factor for concomitant medication with a value of 1 for patients on clonazepam monotherapy, 1.18 for those patients receiving concomitant administration of clonazepam and one antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine or valproic acid), and 2.12 x TBW(-0.119) for those patients receiving concomitant administration of clonazepam and more than two antiepileptic drugs. Clonazepam clearance decreased in a weight-related fashion in children, with minimal changes observed in adults. Concomitant administration of clonazepam and carbamazepine resulted in a 22% increase in clonazepam clearance. Concomitant administration of clonazepam and valproic acid resulted in a 12% increase in clonazepam clearance. Concomitant administration of clonazepam with two or more antiepileptic drugs resulted in a 23% to 75% increase in clonazepam clearance.", 
    "79": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and other manifestations of psychotic illness. Common side effects include somnolence, constipation, weight gain, and postural hypotension. The authors report a case of hypotension accompanied by bradycardia in a normal, healthy volunteer participating in an olanzapine pharmacokinetic study following a single 5 mg dose. A venous catheter allowed for serial blood sampling of olanzapine concentrations before, during, and after the adverse event. The subject experienced a rapid absorption of the drug and higher than anticipated maximum plasma concentrations. This case suggests that atypical antipsychotics, although generally better tolerated than conventional agents, may still result in untoward reactions that may be partially due to individual differences in drug absorption and metabolism.", 
    "80": "The management of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is crucial in preventing neurologic impairment. Although a variety of treatments for RSE including continuous infusion of midazolam (MDL) or pentobarbital (PTB) have been carried out, they are not always effective. Intravenous very-high-dose phenobarbital (PB) has been recommended as having many advantages in the United States, but is not available in Japan. We treated 3 patients suffering from long term RSE with non-intravenous high-dose PB (NIHDPB). Their seizures were not controlled by continuous infusion of MDL and/or PTB. PB was initially given intramuscularly or rectally and then orally. Within a few or ten days, seizures were completely controlled, and consciousness level gradually improved in all cases. The serum levels of PB at seizure control ranged from 50 to 58 micrograms/ml. The epileptiform activities on EEG nearly disappeared in the absence of the burst suppression pattern. Hypotention and respiratory depression did not develop during NIHDPB. Elevated gamma-GTP levels with normal hepatic transaminases were seen in all cases, but it was not necessary to discontinue NIHDPB. NIHDPB may be one of the most effective and safe treatments in Japan for status epileptics refractory to continuous infusion of MDL or PTB.", 
    "81": "We studied tropisetron (T) in patients with breast cancer receiving standard adjuvant chemotherapy with CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil) over 3 consecutive cycles; T was administered alone or in combination with dexamethasone (D) or alprazolam (A). 50 women entered and during the 1st cycle patients received T i.v. before chemotherapy and the same dose orally on each of the following 3 days. In the 2nd cycle, T was administered together with D and during the 3rd cycle, T was combined with A and continued with T over the ensuing 3 days post-chemotherapy. Stress was present in 23 women and was evaluated for its impact on antiemetic response. Differences in the emetogenic response were found for nausea and vomiting mainly with the addition of A. The combination of T+A was superior to T and T+D in acute emesis (P<0.001). Concerning delayed emesis, differences were detected with both T+D and T+A (being equally effective) and superior to T alone (P<0.001). The emetogenic potential was decreased by the addition of A in comparison to T alone (P=0.001). Patients without stress had no difference, while patients with stress had a significantly better antiemetic result with the addition of D or A to T. In conclusion, T provides a satisfactory result in controlling nausea and emesis caused by moderately emetogenic CT regimens. Addition of D or A improves the antiemetic effect, and A provides better coverage in women with stress, a finding worth exploration in larger confirmatory studies.", 
    "82": "Intensive care patients are commonly sedated to maintain comfort and to facilitate life saving therapy. Although sedation is ordered by medical staff, nurses are usually responsible for its administration and titration and thus the question of which drug regime should be chosen is an important practice issue for nurses (1,2). This paper is a report on a systematic review that was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two of the most common drugs used for the sedation of adult ventilated patients in Australian intensive care units (ICUs)--propofol and midazolam (3). All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared propofol with midazolam for the sedation of adult ventilated patients in ICUs were included in the study. The outcome measures evaluated were the quality of sedation achieved, the length of time from cessation of sedation till extubation, recovery time, duration of admission to the ICU and the incidence of haemodynamic complications. Meta-analysis was used to compare results of studies where subjects had the same characteristics and the outcome criteria were measured in the same manner. The review found that infusions of both midazolam and propofol appear to provide similar quality sedation, that extubation time and recovery time is shorter in patients sedated with propofol and that haemodynamic complications related to either drug regime are not usually clinically significant.", 
    "83": "Active treatment of acute ischemic stroke can only be successful as long as tissue in the area of ischemic compromise is still viable. Therefore, the identification of the area of irreversible damage, and its distinction from the penumbral zone, i.e., tissue with impaired function but preserved morphology, may improve the estimation of the potential efficacy of various therapeutic strategies. This can be achieved by multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET), perfusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in experimental models. Neuroimaging modalities applied in patients with acute ischemic stroke cannot reliably identify penumbra tissue and detect irreversible damage in the first hours after stroke, when treatment must be initiated to have the potential for success: multitracer studies for the assessment of flow and irreversible metabolic damage usually are limited in the clinical setting, and arterial blood sampling necessary for quantitative determinations is prohibited under certain circumstances, e.g., when thrombolysis is planned. The range of the penumbra can be assessed by combining determinations of flow and benzodiazepine receptor binding by PET of H2(15)O and 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) and relating flow values and FMZ binding to the final state of the tissue. By this approach, cumulative probability curves can be computed to predict eventual infarction or non-infarction and to define the penumbral range. The computed values are in good agreement with results from other studies proving the validity of the concept of the penumbra which was also demonstrated in several therapeutic studies in which thrombolytic treatment reversed critical ischemia and decreased the volume of the final infarcts. Such neuroimaging findings might serve as surrogate targets in the selection of other therapeutic strategies for large clinical trials.", 
    "84": "Steroid biosynthesis begins with the transfer of cholesterol from intracellular stores into mitochondria. Through in vitro and in vivo studies using various steroidogenic cell models and with the help of pharmacological, biochemical, morphological and molecular approaches we demonstrated that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18 kDa mitochondrial protein that interacts with other proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane to form a multimeric complex. PBR is required for the binding, uptake and release, upon ligand activation, of the substrate cholesterol. Thus, cholesterol becomes available to the inner mitochondrial membrane P450scc where steroid biosynthesis begins. The presence of mitochondrial PBR is also critical in maintaining outer mitochondrial membrane stability and in preventing apoptosis. Considering these functions of PBR and the fact that PBR is a ubiquitous protein, it is suggested that this drug receptor may serve as a target to control various mitochondrial and cell functions and to protect against experimentally or pathologically induced mitochondrial and cell toxicity.", 
    "85": "The Correctional Service of Canada implemented a urine drug-testing program over a decade ago. Offenders residing in federal correctional institutions and living in the community on conditional release were subject to urine drug testing. The objective of this study is to describe this testing program and the extent of drug use by conditional release offenders in 2000. Urine specimens were tested for drugs of abuse and prescription drugs including amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite, opiates, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, methyl phenidate, meperidine, pentazocine and fluoxetine by immunoassay screening followed by GC-MS confirmation. Ethyl alcohol was analyzed when specifically requested. Alternative screening and confirmation methods with lower cut-off values were used whenever urine specimens were dilute (creatinine <20 mg/dL and specific gravity <or=1.003). Total number of urine specimens analyzed in 2000 was 38,431 (6.7% were dilute). The positive rate for one or more drugs was 27.2% in 2000 in conditional release offenders. In the community setting 28,076 normally concentrated (nondilute) specimens were tested (9.6% were positive for cannabinoids and 3.3% positive for cocaine metabolite). In the 1,270 dilute specimens collected from conditional release offenders in 2000, 12.8% were positive for cannabinoids and 10.6% were positive for cocaine metabolite. The authors conclude that forensic urine drug testing provides an objective measure of drug use when assessing offenders living in the community on conditional release from correctional institutions in Canada.", 
    "86": "In clinical and forensic toxicology, doping control, and therapeutic drug monitoring, specific and sensitive detection and precise quantification of xenobiotics in biosamples are great challenges. Today, mass spectrometry techniques, coupled with gas chromatography or liquid chromatography, are the most powerful methods in analytic toxicology. The pros and cons of electron ionization (EI) and negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (APCI-LC-MS) are described for determination of the low-dosed benzodiazepine flunitrazepam and its 7-amino and its nor-metabolite in plasma. In addition, application of NICI-GC-MS is described for sensitive chiral determination of amphetamine derivatives in plasma and application of APCI-LC-MS for screening, library-assisted identification, and validated quantification of oral antidiabetics and for validated quantification of the neuroleptic risperidone and its 9-hydroxy metabolite. These examples show that NICI-GC-MS and LC-MS are powerful tools for determination of low-dosed and/or rather polar drugs or poisons, thus becoming indispensable supplements to classic EI-GC-MS in clinical and forensic toxicology as well as in doping control.", 
    "87": "Drug discrimination was used to examine the effects of benzodiazepine (BZ)(1) receptor-selective ligands in rhesus monkeys. In diazepam-treated (5.6 mg/kg, p.o.) monkeys discriminating the nonselective BZ antagonist flumazenil (0.32 mg/kg, s.c.), the BZ(1)-selective antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) substituted for flumazenil. The onset of action of beta-CCt was delayed with a dose of 5.6 mg/kg beta-CCt substituting for flumazenil 2 h after injection. In monkeys discriminating the nonselective BZ agonist midazolam (0.56 mg/kg, s.c.), the BZ(1)-selective agonists zaleplon (ED(50) = 0.78 mg/kg) and zolpidem (ED(50) = 1.73 mg/kg) substituted for midazolam. The discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam, zaleplon, and zolpidem were antagonized by beta-CCt (1.0-5.6 mg/kg, s.c.), and the effects of zaleplon and zolpidem were also antagonized by flumazenil (0.01-0.32 mg/kg, s.c.). Schild analyses supported the notion of a simple, competitive interaction between beta-CCt and midazolam (slope = -1.08; apparent pA(2) = 5.41) or zaleplon (slope = -1.57; apparent pA(2) = 5.49) and not between beta-CCt and zolpidem. Schild analyses also were consistent with a simple, competitive interaction between flumazenil and zaleplon (slope = -1.03; apparent pA(2) = 7.45) or zolpidem (slope = -1.11; apparent pA(2) = 7.63). These results suggest that the same BZ receptor subtype(s) mediate(s) the effects of midazolam, zolpidem, and zaleplon under these conditions and that selective binding of BZ ligands does not necessarily confer selective effects in vivo.", 
    "88": "The antiepileptic drug riluzole is a use-dependent blocker of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and selectively depresses action potential-driven glutamate over gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. Here we report that in addition to its presynaptic effect, riluzole at higher concentrations also strongly potentiates postsynaptic GABA(A) responses both in cultured hippocampal neurons and in Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant receptors. Although peak inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of autaptic hippocampal neurons were inhibited, 20-100 microM riluzole significantly prolonged the decay of IPSCs, resulting in little change in total charge transfer. The effect was dose-dependent and reversible. Riluzole selectively increased miniature IPSC fast and slow decay time constants, without affecting their relative proportions. Miniature IPSC peak amplitude, rise time and frequency were unaffected, indicating a postsynaptic mechanism. In the Xenopus oocyte expression system, riluzole potentiated GABA responses by lowering the EC(50) for GABA activation. Riluzole directly gated a GABA(A) current that was partially blocked by bicuculline and gabazine. Pharmacological experiments suggest that the action of riluzole did not involve a benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or neurosteroid site. Instead, riluzole-induced potentiation was inhibited by the lactone antagonist alpha-isopropyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolatone (alpha-IMGBL). While most anticonvulsants either block voltage-gated Na(+) channels or potentiate GABA(A) receptors, our results suggest that riluzole may define an advantageous class of anticonvulsants with both effects.", 
    "89": "The effects of long-term treatment with and subsequent withdrawal of the two hypnotic drugs zaleplon and zolpidem on the abundance of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor subunit mRNAs in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells were investigated. Incubation of neurons with either drug at a concentration of 10 microM for 5 days did not significantly affect the amounts of mRNAs encoding the alpha(1), alpha(4), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3), gamma(2)L, or gamma(2)S subunits. As expected, similar treatment with the nonselective benzodiazepine diazepam resulted in a decrease in the abundance of alpha(1), beta(2), gamma(2)L, and gamma(2)S subunit mRNAs as well as an increase in that of the beta(1) subunit mRNA. Withdrawal of zaleplon or zolpidem, like that of diazepam, induced a marked increase in the amount of the alpha(4) subunit mRNA. In addition, discontinuation of treatment with either hypnotic drug resulted in a decrease in the amounts of alpha(1), beta(2), gamma(2)L, and gamma(2)S subunit mRNAs as well as an increase in that of the beta(1) subunit mRNA. These effects of zaleplon and zolpidem on GABA(A) receptor gene expression are consistent with the reduced tolerance liability of these drugs, compared with that of diazepam, as well as with their ability to induce both physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "90": "Intranasal administration of midazolam has been of particular interest because of the rapid and reliable onset of action, predictable effects, and avoidance of injections. The available intravenous formulation (Dormicum i.v. solution from Hoffmann-La Roche) is however less than optimal for intranasal administration due to low midazolam concentration and acidity of the formulation (pH 3.0-3.3). In this study midazolam was formulated in aqueous sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin buffer solution. The nasal spray was tested in 12 healthy volunteers and compared to intravenous midazolam in an open crossover trial. Clinical sedation effects, irritation, and serum drug levels were monitored. The absolute bioavailability of midazolam in the nasal formulation was determined to be 64 +/- 19% (mean +/- standard deviation). The peak serum concentration from nasal application, 42 +/- 11 ng ml-1, was reached within 10-15 min following administration and clinical sedative effects were observed within 5 to 10 min and lasted for about 40 min. Intravenous administration gave clinical sedative effects within 3 to 4 min, which lasted for about 35 minutes. Mild to moderate, transient irritation of nasal and pharyngeal mucosa was reported. The nasal formulation approaches the intravenous form in speed of absorption, serum concentration and clinical sedation effect. No serious side effects were observed.",

In 1999, however, 33.1% urine toxicology tests showed positive results for opioids, 22.2% for cocaine and 24% for benzodiazepines. It could be shown that the number of cocaine positive toxicology results increased significantly (p < 0.05) over the course of two years, and that the number of opioid positive tests decreased significantly (p < 0.05), whereas benzodiazepine consumption did not change. Age, and the duration of opioid dependence showed a significant influence on cocaine positive urinalysis.", 
    "94": "The significant increase of additional cocaine consumption in methadone maintained patients reflects the enhanced availability of the substance in Austria, as it has been shown in other European countries and the USA.

    "95": "Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug recently approved in Italy for clinical use. Therapeutic monitoring of lamotrigine is relevant for patient management and avoidance of toxicity. The authors describe a simple, sensitive, and highly selective high-performance liquid chromatography method that does not involved extraction for analysis of serum lamotrigine. Serum (20 microL) with internal standard (BW 725 C) was injected directly into a column (25 cm x 4.6 mm) with an internal surface reversed phase (ISRP). The mobile phase consisted of 0.01 mol/L potassium phosphate bibasic (pH 6.0) and acetonitrile (82:18), the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and UV detection was optimized at 330 nm. The overall between-run coefficient of variance ranged from 1.89% to 3.25% and the lowest limit of detection was 0.05 mg/L. High linearity (r = 0.9996) in a wide range of concentrations (0.1-20.0 mg/L) and no interference with other antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants were the other characteristics of the method. The innovation of this method is the use of ISRP column and the choice of detection wavelength, which allow a shorter analysis time (5-6 minutes). The possibility of direct injection of plasma samples into the column permits a reduction in reagent consumption and in analytic steps, and hence in analytic error.", 
    "96": "Many studies have demonstrated mismatch negativity (MMN) attenuation in schizophrenia. Recently, investigators have shown that GABAergic inhibitory neurons may regulate MMN generation. Considering that a substantial proportion of schizophrenic patients receive anxiolytics and hypnotics that have affinity to GABA(A) receptors to reduce their comorbid symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbances, we need to assess whether anxiolytics/hypnotics might affect their MMN generation. The aim of this study is to assess the possibility that high or low doses of anxiolytics/hypnotics received by schizophrenic subjects affect their mismatch negativity (MMN), using event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).",

    "100": "Defensive behaviors of lower mammals confronted with a predatory stimulus provide an appropriate laboratory model for investigating behavior relevant to human emotional disorders. The mouse defense test battery (MDTB) has been developed because it combines many of the aspects of defense. Briefly, it consists of five tests either associated with potential threat (contextual defense) or the actual presence of an approaching threat (a rat). These latter focus on changes in flight, risk assessment and defensive threat and attack behaviors. Investigations with anxiolytic compounds have shown that these defense reactions may be used to differentiate between several classes of anxiolytic drugs. Here we used the MDTB to compare the behavioral profile of the benzodiazepine diazepam with that of neuropeptide receptor antagonists which have been shown to be involved in the modulation of stress response, namely the NK(2) receptor antagonists, SR48968 (0.01-1mg/kg) and SR144190 (1-10mg/kg), and the NT(1) receptor antagonist, SR48692 (1-30mg/kg). Results showed that all compounds decreased defensive threat/attack, but only diazepam and, to a lesser extent, SR48692 significantly modified risk assessment or flight. Further, none of the neuropeptide receptor antagonists modified contextual defense. Overall, the behavioral profile displayed by diazepam and these latter compounds in the MDTB are consistent with an anxiolytic-like action. However, our results suggest that, while NK(2) and NT(1) receptor antagonists may have limited efficacy on anxiety-related responses including cognitive aspects (i.e. risk assessment), they may have a potential against some forms of anxiety disorders which involve adaptative responses to extreme stress stimuli (e.g. direct confrontation with the threat stimulus).", 
    "101": "Studies of the response of rodents to predatory odors (mainly cat) have provided useful insights into the nature of defensive behavior. This article reviews work in this area with a focus on a behavioral paradigm recently developed in our laboratory in which we present rats with a piece of fabric collar that has been previously worn by a cat. Rats presented with this stimulus spent most of their time engaged in a behavior we call 'head out' in which the rat pokes its head out from a hide box and scans the environment. Periodic 'flat back approaches' and 'vigilant rearing' towards the cat odor source are seen as well as inhibition of non-defensive behaviors such as locomotor activity and grooming. Cat odor causes a sustained increase in blood pressure (> 15mm Hg) without greatly affecting heart beat rate. Rats will develop conditioned fear to both contexts and cues that have been paired with cat odor. C-fos immunohistochemistry indicates that cat odor selectively activates a defensive behavior circuit involving the medial amygdala, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamus, dorsal premammillary nucleus and the periaqueductal gray. The defensive response to cat odor is attenuated by acute administration of the benzodiazepine midazolam (0.375 mg/kg), with chronically administered SSRI antidepressants and acute alcohol exerting more modest anxiolytic effects. The behavioral response to cat odor is very different to that seen to trimethylthiazoline (TMT: fox odor) which has effects more like those seen to an aversive putrid odor. It is concluded that cat odor is a useful tool for elucidating behavioral, neural, pharmacological and autonomic aspects of defensive behavior and anxiety.", 
    "102": "Previous research has suggested that high doses of conventional neuroleptics may induce neurocognitive deficits when assessed with standard tasks. However, little is known about the effects of high doses of neuroleptics (conventional or atypical) on subjective cognitive dysfunction. Recent research stresses the putative importance of self-reported cognitive deficits for both symptomatic outcome and medication compliance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of neuroleptic medication on subjective cognition in patients treated with either conventional or atypical agents (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine). Patients were asked to endorse the items of a questionnaire entitled 'Subjective Well-Being under Neuroleptic Treatment' prior to discharge. Subjective impairment, as assessed with the subscale 'mental functioning', was significantly correlated with greater conventional neuroleptic dosage after controlling for psychopathology (P<0.05). The difference between patients medicated with higher doses of conventional neuroleptics and those with lower doses was highly significant (P<0.001). In contrast, higher atypical neuroleptic doses were not associated with impairment.", 
    "103": "The role of sedation in the benzodiazepine-induced impairment of conscious recollection is still subject to debate. The aim of this study was to investigate further the role of sedation using the Remember-Know procedure and a physiological measure of sedation based on pupillography in addition to standard measures of sedation and attention (digit-symbol substitution task, symbol cancellation task, self-rated sedation). Twelve subjects were tested after the intake of placebo, lorazepam 0.026 mg/kg and lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg, administered in a randomized order, with a minimum interval of 8 days between each administration. On a recognition memory task, they were asked to give 'Remember', 'Know' or 'Guess' responses to items that were recognized on the basis of conscious recollection, familiarity, or guessing, respectively. Lorazepam selectively impaired recognition based on 'Remember' responses. This impairment was greater in the lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg than in the lorazepam 0.026 mg/kg groups. Measures of sedation were not correlated with the proportion of 'Remember' responses. These results suggest that sedation alone cannot account for the impairment of conscious recollection induced by lorazepam.",

    "105": "The records of 106 children (1.2-11.3 years, ASA I or II) undergoing ambulatory dental restorations were randomly selected and retrospectively reviewed: 50 subjects received midazolam (M) 0.5 mg/kg orally approximately 30 minutes prior to their procedure and 56 control subjects received no premedication (C). General anesthesia consisted primarily of inhalational anesthesia. Time in the operating room (OR), post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and same day surgery (SDS) were determined and compared between groups.", 
    "106": "Both groups were similar with respect to age and weight. There were no significant differences between groups in time spent in the OR, PACU or SDS (p>0.05). In a subset of children having shorter dental procedures (OR time < or =75 minutes, n=29), there remained no significant difference in discharge times between groups.",

    "108": "Evaluation of the modified \"postanaesthesiological questionnaire\" pointed to a subtle influencing of the condition of patients who had undergone 3rd molar surgery in general anaesthesia by using different premedication variants: \"Atropine, Pethidine and Midazolam\" (group A) and \"Atropine, Midazolam and S-Ketamin\" (group B). The combination in group B seems to be more suitable. On the one hand, a lower incidence of unwanted side-effects was found and, on the other hand, remarkable positive effects were observed. Of particular significance with this combination was also the more effective suppression of postoperative pain. The Propofol-supplemented general anaesthesia prepared in this way and administered using a nasal intubation technique found the full approval of the patients. Postoperative pain therapy was effective and also inexpensive, costing just 8.20 DM per patient, according to current prices calculated by Magdeburg University Hospital.", 
    "109": "The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of two bromazepam (CAS 1812-30-2) formulations in 24 healthy volunteers. An open, randomised clinical trial designed as two-period crossover with 14-day washout between doses was employed. Plasma samples for assessments of their bromazepam concentration by HPLC-UV were obtained over 96 h after administration. No adverse effect was reported for any of the formulations administered. The following pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated: AUC(0-96 h), AUCinf, Cmax, Tmax, Ke and T1/2. The 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the mean test/reference individual ratios were 81-109 for AUC and 84-116 for Cmax. Since the 90% CI for both, AUC and Cmax ratios were within the 80-125% interval proposed by the Food and Drug Administration, it is concluded that the new bromazepam slow-release formulation is therapeutic equivalent to the conventional formulation for both, the extent and the rate of absorption after single dose administration in healthy volunteers.",

    "111": "The urinary 6beta-OH-cortisol/cortisol ratio is a specific, non-invasive marker for evaluating inductive or inhibitory effects on cytochrome P450 3A activity. We propose a new quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with isotope dilution (GC-ID-MS) method for the simultaneous determination of urinary free cortisol (UFC) and 6beta-OH-cortisol (6beta-OHC). The method utilizes the following: (a) addition of internal standard (2H2 cortisol) to 1 ml of urine; (b) loading on to an Extrelut column and elution with dichloromethane; (c) derivatization to dimethoxime tri-(trimethyl-silyl)ether (MOX-TMS); (d) separation and identification by GC-ID-MS. The detection limit for cortisol was 22 pg injected (signal-to-noise ratio 10:1) and for 6beta-OH-cortisol 123 pg injected (signal-to-noise ratio 10:1). The intra-assay and the inter-assay imprecision were 4.69% and 7.4% for 6beta-OHC and 2.44% and 3.53% for cortisol, respectively. We used this method to analyze 57 morning urine samples of healthy volunteers and patients under different conditions. We found that chronic alcoholics had a significantly higher ratio of 6beta-OHC/UFC compared to controls (p<0.0001), whereas adults undergoing methadone therapy and patients with acute alcohol intoxication exhibited a significantly lower urinary 6beta-OHC/UFC ratio (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). The proposed method allows a rapid and accurate assessment of the 6beta-OHC/UFC ratio.",

Administration of harmine in doses of 0.5, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg (i.p.) elicited a dose-dependent increase of the dopamine efflux to 152, 173, and 243% and a decrease in DOPAC to 52, 36, and 10%, and HVA to 67, 45, and 20% throughout, respectively; 5-HIAA concentrations were decreased to 81, 74, and 72% only. In contrast to D-amphetamine, which also increases dopamine release and decreases its metabolites, the stimulatory action of harmine on dopamine release in the striatum was totally abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 microM). Similar to monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibitors, harmine potentiated the stimulatory effect of D-amphetamine (10 microM), infused by reverse microdialysis in the striatum, on dopamine release. Pre-treatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (5 mg/kg, i.p.) did not modulate the effect of harmine on striatal dopamine release and metabolism. Administration of the reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide (20 mg/kg, i.p.), induced an increase in dopamine to 256% and a decrease in DOPAC, HVA, and 5-HIAA to 30, 24, and 62%, respectively, reproducing a pattern similar to that of harmine. Taken together, these results indicate that harmine affects the brain dopamine system probably by acting as a MAO-A inhibitor and not as an inverse agonist for the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "113": "The pattern of acute memory impairment produced by alcohol is similar to that produced by the benzodiazepines. However, in contrast to demonstrations that benzodiazepines decrease false recognition rates, results of a recent study suggest that a low dose of alcohol increases false recognition rates; false recognition refers to the phenomenon of mistakenly claiming that one has been exposed previously to a novel item.", 
    "114": "This study was designed to examine the acute dose-effects of alcohol on false recognition.", 
    "115": "Effects of alcohol (0.27 and 0.60 g/kg) on performance in the Deese/Roediger-McDermott false recognition paradigm were examined in a repeated measures placebo-controlled double-blind design in 18 healthy volunteers.", 
    "116": "The 0.60 g/kg dose of alcohol significantly reduced true recognition rates (measured by hit rate) and induced a more conservative response bias (measured by C) relative to placebo; however, neither alcohol dose significantly impaired participants' sensitivity in discriminating between old and new words (d'). Neither alcohol dose affected false recognition rates.", 
    "117": "Effects of alcohol on false recognition and on response bias may differ from those observed previously with benzodiazepines. A direct comparison at equivalent doses will be necessary to draw conclusions about qualitative differences between alcohol and benzodiazepines.",

Primary outcomes measured were length of stay in the ICU and hospital.", 
    "123": "The mean onset of delirium was 2.6 days (S.D.+/-1.7), and the mean duration was 3.4+/-1.9 days. Of the 48 patients, 39 (81.3%) developed delirium, and of these 29 (60.4%) developed the complication while still in the ICU. The duration of delirium was associated with length of stay in the ICU ( r=0.65, P=0.0001) and in the hospital ( r=0.68, P<0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, delirium was the strongest predictor of length of stay in the hospital ( P=0.006) even after adjusting for severity of illness, age, gender, race, and days of benzodiazepine and narcotic drug administration.", 
    "124": "In this patient cohort, the majority of patients developed delirium in the ICU, and delirium was the strongest independent determinant of length of stay in the hospital. Further study and monitoring of delirium in the ICU and the risk factors for its development are warranted.", 
    "125": "General anesthetics modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels including the GABA(A) receptor. Mutational studies mainly on the benzodiazepine-insensitive alpha(2)beta(1(M286W)) and alpha(6)beta(3(N289M))gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors revealed that a serine in transmembrane domain 2 and a methionine in transmembrane domain 3 are essential for the action of most general anesthetics. We investigated whether these residues would similarly be relevant for their action at the benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA receptor subtype, alpha(2)beta(3)gamma(2). We found that not only the N265M but also the M286W mutation nearly abolished the modulatory effect of etomidate. However, the anti-convulsant loreclezole, a structural homologue of etomidate, was inactive on the N265M mutant, but displayed normal modulatory activity on the M286W mutant. Both mutations did not affect the modulatory action of the neurosteroid alphaxalone. The direct action of alphaxalone, however, was dramatically increased in the M286W mutant to about twice the maximal GABA current but not significantly affected in the N265M mutant. These data demonstrate that the structural requirements for modulatory and direct actions of various general anesthetics are distinct. The molecular switches induced by these mutations can be exploited to identify the molecular determinants for the action of general anesthetics.", 
    "126": "A novel parenteral formulation for tetrazepam (10 mg/ml) was developed using lipid emulsions. This formulation utilized a new lipid emulsion formulation, which was developed by changing the polarity of the oil phase. It was found that increasing the polarity of the oil phase resulted in enhanced solubility of tetrazepam. Tetrazepam showed higher solubility in a mixture of castor oil and middle-chain triglycerides (MCTs) (1:1) than in any other oil investigated. This mixture resulted in low interfacial tension and moderate viscosity, which seemed to be the optimum oil phase. In addition, to increase the concentration of tetrazepam, an emulsion formulation containing 30% oil phase was produced and optimized. The drug-free emulsion formulation showed fine particle sizes with an imperceptible change in physicochemical properties after more than 2 years on the shelf. As a result, it was possible to produce a parenteral emulsion formulation containing 10 mg/ml tetrazepam. No change in the physicochemical properties of the emulsion was observed after the addition of tetrazepam. The tetrazepam emulsion showed stable behavior during the autoclaving process and good shelf stability for at least 10 months as well. Tetrazepam itself also displayed good stability during the autoclaving process and also showed good shelf stability in this emulsion formulation.",

The patient had been taking olanzapine, valproic acid, carbamazepine, hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene, and conjugated estrogens prior to admission. Olanzapine was the last medication added to the regimen. In addition to clinicians treating the DKA with appropriate interventions, olanzapine (due to possible association with hyperglycemia and DKA) as well as valproic acid (due to possible association with pancreatitis) were discontinued from the medication regimen. The patient was discharged home and her most recent glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting glucose concentrations have been within the normal range.",

We defined cohorts of first-time users of haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine aged 15 to 54 years. In the first 90 days of treatment, we assessed the occurrence of EPS, defined as first use of any antiparkinsonian agent. We estimated relative risks of EPS for risperidone and olanzapine versus haloperidol using a Cox proportional hazards model. Patients were subdivided according to prior use of antipsychotic and antiparkinsonian drugs.", 
    "140": "We identified 424 patients starting treatment with haloperidol, 243 with risperidone, and 181 with olanzapine. Prior use of antipsychotic plus antiparkinsonian medication was significantly more frequent among users of risperidone and olanzapine than in those using haloperidol (36.2%, 40.3%, and 4.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Within most subgroups of comparable treatment history, patients using risperidone and olanzapine showed reduced risks of EPS compared with haloperidol, although some of these findings did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.03-0.22). However, this was not observed for patients using risperidone who had experienced EPS in the past (RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.24 to 7.18).", 
    "141": "In general, we observed reduced risks of EPS for risperidone and olanzapine compared with haloperidol within subgroups of patients with a similar treatment history. However, the added value of risperidone in patients who have experienced EPS in the past needs further study.", 
    "142": "Today, a wide range of efficient analgesic and non-analgesic drugs for the treatment of back pain are available. However, drugs should never be the only mainstay of a back pain treatment program. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are widely used in acute back pain. NSAIDs prescribed at regular intervals are effective to reduce simple back pain. The different NSAIDs are effective for the reduction of this pain. They have serious adverse effects, particularly at high doses, in the elderly, and on long-term administration. The new cyclooxygenase II-inhibitors have less gastrointestinal complications. But the long-term experiences are limited up to now. Considerable controversy exists about the use of opioid analgesics in chronic noncancer pain. Many physicians are concerned about the effectiveness and adverse effects of opioids. Other clinicians argue that there is a role for opioid therapy in chronic noncancer pain, e. g. especially in chronic low back pain. There is a low incidence of organ toxicity in patients who respond to opioids. The incidence of abuse and addiction is likewise relatively low. The potential for increased function and improved quality of life seems to outweigh the risks. However, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCT) on opioid therapy in a multimodal pain treatment approach. Clinical experience and some studies suggest administration of sustained release opioids because of better comfort for the patient and less risks for addiction. The opioids should be selected due to the specific side effects of the different drugs. For patients with pre-existing constipation transdermal fentanyl should be preferred. Antidepressant medications have been used for the treatment of chronic back pain, though there is only little scientific evidence for their effectiveness. There is no evidence for the use of antidepressants in acute low back pain. Trials of muscle relaxants for patients with acute back pain have used a wide range of agents, e. g. benzodiazepines. They mostly reduce acute back pain, but they have significant adverse effects including drowsiness and psychological and physical dependence even after relatively short treatment. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in the treatment of chronic back pain. Drugs are sometimes necessary for the patients to begin and persevere a multimodal treatment program. Drug therapy should be terminated as soon as other treatment strategies succeed. Unfortunately, no studies exist evaluating the place of analgesics within a multimodal treatment program.", 
    "143": "Bergamottin, a furanocoumarin isolated from grapefruit juice, was investigated for the ability to increase diazepam bioavailability and for its effect on cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in the beagle dog liver and intestine. To study the effect of bergamottin on diazepam pharmacokinetics, male beagle dogs were dosed with bergamottin (1 mg/kg) p.o. 0 or 2 h before p.o. diazepam (10 mg). In a second experiment, bergamottin (0.1 mg/kg) was dosed i.v. or p.o. 1 h before p.o. diazepam (10 mg). Plasma samples were collected over 24 h postdose, analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass tandem spectrometry, and diazepam pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. To study the effect of bergamottin on P450 enzymes, beagle dog liver and jejunum was harvested after a 10-day dosing regimen of bergamottin (1 mg/kg) p.o. per day; microsomes were prepared and analyzed for CYP3A12, CYP2B11, CYP1A1/2, and tolbutamide hydroxylase activity. Bergamottin predosing increased the plasma levels of diazepam as observed by C(max) (278.75 ng/ml versus 5.49 ng/ml) and the area under the curve [AUC((0-TLDC))] (247.69 versus 2.79 ng x hr/ml) in bergamottin versus placebo groups, respectively, indicating P450 enzyme inhibition. Diazepam plasma concentrations were increased to a similar level in the presence of i.v. and p.o. administered bergamottin. In hepatic microsomes, bergamottin treatment for 10 days reduced the activity of CYP3A12 by 50% and CYP1A1/2 by 75%. Tolbutamide hydroxylase activity did not change, and CYP2B11 activity was moderately induced. In jejunal microsomes, CYP3A12 activity doubled with bergamottin treatment. CYP2B11, CYP1A1/2 activity and tolbutamide hydroxylation was not detected. In conclusion, bergamottin is both an inhibitor and an inducer of P450 enzymes.", 
    "144": "A 42-year-old woman with a history of depression was found unconscious, lying near her car in an early autumn morning. The lower part of her body was undressed and there were multiple purple spots and excoriations on the body suggesting at first a sexual assault. On admission to the intensive care unit, she presented a hypothermia with a central temperature of 28.4 degrees C. The biological samples obtained at the hospital were analysed. Blood concentration of bromazepam was 7.7 mg/l, which is above the highest level reported till now in a case of fatal intoxication.", 
    "145": "It has been described recently that low concentrations of benzodiazepines stimulate the transport activity of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, whereas high concentrations inhibit it. The present study is aimed to investigate whether benzodiazepines have similar effects on the two glial glutamate transporter, EAAT1 and EAAT2. To this end, the transporters were transiently expressed in CHO cells and transport activity was determined by isotope fluxes using D-aspartate as non-metabolizable homologue of L-glutamate. At low D-aspartate concentrations (1 micromol/l) EAAT1-mediated uptake was reduced significantly by low concentrations of oxazepam (1 micromol/l) and diazepam (1 and 10 micromol/l). At 100 micromol/l D-aspartate oxazepam stimulated EAAT1-mediated uptake up to 150% in a dose dependent manner, whereas the inhibition by low concentrations of diazepam was attenuated. In contrast, a significant effect of diazepam on EAAT2-mediated uptake was only observed at 1000 micromol/l where uptake was inhibited by 60%. A similar inhibition was observed for EAAT1. These studies demonstrate a different modulation of EAAT1 and EAAT2 by benzodiazepines. Furthermore the glial transporters differ from the neuronal glutamate transporter. Thus, a complex in vivo response of the various transporters to benzodiazepines can be expected."
