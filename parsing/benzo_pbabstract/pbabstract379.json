Gallbladder contractions were monitored by means of chronically implanted force transducers in conscious dogs. Postprandial gallbladder contractions were partially inhibited by atropine and hexamethonium, and completely inhibited by devazepide. In vitro contractile response of canine gallbladder muscle strips to CCK-8 was also studied. CCK-8-induced muscle strip contraction was atropine and tetrodotoxin resistant, but was completely eliminated by devazepide. The existence of CCK receptors in the vagal nerve and gallbladder was examined by means of autoradiography. Forty-eight hours after ligation of the abdominal vagus, CCK-8 binding sites were found to accumulate in the subdiaphragmatic vagal nerve immediately proximal to the ligature, and similar binding sites were also found in the gallbladder smooth muscle layer. These binding sites were displaced by the addition of 10(-7) mol/1 unlabeled CCK-8 and devazepide, but L-365,260 had no effect. In conclusion, it is considerable that postprandial CCK-induced gallbladder contractions are controlled through CCK-A receptors both on the vagal nerve in stimulating endogenous release of acetylcholine and on the gallbladder directly to stimulate muscle contraction in the dog.", 
    "1": "In 1875, Caton was already able to detect cerebral electric currents during experimental studies in animals. In 1914, Cybulski and Jele\u0144ska-Macieszyna reported on the increase of current-intensity during a focal motor epileptic seizure. In 1929 in Jena, Berger revolutionized the study of epilepsy with his paper on the human electroencephalogram 'Uber das Elektrenkephalogramm des Menschen'. His discovery and further publications as well as later works of numerous researchers, especially F. and E. Gibbs, Lennox, Penfield and Jasper, made it possible to distinguish different forms of 'little' epileptic seizures and to separate them from nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders. New epileptic syndromes could be singled out, as e.g. the symptomatic epilepsy of childhood with variable clinical manifestations of seizures and slow spike-wave complexes in the EEG (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) or the benign partial epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal EEG spikes. In these fields, as well as for the epileptic seizures in newborns and babies and for the differentiation between epileptic and nonepileptic twilight states in later stages of life, the EEG remains an indispensable tool in the CT and MRI era. It also contributes largely to the diagnosis of nonepileptic cerebral illness such as herpes simplex encephalitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis van Bogaert and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Since the introduction of phenobarbital by Hauptmann in 1912, the palet of effective drugs against epilepsy, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate and benzodiazepines used for status-epilepticus treatment, became essentially larger. The value of newer substances (vigabatrin, progabide, gabapentin, lamotrigin) can't be estimated actually.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "In unanesthetized decerebrate rats, GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride), an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, and MK-801 (dizocilpine), an NMDA receptor antagonist, acted synergistically to depress the micturition reflex. MK-801 (1 mg/kg i.v.) and GYKI 52466 (4 mg/kg i.v.) administered separately had no or only a small depressant effect on reflex bladder contractions but markedly depressed external urethral sphincter activity. However, in MK-801-treated rats, GYKI 52466 decreased the amplitude, frequency and duration of reflex bladder contractions. These results suggest that both AMPA/kainate and NMDA glutamate receptors are important in the micturition reflex pathway and that these receptors may be activated in parallel at some site in the pathway so that excitatory transmission via only one receptor type is sufficient to mediate reflex activation of the bladder.", 
    "3": "Disturbed or inadequate sleep is a frequent complaint with a great impact on daily functions and an often chronic course requiring adequate treatment. To choose an appropriate therapy it is necessary to develop a useful, reliable, valid and specific diagnostic procedure. Primary care physicians can recognize and treat most sleep disorders. For special diagnostic cases sleep centers are recommended. Sleep disorders may be managed by adequate pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological treatment. Besides specific pharmacological means, education in sleep/wake physiology and hygiene and several psychotherapeutic strategies may be valuable.", 
    "4": "The determination of fetal drug exposure is of great importance for the future development of the neonate. Meconium, the first fecal material excreted by the newborn is an excellent depository for drugs to which the fetus has been exposed. Correct diagnosis of drug use during pregnancy allows the child to receive specialized treatment and care, which will aid in learning behavioral development. Meconium analysis is gaining significant credibility as an alternative or an additional sample to neonatal or maternal urine, because meconium provides a longer history of drug use than urine and drug concentrations are higher. Therefore, number of false negative results is decreased. Meconium analysis is a relatively new scientific development. Reported analytical procedures and techniques for drugs and metabolites in meconium are predominantly cocaine-related, although other compounds have been studied. Meconium, a complex matrix, requires pre-treatment and the extraction of drugs using organic solvents and solid-phases is discussed. Preliminary drug screening using predominantly immunoassays and quantitative confirmatory analytical chromatographic methods, are reviewed. Drugs of abuse described include cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine, marijuana, opiates, nicotine, benzodiazepines and barbiturates.", 
    "5": "We report here on configurational and conformational studies undertaken on the bromofluoro-1,4-benzodiazepinooxazole derivative I, which has previously been found capable of undergoing total spontaneous resolution under racemizing conditions. Due to its bridgehead N-atom I may exist in any of four diastereomeric forms, CRNR (or CSNS) and CRNS (or CSNR). Molecular mechanics calculations revealed that in their lowest energy conformations the CRNR (or CSNS) diastereomers were favored over the CRNS (or CSNR) diastereomers by some 3.42 kcal/mol, while semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations indicated heats of formation also favoring the CRNR (or CSNS) diastereomers by 3.83 kcal/mol. The 1H NMR spectra of the three crystalline modifications (alpha, beta and gamma) of I were examined in acetone, and found to be identical. These data, combined with the results of the above calculations, suggest that I exists in methanol or methanol-acetone solutions as the CRNR (or CSNS) enantiomer prior to its racemization.", 
    "6": "Sedation in the critically ill patient is essential to ensure maximal quality of life in the high-stress environment of the intensive care unit. The main goals of sedation include augmentation of pain control, management of agitation and psychological distress, and improvement of patient tolerance and acceptance of the endotracheal tube and ventilatory support. Ideally, the sedated patient should be asleep yet easily rousable. This is most commonly achieved in practice with a combination of morphine and benzodiazepines although a variety of combinations of drugs have been utilized. Other agents which have been employed include, other opiates such as fentanyl and sufentanil, butyrophenones such as haloperidol, and anesthetics such as propofol. These agents will be reviewed with respect to their role in sedating the critically ill patient.", 
    "7": "In a prospective study of 4234 patients with acute poisoning in the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Gent in Belgium between 1983 and 1990, we observed a decline in the number of poisonings from 665 in 1983 to 424 in 1990. This was due to a decrease in the number of deliberate self-poisonings. Fifty-six per cent of patients were female and the most prevalent age group was 20 to 24 years. There was no seasonal variation. The substances most frequently taken were benzodiazepines (55% of the deliberate self-poisonings), ethanol in combination with other substances (35.8%), barbiturates and older hypnotics (18.6%), non-narcotic analgesics (13.3%) and tricyclic antidepressants (11.6%). Carbon monoxide accounted for 65.1% of all the accidental poisonings. With regard to treatment, a reduction in gastric lavage was observed. The patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (29.2%), the psychiatry ward (23.6%) or discharged home (27.8%). Only 0.3% of the patients died in the Emergency Department.", 
    "8": "The behavioural responsiveness to picrotoxin and desipramine was investigated in adult rats prenatally exposed to different benzodiazepine receptor agonists such as diazepam, alprazolam and zolpidem. Prenatal exposure to diazepam and alprazolam similarly potentiated the anti-immobility effect on the forced swimming test and the inhibitory effect on spontaneous motor activity of picrotoxin and desipramine and increased the seizure sensitivity to picrotoxin. Prenatal zolpidem seems to be ineffective. These data suggest that, despite the differences in their pharmacodynamic profile, prenatal exposure to diazepam and alprazolam, but not zolpidem, may have similar permanent consequences on the behavioural effects of drugs acting on the GABAA receptors.", 
    "9": "The effect of DSP-4, a neurotoxin selectively affecting the projections of the locus coeruleus, upon exploratory behaviour of rats was studied in a complex exploration test, including a choice between open and enclosed areas and both inquisitive and inspective exploration elements. One week after DSP-4 (50 mg/kg i.p.) administration, the neurotoxin-treated rats did not explore a novel open area to any extent on the first exposure to the apparatus; however, on the third day of testing, these animals began to explore the area and the novel objects. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) treatment did not change the behaviour of control rats, but significantly increased the exploratory activity of the DSP-4-treated animals. LY 288513, a selective CCKB receptor antagonist (0.01 mg/kg), prevented the increase in exploratory activity in the DSP-4-treated rats, but increased the exploratory activity of controls on the third exposure to the test situation. The results of this investigation suggest that DSP-4 treatment reduces neotic behaviour by increasing neophobia rather than by decreasing exploratory drive. The divergence reported between the relative potencies of CCKB receptor antagonists in exploratory activity and other anxiety tests may in part be due to the effects of these drugs on exploratory drive.", 
    "10": "Although the clinical symptoms of severe depression are easily recognized, this is not always the case in minimal forms or in certain masked depressions. Failure to respond to appropriate treatment may then be taken to indicate the possible existence of specific and organic sleep disorders with clinical symptoms similar to those of depressive illness. Sleep disorders mainly comprise sleep apnea and periodic movement of the lower limbs. Diagnosis can only be confirmed by EPS before a specific treatment is selected : correct diagnosis of the disorder is essential, particularly for sleep apnea, since standard drug therapy for depression and anxiety disorders often includes benzodiazepines, which, through the depressant effect they exert on the respiratory centers, only worsen symptoms.", 
    "11": "1. In pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rabbits, the inhibitory effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists with different selectivity profiles were examined on carbachol-evoked submandibular secretion and urinary bladder contractions, and on parasympathetically nerve-evoked secretion. On isolated submandibular gland fragments, the inhibitory effects of the antagonists were studied on carbachol-evoked release of potassium and on the overflow of tritium in response to electrical field stimulation. 2. In vivo, 4-DAMP equipotently inhibited simultaneously carbachol-evoked submandibular secretory and contractile responses of the urinary bladder, while pirenzepine was found to be four times as potent in inhibiting the secretory response compared with the contractile response. 3. The inhibition of carbachol-evoked salivation caused by atropine, 4-DAMP and pirenzepine was as great as their inhibition of parasympathetic nerve-evoked salivation. Methoctramine exerted less inhibitory effect on nerve-evoked salivation than on carbachol-evoked, thus seemingly causing greater presynaptic inhibition. 4. In vitro, pirenzepine was only 30 times less potent in inhibiting carbachol-evoked potassium release than 4-DAMP (pA2, 9.58 vs 8.10). Whereas atropine, 4-DAMP and pirenzepine abolished the overflow of tritium from isolated glands in response to electrical field stimulation, methoctramine increased it. 5. It is concluded that the muscarinic secretory response in the rabbit submandibular gland is exerted via both muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors, while the contractile response of the urinary bladder to muscarinic agonists is exerted via muscarinic M3 receptors. The release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals in the gland can be inhibited via M2 autoreceptors in rabbits.", 
    "12": "1. The muscarinic receptor subtype mediating contraction of the canine saphenous vein has been characterized using a range of muscarinic agonists and subtype-selective antagonists. 2. Oxotremorine M and (+)-cis-dioxolane behaved as full agonists, while in comparison L-660,863 ((+/-)-3-(3-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazole-5-yl)quinuclidine) acted as a partial agonist. SDZ ENS 163 (thiopilocarpine), pilocarpine and McN-A-343 (0.1 microM-0.3 mM) did not elicit a response. The profile of agonist potencies suggests a low receptor reserve for contraction. 3. The rank order of antagonist apparent affinities was 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide; 8.41) > pirenzepine (8.10) > himbacine (7.34) > or = p-F-HHSiD (para-fluoro-hexahydrosiladifenidol; 7.15) > methoctramine (6.23). This antagonist apparent affinity profile is consistent with the activation of muscarinic M1 receptors.", 
    "13": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist beta-carboline FG 7142 on cortical ACh efflux were determined using in vivo microdialysis in freely-moving rats. Additionally, a within-subjects, repeated-dialysis experimental design (four microdialysis sessions; removable dialysis probe) was evaluated as a method for measuring changes in basal and FG 7142-stimulated ACh efflux in the frontoparietal cortex. FG 7142 (4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 mg/kg) produced a 150-470% increase in cortical ACh efflux, with a dose-dependent effect on the duration of the increase in efflux. Basal cortical ACh efflux was lower in session 4 than in session 1. However, the ability of FG 7142 to stimulate efflux was unchanged by repeated dialysis testing. The ability of tetrodotoxin (1.0 microM) to suppress both basal and FG 7142-stimulated ACh efflux was also unaffected by repeated dialysis testing. These results demonstrate that systemically administered benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists stimulate cortical ACh efflux, and that repeated-measures experimental designs can be valid for determining certain changes in cortical ACh efflux with in vivo microdialysis.", 
    "14": "The benzodiazepine site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABAA) receptor is the principle site of action for a number of structurally diverse compounds, including the beta-carbolines, many of which bind with high affinity. The apparent reversal of inhibition and potentiation by high concentrations of methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline (DMCM) and other beta-carbolines has been reported by several groups and is insensitive to the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. By using alpha 6-containing receptors, which have low affinity for benzodiazepines, we observed robust potentiation of GABAA responses by micromolar concentrations of DMCM and other beta-carbolines that is dependent on the beta subunit variant. The beta subunit-dependent potentiation by the anticonvulsant loreclezole is dependent on a single amino acid in the putative transmembrane 2 region. By using single point mutations that discriminate the loreclezole site, we show that potentiation by DMCM is also dependent on the presence of the same amino acid, Asn290, in beta 2 or beta 3 (serine in beta 1), providing evidence that the low affinity site for beta-carboline potentiation is the loreclezole site. The potentiation is independent of the alpha subunit and is more pronounced on alpha 6-containing receptors due to the lack of DMCM inhibition via the benzodiazepine site. In addition, the potentiation observed is competitive with that of loreclezole, and other beta-carbolines, such as ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, act in a similar manner. The finding that beta-carbolines can act via the loreclezole site as well as the benzodiazepine site suggests that a wider variety of compounds may act via this site and shows that compounds can interact with more than one modulatory site on the GABAA receptor.", 
    "15": "Thirty-six patients with panic disorder (PD) and 35 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) participated in an open alprazolam treatment phase that preceded controlled withdrawal from alprazolam. Clinical ratings, blood pressure and heart rate were obtained along with plasma measurements of cortisol, ACTH, growth hormone and catecholamines. A similar clinical response profile was evident in both groups with rapid onset of improvement within the first week. The two diagnostic groups differed in their biological response to alprazolam. PD patients had a significant reduction in blood pressure, plasma cortisol and a trend toward significant reduction in plasma epinephrine, which were not seen in the GAD patients. GAD patients showed a significant reduction in plasma norepinephrine. These findings provide further evidence that PD and GAD are biologically distinct syndromes.", 
    "16": "Cationic amphiphilic drugs strongly accumulate in tissues of different organs. Uptake is controlled by two major mechanisms, non-specific binding to membrane phospholipids, and ion-trapping within acidic cellular compartments. The aim of this study was to assess the individual contributions of these two mechanisms on the uptake in vitro of desipramine and chloroquine into tissue slices of control and desipramine-treated rats. Drug uptake into intact slices was compared with uptake into slices with destroyed or non-functional acidic compartments. The sequence of desipramine uptake by tissue slices of eight different organs was: lungs > brain > heart > diaphragm > kidneys > skeletal muscles > adipose tissue > liver. The low desipramine concentration in liver may be due to metabolism of the parent drug by cytochrome P-450. Uptake of chloroquine differed widely between slices of different organs with the sequence: lungs > kidneys = brain = liver > diaphragm = heart = skeletal muscles > adipose tissue. Destruction or inactivation of the acidic compartments by homogenization and freeze-thawing or by ammonium chloride, sodium fluoride, or monensin, reduced drug uptake to similar extents. The reduction was organ-specific and may represent the size of the lysosomal compartment in the respective tissue cells. Uptake of chloroquine was more affected than that of desipramine, suggesting that ion-trapping is the main factor for chloroquine accumulation, while binding to membrane phospholipids, is the main factor for desipramine uptake. Single or multiple-dose treatments of rats with desipramine hardly had any effect on consecutive desipramine uptake into lung and liver slices, while the accumulation of chloroquine was enhanced in these slices. In conclusion, the extent of uptake of cationic amphiphilic drugs into tissue slices was tissue-specific, and the contribution of the two uptake mechanisms was strongly drug-dependent.", 
    "17": "In the present study, the effect of cholecystokinin agonists and antagonists on dependence to morphine in mice has been investigated. Mice were treated subcutaneously with morphine (50, 50 and 75 mg/kg) three times daily for 2-4 days, and a last dose of morphine (50 mg/kg) was administered on day 3, 4 or 5. Withdrawal syndrome (jumping) was precipitated by naloxone (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) which was administered intraperitoneally 2 hr after the last dose of morphine. To study the effects of cholecystokinin receptor agonists or antagonists, 10 injection of morphine (3 administrations each day) for dependence and a dose of 5 mg/kg of naloxone for withdrawal induction were employed. Cholecystokinin-8 (0.001-0.01 mg/kg), low doses of the cholecystokinin agonists caerulein (0.00001 and 0.0001 mg/kg) and, unsulfated cholecystokinin (but not high doses) as well as the antagonists MK-329 (0.5-1 mg/kg) and L-365,260 (0.5-1 mg/kg) elicit reduction of the nalaxone-induced jumping. The inhibition of jumping induced by caerulein was reduced with the selective cholecystokinin antagonists MK-329 and L-365,260. It is concluded that cholecystokinin mechanism(s) may be involved in morphine dependence, that the agonists may act on a presynaptic receptors and that the antagonists may work on postsynaptic receptors.", 
    "18": "The effect of melatonin (5 mg, p.o.) on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during sleep was investigated in eight men in a placebo-controlled cross-over design. Melatonin was administered immediately prior to a 4-h daytime sleep episode (13-17 h) after a partial sleep deprivation. The non-REM sleep stages and REM sleep duration were not significantly affected. Melatonin enhanced EEG power density in non-REM sleep in the 13.75-14.0 Hz bin (i.e., within the frequency range of sleep spindles), and reduced activity in the 15.25-16.5 Hz band. In the first 2 h spectral values within the 2.25-5.0 Hz range were reduced. These changes in the EEG are to some extent similar to those induced by benzodiazepine hypnotics and to the contribution of the endogenous circadian pacemaker to the spectral composition of the sleep EEG when sleep occurs at night.",

    "24": "New technology is emerging that permits the chemical synthesis of large numbers of different compounds simultaneously. Combinatorial chemistry is heavily dependent upon the adaptation of organic synthesis to solid supports and has necessitated the development of appropriate analytical and chemical approaches to both monitor solid-phase reactions and release finished compounds into solution. Considerable progress has recently been made in all of these areas. Small-molecule libraries of medicinally important chemical classes, such as 1,4-benzodiazepines, mercaptopropionyl amino acids, and peptidyl phosphonates, have recently been reported. Encoded combinatorial libraries of dihydrobenzopyran-based and acylpiperidine-based pharmacophores have yielded potent inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase. Automated instrumentation is growing in importance for the synthesis of small-molecule libraries.", 
    "25": "A genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed for the superimposition of sets of flexible molecules. Molecules are represented by a chromosome that encodes angles of rotation about flexible bonds and mappings between hydrogen-bond donor proton, acceptor lone pair and ring centre features in pairs of molecules. The molecule with the smallest number of features in the data set is used as a template, onto which the remaining molecules are fitted with the objective of maximising structural equivalences. The fitness function of the GA is a weighted combination of: (i) the number and the similarity of the features that have been overlaid in this way; (ii) the volume integral of the overlay; and (iii) the van der Waals energy of the molecular conformations defined by the torsion angles encoded in the chromosomes. The algorithm has been applied to a number of pharmacophore elucidation problems, i.e., angiotensin II receptor antagonists, Leu-enkephalin and a hybrid morphine molecule, 5-HT1D agonists, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, 5-HT3 antagonists, dopamine D2 antagonists, dopamine reuptake blockers and FKBP12 ligands. The resulting pharmacophores are generated rapidly and are in good agreement with those derived from alternative means.", 
    "26": "The Mouse Defense Test Battery (MDTB) has been designed to investigate defensive responses of Swiss-Webster mice confronted with a natural predator, a rat. These behaviors include flight, avoidance, defensive threat/attack responses, and risk assessment activities. Previous studies with the MDTB have suggested that this model may have some utility for the investigation of panicogenic and antipanic compounds. In the present study the MDTB was used to investigate the effects of acute (0.05-1 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min) or chronic (0.5-2 mg/kg, one daily i.p. injection during 10 days) treatment with the benzodiazepine receptor (BZPR) full agonist and panicolytic agent alprazolam. At non motor-impairing doses (0.05-0.5 mg/kg), acute alprazolam failed to alter the avoidance distance between the subject and the predator, the number of avoidances when the rat is approaching, predator assessment activities, defensive threat/attack responses when contact is forced between the subject and the predator or contextual escape attempts after the predator was removed. This was in contrast to chronic treatment which decreased both avoidance variables at 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, defensive threat/attack responses at all doses, and predator assessment responses at 0.5 mg/kg. In addition, the latter treatment reduced post-predator potentiation of escape attempts at 2 mg/kg. These results (1) confirm previous findings with the BZPR full agonist chlordiazepoxide, indicating that these compounds generally attenuate antipredator defensive responses in Swiss-Webster mice; (2) support recent data indicating that panic-altering drugs modulate flight/escape reactions, and suggest that the primary mechanism of action of drugs with efficacy against panic disorder may involve neural systems controlling flight; (3) confirm that the MDTB may be useful for the investigation of panicolytic as well as anxiolytic agents.", 
    "27": "The modulatory effects of taurine on [35S]-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to rat brain synaptic membranes were evaluated and compared with that of GABA. Taurine allosterically inhibited TBPS binding by interacting with a bicuculline-sensitive site, similar to GABA. Taurine was as effective as GABA but less potent. The potency of taurine inhibition of TBPS binding varied among brain regions with cerebellum > olfactory bulb > cortex, similar to that of GABA. Inhibition of TBPS binding to cortical membranes measured under nonequilibrium conditions yielded a dynamic biphasic inhibition curve that was similarly shaped for GABA and taurine. The effect of taurine on TBPS binding was pharmacologically specific in that beta-alanine and guanadinoethanesulfonate were as effective as taurine, while hypotaurine and alpha-aminoethylhydrogen sulfate were only partially effective at high concentrations, and isethionic acid was without effect. Taurine, similar to GABA, enhanced the effects of pentobarbital on TBPS binding when present at concentrations that were otherwise ineffective on their own. The results of these studies support the notion that taurine interacts with the GABA recognition site of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "28": "Symptoms of panic attack can be found in both medical disease and mental disorder. At least 4 of 13 diagnostic symptoms need to be present to constitute an attack which onset is sudden and unpredictable. The duration of attack usually lasts minutes but sometimes longer. In panic disorder there is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety which are unprovoked and unexpected. Dominant symptoms vary from person to person. The syndrome is likely to be heterogeneous as the biological aetiology may be related to abnormalities in the function of a number of neurotransmitters ie serotonin, noradrenaline, gamabutyric acid, dopamine and cholecystokinin. As such different benzodiazepines and anti-depressants are efficacious in the treatment of the disorder. Medications should be titrated to prevent attacks and restore confidence. Maintenance therapy needs to be balanced with premature termination of treatment. Reassurance is important and there is a place for cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation exercise and breathing control technique.", 
    "29": "Ethanol has pharmacological profile very similar to benzodiazepines which facilitate GABA-ergic neurotransmission. In addition, a lot of ethanol-induced effects are partially antagonized by Ro 15-4513, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist. In our study, the influence of CGS 8216, another benzodiazepine inverse agonist, on the hypothermic (3.5 g/kg in mice, 3.0 g/kg in rats) and disturbing the motor coordination (3.2 g/kg in mice, 2.5 g/kg in rats, aerial righting reflex) effects of ethanol was investigated. The hypothermic effects of ethanol were antagonized in mice, and significantly attenuated in rats by CGS 8216 (10 and 20 mg/kg). Ethanol-induced motor incoordination was significantly diminished by 10 and 20 mg/kg of CGS 8216 in mice but not in rats. These data suggest that some effects of ethanol may result from the intensification of benzodiazepine/GABA-ergic activity. In addition, they let us presume that the activity of CGS 8216 is connected with a benzodiazepine receptor named BZ-1 or omega 1. The results indicate the need of further work on the benzodiazepine inverse agonists for use in treatment of ethanol poisoning.", 
    "30": "In order to explore the effect of drugs on band 3 protein anion transport function and its clinical significance, several common drugs such as furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, etc, were tested. The results demonstrated that furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide and valium could inhibit rapidly and reversibly the anion transport function of band 3 protein and led to HCO-3/Cl- exchange restriction. The mechanism of action of the drugs was thought to be an interaction between drugs and the two sites of band 3 protein anion transport system. The reason that pulmonary encephalopathy was induced by diuretics and sedatives may be related to the inhibition of anion transport by the drugs and reduced CO2 elimination. It was necessary to be careful in using these drugs in patients with impaired lung function, especially the patients of cor pulmonale with type II respiratory failure.", 
    "31": "The positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission CT (SPECT) revealed the pathophysiology of ischemic brain in the transaxial images. There are several limitations in PET studies by continuous inhalation method using oxygen-15 labeled gases. There has been a suspicion about the constancy between the red cell volume and plasma volume in the ischemic brain. We measured plasma volume by PET using Cu-62 labeled human serum albumin in cases of internal carotid artery occlusion. There was no remarkable plasma volume alterations between the ischemic and non-ischemic hemisphere. Powers et al demonstrated the relationships between the intracranial perfusion pressure changes and vascular or metabolic adaptations. The important issue in acute stage of stroke is to differentiate the truly alive and completely destroyed tissue. Cerebral blood flow change might be affected during acute stage by diaschisis. Recent examination using benzodiazepine receptor imaging by SPECT might have a potential to depict the damaged tissues, because cortical neuronal cell bodies have a lot of the receptors and an ischemic insult induces the loss of the receptors. The relationship of crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion (CCH) and supratentorial circulatory conditions is attractive, because supratentorial hypometabolism of oxygen induced more severe CCH in internal carotid artery occlusion. Therefore, we can predict the supratentorial oxygen metabolism by CCH in a case of internal artery occlusion. We have a lots of tools to explore the pathophysiological states of ischemic brain. These must be dedicated to develop the more effective therapeutic procedures.", 
    "32": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is known to inhibit the electrical and secretory activity of oxytocin and vasopressin neurones located in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei following osmotic, cardiovascular or suckling stimuli. To understand fully the nature of GABA actions on these magnocellular neurones it is important to define the heteropentameric GABAA receptor proteins they express. In the present study, single and dual labelling in situ hybridisation and immunocytochemical experiments were undertaken to define the GABAA receptor gamma subunits expressed by these cells. In situ hybridisation with 35S-labelled antisense oligonucleotides showed that all magnocellular neurones in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the female rat expressed mRNA encoding the gamma 2 subunit of the GABAA receptor but not the gamma 1 or gamma 3 subunits. Immunocytochemical experiments using a specific polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the gamma 2 subunit of the GABAA receptor showed that all hypothalamic magnocellular neurones were strongly immunoreactive for gamma 2 subunit protein. Dual in situ hybridisation experiments using the gamma 2 subunit 35 S-labelled oligonucleotide with alkaline phosphatase-labelled antisense oligonucleotides specific for either oxytocin or vasopressin revealed that essentially all oxytocin and vasopressin neurones in both the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei expressed the gamma 2 subunit of the GABAA receptor. Similarly, sequential double immunoperoxidase staining revealed that all oxytocin and vasopressin neurones in both magnocellular nuclei of the hypothalamus were immunoreactive for the gamma 2 subunit. This study shows that only the gamma 2 subunit of the GABAA receptor gamma subunit family is expressed by hypothalamic oxytocin and vasopressin neurones. In conjunction with our previous results, these findings indicate that individual magnocellular neurones express a complement of alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 2, beta 3 and gamma 2 subunits of the GABAA receptor. The observation of strong gamma 2 subunit expression by neurones known to also express alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunit proteins suggests that these magnocellular cells may express GABAA receptors with both benzodiazepine type-1 and type-2 pharmacology.", 
    "33": "Paralytic ileus of the small bowel was diagnosed in a fetus at 32 weeks' gestation after referral because of polyhydramnios. The mother had taken clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, and carbamazepine during the entire pregnancy for epilepsy. All known causes for the ileus were ruled out and at 20 months the boy has developed normally. We conclude that maternal anticonvulsant drug intake was very likely the cause of the paralytic ileus. This side-effect is known in experimental and clinical pharmacology but has not yet been described in human fetuses.", 
    "34": "A selective and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of midazolam and its unconjugated 1-hydroxy metabolite in plasma samples was developed. The compounds were extracted from plasma by a liquid-liquid extraction procedure with diethyl ether. Mean analytical recoveries were 87% and 86% at a concentration of 300 ng/ml for midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam, respectively, and the quantification limit was 2 ng/ml for a plasma volume of 1 ml. The separation of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and flurazepam (internal standard) was achieved on a Spherisorb 5 CN column using methanol-2(r)propanol (75:25, v/v) containing 0.015% perchloric acid at a flow-rate of 1.5 ml/min. The method is sensitive enough for monitoring midazolam and also the unconjugated form of the active metabolite in plasma during pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "35": "This study was conducted to determine the potential for an interaction between nefazodone (NEF), a new antidepressant, and lorazepam (LOR) after single- and multiple-dose administration in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in healthy male volunteers. A total of 12 subjects per group received either placebo (PLA) twice daily, 2 mg of LOR twice daily, 200 mg of NEF twice daily, or the combination of 2 mg of LOR and 200 mg of NEF (LOR+NEF) twice daily for 7 days. Plasma samples were collected after dosing on day 1 and day 7 and before the morning dose on days 4, 5, and 6 for the determination of LOR, NEF, and NEF metabolites hydroxy (HO)-NEF, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and dione by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Steady-state levels in plasma were reached by day 4 for LOR, NEF, HO-NEF, mCPP, and dione. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there was no effect of LOR on the single dose or steady-state pharmacokinetics of NEF, HO-NEF, or dione after coadministration. The steady-state mCPP Cmax values decreased 36% for the LOR+NEF group in comparison to that when NEF was given alone. There was no effect of NEF on the pharmacokinetics of LOR after coadministration. The absence of an interaction appears to be attributable to LOR's metabolic clearance being dependant on conjugation rather than hydroxylation. Overall, no change in LOR or NEF dosage is necessary when the two drugs are coadministered.", 
    "36": "This study was conducted to determine the potential for an interaction between nefazodone, a new antidepressant, and alprazolam after single- and multiple-dose administration in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in 48 healthy male volunteers. A group of 12 subjects received either placebo twice daily, 1 mg of alprazolam twice daily, 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily, or the combination of 1 mg of alprazolam and 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected after dosing on day 1 and day 7 and before the morning dose on days 4, 5, and 6 for the determination of alprazolam and its metabolites alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (AOH) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4OH) and nefazodone and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-nefazodone), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and a triazole dione metabolite (dione) by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Steady-state levels in plasma were reached by day 4 for alprazolam, 4OH, nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, mCPP, and dione. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that at steady state, alprazolam Cmax and AUCtau values significantly increased approximately twofold and 4OH Cmax and AUCtau values significantly decreased by 40 and 26%, respectively, when nefazodone was coadministered with alprazolam. There was no effect of alprazolam on the single-dose or steady-state pharmacokinetics of nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, or dione after the coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone. However, the mean steady-state mCPP Cmax and AUCtau significantly increased by approximately threefold and t1/2 values significantly increased by approximately twofold after the coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone in comparison to those when nefazodone was given alone. Competitive inhibition between alprazolam and nefazodone metabolism at cytochrome P450 3A4 may be responsible for the pharmacokinetic interaction when alprazolam and nefazodone were coadministered. No adjustment of nefazodone dosage is required when nefazodone and alprazolam are coadministered. Because alprazolam concentrations in plasma are increased in the presence of nefazodone, a reduction in alprazolam dosage is recommended when the two agents are coadministered.", 
    "37": "Recent advances in molecular pharmacology have allowed the characterization of the specific isoforms that mediate the metabolism of various medications. This information can be integrated with older clinical observations to begin to develop specific mechanistic and predictive models of psychotropic drug interactions. The polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 has gained much attention, because competition for this isoform is responsible for serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced increases in tricyclic antidepressant concentrations in plasma. However, the cytochrome P450 3A subfamily and the 3A3 and 3A4 isoforms (CYP3A3/4) in particular are becoming increasingly important in psychopharmacology as a result of their central involvement in the metabolism of a wide range of steroids and medications, including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, and carbamazepine. The inhibition of CYP3A3/4 by medications such as certain newer antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, and antibiotics can increase the concentrations of CYP3A3/4 substrates, yielding toxicity. The induction of CYP3A3/4 by medications such as carbamazepine can decrease the concentrations of CYP3A3/4 substrates, yielding inefficiency. Thus, knowledge of the substrates, inhibitors, and inducers of CYP3A3/ and other cytochrome P450 isoforms may help clinicians to anticipate and avoid pharmacokinetic drug interactions and improve rational prescribing practices.", 
    "38": "Eighteen males performed two vigilance tasks with static and dynamic stimuli under the influence of oxazepam (20 and 40 mg) in a placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover design. Oxazepam dose-dependently impaired overall level of performance and aggravated the decrement with time in measures of accuracy and sensitivity relative to placebo. The drug reduced the amplitudes of the P1, N1, P2N2, and P3 (dose-dependently) waves of event-related potentials (ERPs). Oxazepam aggravated the linear decline with time of the P3 amplitude only. Oxazepam impaired accuracy was related to deterioration of central processing involved in stimulus discrimination (P2N2). Impairment of response-related performance measures (RT and RI) was associated with processing manifest in the P1, N1, and P3 waves. Oxazepam effects on the amplitudes of N1 and P3 correlated with drug effects on power in alpha 1 (8-10 Hz). Drug effects on overall performance and alpha were also related; the drug effect on response speed correlated only with the drug effect on beta 1 (12.5-21 Hz). Effects of time-on-task on performance and EEG were unrelated, but oxazepam induced performance declines with time may have been caused by declines in resource allocation, as manifest in the amplitude of P3. Time effects on EEG power bands and ERP amplitudes were not significantly related to the time course of oxazepam activity. A curious dissociation emerged: both oxazepam and time-on-task impaired performance, but the drug induced a decrease of theta and alpha 1 power, whereas time-on-task increased power. Various processes play a role in performance decrements with time, and various aspects of processing may be involved in signal-detection measures which makes terms such as sensitivity quite meaningless. So-called computational processing was indistinguishable from energetic processes, which questions the validity of the distinction between these two domains. Explanations of EEG activity in terms of a unidimensional theory of arousal are untenable.", 
    "39": "The purpose of the present study was to further investigate the relationship between the DS effects of PB and those of benzodiazepines (BZs) and to begin to collect pharmacological information concerning receptor mechanisms involved in this behavioral effect of BZs. Rhesus monkeys (n = 3), trained to discriminate pentobarbital (PB; 10 mg/kg, IG) from saline under a discrete-trials shock avoidance procedure, were given IG diazepam (0.3-10 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (1.0-30 mg/kg), or etizolam (0.3-10 mg/kg) alone and in combination with flumazenil (0.01-1.7 mg/kg, IM). Flumazenil was administered 10 min prior to the administration of saline, PB or the BZs. All three BZs fully substituted for PB in all monkeys. Diazepam was the most potent with a mean ED50 of 0.81 mg/kg (SEM = 0.04) while chlordiazepoxide was the least potent (mean ED50 = 5.78 mg/kg, SEM = 1.22 mg/kg). The ED50 for etizolam was 1.22 mg/kg (SEM = 0.37 mg/kg). Pretreatment with flumazenil (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) resulted in a dose-related parallel shift to the right in the dose-response function for PB-appropriate responding in all monkeys for all three BZs. The mean (n = 3) pKB value with 0.1 mg/kg flumazenil was 6.51 (SEM = 0.42) for diazepam and 6.57 (SEM = 0.17) for chlordiazepoxide. This value could not be calculated for etizolam because only one monkey was tested with 0.1 mg/kg flumazenil. However, the mean pKB for etizolam considering all monkeys and all doses of flumazenil was 6.58 (SEM = 0.47). Apparent pA2 values for flumazenil with diazepam were 6.02 for one monkey and 7.11 for another. All three BZs tended to increase average latency to respond. Apparent pKB and pA2 analysis may prove useful for elucidating receptor mechanisms involved in the behavioral effects of BZs.", 
    "40": "It seems that psychopharmacology may be well on its way toward the goal of developing new anxiolytic drug(s) that are fast acting and free from the unwanted effects associated with the traditional benzodiazepines. Several specific candidates exist, based upon rational targeting of neurotransmitter receptors shown to be linked to the neurobiology of anxiety. Thus, partial agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor, such as alpidem, abecarnil, and bretazenil, have highly promising preclinical profiles, and some useful preliminary results in clinical testing of anxiety disorder subjects. Neurosteroids are another interesting set of pharmacologic agents that target the benzodiazepine receptor, have a preclinical anxiolytic profile, and now need to be tested in clinical populations. Targeting of various serotonin (5HT) receptor subtypes is a very active area of current research for novel anxiolytic agents. 5HT3 antagonists may have an anxiolytic profile, but clinical results are still preliminary and need more validation. Of considerable interest is the idea of developing new drugs that act at 5HT1A, 5HT2A, or 5HT2C receptors. It has even been proposed that simultaneous targeting of both 5HT2A and 5HT1A receptors could result in robust anxiolytic agents that will have more immediate onset of action than currently available 5HT1A receptor acting drugs. Neuropeptide receptor agonists and antagonists with anxiolytic properties may represent one of the most striking new classes of potential anxiolytic drugs, but this is an emerging field that still requires considerably more systematic clinical testing. Nevertheless, preclinical studies as well as early clinical studies suggest that at least three neuropeptide receptors are provocative targets for novel anxiolytic agents: namely antagonists for CCK-B receptors, antagonists for CRF receptors, and agonists for neuropeptide Y receptors. Rational development of new pharmacologic agents based upon targeting receptors for those neurotransmitters that regulate the neurobiology of anxiety promises to bring forth a number of exciting therapeutic agents for the treatment of anxiety disorders in the future.", 
    "41": "Despite increasing research interest in the area of anxiety in younger age groups, few systematic studies of the course and treatment of anxiety disorders in the elderly have been performed. Data from Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) studies suggest that anxiety disorders remain among the most prevalent of all psychiatric disorders in this age group. There is little information available about the late onset of anxiety disorders except for some evidence regarding panic disorder that suggests a distinct subtype with late onset and differences in vulnerability factors and phenomenology. Any evaluation of anxiety in the elderly should take into account multiple medical illnesses and medications that can produce a similar symptom picture. Thus, the importance of good history-taking, empathy to the patient's psychosocial situation, and awareness of the possibility of an underlying medical condition cannot be overemphasized. A variety of compounds including benzodiazepines, buspirone, antidepressants, and beta blockers seems to show effectiveness for various anxiety disorders of the elderly. One needs to be cognizant of the great individual variation among the elderly and should be ready and willing to tailor usage of medications or cognitive-behavioral techniques to the patient's special needs. Proper education of the patient, leading to better compliance with the treatment regimen, and recent advances in treatment will almost certainly improve the outlook for these patients in the future for better functioning and a more optimistic prognosis.", 
    "42": "A comprehensive model is developed to describe the swelling/dissolution behaviors and drug release from hydrophilic matrices. The major thrust of this model is to employ an important physical property of the polymer, the polymer disentanglement concentration, rho p,dis, the polymer concentration below which polymer chains detach off the gelled matrix. For (hydroxypropyl)methylcellulose (HPMC) in water, we estimate that rho p,dis scales with HPMC molecular weight, M, as rho p,dis varies M-0.8. Further, matrix dissolution is considered similar to the dissolution of an object immersed in a fluid. As a result, a diffusion layer separating the matrix from the bulk solution is incorporated into the transport regime. An anisotropic expansion model is also introduced to account for the anisotropic expansion of the matrix where surface area in the radial direction dominates over the axial surface area. The model predicts that the overall tablet size and the characteristic swelling time correlate with rho p,dis qualitatively. Two scaling laws are established for fractional polymer (mp(t)/mp(infinity)) and drug (md(t)/md(infinity)) released as mp(t)/mp(infinity) varies M-1.05 and md(t)/md(infinity) varies M-0.24, consistent with the limiting polymer molecular weight effect on drug release. Model predictions for polymer and drug release agree well with observations, within 15% error. Evolution of water concentration profiles and the detailed structure of a swollen matrix are discussed.", 
    "43": "Two scaling laws for predicting polymer and drug release profiles from hydrophilic matrices were developed. They were developed on the basis of the diffusion layer and the polymer disentanglement concentration, rho p,dis, the critical polymer concentration below which polymer chains detach off a gelled matrix that is undergoing simultaneous swelling and dissolution. The relation between rho p,dis and molecular weight, M1 for (hydroxypropyl)methylcellulose (HPMC) in water was established as rho p,dis (g/mL) varies M-0.8. This power-law relationship for rho p,dis, along with the diffusion layer adjacent to the gelled matrix, leads to the scaling law of mp(t)/mp(infinity) varies Meq-1.15, where mp(t)/mp(infinity) is the fractional HPMC release. The scaling law explains the observation that polymer and drug release rates decreased sharply with M at low M and approach limiting values at high M. Experimentally, mp(t)/mp(infinity) was found to scale with Meq as mp(t)/mp(infinity) varies Meq-0.93, where Meq is the equivalent matrix molecular weight. Moreover, fractional drug release, md(t)/md(infinity), followed Meq as md(t)/md(infinity) varies Meq-0.48. These two scaling laws imply that, if the release profiles are known for one composition, release profiles for other compositions can be predicted. The above two power laws lead to two master curves for mp(t)/mp(infinity) and md(t)/md(infinity), suggesting that the release mechanism for soluble drugs from HPMC matrices is independent of matrix compositions, presumably via a diffusion-controlled process. Limitations of the power laws are discussed.", 
    "44": "Vibration perception was quantitatively examined in 92 healthy volunteers (46 females, 36 males, aged 10-71 years). Vibration perception thresholds, vibration disappearance thresholds and vibration thresholds were assessed at the second metacarpal bone, styloid process of ulna, lateral epicondyle of humerus, first phalanx of the big toe, first metatarsal bone, medial malleolus and proximal part of the tibia bilaterally. Vibration sensitivity was found to be age-dependent. Under the age of 60, the correlation was linear. Vibration thresholds depended on body site but they were not related to sex or body side. Temperature and diazepam affect the perception of vibration considerably. Small interindividual variability was found in measurements repeated in 3 consecutive days, after 4 weeks and after a year.", 
    "45": "Previous reports have suggested a role played by peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBZ) in the regulation of calcium. The aid of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of Ro 5-4864 (PBZ agonist) and PK11195 (PBZ antagonist) in guinea pig trachea and their possible role in the regulation of calcium. Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 showed spasmolytic effects on the contraction curve induced by acetylcholine. Moreover, Ro 5-4864, PK 11195 and diltiazem (a Ca2+ -antagonistic drug) shifted to the right the contraction curves induced by acetylcholine, potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2), or by Bay K 8644. These results demonstrate that the benzodiazepines and their antagonists may exhibit Ca2+ -antagonistic activity. Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 may exert this effect at a site that is a component of, or is associated with, voltage operated calcium channels (VOC).", 
    "46": "We report the results of a representative survey in Lower Saxony, Germany, that focused on the treatment of sleep disturbances in the moderately demented elderly. Two written sample case histories (vignettes) described either a vascular demented patient suffering from nocturnal wandering or an Alzheimer's-type demented patient without apparent psychotic or behavioral (sleep) disorder. These were randomly assigned and presented to 145 family physicians and 14 neuropsychiatrists working in private practice by a trained investigator, who then conducted a standardized interview with the physicians. The study was representative of physicians (response rate: 83.2%). In response to the question concerning how they would treat the patient's sleep disturbances, about 20% of the physicians (with respect to both versions) answered that they would not choose drugs. More than 40% considered neuroleptics to be the drugs of choice. Benzodiazepines, antidepressants and other substances were seldom considered. No significant difference was noted in the response to the two different case histories. The results allow for the conclusion that non-drug treatments, which (at least initially) should be the treatment of choice, are mainly disregarded by the majority of the ambulatory care physicians. The reason for this seems to be a lack of education in sleep medicine and also in geriatric medicine.",

There was no marked difference between the two groups in fetal arterial blood gas and acidbase status. However, the rates of respiratory depression and muscle tone inhibition in the neonates of study groups (63.3% and 26.7% respectively) were significantly higher than those in the control group (30% and 3.3% respectively) (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).",

    "51": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes mediating catecholamine secretion and increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were examined using muscarinic agonists and antagonists in dispersed adrenal chromaffin cells of the guinea pig. All muscarinic agonists (1-1,000 microM) tested caused increases in adrenaline secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Muscarine and methacholine were more effective than bethanechol, oxotremorine and pilocarpine. Muscarine and oxotremorine caused a small increase in adrenaline secretion even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Both 4-DAMP (0.1 microM) and pirenzepine (0.1 microM), but not methoctramine (0.1 microM), shifted the dose-response curve for muscarine-induced adrenaline secretion to the right. These muscarinic agonists also caused increase in [Ca2+]i in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Muscarine-induced [Ca2+]i rises were reduced, but not abolished, by removal of extracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that catecholamine secretion induced by muscarinic agonists is mediated through M1, or M1 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes in adrenal chromaffin cells of the guinea pig.", 
    "52": "Depending on their mechanism of action, anticonvulsant drugs in clinical use may be divided into three groups: those drugs which facilitate gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission; those which block neuronal ion channels; and those whose mechanism of action is unresolved. The compounds acting on GABAergic systems may be further subdivided into those which modulate transmission through chloride channels, e.g. the barbiturates and the benzodiazepines; those compounds, in particular vigabatrin, which reduce the degradation of GABA by blocking GABA transaminase; and those which inhibit the re-uptake of GABA into the presynaptic terminal. The other group of compounds whose mechanism of action is known are those which block neuronal ion channels. Blockage of voltage-operated sodium channels by lamotrigine, phenytoin or carbamazepine leads to decreased electrical activity and, probably, a subsequent reduction in glutamate release. Conversely, ethosuximide, blocks voltage-operated calcium channels, especially those which mediate calcium currents in thalamic neurones. Of those drugs in which the mechanism of action is unknown, sodium valproate is the prime example. An antagonistic action at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor might also be a possibility, which could be the case with some of the newer compounds currently undergoing evaluation.", 
    "53": "Recent studies on the effects of intrafloccular injections of muscarinic agonists and antagonists on compensatory eye movements in rabbit, indicate that muscarinic receptors may play a modulatory role in the rabbit cerebellar circuitry. It was previously demonstrated by Neustadt et al. (1988), that muscarinic receptors in rabbit cerebellar cortex are distributed into alternating longitudinal zones of very high and very low receptor density. In the present study, the zonal and cellular distribution of muscarinic receptors in the rabbit cerebellar cortex is investigated in detail using in vitro ligand autoradiography with the non-selective high-affinity antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), and the M2-specific antagonist [3H]AF-DX384, and immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody specific for the cloned m2 muscarinic receptor protein. [3H]QNB and [3H]AF-DX384 binding sites and m2-immunoreactivity had similar overall distributions: dense labeling occurred in the dendritic arbors of a subset of Purkinje cells that are organized into parasagittal bands. A high level of muscarinic receptor labeling was also observed in a thin substratum of the molecular layer immediately above the Purkinje cell layer of the vestibulo-cerebellar lobules, i.e. the nodulus, the ventral uvula and the flocculus. Labeling in this stratum was associated with densely packed fibres, which were putatively identified as parallel fibres. Also Golgi cells, which were localized in part in the molecular layer, and a subset of mossy fibre rosettes, primarily concentrated in lobule VI, were immunoreactive for the m2 receptor. The parasagittal band of labeled Purkinje cell dendrites were most prominent in the anterior lobe (lobules I-V), in crus 1 and 2, in the flocculus, the ventral paraflocculus and the rostral folium of the nodulus. In other lobules, only infrequent Purkinje cells contained muscarinic receptors. The parasagittal organisation of muscarinic receptors differed from that of zebrin I, a Purkinje cell-specific protein which is often used as a marker of parasagittal parcelation of the cerebellar cortex. In the anterior lobe, however, there was a partial correspondence between muscarinic receptor and zebrin I bands. In the flocculus the distribution of muscarinic-receptor-positive Purkinje cells was related to the distinct white matter compartments as revealed with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry. Muscarinic receptor-containing Purkinje cells were located primarily in the floccular zone 1, which is implicated in the control of eye movements about a horizontal axis. In order to relate the distribution of muscarinic receptor labeling to that of cholinergic nerve terminals, [3H]QNB binding sites and sodium-dependent [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding were compared. Sodium-dependent [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding sites mainly occurred in the granule cell layer of the vestibulo-cerebellum, which corresponds well with the distribution of the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). However, sodium-dependent [3H]hemicholinium binding complemented, rather than co-localized with, muscarinic receptors which were primarily distributed in the molecular layer of the lobules of the vestibulo-cerebellar lobules. Their functional significance is puzzling, since their distribution does not correspond to that of markers of cholinergic innervation.",

Although neurological complications are few at onset and in the early hours, they are potential causes of death and morbidity. The main cause of death in the acute phase is cerebral edema. Early diagnosis and treatment, mainly with hyperosmolar agents, hyperventilation and/or surgery, can save lives and reduce the impact of sequelae. Early epileptic seizures are seen in 4-5% of stroke patients. Treatment is only needed in status epilepticus or recurrent episodes.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of four different prophylactic regimens on the duration of ICU stay, prevention of AWS and rate of major intercurrent complications in alcohol-dependent patients admitted to the ICU after tumour resection. A total of 197 alcohol-dependent patients, diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (third revised edition) with a daily ethanol intake of 60 g, were allocated randomly to one of the following regimens which were commenced on admission to the ICU: flunitrazepam-clonidine, chlormethiazole-haloperidol, flunitrazepam-haloperidol or ethanol. The duration of ICU stay, prevention of AWS, incidence of tracheobronchitis and major intercurrent complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac disorders, bleeding disorders and death were documented. On admission, patients did not differ significantly in age, APACHE II and multiple organ failure scores. ICU stay, incidence of AWS, severity of AWS (revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale > 20) and major intercurrent complication rate did not differ significantly between groups. Although there was no advantage in any of the four regimens with respect to the primary outcome measures, pulmonary and cardiac patients were not included in the study. Patients in the chlormethiazole-haloperidol group had a significantly increased incidence of tracheobronchitis (P = 0.0023), probably because of an increased incidence of hypersecretion.",

Immediately following induction blind gastric aspiration was performed using a 16Fr multiorificed orogastric tube. Gastric volume, pH, and cisapride blood concentration were measured at this time. Gastric volumes were significantly smaller in the cisapride group, 20.5 (SD 22.2) ml compared to placebo 28.2 (SD 26.0) ml but there was no significant difference with respect to pH. Some patients in both groups had large gastric volumes despite fasting. No significant adverse effects were noted with cisapride.", 
    "60": "Human eyeblink conditioning, a relatively simple form of learning and memory, has previously been shown to be impaired by the central and peripheral anticholinergic scopolamine. The present study compared the behavioral effects of scopolamine with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and a peripherally active anticholinergic, glycopyrrolate. Thirty-six healthy normal volunteers (mean age: 23.7 years) were studied with 12 assigned double-blind to each of three drug conditions (0.5 mg scopolamine IV, 2 mg lorazepam PO, or 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate IV). Subjects underwent classical conditioning of the eyeblink response in which the conditioned stimulus was an 80 dB binaural tone, and the unconditioned stimulus was a 2 psi airpuff to the right eye. Ten trials of unpaired stimulus presentations were followed by 60 paired trials and finally by an extinction period of five tone-alone presentations. An eyeblink response that occurred during the tone but before the airpuff was scored as a conditioned response (CR). Subjects treated with lorazepam (43% mean CRs) and scopolamine (51% mean CRs) exhibited a significantly lower asymptotic level of conditioning than those treated with glycopyrrolate (85% mean CRs; P < 0.01). However, during extinction, lorazepam-treated subjects (35% CRs) showed a lower overall level of responding to the tone than either scopolamine (60% CRs) or glycopyrrolate (62% CRs) treated subjects (P < 0.05). It seems unlikely that these differences could be accounted for by drug-induced alterations in motor responses because there were no significant differences between the three drug conditions in the frequency, latency, or amplitude of unconditioned responses to the airpuff. Overall, our data indicate that scopolamine and lorazepam impair eyeblink conditioning and suggest that some of the effects of benzodiazepines and anticholinergics on learning and memory can be differentiated using this paradigm.", 
    "61": "Sixty-three children under the age of 9 years were randomized to receive intravenous (group A, n = 33) or intranasal (group B, n = 30) midazolam as sedation for small bowel biopsy. Mean doses of midazolam given to produce adequate sedation were 0.31 mg (kg body weight)-1 in group A and 0.34 mg (kg body weight)-1 in group B (NS). Four children in group A and 10 children in group B required additional doses to maintain adequate sedation throughout the biopsy procedure (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the median procedure time (7 min in group A, 8.5 min in group B) or median fluoroscopy time (5 s in group A, 4 s in group B). All children in group B showed signs of discomfort from the nose when given midazolam intranasally. In conclusion, this study indicates that intravenous administration of midazolam is preferable to the intranasal route.",

    "63": "One hundred twenty-six patients with cancer receiving high dose cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and carmustine with autologous bone marrow support were randomized to receive one of four double-blinded antiemetic regimens: 4-day continuous infusion prochlorperazine (6 mg/m2 intravenous [i.v.] loading dose followed by 1.5 mg/m2/hour) or metoclopramide (80 mg/m2 iv loading dose followed by 20 mg/m2/hr) each with either dronabinol 5 mg/m2 or placebo capsules for two doses before carmustine on the last day of chemotherapy. All subjects received scheduled lorazepam and diphenhydramine throughout the 4-day study period. Efficacy was measured by the Emetic Process Rating Scale and the Rhodes Index of Nausea and Vomiting (INV) Form 2.", 
    "64": "One hundred six patients completed the study and were fully evaluable. The median number of emetic episodes on the metoclopramide study arm were: 1 (0-7, day -6), 1 (0-6, day -5), 2 (0-9, day -4), and 2 (0-10, with dronabinol day -3) or 2 (0-7, no dronabinol day -3) and on the prochlorperazine study arm were: 4 (0-12, day -6), 0 (0-8, day -5), 0 (0-12, day -4) and 2.5 (0-9, with dronabinol day -3) or 2 (0-12, no dronabinol day -3). Metoclopramide was significantly better on the first day of therapy (day -6, P < .002) and prochlorperazine was significantly better on the third day of therapy (day -4, P < 0.002). There was no significant difference among any of the four arms on the last day of chemotherapy (day -3), or when the median number of emetic episodes over the total study period were compared. The patients' assessment of nausea, vomiting, and retching on the INV Form 2 was consistent with the observer ratings. Toxicities requiring dose reduction or discontinuation of antiemetic drugs included diarrhea, cardiac arrhythmias, sedation, anxiety, and akathisia.",

    "66": "The hypothesis that the essential oil from Tagetes minuta L. can interact with biological membranes was investigated by assessing its ability of perturbing the binding of a benzodiazepine [flunitrazepam (FNTZ)] to crude members from chick brains. The essential oil from T. minuta L. inhibited [3H]FNTZ specific binding to chick brain members. These values were obtained from the analysis of the saturation curve for the kinetic parameters: dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) = 2.47 +/- 0.32 nM, maximal binding (Bmax) = 556 +/- 5 fmoles/mg protein, and Hill coefficient (n) = 1.00 +/- 0.07 in the absence, and Kd = 6.73 +/- 1.4 nM, Bmax = 583 +/- 69 fmoles/mg protein, and n = 1.02 +/- 0.08 in the presence of 29 microgram/mL of essential oil. The essential oil could self-aggregate with a critical micellar concentration (CMC) of 60 microgram/mL. The marked increase in [3H]FNTZ nonspecific binding starting at 60 micrograms of essence per mL was due to that phenomenon and revealed the ability of self-aggregated structures to interact with members. [3H]FNTZ specific binding decrement as a function of essence concentration cannot be ascribed merely to oil's micelles ability of trapping the lipophilic radioligand molecules, because the discontinuous behavior that characterizes a monomer-aggregate phase transition was not shown. Oil's components might behave as competitive inhibitors or allosteric modulators of FNTZ specific binding. However, their ability to increase FNTZ nonspecific binding at concentrations below oil's CMC suggests that this effect may be due to oil's partitioning into the lipid bilayer. This latter phenomenon would induce an increment in membrane fluidity and a change on FNTZ binding site toward a lower affinity conformation. Therefore, the essential oil components can interact with brain membranes either as monomers, by partitioning into the lipid bilayer, or as self-aggregated structures, through an adsorption to the membrane surface.", 
    "67": "The mammalian GABAA/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) receptor is comprised of several subunit isoforms: alpha 1-6, beta 1-13, gamma 1-3 and delta. In the present studies, the expression of alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunit mRNAs was examined in cerebellar Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar neurons of staggerer mutant mice during postnatal development. In control animals, the three subunit mRNAs were present at high density in Purkinje cells which, in adult animals, form a monolayer at the interface of the granule cell and molecular layers. The number of Purkinje cells in the staggerer cerebellar cortex is reduced; the majority of those that remain are retained within the granule cell layer and are unable to receive normal afferent synapses from granule cells. The three subunit mRNAs were ex pressed at similar levels in both staggerer and control Purkinje cells until postnatal day 9. After this time, although the alpha 1 subunit mRNA was maintained at control levels in staggerer Purkinje cells, the expression of beta 2 and gamma 2 subunit mRNAs decreased, and was largely absent by postnatal day 20. The loss of beta 2 and gamma 2 mRNA expression in staggerer was specific to Purkinje cells, since all three mRNAs were present throughout postnatal development in other brain regions, including the deep cerebellar nuclei. The present studies indicate that in cerebellar Purkinje cells, the GABAA/BZ receptor alpha 1, and beta 2, and gamma 2, subunit mRNAs are regulated by distinct mechanisms which are differentially affected by the staggerer mutation.", 
    "68": "A cross-over study was performed in 6 healthy mixed-breed dogs and 4 healthy Beagles. Diazepam was administered per rectum to Beagles (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) and mixed-breed dogs (2 mg/kg), and IV (0.5 mg/kg) to both groups of dogs. Each dog received the drug by both routes, with a 1-week washout period between dosages. After diazepam administration, blood samples were collected to measure plasma concentration of diazepam and its active metabolites, desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam, by use of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Systemic availability was assessed by comparing the area under the curve for diazepam metabolites for each route of administration. Mean (+/- SD) diazepam concentrations in plasma after rectal administration were low in comparison with those obtained after IV administration, with systemic availability of only 7.4 (+/- 5.9) and 2.7 (+/- 3.2)% for the high and low dose, respectively. However, diazepam was converted to its metabolites within minutes after administration. Accounting for the total concentration of benzodiazepines (diazepam plus desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam) in plasma, systemic availability was 79.9 (+/- 20.7) and 66.0 (+/- 23.8)% for the high and low dosage, respectively. After IV administration, diazepam concentration decreased, with a half-life of only 14 to 16 minutes, but desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam concentrations decreased more slowly, with a half-life of 2.2 to 2.8 hours and 3.5 to 5.1 hours, respectively. Each of the metabolites is reported to have anticonvulsant activity. After rectal administration of the high dose, mean total benzodiazepine concentration was above 1.0 microgram/ml within 10 minutes and was maintained above this concentration for at least 6 hours. We conclude that diazepam is absorbed after rectal administration in dogs, and that the pharmacologic effects are probably caused by the active metabolites, not the parent drug. Samples also were analyzed by use of a nonspecific commercial benzodiazepine fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). Correlation between the FPIA and HPLC assay was strongest for diazepam (R2 = 0.84), weak for desmethyldiazepam (R2 = 0.09), and nonexistent for oxazepam. We conclude from a comparison of assays that HPLC is preferred over the FPIA method for measuring benzodiazepines in dogs.",

A 23-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit 2 days after ingestion of 4-5 g M in an suicidal attempt. On admission he was somnolent and poorly responsive to painful stimuli. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 95 bpm, a blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, and a normal body temperature. His chest was clear to auscultation, respirations were shallow, and the skin was cyanotic. The electrocardiogram was unremarkable. The chest radiograph showed a normal heart size without pulmonary infiltrates or venous congestion. The pupils were dilated but reactive to light. The neurologic examination was further remarkable for increased limb reflexes, myoclonia, and positive pyramidal signs. During the next 2 days the patient became comatose and developed respiratory insufficiency due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, which was confirmed by chest radiograph and haemodynamic investigations by means of right heart catheterisation. He required mechanical ventilation for 6 days. Finally, he recovered completely and was discharged in good condition.",

    "73": "The presented case is the first report of a life-threatening intoxication after M ingestion primarily caused by Met-1. It supports the significance of this metabolite for the toxic effects of the drug. A toxicological screening test based on ELISA proved helpful due to its cross-reactivity with metabolites.

    "74": "To assess the importance of triglyceride digestion products in producing satiety, we determined the effects of duodenal infusions of triolein, oleic acid, and oleic acid plus monoolein on meal patterns in ad libitum-feeding rats. Oleic acid and oleic acid plus monoolein inhibited feeding similarly; triolein's effect was delayed and fourfold less potent. We then used the type A cholecystokinin (CCK-A)-receptor antagonist devazepide to assess the importance of CCK in mediating the anorexia produced by oleic acid. Oleic acid (at 320, 440, and 640 mumol/h) inhibited 3-h intake dose dependently by 32, 56, and 75%, respectively. Devazepide (1 or 2 mg/kg) blocked the responses to the 320 mumol/h dose, but had little if any effect on responses to the larger doses. Devazepide (1 mg/kg) did block anorexic responses to 3-h cholecystokinin octapeptide infusions (3 and 10 nmol.kg-1.h-1 iv) that inhibited 3-h intake by 25 and 65%, respectively. Our results suggest that the satiety response to triolein is produced by the products of triolein digestion and that CCK plays a significant, indispensable role in mediating the satiety response to duodenal delivery of small but not large loads of oleic acid.", 
    "75": "Opioids, benzodiazepines and hypnotics all affect central respiratory drive, muscular activity of the oropharynx, thoracic wall and diaphragm, bronchomotor tone and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and may thus influence respiratory function during sedation and weaning. Opioids and benzodiazepines will attenuate hypercapnic and hypoxic stimulation of the respiratory centres. Compromise of respiratory drive must also be anticipated with ketamine, in view of recent evidence contradicting earlier findings of central respiratory stimulation. Coordinated muscular activity of the oropharynx is important for airway patency. Since this mechanism is impaired more by benzodiazepines than by ketamine the latter may be advantageous during weaning. Respiratory frequency and tidal volume are both diminished by opioids, benzodiazepines and propofol. The differential impact on intercostal and diaphragmatic muscle activity may prove important in COPD and emphysema. With ketamine spontaneous respiration is increased. Gas distribution and airway pressures are influenced by bronchomotor tone. Bronchodilator effects are well known to arise with ketamine, but have also been demonstrated with benzodiazepines, propofol and some opioids. PVR is a critical factor in respiratory insufficiency. An increase in PVR with ketamine has been found during spontaneous respiration. Since evidence for pulmonary vasodilation during controlled ventilation has been recorded in humans and in vitro experiments, sedation regimens applied in respiratory insufficiency can also include ketamine.", 
    "76": "Cerebral blood flow autoregulation, CO2 reactivity and the pressure-volume relationship may be impaired or abolished in patients with intracranial mass lesions, brain trauma, cerebral vasospasm or increased cerebral elastance. Sedatives, analgetics, and anesthetics may induce major changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolism and intracranial pressure (ICP). The inadequate use of these drugs may aggravate the preexisting intracranial pathology and may worsen outcome. Thus it is important to understand the effects of sedatives, analgetics, and anaesthetics on intracranial hemodynamics and metabolism during physiological and pathological conditions. Hypnotics (barbiturates, etomidate, propofol), benzodiazepines, opioids (fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil) and alpha-2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine) reduce cerebral blood flow. With ketamine, cerebral blood flow changes in a regionally specific fashion, with some territories showing increases and others showing decreases in cerebral blood flow. Cerebral metabolism is decreased during sedation and analgesia with hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and opioids, while infusion of ketamine produces stimulation as well as suppression of cerebral metabolism. This suggests that the changes in cerebral blood flow seen with these drugs occur secondary to their cerebral, metabolic effects. Alpha-2-adrenergic agonists produce no significant changes in cerebral metabolism. However, cerebral blood flow is decreased with clonidine or dexmedetomidine. This suggests uncoupling between cerebral metabolism and flow due to decreases in central catecholamine turnover. Hypnotics and benzodiazepines decrease ICP due to decreases in cerebral blood volume. However, these drugs may also decrease mean arterial blood pressure, which may result in a critical reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure. ICP remains unchanged with the use of opioids as long as mean arterial pressure is maintained constant. However, decreases in mean arterial pressure during infusion of opioids induce autoregulatory cerebral vasodilation, which in turn increases cerebral blood volume and ICP. Ketamine may increase ICP specifically in subjects with spontaneous ventilation. With mechanical hyperventilation and constant systemic hemodynamics, ketamine fails to increase ICP in most of the patients. Alpha-2-adrenergic agonists produce no significant changes in ICP, although there may be a transient decrease in ICP with lower doses.", 
    "77": "The goal of therapy in patients with severe head injury is to avoid secondary brain damage. Analgesia and sedation are an essential part of the therapy, and several drugs are in current use. However, few controlled clinical trials have been performed so far, and none of these drugs has proved to be superior. Although in the past the therapy has been focused on controlling elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), many authors emphasize the role of cerebral ischaemia in the prognosis of patients. Therefore, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) i.e. the difference between ICP and mean arterial pressure (CPP = MAP-ICP), seems to be more important than ICP alone. Analgesics and sedatives reduce the cerebral metabolic rate (CMR), and the consequent decrease in cerebral oxygen uptake might prevent ischaemic damage in regions with low perfusion. Moreover, a decrease in CMR is often associated with a decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in regions with normal perfusion and, as a result, ICP is also reduced. Basically, the cerebral effects (on ICP, CMR, and CBF) and the haemodynamic effects with respect to maintenance of a sufficient CPP are most important in the selection of drugs for analgosedation. In addition, the effects on general intensive care management must be considered (pulmonary function, immunreactivity bowel motility). The purpose of this paper is to describe drugs commonly used for analgosedation in severe head injury. Barbiturates bring about the most pronounced decrease of CMR and ICP. In the past these drugs were used routinely in high doses (\"barbiturate coma\"). However, no improvement in outcome was demonstrable, and vitally dangerous side effects, such as infection, pulmonary dysfunction, arterial hypotension, and renal failure often occurred. High-dose barbiturate therapy is therefore only indicated in exceptional cases, such as refractory increase in ICP with preserved CO2 response of cerebral vessels. The effect is dependent on CMR at the start of this therapy. Benzodiazepines are frequently used in patients with head injury. They cause only a moderate decrease of CMR and ICP. In general, side effects are negligible. However, a possible decrease of MAP by reduced central sympathetic drive has to be taken into account. Opioids are also frequently used in patients with head trauma. The observed cerebral effects are inconsistent. Some authors have described increases in ICP, CBF, and CMR, but in most studies no influence on these values, or a decrease, has been observed. In any case, cautious titration of these drugs and cerebral monitoring are therefore desirable. As with benzodiazepines, a decrease in MAP due to central effects is possible. In addition, opioids inhibit bowel motility. Ketamine is generally used because of its favourable circulatory effects, bronchodilatation and absence of inhibition of bowel motility. In patients with increased ICP, however, it is often considered contraindicated, since it can be associated with cerebral vasodilation and ICP increase. Other studies did not confirm an increase of ICP when controlled ventilation and additional sedation were applied. More recent studies have demonstrated the role of neuroexcitatory NMDA-receptors in ischaemic and traumatic brain damage. Since ketamine exerts an antagonistic effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) and studies in animals have demonstrated a protective effect of ketamine against ischaemic and traumatic brain damage, controlled clinical studies in patients with head injury are desirable. Propofol results in a profound decrease of CMR and a significant decrease of ICP, but often also in haemodynamic depression. Few results obtained during long-term administration are available, but it seems to be beneficial. More clinical studies are warranted. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a physiological substance, which has only sporadically been investigated for sedation in patients with head trauma. The few available studies show beneficial res",

    "80": "We assessed the effect of an ascending-dose regimen on the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant and ataxic effects of pentobarbital in four groups of amygdala-kindled rats. Each rat received 20 bidaily (one every 48 h) trials in which an intraperitoneal (IP) pentobarbital or vehicle injection was delivered 1 h before a convulsive amygdala stimulation. On each trial, the rats in the three pentobarbital groups received either a high dose (50 mg/kg), a low dose (10mg/kg), or ascending doses of pentobarbital that began at 10 mg/kg and increased to as high as 26 mg/kg by 1 mg/kg increments as tolerance developed to its anticonvulsant effect; the rats in the vehicle group received saline. The rats in the ascending-dose condition displayed significantly more tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of pentobarbital than did the other rats; in contrast, the high-dose rats displayed more tolerance to the ataxic effect of pentobarbital than did the other rats. These findings extend previous reports of the facilitatory effect of ascending-dose regimens on the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of benzodiazepines, and show that the facilitatory effect of ascending-dose regimens does not extend to all drug effects.", 
    "81": "The mesocortical dopamine system is thought to play an important role in the etiology of the stress response. Dopamine (DA) has been shown to accumulate in the rat frontal cortex in response to a wide variety of stressors. Diazepam, an anxiolytic benzodiazepine, can reverse the effects of stress on cortical DA. We investigated the effects of acute and chronic diazepam administration on immobilization stress-induced changes of the DA system in the frontal cortex of the rat. In the first study, 2.5 mg/kg diazepam was administered 20 min prior to 40 min of immobilization stress. Acute diazepam significantly reduced basal levels of extracellular DA and antagonized the stress-induced increase in cortical DA when compared to untreated stressed rats. Acute diazepam did not significantly effect extracellular DOPAC. In the second study, an experimental group of rats was given approximately 2 mg/kg/day diazepam in their drinking water for 3 weeks. This treatment significantly reduced anxiety as assessed by a staircase test for anxiety. Chronic diazepam had no effect on basal levels of cortical DA. However, chronic diazepam treatment also attenuated stress-induced increases in extracellular DA when compared to untreated stressed control rats. Chronic diazepam did not affect stress-induced changes in DOPAC but it did antagonize the effects of stress on HVA. Thus, acute and chronic diazepam treatment can antagonize stress-induced activation of the mesocortical DA system. It is proposed that this effect is produced through an enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission by diazepam. The role of the dopaminergic system during stress, anxiety, and schizophrenia is discussed.", 
    "82": "Steady-state levels of oxazepam (OX), nordiazepam (ND), and diazepam (DZ) in plasma, brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and intracranial microdialysis perfusate were determined in dogs dependent on 0.56, 4.5, 9, and 36 mg/kg per day of DZ. There was a linear relationship between the total plasma and brain levels of DZ, ND, and OX and the chronic dose of DZ. Levels of free benzodiazepines in plasma and CSF and levels in microdialysis perfusates from plasma and brain were significantly correlated. With increasing dependence on DZ there was progressively more free ND and OX and less free DZ in plasma, CSF, and brain. There was a correlation between several signs of precipitated abstinence and free ND in the brain interstitial fluid, whereas convulsions emerged only when free metabolites exceeded free DZ. The changes in contribution of free DZ, ND, and OX to the overall levels of benzodiazepines present in the CNS may explain differences in signs of abstinence for different levels of dependence on DZ.", 
    "83": "Drugs with different intrinsic activity at 5-HT1A receptors and antagonists at 5-HT2A/2C and 5-HT3 receptors were studied for their ability to increase the rates of punished operant responding in rats. Like chlordiazepoxide (5 and 10 mg/kg) and diazepam (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg), 0.125 mg/kg 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and 5 and 10 mg/kg ipsapirone, a partial agonist at these receptors, increased the rates of punished responding, whereas (S)-WAY 100135, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, had no effect at doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg. 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone, like benzodiazepines, significantly reduced unpunished responding. The 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists ritanserin (2 mg/kg), mianserin (8 mg/kg), and mesulergine (0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased the rates of punished responding, whereas 0.5-2 mg/kg ketanserin, that has higher affinity for 5-HT2A than 5-HT2C receptors, had no effect. Antagonists, at 5-HT3 receptors such as ondansetron (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and tropisetron (0.001-0.1 mg/kg), had no effect on punished or unpunished responding. The results show that agents acting as full or partial agonists at 5-HT1A receptors and blockers of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors have anxiolytic-like effects in a model of punished operant responding, whereas antagonists at 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 receptors have no such effect.", 
    "84": "Invasive endoscopic procedures such as total colonoscopy result in a better patient acceptance, the less discomfort they cause. Therefore a premedication for total colonoscopy is often required. In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of 132 patients examined by one experienced endoscopist we compared two premedication schedules: midazolam (mean 5.2 mg i.v.) versus midazolam (mean 4.8 mg) plus pethidin (50 mg). We found that the combination midazolam plus pethidin provides a deeper and more reliable sedation and analgesia than midazolam alone. The combination of both drugs caused also more anterograde amnesia. It was also shown, that the endoscopist scored a higher degree of patient's pain during the examination than the patient did himself. No more negative side-effects such as decrease of arterial partial pressure of oxygen or cardiopulmonary complications were found using the combination of both drugs; they provided to be safe without added risk of hypoxia. Thus, the combination of both drugs can be given as premedication for total colonoscopy.", 
    "85": "Seventy-seven children for minor surgery of less than 90 minutes in duration were divided into two groups; one group received midazolam syrup and the other received bromazepam suppository. The sedative effect before or after the induction of the anesthetic, the effect on the circulatory system, and the prolongation of the sedative effect after surgery were studied. Regarding the sedative effect before or during the induction of anesthesia, both medications were effective with no significant difference between the two groups. However, the bromazepam suppository had a significantly better sedative effect 1 or 2 hours after the surgery. In children under 4 years of age, the sedative effect during the induction was obtained by administering midazolam syrup before the surgery. It is indicated that midazolam syrup is superior to the bromazepam suppository in children under 4 years of age.", 
    "86": "A novel series of 1-aroylmethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one derivatives was prepared and evaluated for activity as gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor antagonists. In vitro binding studies showed that some derivatives exhibited potent affinity for gastrin CCK-B receptor and high selectivity over peripheral CCK(CCK-A) receptor. Furthermore these compounds potently inhibited pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion upon intravenous administration in an in vivo model in rats. Structure-activity relationship studies of this series suggested that 1-[(R)-2,3-dihydro-1-(2,3-dihydro-1-(2-methylphenacyl)-2-oxo-5-phe nyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]-3-(3-methylphenyl)urea (35b, YM022) was the optimal compound with IC50 values of 0.17, 0.11 and 150 nM for gastrin, CCK-B and CCK-A receptors, respectively, and an ED50 value of 9.5 nmol/kg (i.v.) in rats. The absolute configuration of the precursor of YM022, an (R)-3-amino-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one derivative ((R)-25), was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis of its (S) mandelate. It would be expected that YM022, a potent and selective gastrin CCK-B receptor antagonist, inhibits gastric acid secretion without inducing gastrin-mediated side effects such as hypergastrinemia and hyperplasia of oxyntic mucosa.", 
    "87": "The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a greater incidence of psychotropic drugs in the blood of those 'responsible' for an accident compared with those not 'responsible' for an accident. Blood samples were taken from people involved in accidents presenting at the accident and emergency departments of two teaching hospitals over a five-month period and analysed for the presence of alcohol, tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs) and benzodiazepines (BZs). Details of the accident were used to produce a test group (accidents where a drug may have contributed) and a control group (accidents where the presence of a drug could not have been a factor). In total, 229 samples were collected. The only criterion for inclusion in the study was that the accident was of sufficient severity to merit the routine taking of a blood sample, in which case an additional amount was taken for the purposes of this investigation. In all, 63 samples (27.5%) were positive for at least one of alcohol, TCA or BZ. Of the accidents represented by these samples, 48 could have been caused by the presence of the drug (responsible group) and 15 could not (not responsible group). There was a significantly greater representation of TCAs and BZs in the blood taken from the responsible group compared with the not responsible group (P < 0.0045).", 
    "88": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were measured in 11 patients with panic disorder (PD) prior to and following 7 months of treatment with alprazolam or imipramine and in six neurological control patients. Although a clear treatment response was observed in patients with PD, neither alprazolam nor imipramine significantly changed CSF GABA during the treatment period. A negative correlation was demonstrated between baseline CSF GABA and posttreatment overt psychopathology. Low pretreatment level of CSF GABA correlated significantly with poor therapeutic outcome, judged by the amount of anxiety and depression as well as by the frequency of panic attacks at the end of follow-up.", 
    "89": "The Dutch Behaviour Observation Scale-Geriatrics (GOS-G) is designed to give a detailed description of the functioning of geriatric patients. This article reports the psychometric properties of the GOS-G for use in homes for the elderly. Analysed were data on 71 residents of 11 homes (they participated in a study on withdrawal of benzodiazepines). They were free of serious physical and psychological complaints. For 55 persons from 10 different homes the observation scale was filled out by two different care takers at three different occasions: twice at the start of the study with a time interval of one to three weeks, and once more after eight months. Sixteen residents from another rest home were evaluated with the GOS-G by two different care takers at one occasion. The findings in this selective sample suggest the total scale to be a reliable and valid measure of the daily functioning in homes for the elderly. Moreover, the total scale appears sensitive to change. The scores on the subscales 'psychotic behaviour' and 'disoriented behaviour' were unreliable. Observation of a more heterogeneous and larger sample is needed to confirm the usefulness of the GOS-G in homes for the elderly.", 
    "90": "Simmondsin, a glycoside extracted from jojoba meal (Simmondsia chinensis), causes a reduction in food intake after oral administration. To investigate the mechanism by which simmondsin reduces food intake, fasted and free-feeding rats were given simmondsin-supplemented food and simultaneously injected with devazepide, a specific antagonist of peripheral-type cholecystokinin receptors (CCKA receptors). In free-feeding rats, supplementation of food with 0.5% simmondsin caused a reduction in food intake of +/- 40% in the period of 4 h following food presentation. Intraperitoneal injection of 100 micrograms devazepide/kg body weight prevented this effect. In rats fasted for 20 h, the food intake in the 30 min after presentation of food supplemented with 0.15% or 0.50% simmondsin was reduced in a dose-related manner; this was also inhibited by simultaneous application of devazepide. It is suggested that peripheral CCKA receptors are involved in the effect of simmondsin on food intake. However, a direct effect of simmondsin on CCKA receptors has been excluded, since simmondsin was unable to cause contraction of the guinea-pig gallbladder in vitro.", 
    "91": "CYP3A2 is one of the most abundantly expressed cytochrome P450s (CYPs) in the rat liver and metabolizes numerous clinically important drugs. Studies were designed to examine efficacy, potency and specificity of antisense inhibition of CYP3A2 in vivo. Three phosphorothioate ODNs were used: 3A2-ATG, antisense to the CYP3A2 mRNA translational start site; 3A2-REV, 5' to 3' reverse sequence of 3A2-ATG; and C-MYC, antisense to the C-MYC mRNA translational start site. Midazolam (MZ) sleep times were used as CYP3A2-specific in vivo marker in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Administration of 1 mg/day 3A2-ATG for 2 days i.p. significantly increased MZ sleep times from 22.4 +/- 0.4 (saline) to 35.3 +/- 1.5 min. Administration of equivalent doses of noncomplementary 3A2-REV or C-MYC produced no significant changes in MZ sleep times (22.4 +/- 0.6 and 22.8 +/- 1.3, respectively). Liver microsomal erythromycin demethylase activity, a specific CYP3A2 assay, was significantly decreased from 124 +/- 13 mumol/mg per min in saline controls to 63.8 +/- 8 in 3A2-ATG-treated rats. Enzyme activities for CYPs 2E1, 1A1/2 and 2B1/2 were not significantly different between saline controls and 3A2-ATG-treated animals. The control ODNs 3A2-REV and C-MYC had no significant changes in enzymatic activities compared to saline. Western blot analysis revealed decreases in CYP3A2 protein but not CYP2B1 protein in 3A2-ATG rat microsomes compared to controls. These studies demonstrate for the first time that antisense ODNs can effectively, potently, and specifically inhibit CYP3A2 in vivo.", 
    "92": "In this study we examined the binding characteristics of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor complex after chronic pentobarbital sodium treatment in cultured mammalian cortical neurons. Chronic pentobarbital sodium treatment (200 microM, 5 days) did not alter the basal binding of ligands like [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5 alpha][1,4]-BZ-3-carboxylate and [3H]ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro- 5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5 alpha][1,4]BZ-3-carboxylate that bind to the benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site of the GABAA receptor complex. Similarly, chronic pentobarbital sodium treatment did not alter the basal binding of [3H]GABA and t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate. However, chronic pentobarbital sodium treatment produced uncoupling between GABA, barbiturate and neurosteroid sites with the BZ site. The efficacy (Emax) values of GABA, pentobarbital and neurosteroid, 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one, on [3H]flunitrazepam binding were significantly decreased, whereas their potency (EC50) values were not altered after chronic pentobarbital sodium treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that chronic pentobarbital sodium treatment produces heterologous uncoupling of the GABA-BZ receptor ionophore complex.", 
    "93": "A group of pyrrolopyrimidine derivatives were examined for their interaction with rat recombinant gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors using the whole cell patch clamp and equilibrium binding techniques. In the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype of GABAA receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, a prototype pyrrolopyrimidine, U-89843A (7H-pyrrol[2,3-d]pyrimidine,6,7-methyl-2,4-di- 1-pyrrolidinyl,hydrochloride), dose-dependently enhanced 5 microM GABA-induced Cl- currents with a maximal enhancement of 362 +/- 91%, a half-maximal concentration of 2 +/- 0.4 microM and a slope factor of 1.1 +/- 0.4. The drug also inhibited [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in rat cerebrocortical membranes with a similar half-maximal inhibitory concentration. The enhancement of Cl- currents by U-89843A was insensitive to Ro 15-1788 (a benzodiazepine antagonist), was also observed in the alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtypes (no selectivity to different alpha-isoforms unlike many benzodiazepines), but was absent in the receptor subtypes consisting of two subunits (alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 1 gamma 2 and beta 2 gamma 2). It has been known that neurosteroids and barbiturates are uniformly active in both the two subunit receptors, substituted pyrazinones are only active in the alpha 1 beta 2 subtype and loreclezole is active in the subtypes containing beta 2. We propose that U-89843A interacts with an allosteric site on GABAA receptors distinct from the sites for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids, substituted pyrazinones or loreclezole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "94": "Neuropathic pains have often been classified as opioid-resistant. Here, spinal (intrathecal) actions of morphine and nonmorphine opioids have been studied in a nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain in rats. Mechanical allodynia was evaluated using von Frey filaments. Nerve-injured animals exhibited allodynia that was stable for up to 6 weeks after the surgery. Morphine did not alter allodynia at doses up to 300 nmol (100 micrograms). In contrast, [D-Ala2, NMPhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), a high-efficacy mu opioid agonist, produced a significant, dose-related antiallodynic action. [D-Ala2, Glu4]deltorphin (delta agonist) produced a significant antiallodynic effect only at 300 nmol, reaching approximately 70% of the maximum. Coadministration of morphine with a dose of [D-Ala2, Glu4]deltorphin, which was inactive alone, produced a significant and long-lasting antiallodynic action that was antagonized by NTI (delta receptor antagonist); NTI alone had no effect. Although blockade of cholecystokinin-B (CCKB) receptors with L365,260 did not produce effects alone, a significant antiallodynic action was observed when coadministered with morphine; this elevation of nociceptive threshold was abolished by NTI. The finding that DAMGO, but not very large doses of morphine, produced antiallodynic actions suggests that the ability of mu opioids to alleviate the allodynia is related, in part, to efficacy at postsynaptic mu receptors. At an inactive dose, a delta agonist or a CCKB antagonist enhanced morphine antiallodynic efficacy in an NTI-sensitive fashion. CCKB receptor blockade may enhance endogenous enkephalin actions, resulting in enhancement of morphine efficacy through a mu-delta receptor interaction.", 
    "95": "The ability of fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline and desmethyl sertraline to inhibit the CYP3A subfamily of cytochromes P450 was examined in vitro, using the formation of 1'-hydroxy midazolam as a probe for CYP3A catalytic activity. The inhibition observed with these four compounds was modeled using competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive and mixed competitive/noncompetitive relationships by nonlinear regression analysis. The best fit model of the inhibition of CYP3A-mediated 1'-hydroxy midazolam formation by all four compounds examined was determined to be mixed inhibition. The calculated Ki values were 65.7 +/- 12.0 microM for fluoxetine, 19.1 +/- 1.9 microM for norfluoxetine, 64.4 +/- 11.6 microM for sertraline and 48.1 +/- 11.6 microM for desmethyl sertraline. Steady-state plasma levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine can approach a concentration of 1 microM (approximately 350 ng/ml of plasma). Assuming an inhibitor concentration of 1 microM and a concentration of the substrate substantially below its Km (at least 10-fold lower), the results reported predict that fluoxetine and norfluoxetine together would inhibit CYP3A catalytic activity by less than 7% (less than 0.7% if the unbound plasma concentration of fluoxetine is considered). By using the same assumptions and concentrations for sertraline and desmethyl sertraline, these agents together would be predicted to inhibit the metabolic clearance of a coadministered CYP3A metabolized drug by less than 4%. The observations reported here suggest that fluoxetine and sertraline would have little effect on CYP3A-mediated clearance of coadministered drugs.", 
    "96": "It is known that spontaneous and stimulated GH secretion is reduced in obesity. On the other hand, it has been recently reported that, in obese subjects, plasma GH levels did not change during a hyperglycemic clamp. To further study the sensitivity of somatotrope cells to inhibitory influences in obesity, we studied the effect of somatostatin, pirenzepine, or glucose on the GH response to GHRH or arginine in 32 obese patients and 30 controls. Basal GH levels were lower in obese than in normal subjects (1.0 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/L, P < 0.05), while insulin-like growth factor-I levels were similar in both groups (137.3 +/- 13.2 vs. 138.8 +/- 12.2 micrograms/L). In obese as well as in control subjects pirenzepine abolished the GH response to either GHRH (AUC0-120: 43.7 +/- 9.6 vs. 258.3 +/- 59.9 micrograms/L/h, P < 0.04 and 113.0 +/- 75.0 vs. 870.5 +/- 255 micrograms/L.h, P < 0.01, respectively) or arginine (6.5 +/- 2.5 vs. 118.7 +/- 55.9 micrograms/L.h, P < 0.05 and 47.7 +/- 7.3 vs. 334.0 +/- 157.5 micrograms/L.h, P < 0.01, respectively). Differently from pirenzepine, glucose blunted the GH response to either GHRH or arginine in control subjects (260.8 +/- 38.3 vs. 479.5 +/- 83.9 micrograms/L.h, P < 0.03 and 294.8 +/- 46.3 vs. 625.1 +/- 139.1 micrograms/L.h, P < 0.05, respectively), but failed to modify it in obese patients (193.7 +/- 39.4 vs. 172.4 +/- 33.6 micrograms/L.h and 121.1 +/- 43.4 vs. 155.1 +/- 39.7 micrograms/L.h, respectively). On the other hand, somatostatin deeply blunted the GHRH-induced GH release in obese patients (58.5 +/- 25.4 vs. 548.7 +/- 196.6 micrograms/L.h, P < 0.05) as well as in controls (181.4 +/- 44.4 vs. 759.7 +/- 46.6 micrograms/L.h, P < 0.04). In conclusion, our results show that, in obesity, the stimulated GH release is refractory to the inhibitory effect of glucose but not of pirenzepine, in spite of their likely common mechanism of action, i.e. increase of hypothalamic somatostatin release. Exogenous somatostatin is able to abolish GH secretion both in normal and obese subjects. These data suggest the existence of a peculiar inhability of hyperglycemia to trigger somatostatinergic release in obesity.",

    "109": "During transient cerebral ischemia, there is a temporary and robust accumulation of extracellular GABA in the hippocampus. We examined whether the acute exposure of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors to high concentrations of GABA early after ischemia results in receptor down-regulation as observed in vitro. Gerbils were killed 30 and 60 min following a 5-min bilateral carotid occlusion, and their brains were prepared for receptor autoradiography. The hydrophilic, GABAA receptor antagonist [3H]SR-95531 and the hydrophobic benzodiazepine agonist [3H]flunitrazepam were used to distinguish between cell surface and internalized receptors. Ischemia significantly decreased [3H]SR-95531 binding in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 and in the dentate gyrus 30 min after ischemia. Scatchard analysis in area CA1 revealed that ischemia decreased the Bmax as low as 44%. The affinity of the remaining sites was increased substantially (72% decrease in KD). As expected, there were no changes in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to hippocampus in the early postischemic period because the benzodiazepine could bind to both internalized receptors and those on the cell surface. We hypothesize that prolonged exposure (approximately 30-45 min) of GABAA receptors to high concentrations of synaptic GABA in vivo causes receptor down-regulation, perhaps via receptor internalization.", 
    "110": "The alcohol-sensitive (ANT) rat line, developed for high behavioral sensitivity to ethanol, also exhibits enhanced sensitivity to benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. The rat line carries a point mutation in the cerebellum-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subunit alpha 6, making their diazepam-insensitive (DIS) receptors sensitive to diazepam. We now report that phenotypes of individual ANT and alcohol-insensitive rats, classified on diazepam sensitivity of cerebellar [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding, correlated well with homozygous wild-type, homozygous mutant, and heterozygous genotypes, although some heterozygotes were biased toward the parental phenotypes. GABA down-modulated DIS [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in mutant homozygotes but tended to up-modulate it in heterozygotes and wild-type homozygotes. Slopes for GABA inhibition of cerebellar t-butyl- bicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate binding were larger in mutant than in wild-type homozygotes, with heterozygotes being intermediate. Diazepam displacement of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in heterozygotes revealed three components, with their affinities indistinguishable from those in combined wild-type and mutant homozygotes. This lack of interaction in DIS binding between wild-type and mutant alpha 6 subunits was substantiated by experiments on recombinant receptors. The data suggest that the alpha 6 subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the heterozygotes are formed from individual mutant and wild-type subunits with their relative expression differing from animal to animal.",
