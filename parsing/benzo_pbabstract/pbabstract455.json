    "0": "The role of endogenous opiates and cholecystokinin (CCK) in the control of postprandial pyloric myoelectric activity was investigated in conscious dogs with chronically implanted intraparietal electrodes at the gastroduodenal junction. Meals consisted of either 20 g/kg of canned food (standard meal) or the same food supplemented with 0.5 mL/kg of arachis oil (fat meal). During the 6 hours after standard and fat meals, the number of pyloric spike bursts, 2-4 seconds in duration, was 61.8 +/- 15.8 and 49.9 +/- 12.7/15 minutes, respectively. Administered 15 minutes before a fat meal, naloxone (50 micrograms/kg IV) decreased the number of spike bursts by 31.4%, whereas methyl-levallorphan, a peripheral opiate antagonist, increased postprandial spike activity by 22.2% when administered IV (0.5 mg/kg) and decreased it when administered intracerobroventricularly at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg. These two antagonists administered in the same conditions before a standard meal had no effect on the postprandial spike activity. A 1-hour infusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), 500 ng.kg-1.h-1 IV and 50 ng.kg-1.h-1 intracerebroventricularly, performed 1 hour after a standard meal induced a 19.6% and 15.8% decrease in the number of pyloric spike bursts, respectively. Both naloxone IV (50 micrograms/kg) and methyl-levallorphan intracerebroventricularly (10 micrograms/kg) administered before the infusion of CCK-8 reinforced this pyloric inhibition, which was antagonized by methyl-levallorphan IV (0.5 mg/kg). The CCK antagonist asperlicin, 200 micrograms/kg IV and 20 micrograms/kg intracerebroventricularly, administered before a fat meal increased pyloric spike bursts by 22.0% and 31.5%, respectively. These results indicate that after a fat meal, endogenous opiates exert a peripheral inhibitory and central stimulatory control of pyloric motility; they suggest the involvement of both peripheral and central release of CCK.", 
    "1": "Lorazepam, antipyrine, and indocyanine green were administered to 10 patients with severe head injuries as marker substrates of hepatic glucuronidation, oxidation, and hepatic blood flow, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were determined at baseline (20 to 80 hours after injury) and up to three additional times thereafter (study days 4, 7, and 14). Antipyrine clearance was increased significantly from baseline (0.50 +/- 0.31 ml/min/kg) on study days 4, 7, and 14 (p less than 0.0001). Increases in antipyrine clearance from baseline to the last study day were observed in all study patients ranging from 14% to 207%. A significant increase was also observed in lorazepam clearance on study day 14 relative to baseline (1.39 +/- 0.56 ml/min/kg) (p less than 0.005). Increases in lorazepam clearance occurred in seven of nine patients over time ranging from 9% to 130%. The unbound fraction of lorazepam did not change significantly over the study period. Likewise, no significant change was observed in the clearance of indocyanine green over time. Antipyrine clearance and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (r = 0.41), and lorazepam clearance and C-reactive protein (r = -0.38) were significantly correlated (p less than 0.05). Similarly, antipyrine and lorazepam clearances were significantly correlated with injury severity based on the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (r = -0.43 and r = -0.37, respectively). These findings suggest that hepatic oxidative and conjugative metabolism increase significantly over time in patients after acute head injury. An awareness of the potential for pharmacokinetic alterations in similarly metabolized drugs used for patients with severe head injuries is recommended.", 
    "2": "Methohexital is an ultrashort-acting barbiturate widely used in dentistry because of its rapid onset, predictable effects, and short duration of action. Like other barbiturates, methohexital exerts its effects through the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex. By binding to its own receptor on the complex, methohexital augments the inhibitory effect of GABA on neurons and additionally can exert a similar effect independent of GABA. After intravenous injection, maximal brain concentrations are achieved within 30 sec and then quickly fall as the drug is redistributed to other tissues, yielding a duration of action after a single dose of 4 to 7 min. Hepatic metabolism accounts for elimination of the drug. Methohexital at conventional doses in healthy individuals is a mild respiratory depressant with modest cardiovascular effects. Adverse effects, however, can include apnea, cardiovascular depression, laryngospasm, hiccough, and allergic-like reactions. Although more recently introduced drugs, such as midazolam, etomidate, and propofol, have specific advantages, methohexital remains a drug of choice for dental outpatient anesthesia because of its low cost, rapid onset, short duration, lack of secretory or emetic properties, and proven history.", 
    "3": "The influence of longterm increase in the plasma CCK levels on beta-cell function in rats was studied by using the pancreatico-biliary diversion (PBD) model. An intravenous glucose load (800 mg glucose/kg) was performed three weeks after the PBD operation. Additionally a group of PBD operated animals as well as an unoperated group received the CCK receptor antagonist L364,718 continuously during the three week study period. The proliferation rate of endocrine pancreatic cells was studied by means of 3H-thymidine administration. PBD caused a decrease in basal levels of insulin and glucose and an augmented insulin secretory response after glucose injection. There was no appreciable influence on the glucose elimination rate. When PBD animals were given the CCK receptor antagonist no differences were observed with regard to insulin and glucose compared to PBD animals without antagonist. The CCK-antagonist did not influence the beta-cell function in unoperated animals. Further, the proliferation rate of the endocrine pancreatic cells was not significantly changed in the PBD rats. The results suggest that PBD is accompanied by significant changes in basal and stimulated insulin secretion. These changes are probably not a direct consequence of the increased plasma CCK levels that follows PBD. Moreover, the insulin secretory response to glucose in normal rats was not influenced by longterm administration of the CCK receptor antagonist. Our observations should encourage further studies on the complex entero-insular interactions following pancreaticobiliary diversion.", 
    "4": "26 patients with generalized anxiety disorder have been treated with diazepam (20 mg/24h) for 3 weeks. Blood samples were taken on the days of clinical assessment (before treatment and on the 7th, 14th, 21st day). Determination of drug level was performed parallelly by RRA and GC. The results obtained by both methods agreed well. The intra- and interindividual variations were high. We conclude that diazepam can adequately be measured by both techniques.", 
    "5": "Acylated derivatives of 4-methyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-one (1) and of 2-methyl-4-phenyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepino-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (10) were synthesized and preliminarily tested on their central activity. Acylation was carried out with alpha, beta-unsaturated acid chlorides, dicarboxylic acid monoester monochlorides, and dicarboxylic acid dichlorides. Compounds 2, 3, 11 and 12 had analgesic, compounds 4, 11 and 12--anticonvulsant, and compounds 3 and 11--antiaggressive properties.", 
    "6": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a water soluble 1,4-benzodiazepine, has been studied in 12 patients (11 male, 1 female; age range 19-57 years) with epilepsy. All patients were taking hepatic enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on a regular basis. Midazolam (5 mg) was administered intravenously and 1 week later midazolam was administered intramuscularly, the dose used being dependent on the sedative response to the intravenous dose (10 mg, n = 2; 7 mg, n = 8; 5 mg, n = 2). Serial blood samples were collected at timed intervals for 5-7 h. After intravenous administration initial distribution was rapid with a mean half-life (t 1/2 alpha) of 0.06 +/- 0.03 h followed by a terminal half-life (t 1/2 beta or gamma) of 1.5 +/- 0.3 h. Volume of distribution was 0.62 +/- 0.27 l/kg. After intramuscular administration midazolam was rapidly absorbed with peak serum concentrations achieved at 25 +/- 23 min. Two patients showed delayed absorption. Mean terminal half-life was 2.8 +/- 1.7 h. The absolute bioavailability of intramuscular midazolam was calculated in 11 patients as 87 +/- 18%. Sedation was rapid (less than 1-2 min) but transient (7-75 min) after intravenous and slower (2-30 min) and for a longer period (20-120 min) after intramuscular administration. Since intravenous administration of AEDs including diazepam is not always feasible in status epilepticus there are obvious advantages in having an effective intramuscular formulation. Our data suggest that midazolam may be such a drug.", 
    "7": "The role of vagal afferent pathways and cholecystokinin (CCK) in mediating changes in gastric motor function after a meal was investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats. Proximal gastric motor function was measured manometrically, and nutrients were infused into an isolated segment of duodenum. Inhibition of gastric motility in response to duodenal infusion of protein (peptone or casein), but not carbohydrate (glucose), was significantly attenuated by administration of the CCK antagonist, L364,718. Selective ablation of vagal afferents by perineural treatment with the sensory neurotoxin, capsaicin, significantly reduced responses to both duodenal protein and glucose. These results suggest that protein in the duodenum decreases proximal gastric motor function via release of CCK and a vagal capsaicin-sensitive afferent pathway. In contrast, glucose acts via a capsaicin-sensitive vagal pathway not involving CCK. Thus separate neural and hormonal mechanisms mediate the effects of different nutrients in the duodenal feedback regulation of gastric motor function.", 
    "8": "The selective type A and B cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists L364,718 and L365,260 were used to identify the receptor subtype that mediates the satiety effect of endogenous CCK. Male rats (n = 12-13/group), fed ground rat chow ad lib, received L364,718 (0, 1, 10, 100, or 1000 micrograms/kg IP) or L365,260 (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 10,000 micrograms/kg IP) 2 h after lights off, and food intake was measured 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 h later. L364,718 significantly stimulated 1.5-h food intake by more than 40% at 10 micrograms/kg and higher doses; cumulative intake at 3.5 and 5.5 h remained elevated by about 20% at 1000 and 100 micrograms/kg of L364,718, respectively. In contrast, L365,260 had no significant stimulatory effect on feeding at any dose. The potency of L365,260 for antagonizing gastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was examined in unanesthetized rats. Male rats (n = 14), prepared with gastric and jugular vein cannulas, received doubling doses of gastrin (G-171) (0.16-5 nmol/kg/h IV), each dose for 30 min, and gastric juice was collected for each 30-min period. G-171 stimulated gastric acid output dose dependently; the minimal effective dose was 0.16 nmol/kg/h, while maximal output (5-fold above basal) occurred at 5 nmol/kg/h. L365,260 (0, 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 10,000 micrograms/kg IV), administered 30 min before continuous infusion of G-171 (1.25 or 5 nmol/kg/h), significantly inhibited acid output only at 10,000 micrograms/kg; cumulative 60-min output was decreased by 60%. These results suggest that CCK acts at CCK-A receptors to produce satiety during the dark period in ad lib-feeding rats.", 
    "9": "Endogenous substances which inhibited the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) to bovine synaptosomal membranes have been purified from the hot acetic acid extracts of the bovine brain. Three peaks of inhibitory activity were obtained by Sephadex G-10 gel chromatography. Two of the peaks (Peak 2, and Peak 3) which had lower molecular weights than that of peak 1 were identified as inosine and hypoxanthine by TLC methods. Another peak (Peak 1) was further purified to homogeneity using both cation and anion ion-exchange chromatography and the following two-step reversed-phase HPLC. The purified substance inhibited the [3H]FNZ binding dose-dependently and competitively but did not have an effect on the binding of the peripheral-type BZ ligand [3H]Ro 5-4864. It was also shown that the substance was heat-stable and resistant to proteolytic degradation (trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, pronase). However, a significant loss of inhibitory activity to [3H]FNZ binding was observed after acid hydrolysis. Molecular weight estimates based on gel filtration methods were less than 500 dalton, and the maximal ultraviolet absorption peak was at 314 nm. These results suggest that this substance is a new endogenous ligand for the central BZ receptor and may play an important role in regulating the GABAergic tone in the central nervous system.", 
    "10": "Relationships between alcoholism and anxiety disorder are well known by clinicians. Studies have recently shown that the prevalence of alcohol abuse or dependence is very high in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (Thyer et al., 1986; Bibb and Chambless, 1986). The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and comorbidity of alcohol abuse and dependence in a population of panic outpatients who were consecutive referrals for treatment of panic disorder (PD) in an anxiety clinic. Patients were interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Version Modified for the study of anxiety disorders (SADS-LA) which is a standardized and semi-structured interview allowing to make diagnoses according to RDC, DSM III and DSM III-R criteria. One hundred and three panic patients (39 males and 64 females) were included in the study. Their mean age was 38.5 years (SD: 11.6). In this sample, 24.3% met the DSM III-R criteria for alcohol abuse and 8.7% those for alcohol dependence. Among these patients, 26.2%, abused of benzodiazepines and 16.5% of them of other substances. We found a high comorbidity rate. In fact, 6.8% of the patients met diagnostic criteria for PD alone, 31.0% for one more diagnosis, 29.1% for two more and 33.0% for three or more besides PD. In this study, we found an association between alcohol abuse and the presence of a lifetime diagnosis of major depressive episode and/or other addictive behaviors. Otherwise, alcohol abuse did not occur more often in patients suffering from panic disorder associated with agoraphobia and/or social phobia.", 
    "11": "The rat forced-swimming test (FST) is widely used for screening substances with a potential antidepressant effect. Rat immobility shown in the FST has been interpreted as \"behavioral despair\" and has been suggested as an animal model of human depression. In the following series of experiments, it is shown that pentobarbital and scopolamine administered immediately after the first phase, and diazepam administered 15 minutes before the first phase, behave as false positives in the FST. It is concluded that the learning-memory hypothesis seems to cope better with the behavior of rats during the FST than the \"behavioral despair\" hypothesis. It is also shown that the sensitivity of the FST is affected by the fact that the last saline injection, one hour before the second phase, increases the animals' mobility.", 
    "12": "One-day isolation of male albino mice of SHR strain significantly increased the level of social behaviour measured by the number and total duration of active contacts (sniffings). A putative endogenous anxiogen beta-phenylethylamine (5-12.5 mg/kg) inhibited the communication like human anxiogens corazole (10 mg/kg) and caffeine (200 mg/kg). Diazepam (1 mg/kg) prevented the action of phenylethylamine, phenibut (10-50 mg/kg) exerted no effect on it. The social isolation test during studying anxiogens and anxiolytics can be performed on mice as previously on rats.", 
    "13": "The manufacturers' descriptions for immunoassays for the detection of benzodiazepines in urine suggest that all therapeutically used benzodiazepines are detected equally. It is unlikely that the different molecular structures do not influence the results of pertinent measurements. Therefore, the cross-reactivity of 35 benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-metabolites was determined with the TDx-system. As compared to nordiazepam all compounds--except diazepam--had a reduced cross-reactivity. In order to get a TDx result equal to or exceeding 200 ng/ml nordiazepam-equivalents, high benzodiazepine concentrations in urine are required in some cases. These high concentrations are not obtained in the therapeutic range of application. These considerations can be applied to other immunoassays like RIA and EMIT.", 
    "14": "A population study of drug consumption among people born in 1902 was performed in Ume\u00e5, Sweden. The cohort was followed between 79 and 88 years of age. The number of persons in the study varied between 124 and 72. Mean consumption increased from 2.5 to 5.2 drugs per man and from 3.3 to 5.3 per woman. The main correlate of this increase was shown to be the aging individuals' greater morbidity. Cardiovascular preparations, analgesics, psychoactive substances and drugs used to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common. At the age of 88 years, 45 to 55% of the individuals used drugs belonging to each one of these drug groups. Furthermore, during the 9 years of study there was a substantial increase in use of these drug groups except for the cardiovascular agents, of which the consumption was constant. The proportion of subjects on regular drugs increased from 82% at 79 years to 95% at 88 years of age. Benzodiazepines were, at 88 years, used by almost 40% of the population; at the same age, 43% were using laxatives and 37% diuretics. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was the most common analgesic used. Total consumption of drugs prescribed for hypertension decreased considerably, from 23 to 10%, despite an increase in the use of loop diuretics and vasodilating agents.", 
    "15": "Insomnia is one of the most common complaints encountered by the primary care physician. Yet, in many cases, physicians treat the symptom of insomnia rather than evaluating and treating the underlying causes of insomnia. Because the subjective complaint of insomnia does not always correlate with evidence of objective sleep disruption, a careful history and evaluation are required. Assessment of the duration of insomnia and quantification of the impact of nocturnal sleep disruption on daytime functioning provide the most reliable indices of severity. Primary insomnia may be due to a number of different causes, such as poor sleep hygiene or circadian rhythm disruption. Insomnia may also be the presenting symptom of other primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea syndrome or nocturnal myoclonus, or of a variety of medical or psychiatric illnesses. The treatment of the patient with insomnia should address the underlying cause, when identifiable. When the cause cannot be identified, treatment should be conservative; nonpharmacologic therapies should be used whenever possible. When pharmacologic approaches are indicated, short-acting benzodiazepines should be administered in concordance with strict prescribing guidelines. Frequent follow-up is necessary to ensure continued therapeutic efficacy of the prescribed therapy.", 
    "16": "We have studied the clinical usefulness of Flumazenil to reverse the sedative action of Midazolam in 12 children admitted in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Two groups were established, one treated with individual dose and the other treated with continuous infusion. In four cases the indication of Flumazenil was the reversion of secondary effects and in 8 cases it was elective. The average reversion time was 1.22 +/- 0.42 minutes. Flumazenil is able to reverse immediately the effects of Midazolam.", 
    "17": "The profiles of hepatic drug metabolism were obtained by using young and old male and female rats. The profile obtained from old male rats was completely different from that from young male rats, while it was almost identical to those of females of any ages. This was due to the selective decrease in male hepatic enzyme activities showing higher activities than females to the activity levels of females which did not alter much with aging. Castration of young adult male rats caused a decrease in enzyme activities but did not result in the feminization of the metabolic profile. Administration of testosterone to old male rats resulted in the recovery of the profile of young male rats, but the levels of activities were not as high as young male rats. Plasma testosterone levels were found to decrease in parallel with drug metabolizing activities of male rats during aging. These results suggest that sex hormones play important roles in the alteration of drug metabolizing activities in male rats with aging. The loss of male characteristics in profile of drug metabolism during aging was evaluated by use of antibody to the male specific cytochrome P-450, P-450 m1. Anti-P-450 ml strongly inhibited imipramine N-demethylase activity, which showed marked sex (male greater than female) and age (young greater than old) differences, while this did not inhibit imipramine 2-hydroxylase activity, which showed no sex or age differences. The portion of N-demethylase activity inhibited by this antibody decreased in old rats while the portion not inhibited did not decrease with age. These results indicate that the decrease of sex specific cytochrome P-450 is responsible for the age-associated decrease in at least one of the drug metabolizing enzyme activities in male rats. It is suggested that some processes of the control mechanism of the gene expression of male specific cytochrome P-450 may be altered with old age.", 
    "18": "High working temperatures were used during the separation of benzodiazepines by capillary gas chromatography with Fourier transform infrared detection (FTIR). Spectral identification of these drugs give very good results with 10 micrograms of drug injected. On the contrary, the precision of the quantitative determination is poor.", 
    "19": "Using standardized interviews 374 subjects randomly selected among people living in two villages in a mining district in Sardinia (Italy), were studied. Of these, 57 subjects (15.2%) were identified as 'cases'. Ten per cent of the sample was affected by a depressive syndrome and 4% by an anxiety disorder. Females were significantly more at risk for anxiety disorders, while a trend towards a major risk for depression emerged among middle-aged and elderly people. Of the sample 9.8% were taking benzodiazepines, with a significant over representation of females. Depressed subjects took benzodiazepines more frequently than anxious subjects, while the use of antidepressants was negligible.", 
    "20": "A new analytical methodology was developed for simultaneous high-performance liquid chromatographic quantitation of nitrazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, and triazolam in plasma. After addition of the internal standard nor-prazepam, biological samples and calibration standards were extracted at basic pH into diethyl ether-methylene chloride (2:1, v/v). The reconstituted extract was separated on a reversed-phase Nova Pak C18 column with acidic buffer (6mM)-acetonitrile-methanol (64:23:13, v/v) as mobile phase. The detection was performed at 242 nm. Within-run and day-to-day precision values were about 2-8%. The method is thus sensitive and reproducible for use in clinical and experimental toxicokinetic studies.", 
    "21": "The degree of sedation and amnesia, subjective assessment of awakening and side effects after intravenous injection of 3-4 mg midazolam and 1 mg flumazenil or placebo were studied directly after colonoscopy, and on the first and the eight day. A total of 91 patients were studied; 45 patients were given flumazenil and 46 patients a placebo. Five minutes after injection of the test drugs all 45 patients given flumazenil but only 38 patients given the placebo were alert (p = 0.006). All three response criteria (for sedation, amnesia and subjective assessment of awakening) were fulfilled by 84.4% of the patients given flumazenil and 45.7% of the patients given the placebo (p = 0.0002). Thirty minutes after injection of the test drugs dizziness, nausea, and fatigue were found in 3 patients given flumazenil and in 10 patients given placebo. One day after colonoscopy 9 of 45 patients (20%) given midazolam and flumazenil complained of fatigue and 9 of 46 patients (19.5%) given midazolam and placebo. Eight days (+/- 1 day) later two patients in each group complained of headache, nausea and fatigue. No patient developed phlebitis at the injection site. Flumazenil seems to be a safe and efficient drug for reversing the sedative effect of midazolam, premedication after colonoscopy. However, resedation due to the effects of midazolam may occur. Flumazenil thus permits administration of a higher dose of midazolam without prolongation of the surveillance time. Improved exploitation of time, space and nursing resources is thus possible without jeopardizing patient safety, although caution is necessary since patients may not be fit to resume all normal activities.", 
    "22": "The clinical utility of transcutaneous oxygen saturation monitoring during routine diagnostic and therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy was assessed in 271 consecutive patients. The mean patient age was 56 years (range 14-86 years). The mean preprocedure oxygen saturation was 94% (range 81-100%). The mean dosages of intravenous meperidine, diazepam and midazolam if administered were 50 mg, 6.4 mg and 3.3 mg, respectively. The largest mean decrease in oxygen saturation of all procedures compared to the preprocedure measurement was 3.2% (p = .0001) and occurred immediately after administration of intravenous medication and endoscope intubation. Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy patients experienced similar decreases in oxygen saturation. The patient's age and sex, type of procedure and physician performing the procedure did not affect the degree of desaturation. The largest mean decrease in oxygen saturation observed was less than that considered normal during sleep. The clinical value of transcutaneous oxygen saturation monitoring in routine diagnostic and therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy is not supported by the findings of this study.", 
    "23": "Nine elderly parkinsonian volunteers took single doses of 384 mg of chlormethiazole, 10 mg of temazepam and placebo capsules in a double-blind three-way cross-over study on separate visits at least one week apart. In the 6 hours following the dose, the level of drowsiness, performance on a series of psychomotor tests, effects on parkinsonian symptoms and signs, and standing and lying blood pressure were recorded. Chlormethiazole produced drowsiness on all tests and impaired psychomotor performance, as compared with placebo, without affecting parkinsonian symptoms and signs, or postural blood pressure. Temazepam was consistently less potent than chlormethiazole on tests of drowsiness and psychomotor performance. Both treatments were well tolerated. It is suggested that chlormethiazole is safe to use as a hypnotic at this dosage in this group of patients with Parkinson's disease, while temazepam did not appear to be effective as a hypnotic at this dosage.", 
    "24": "The present study shows that [3H]4-DAMP binds specifically, saturably, and with high affinity to muscarinic receptor sites in the rat brain. In homogenates of hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, and thalamus, [3H]4-DAMP appears to bind two sub-populations of muscarinic sites: one class of high-affinity, low capacity sites (Kd less than 1 nM; Bmax = 45-152 fmol/mg protein) and a second class of lower-affinity, high capacity sites (Kd greater than 50 nM; Bmax = 263-929 fmol/mg protein). In cerebellar homogenates, the Bmax of [3H]4-DAMP binding sites was 20 +/- 2 and 141 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein for the high- and the lower-affinity site, respectively. The ligand selectivity profile for [3H]4-DAMP binding to its sites was similar for both the high- and lower-affinity sites; atropine = (-)QNB = 4-DAMP much greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116, although pirenzepine was more potent (16-fold) at the lower- than at the high-affinity sites. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]4-DAMP sites revealed a discrete pattern of labeling in the rat brain, with the highest densities of [3H]4-DAMP sites present in the CA1 sub-field of Ammon's horn of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, the olfactory tubercle, the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb and layers I-II of the frontoparietal cortex. Although the distribution of [3H]pirenzepine sites was similar to that of [3H]4-DAMP sites in many brain regions, significant distinctions were apparent. Thus, both the ligand selectivity pattern of [3H]4-DAMP binding and the autoradiographic distribution of sites suggest that although the high-affinity [3H]4-DAMP sites may consist primarily of muscarinic-M3 receptors, the lower-affinity [3H]4-DAMP sites may be composed of a large proportion of muscarinic-M1 receptors.", 
    "25": "Calcium channel antagonists are a diverse class of drugs widely used in combination with other therapeutic agents. The potential exists for many clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between these and other concurrently administered drugs. The mechanisms of calcium channel antagonist-induced changes in drug metabolism include altered hepatic blood flow and impaired hepatic enzyme metabolising activity. Increases in serum concentrations and/or reductions in clearance have been reported for several drugs used with a number of calcium channel antagonists. A number of reports and studies of calcium channel antagonist interactions have yielded contradictory results and the clinical significance of pharmacokinetic changes seen with these agents is ill-defined. The first part of this article deals with interactions between calcium antagonists and marker compounds, theophylline, midazolam, lithium, doxorubicin, oral hypoglycaemics and cardiac drugs.", 
    "26": "In a prospective study, 10 patients (ASA II-IV) with different ailments received varying amounts of an alfentanil/midazolam mixture (consisting of 15 mg of alfentanil and 37.5 mg of midazolam) for analgesia and sedation in a typical ICU setting over a period of 3-14 days. Special interest focussed on potential residual activity of both drugs after termination of the treatment. Since both compounds interact with receptor sites in the CNS, neurophysiological measurements were performed before, during and after the sedation. Thus, EEG power spectra were used to evaluate the central effects of midazolam, while the late peak (greater than 50 ms) of the somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) was used to determine the inhibitory effect of alfentanil on the propagation of efferent nerve volleys along the sensory tract. A residual activity of midazolam after long-term administration seems likely as the return in the fast beta-domain was slow, and the high power in the slow EEG frequency bands delta and theta still persisted 24 hours after treatment. However, rapid recovery of the amplitude of the late N100-peak in the evoked potential suggests no potential \"overhang\" of alfentanil even if administered for several days together with a benzodiazepine. Among the variables most suitable for the determination of a sufficient sedation, the spectral edge activity (the highest frequency component in the EEG incorporating 95% of the entire power spectrum) showed a close relationship to the applied dose. All patients except one, a former alcoholic with CT-verified widening of the cerebral ventricles, could be sufficiently sedated with alfentanil/midazolam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Subarachnoid administration via a catheter of a water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, was tested in the control of cancer pain. First, the lack of its toxicity during constant subarachnoid administration (50 micrograms per day) was assessed in the rat. After 15 days of treatment, a histologic examination of the spinal cord revealed the same amount of fibrosis, infiltration, and deformation in the control group (n = 14), which had received only saline, as in the test group (n = 18), treated with subarachnoid midazolam. Therefore, the histologic changes observed in the spinal cord probably are related to the presence of the catheter. After these results, a mixture of 2 mg midazolam and a variable dose of subarachnoid morphine was injected in two patients presenting chronic neoplastic pain resistant to high doses of morphine. In these two cases, the addition of midazolam appeared to be effective in controlling intractable neoplastic pain.", 
    "28": "Anxiety disorders are common, debilitating illnesses. Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder with a characteristic clinical presentation. A growing body of neuroanatomical and neurochemical data is beginning to elucidate its pathophysiology. There are currently three types of effective pharmacotherapies for panic disorder: tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and highpotency benzodiazepines. The choice of a pharmacologic approach may be guided by considerations of potential side effects and other clinical/pharmacologic concerns.", 
    "29": "The results obtained in a retrospective study on clinical and pharmacological aspects of 41 patients suffering craniocervical dystonia (24 with blepharospasm, 17 with torticollis) and 11 with spasm are here presented. Mean age of symptoms onset was 57.4, 43.8 and 55.8 years old respectively; this variable was comparatively higher in females than in males with torticollis. The prevalence of blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm was higher in females. A 38.7% of patients suffering blepharospasm also presented oromandibular dystonia (Meige's syndrome). Other abnormal movements less frequently associated were cephalic tremor, postural hand tremor and larynx dystonia. In three cases with blepharospasm there was family history of Parkinson's disease and in two cases with torticollis there was family history of essential tremor. The mean age of onset was lower in patients with clonic torticollis and the evolution time of symptoms was longer than in those who presented the tonic type. Clonic torticollis were less frequently associated to pain. Trihexyphenidyl (anticholinergic) was the most efficient drug in craniocervical dystonia, and clonazepam in facial hemispasm. In general, as earliest the age of onset was, as better the therapeutical response was.", 
    "30": "We studied cross-seasonal changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms in 52 wildland firefighters in Northern California. The mean cross-seasonal change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was -1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.5%, -2.0%) with a corresponding mean change in forced expiratory volume (FVC) of -0.3% (95% CI 0.4%, -1.0%). Decreases in FEV1 and FVC were most strongly associated with hours of recent fire-fighting activity (P = .002 and .01, respectively). When the study group was divided into three categories based on recent fire-fighting activity, firefighters in the high activity category (mean +/- SE, 73 +/- 7 hours of fire-fighting in previous week) had a -2.9% (130 mL) change in FEV1 and a -1.9% (102 mL) change in forced vital capacity (FVC). There was a significant cross-seasonal increase in most respiratory symptoms evaluated. Several symptoms (eye irritation, nose irritation, and wheezing) were associated with recent fire-fighting. These findings suggest that wildland firefighters experience a small cross-seasonal decline in pulmonary function and an increase in several respiratory symptoms. Research is under way to identify the fire conditions and specific components of exposure that produce pulmonary irritants, and to examine the potential reversibility of acute pulmonary change.", 
    "31": "Sequential radionuclide imaging and continuous recording of arterial and right heart pressures were carried out during anaesthesia with midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1, pancuronium 0.15 mg kg-1 and fentanyl 10 micrograms kg-1 in eight patients with normal cardiopulmonary status scheduled for craniotomy. The aim was to examine how a stress-free anaesthetic induction tailored to protect against the hypertension and tachycardia provoked by laryngoscopy and intubation influenced left-ventricular performance, left-ventricular loading conditions and plasma catecholamine concentrations. During the 20-min study period no significant changes were observed in heart rate, left-ventricular ejection fraction, ratio of peak systolic pressure to left-ventricular end-systolic volume, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, left-ventricular end-systolic volume, cardiac output, dopamine and noradrenaline concentrations. Except for a minor increase in mean arterial pressure after laryngoscopy and intubation, mean arterial pressure decreased 24%, left-ventricular end-diastolic volume decreased 15%, and left-ventricular stroke volume decreased 21%. Central venous pressure increased by 75% but there was no parallel increase in pulmonary wedge pressure, which in turn did not reflect the alterations in ventricular end-diastolic volume. Plasma adrenaline concentrations decreased significantly (66%). The chosen induction regimen preserved global left-ventricular pump function during laryngoscopy and intubation without any activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Central venous and pulmonary wedge pressures were unreliable in the assessment of ventricular preload during induction of general anaesthesia.", 
    "32": "Spinal block causes paralysis of preganglionic sympathetic fibres, while ketamine induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Hypotension is a frequent complication during spinal anaesthesia and is associated with an increased risk of postoperative mortality. The aim of our study was to compare circulatory changes in patients who received either fentanyl or ketamine during spinal anaesthesia. Thirty patients (ASA I-III) scheduled to undergo spinal anaesthesia for osteosynthesis of hip fractures were allocated to receive either ketamine or fentanyl intravenously during the procedure. Immediately before anaesthesia, 7 ml/kg BW of an isotonic NaCl solution was administered i.v. Patients received either fentanyl 1.5 mg/kg BW i.v. before anaesthesia, or ketamine 0.7 mg/kg BW i.v. before anaesthesia, and 0.35 mg/kg BW 15 and 30 min after the first dose. No prophylactic vasopressor was used. During the first 40 min of anaesthesia a fluid load of 14 ml/kg BW was given i.v. If the mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell more than 20%, the infusion rate was increased. If the reduction in MAP exceeded 33% or if the systolic pressure decreased to less than 80 mmHg, patients were registered as haemodynamically unstable. In both groups the spinal anaesthesia caused a reduction in MAP. The MAP was lower in the fentanyl group than in the ketamine group at all times. In the fentanyl group six subjects developed a haemodynamically unstable condition, while only one subject in the ketamine group was registered as such (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in heart rate in either group. We conclude that during spinal anaesthesia patients can in part be kept haemodynamically stable by intravenous administration of ketamine.", 
    "33": "One of the major problems with total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is postoperative sedation, possibly with respiratory depression. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the recovery characteristics after TIVA using a continuous infusion of a mixture of midazolam and alfentanil with flumazenil reversal before extubation. This method was compared to balanced anaesthesia using midazolam, alfentanil and nitrous oxide without flumazenil reversal. The degree of sedation was measured by reaction time test, Glasgow Coma Scale, cipher copying test and subtraction test. We found significantly faster reaction times postoperatively in the TIVA group (n = 15) compared to the balanced group (n = 13), despite larger doses of both midazolam (median 21 mg versus 9 mg) and alfentanil (median 5.9 mg versus 4.5 mg). The other tests revealed no difference between the groups. One patient became resedated after flumazenil. We conclude that the TIVA technique described here resulted in slightly better recovery characteristics, offering a usable alternative to balanced anaesthesia.", 
    "34": "The vascular response to the muscarinic receptor agonist acetylcholine (ACh) in the presence of selected antagonists was examined in the isolated blood-perfused canine left lower lung lobe under conditions of normal (resting) and elevated vascular tone. At normal vascular tone, ACh (1-5 mumol) produced a dose-dependent increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and downstream resistance (Rds) without altering upstream resistance (Rus). Pirenzepine (50 and 100 nM), the prototype M1-selective antagonist, and gallamine, an M2-selective antagonist, as well as atropine (50 nM) and secoverine (100 nM), nonselective antagonists, attenuated (P less than 0.05) the ACh-induced increase in Ppa and Rds. With elevated vascular tone induced by serotonin infusion, ACh produced a dose-dependent increase in Ppa in 19 of 25 lobes, although Rus decreased while Rds increased in all lobes. At high vascular tone, pirenzepine or gallamine attenuated the ACh-induced increase in Rds, whereas Rus was not affected. Secoverine and atropine antagonized ACh-induced increases in both Rds and Rus. The pA2 values (i.e., the negative log antagonist concentration requiring a doubling of ACh dose for an equivalent increase in Rds) for gallamine, pirenzepine, secoverine, and atropine were 6.1 +/- 0.1, 7.4 +/- 0.1, 8.3 +/- 0.2, and 10.2 +/- 0.3, respectively. These results suggest that 1) ACh increases PVR in the dog by constricting the venous segments (downstream) of the pulmonary circulation via activation of pulmonary vascular muscarinic receptors under conditions of both normal and elevated vascular tone, 2) both M1- and non-M1-muscarinic receptor subtypes appear to participate in mediating the ACh-induced increase in Rds, and 3) ACh moderately relaxes the upstream (arterial) vessels, especially under conditions of elevated tone.", 
    "35": "Pulse oximetry is widely used during anaesthetic practice to monitor heart rate and oxygenation and has been recommended as a monitor when sedative techniques are used. We monitored 25 patients receiving sedation for chemonucleolysis and showed that 17 became hypoxaemic at some stage of the procedure, none of whom had clinically detectable signs of respiratory depression. We recommend that monitoring with pulse oximetry is used in all patients receiving sedation for radiological procedures and that all radiologists administering sedation be trained in airway management.", 
    "36": "The effect of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, was evaluated in a spatial-reference memory procedure in a water maze. Flumazenil (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, ip) did not modify acquisition of spatial information. Retention was similar between control and experimental rats 24 h after the training phase, as all groups showed bias to the target quadrant in a free swim trial. However, 10 days later, only flumazenil-injected rats (3.0 mg/kg) showed bias to the target quadrant. Flumazenil did not affect retrieval of spatial information in a group of well-trained rats. These results suggest that a benzodiazepine-receptor mediated endogenous mechanism is activated during learning of spatial tasks and that its blockade facilitates retention of spatial information.", 
    "37": "The specific antagonist flumazenil has been shown to reverse the central actions of benzodiazepines. Its use, in day-case procedures performed under benzodiazepine sedation, offers the potential for enhanced patient recovery. However, concern has been expressed over the possibility of resedation given the short elimination half-life of flumazenil. A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial was therefore designed to assess patient recovery profiles after flumazenil. A total of 44 adults were entered into the trial. Recovery was assessed by means of a battery of psychomotor tests performed pre- and postoperatively. Psychomotor function in patients receiving flumazenil returned to, or near to, baseline levels within 15 min of administration--an improvement maintained throughout the 6 h test period. Patients receiving placebo did not recover fully until the 2 h test point--significant differences between the two groups existing at 15 min and 1 h. In this study, flumazenil effectively reversed midazolam-induced sedation without evidence of resedation. The implications for day-case surgery are discussed.", 
    "38": "The possible generalization to diazepam of the dampened response to ethanol in sons of alcoholic fathers was evaluated in 62 sons of alcoholics (family history positive [FHP] subjects) and 62 family history negative (FHN) controls (124 men). Following challenges with placebo, .12 and .2 mg/kg of diazepam in three separate sessions, evaluation of subjective feelings and increases in body sway revealed no decreased reaction for FHPs.", 
    "39": "In about 22% of children aged from 7 1/2 to 12 years we established heavy reaction of anxiety.

    "40": "Twenty-six socially phobic outpatients were treated with clonazepam for the relief of symptoms. At evaluation, which took place after an average of 11.3 months of continuous treatment, 22 (84.6%) patients showed good improvement and 4 (14.4%) showed no improvement or were not recovered. The dose declined over time, from a peak mean of 2.1 mg/day to a mean of 0.94 mg/day at follow-up. Side effects are described, along with individual case descriptions that illustrate important aspects of the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of social phobia.",

Reasons for this are described, as are clinical issues of importance to social phobia, including the extensive associated distress and disability.

    "42": "The new triazolobenzodiazepine, adinazolam, which has dual anxiolytic and antidepressant activities, was studied for its effects on hippocampal CA1 norepinephrine and serotonin release in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats, with in vivo voltammetry. Norepinephrine signals were further characterized in vivo by the detection of a significantly increased norepinephrine signal (mean = 25.8%) (p less than 0.003) after intraperitoneal administration of the alpha 2 adrenoreceptor antagonist, yohimbine, and by the detection of a significantly decreased norepinephrine signal (mean = 20.1%) (p less than 0.037) after intraperitoneal administration of the alpha 2 adrenoreceptor agonist, clonidine. Time course studies showed that the anxiolytic-antidepressant drug adinazolam (10 mg/kg IP) significantly decreased hippocampal norepinephrine release (mean = 26.2%) (p less than 0.007). The norepinephrine signal was further significantly decreased by adinazolam (mean = 16.4%) (p less than 0.009) after an additional 2 mg/kg IP injection. Serotonin release, which was detected with norepinephrine in sequence, was also significantly decreased by adinazolam (10 mg/kg IP) (mean = 22.4%) (p less than 0.002). The supplemental dose of adinazolam (2 mg/kg IP), however, did not significantly alter serotonin release any further (p less than 0.307). The findings show that the mechanism of action of adinazolam occurs simultaneously on presynaptic release mechanisms for norepinephrine and for serotonin in CA1 region of hippocampus. These findings implicate that noradrenergic and serotonergic release mechanisms may be responsible in part for the dual anxiolytic-antidepressant efficacy of adinazolam.", 
    "43": "We have analyzed several sedation techniques for paediatric cardiac catheterization which offer stable conditions for a few hours investigation, and maintain spontaneous breathing. In the present study, after premedication with oral flunitrazepam 0.1 mg.kg-1, 14 children aged 1-17 mo were sedated with an individually titrated alfentanil infusion. Every patient was sedated to a level which produced no reaction to pain or any discomfort. The induction dose and the maintenance requirement of alfentanil were 24 +/- 8 micrograms.kg-1 and 32 +/- 8 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (mean +/- SD), respectively. These doses were less in cyanotic than in acyanotic patients: 21 +/- 6 vs 28 +/- 8 micrograms.kg-1 and 29 +/- 10 vs 34 +/- 3 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1, respectively (P less than 0.05). The mean plasma concentration of alfentanil during maintenance of sedation was 79 +/- 23 ng.ml-1. Ventilation of two children was assisted for a short time after an incremental bolus of alfentanil. It is concluded that an alfentanil infusion technique with close monitoring of breathing is a practical sedation method for paediatric cardiac catheterization.", 
    "44": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate epinephrine-aminophylline-induced arrhythmias during halothane anaesthesia after induction with thiopentone or midazolam. Ten mongrel dogs were studied during 1 MAC halothane and 50% N2O:O2 anaesthesia while maintaining constant acid-base status. The minimal arrhythmogenic infusion rate of epinephrine (MAIRE) and the corresponding plasma concentration of epinephrine (MAPC) required to produce ventricular arrhythmias before and after aminophylline were higher following induction of anaesthesia with midazolam than with thiopentone (P less than 0.05); the MAIREs decreased stepwise with aminophylline (P less than 0.05). The correlation coefficient between individual MAIREs and MAPCs was 0.93 (P less than 0.001). Epinephrine alone and in combination with aminophylline was less arrhythmogenic after induction with midazolam than with thiopentone.", 
    "45": "Patients who arrive home several hours after outpatient surgery may drink alcohol. The extent to which residual drugs used in outpatient surgery interact with alcohol is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine if two i.v. drugs commonly used together in outpatient surgery, midazolam and fentanyl, have residual effects which would interact with alcohol drunk 4 h after injection. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled and cross-over study. Subjects were studied four times successively with a period of 1 week between trials. On each day of testing, the subjects received randomly, by slow i.v. injection (30 s), either saline followed immediately by saline, or midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 followed immediately by fentanyl 2 micrograms kg-1. Four hours after the injection, the subjects consumed a beverage which either did or did not contain alcohol 0.7 g kg-1. Before and 1, 3, 5 and 7 h after injection (and before and 1 and 3 h after consumption of beverage), psychomotor performance and mood were assessed. While both the combination midazolam-fentanyl and alcohol had independent effects on the dependent measures in this study, there was no interaction between midazolam-fentanyl and alcohol (no potentiating of effects of alcohol by i.v. sedation). We conclude that the effects of benzodiazepines and opioids that are short-acting and used in outpatient surgery have probably dissipated by the time a patient arrives home, and that effects from alcohol ingested at home will probably not be affected by recent administration of these drugs.", 
    "46": "We have studied interactions between i.v. propofol and midazolam for induction of anaesthesia in 200 unpremedicated female patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgery. Using end-points of \"hypnosis\" (loss of response to verbal command) and \"anaesthesia\" (loss of response to a 5-s transcutaneous tetanic stimulus), we determined dose-response curves for propofol and midazolam alone and in combination. For hypnosis, synergistic interaction was found (P less than 0.01), the combination having 1.44 times the potency of the individual agents. Although midazolam failed to produce anaesthesia in the dose range used, the dose of propofol required to produce anaesthesia was reduced by 52% in the presence of midazolam (P less than 0.01). The reduction in arterial pressure at induction was the same for the combination as for the individual agents. The cause of the synergism was not clear, but may have been interaction at CNS GABAA receptors.", 
    "47": "The hypothesis that benzodiazepine night sedation causes acute tolerance to benzodiazepine sedation given the following morning was examined in six volunteers in a double blind, randomised, crossover study. Before each of three study days, subjects received midazolam 15 mg or flunitrazepam 2 mg or placebo as oral night sedation. They were then given intravenous midazolam 5 mg the following morning and the resulting sedative effects examined, using an observers sedation scale and a psychomotor test battery (critical flicker fusion frequency, digit-symbol substitution, reflex time, tapping test and a visual analogue sedation scale). Although a consistent pattern emerged with the greatest degree of sedation following the placebo night sedation and the least degree of sedation following the midazolam, with flunitrazepam intermediate, no statistically significant differences were present between the three treatment groups. The results indicate that single use of benzodiazepine night sedation is not an important influence on benzodiazepine requirements for intravenous sedation.", 
    "48": "The present report describes a benign disorder of neonates or young infants presenting with generalized hypertonicity accompanied by brisk muscle stretch reflexes, intermittent clonus, and exaggerated startle response. This condition is termed hyperexplexia, and may be either familial or sporadic. Two affected families are reported: Two sisters and their mother are involved in the first family; in the second family, where the parents are asymptomatic first degree cousins, all three siblings suffer from hyperexplexia of various severity. Nose tapping in infants of affected families induced a uniform reaction of facial twitching accompanied by head extension, and a generalized flexor spasm, all of which may be a hallmark of hyperexplexia. Severely hypertonic infants were treated with small doses of benzodiazepines and improved markedly, all becoming asymptomatic by two years of age. Unnecessary investigation and treatment may be avoided by sufficient awareness of possible hyperexplexia.", 
    "49": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), an important therapeutic target in the treatment of AIDS, is effectively inhibited by a class of nonnucleoside analog compounds that includes nevirapine (BI-RG-587) and tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk]-[1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione. We show that both tyrosine residues at positions 181 and 188 flanking the putative catalytic site of HIV-1 RT are required for sensitivity of the enzyme to these compounds. HIV-2 RT, which does not have tyrosines at these positions, is resistant to these nonnucleoside analog inhibitors. Substitution of the HIV-2 RT amino acid residues at position 181 or 188 into HIV-1 RT results in an enzyme that is resistant to these compounds while retaining sensitivity to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate. HIV-2 RT substituted with amino acids 176-190 from HIV-1 RT acquires sensitivity to these nonnucleoside analog inhibitors.", 
    "50": "The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]in) in single cat and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells was measured to determine whether or not there was any correlation between the [Ca2+]in and the catecholamine (CA) secretion caused by muscarinic receptor stimulation. In cat chromaffin cells, methacholine (MCh), a muscarinic agonist, raised [Ca2+]in by activating both Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization with an accompanying CA secretion. In bovine cells, MCh elevated [Ca2+]in by mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ but did not cause CA secretion. The MCh-induced rise in [Ca2+]in in cat cells was much higher than that in bovine cells, but when Ca2+ influx was blocked, the rise was reduced, with a concomitant loss of secretion, to a level comparable to that in bovine cells. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization due to muscarinic stimulation substantially increased secretion from depolarized bovine and cat cells, where a [Ca2+]in elevated above basal values was maintained by a continuous Ca2+ influx. These results show that Ca2+ released from internal stores is not effective in triggering secretion unless Ca2+ continues to enter across the plasma membrane, a conclusion suggesting that secretion depends on [Ca2+]in in a particular region of the cell.", 
    "51": "The stereochemistry of the trans and cis isomers of 2(S)- and 2(R)-oxazolam is described. A total of four molecular structures of the 11b(R) and 11b(S) diastereomers of 2(S)- and 2(R)-oxazolam have been revealed by X-ray diffraction techniques. 2(S)-Oxazolam crystallizes in space group P2(1)/c, with cell dimensions a = 16.180(2) A, b = 8.791(2) A, c = 13.574(2) A, and beta = 102.07(1) degrees. The molecule in an asymmetric unit exhibited disorder at the 2-carbon (C2) atom, and the structures for trans and cis isomers have been resolved crystallographically. 2(S)-Oxazolam forms polymeric chains with intermediation of ethanol through hydrogen bonding. 2(R)-Oxazolam crystallizes in space group P1, with cell dimensions a = 7.754(1) A, b = 8.654(1) A, c = 15.795(2) A, alpha = 104.09(1) degrees, beta = 91.19(1) degrees, and gamma = 114.00(1) degrees. A similar disorder at the C2 position has been elucidated by a mixture of trans- and cis-2(R)-oxazolams. The two 2(R)-oxazolam molecules form a dimer with a hydrogen bond net. The structural details, focusing on the conformation and molecular complex formation of both oxazolams, have been discussed in connection with the oxazolidine ring stability and the crystal polymorph.", 
    "52": "To clarify the action of lormetazepam, 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine, on the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor subtypes, effects of lormetazepam on motor performance in the traction test and hexobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex in mice and the binding to BZ receptor subtypes were investigated in comparison with those of other BZ hypnotics. Lormetazepam prolonged the duration of hexobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex. The minimal effective dose (1 mg/kg, p.o.) was higher than that of flunitrazepam, lower than those of diazepam and zopiclone, and the same as those of triazolam and brotizolam. Lormetazepam showed the ataxic effect at 10 mg/kg, p.o., but the separation between its effective doses for the hypnotic and ataxic effects was the largest among the hypnotics tested. In the displacement study on [3H]flumazenil binding to cerebellar and spinal cord membranes, lormetazepam bound with a higher affinity to omega 1 receptor (Ki = 10 nM) than to omega 2 receptor (Ki = 29 nM). The GABA-ratios of lormetazepam to omega 1 and omega 2 receptors were 3.9 and 4.0, respectively; and they were higher and lower than those of flunitrazepam to omega 1 and omega 2 receptors, respectively. In the displacement study on [3H] Ro5-4864 binding to kidney membranes, lormetazepam bound with a lower affinity to the omega 3 receptor (Ki = 213 nM) than flunitrazepam. Thus, lormetazepam was suggested to be a potent hypnotic with weaker ataxic effects than other BZ hypnotics, which may be due to its selective and potent agonistic action on central omega 1 receptors.", 
    "53": "It is usually considered that the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy is due to the induction of a seizure (20). Benzodiazepines are well known antiepileptics (11) and it is suggested that they should be withdrawn during electroconvulsive therapy (3). The purpose of our study was to determine the evidence that exists for this hypothesis in the literature.", 
    "54": "We have reviewed the international literature on electroconvulsive therapy and benzodiazepines through the Medline and Pascal reference database, and performed a manual search of the major international journals. We have retained the references dealing with both benzodiazepine and electroconvulsive therapy.", 
    "55": "Up to June 1990, 16 references have been found (table I). Of these 16 references, 5 (6, 7, 12, 19, 25) are letters to the editor with no data reported. Six papers (1, 2, 8, 9, 14, 22) examine benzodiazepines as anesthetics and only focus on anesthetic variables, ignoring electroconvulsive therapy-treatment outcome. Only four studies (5, 17, 23, 24) actually examine the incidence of benzodiazepine use on electroconvulsive therapy. Of these, three studies (17, 23, 24) report the incidence of benzodiazepines used as tranquilizers or hypnotics on duration of the electroconvulsive therapy induced seizure. One is a retrospective study (24) showing a decrease in seizure duration due to benzodiazepine use. Of the two prospective studies one shows (23) no difference in seizure duration and the other one (17) a decrease. These studies, however, fail to actually examine how the antidepressive efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy is modified by benzodiazepine use. One recent study (5) measures the antidepressive efficacy of electro-convulsive therapy through the decrease of a validated depression scale. This is a randomized double-blind study examining a short acting benzodiazepine used as an anesthetic in lieu of methohexital. Electroconvulsive therapy efficacy does not appear impaired.", 
    "56": "From our review of the literature it appears that the supposed negative effect of benzodiazepines on the antidepressive action of electroconvulsive therapy has not been demonstrated. Further studies are necessary warranted.", 
    "57": "Abnormalities (dysmorphism, mental retardation etc) were reported (The Lancet 1987; i: 108-9) in children of mothers using high doses of benzodiazepines regularly during pregnancy in the area of Sweden with the highest use of benzodiazepines (Gothenburg). This signal was investigated in Sweden by use of available drug data bases, and in the USA by use of computerized health care data in Medicaid, including drugs and diagnoses. Neither the Swedish survey, nor the preliminary analysis of the pediatric profiles in the US-Medicaid population supported the occurrence of drug-associated abnormalities as described in The Lancet. Also, no significant findings were seen in a survey in Czechoslovakia on behavioural changes in children, whose mothers used diazepam during the second part of their pregnancy. Although available pharmacoepidemiology data do not confirm the hypothesis, this review points to existing geographic differences in use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy (frequency of chronic use and dosage level) and their potential clinical consequences. (Fig. 1, Ref. 25).", 
    "58": "The relative efficacy of competitive and noncompetitive excitatory amino acid antagonists in preventing hypoxic neuronal injury recently was examined in vitro. Immature (26 days post-conception) fetal mouse cerebral cortical cell cultures were exposed 10 days after plating to 5% oxygen for 24 hrs and returned to normoxia. After hypoxic insult, cultures were either not treated or the medium was supplemented with the competitive excitatory amino acid antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (2-APV), gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulphonate (DGAMS), or the noncompetitive antagonist methyl-10,11-dihydro-5-H-dibenzocyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801). By 48 hrs after restitution of normoxia, untreated hypoxic cultures evidenced severe neuronal deterioration, elevated LDH concentrations in the medium, depressed benzodiazepine receptor binding, and reduced GABA and glutamate uptake. Enhanced glial cell activity was reflected by modestly elevated glutamine synthetase activity. In hypoxic cultures treated with 2-APV (10 microM) or DGAMS (30 microM), neuronal morphology and biochemical profiles were both improved significantly when compared to both untreated hypoxic cultures and also to those treated with MK-801; 2-APV provided greater, although incomplete, protection. MK-801, at the highest nonneurotoxic concentration (25 nM), did not improve neuronal viability when compared to untreated controls. These results suggest that competitive excitatory amino acid antagonists are superior to noncompetitive antagonists in preventing hypoxic neuronal injury to developing neurons in vitro. MK-801, at low concentrations, produced significant neurotoxicity without improving cell survival.", 
    "59": "Meta-analysis of 19 double-blind placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants (N = 13) and benzodiazepines (N = 6) for patients with panic disorders showed that active treatment had 25% greater success rate than placebo over a mean duration of 14 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences observed between treatment sub-groups (antidepressants--mean duration 16 weeks; and benzodiazepines--mean duration 7 weeks). On this basis antidepressants and benzodiazepines prescribed in clinical settings are likely to be equally effective in the short-term treatment of people with panic disorders.", 
    "60": "Reports on the effects of benzodiazepines in schizophrenia have appeared since the early 1960s. Conclusions drawn from these studies, most of which have been uncontrolled, have ranged from worse than placebo to better than neuroleptics. A critical appraisal of the literature seems to warrant the following main conclusions. Benzodiazepines alone, in conventional doses, have no convincing antipsychotic effect in schizophrenia, although they may reduce anxiety, tension and insomnia. However, very high doses of diazepam, and possibly other benzodiazepines, may have a symptomatic antipsychotic effect, especially in paranoid-hallucinatory schizophrenics, also when given alone. Benzodiazepines, in conventional doses, can enhance the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics in schizophrenics who have not responded satisfactorily to neuroleptics alone. This effect may be most conspicuous against hallucinations, but improvement may also be obtained from delusions, thought disturbances, some negative symptoms, anxiety and tension. Some benzodiazepines may be more effective than others in schizophrenia, but this has been insufficiently elucidated.", 
    "61": "The spectrum and time course of different symptoms during alcohol withdrawal may be caused by the involvement of various neurotransmitter systems that are differentially vulnerable to the effects of ethanol. Withdrawal symptomatology results from increased activity of excitatory mechanisms (NMDA-receptor, catecholamines among others) and from reduced functioning of inhibitory receptors (GABAA-, alpha 2-adreno-receptor among others). The neuronal mechanisms are subject to different dynamics of restitution following intoxication. Some of these probably contribute to long-lasting changes in CNS functions by \"kindling\" processes. Therapeutic guidelines are deduced from results of basic research and clinical trials. It is concluded that clomethiazole and benzodiazepines are superior in treating delirium tremens and certain risk-patients, whereas carbamazepine and clonidine may be helpful in moderate withdrawal syndromes or as adjunctive agents. However, the need for improved methodological standards of method in clinical research is evident.", 
    "62": "Both noradrenergic (NE) and serotonergic (5-HT) systems have been implicated in anxiety and depression, as well as in the therapeutic actions of drugs treating these conditions. We have used microelectrode recordings of nerve cell impulse frequencies and in vivo voltammetric recordings of monoamine release to evaluate effects of the arylpiperazine 5-HT1A anxiolytics, buspirone and ipsapirone. Both buspirone and ipsapirone significantly depressed 5-HT neuronal firing rates in dorsal raphe (DR), but significantly increased NE neuronal firing rates in locus coeruleus (LC). In CA1 region of hippocampus, both buspirone and ipsapirone significantly depressed NE release with potencies greater than those required for the significant depression of 5-HT release. It is concluded that, contrary to the belief that the 5-HT1A arylpiperazines act primarily through 5-HT mechanisms, alterations in NE function may be critically important for their therapeutic effects, just as is the case for the benzodiazepine anxiolytics and the tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "63": "The purpose of this paper is to highlight some of the social issues and policy developments which have set the \"service provision agenda\" for those who have experienced problems with tranquilizers. It covers three main areas: (1) key issues in considering the social context of tranquilizer use; (2) the development of services for drug misusers including tranquilizer users, and (3) the service response at the grass-roots level within a public health context. The implication of these discussions is that there is an urgent need to link policy with practice as well as resource management with service provision.", 
    "64": "Agitation is a common phenomenon in critically ill patients. This multidimensional challenge can prolong illness, interfere with treatment, and harm the patient. The nurse must assess the cause of the agitation and provide effective, timely intervention. Agitation is defined as motor restlessness secondary to possible physiologic, psychologic, environmental, and pharmacologic causes. The nurse has many effective assessment tools to systematically determine the cause of the agitation, including an agitation algorithm and sedation scale. With astute assessment and intervention, agitation can be prevented and treated to enhance recovery from critical illness. Benzodiazepines are an effective treatment intervention for agitation. With thorough knowledge of the actions and potential effects of these drugs, the nurse can provide the best pharmacologic intervention to treat agitation in the critically ill patient.", 
    "65": "Attitudes and beliefs of physicians and nurses have shifted during the past decade, resulting in more frequent administration of analgesics and sedatives to neonates. However, nurses caring for critically ill newborns have difficulty in determining appropriate interventions because of the lack of clear and complete knowledge related to the use of analgesia and sedation in this patient population. This chapter presents current information on six key issues related to the use of analgesia and sedation in neonates. An algorithm for determining appropriate intervention for neonates with pain, distress, or agitation is proposed to provide a more systematic approach to the use of analgesics and sedatives.", 
    "66": "To assess the influence of adrenergic modulation on preoperative anxiety, we used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare temazepam, clonidine, and timolol as preanesthetic medications in patients undergoing minor orthopedic surgery. All the active treatments resulted in less preoperative anxiety than the placebo (control) did. Induction of anesthesia was smoother in all the treated patients compared with the control group. Recovery was slowest in the temazepam and clonidine groups, but there were no significant differences between the groups after 90 min. Cardiovascular changes were most marked in the timolol group. Pain scores were lower in the temazepam and clonidine series in the early postoperative period. Neither clonidine nor timolol offers any major advantage over temazepam for premedication in these patients.", 
    "67": "The mechanism of action of bombesin, also known as gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), on somatostatin secretion was examined separately in superfused segments of rat antral and fundic mucosa. Bombesin/GRP (1 nM) stimulated somatostatin secretion from both regions. In fundic segments, the somatostatin response was strongly inhibited (86%; P less than 0.01) by tetrodotoxin (5 microM) but augmented by atropine (1 microM) (P less than 0.01). In antral segments, both tetrodotoxin and atropine augmented the somatostatin response to bombesin/GRP by 42-45% (P less than 0.01), whereas the gastrin antagonist L 365260 (1 microM) abolished it. The gastrin antagonist augmented the gastrin response to bombesin/GRP by 103% (P less than 0.01). The results indicate that bombesin/GRP stimulates somatostatin secretion by distinct mechanisms in the fundus and antrum. In the fundus, bombesin/GRP acts indirectly on somatostatin cells by activating stimulatory noncholinergic neurons and, to a lesser extent, inhibitory cholinergic neurons. In the antrum, bombesin/GRP acts indirectly on somatostatin cells by stimulating release of gastrin and, to a lesser extent, by activating inhibitory cholinergic neurons. A dual paracrine pathway links gastrin and somatostatin secretion in the antrum.", 
    "68": "Receptor autoradiography was used to study the laminar distribution of excitatory amino acid, GABA(A), and GABA(B) binding sites in human striate cortex. Binding sites for all these receptor subtypes were found within striate cortex, but there were marked differences in the laminar distribution of binding sites. NMDA binding sites were most dense in layers 1-4C, with highest density in layer 4C and lower levels in layers 5 and 6. Among non-NMDA binding sites, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid binding sites had highest levels in layers 1-3, intermediate levels in layers 5 and 6, and lowest levels in layers 4B and 4C. Kainate and metabotropic binding sites were more uniformly distributed across cortical laminae, with a trend toward highest kainate binding in layers 5 and 6. GABA(A)/benzodiazepine binding sites had highest levels in layers 2, 3, and 4C, with intermediate levels in 4B and lowest levels in layers 1, 5, and 6. GABA(B) binding sites were uniformly distributed across laminae. There was no evidence of a \"columnar\" or \"blob\" pattern of any binding site within any of the laminae. With the exception of kainate, metabotropic excitatory amino acid, and GABA(B) binding sites, the laminar distribution of binding sites within striate cortex was different than that seen in adjacent visual cortex.", 
    "69": "Platelet activating factor (PAF) is ubiquitous in mammals, and may have multiple functions in the central nervous system. Triazolobenzodiazepine compounds are active both at the GABAA receptor and as PAF antagonists. To investigate whether PAF antagonist activity is involved in the actions of triazolobenzodiazepines, we examined effects of two non-benzodiazepine PAF antagonists on binding and function at the GABAA receptor. The gingkolide terpene, BN 52021 and the dioxolane-based compound BN 52115 had no effect on benzodiazepine binding or chloride channel binding in cortical membrane preparations. However, chloride uptake into cortical synaptoneurosomes was enhanced with 1 microM BN 52021 but not 1 microM BN 52115. The effect of BN 52021 was prevented by 1 microM flumazenil. PAF antagonists appear to augment GABAA receptor function without affecting binding.", 
    "70": "Experiments were performed with mice to determine whether doses of the benzodiazepine, flurazepam, or the GABA uptake inhibitor, NO-328, known to potentiate catalepsy induced by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), would also interact synergistically with THC in the production of certain other effects. No synergism was detected either in the production of antinociception (tail flick test) or in a test in which the ability of flurazepam to delay onset of clonic convulsions induced by intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazole was compared in the presence and absence of THC or cannabidiol. The hypothermic effect of THC was unaffected by NO-328 but enhanced by flurazepam, albeit only at doses higher than those needed to potentiate THC-induced catalepsy. In vitro experiments with guinea pig ileum showed that the ability of THC to inhibit electrically evoked contractions was unaffected by delta-amino-n-valeric acid, a GABA(B) receptor antagonist, and that preparations rendered tolerant to GABA responded normally to THC. Contractions induced by GABA in unstimulated ileal longitudinal muscle were attenuated by THC. We conclude that there is little evidence from our data that any of the THC effects studied were GABA mediated.", 
    "71": "Peripheral benzodiazepine (PBD) receptors are localized on the mitochondrial membrane and are highly expressed in brain tumors compared to normal brain. To elucidate the biological role of the PBD receptor on mitochondria, we examined the effect of PBDs on mitochondrial morphology in C6 and T98G glioma cells using rhodamine 123 and quantitative electron microscopy. In cells incubated in serum-free medium alone, mitochondria were distributed in a filamentous pattern throughout the cytoplasm. By contrast, the mitochondria aggregated in the perinuclear region in PK11195 or Ro5-4864 (10 nM) treated cells. Quantitative electron micrography revealed a 250% increased in the number of mitochondria with elongated cristae and a fivefold increase in dividing mitochondria in PK11195-treated cells compared with cells incubated in serum-free medium alone. PBD treatment also resulted in vacuolation within the matrix and mitochondrial swelling. These data suggest that PBDs influence mitochondrial morphology and induce mitochondrial replication in cultured glioma cells.", 
    "72": "1. The interaction of the intravenous general anaesthetic propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) with the GABAA receptor has been investigated in voltage-clamped bovine chromaffin cells and rat cortical neurones in cell culture. Additionally, the effects of propofol on the glycine and GABAA receptors of murine spinal neurones were determined. 2. Propofol (1.7-16.8 microM) reversibly and dose-dependently potentiated the amplitude of membrane currents elicited by GABA (100 microM) applied locally to bovine chromaffin cells. Intracellular application of propofol (16.8 microM) was ineffective. In rat cortical neurones and murine spinal neurones, extracellular application of 8.4 microM and 1.7-16.8 microM propofol respectively produced a potentiation of GABA-evoked currents qualitatively similar to that seen in the bovine chromaffin cell. 3. The potentiation by propofol (1.7 microM) was not associated with a change in the reversal potential of the GABA-evoked whole cell current. On outside-out membrane patches isolated from bovine chromaffin cells, propofol (1.7 microM) had little or no effect on the GABA single channel conductances, but greatly increased the probability of the GABA-gated channel being in the conducting state. 4. The potentiation of GABA-evoked whole cell currents by propofol (1.7 microM) was not influenced by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (0.3 microM). A concentration of propofol (1.7 microM) that substantially potentiated GABA currents had little effect on currents induced by the activation of the GABAA receptor by pentobarbitone (1 mM). 5. Bath application of propofol (8.4-252 microM), to bovine chromaffin cells voltage clamped at -60 mV, induced an inward current associated with an increase in membrane current noise on all cells sensitive to GABA. Intracellular application of propofol (16.8 microM) was ineffective in this respect. Local application of propofol (600 microM) induced whole cell currents with a reversal potential dependent upon the Cl- gradient across the cell membrane. 6. On outside-out membrane patches formed from bovine chromaffin cells, propofol (30 microM) induced single channels with mean chord conductances of 29 and 12 pS. The frequency of propofol channels was greatly reduced by coapplication of 1 microM bicuculline. Under identical ionic conditions, GABA (1 microM) activated single channels with mean chord conductances of 33, 16 and 10pS. 7. Bath applied propofol (0.84-16.8 microM) dose-dependently potentiated strychnine-sensitive currents evoked by glycine (100 microM) in murine spinal neurones. 8. The relevance of the present results to the general anaesthetic action of propofol is discussed.", 
    "73": "Polyclonal antibodies raised to synthetic amino acid sequences of the rat gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor alpha 1-, alpha 2- and alpha 3-subunits selectively recognized single proteins with apparent molecular weight 51 kDa (P51), 53 kDa (P53) and 59 kDa (P59), respectively, in GABAA receptor preparations affinity purified from the brains of 5-10-day-old rats. The antibodies were coupled to Affigel 10, and the resulting immunoaffinity columns were used to isolate these proteins from affinity purified GABAA receptors.", 
    "74": "Most antidepressant therapies require an initial period of sustained use before therapeutic effects are observed; the literature suggests that this may be due to alterations in either serotonergic or noradrenergic systems. To further explore the mechanism of action of antidepressants, the effect of 21-day drug treatment to rats on serotonin type 2 and beta-adrenergic receptors in fronto-parietal hemicortices was evaluated. Because the same brain was used to measure concomitant changes in both receptors, confounding effects due to inter-animal variability are reduced. The effect of a classical antidepressant drug, desmethylimipramine, was compared with two compounds which have more recently been used to treat depression, ie., adinazolam, a tirazolobenzodiazepine, and buspirone, a serotonin type 1A partial agonist, both of which possesses combined anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. The anxiolytic drug diazepam, a benzodiazepine devoid of antidepressant properties, was used as an active control treatment. Membrane binding studies showed that the maximal binding of [125I]cyanopindolol to beta-adrenoceptors was significantly decreased only by desmethylimipramine treatment. On the other hand, adinazolam and buspirone, as well as desmethylimipramine, decreased the maximal binding of [125I]7-amino-8-iodo-ketanserin binding to serotonin type 2 receptors. Diazepam was without effect on either receptor. These results suggest that down-regulation of serotonin type 2 receptors may be a common element in the mechanism of action of antidepressant therapies.", 
    "75": "Diazepam, which binds both central (neuronal) and peripheral (non-neuronal) benzodiazepine binding sites, and Ro5-4864, a ligand selective for benzodiazepine peripheral binding sites (PBS), both inhibited the FMLP induced chemotaxis in human neutrophils at concentrations as low as 10(-8) M. A selective peripheral benzodiazepine antagonist, PK-11195 (10(-5) M), partially reversed the benzodiazepine inhibition of chemotaxis. Diazepam also inhibited the superoxide production induced by FMLP, NaF, and A23187, but not that induced by PMA whose stimulant action was insensitive even to 10(-4) M diazepam. The FMLP-induced superoxide production was most sensitive to diazepam inhibition (ID50 = 2.25 x 10(-6) M diazepam); the effect of NaF was slightly less sensitive (ID50 = 1.34 x 10(-5) M diazepam); and the effect of A23187 was least sensitive as it was suppressed only at 10(-4) M diazepam concentrations. Like diazepam, Ro5-4864 inhibited the FMLP-induced superoxide production, and PK-11195 (10(-5) M) significantly antagonized both diazepam and Ro5-4864 inhibition. Binding studies showed the presence of a saturable benzodiazepine 'peripheral' type binding site (PBS) on human neutrophils with a Kd of 1.2 +/- 0.06 x 10(-8) M (+/- SEM), and a Bmax of 1028 +/- 86.2 fmol/10(6) cells (+/- SEM) for [3H]Ro5-4864; the binding was displaceable by PK-11195, Ro5-4864 and diazepam but not by clonazepam.", 
    "76": "Emission computed tomographic methods for the in vivo quantification of radioligand-binding sites in human brain have previously been limited either by a lack of correction for possible effects of altered ligand transport or by highly complicated physiological models that preclude display of binding data in a detailed anatomical format. We investigated the application of a simplified compartmental model to the kinetic analysis of in vivo ligand binding to central benzodiazepine receptors. The human brain distribution of [11C]flumazenil, as determined by dynamic positron emission tomography, combined with metabolite-corrected arterial blood samples, permitted estimations of local cerebral ligand transport and of receptor binding. This approach allows calculation of transport and binding \"maps\" on a pixel-by-pixel basis, resulting in the display of binding data in a familiar tomographic format while maintaining much of the physiological accuracy inherent in more complex methods. The results obtained in a study of 6 normal volunteers revealed good interindividual precision, with coefficients of variation between 10 and 15% of mean regional values, suggesting the utility of this approach in future clinical studies of benzodiazepine receptor binding.", 
    "77": "1. The entire central nervous system (CNS) of the newly born, South American opossum (Monodelphis domestica) was isolated and maintained in basal medium, Eagle's (BME) with 0.2% foetal calf serum and antibiotics. Isolated CNS preparations remained electrically excitable for up to 10 days. The fine structure of the spinal cord was normal after 5 days in culture: axons, synapses, dendrites and glia were virtually unchanged. Signs of degeneration were evident only in dorsal areas of the spinal cord, which had been denervated by removal of the dorsal root ganglia during dissection. 2. Amino acid transmitters such as glycine, glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), applied to the bathing fluid, rapidly and reversibly inhibited synaptic transmission in cervical segments of the spinal cord. GABA (10-100 mumol l-1) produced a dose-dependent reduction in the magnitude of ventral root responses evoked by dorsal root stimulation. GABA also inhibited synaptically activated compound action potentials produced by spinal cord stimulation. Dose-response curves for GABA obtained in different preparations were highly reproducible. 3. Both GABAA and GABAB receptors were reversibly activated by selective agonists and inhibited by specific antagonists. The actions of GABA were potentiated by benzodiazepines, competitively antagonised by bicuculline (a selective GABAA antagonist) and mimicked by muscimol (a GABAA agonist). Baclofen (a specific GABAB agonist) also inhibited electrical activity and was competitively antagonised by the GABAB antagonist, CGP 35348. 4. After 5 days of culture in BME or minimal essential medium (MEM), GABA dose-response curves were unchanged from those observed immediately after removal of the CNS. The inhibitory potency of baclofen was also unaffected by culture in BME. By contrast, after 5 days of culture in MEM, baclofen no longer inhibited electrical activity. This difference between BME and MEM could be attributed to the higher content of L-histidine in MEM. Thus, addition of 150 mumol l-1 L-histidine to BME produced similar results to culture in MEM: the inhibitory action of baclofen was virtually abolished after 3-5 days. L-Histidine had no effect on freshly dissected preparations. Chronic application of L-histidine did not affect glycine or glutamate responses after 5 days. Addition of D-histidine or other amino acids, such as arginine, to BME did not abolish the responses to baclofen. 5. These results show that the isolated CNS of the newborn opossum survives well in long-term culture and that it provides a useful preparation to study receptor development and plasticity of an intact mammalian CNS in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "78": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor gamma 2-subunit is important for benzodiazepine action. In previous studies, two forms of gamma 2-subunit have been found which are generated by RNA alternative splicing (gamma 2L and gamma 2S) and differ by the presence or absence of an 8-amino acid insertion in the major intracellular loop between proposed transmembrane domains M3 and M4. We have used the RNase protection assay to study regulation of expression of the two forms of gamma 2-subunit in mouse brain, as judged from mRNA levels. We find that gamma 2L and gamma 2S are differentially expressed in brain regions and that gamma 2S is expressed at a fairly constant level during brain development while gamma 2L increases dramatically with maturation. Their differentially regulated expression suggests further that gamma 2L and gamma 2S form receptors with important functional differences.", 
    "79": "Chronic morphine treatment produced increases in [3H]-flunitrazepam binding in some hippocampal areas of the rat brain. The differences in binding were statistically significant in some cases. Both morphine-dependent and morphine-deprived (abstinence syndrome) animals showed an identical response in binding, which confirms a real, although small, increase in benzodiazepine binding sites in the hippocampus after morphine treatment, that is not affected by a naloxone-induced abstinence syndrome under the conditions studied. These findings support the hypothesis of a morphine-induced up-regulation of benzodiazepine binding sites in the hippocampus. A possible different response in benzodiazepine binding sites 1 and 2 could explain the different findings reported in the literature. Our data suggest that the detected increase in benzodiazepine binding would be mainly due to type 2 binding sites, since the hippocampus has a higher density of this type of benzodiazepine binding sites."
