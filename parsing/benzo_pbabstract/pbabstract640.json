    "0": "High-affinity binding of 3H-diazepam and 3H-flunitrazepam has provided evidence for the presence of benzodiazepine receptors on brain neurones. Pharmacological evidence showing a clear correlation between receptor affinity and in vivo pharmacological potency for several benzodiazepines and a link between benzodiazepine receptors and GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptors at the molecular level, indicates that these receptors are relevant to the pharmacological and clinical effects of benzodiazepines. In searching for possible endogeneous ligands for benzodiazepine receptors we have recently isolated ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) found human urine and brain, and shown that beta-CCE has a higher affinity than diazepam for brain benzodiazepine receptors. beta-CCE itself is probably not present in the brain, but may be closely related to an endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand. We report here that beta-CCE, in contrast to benzodiazepines, can distinguish clearly between benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellum and hippocampus. This result strongly indicates that benzodiazepine receptors are not a single class of non-interacting entities. It has not been possible to determine whether two distinct receptors are present and/or whether true negative cooperativity exists among hippocampal, but not cerebellar, benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "1": "Two chromatographic methods are proposed for separation, identification and determination of dibenzoazepines and benzodiazepines. A micro thin-layer method has been developed and transposed to give an HPLC system, which requires a slight modilfication of the solvent. Retention data are given, and two quantitative applications arc described.", 
    "2": "Ketamine infusion anaesthesia was studied in rats breathing oxygen/helium under hyperbaric conditions from 1 to 90 ATA. No pressure reversal of the analgesic effect was found. Premedication with diazepam failed to improve the analgesic action of ketamine, but influenced the respiratory pattern. Blood-gas analyses showed a marked relationship between arterial pH and the ketamine dose requirement for stable anaesthesia.", 
    "3": "1. Salivary, unbound and total plasma levels of diazepam have been compared in nineteen subjects. 2. Salivary diazepam levels were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than, but closely related to the corresponding unbound levels (r = 0.97) at 2.5-3 h after administration of the drug. 3. The results presented suggest that saliva levels can be used to predict the corresponding plasma levels at a given time, but there is no 1:1 relation between the unbound diazepam concentration in plasma and the saliva level of the drug.", 
    "4": "Two male and two female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were the subjects of an experiment designed to assess the effect of d-amphetamine (DA; 0.125, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg, IM) and diazepam (DZP; 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, IM) on food-getting behavior in paired and group competition. Paired competition results show that in some cases submissive animals, that had previously failed to obtain apple pieces, were successful in obtaining some apple pieces when either the dominant animal of the pair or both subjects were given 0.5 mg/kg DA or 2.5 mg/kg DZP. Results revealed the same effect when all animals (group competition) were given 0.125 and 2.0 mg/kg DA and 2.5 mg/kg DZP. These results appear to indicate that the effect of drugs on food-getting behavior in competitive situations is in some manner influenced by the social status of the animal.", 
    "5": "We have studied chlordiazepoxide (Librium) disposition and elimination in eight normal subjects before and after 1 week of cimetidine therapy, 300 mg orally four times a day. Cimetidine strikingly impaired the clearance of chlordiazepoxide from plasma, and this was, at least in part, due to decreased demethylation of the drug to N-desmethylchlordiazepoxide. Since the volume of distribution of chlordiazepoxide was not altered by cimetidine, the elimination half-life of chlordiazepoxide was also significantly prolonged by cimetidine therapy.", 
    "6": "The significant occurrence of thrombophlebitis in patients administered diazepam intravenously was described recently. This side effect has been attributed to the crystallization of diazepam and its subsequent precipitation upon contact with blood or intravenous fluids. The current study was designed to reveal whether the solubilizing capability of poloxamer 188 reduces the incidence of thrombotic and inflammatory effects of diazepam in rabbits. The incidence of early (3-hr) ear vein necrosis was 72% in the diazepam-treated ears, while the incidence of necrosis in the ears that received poloxamer 188 as a vehicle for diazepam was 25%. The occurrence of thrombosis and loss of vessel integrity also was higher in diazepam-treated ears than in those treated with diazepam plus poloxamer 188. Solubilization of diazepam with poloxamer 188 may decrease the incidence of the tested side effects.", 
    "7": "The serum protein binding of three weakly acidic drugs (salicylic acid, sulfisoxazole, and phenytoin), one week base (diazepam), and one steroid (dexamethasone) was determined in pregnant women at seven time periods during pregnancy and at two periods post partum, as well as in a group of nonpregnant women of childbearing age. The serum free fraction values (ratio of concentrations, free to total drug) of all drugs rose during pregnancy, primarily after 15 wk of gestation, and remained elevated for at least 1 to 5 days post partum. Pregnancy had the greatest effect on protein binding of sulfisoxazole, diazepam, and salicylic acid. The magnitude of this effect is such that quantitatively significant changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of certain drugs may be expected to occur during pregnancy (in addition to possible changes caused by other pregnancy-related effects such as altered activity of drug-metabolizing enzyme systems). All drugs but dexamethasone exhibited significant negative correlations between free fraction values and serum albumin concentrations during pregnancy. The serum protein binding of salicylic acid, but not the other drugs tested, was more extensive in nonpregnant women who were not taking oral contraceptives than in those who were.", 
    "8": "Five healthy male subjects, aged 26 to 35 yr, received single oral doses of clonidine 0.3 mg, nitrazepam 20 mg, or placebo double-blind with an interval of at least 1 wk between each treatment. Clonodine induced a maximal fall in systo9lic blood pressure from 104.2 +/- 1.6 to 84.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) after 3.5 hr and nitrazepam from 102.9 +/- 1.9 to 90.3 +/- 2.6 mm Hg after 1.0 hr while after placebo blood pressure rose steadily from 102.5 +/- 2.9 to 109.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg at the end of the 8-hr study. Total sleep time increased from 90.3 +/- 2.5. min after placebo to 256.2 +/0 21.0 min after clonidine (p < 0.001) and 281.0 +/- 40.3 min after nitrazepam (p < 0.001). Stage I sleep increased from 49.7 +/- 11.2 to 76.9 +/- 10.2 min after clonidine and to 76.3 +/- 25.2 min after nitrazepam (p < 0.0), while the greatest increase was observed in stage II: 230.7 +/- 25.6 min after clonidine and 236.6 +/- 35.4 min after nitrazepam compared with only 48.5 +/- 15.8 min after placebo (p < 0.001). Plasma norepinephrine did not change after placebo but fell after nitrazepam from 0.28 +/- 0.04 to 0.14 +/- 0.02 ng/ml after 3 hr (p < 0.05) and after clonidine from 0.23 +/- 0.07 to 0.07 +/- 0.02 ng/ml after 2 hr (p < 0.01). Clonidine and nitrazepam both induced similar hypnotic and hypotensive effects with some evidence that this might be due to a reduction in sympathetic tone.", 
    "9": "Five benzodiazepines, flurazepam, nitrazepam, diazepam, oxazepam, and chlordiazepoxide, have been tested for porphyrin-inducing activity in chick embryo liver cell culture and for delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase inducing activity in the 17-day-old chick embryo. Flurazepam and nitrazepam were found to have considerably lower potency than secobarbital whereas diazepam, oxazepam, and chlordiazepoxide were less potent than phenobarbital in these test systems. The following conclusions were arrived at. (1) A hypnotic dose of flurazepam or nitrazepam would be less likely than a comparable dose of secobarbital to increase ALA synthetase activity in a patient with hereditary hepatic porphyria. (2) A sedative dose of diazepam, oxazepam, or chlordiazepoxide would be less likely than a comparable dose of phenobarbital to increase ALA synthetase activity in a patient with hereditary hepatic porphyria. (3) The benzodiazepines, although apparently less likely to precipitate an attack than barbiturates, should be used with great caution in porphyria patients.", 
    "10": "A new simplified technique recording readaptation time after photo stress, RAT, is described. The psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency and retest reliability were tested, and the effect on RAT after intake of melperon at two different dose levels was investigated and correlated to blood plasma levels. The results show that there was a satisfactory consistency of RAT at each occasion but stability over a 1 month period could not be demonstrated. Significantly dose-dependent changes were recorded after intake of melperon but the prolongation of RAT was not significantly correlated to blood plasma levels.", 
    "11": "A brief survey of the techniques of intravenous conscious-sedation for full dentition, all inclusive periodontal surgery is presented as used for 5200 patients. Diazepam, meperidine, and methohexital were employed in 3700 cases while diazepam plus methohexital was used in the remaining 1500 cases. Local infiltration and nerve block anesthesia were employed in all of the cases. Patients of wide age range having a physical status of I, II, or III underwent total periodontal surgery in one appointment. No major complications were noted. Patient and surgeon acceptance was excellent.", 
    "12": "Diazepam was given to weaned piglets intramuscularly (0.25 and 1.0 mg . kg-1), individually per os (2 mg . kg-1), or in feed mixture (5, 10, 15 mg . kg-1 of feed) either alone or in combination with phenobarbital (100 mg . kg-1 of feed). The highest tranquillizing effect of diazepam was obtained after the single administration of the intramuscular dose of 1 mg . kg-1, oral dose of 2 mg . kg-1, and after the intake of 0.65 mg together with 6.5 mg of phenobarbital per kg of body weight in feed during 22 hours. Adrenocortical activity, increased in the controls as a result of the stress from handling, was also blocked in these cases. The piglets which had consumed a dose of 0.66 mg of diazepam with feed during 14 days after weaning, or 0.26 and 0.34 mg of diazepam together with 5.2 and 3.4 mg phenobarbital per kg b. w., showed a manifest trend to a lower level of plasma corticoids. At repeated administration, the effect on body weight gains was not explicit; the addition of phenobarbital had no effect. No symptoms of intoxication or impairment to the metabolism of the main nutrients and vitamin A were observed. The suitability of diazepam for the tranquilization of piglets was demonstrated and the practical advantages of its administration in feed mixture were emphasized, the best time of administration being a day prior to handling which is expected to exert an adverse effect on pig production and to render human work difficult.", 
    "13": "Status epilepticus may end fatally or may leave serious sequelae. Thus the physician must act quickly and appropriately to stop convulsions using the methods described. Supportive measures--maintenance of airway, protection from harm, maintenance of vital functions--must be accomplished before drug therapy is started. Metabolic abnormalities must be corrected. Striving for levels of antiepileptic drugs in the upper therapeutic range is best, and the physician must be prepared to deal with the side-effects and complications of these medications.", 
    "14": "Our subjects were 15 young (aged 22 to 42 yr) and 14 elderly (aged 62 to 85 yr) people who took single oral doses of 20 mg prazepam. Plasma desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) concentrations were determined in venous blood samples drawn up to 9 days after the dose. Appearance in blood of DMDZ was slow, with peak plasma levels reached in an average of 10 to 20 hr. First-order DMDZ appearance was observed in only 17 subjects. Volume of distribution of total DMDZ (range, 1.33 to 6.30 l/kg) and of unbound DMDZ after correction for protein binding (range, 43 to 243 l/kg) was larger in women than in men of all ages, and in the elderly as opposed to the young. Elimination half-life (range, 29 to 224 hr) rose with age in men (r = 0.66, p < 0.01) but not in women (r = -0.02). Clearance of unbound DMDZ (range, 2.9 to 31.2 ml/min/kg) was greater in women than in men of all ages, and declined with age in men (r = -0.40) but not in women (r = -0.06). As in the case of diazepam, age can influence DMDZ kinetics, but changes in drug disposition with age may differ between sexes.", 
    "15": "The ECoG and behavioural effects of administering 3 benzodiazepines (diazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam) were tested in baboons restrained in a chair, with arms fastened (a situation which is considered 'anxiogenic'). Considering our previous data with ECoG recording of focal rhythms from area somatic I, the 3 drugs were revealed as 'anxiolytic'. Differences were noticed with respect to their hypnotic effects: no sleep was elicited under diazepam; a considerable amount of slow sleep was observed with lorazepam; nitrazepam produced a succession of short waking/sleep cycles.", 
    "16": "The sedative-hypnotic secobarbital and the sedative-anti-anxiety agent, chlordiazepoxide and two neuroleptics, chlorpromazine and halopridol, were treated for effects on the EEG of the cat using broad-band frequency analysis of 6 brain sites. Dose-related, 'drug-=specific' effects were abstracted from the data by the use of multivariate statistical techniques. These demonstrated that the two neuroleptic agents produced very similar alterations in the EEG frequency spectrum which were distinctly different from those resulting from the administration of the sedative-hypnotic and the sedative-anti-anxiety agent. The time-course of the central activity of the 4 compounds was also depicted.", 
    "17": "Effects of a new minor tranquilizer, CS-386 and diazepam were studied upon the gastric contraction and excitation of lumbar gamma-motoneurons following stimulation of some of the brain structures as well as upon the spontaneous gastric motility in the cat. CS-386 inhibited the hypothalamus-induced gastric contraction with little changes in spontaneous motility at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (i.d.). Diazepam inhibited both the hypothalamus-induced contraction and spontaneous motility at these doses. The vagal nerve-induced gastric contraction was suppressed by diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.d.) but not by the same dose of CS-386. Bemegride (5 mg/kg, i.v.) antagonized almost completely the depression caused by 5 mg/kg of CS-386, but not that by a dose of 10 mg/kg or 5 as well as 10 mg/kg of diazepam. Excitation of the lumbar gamma-motoneuron following stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus or the mesencephalic reticular formation was depressed by CS-386 or diazepam (10 mg/kg, p.o.), but not by lower doses. Based on the these evidences, it was suggested that CS-386 could be effective in stress-induced gastric lesions with lower side effects in digestive organs than diazepam.", 
    "18": "A certain minimum in the duration of seizures appears to be a condition for a satisfactory therapeutic effect in ECT. The aim of the present investigation is to elucidate the importance of some factors which may influence the seizure duration. In a controlled double-blind investigation with crossover, carried out on 19 patients, thiopentone and methohexitone were compared as anaesthetics for unilateral ECT. No differences were found between the anaesthetics regarding duration of seizures, number of treatments with insufficient seizures duration or amount of energy applied. Blood pressure measured after the seizure was slightly higher with thiopentone than with methohexitone and methohexitone as anaesthetic for ECT. In a retrospective investigation concerning seizure duration in unilateral ECT, patients given benzodiazepines during the treatment period were compared with patients who received no such medication. The benzodiazepine group showed shorter seizure duration, more cases with insufficient seizure duration and a need for a greater number of treatments. Benzodiazepines should be administered with caution during ECT, as they can impair the efficacy of treatments and consequently prolong the treatment period.", 
    "19": "Patients undergoing surgery under regional anaesthesia often prefer to be sedated and do not later want to recall the procedure. One hundred and twenty-one patients scheduled for various surgical procedures under epidural, spinal, sacral, or brachial plexus blockades received 1 mg/kg of pethidine, 0.007 mg/kg of scopolamine, plus 0.14 mg/kg of morphine, or 0.03 mg/kg or 0.06 mg/kg or lorazepam intramuscularly as preanaesthetic medication before the operation. The patients's self-assessments of degree of fatigue and apprehension were similar after each premedication when assessed before operation. Postoperative anxiety and confusion as well as need for postoperative care and supervision were greatest after 0.06mg/kg of lorazepam. Significantly (P smaller than 0.05 to P smaller than 0.01) fewer patients given 0.06 mg/kg or lorazepam remembered different events and procedures carried out on them before and after operation than those given other premedications, but no significant differences were noted in patients' ability to recall the performance of operation when asked on the following day. Seventy-seven, 63, and 57% of patients receiving 0.06 mg/kg of lorazepam remembered the start of blockade, performance of operation, and stay in recovery room, respectively. Intravenous sedation should be preferred to these intramuscularly administered premedications if drug-induced amnesia is sought to supplement local anaesthetic techniques.", 
    "20": "Benzodiazepine derivatives are neuropharmacologically similar but may appear clinically distinct due to pharmacokinetic differences. The clinical effects of single doses depend mainly on rates of drug absorption and distribution, whereas drug accumulation is a major determinant of clinical action during multiple dosage. This paper outlines potential clinical implications of benzodiazepine pharmacokinetics.", 
    "21": "Anxiety seems to be an inherent and perhaps necessary component of civilization. However, the biological basis of anxiety has always been as obscure as the definition of anxiety itself. The importance of anxiety to our mental well-being was noted by Freud (1933) who considered it a \"nodal point\". As in the case of schizophrenia, there have been as many hypotheses to explain anxiety as there have been investigators with different techniques for studying it. The benzodiazepines, introduced clinically in 1960, are now the most widely-used anxiolytic drugs. From the time of their introduction, it was felt that an explanation of the mode of action of benzodiazepines might shed considerable light on the basis of anxiety. The discovery, in 1977, of a specific benzodiazepine receptor, uniquely localized in the CNS, was the major turning point in this search.", 
    "22": "Temazepam, a benzodiazepine, hitherto used only as a hypnotic, was studied as a pre-anaesthetic medication in adult women undergoing minor gynaecological surgery in a dose of 30 mg and compared to 10 mg of diazepam. The sedative effect of temazepam was found to be superior to that of diazepam, using both objective and subjective criteria for assessment. There was also a highly significant degree of patient acceptance of the drug. It is suggested that temazepam is a suitable drug for premedication for minor surgery.", 
    "23": "The concentrations of lorazepam and its conjugate were determined in maternal venous serum, in umbilical vein and artery serum, and in amniotic fluid after a single 2 mg intramuscular and 2.5 mg oral maternal administration. During normal delivery (2 mg intramuscular injection) and caesarean section (2.5 mg orally) both the unconjugated and conjugated forms of lorazepam were found in the umbilical circulation and amniotic fluid. The serum protein unbound fraction was 14.0 +/- 4.8 (S.D.) % in maternal circulation and 20.8 +/- 3.1% in umbilical circulation. Generally, lorazepam was a useful anxiolytic agent during normal delivery and as a sedative on the night before caesarean section.", 
    "24": "1 Laboratory tests of psychomotor performance and 'on road' assessments of car handling ability were made following repeated doses of clobazam 10 mg three times daily, lorazepam 1 mg three times daily and matching placebo 1 capsule three times daily. 2 Both active compounds produced on impairment, compared to placebo, in some mental arithmetic and letter cancellation tasks, but these effects were neither widespread nor consistent. 3 Lorazepam produced a significant impairment of car driving tasks and analogue rating scales of subjective alertness. The pronounced sedative activity of the drug was also shown in the verbal reports of side effects and in indices of early morning sedation derived from the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. 4 Clobazam did not produce either the objective, or the subjective impairment of performance and alertness found with lorazepam. 5 The results taken as a whole show important differences between the 1,4 benzodiazepine, lorazepam, and the 1,5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, in their effects on the integrity of psychomotor performance related to car driving ability.", 
    "25": "Local reactions after i.v. injection of diazepam, flunitrazepam and isotonic saline were studied in patients who received extradural analgesia or general anaesthesia. The frequency of thrombophlebitis on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days after the injection of diazepam was 2.1%, 17.0% and 14.9% respectively, after flunitrazepam 10.0%. 10.0% and 14.0%, and after saline 0%, 6.7% and 4.4%. The differences between the groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). One month after the injection 15.6% in the diazepam group, 8.5% in the flunitrazepam group and 9.3% in the saline group had pain or tenderness in the arm used for the injection.", 
    "26": "Temazepam 20 mg orally was compared with titrated doses of i.v. diazepam as sedation for elective upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy. The mean time from taking oral temazepam to endoscopy was 66 min, and from i.v. diazepam to endoscopy was 10 min. The endoscopists found that the sedation achieved was the same in both groups and allowed adequate examination of the upper alimentary tract. The oral presentation, avoiding the pain of injection and the possible shorter duration of action, made oral temazepam preferable to i.v. diazepam.", 
    "27": "The influence of intravenous Flunitrazepam (0.4-0.8 mg), Benzoctamine (10-20 mg) and Placebo (NaCl 0.9%) on pO2, pCO2, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume and peak flow were investigated in patients with reduced lung function undergoing orthopaedic surgery under spinal anaesthesia. Both drugs depress respiration: Flunitrazepam immediately, Benzoctamine about 15 min after administration. Both drugs reduce lung function in the postoperative period. They should be administered under careful observation of patients' respiration, administration of oxygen and only in special cases where sedation is necessary to reduce psychological stress. The advantage of regional anaesthesia in patients with high risk of postoperative pulmonary failure seems worth retaining compared to general anaesthesia.", 
    "28": "Factors influencing the intravenous dose of diazepam required by 100 consecutive outpatients being prepared for peroral endoscopy were evaluated. Eleven patients reported a history of using 2 or more doses of benzodiazepine a week and required 0.48 +/- 0.1 mg/kg of diazepam compared with 0.30 +/- 0.02 mg/kg (P < 0.01) needed by 89 patients who reported less frequent or no use. The log (dose/kg) was negatively correlated with age (r = 0.51, P < 0.01), and the log dose was positively correlated with weight to a lesser degree (r = 0. 31, P < 0.01). In the larger group of patients who reported less than twice-weekly or no benzodiazepine use, no effect of alcohol use on dose was found. The dose was unrelated to sex. The findings emphasize the importance of individualizing intravenous doses of diazepam.", 
    "29": "A simple system is described to analyze the possibility that increased exploratory behavior is an index for the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines in laboratory rodents. Mice were allowed free run in a two-chambered arena, where two-thirds of the area was illuminated and one-third was darkened. The two chambers were separated by a black partition equipped with photocells across the opening, and the entire cage rested on an Animex activity monitor. Transitions across the partition between the light and dark chambers, and total Animex locomotor activity, were increased by clonazepam and chlordiazepoxide, in dose-dependent ranges consistent with previously reported behavior models. The increased exploratory activity with benzodiazepines does not appear to be a non-specific increase in general motor activity, as locomotion in clonazepam and chlordiazepoxide treated mice placed in a bare, undifferentiated cage was not significantly different from vehicle treated mice.", 
    "30": "The synthesis and biological evaluation of some derivatives of pyrazino[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepines for anxiolytic and antidepressant activity are presented. Significant levels of anxiolytic activity were noted for 7-(o-chlorophenyl)-9-chloro-1,2,3,4,4a,5-hexahydro-3-methylpyrazino[1,2-a];E11,4]benzodiazepine (4b).", 
    "31": "The synthesis of 10-piperazinyl-4H-thieno[3,2-b][1,5]benzodiazepines is described. The activity of these compounds has been assessed on the basis of their ability to produce hypothermia in mice and block a conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and produce catalepsy in rats, and the results are compared with various classical and nonclassical neuroleptic drugs. A number of compounds (6, 17, 21, and 22) demonstrate potency greater than clozapine and also show low degree of catalepsy. It is believed that this profile of activity, unlike standard neuroleptics, is associated with the relative lack of extrapyramidal side effects in the clinic. The corresponding 9-piperazinyl-4H-thieno[1,4]benzodiazepines (12 and 35, limited analogues prepared in the respective series, were inactive.", 
    "32": "A series of 4-substituted 10H-theino[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepines has been synthesized. These compounds have been assessed for their ability to block a conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and to produce catalepsy in rats and have been compared with several typical and atypical neuroleptics. The compounds which inhibit CAR at doses which produce no catalepsy are believed to cause less extrapyramidal side effects in the clinic. A number of compounds (9, 12, 17, 29, and 34) show potent neuroleptic activity, yet maintain a favorable separation of activity on these two parametrs. Three 5-piperazinyl-10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine derivatives (46-48) analogous to compounds in the [1,5] series have been prepared for comparison and were found to be inactive.", 
    "33": "A series of 6-(substituted-amino)-4H-s-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines was prepared for pharmacological evaluation, and, because of an interesting chemical isomerization, a similar series of 4-(substituted-amino)-6H-s-triazolo[4,3-alpha][1,4]benzodiazepines was also obtained. Pharmacological evaluation of these compounds demonstrated that8-choloro-1-methyl-6-piperidino-4H-s-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazpin e (10) had interesting activity in tests useful for detecting antianxiety activity, while the corresponding 4-piperidino derivative (15) had little activity in these tests. A brief discussion of a possible mechanism for the isomerization is also included.", 
    "34": "Caerulein and the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8), after subcutaneous administration to mice, both delayed the onset and retarded the development of toxic effects of convulsants such as strychnine, pentetrazol, bicuculline, and picrotoxin. They also increased the seizure threshold doses of intravenously infused pentetrazol and picrotoxin. In this regard, both peptides were at least equipotent with diazepam.", 
    "35": "In a double-blind study, 100 young, healthy (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1) patients received lorazepam (Ativan; Wyeth) 2,5 mg or placebo orally as premedication before general anaesthesia for extraction of wisdom teeth. Lorazepam produced a significant reduction in the incidence of pre-operative anxiety and post-anaesthetic headache compared with placebo (P less than 0,01). Anterograde amnesia was also more frequent in the patients who had received lorazepam (P less than 0.001). The medicolegal implications of using lorazepam as a premedicant in dental surgery at a day clinic are discussed.", 
    "36": "Benzodiazepines exhibit reversible, stereospecific high affinity binding to mammalian brain membranes, and the respective binding sites for 3H-flunitrazepam represent pharmacologically and clinically relevant receptors for benzodiazepines. Recently it has been demonstrated that reversibly bound 3H-flunitrazepam becomes irreversibly attached to a specific membrane protein with apparent molecular weight of 50,000 when incubations are performed in the presence of UV light. Irreversible binding of 3H-flunitrazepam to this protein had pharmacological properties similar to reversible benzodiazepine receptor binding, indicating that 3H-flunitrazepam is a photoaffinity label for the benzodiazepine receptor. Using irreversible binding of 3H-flunitrazepam and subsequent electrophoretic separation of the labelled proteins in SDS-gels followed by fluorography, we found that in hippocampus and several other brain regions at least two different types of benzodiazepine receptors exist. Each seems to be associated with a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor.", 
    "37": "This autoradiographic study revealed after an i.,v. injection an accumulation of 3H-flunitrazepam in melanin granules of the pigment epithelium and of the choroid cells. It seems that after a short period, a large proportion of the strongly bound drug is released.", 
    "38": "The binding of [3H]-alpha-dihydropicrotoxinin (DHP) to rat brain membranes was inhibited by aqueous extracts of the same tissue, as well as by several naturally occurring substances such as pyrimidines, purines, and their metabolites. The 200 000 X g supernatant fraction of cortex homogenates inhibited DHP binding competitively, reversibly, without preincubation, at 0 degrees C, with 40 microgram protein inhibiting 50%. Compounds such as adenine, hypoxanthine, inosine, cytosine, allantoin and uric acid at about 0.1 mM also inhibited DHP binding competitively, suggesting a relationship between DHP binding sites, benzodiazepine binding sites, and GABA receptor binding sites.", 
    "39": "Monkeys were exposed to varying doses of soman and given therapy. Therapy consisted of pyridostigmine, clonazepam, atropine and HS-6 or HI-6. Cerebral electrical activity, heart rate, respiration, systemic blood pressure and cholinesterase activity were recorded thoughtout the experiment. The animals in the HS-6 series were divided into 4 groups depending upon the dose of soman; one group received 30 microgram/kg of soman, the second group received 40 microgran/kg. All animals in the HI06 series survived while only one of three monkeys in the fourth group survived. Administration of therapy immediately suppressed all seizure activity and convulsions and the animals appeared awake throughout the experiment. All animals exhibited bradycardia and hypotension following the adminstration of therapy. The cholinesterase activity was depressed after administration of HS-6 therapy. Three of the four monkey that received therapy consisting of HI-6 at a dose of 15 mg/kg survived, while one of two that received HI-6 at a dose of 30 mg/kg survived. The animals that received HI-6 at a dose of 15 mg/kg did not exhibit as severe a decrease in blood pressure as the animals in either the HS-6 series or the monkeys that received HI-6 at 30 mg/kg. In addition, these monkeys were awake and appeared alert throughout the experiment and were up within 4-6 hr post-exposure to soman. The animals that received 30 mg/kg exhibited severe hypotension and did poorly.", 
    "40": "Many women suffer a constellation of urinary and pelvic symptoms commonly referred to as the urethral syndrome. Numerous medical, surgical and psychological treatment modalities have been used to alleviate the symptoms. Urodynamic techniques were used to study a group of women with the urethral syndrome. Based on the findings of external urethral sphincter spasm and/or pelvic floor hyperactivity the institution of diazepam therapy not only has provided clinical relief but also sphincter synergy as demonstrated by post-treaatment urodynamics.", 
    "41": "Drug oxidations are catalyzed by the liver microsomal fraction of human fetuses but not by fetal livers from most experimental animals. In contrast, glucuronidation of some substrates is catalyzed by the rat fetal liver in late gestation but not in the human fetal liver. The deficient human fetal glucuronidation seems to be compensated for by early development of sulfation activity. The inconsistency of the results from animal fetuses and human fetuses shows that animal data have little relevance for the human fetus. No generalized statements can be made about drug disposition in the newborn infant as compared to adults. Although most drugs that are oxidized have prolonged plasma half-lives in the neonatal period there are examples of drugs with half-lives similar to, or even shorter than, the average half-lives in adults. Oxazepam is conjugated with glucuronic acid in adults. The neonatal plasma half-life of this drug is considerably prolonged. This is true also for its conjugate as would be expected from the immature renal function in newborns. Adequate pharmacokinetic information is a prerequisite for rational and safe drug treatment in the neonatal period.", 
    "42": "1 Brotizolam, a triazolo-1,4-thienodiazepine, was studied in healthy young adults. Electroencephalographic sleep variables and subjective effects, and performance on a visuo-motor coordination task were measured. 2 In the sleep studies six males each ingested 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg brotizolam overnight. All doses increased total sleep time, improved the sleep efficiency index, and reduced drowsy sleep and number of awakenings. Brotizolam 0.4 and 0.6 mg also reduced awake activity and increased stage 2 sleep. There was some evidence of a delay to the first REM period, but only 0.6 mg reduced the total duration of REM sleep. There were no changes in slow wave sleep. 3. In the performance studies six females each ingested 0.4 mg in the morning and 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg brotizolam at night. After morning ingestion of 0.4 mg there was impaired performance from 0.5 to 5.5 h. There were no residual effects after 0.2 mg brotizolam, but with 0.4 mg there was a residual effect at 9.5 h, and 0.6 mg led to impairments up to 15.0 h after ingestion. 4 Brotizolam is a short-acting hypnotic. In doses around 0.2 mg it has useful hypnotic activity free of adverse effects on sleep and residual effects on performance. With 0.4 mg the hypnotic effect is enhanced with only minimal residual effects.", 
    "43": "The selectivity and sensitivity provided by a wall-coated open tubular column coupled with a nitrogen-selective detector allowed rapid, accurate determination of diazepam, meprobamate, phenylbutazone, and thioridazine in serum in the same chromatographic system using 100--200 microliters of sample.", 
    "44": "An 18 year old boy suffering from episodic sleep disorders triggered by fever was studied in the sleep laboratory. An episode was recorded, starting in slow wave sleep. The diurnal sleep record showed the presence of benign epileptiform transients of sleep. The treatment with diazepam was successful. The relationships with disorders of arousal and epilepsy are discussed.", 
    "45": "Rabbits treated with therapeutical dosages of five widely prescribed drug (indomethacin, isoniazid, lorazepam, tolbutamide, clofibrate) show ultrastructural changes within live cells which are inhibited by concomitant administration of silymarin.", 
    "46": "The chromosome aberration rate was studied in bone marrow cells of C57BL/6, CBA and BALB/c mice before and after emotional stress. After \"the opened field\" experiment the chromosome aberration rate in C57BL/6 and CBA mice increased while that in BALB/c mice remained unchanaed. The mutagenic effect was prevented by phenazepam.", 
    "47": "Pigs were trained to press a panel with their snout to get food in an operant conditioning chamber. Aggressive behaviour which developed between two pigs submitted together to extinction was used as a baseline to study the effects of 1-2 mg/kg diazepam. When access to the response panel and feeding area was permitted, diazepam enhanced resistance to extinction and did not modify aggression. When access to the response panel and feeding area was not permitted, diazepam increased the severity of aggression observed between the animals. In both instances, plasma corticosteroid levels were depressed in diazepam-treated pigs. These results suggest that benzodiazepines do not act on frustation or aggressiveness per se, but rather strengthen the prevailing behavioural attitudes in the animals' repertoire at the time of test.", 
    "48": "A series of noval peptidoaminobenzophenones has been prepared via several routes and was evaluated for CNS activity. The structure--activity relationships in the series are discussed. In general, dipeptido-N-methylaminobenzophenones showed higher activities than the corresponding NH derivatives. Some compounds had very high activities in antipentylenetetrazole and antifighting tests in mice when orally administered. Very weak toxicity was also found in these compounds. Water solubility of the peptidoaminobenzophenones and their salts were tested. Possible in these compounds. Water solubility of the peptidoaminobenzophenones and their salts were tested. Possible in vivo conversion of peptidoaminobenzophenone by enzymatic cleavage of the terminal amino acid, followed by chemical cyclization to 1,4-benzodiazepine, is also discussed. Such novel open-ring derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepine may serve as useful CNS agents.", 
    "49": "Electromyographic (EMG) recordings from multiple muscle groups with surface electrodes during systematic evaluation of phasic and tonic stretch reflexes, cutaneomuscular reflexes, long loop reflexes, postural reflexes, and volitional activation have been used to provide a neurophysiologic basis for selection of the appropriate treatment for spasticity, and to gain further insights into the general mechanisms of spasticity. Pharmacologic methods are useful as a temporary measure. Hypertonia of a single muscle can be effectively treated with 40% alcohol injections to the motor points and hypertonia of a muscle group with partial denervation through 6% phenol in water injected into the nerve trunk. Hypertonia of several muscle groups can be treated by chemical or surgical rhizotomy or myelotomy. Generalized hypertonia involving limb and trunk muscles can be modified through chronic epidural stimulation of the spinal cord. Modification of reciprocal antagonistic muscle activity may be achieved through electrical stimulation of the involved nerve trunks.", 
    "50": "Alprazolam was compared to diazepam and placebo in 235 outpatients suffering from manifest anxiety. In this 28-day double-blind study, alprazolam was more effective than placebo and essentially equivalent to diazepam in alleviating the symptoms of anxiety. However, alprazolam produced a markedly lower incidence of side effects than either diazepam or placebo. Of particular note, drowsiness was reported less than half as frequently by alprazolam patients than by diazepam patients. These results were achieved with an average daily dose of 1.5 mg alprazolam compared to 18.6 mg diazepam.", 
    "51": "It has been shown that depakin, a GABA-ergic agonist, and alpha-methyl-DOPA that inhibits catecholamine synthesis are capable of removing the withdrawal syndrome (disturbed pavlovian behavior pattern and aggressiveness) occurring after discontinuance of long-term administration (30 days) of phenazepam to rats in a dose of 2 mg/kg. In contrast, bicucullin, a blocker of GABA-ergic receptors, thiosemicarbazide that inhibits GABA synthesis by the brain, disulfiram and 3,4-dioxyphenylalanine that increase dopamine and noradrenaline content in the barain aggravate the withdrawal syndrome after phenazepam is discontinued. The data obtained suggest a role of GABA-ergic and dopaminergic mechanisms in the emergence of the withdrawal syndrome after discontinuance of long-term administration of benzdiazepins.", 
    "52": "The effects of two new cannabinoids, nabilone and canbisol, have been compared to delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) and chlordiazepoxide in behavioral tests in mice, rats, dogs and rhesus monkeys. Activity of mice was measured in a photocell device. Oral doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg of delta 9-THC and 200 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide caused only a decrease in the initial high activity. Doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg of nabilone and 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg of canbisol decreased the initial high activity but increased the subsequent low activity. In rats delta 9-THC, nabilone and canbisol, but not chlordiazepoxide, slowed muricide and intracranial self-stimulation. Chlordiazepoxide, nabilone and canbisol, but not delta 9-THC, reduced reactivity of septal-lesioned rats. At ehe dosages studied only nabilone and canbisol reduced food consumption by rats. Ataxia in dogs was detected following as little as 0.062 mg/kg of delta 9-THC, 0.032 mg/kg of nabilone and 0.004 mg/kg of canbisol when given intravenously; orally, doses of more than 0.25 mg/kg of delta 9-THC, and 0.1 mg/kg of nabilone or canbisol were necessary. Rhesus monkeys working under multiple fixed-ratio fixed-interval schedules showed an increase in rate at some dose of all three cannabinoids but higher doses reduced responding, and responding was abolished following 3.0 mg/kg of delta 9-THC or nabilone or 0.3 mg/kg of canbisol. Chlordiazepoxide increased responding at all doses studied, 3.0 to 30.0 mg/kg. Nabilone and canbisol resemble chlordiazepoxide in som tests and delta 9-THC in other tests."
