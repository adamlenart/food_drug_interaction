    "0": "The effect of 3 dosages of bromazepam administered as single oral doses (1.5, 3 and 6 mg) on anxious inhibition phenomena was studied in a population of 16 young women (18-30 years) with anxiety-traits, selected on the criteria of Cattell's anxiety scale supported by two personality inventory (Eysenck's, MMPI). A double-blind, placebo study design was chosen. The main assessment criteria were based on the go/no-go test (Logan's procedure), slow response rate (SRR) and a task of forced or unforced decision (use of the CFF). Attentional processes and declarative memory were analyzed as secondary criteria. None of the three dosages modified inhibition or acting-out. Sustained attention was reduced with 1.5 mg and 6 mg, as was memory performance with 3 and 6 mg, 3.5 h after drug administration. In contradistinction with studies carried out in healthy volunteers or with other benzodiazepine compounds, bromazepam at single low dosages does not modify inhibition capacity in these subjects with traits of anxiety, in this particular procedure.", 
    "1": "In a first experiment, four doses (ranging between 0.04 and 0.45 mg/kg of body weight) of the essential oil from Tagetes minuta L. were subcutaneously injected in two-day-old chicks and a dose-response curve assessed for escape performance in a T-maze test. The 0.1, 0.25 and 0.45 mg/kg doses impaired the first escape performance suggesting an anxiogenic-like effect of the essential oil. After 3 h the same chicks were tested for a second escape performance, without being injected again, and no differences were observed compared to controls, suggesting that the essential oil did not affect retention. Furthermore, the effects of the essential oil were observed in the three sections of the T-maze apparatus. So, the performance was impaired in the isolation chamber section, suggesting the induction of increased anxiogenic behaviour, and also in the mirror section, suggesting that the social reinstatement behaviour was modified by an increased anxiety level. Changes in the principal corridor section were not observed, suggesting that the locomotor activity was not affected by these oil doses. The second escape performance was not affected in any of the T-maze sections, confirming that these doses did not affect learning ability. In a second experiment, a middle dose of the essential oil (0.25 mg/kg) increased the tonic immobility reaction in 15 days old chicks similarly to an anxiogenic dose of FG 7142 (1 mg/kg), while an anxiolytic dose of diazepam (0.08 mg/kg) did not affect this behaviour. Taken together, the present results suggest that the essential oil from Tagetes minuta L. may exert a negative modulation on the GABAergic function without affecting the learning ability.", 
    "2": "Renal scintigraphy is one of the diagnostic devices in the upper urinary tract. In 24 dogs of different age, sex and breed that--according to the usual laboratory tests--were considered healthy with respect to renal function, a renal scintigraphy with the tubular excreted tracer 99mTc-MAG3 was performed. The dogs were grouped according to three different anaesthetic regimens in order to estimate the influence of anaesthesia--which is necessary for this investigation--onto function of the normal kidney. Eight dogs were scintigraphed twice using different anaesthesia protocols. In group A (n = 22), anaesthesia was performed with a combination of atropine/diazepam/ketamine/xylazine. The reference range determined was for the period of maximal activity accumulation (Tmax) 3.2 +/- 0.8 min and for the elimination half-time (Tmax/2) 6.3 +/- 1.4 min. MAG3-clearance was 7.5 +/- 1.8 ml/min/kg. Group B (n = 5) received thiopental as a continuous intravenous infusion. Tmax was measured with 2.9 +/- 1.1 min, Tmax/2 with 4.7 +/- 1.2 min and the MAG3-clearance was 6.8 +/- 1.6 ml/min/kg. In group C (n = 5), the dogs were given propofol and halothane, and the values determined for Tmax and Tmax/2 were 4.8 +/- 2.7 and 4.8 +/- 1.4 min, respectively. The MAG3-clearance was 10.0 +/- 2.3 ml/min/kg. It is concluded that the anaesthetic regime used has a distinct influence on the reference values.",

    "4": "Six patients with acquired lesions and 18 patients with normal high-resolution MRI and extratemporal partial seizures, as well as 24 normal controls, were studied with 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET to produce voxel-by-voxel images of FMZ volume of distribution (FMZVD), which reflects density of GABA(A)-cBZRs. These images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Each patient was compared with the control group to reveal regions with abnormal FMZVD at p < 0.001 uncorrected, corrected to p < 0.05 for the whole brain volume. Each normal control was compared with the remaining controls in the same manner.", 
    "5": "All six patients with acquired lesions had a single region of reduced FMZVD. Thirteen of 18 patients with normal MRI had regions of abnormal cortical FMZVD: 10 had regions of increased FMZVD, 6 had regions of decreased FMZVD, and 3 had both regions of increased and decreased FMZVD. Seven patients had an abnormality in the lobe and 12 in the hemisphere of presumed seizure origin.", 
    "6": "FMZ PET analyzed with SPM is an automated, objective, sensitive, and specific means for detecting regional cortical abnormalities of GABA(A)-cBZRs in patients with partial seizures. This technique may be useful in the evaluation of patients with refractory partial seizures for surgical treatment, particularly in those patients with normal MRI.", 
    "7": "The super high affinity binding sites for [3H]Ro15-4513, a partial inverse agonist of central benzodiazepine receptors, were analyzed in rat hippocampus both in vivo and in vitro. An ultra high sensitive method of autoradiography with an imaging plate system was employed for quantitative analysis of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding. In in vitro binding, the super high affinity binding sites in the hippocampus were observed when the [3H]Ro15-4513 concentration was below 0.5 nM. In vivo, the super high affinity binding sites were only found when the injected dose of Ro15-4513 was below 3.6 microg/kg and almost disappeared when the dose was increased to 10 microg/kg. These results both in vivo and in vitro indicate that there is a significant discrepancy between actual free ligand concentration in vivo and in vitro, and that concentrations in intact brain may be much lower than previously thought.",

    "9": "We studied 15 patients with angiographically-confirmed unilateral severe occlusive lesions (occlusion or > 70% stenosis) in the carotid system. IMZ SPECT images obtained 180 min after injection of 167-222 MBq IMZ were analyzed. The regional cerebral blood flow and perfusion reserve were evaluated for comparison with IMZ SPECT findings, using the split-dose 123I-iodoamphetamine (IMP) SPECT method, coupled with intravenous injection of 1 g acetazolamide. On both SPECT images, the count ratio of the affected to the nonaffected whole MCA territory (A/NA ratio) and of the contralateral to the ipsilateral cerebellar cortex (C/I ratio) were determined.", 
    "10": "The A/NA ratio with IMZ was significantly higher than that with IMP (94.5% +/- 6.2% versus 91.4% +/- 6.6%, p < 0.005), although a significantly positive correlation was found between these two ratios (r = 0.854, p < 0.0001). The C/I ratio with IMP was decreased significantly in 5 patients compared with that in normal subjects, whereas the C/I ratio with IMZ was decreased in only 1 patient. There was no significant correlation between the A/NA ratio with IMZ and the perfusion reserve in the affected MCA territory. In 2 of 5 patients with a decreased A/NA ratio (<90%) with IMZ, decreased blood flow with preserved perfusion reserve and cerebral hemispheric atrophy were observed, which suggested the influence of neuronal loss due to chronic ischemia.", 
    "11": "These findings indicate that IMZ SPECT, which provides new information regarding neuronal damage after ischemic insult to the brain, is useful for evaluating thrombotic cerebral ischemia.", 
    "12": "Ketamine is still a relatively seldom-used anaesthetic because of its psychotomimetic and sympathomimetic side-effects and because ketamine anaesthesia is poorly controllable. At present, the enantiomer S-(+)-ketamine (Ketanest S) is clinically used. During its application, a twofold higher pharmacologic potency and a faster elimination can be expected than with the racemic-ketamine mixture. Particularly in paediatric anaesthesia, no practical experience could be gained with this new drug. Form the current standpoint, an overview is given of the possible applications of ketamine in children regarding premedication and early induction of ketamine anaesthesia in combination with midazolam because ketamine can be inserted through the nose or rectum and it can also be applied orally or intramuscularly. Ketamine widens the anaesthetist's possibilities of premedication considerably and thus a calm induction of anaesthesia with stabilized spontaneous ventilation becomes possible in children with difficult conditions for venous puncturing, in very anxious children and in those who are not able to accept the necessity of treatment. The use of ketamine for the performance of small operations, for analgosedation during diagnostic procedures, for induction of anaesthesia in children with unstable haemodynamic conditions and with cardiac defects connected with reduced lung perfusion and for analgosedation in intensive care, in particular in patients with obstructive ventilation disturbances and diseases which need a therapy with catecholamines, is discussed. To avoid complications, the children should be supervised constantly during the application of ketamine. It should be used only in low doses and any combination with centrally depressive-acting drugs--with the exception of midazolam--should be avoided. During analgosedation with ketamine and midazolam in intensive care, the anaesthetist must be aware of a cumulative effect in particular in those children with liver and kidney insufficiencies. Analgosedation with ketamine and propofol can be better controlled horizontally and therefore, this combination should be taken more into consideration in children with the exception of those with diseases of inflammatory and septic genesis.", 
    "13": "The administration of drugs by subcutaneous infusion is routinely practiced in palliative medicine for the management of patients who are no longer able to take oral medication. It is not uncommon for two or more drugs to be combined in subcutaneous infusion solutions. The combination of an opioid and a short-acting benzodiazepine is frequently required. Unfortunately, the stability of benzodiazepines and newer opioids, such as fentanyl, has not been determined. This study examined the stability of solutions containing either fentanyl alone or fentanyl and midazolam in combination. Eight different solutions were assessed for up to 7 days following preparation. The solutions were prepared in polypropylene syringes using 0.9% saline as a diluent. Duplicate syringes were stored at approximately 5 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 38 degrees C. High performance liquid chromatography was the analytical technique used to measure fentanyl and midazolam. Initial concentrations ranges were 13.2-38.9 micrograms/mL for fentanyl and 282-959 micrograms/mL for midazolam. It was found that fentanyl (+/- midazolam) was very stable (> 95%) when stored at temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C to 38 degrees C for at least 1 week. Midazolam (+ fentanyl) was not as stable as fentanyl under the same storage conditions and underwent time-dependent decomposition of up to 12.1% (observed at 7 days when stored at 38 degrees C). When stored at 22 degrees C and 38 degrees C, more than 90% of initial midazolam concentrations were retained for 4 days following preparation and for 7 days when stored at 5 degrees C. The clinical implications of these results are that, on the basis of physicochemical stability, subcutaneous infusion solutions containing fentanyl and midazolam may be prepared at intervals of 4 days (or 7 days if stored under refrigerated conditions).", 
    "14": "Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the measurement of benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) receptor kinetics. We employed flumazenil radiolabeled with carbon 11, a radioligand that labels the benzodiazepine site on the GABA(A) receptor, and fully quantitative, high-sensitivity PET to test the hypothesis that central benzodiazepine site binding is decreased in medication-free patients with panic disorder.", 
    "15": "We compared 7 patients with panic disorder who had been off medication for at least 6 months and who had never abused alcohol with 8 healthy controls. The resulting parametric voxel-by-voxel maps were analyzed by voxel-based and region of interest-based methods using both parametric and nonparametric statistics.", 
    "16": "The major finding was that there is a global reduction in benzodiazepine site binding throughout the brain in patients with panic disorder compared with controls. There were sex differences in the 2 samples, but a separate analysis excluding women led to the same conclusions. In addition, the loci with the largest regional decrease in binding (right orbitofrontal cortex and right insula) were areas thought to be essential in the central mediation of anxiety.", 
    "17": "These results must be considered preliminary but are congruous with previous clinical psychopharmacologic evidence of involvement of the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor and demonstrate that decreased flumazenil binding at this site may underlie panic disorder.",

    "22": "The consensus statement provides standard definitions for response and remission and identifies appropriate strategy for the management of panic disorder in a primary care setting. Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are recommended as drugs of first choice with a treatment period of 12 to 24 months. Pharmacotherapy should be discontinued slowly over a period of 4 to 6 months.", 
    "23": "This article reviews the incidences of side effects in placebo-controlled clinical trials of drug therapy in patients with panic disorder. We performed a MEDLINE search for placebo-controlled studies in panic disorder that reported the incidences of side effects, published in English language, peer-reviewed journals between 1992 and 1997. We discuss the side effects experienced by patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, and benzodiazepines, the drug classes most commonly prescribed for the treatment of panic disorder. Available evidence suggests that, with respect to tolerability, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are the most favorable treatment choice for patients with panic disorder.", 
    "24": "Antidepressants and high-potency benzodiazepines have been used to treat patients with panic disorder. This review considers the efficacy of these treatments in reducing panic attack frequency and in addition considers their ability to attenuate global anxiety, depressive symptomatology, agoraphobic avoidance, and overall impairment. An extensive database is available for the tricyclic antidepressants imipramine and clomipramine, the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, and the benzodiazepine alprazolam. The antidepressants are more effective than the benzodiazepines in reducing associated depressive symptomatology and are at least as effective for improving anxiety, agoraphobia, and overall impairment.",

This paper reviews data from long-term studies of drug treatment for panic disorder to address issues of whether medication benefits persist, whether improvement can continue over several months or years, the tolerability of long-term treatment, patient selection for long-term treatment, and when and how to stop medication. The main conclusion is that long-term drug treatment of panic disorder is necessary, effective, and safe. Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors offer benefits of ease of dosing, good tolerability, and no safety or dependence problems; TCAs are often poorly tolerated, and benzodiazepines are associated with dependence problems. Withdrawal from all types of medication should be considered, slow, planned, and individualized; some patients require an indefinite duration of treatment.", 
    "26": "The effects of chronic diazepam treatment (10 mg/kg/day for 180 days) on the fractional distribution and fatty acid composition of heart phospholipids were studied in male Wistar rats. It was found that diazepam treatment increased the content of phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin in the heart and slightly increased its phosphatidylcholine fraction. There were no significant changes in fatty acid composition after diazepam treatment in heart phospholipids, with the exception of significant decrease of 20:3n-6 and 20:5n-3 fatty acids. Our findings suggest that diazepam, probably through peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, altered the content of heart cardiolipin and caused changes in the flux of oxidative phosphorylation in the heart.", 
    "27": "In this controlled study, we compared clonidine with conventional premedication in 35 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After premedication with clonidine 5 microg/kg p.o. (Group C, n = 11), lorazepam 60 microg/kg p.o. (Group L, n = 13), or morphine 0.1 mg/kg plus scopolamine 6 microg/kg i.m. (Group M, n = 11), sedation, anxiety, and quality of premedication were graded. After the administration of sufentanil 2.0 microg/kg over 12.5 min, a computer-assisted infusion device targeted a sufentanil effect-site concentration of 0.75 ng/mL. Hemodynamic variables, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (ET-ISO), the electroencephalographic spectral edge, and the serum sufentanil concentration (SUF) were measured. There were no intergroup differences in anxiety, sedation, quality of premedication, the dose of sufentanil causing unconsciousness, or the electroencephalographic (EEG) response to induction. Intraoperative SUF was stable, with no intergroup difference. The average prebypass ET-ISO was lower in Group C than in Group M. The ET-ISO and peak ET-ISO after intense surgical stimulation were lower in Group C versus Groups L and M. Mean arterial blood pressure was lower in Group C versus Groups L and M. There were no intergroup differences in pharmacologic intervention, time to extubation, or intensive care unit stay. Clonidine produces sedation, anxiolysis, and quality of premedication comparable to conventional premedication. Compared with other drugs, clonidine does not alter the dose of sufentanil inducing unconsciousness or EEG slowing, but it uniquely reduces isoflurane requirements.",

Clonidine does not uniquely alter the dose of sufentanil inducing unconsciousness or electroencephalographic slowing, but it significantly reduces isoflurane requirements.", 
    "29": "We conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare quality of sedation, hemodynamic stability, and oxygen consumption of three different drugs for continuous i.v. sedation in the immediate postoperative period in patients scheduled for aortic surgery (propofol [n = 12], sufentanil [n = 12], or midazolam [n = 12]). After arrival in the recovery room, patients were randomized into one of the following groups: Group P (continuous infusion of propofol 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), Group S (continuous infusion of sufentanil 0.25 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1), with bolus doses of midazolam 2 mg to maintain sedation at 3-4 on the Ramsay scale), and Group M (continuous infusion of midazolam 0.07-0.15 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) to maintain sedation at 3-4 on the Ramsay scale). The three drugs were associated with similar hemodynamic stability, incidence of myocardial ischemia, and comparable kinetics and mean values for VO2, but a significant higher number of peaks for VO2 in Group S during the period of rewarming. To obtain an appropriate Ramsay score, we needed to increase the rate of administration of the drug in Group P, and to decrease this rate in Group M. After the drugs were discontinued, Group P required mechanical ventilation for less time. In conclusion, propofol is as effective as sufentanil or midazolam in controlling increased VO2 postoperatively. The initial dose of 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) had to be increased for most patients. In addition, propofol sedation is associated with a quicker recovery compared with midazolam and sufentanil.", 
    "30": "A prospective, randomized comparison of propofol, sufentanil and midazolam infusions revealed similar effects on hemodynamics, oxygen consumption, and rate of myocardial ischemia after aortic surgery, although propofol was associated with a quicker recovery compared with midazolam and sufentanil.",

    "37": "We have recently demonstrated that the endozepine octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) exerts an inhibitory influence on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA expression. The effect is mediated by GABAA receptors and is reversed by adrenalectomy. In order to investigate the involvement of peripheral steroids and more particularly of glucocorticoids in the ODN modulation of CRH mRNA expression, we have evaluated, in adrenalectomized and castrated male rats (ADX/CX), the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) pretreatment on CRH mRNA expression induced by central injection of ODN. Variations in the CRH mRNA expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus have been studied using quantitative in situ hybridization. The intracerebroventricular injection of ODN (4 microg/kg), as previously reported, induced a significant inhibition of CRH mRNA expression in sham-operated rats (-33%). This inhibition was reversed in ADX/CX male rats (+65% vs. sham vehicle-injected rats and +20% vs. ADX/CX vehicle-injected rats). Pretreatment with DEX (5 mg/kg) during 4 days induced in ADX/CX rats a decrease of 22% (vs. ADX/CX vehicle-injected rats) in the CRH mRNA signal, which became comparable to that observed in sham vehicle-injected rats. Pretreatment of ADX/CX animals with DEX prevented the ODN-induced increase in CRH mRNA expression, inducing rather a 16 and 30% inhibition when compared to vehicle- and ODN-injected ADX/CX rats, respectively. Moreover the CRH mRNA levels observed in ODN-injected ADC/CX rats were higher than those observed in sham vehicle- and sham ODN-injected rats (+16% vs. sham vehicle-injected rats and +63% vs. sham ODN-injected rats). These results indicate that dexamethasone treatment in ADX/CX rats can restore mRNA levels to those observed in sham-operated animals but not the inhibiting effect induced by ODN. Together with previous findings, these results suggest that adrenal and/or gonadal factor(s) other than glucocorticoids are involved in ODN modulation of the HPA axis.", 
    "38": "The present study evaluated in mice the central inhibitory effects of a water extract of shichangpu (Acori graminei rhizoma (AGR), the dry rhizome of Acorus gramineus Soland. (Araceae)). AGR (0.5-5.0 g/kg) dose-dependently decreased the locomotor activity and increased the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, but had no significant effect on the treadmill performance. AGR also dose-dependently inhibited the intensity of apomorphine-induced stereotypic behavior. At the highest dose (5.0 g/kg), AGR had a weak anticonvulsant effect on the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Receptor binding assays showed that AGR competed with [3H]SCH-23390 and [3H]YM-09151-2 for specific binding to striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with Ki values of 5.6 and 4.2 mg/ml, respectively. AGR also competed with [3H]muscimol for specific binding to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding site of cortex GABA(A) receptors with a Ki value of 0.31 mg/ml. It also increased the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptors, suggesting a GABA agonist-like action. These results suggested that the central inhibitory effects of AGR were probably effected through an action on the central dopamine receptors and GABA(A) receptors. The principle of AGR acting at these ligand binding sites was not alpha-asarone, one of the important principles of AGR, since that alpha-asarone (10(-6)-10(-4) M) had no significant interactions with these binding sites.", 
    "39": "Carbamazepine and valproate have utility in the acute and prophylactic treatment of mood disorders that appears comparable with that of lithium, but there are emerging differences as well, including responsiveness in some lithium-nonresponsive illness subtypes. Carbamazepine and valproate are generally well tolerated, but each has its own adverse effect profile and proclivity for pharmacokinetic interactions. The high potency (anticonvulsant) benzodiazepines have utility in mood disorders as adjuncts to mood stabilizers and often can obviate the need for neuroleptics. Several small studies suggest that the dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blockers can be useful mood stabilizers, and several new antiepileptic agents, especially lamotrigine and gabapentin, may have mood-stabilizing properties. The actions of electroconvulsive therapy as they relate to activation of endogenous anticonvulsant processes, and the potential therapeutic effects of nonconvulsive repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation of brain, are promising areas of mood disorder research.", 
    "40": "Cibasone degradation products were measured in corpses of 15 cats poisoned with cibasone in a dose of 750 mg/kg. Cibasone was assessed by semiquantitative method on Silufol UV-254 plates from the content of the main degradation product 3-methylamino-5-chloro-benzophenone (MCB) in parallel with label in the benzene system. MCB was detectable in cadaveric material and in the container bottom panel for up to 7 years 8 months and in soft tissue until their complete putrefactive destruction. MCB concentrations were the highest in the stomach, thin intestine, and liver and the lowest in the muscles and bones. The main product of elenium (chlozepide) degradation product 2-amino-chloro-benzophenone (ACB) was detected along with MCB in a year and up to 4 years 7 months after burial, although elenium was not injected. Degradation products were identified by electron spectroscopy in UV and visible bands of the spectrum: lambda max = 238 and 410 nm for MCB and 238 and 390 nm for ACB. ACB is the product of MCB degradation-dimethylation in putrefactive degradation of tissues. Ethanol extraction of degradation products detects MCB and ACB 7 years 8 months postmortem.", 
    "41": "A number of O-alkynyloximes of tropinone and N-methyl-4-piperidinone have been synthesized and evaluated for muscarinic activity. The affinities of these oximes were tested in homogenates of cerebral cortex, heart, and submandibulary glands from rats using [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]-N-methylscopolamine as radioligands. The oximes bind to the cortical muscarinic receptors with pKi values varying from 3 to 7. Higher binding affinities were observed for the O-alkynyl tropinone oximes than the corresponding piperidinone analogues. Binding to the muscarinic sites in the heart and submandibulary glands was also observed but with lower affinities. Good M1 subtype selectivity (10-fold or greater) was observed with some oximes (26a, 28a, 32a) at the cortical sites. These oximes also attenuated scopolamine-induced impairment of the water mask task in mice. Functional assays for M3 activity on the rat aorta showed that all oximes possessed M3 agonist action but M2 agonist activity was not observed at the endothelium-denuded rabbit aorta. Analysis of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) indicated that the Connolly surface area is an important determinant of activity, accounting for 70% of the variation in cortical binding affinity among the oximes.", 
    "42": "A method to analyze in vivo metabolites in blood obtained from the hepatic vein after the intraportal injection of a drug was established. This method includes cannulation into the portal vein, hepatic vein and bile duct, followed by TLC-autoradioluminography of a non-extracted sample. Either [14C]diazepam, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenyL[3-(14)C]alanine or [14C]inulin was administered on the day following the surgical operation to avoid the influence of anesthesia. Radioactive concentrations of [14C]DOPA decreased rapidly in the first 1 min, then decreased gradually. The concentrations of [14C]diazepam increased within the first 1 min and then decreased gradually. The concentration of [14C]inulin was approximately 10 times higher than that of [14C]DOPA, and both decreased gradually. These results show that the uptake levels of the drugs to the liver varied depending on the drugs. The metabolites of [14C]diazepam and [14C]DOPA were detected as early as 5 s after administration. These results suggest that the in vivo hepatic first pass effect of drugs in the early period of injection (5 s) can be studied using these techniques.",

In the general anesthesia group, the oxygen pulse oximetry level declined to less than 95% in only one child; but in the sedation group, it declined to less than 95% in 16 patients (5.5% vs. 89%). Nine patients had a profound desaturation in sedation group (oxygen pulse oximetry < 90%); no patients in the general anesthesia group had desaturation (50% vs. 0%). In the general anesthesia group, heart rate and mean arterial pressure remained stable during the whole procedure, whereas in the sedation group, heart rate and mean arterial pressure increased significantly during the procedure.

    "47": "The problem of dependence on benzodiazepines has been aggravated by iatrogenic physiologic dependence on these medications and by polysubstance abusing patients using them in addition to other agents. A safe, rapid, and effective way to detoxify patients from benzodiazepines is of prime importance to facilitate further treatment of their psychiatric or substance use disorder. Patients withdrawing from these agents may experience physiologic withdrawal, rebound, and recurrence. In this paper the authors review the typical syndrome associated with withdrawal from benzodiazepines and discuss treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal using carbamazepine and valproate.", 
    "48": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid(GABA) has been established as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABAA receptors are coupled to benzodiazepine receptors and barbiturate binding site. They are ligand-gated Cl- channels that consist of a heteromeric mixture of protein subunits forming a pentameric structure. On the other hand, GABAC receptors appear to be relatively simple ligand-gated Cl- channels with a distinctive pharmacology, in that they are not blocked by bicuculline and not modulated by barbiturates, benzodiazepines or neuroactive steroids. Therefore, it is suggested that these multiple GABA receptors generate various inhibitory functions and the pharmacology of these novel subtypes of GABA receptors may yield important therapeutic agents.", 
    "49": "Midazolam is a commonly used benzodiazepine that is ideal for conscious sedation during a variety of procedures. Laryngospasm is listed by the manufacturer as a rare side effect of midazolam. Flumazenil is a competitive inhibitor of the benzodiazepines that is available for reversal at the end of such a procedure or when too much sedation has been achieved. We present a case of a 61-year-old man who was to undergo conscious sedation before cardioversion. Shortly after receiving midazolam, he developed laryngospasm and resultant respiratory distress; the laryngospasm was reversed by a small dose of flumazenil. The symptoms recurred after approximately 25 minutes and were again reversed with flumazenil. Neither midazolam-induced laryngospasm nor its reversal with flumazenil have previously been reported. A brief discussion regarding laryngospasm and the use of flumazenil are included.", 
    "50": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of L- and T-type Ca2+-channel blockade on myocardial contractility in guinea pig cardiomyocytes. Left ventricular myocardium from guinea pig contains both L- and T-type Ca2+ channels. The T-type Ca2+ influx was inhibited with mibefradil (1-100 microM), a novel compound with a threefold higher affinity for T- compared with L-type Ca2+ channels. In comparison, L-type Ca2+ influx was reduced by the benzodiazepine diltiazem (1-100 microM). The effect of mibefradil and diltiazem on electrically driven (0.5 Hz) isolated cardiomyocytes (n = 12) was studied in a concentration-dependent manner. The change of the contraction amplitude (percentage of cell shortening) was continuously recorded with an one-dimensional high-speed camera. Both mibefradil and diltiazem concentration-dependently reduced (p < 0.05 vs. control) the contraction amplitude in isolated myocytes from guinea pig. The concentration at which the contraction amplitude of guinea pig cardiomyocytes was reduced by 50% (EC50) was 31.6 microM for diltiazem and 6.3 microM for mibefradil, indicating that the T-type Ca2+-channel blocker mibefradil is more potent in reducing contractility in guinea pig cardiac myocytes in comparison with the L-type Ca2+-channel antagonist diltiazem. Mean values for cell shortening in percentage +/- SEM for mibefradil (0, 1, 10, 100 microM) were 100%, 78 +/- 9.2%, 36 +/- 5.4%, and 24 +/- 3.6%. The corresponding values for diltiazem were 100%, 92 +/- 12.5%, 79 +/- 8.9%, and 35 +/- 2.6%. In contrast, the increase of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (2-7.5 mM) resulted in a significant increase of the contraction amplitude (+213 +/- 14%). Therefore, blockade of the Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent T- or L-type Ca2+ channels decreases contraction in isolated cardiac myocytes from guinea pigs containing L- and T-type Ca2+ channels.", 
    "51": "Skin conductance level (SCL) and spectral analysis of variations in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), in relation to plasma catecholamine concentrations, were used to evaluate autonomic nervous system activity during situations of supine rest within a period of 4 h after oral administration of 1 mg alprazolam and 2 mg lorazepam. Twelve healthy men received in a double-blind, randomized crossover design, either 1 mg alprazolam, or 2 mg lorazepam, or a placebo on different days. ECG, BP, respiration, and SCL were monitored continuously during each session. For HR, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) time series, power spectra were calculated per 5 min for three 15-min periods at 30 min, 1 h and 45 min, and 3 h after dosing. Spectral power was assessed for three frequency bands: low (0.02-0.06 Hz), mid (0.07-0.14 Hz), and high (0.15-0.50 Hz). Per time segment, the gain in the mid-frequency band between the systolic BP values and the RR interval times was computed as index of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Blood samples for assay of plasma catecholamines were obtained after each 15-min period. Alprazolam reduced DBP during the whole recording period; the effect was accompanied by an initial increase of mid-frequency band fluctuations of BP at 30 min, which subsequently decreased at 1 h 45 min and 3 h after dose administration, in comparison with placebo (suggesting an initial reflectory increase, followed by an attenuation of sympathetic tone). The BP effects were accompanied by a reduction of plasma noradrenaline concentrations. HR showed a time-dependent decrease after alprazolam and an increase in high-frequency band fluctuations of HR and BRS (suggesting a time-dependent increase in cardiac vagal tone). SCL was decreased after alprazolam administration. Lorazepam did not show a time-dependent reduction of HR and had no effect on BP, but increased low-frequency band power of HR and DBP and mildly reduced SCL. Alprazolam and lorazepam had no effect on respiratory frequency. Noninvasive indices of autonomic regulation revealed several small, but significant, time-dependent effects of 1 mg alprazolam on sympathetic and parasympathetic processes, whereas for 2 mg lorazepam, these effects were less clear. The reduction in noninvasive indices of sympathetic tone after alprazolam administration corresponded with the attenuation of plasma noradrenaline concentrations by alprazolam.", 
    "52": "We examined the anxiolytic potential of perospirone, a novel serotonin-2 and dopamine-2 antagonist (SDA)-type antipsychotic agent, and compared its effects with those of the standard anxiolytic diazepam and the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol by using conditioned defensive burying (CDB) and social interaction (SI) tests in rats. The tests were conducted 1 h after oral administration of the drug. Diazepam inhibited CDB specifically directed toward a probe previously associated with brief electric shock and increased the time spent in SI by pairs of naive rats in a brightly illuminated novel environment. Perospirone mimicked the effects of diazepam by dose dependently suppressing CDB and facilitating SI. In contrast, haloperidol failed to inhibit CDB or increase SI. These results suggested that, unlike the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol, perospirone exerts anxiolytic-like effects in animal models with different motivational and emotional states. A braoder efficacy of perospirone for the treatment of anxiety and related symptoms in schizophrenia is discussed.", 
    "53": "Rats from the N/Nih heterogeneous stock have been selectively bred for high (HAS) or low (LAS) initial sensitivity to injected ethanol as measured by duration of the loss of the righting reflex. The selection for ethanol sensitivity in these lines apparently has reached a maximum. These lines are useful to elucidate the central nervous system mechanisms of the genetic differences between the lines and also provide clues to the mechanisms of ethanol's action. We have found that: 1) ethanol, etomidate, and ketamine but not propofol produce different sleep times and brain levels of the drug on awakening between these two lines; 2) only ethanol, etomidate, and ketamine produced significant differences between the HAS and LAS rats in GABA-mediated stimulation of chloride uptake into brain microsacs; 3) GABA, propofol, and etomidate decreased the Kd for flunitrazepam binding to whole-brain membranes but equally in both lines. Neither ethanol nor ketamine had an effect; 4) only GABA, ethanol, and etomidate increased the Kd for TBPS binding and only GABA decreased Bmax of TBPS binding. As with the previous selection for ethanol sensitivity in mice (short and long sleep) these lines of rats have very marked line differences in GABA-mediated events, and these are correlated with the sedative effects of ethanol. From these and previous studies we know that the major differences between selected lines of mice and rats are that the mouse lines are not differentially sensitive to halothane or pentobarbital while the rat lines are. However, the mouse lines are differentially sensitive to propofol and the rat lines are not. These data should be useful in dissecting the actions of ethanol at the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "54": "Clobazam is the first and only 1,5-benzodiazepine to be used in the management of epilepsy. The use and effectiveness of oral clobazam in patients with status epilepticus has only been previously described in one study of 16 cases, seven of whom were in complex partial status. We have used clobazam in four patients with EEG-proven partial status epilepticus refractory to standard antiepileptic drugs. In all cases, except one, the seizure activity was controlled within 2 hr of administering clobazam. Our four patients responded promptly to an oral loading of clobazam which was approximately twice the usual daily maintenance dose. The drug was well tolerated and no adverse effects were seen. Clobazam's effectiveness as a first-line agent remains to be studied. Further controlled studies are recommended.",

The conclusion was that it is possible to train staff in the mainstream educational environment in the special health needs of children with unstable epilepsy thereby supporting continued attendance at the school of choice.", 
    "58": "In horizontal cells freshly dissociated from crucian carp (Carassius auratus) retina, we recorded the whole-cell responses to rapid application of glutamate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate. Currents induced by glutamate and AMPA, but not by kainate, usually showed extremely rapid desensitization. 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl- 4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53655), a selective AMPA receptor antagonist, was found to completely block glutamate- and kainate-induced currents, which were supposed to be mediated by activation of AMPA receptors. We further extensively studied the kinetics of desensitization of glutamate- and AMPA-induced currents in horizontal cells. The time constants for decay of whole-cell currents induced by glutamate and AMPA were 1.9 and 1.4 ms, respectively, and the equilibrium responses to glutamate and AMPA at concentrations over 1 mM were invariably less than 10% of the corresponding peak responses. We have determined the values of EC50 for glutamate and AMPA as 1.08 and 1.05 mM, respectively, which are nearly 100-fold higher than that reported previously. Dose dependence of desensitization was also investigated and the glutamate concentration for a half desensitization was 26 microM, much lower than the EC50. Furthermore, kainate and AMPA interacted at AMPA receptors of horizontal cells in a dual competitive manner: the response to kainate of low concentration (10 microM) was potentiated by the addition of 300 microM AMPA, while the responses induced by kainate of relatively higher doses (300 microM or more) were reduced. We conclude that crucian carp horizontal cells may exclusively express the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors, which is characterized by extremely rapid desensitization.", 
    "59": "The availability of automated, rapid and reliable methods for the systematic toxicological analysis (STA) of drugs and poisons in biosamples is of great importance in clinical and forensic toxicology laboratories. Gas chromatography-continuous scan mass spectrometry (GC-MS) possesses a high potential in STA because of its selectivity and identification power. However, in order to develop a fully automated STA method based on GC-MS two main obstacles have to be overcome: (a) sample preparation is rather sophisticated owing to the need to isolate analytes from the aqueous matrix and to allow a correct GC repartition of polar analytes; (b) the large amount of information collected within a single analysis makes it difficult to isolate relevant analytical information (mass spectra of analytes) from the chemical noise. Using a bench-top GC-MS system equipped with a laboratory robot for sample preparation (the Hewlett-Packard 7686 PrepStation) and an original method for mass spectral purification, a fully automated STA procedure was developed involving isolation of drugs from the sample (whole blood with minimal pretreatment, plasma, urine) by means of solid-phase extraction, derivatization (trimethylsilylation) of the acidic-neutral and of the basic extracts, GC-MS analysis, processing of data, and reporting of results. Each step of the procedure, and the method for data analysis in particular, can be easily integrated with other existing STA methods based on GC-MS.", 
    "60": "A review of methods for the measurement of benzodiazepines in biological specimens published over the last five years is presented. A range of immunoassay procedures using EIA, ELISA, FPIA, agglutination or kinetic interaction of microparticles, or RIA methods are now available. Cross reactivities to benzodiazepines are variable such that no one kit will recognise all benzodiazepines and their relevant metabolites at concentrations likely to be encountered during therapeutic use. Prior hydrolysis of urine to convert glucuronide metabolites to immunoreactive substances improves detection limits for many benzodiazepines. Several radioreceptor assays have now been published and show good sensitivity and specificity to benzodiazepines and offer the advantage (over immunoassay) of being able to detect these drugs with equal sensitivity. Solvent extraction techniques using a variety of solvents were still popular and offer acceptable recoveries and lack of significant interference from other substances. A number of papers describing solid phase extraction procedures were also published. Direct injection of specimens into a HPLC column with back flushing were also successfully described. Seventy two chromatographic methods using HPLC, LC-MS, GC and GC-MS methods were reviewed. HPLC was able to achieve detection limits for many benzodiazepines using UV or DAD detection down to 1-2 ng/ml using 1-2 ml of urine or serum (blood). ECD detectors gave detection limits better than 1 ng/ml from 1 ml of specimen, which was an order of magnitude lower than for NPD. EI-MS offered similar sensitivity, whilst NCI-MS was capable of detection down to 0.1 ng/ml. Methods suitable for the separation of enantiomers of benzodiazepines have been described using HPLC. Electrokinetic micellar chromatography has also been shown to be capable of the analysis of benzodiazepines in urine.", 
    "61": "Up to now, more than 50 pharmaceuticals or drugs of abuse have been reported to be detectable in hair after oral or parenteral administration. The present paper reviews the literature devoted to drug testing in hair that has been published since 1992. Procedures for the detection of opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis in hair are described in detail. In particular, the papers on benzodiazepines show an increasing number of procedures using negative chemical ionisation with GC-MS and diode array detection with HPLC in hair analysis. For the most important benzodiazepines, diazepam and flunitrazepam, reliable methods now exist. On the other hand, the problem of the detecting tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites using different techniques is not yet solved. Some progress is observed in the detection of low dose drugs, like fentanyl and its derivatives or LSD. For most of the analyses using chromatographic techniques, the main data on sample preparation and analytical determinations are listed. Some new findings, based on the experience of the authors, are also added.", 
    "62": "The detection of marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, PCP, alcohol and nicotine in saliva and sweat is reviewed, with emphasis on forensic applications. The short window of detection and lower levels of drugs present compared to levels found in urine limits the applications of sweat and saliva screening for drug use determination. However, these matrices may be applicable for use in driving while intoxicated and surveying populations for illicit drug use. Although not an illicit drug, the detection of ethanol is reviewed because of its importance in driving under the influence. Only with alcohol may saliva be used to estimate blood levels and the degree of impairment because of the problems with oral contamination and drug concentrations varying depending upon how the saliva is obtained. The detection of nicotine and cotinine (from smoking tobacco) is also covered because of its use in life insurance screening and surveying for passive exposure.", 
    "63": "The development of low cost MS detectors in recent years has promoted an important increase in the applicability of GC-MS system to analyze for the presence of foreign substances in the human body. Drugs and toxic agents are in vivo metabolized in such a way that more polar compounds are usually formed. Derivatization of these metabolites is often an unavoidable requirement for gas chromatographic analysis. Application of derivatization methods in recent years has been relevant, especially for silylation, acylation, alkylation and the formation of cyclic or diastereomeric derivatives. Given the relevance of drug of abuse testing in modern toxicology, main derivatization procedures for opiates, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and LSD have been reviewed. Papers describing the analyses of drugs of abuse in matrixes other than blood, such as hair or sweat, have received special attention. Advances in derivatization for sports drug testing have been particularly relevant for anabolic steroids, diuretics and corticosteroids. Among the several methodologies applied, the formation of trimethylsilyl, perfluoroacyl or methylated derivatives have proved to be both versatile and extensively used. Further advances in derivatization for GC-MS applications in clinical and forensic toxicology will depend on the one hand on the degree of further use of GC-MS for routine applications and, on the other hand, on the alternative progress made for developments in LC-MS or CE-MS. Last but not least, the appearance of comprehensive libraries in which reference spectra for different derivatives of many drugs and their metabolites are collected will have an important impact on the expansion of derivatization in GC-MS for toxicological applications.",

Papers published from 1995 to early 1997, which are relevant to clinical toxicology, forensic toxicology, doping control or drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, were taken into consideration. They cover the following analytes: amphetamines, cocaine, lysergide (LSD), opiates, anabolics, antihypertensives, benzodiazepines, cardiac glycosides, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, neuroleptics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids, quaternary amines, xanthins, biogenic poisons such as aconitines, aflatoxins, amanitins and nicotine, and pesticides. LC-MS interface types, mass spectral detection modes, sample preparation procedures and chromatographic systems applied in the reviewed papers are discussed. Basic information about the biosample assayed, work-up, LC column, mobile phase, interface type, mass spectral detection mode, and validation data of each procedure is summarized in tables. Examples of typical LC-MS applications are presented.", 
    "65": "The question of whether systemic use of corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations in people has still not been resolved. Here, we present the results of a case-control study on the relationship of corticosteroids during pregnancy and oral clefts in the newborn infant. Data are derived from the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC). Case subjects were 1,184 liveborn infants with nonsyndromic oral clefts. The results of the logistic regression analysis, show a relationship between exposure to corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy and an increased risk of cleft lip (with or without cleft palate) in the newborn infants (OR = 6.55; CI = 1.44-29.76; P = 0.015), controlled for potential confounder factors, such as maternal smoking, maternal hyperthermia, first-degree malformed relatives with cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and maternal treatment with antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, metronidazole, or sex hormones during the first trimester of pregnancy. Thus, we believe that the use of corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy, should be restricted to the following situations: for life-threatening situations, for those diseases without any other safe therapeutic alternative, or for those cases with replacement therapy.", 
    "66": "The direct cardiac effects of morphine, alfentanil, ketamine, etomidate, thiopentone, midazolam and propofol were measured in isolated Wistar rat hearts. Experiments were performed using a multiple columnar Langendorff apparatus and the hearts were perfused with a modified Tyrode solution under constant pressure. Each drug was applied from a different column in rising concentrations at 5-min intervals. Dose ranges were chosen to compare effects at sub-clinical, clinically relevant and more than clinical concentrations. Six rat hearts were chosen at random for each drug. Only thiopentone reduced contractile force at a clinically relevant concentration: measured as g contractility per g heart weight-1 (mean +/- standard deviation), base-line contractility was 8.8 +/- 2.4, and contractility at 10(-4) mol litre-1 thiopentone was 7.1 +/- 1.5 (P < 0.01). Alfentanil was the only drug to have no significant effect on the isolated heart at any concentration. Propofol was not cardiodepressant at clinically relevant concentrations, but had a lower therapeutic range than the other drugs.", 
    "67": "An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's contracture. After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.", 
    "68": "We have investigated the Ca2+ permeability of native kainate- and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate- (AMPA) receptors in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells. Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) increases and Mn2+ quench of fura-2 (a measure of Ca2+ entry) mediated by kainate receptors were completely dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+. Kainate receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i rises were reduced 37% by the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (1 microM). AMPA receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i rises observed in Na+-free buffer were sensitive to Joro spider toxin (500 nM) blockade showing a 65% reduction, while kainate receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i responses were largely insensitive. These results suggest that a component of AMPA receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i increases occurs through Ca2+ permeable receptors which lack the GluR2 subunit and are Joro spider toxin sensitive. In contrast, kainate receptors do not appear to directly gate significant Ca2+ but raise [Ca2+]i through activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and seem largely insensitive to Joro spider toxin.", 
    "69": "Difficulties in anxiety treatment is emphasized by benzodiazepine use and misuse. Pathological anxiety threshold can be understood in a dimensional perspective or by large in philosophical considerations. Therapeutic guidelines can be defined on the length of disease or by a categorical and nosological approach. Actually, this one appears more efficient. Numerous studies lead to better selection of psychotropics for each disorders (panic disorder; general anxiety disorder; social phobia; obsessive-compulsive disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder). Therapeutic choice is under others conditions such as length of prescription, severity of the disorders; comorbidity; individual feature to patient. Improvement in therapeutic efficacy needs further studies. Some directions could be: better definition of disorders and their link with personality, appreciation of intensity and chronicity, biological parameters.", 
    "70": "Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a progressive, rare childhood disease characterized by severe epilepsy, hemiplegia, dementia, and inflammation of the brain. While one mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RE has been hypothesized to be mediated by production of excitotoxic GluR3 autoantibodies to the AMPA receptor, other neuropathological etiologies have also been indicated. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of GABA(A) receptor mediated responses were conducted in neurons acutely isolated from an RE patient, and compared to properties of non-focal human temporal cortical neurons. RE neurons appeared similar anatomically to control cortical neurons. Significant differences in GABAergic responses were evident between RE and control neurons. GABA was significantly more potent in RE than in control cortical neurons (EC50 of 13 microM vs 23 microM, respectively). In addition, the overall efficacy of GABA was significantly decreased in RE neurons, associated with a decrease in postsynaptic GABA current density in RE neurons (5.1 pA/microm2) in comparison to controls (9.2 pA/microm2). Augmentation of GABA responses by the benzodiazepine, clonazepam (CNZ), was significantly reduced in RE in comparison to control neurons (34% vs 99% augmentation at 100 nM). The RE-associated reduced functional efficacy and altered pharmacology of neuronal GABA(A) receptors is consistent with overall disinhibition in RE neurons, and could contribute to the generation of the severe epileptic activity evident in this disorder.", 
    "71": "Ru 34000 [5-ethyl-7-methoxy-imidazo (1,2-a) pyrimidin-2-yl cyclopropyl methanone] is a novel imidazopyrimidine benzodiazepine inverse agonist that exhibits low affinity for central benzodiazepine receptors (Ki approximately 0.98 microM). The present study examined the in vivo actions of Ru 34000 (0.5-5 mg/kg) following intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c), oral (p.o.), and intraventral tegmental administration in alcohol-preferring (P) rats trained under a concurrent operant schedule (FR4-FR4) for ethanol (10% v/v) and a palatable saccharin (0.025% or 0.75% w/v) reinforcer. Ru 34000 (i.p., s.c., p.o.) markedly reduced ethanol responding by 28-96% of control levels without affecting saccharin responding, except for the highest dose level. Clear dose-dependent suppressant effects were observed with all routes of administration on ethanol responding. Flumazenil [ethyl-8-fluro-5, 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-4H-imidazo [1,5-a]-[1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate] (6 mg/kg; i.p.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist reversed the Ru 34000-reduction of ethanol responding, suggesting that the effects were mediated at the benzodiazepine receptor. Bilateral microinjections of Ru 34000 (50, 100, 200 ng) into the ventral tegmental area dose-dependently reduced ethanol responding by as much as 97% of control levels. The results suggest that the in vivo actions of Ru 34000 are determined not only by its binding affinity, but also by its bioavailability at active benzodiazepine sites and route of drug administration. Low affinity imidazopyrimidines may be useful pharmacological probes to further understand the role of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex in ethanol motivated behaviors.", 
    "72": "Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute agitation frequently require physical and chemical restraint. To determine the efficacy of lorazepam vs. droperidol, we conducted a prospective, randomized study of violently agitated patients requiring chemical restraint. Patients were randomized to receive either lorazepam or droperidol i.v. A six-point sedation scale was used. Sedation scores were recorded at time 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min. Vital signs were compared at time 0 and at 60 min. Repeat dosages of each drug could be given at 30 min. Toxicology screen, ethanol and creatinine phosphokinase levels were obtained. A total of 202 patients were evaluated. One hundred patients received lorazepam and 102 patients received droperidol. Agitation was attributed to methamphetamine toxicity in 146 patients (72%), cocaine toxicity in 28 (14%), psychiatric illness in 20 (10%), and ethanol withdrawal in 8 (4%). Ethanol intoxication was present in 98 patients (49%). Both drugs had similar sedation profiles at 5 min. Patients receiving droperidol had significantly lower sedation scores at times 10, 15, 30, and 60 than lorazepam. More repeat doses of lorazepam were given (40) than droperidol (8) at 30 min. We conclude that droperidol produces a more rapid and better sedation than lorazepam at the doses used in this study in agitated patients requiring chemical restraint. Lorazepam is more likely to require repeat dosing than droperidol. Methamphetamine toxicity was present in the majority of patients in this study.", 
    "73": "The effects of one and five electroshock seizures on [3H]flunitrazepam binding, diazepam-insensitive (DIS) [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding, and levels of mRNA for GABA(A) receptor alpha1, alpha4, beta3 and gamma2 subunits were examined in rats. No changes in any parameter were observed in the CA1 region of hippocampus or in parietal cortex. However, a single seizure produced a rapid and transient increase of alpha4 mRNA in the dentate gyrus, without altering the expression of the other subunits. The putative alpha4 protein, as measured by DIS [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding, was also elevated in the dentate gyrus by a single shock. Repeated electroshock (48-h intervals) resulted in an enhanced response of the alpha4 subunit to the seizure. Neither one nor five seizures altered [3H]flunitrazepam binding.", 
    "74": "The rationale for use of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists is based on the so-called benzodiazepine pathogenetic hypothesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). To assess the efficacy of flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, in a large and selected population of cirrhotic patients with severe HE, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial on 527 cirrhotic patients with HE grade III and IVa admitted to Intensive Care Units over a 5-year period; among them, 265 (132 of grade III and 133 of grade IVa) received flumazenil, whereas 262 (130 of grade III and 132 of grade IVa) received placebo. Treatment was begun within 15 minutes of randomization; the response to treatment was assessed by neurological score and by continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Improvement of the neurological score was documented in 17.5% of grade III patients treated with flumazenil and in 14.7% of grade IVa patients, compared, respectively, with 3.8% and 2.7% of the patients of both groups treated with placebo. Improvements in EEG tracings were observed in 27.8% of grade III patients and in 21.5% of grade IVa patients, compared, respectively, with 5% and 3.3% of the patients of both groups treated with placebo. Benzodiazepines were detected in the serum of 10 patients (4 in grade III group and 6 in grade IVa group).

The mean age of patients was 3.5 years (range, 1 month to 18 years). Nine children had epilepsy, one purulent meningitis, one encephalitis, one acute cerebral infarction, and the remaining four had acute phase of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The type of the seizure was a generalized tonic clonic seizure (including a partial seizure secondarily generalized) in 41 episodes, a tonic seizure in 3, an atypical absence in 1, and a complex partial seizure in 3, respectively. All patients received intravenous midazolam at 0.15 mg/kg as bolus, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.1-0.15 mg/kg/hr initially. The dose was increased gradually up to 0.3 mg/kg/hr until the complete control of seizures was achieved. Fourty-one of the 48 episodes of seizures were controlled within 30 minutes after the initiation of midazolam therapy. The mean infusion rate of midazolam required was 0.22 mg/kg/hr. The mean duration of the treatment was 4.1 days. None of the patients had serious changes in the blood pressure or respiratory status attributable to the use of midazolam. In conclusion, midazolam infusion is an effective and safe therapeutic approach for the management of childhood status epilepticus.", 
    "76": "A dynamic digital brain phantom was created from the MRI to evaluate visually the relationship between the noise and the error in the parameter estimates in the PET kinetic analysis. This phantom incorporates the noise level depending on administration dose, camera efficiency and the data acquisition schedule. We simulated a serial dynamic scan with 18F-FDG or 11C-flumazenil, assuming 2-tissue 3-parameter model and 1-tissue 2-parameter model, respectively, and the sampling schedule was determined according to the clinical examination. The noise in the tissue time activity curve in FDG had a peak in the first minute and decreased thereafter, whereas the noise increased gradually in the flumazenil study after the initial peak due to radioactivity decay. We examined the relationship between the noise level and the error in the parameter estimates. Both mean absolute differences between true and estimated values and standard deviation became large, and the quality of the parametric images became poor with increasing noise level. This simulation was compared with human tissue time activity curves and parametric images, which were obtained with 100 MBq administration dose in FDG study and 430 MBq in flumazenil study. We inferred that the noise level in the human study was 10-20% in FDG, and 20-40% in flumazenil, and the error in the estimated parameter of K-complex in FDG study was about 20%, that of DV in flumazenil study was 2%.",

    "78": "Arrhythmia due to ischaemia and/or reperfusion is an important problem, especially in open heart surgery and for patients with ischaemic heart diseases undergoing non-cardiac surgery. This experimental study is planned to evaluate the effects of midazolam on ischaemia and/or reperfusion-induced arrhythmias by comparison with thiopentone in two sets of experiments (n = 20 for every group). In total ischaemia-reperfusion experiments, hearts were perfused in constant pressure conditions. In the control group, after a stabilisation period, perfusion was totally stopped for 30 min and the hearts were reperfused for 10 min. For the experimental groups, hearts were pretreated for 5 min with either 10-6 mol 1-1 midazolam or 10-5 mol 1-1 thiopentone before total ischaemia and reperfused for 10 min with the same concentrations of the drugs. In low-flow ischaemia-reperfusion experiments, hearts were perfused at a constant flow of 10 ml g-1 heart per min initially. In the control group, after a stabilisation period, perfusion rate was decreased successively 1 ml g-1 heart per min for 10 min (mild ischaemia) and to 0.2 ml g-1 heart per min for another 10 min (severe ischaemia). The ischaemic hearts were then reperfused for an additional 10 min at a flow rate of 10 ml g-1 heart per min. Electrogram recordings were evaluated before ischaemia and at the 5th and 10th min of mild ischaemia, severe ischaemia and reperfusion. Midazolam, 10-6 mol 1-1, or thiopentone, 10-5 mol 1-1, were added to the perfusion solution in the midazolam and thiopentone groups, respectively. In these two groups, hearts were perfused according to perfusion rates mentioned above in the control group. As a commonly used i.v. anaesthetic, thiopentone was arrhythmogenic for hearts exposed to ischaemia-reperfusion by increasing ventricular premature beat (% incidences for control, midazolam and thiopental groups in the 10th min of reperfusion were 25, 15 and 65 in total ischaemia-reperfusion experiments, P < 0.01) and ventricular tachycardia (respective % incidences were 0, 5, 25, P < 0.05) incidences, but in our experiments were found out that the new agent midazolam does not have more arrhythmia incidence than the respective control group in any criteria evaluated. None of the agents exerted atrioventricular conductance abnormalities. So we conclude that midazolam is a safe agent for ischaemic hearts and might also be antiarrhythmic and the mechanism of action of this effect remains to be further investigated.",

    "84": "Patients (n = 95) with urolithiasis underwent pain measurement and scoring prior to ESWL. 'Threshold of pain' (TP) and 'maximal tolerable pain (MTP) were assessed by inducing ischemia pain with the submaximum effort tourniquet technique. Pain intensity was assessed by a verbal rating scale (VRS). The results of pain measurement and amount of analgosedation were correlated in two phases. Patients were administered an oral premedication of 0.1 mg/kg midazolam. Phase 1: 60 patients were randomized into three groups: (1) piritramide (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) and midazolam (1-3 mg) i.v. (2) Lidocaine/prilocaine cream topically (30 g) to skin and diclofenac supp. 100 mg. (3) No analgesia. Phase 2: Based on the data of phase 1, cut-off points for TP and MTP were set for female and male patients. In accordance with these results, 35 patients comprised group 1 for anesthesia with piritramide/midazolam, group 2 with lidocaine/prilocaine cream and diclofenac supp. and group 3 for no analgesia at all. The electromagnetic shockwave sources Modulith SLX and Lithostar Plus were utilized.", 
    "85": "Phase 1: All patients randomized for group 1 (intravenous analgosedation) were treated in accordance with the protocol. 65% of group 2 (cream/suppository) tolerated treatment as planned. 35% of patients selected for ESWL without analgesia (group 3) remained within this group. Patients requiring additional analgosedation displayed lower TP and MTP. The cut-off points for females and males were TP >/=25/35 s and MTP >/=45/60 s, respectively. Phase 2: 20/35 patients were preselected for a nonintravenous protocol. Five out of these 20 violated the protocol. The rate of additionally administered analgesia was lower than in phase 1: 35:10% in group 2 (cream/supp.), 65:40% in group 3 (no analgesia).",

A third phase of this study recruiting a large number of patients will contribute to the confirmation of these results.", 
    "87": "Since the adrenal cortex and medulla are intimately interrelated, the effects of anticonvulsant drugs may affect both of these hormonal systems. Anticonvulsants are commonly used long-term for the treatment of epilepsy, chronic pain syndromes and affective disorders. In patients where adrenal function needs to be evaluated, the clinician should be aware of the potential interactions between anticonvulsant medication and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone induce the liver P450 cytochrome enzyme system and stimulate steroid clearance. Therefore, patients investigated for Cushing's syndrome may show a falsely positive dexamethasone suppression test, and patients with adrenal insufficiency on steroid replacement may require increased doses of steroids; furthermore, increased corticosteroid-binding-globulin levels are also associated with chronic anticonvulsant administration. In addition, concomitant treatment with benzodiazepines, probably acting via the GABA pathway, can also alter the ACTH/cortisol response to stressful stimuli. Direct and indirect evidence suggest that benzodiazepines, acetazolamide and magnesium sulphate can also interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Finally, to our knowledge, no systemic data are yet available in the human on the effect of antiepileptics on the function of the adrenal medulla and/or catecholamine metabolism; however, as the adrenal medulla receives part of its blood supply from the cortex, it is possible that alterations of cortical hormonal composition might affect adrenal medulla function overall.", 
    "88": "The present series of experiments compared the behavioral effects of the novel non-peptide CRF antagonist CP-154,526 with those of diazepam and the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist buspirone in classical animal models of anxiety including conflict tests (punished lever pressing and punished drinking tests in rats) and exploratory models (elevated plus-maze test in rats, light/dark choice and free-exploration tests in mice), and a recently developed mouse defense test battery (MDTB) which has been validated for the screening of anxiolytic drugs. Results from both conflict procedures showed that diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) produced clear anxiolytic-like effects, whereas buspirone (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) displayed anticonflict activity in the punished drinking test only. CP-154,526 (0.6-20 mg/kg) was devoid of significant activity in both procedures. In the elevated plus-maze, diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) produced significant effects on traditional (i.e. spatio-temporal) and ethologically derived (i.e. risk assessment and directed exploration) indices of anxiety. Buspirone (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced risk assessment activities only, and CP-154,526 (0.6-20 mg/kg, i.p.) did not modify the indices of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. In the light/dark test, diazepam (2.5-5 mg/kg, i.p.) and CP-154,526 (10-40 mg/kg, i.p.) affected all behavioral indices of anxiety, while buspirone reduced risk assessment activities at the highest doses only (10 and 15 mg/kg, i.p.). In the free-exploration test, diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced avoidance responses towards novelty, as indicated by the increase in exploratory activity in a novel compartment and the decrease in risk assessment. CP-154,526 failed to affect the former behavior and weakly reduced the latter (5 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.). Buspirone (1.25-5 mg/kg, i.p.) was inactive in this test. Finally, in the MDTB, diazepam (0.5-3 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated all defensive reactions of mice confronted with a rat stimulus (i.e. flight, risk assessment and defensive attack) or with a situation associated with this threat (i.e. contextual defense). Buspirone (1.25-5 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced defensive attack and contextual defense, while CP-154,526 (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) affected all defensive behaviors, with the exception of one risk assessment measure. The finding that CP-154,526 displayed positive effects in mice but not in rats may be due to increased sensitivity to environmental stress of the strains used (i.e. BALB/c, Swiss) and/or to the fact that animals were exposed to unavoidable stress stimuli which may lead to a significant activation of the CRF system. Although in mice the anxiety-reducing potential of CP-154,526 is superior to that of the atypical anxiolytic buspirone, it is smaller in terms of the magnitude of the effects and the number of indices of anxiety affected than that of diazepam.", 
    "89": "The discriminative stimulus effects of buspirone and diazepam were examined in 12 healthy volunteers using a three-response drug discrimination procedure and a within-subject design. During an initial sampling phase, the training drug conditions (placebo, 15 mg/70 kg buspirone, and 10 mg/70 kg diazepam) were identified to subjects by letter codes before oral drug administration. During a subsequent training phase, subjects earned money for correct drug identifications made two hours after drug administration. Ten out of 12 subjects acquired the three-response discrimination. When lower doses of buspirone (3.75 and 7.5 mg/70 kg) and diazepam (2.5 and 5.0 mg/70 kg) were tested in a subsequent generalization testing phase, both buspirone and diazepam produced dose-related increases in appropriate drug identifications, without significant cross-generalization. Analyses of standardized and unstructured self report questionnaires revealed that buspirone and diazepam produced different profiles of effects, and that buspirone was associated with a number of \"negative\" subject-rated effects including tension, nausea, and dizziness. These results demonstrate a distinct profile of discriminative stimulus and subjective effects for buspirone relative to diazepam which is consistent with its distinct pharmacological profile, and provide evidence for the sensitivity of the three-response drug discrimination procedure.",

    "91": "The acute effects of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist in long-term BZD users were used as a possible test to detect physiological dependence. Thirty-four subjects (20 females, 14 males) aged 26-48 years (mean + SD, 42.4+/-8.5 years), all chronic users of low doses of diazepam (5-20 mg/day, 14.2+/-4.8 mg/day) for 5 to 28 years (10.5+/-6 years), received a single 1-mg i.v. flumazenil dose or saline, infused slowly under double-blind conditions. Physiological dependence was suggested as all patients receiving flumazenil developed an anxiety reaction while the placebo group did not. Flumazenil triggered a qualitatively different reaction amounting to a panic attack during infusion in nine out of 15 patients. These patients had a diagnosis of panic disorder or a history of panic attacks. Caution should be exercised when giving flumazenil to panic patients who are taking BZDs as maintenance treatment.", 
    "92": "We have shown previously that pupil diameter increases and the amplitude of the pupillary light reflex is reduced when subjects are under threat of an aversive event (electric shock), and that light reflex amplitude correlates negatively with subjective anxiety. Furthermore, we have shown that the threat-induced reduction in light reflex amplitude is sensitive to the effect of the anxiolytic drug diazepam. We have suggested that the 'fear-inhibited light reflex' paradigm could be used as a laboratory model of human anxiety. In the present study, we examined whether a single oral dose (200 microg) of the sedative-sympatholytic drug clonidine would antagonize the effects of threat on the pupillary light reflex. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in two sessions separated by seven days in which they ingested clonidine 200 mg or placebo in a double-blind, balanced, cross-over design. Light stimuli (0.43 mW/cm2, 200 msec) were generated by a green (peak wavelength 565 nm) light-emitting diode, and pupil diameter was monitored by computerized binocular infrared television pupillometry in the dark. The light reflex response was recorded during either the anticipation of a shock ('threat' blocks) or periods in which no shocks were anticipated ('safe' blocks). The shock was a single square wave current pulse (1.5 mA, 50 msec) applied to the median nerve at the end of the experiment. Following each 'threat' or 'safe' block, subjects rated their anxiety using visual analogue scales. Two-factor ANOVA (treatment x condition) showed that clonidine treatment antagonized both the threat-induced increase in pupil diameter and the threat-induced reduction in light reflex amplitude. These effects, however, were not threat-specific since clonidine also reduced pupil diameter and enhanced light reflex amplitude in the 'safe' condition. Clonidine also reduced subjective alertness but not subjective anxiety in the 'threat' condition. These findings suggest that the mutual antagonism between clonidine and threat is likely to reflect the opposite effects of the two variables on the central noradrenergic control of pupillary functions, rather than a specific anxiolytic effect.", 
    "93": "The hypothesis that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate initiation of lasting behavioral changes induced by the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142, was supported in this study. Behavioral changes normally induced by FG-7142 were blocked when the competitive NMDA receptor blocker, 7-amino-phosphono-heptanoic acid, was given prior to administration of FG-7142. When cats were subsequently given FG-7142 alone, the drug produced lasting behavioral changes like those reported previously. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, reversed an increase in defensiveness produced by FG-7142 alone, replicating previous findings. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation in limbic pathways subserving defensive response to threat mediates lasting increases in defensiveness produced by FG-7142.",

    "98": "In utero exposure to diazepam (DZ), a positive modulator of the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptor exerts profound effects on the offspring that become most apparent after the maturation of the brain during puberty and that are often sex specific, suggesting that the early exposure might have interfered with organizing actions of sex steroids. In addition to genomic actions, many reduced steroids interact directly with membrane receptors, including the GABAA receptor. In the present study, the effect of in vitro exposure to neurosteroids on GABA-stimulated 36chloride uptake in synaptoneurosomes from adult cerebral cortex or fetal forebrain (gestation day 20) was examined. The initial study examined the effects of incubation with DZ (10 microM) and the neuroactive steroid, 3 alpha,5 beta-THP (500 nM), alone and in combination. In adult tissue, the presence of either drug alone decreased the EC50 for GABA stimulation, and incubation with both drugs had an additive effect. In fetal tissue, while both compounds decreased the EC50, an additive effect was apparent only when comparing the combined exposure to 3 alpha,5 beta-THP alone. DZ alone reduced the EC50 as much as both drugs together. In the second study, the effect of in vitro exposure to androsterone (2.5 microM) was evaluated in male and female fetal tissue separately as well as in the adult. Androsterone enhanced the sensitivity to GABA in all groups but also reduced the efficacy of GABA in fetal tissue, irrespective of gender. While neurosteroids and DZ elicited similar responses in fetal and adult tissue, the study identified a greater vulnerability of fetal GABAA receptors to modulatory compounds.",

Furthermore, one of the endogenous ligands for the BZ receptors, referred to as EBZ, has been identified as inosine based on the following observations: (1) standard inosine and the EBZ have identical NMR and UV spectra; (2) the elution profile of inosine and the EBZ from a HPLC column are indistinguishable, and (3) inosine and the EBZ show identical activity in inhibiting [3H]FNZP binding.",

Synthetic cOA has been shown to induce physiological sleep when injected into laboratory rats. Here we assess the cellular mode of action of cOA in vitro. 2. In all rat cultured cortical neurones (pyramidal cells) examined, the synthetic brain lipid (3.2-64 microM) enhanced the responses to subsaturating GABA concentrations (up to circa 2x) in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50, circa 15 microM). 3. (20 microM) cOA significantly enhanced the affinity of exogenous GABA for its receptor without changing the Hill slope or the maximal response. These effects were not voltage-dependent or secondary to shifts in E(Cl). 4. In the absence of GABA, cOA directly evoked small inhibitory currents in a subpopulation (<7%) of sensitive cells. 5. 20 microM cOA reversibly enhanced the duration of spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (circa 2 fold) without significantly altering their amplitude. 6. At 32-64 microM, cOA reversibly reduced the incidence and amplitude of both inhibitory post synaptic currents (i.p.s.cs) and excitatory post synaptic currents (e.p.s.cs) in the cultured neuronal circuits in common with other depressant drugs acting at the GABA(A) receptor. 7. 32 microM Oleic acid did not modulate exogenous GABA currents or synaptic activity suggesting that cOAs actions are mediated through a specific receptor. 8. A specific, protein-dependent interaction with GABA(A) receptors was confirmed in Xenopus oocytes. Recombinant human receptors were modulated by 10 microM cOA (and diazepam) only when a gamma2 subunit was co-expressed with alpha1beta2: the cOA response was not sensitive to the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (1 microM). 9. cOA may represent an endogenous ligand for allosteric modulatory sites on isoforms of GABA(A) receptors which are crucial for the regulation of arousal and have recently been implicated in the circadian control of physiological sleep.", 
    "103": "This study was carried out in order to determine if intravenous (i.v.) sedation with diazepam, at the time of procedure, made fibreoptic bronchoscopy more tolerable and if these perceptions persisted on later questioning. Methodology consisted of a sequential, parallel group design comparing sedation with no sedation for bronchoscopy in a tertiary referral hospital. Patient comfort and sedation desired for hypothetical repeat bronchoscopy were assessed both immediately and after at least 1 month. Patients who received sedation rated bronchoscopy as more comfortable (P = 0.01). Those who received sedation were also more likely to want no change in sedation if the bronchoscopy were repeated (P < 0.01). These differences were more evident at later questioning. Sedation was not associated with an increased complication rate but was associated with a prolonged recovery room stay (no sedation, 19.2 min (SEM 3.8) compared with sedation, 76.1 min (5.4), P < 0.001). In contrast to previous studies, our patients found bronchoscopy more comfortable with i.v. diazepam sedation. This was supported by patients who received sedation being less likely to want any change in future sedation if a repeat bronchoscopy were required. The benefit seen with sedation was more marked at later questioning supporting a previously postulated amnesic effect. However, sedation was associated with a prolonged room stay and potentially greater attendant cost.",

    "112": "Normal subjects (90), benzodiazepine consumers (14), and cirrhotic patients (113) were studied.", 
    "113": "Endogenous benzodiazepines were measured by the radioligand binding technique after high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification. The presence of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam was assayed by HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Diazepam binding inhibitor was studied in serum by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "114": "Endogenous benzodiazepines were below the limit of detection in 7% of patients with encephalopathy. When detectable, their levels were at least comparable with those of benzodiazepine consumers and correlated with the liver dysfunction but not the stage of encephalopathy. Serum levels of diazepam binding inhibitor tended to decrease when endogenous benzodiazepines levels increased.", 
    "115": "Endogenous benzodiazepines may accumulate in patients with liver cirrhosis during the course of the disease, and the phenomenon appears to be independent of the presence or absence of encephalopathy.", 
    "116": "There are situations in which \"light\" anaesthesia combined with neuromuscular block is the only anaesthetic regimen that can be tolerated safely by the patient. Benzodiazepines have hypnotic and specific amnesic effects. Therefore, we have examined the interaction of midazolam with a subanaesthetic dose of isoflurane (0.2% end-expired concentration) in 28 healthy volunteers. Thereafter, 15 subjects received midazolam 0.03 mg kg-1 i.v. and 13 subjects received midazolam 0.06 mg kg-1 in a random, double-blind manner. Word lists were administered and response to commands was tested before and after administration of midazolam. After 1 h of recovery, memory for word lists was tested by word completion, free recall and forced choice recognition tasks. After administration of midazolam, recall and, to a lesser degree, implicit memory were absent. Recognition was also absent after administration of midazolam 0.06 mg kg-1 and at the 3-min and 15-min assessments after administration of midazolam 0.03 mg kg-1. Responsiveness was more frequent with midazolam 0.03 mg kg-1 than with 0.06 mg kg-1 and increased over time. We conclude that a larger dose of midazolam or isoflurane, or both, may be necessary to abolish responsiveness.", 
    "117": "Exemplified by a randomized trial on antimanic treatment, this paper addresses the question whether selection of patients for drug trials may limit the applicability of study results from the randomized patients to a wider population. During a two-year period, all consecutively admitted patients from a defined catchment area were screened for fulfilling the inclusion criteria concerning age, diagnosis and severity of illness. The subsequently excluded subgroups of patients were compared with the randomized patients by means of multivariate data analysis. One hundred and sixty four patients met the inclusion criteria. However, after exclusion for various reasons, only 27 (17%) patients remained for randomization. The randomized patients and the excluded patients differed substantially. The generalizability of trial results is limited. Reports of randomized drug trials should carefully describe the screening procedure for inclusion, and, when possible, present relevant comparisons between the randomized patients and the various subgroups of patients meeting the exclusion criteria.", 
    "118": "Starting from 3-(3-chloro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-1H-quinoxalin-2-one (2) a series of substituted [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines (3a-f) was prepared via a multistep reaction sequence. Affinities of the novel derivatives 3a-f for benzodiazepine as well as for adenosine A1- and A2A-receptors of rat brain were determined by radioligand binding assays. 1-Methyl-4-(3-chloro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl) derivative 3a exhibited submicromolar affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors (Ki = 340 nM) and was less potent at A1-(Ki = 7.85 microM) and A2A-(Ki = 1.43 microM) adenosine receptors (AR). Derivatives with larger substituents in the 1-position showed reduced binding to benzodiazepine and A2A-AR, but increased A1-AR affinity, the 2-thienylmethyl derivative 3f being the most potent and selective A1-AR ligand of the present series (Ki = 200 nM).", 
    "119": "Two cases are reported of patients who developed agranulocytosis after treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics. The patients were successfully treated with olanzapine. We suggest the consideration of olanzapine as a safer treatment in patients who require immediate continuation of antipsychotic medication and have a prior history of classic and atypical neuroleptic-induced agranulocytosis.", 
    "120": "The ideal properties for an antipanic agent include the ability to provide complete recovery from panic attacks, resolution of associated anxiety and avoidance behavior, relapse prevention, good tolerability, and efficacy in comorbid conditions including depression. We compared the properties of currently available treatment options for panic attacks, including the benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with this ideal. Experimental approaches in the development of therapeutic agents of potential use against panic disorder were also examined. It is clear that SSRIs, such as paroxetine, are an effective treatment for panic disorder, and their antidepressant activity also allows concurrent treatment of comorbid depressive disorders, for which patients with panic disorder are at high risk. However, despite the availability of effective antipanic agents, some patients do not respond to treatment.", 
    "121": "Early intervention aimed at secondary prevention is a high priority for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) research. Disrupted sleep may have a role in the initiation and maintenance of PTSD. Three of the participants were recruited from a surgical trauma service, and one had sought treatment in a psychiatric setting. All were within 1-3 weeks of trauma exposure and had acute PTSD symptoms that included disturbed sleep. Temazepam, a benzodiazepine hypnotic, was administered for 5 nights, tapered for 2 nights, and then discontinued. Evaluations 1-week after the medication had been discontinued revealed improved sleep and reduced PTSD severity. These observations suggest an approach that may be clinically useful and a need for more systematic trials.", 
    "122": "It has been shown many times that in experiments on mice systemic administration of anticonvulsive doses of diazepam caused a 15-20-fold higher effect against the endogenous convulsant kynurenine (injection into the brain ventricles) than against corasol (systemic injection). In the present work diazepam (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) prevented convulsions induced in nonbred and C57B1/6 mice by equally effective doses of corasol injected subcutaneously (80 mg/kg) better than in injection into the brain ventricles (500 micrograms). In injection of the three drugs into the ventricles diazepam (0.5-10 micrograms) relieved to a similar degree convulsions induced by equally effective doses of corasol (500 micrograms) and kynurenine (50 micrograms). It follows from this that the unique resistance the kynurenine convulsions to diazepam is due to the fact that only kynurenine is injected into the brain ventricles whereas all the other convulsants compared with it are administered systemically. It is suggested that besides the route of administration, the more significant dependence of kynurenine convulsions on GAMA(B) receptors and the activity of the brain dopaminergic system is responsible for the difference in the diazepam sensitivity of kynurenine and corasol convulsions.", 
    "123": "We evaluated the clinical efficacy and the tolerance of Nabumetone (N), in comparison with a pool of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in a cohort of patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, non-articular rheumatisms and primary fibromyalgic syndrome.", 
    "124": "One hundred and seventy patients were observed in an open-non randomized study. The patients have been recruited alternatively and subdivided into two groups: 84 patients that received N and 86 patients that received one of the other NSAIDs. All the patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis received a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (OH-chloroquine, d-penicillamine, auranofin, cyclosporine-A); while benzodiazepines are administered in the patients suffering from primary fibromyalgic syndrome. A follow-up not inferior to 12 consecutive weeks was realized and the following clinical parameters were studied: spontaneous pain, provoked pain, pain on active movement, pain on passive movement, pain at rising, pain at bed time, morning stiffness, limited joint mobility, number of tender points, number of affected joints and number of swollen joints. All the patients were monitored for hematological, biochemical, urinary and clotting tests.", 
    "125": "The results revealed an excellent tolerability of nabumetone with a clinical efficacy not inferior to the NSAIDs' pool. Moreover, the number of drop-outs in the N-group were significantly inferior in comparison to the NSAIDs'-pool group.", 
    "126": "We conclude that N can be considered as effective as other NSAIDs. Moreover it seems to be better tolerated that the other NSAIDs utilized in our study.", 
    "127": "In animal models of epilepsy, calcium entry blockers have shown anticonvulsant properties. We studied the antiepileptic effects of nimodipine and two novel dihydropyridines, a calcium antagonist (PCA 50922) and a calcium agonist (PCA 50941), on pentylenetetrazole seizure and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) in mice. Anticonvulsant profile of nimodipine and PCA 50922 was similar to that of clonazepam, but markedly different from that of phenytoin. None of the doses of the PCA 50941 showed anticonvulsant effect.", 
    "128": "Ethanol dependence, arising from chronic ethanol exposure, is associated with neuroadaptations of GABAA receptors, evidenced by alterations in various behaviors, receptor responsiveness and subunit gene expression. The present studies explored the effects of ethanol dependence in female rats for comparison with previous studies in our laboratory using male rats. We found that ethanol dependence resulted in differential effects on GABAA receptor gene expression in female rat cerebral cortex compared to ethanol dependent male rats. Notably, chronic ethanol consumption did not change GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit peptide levels in ethanol dependent female rat cortex, in contrast to previously observed decreases in alpha 1 subunit expression in ethanol dependent male rat cortex. The effects of ethanol dependence on additional GABAA receptor subunit peptide levels (alpha 4, beta 2/3 and gamma 2) were similar, but not identical, between female and male rat cortex. When directly compared within the experiment, male and female rats had similar baseline bicuculline seizure thresholds and displayed a similar increase in seizure susceptibility during ethanol withdrawal. Ethanol withdrawn female rats were cross tolerant to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam, similar to the findings in ethanol withdrawn male rats. Ethanol withdrawn female rats showed a dose-dependent enhancement of the anticonvulsant effect of the neuroactive steroid, THDOC (3 alpha,21-dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one) compared to control animals. This finding is similar to previous observations of increased sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effect of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one) in ethanol withdrawn male and female rats. In addition, low dose administration of THDOC elevated seizure thresholds in ethanol withdrawn female but not male rats, suggesting that ethanol withdrawn female rats were more responsive to the anticonvulsant effects of this neurosteroid than were ethanol withdrawn male rats. These findings show that gender impacts on adaptations in GABAA receptors elicited by ethanol dependence. However, the physiological outcomes of the differential alterations are not clear. Taken together, these studies suggest that additional mechanisms, beyond effects on GABAA receptor gene expression are involved in the mediation of ethanol dependence and withdrawal.", 
    "129": "It has been shown that the depressive effects of both propofol and midazolam on consciousness are synergistic with opioids, but the nature of their interactions on other physiological systems, e.g. respiration, has not been fully investigated. The present study examined the effect of propofol and midazolam alone and in combination with fentanyl on phrenic nerve activity (PNA) and whether such interactions are additive or synergistic.", 
    "130": "PNA was recorded in 27 anaesthetised and artificially ventilated rabbits. In three groups, propofol, fentanyl and midazolam were administered intravenously in incremental doses to construct dose-response curves for the depressant effects of each one on PNA. In another two groups, the effect of pretreatment with either fentanyl 1 microgram.kg-1 i.v. or midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 i.v. on the effects of propofol and fentanyl respectively on PNA were studied.", 
    "131": "Propofol and fentanyl caused a dose-dependent depression of PNA with complete abolition at the highest total doses of 16 mg.kg-1 i.v. and 32 micrograms.kg-1 i.v., respectively. In contrast, midazolam in incremental doses to a total of 0.8 mg.kg-1 reduced mean PNA by 63%, but approximately 12% of PNA remained at a total dose as high as 6.4 mg.kg-1. The mean ED50s, calculated from dose-response curves, were 5.4 mg.kg-1, 3.9 micrograms.kg-1 and 0.4 mg.kg-1 for propofol, fentanyl and midazolam, respectively. Initial doses of either fentanyl 1 microgram.kg-1 i.v. or midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 i.v. acted synergistically with subsequent doses of either propofol or fentanyl to abolish PNA at total doses of 8 mg.kg-1 and 8 micrograms.kg-1, respectively.", 
    "132": "Fentanyl has a synergistic interaction with both propofol and midazolam on PNA and hence potentially on respiration.", 
    "133": "Isoflurane has exceeded halothane and enflurane in usage. A literature search, however, revealed no data comparing the effects on emesis, headache and restlessness of these three agents.", 
    "134": "With hospital ethics committee approval and patient consent, a prospective, randomised, double-blind study of 556 patients undergoing ENT and eye surgery was undertaken to evaluate the effects of halothane, isoflurane and enflurane on vomiting, retching, headache and restlessness until 24 h after anaesthesia. Balanced general anaesthesia was administered comprising benzodiazepine premedication, induction with thiopentone-atracurium-morphine (ENT patients) or fentanyl (eye patients), controlled ventilation and maintenance with either halothane 0.4-0.6 vol% (n = 186), isoflurane 0.6-0.8 vol% (n = 184) or enflurane 0.8-1 vol% (n = 186) in nitrous oxide 67% and oxygen.", 
    "135": "The three study groups were comparable, and comprised comparable subgroups having ear, nose, throat, intraocular and non-intraocular surgery. During early recovery from anaesthesia, the respective requirements for halothane, isoflurane and enflurane for analgesia (7%, 9% and 10%), frequency of emesis (6%, 8% and 8%), antiemetic requirements (1%, 1% and 2%), restlessness-pain scores and time spent in the recovery ward (27 SD 10, 31 SD 12 and 26 SD 9 min) were similar. During the ensuing 24-h postoperative period, patients who had isoflurane experienced emesis less often than those who had halothane (36% vs 46%, P < 0.025) but did so with similar frequency to those who had enflurane (46% vs 41%). Antiemetic requirements were least in those given isoflurane (isoflurane 12%, halothane and enflurane 23% each, P < 0.005), but headache and analgesic requirements were similar.", 
    "136": "Isoflurane induces less postoperative emesis than halothane, but headache is similarly frequent after anaesthesia with any of these agents.", 
    "137": "Rifabutin pharmacokinetics were studied by the population approach (NONMEM) with 40 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients receiving rifabutin at different doses for prophylaxis or therapy of mycobacterial infections. A two-compartment open model with first-order absorption was used as the structural pharmacokinetic model. Parameter estimates were the absorption rate constant (0. 201/h), clearance/bioavailability (CL/F; 60.9 liters/h), volume of the central compartment/bioavailability (231 liters), intercompartmental clearance (60.3 liters/h), and volume of the peripheral compartment/bioavailability (Vp/F; 1,050 liters). The distribution and elimination half-lives were 1.24 and 25.4 h, respectively. The covariates tested for influence on CL/F and Vp/F were sex, age, weight, height, body surface area, tobacco smoking, drug addiction, alanine aminotransferase levels, creatinine clearance, total protein, bilirubin, numbers of CD4(+) cells, presence of diarrhea, cachexia index, rifabutin use (prophylaxis versus therapy), rifabutin dose, study site, and the concomitant administration of clarithromycin, fluconazole, phenobarbital, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, or benzodiazepines. The only statistically significant effects on rifabutin pharmacokinetic parameters were a 27% decrease in Vp/F due to the concomitant administration of azithromycin and a 39% increase in Vp/F due to tobacco smoking. Such effects may be considered clinically unimportant. Our results confirm the lack of a correlation of rifabutin pharmacokinetic parameters with parameters of disease progression and gastrointestinal function. Also, the lack of a correlation with covariates which were previously found to be significant, such as concomitant fluconazole and clarithromycin use, may suggest that the effect of such covariates may be less important in the real clinical setting, in which several concomitant factors may influence pharmacokinetic parameters, with an overall effect of no apparent correlation.", 
    "138": "Amperozide, clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone are more potent serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)2A receptor antagonists than dopamine D2-like receptor antagonists. Haloperidol and S(-)-sulpiride are potent or selective dopamine D2-like receptor antagonists and lack 5-HT2A receptor antagonist properties. We studied the effect of these five proven antipsychotic drugs and one putative (amperozide) antipsychotic drug on extracellular 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens of awake, freely-moving rats, using in vivo microdialysis with dual probe implantation. Risperidone (1 mg/kg) and clozapine (20 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens, respectively. Amperozide (2 and 10 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels in both regions. Olanzapine (1 and 10 mg/kg), S(-)-sulpiride (10 and 25 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) and the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL-100,907 (1 mg/kg) had no significant effect on extracellular 5-HT levels in either region. Thus, the ability to increase extracellular 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens by these antipsychotic drugs is not directly related to their affinity for 5-HT2A receptors since olanzapine and MDL-100,907 had no significant effect on extracellular 5-HT levels. A variety of mechanisms other than those involving 5-HT2A receptors, e.g., reuptake inhibition (amperozide) and blockade of alpha2-adrenoceptors (clozapine), may contribute to the ability to increase extracellular 5-HT levels in the brain. The increase in extracellular 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex or nucleus accumbens following amperozide, clozapine, or risperidone administration may not be related to the effect on psychotic symptoms but could be related to effects on other types of psychopathology such as depression, negative symptoms, or cognition.", 
    "139": "A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the quantification of midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam in human plasma. Sample (1 ml plasma) preparation involved a simple solvent extraction step with a recovery of approximately 90% for both compounds. An aliquot of the dissolved residue was injected onto a 3 microm capillary C18 column (150 mm x 0.8 mm I.D.). A gradient elution was used. The initial mobile phase composition (phosphate buffer-acetonitrile, 65:35) was maintained during 16 min and was then changed linearly during a 1-min period to phosphate buffer-acetonitrile, 40:60. The flow-rate of the mobile phase was 16 microl/min and the eluate was monitored by UV detection. The limits of quantification for midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were 1 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml, respectively. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by studying the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, and its major metabolite 1'-hydroxymidazolam, in human volunteers following i.v. bolus administration of a subtherapeutic midazolam dose (40 microg/kg)."
