    "0": "1. Dose levels of mephenesin, methocarbamol, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam which abolished polysynaptic reflex contractions had no effect on monosynaptic knee-jerk reflexes in chloralose anaesthetized cats.2. Ventral root potentials were recorded following stimulation of the corresponding dorsal root (L7 or S1), and the areas of the mono- and polysynaptic components were measured by planimetry.3. Dose levels of the drugs which abolished polysynaptic reflex contractions reduced the areas of the polysynaptic component of the ventral root potentials by about 50%. Mephenesin and methocarbamol reduced the area of the monosynaptic component to a similar extent. Chlordiazepoxide was less potent in this respect while diazepam was without effect at this dose level.4. Linear regression lines were calculated for the reduction in the mono- and polysynaptic components of ventral root potentials with increasing doses of each of the four drugs. With methocarbamol and mephenesin the lines were parallel and coincident. With chlordiazepoxide and diazepam they were parallel but not coincident. Large doses of diazepam were required to reduce the area of the monosynaptic component, this drug being the only one of the four tested to have a differential action on the two components which was statistically significant.5. The results are discussed in terms of depressant actions of the drugs on alpha-motorneurones, effects of the drugs at higher centres concerned with motor function, and the lack of evidence that spinal interneurones represent a specific site of action for centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants."
