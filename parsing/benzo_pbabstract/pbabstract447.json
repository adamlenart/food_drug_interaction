    "0": "A muscarinic receptor subtype 1 (M1) antagonist, pirenzepine, recently has been shown to be relatively free of the usual anticholinergic side effects on esophageal smooth muscle and thus has been implicated for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the effect of pirenzepine on GERD remains to be defined. Thirteen patients who demonstrated GERD in a baseline 24-hr ambulatory intraesophageal pH monitoring study were randomized in a double-blind crossover fashion to receive pirenzepine and placebo. An ambulatory 24-hr intraesophageal pH monitor was used to assess reduction in reflux (esophageal pH less than 4.0) with respect to position (upright vs supine), to total number of reflux episodes, and to episodes greater than 5 min. A significant effect for pirenzepine was seen for episodes greater than 5 min (t = 2.61, P = 0.023) and a trend towards significance was seen for total (upright and supine positions combined) percent time of reflux (t = 2.13, P = 0.055). Although not statistically significant, pirenzepine consistently showed greater reduction in all parameters of reflux tested. A greater reduction in percent time of reflux in supine vs upright positions (pirenzepine: 58.9% vs 21.4%; placebo: 43.6% vs 7.3%) may be clinically important in prevention of esophageal injury due to reflux in the recumbent position. Pirenzepine may provide a unique alternative for some GERD patients who may be refractory to other therapies of GERD.", 
    "1": "We investigated a hormonal mechanism in a trypsin inhibitor-induced pancreatic hypersecretion in rats. Intraduodenal administration of a synthetic trypsin inhibitor, camostat, resulted in significant increases in plasma concentration of both secretin and cholecystokinin in a dose-related manner that paralleled a significant increase in exocrine pancreatic secretion. To eliminate the effect of circulating secretin in rats, a rabbit antisecretin serum was given IV that resulted in a 77% reduction in bicarbonate secretion stimulated by intraduodenal camostat. A cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, MK-329, also inhibited significantly the camostat-induced increase in pancreatic secretion; volume and bicarbonate output were reduced by 35% each and amylase output by 73%. The combined administration of antisecretin serum and MK-329 completely abolished the pancreatic exocrine secretion stimulated by camostat. These observations indicate that the camostat-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion is mediated by the increased release of both secretin and cholecystokinin in rats.", 
    "2": "A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial in 11 healthy male volunteers compared clinical sedation and psychomotor function after intravenous injection of midazolam (0.05, 0.1, or 0.15 mg/kg), diazepam (0.15 or 0.3 mg/kg), or placebo (saline). The depth of sedation was estimated at 5-10-min intervals during the first hour after injection. A comprehensive battery of psychomotor tests was used to collect objective data of psychomotor performance before drug injection and 1, 3, 5, and 7 h after injection. Midazolam (0.15 mg/kg) produced the highest scores of sedation and most impairment of psychomotor performance. In most tests, the maximal psychomotor effects seen after 0.3 mg/kg of diazepam did not reach those of 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam. Although the strongest psychomotor effects were induced by midazolam, these effects disappeared sooner than those of diazepam. By 5 h after injection, 0.3 mg/kg of diazepam showed the highest scores of psychomotor impairment. The authors conclude that at least four times as much diazepam as midazolam is needed to produce equally severe psychomotor impairment. That the residual effects of midazolam terminate sooner than those of diazepam probably accounts for the occasional underestimation of the potency of midazolam in clinical practice.", 
    "3": "To determine whether the risk of midazolam-induced ventilatory depression is related to the rate of midazolam administration, we compared the effect of rapid (over 15 s) and slow (over 5 min) administration of midazolam (0.1 mg/kg IV) on the hypercarbic ventilatory response of 10 healthy volunteers. During the first 5 min after the start of midazolam injection, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 was significantly lower when the subjects received midazolam rapidly (P less than 0.001). However, after completion of the infusion (between 5 and 20 min), depression of the CO2 response curve slope was independent of the rate of midazolam administration. Similarly, although minute ventilation and tidal volume measured at an end-tidal CO2 tension of approximately 46 mm Hg decreased more quickly after rapid administration of midazolam (P less than 0.001), these variables did not differ significantly between the two rates of administration once the slow infusion was complete. These results suggest that slow administration of midazolam provides no independent protection from respiratory depression.", 
    "4": "Drug abuse during pregnancy in rural populations has received less attention than that in urban populations. Urban studies have reported alarming rates, but it is unknown whether the situation is the same in rural areas. To investigate this, urine samples were collected anonymously from 181 pregnant women who presented to the University of Missouri clinics for care and who resided in communities of less than 25,000. Each urine specimen was tested for cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, ethanol, and nicotine. Of the 181 specimens, 83 (46%) contained nicotine, 17 (9.4%) contained marijuana, and one each (0.6%) tested positive for cocaine, barbiturates, ethanol, and benzodiazepines. No other tested substances were detected. Excluding nicotine and ethanol, 20 (11%) of the urine samples tested positive for the screened substances. Review of the prenatal records revealed that 46% of the women reported using tobacco, 15% reported using alcohol, and 8.3% reported illicit drug use during pregnancy. This study indicates that there is a substantial drug abuse problem in rural populations, and that the profile of abuse differs from that of urban populations. Tobacco, ethanol, and marijuana were the most prevalent substances abused during pregnancy, but cocaine was a minor problem. This information may help in directing resources to reduce drug abuse during pregnancy.", 
    "5": "The influx of 36Cl- into cerebral cortical and cerebellar microsacs from ICR mice and Sprague-Dawley rats was studied in incubations lasting 3 s, 500 ms, or 21 ms. In the 3-s assay, 10-40 mM ethanol did not affect either basal or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- flux, at any GABA concentration tested. Only at a concentration of 600 mM did ethanol potentiate Cl- flux in both mouse and rat preparations. Ethanol (20 mM) also did not affect the significant potentiation of GABA-mediated flux produced by 50 microM pentobarbital or 2 microM diazepam in ICR mouse microsacs. In 21- and 500-ms incubations (quench-flow method), 50 microM pentobarbital significantly potentiated GABA-mediated Cl- flux in rat cortical microsacs, but 10-50 mM ethanol did not. These studies suggest that some as yet unrecognized factor is essential for ethanol enhancement of GABA-mediated Cl- flux, as reported by others in brain homogenates and in tissue culture.", 
    "6": "The presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptor of Torpedo marmorata electric organ has been characterised by radioligand binding studies using the subtype-selective antagonists pirenzepine, (+)-telenzepine, methoctramine, and AF-DX 116. The presynaptic receptor had relatively high affinity for the M1 antagonists pirenzepine and (+)-telenzepine (Ki = 35 and 7 nM, respectively) and lower affinities for the M2 antagonists AF-DX 116 and methoctramine (Ki = 311 and 277 nM, respectively). Comparison of these binding data with those from an M2 receptor (rat heart membranes) assayed under identical conditions and with data in the recent literature suggests that the Torpedo muscarinic autoreceptor has a pharmacology most similar to the M1 pharmacological subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.", 
    "7": "The receptor pharmacology of the human sweat gland was studied in vivo. The axon-reflex response was mediated by nicotinic receptors which were activated by nicotine and acetylcholine, but not pilocarpine, and inhibited by hexamethonium. The direct response was mainly muscarinic, responding to pilocarpine and acetylcholine. A component of the direct response was nicotinic, since it was activated by nicotine and blocked by hexamethonium in a dose-dependent manner. The axon-reflex response to nicotine and acetylcholine was partially blocked by pilocarpine, especially when application of pilocarpine preceded the procedure. The inhibition of the nicotinic response may be secondary to M1 antagonism since pilocarpine is an M2 agonist and M1 antagonist and pirenzepine, a specific M1 antagonist, caused similar effects as pilocarpine.", 
    "8": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of action of alprazolam on concanavalin A (Con A)-induced murine T-cell proliferation. Splenic cells of BALB/c mice were first cultured with an optimum dose of Con A in the presence or absence of varying doses of alprazolam to assess effects of alprazolam on T-cell proliferation, interleukin 2 (IL2) production and IL2 receptor (IL2R) expression. Then, Con A-induced T-blast cells from BALB/c mice were cultured with an excess dose of human recombinant IL2 (rIL2) or crude rat IL2 supernate in the presence or absence of alprazolam to assess the effects of alprazolam on the interaction of IL2 and IL2R. The results of these studies clearly demonstrated that alprazolam can inhibit the T-cell proliferation in response to Con A but not to IL2. Alprazolam also reduced the production of IL2 by splenic T-cells, but did not alter the expression of IL2R on Con A-induced T-blast cells. Furthermore, the results also showed that (a) alprazolam did not inhibit the proliferative response of splenic T-cells to a combination of phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, and (b) the addition of exogenous IL2 reversed the inhibitory effect of alprazolam on T-cell proliferation. Finally, the addition of alprazolam produced a time-dependent inhibiting effect on T-cell proliferation. However, this inhibitory effect of alprazolam was abolished when the drug was added to the cultures of competent cells that fully expressed IL2R. Taken together, these results suggest that alprazolam inhibits murine T-cell proliferation by affecting the mitogenic receptor-mediated events (initiation) rather than the IL2R-mediated events (progression) of ligand-activated T-cells through the cell cycle.", 
    "9": "The effects of diazepam and D-amphetamine on spontaneous, vestibular- and visually-induced eye movements were studied in the restrained goldfish. These animals showed a stereotyped pattern of spontaneous eye movements that scanned the visual field in the horizontal plane. Fourier analysis of these eye movements revealed a rhythmic pattern of about 5 cycles per minute, whose frequency increased to double and decreased to half following treatment with diazepam and D-amphetamine, respectively. However, the fast and slow components of vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes, as well as peculiar blink-like movements, remained unchanged at the same drug doses. These results suggest the presence of a central pattern generator for spontaneous eye movements in the goldfish, whose oscillation frequency is pharmacologically modifiable.", 
    "10": "Advances in neuropeptide neurobiology in the last decade are illustrated by studies of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), the 41 amino acid-containing peptide that controls the anterior pituitary secretion of adrenocorticotropin and other pro-opiomelanocortin products. Corticotropin-releasing factor is synthesized in both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic perikarya in a large prohormone form, (186 amino acids), then it is processed and transported to nerve terminals where it is released in its active form by a calcium-dependent mechanism. Corticotropin-releasing factor biosynthesis can now be measured by in situ hybridization because of the elucidation of the CRF gene sequence. Once released, CRF acts on high-affinity CRF receptors, and signal transduction is mediated by activation of adenylate cyclase in certain brain areas, and perhaps by phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In other brain areas CRF is inactivated by peptidases that degrade the hormone, though these are not well characterized. A CRF binding protein has been identified in plasma, and perhaps in brain. Considerable evidence exists from cerebrospinal fluid studies, postmortem tissue receptor measurements, and CRF stimulation test studies to support the hypothesis that CRF is hypersecreted in depression, resulting in both pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity and certain signs and symptoms of depression, e.g., decreased libido, insomnia, and decreased appetite. There is also evidence for an involvement of CRF in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and in the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. The development of selective CRF-receptor antagonists will permit direct testing of the hypothesis that CRF hypersecretion is responsible for certain of the cardinal features of affective and anxiety disorders.", 
    "11": "The effect of oral premedication was studied in a double-blind, randomised trial of 200 children undergoing day-stay anaesthesia. Midazolam 0.25 mg/kg, midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, diazepam 0.5 mg/kg or a placebo was given orally one hour prior to anaesthesia. Patient state was assessed at nine stages, from administration of the premedication up to and including induction of anaesthesia, using a four-point behavioural scale. Patient state was also assessed postoperatively in the recovery area and the day-stay ward. There was no difference between the four groups until induction of anaesthesia. At this stage 82% of children were either asleep or awake and calm. Patients who received midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were more likely to be asleep or awake and calm at induction rather than other groups (P = 0.05). Children receiving midazolam 0.5 mg/kg or diazepam 0.5 mg/kg slept longest in the post anaesthetic recovery room (P less than 0.005), and spent most time there (P less than .005). There was no difference between groups in the length of time spent in the day-stay ward or in the number of overnight admissions. The study shows that a high proportion of unsedated children are calm at induction of anaesthesia and that oral midazolam is an effective premedication in children for day-stay anaesthesia.", 
    "12": "L-365,260 is a novel cholecystokinin receptor antagonist. A sensitive and specific liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric assay has been developed for the determination of the drug in plasma using the CD3-labeled species as the internal standard. Plasma extracts were separated on a 3 cm C18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column. The column eluate passed, by means of a heated nebulizer interface, into a corona discharge atmospheric chemical ionization source. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion tandem mass spectrometric mode. The method has sufficient sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy and selectivity for the determination of drug concentrations in clinical samples. The chromatographic run time is less than 2 min.", 
    "13": "A neurological and electroencephalographic (EEG) prospective study was performed in 34 leukemic patients receiving busulfan (BU) plus cyclophosphamide (CY) before bone marrow autologous transplant. During BU treatment and briefly thereafter, all patients were given anticonvulsant prophylaxis with phenobarbital. Neurological evaluations were performed daily and EEGs, recorded one week before and soon after the end of the BU regimen, were re-evaluated two months later. Basal EEGs were normal in 23 of the 34 patients, focal abnormalities were detected in 9 cases, and generalized epileptic discharges were present in one (one subject was not studied). EEGs performed at the end of BU administration showed generalized spike/polyspike-and-wave discharges in 21 of the 34 patients, with associated myoclonic epilepsy in 10 subjects appearing on the 3rd or 4th day of treatment. Focal abnormalities were present in 6 patients and constant EEG normality in 7. It is known that myoclonic epilepsy can be induced by drugs. Oral administration of high-dose BU is followed by a high-dose cerebrospinal fluid concentration of the drug. Therefore, myoclonic epilepsy and/or paroxysmal epileptiform EEG discharges may be observed in leukemic patients undergoing high-dose BU therapy.", 
    "14": "Cinolazepam is reduced at the Dropping Mercury Electrode (DME) over the entire pH range in Britton Robinson buffers (BRB) containing 20% DMF as a solubilizer. A well-defined cathodic wave is obtained over the pH range 3-5, which is very suitable for analytical purposes. The wave was characterized as being irreversible, diffusion-controlled and free from adsorption phenomena. In acid buffers, 4 electrons are consumed in the reduction process, while in alkaline buffers the electrode reaction is somewhat complicated. Tablets containing 40 mg cinolazepam were analysed using the polarographic and a developed HPLC method. The results obtained with both methods are in good accordance as revealed by statistical analysis. The details of the complicated mechanism of the reduction process at the DME are still under investigation but elucidated in principle.", 
    "15": "PK 11195 is a selective ligand for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site (PTBBS). There are few such sites in normal brain but their number increases in association with tissue necrosis. The time-course of appearance of PTBBS around a focally induced ischaemic lesion in frontal cortex of rat brain was established by autoradiography using [N-methyl-3H]PK 11195. Using this information and the same experimental model of ischaemia, the distribution of radioactivity after injection of carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20.3 min, beta+ = 99.8%) labelled PK 11195 was studied. The purpose was to synthesize [N-methyl-11C]PK 11195 and to test its suitability as a tracer for depicting the presence of PTBBS in ischaemic lesions. The time-profiles of distribution of radioactivity in brain regions after intravenous injection of tracer and the ratio of radioactivity in lesioned compared with unlesioned cortex were determined. Data for the temporal (days after lesion induction) and for the regional retention of radioactivity were consistent with independent evidence (autoradiographic and immunohistochemical) for the occurrence of increased numbers of PTBBS, predominantly in association with macrophages, in areas undergoing necrosis.", 
    "16": "Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats rendered epileptic by bilateral cerebral implantation of cobalt wire were simultaneously prepared with permanent cortical and temporalis muscle electrodes for continuous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activities. Clonazepam (4, 10 or 40 mg/kg) dissolved in gum acacia was administered once daily intraperitoneally for 5 days beginning 9 days after cobalt implantation. The 40 mg/kg dose completely suppressed generalized seizure activity. Although no tolerance to this effect developed by the fifth day of treatment, generalized seizure activity two days after the last injection was significantly greater in epileptic rats than in control animals. These results suggest that the cobalt model of epilepsy may be useful in the study of mechanisms underlying both anticonvulsant effectiveness and rebound excitability after anticonvulsant drug withdrawal.", 
    "17": "Kynurenine is a direct precursor of kynurenic acid, the only known endogenous antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors in the brain. Kynurenine administered intraperitoneally (150, 450, 900 mg/kg) 2 h before pentylenetetrazol injection dose-dependently increased the time to seizures, the time to death and the survivorship of mice. Kynurenine dose-dependently increased the time to seizures and the time to death in mice with NMDLA-induced seizures. Kynurenine, 900 mg/kg, was equally efficacious to diazepam, 2 mg/kg. Probenecid dose-dependently increased the time to seizures, the time to death and the survivorship of mice with pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Probenecid had no significant effects on NMDLA-induced seizures, although the time to death was prolonged in the NMDLA 500 mg/kg group. Probenecid potentiated the effects of kynurenine in these tests. Both probenecid and kynurenine significantly increased kynurenine and kynurenic acid concentrations in mouse cerebral cortex and striatum. These findings suggest that kynurenine (metabolized to kynurenic acid) has anticonvulsant effects, and probenecid potentiates these effects in mice.", 
    "18": "Midazolam (Dormicum Roche) was administered to 40 patients aged 68 +/- 11 years (5 mg by the i.v. route), along with phentanyl and droperidol before primo-implantation or replacement of pacemaker under local anaesthesia. Another 5 mg were administered at the end of the operation before the final skin suture. In all patients a favourable sedative effect was achieved with rapid regression after the operation was completed, in the majority with retrograde amnesia. None of the patients developed respiratory arrest or mental alteration during the postoperative period, while in an equal number of patients in the control group both complications occurred three times.", 
    "19": "A cluster sampling survey among 4139 subjects was carried out to detect present trend of drug abuse of medical professionals. Higher prevalence rate (2.3%) was found compared with local residents in previous survey by the same authors. The drug of abuse of those positive cases are of the sedative-hypnotic type and benzodiazepine abused most predominantly. PSE, EPQ, reactive features of life events and SDSS were assessed to explore the clinical characteristics of the addicted cases. Adopting Logistic regression with interactive plus stepwise mode, risk factors were analysed. It was clearly revealed that all positive cases do coincide with the rule of iatrogenic drug dependency.", 
    "20": "Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium ion (MPP+) into the lateral ventricle of mice induced clonic convulsions and lethality in a dose- and age-dependent manner. MPP+ failed to induce seizures in 4-day-old mice, and the convulsant response to MPP+ was enhanced in aged mice. The seizures triggered by MPP+ in adult mice were blocked by coadministration of L-glutamate antagonists active at kainate/AMPA receptors such as gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulphonate and 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, but not kynurenate, also protected mice against MPP+ convulsions. Similarly, the benzodiazepine midazolam and the adenosine A1 agonist 2-chloroadenosine, but not antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, trimethadione, ethosuximide, or acetazolamide, showed a protective efficacy against seizures. Additionally, the excitatory amino acid antagonists as well as phenobarbital, midazolam and 2-chloroadenosine protected mice against MPP+ lethality. These data suggest that convulsant action of MPP+ and its lethality in rodents may be mediated by excitatory amino acids.", 
    "21": "Medications with central nervous system (CNS) effects, including benzodiazepines, cyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, narcotic analgesics, and hypoglycemics, have been thought to have the potential to impair driving. These drugs impair performance in younger drivers and some have been linked to an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes. Even though persons 65 years of age and older frequently take these drugs and are more susceptible to CNS effects, no direct data exist regarding whether or not medications adversely affect driving safety in this population. Thus there is an urgent need for further research in this area.", 
    "22": "Brain-injured patients involved in rehabilitation programs are susceptible to the occurrence of acute seizures or severe behavioral episodes. Effective pharmacological management in this setting should ideally include rapid onset without severe adverse effects. Previous treatments have generally included intramuscular diazepam or lorazepam, as well as intramuscular antipsychotic drugs. These options have proved problematic due to poor absorption, slow onset of activity, or potential for unacceptable side effects. We report 10 cases involving the use of intramuscular midazolam, a rapid-acting, short half-life benzodiazepine, in treating acute seizures or behavioral problems. We conclude that this drug demonstrates great promise for the rapid, effective treatment of these conditions without significant adverse effects and deserves further study in these areas.", 
    "23": "Drug use was examined in a French general population adult sample from a household survey conducted in 1987-8 in a newly built town near Paris. Psychotropic drug use was measured by the percentage of subjects reporting their use during the past week. It was prominently represented by benzodiazepines (90% of psychotropic users), differed strongly between genders (4.6% in men, 10.2% in women) and age groups (higher after 40 years). A lifetime history of major depressive episode (MDE) or of anxiety disorders was associated with a higher proportion of psychotropic drug use. Psychotropic drug use also went with a current well-being questionnaire score. Using a logistic analysis, the following set of variables held for women: well-being score, history of both MDE and anxiety disorder, age, and marital status. Making allowance for the cross-sectional nature of this retrospective survey, these finding confirmed the relatively high level of benzodiazepine drug use in an urban French community sample and emphasized its association with mental health status.", 
    "24": "To investigate the relationship between anxiety and parasympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac vagal tone was assessed in six healthy volunteers after the intravenous administration of the anxiolytic diazepam. Vagal tone was determined by quantifying the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia. We observed a significant dose-dependent attenuation in vagal tone, accompanied by an increase in heart rate. There was a nonstatistically significant decrease in plasma norepinephrine concentrations and subjective anxiety ratings at higher doses of diazepam. We discuss a possible role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "25": "The ability of Ro15-4513, an imidazobenzodiazepine inverse benzodiazepine agonist, to attenuate/block the acquisition of an ethanol (ETOH)-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) was investigated in two experiments. Experiment 1 examined the effects of Ro15-4513 (3 mg/kg) on rats' consumption of a novel saccharin solution under a traditional CTA paradigm. Experiment 2 examined the effects of Ro15-4513 (3 mg/kg) on rats' consumption of a novel saccharin solution under a preexposure CTA paradigm. Under the preexposure paradigm, rats were given Ro15-4513 immediately before each of five daily consecutive preexposure treatments prior to the initial conditioning day. To obtain maximal preexposure and unconditioned stimulus effects, a 2-g/kg dose of ETOH (20% v/v) was used in the present study. As previously reported, animals given ETOH following 20-min access to a novel saccharin solution established moderate to strong aversions, with the degree of aversion being directly related to the number of conditioning days. Experiment 1 showed that Ro15-4513 failed to alter the CTA induced by ETOH. Experiment 2 further showed that Ro15-4513 failed to block the preexposure effect exerted on the ETOH-mediated CTA. The results confirm previous reports regarding the failure of Ro15-4513 to disrupt an ETOH-induced CTA. These data are in agreement with a number of behavioral studies demonstrating the failure of Ro15-4513 to antagonize certain actions of ETOH. Moreover, the present study along with a previous report suggests that ETOH-induced CTA's do not appear to be mediated via actions at the GABA-BDZ receptor complex.", 
    "26": "The present study was undertaken to examine how the triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, alprazolam, which possesses anxiolytic activity in man and anticonflict effects in animals, could affect both the duration of immobility and the incidence of straw-climbing behavior of rats in a modified forced-swim (MFS) test. After a 5-min test of forced swimming, four straws were suspended just above the surface of the water and subsequently the straw-climbing trials were counted for 5 min as an index of escape behaviors induced by negative emotionality (anxiety and/or fear). Rats were injected IP with either alprazolam (0.1, 0.2, 1, and 2 mg/kg) or its vehicle 30 min before testing. Alprazolam prolonged the duration of immobility and inhibited the straw-climbing counts in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is in the same direction as the effect shown by an anxiolytic benzodiazepine such as diazepam. The results suggest that alprazolam may possess anxiolytic effects at lower doses, whereas at a high dose of 2 mg/kg this compound might elicit sedation, concomitantly with its anxiolytic and/or antipanic effects. In addition, it appears that alprazolam is more potent than diazepam in the MFS test following a single-injection protocol.", 
    "27": "Hypothermia and motor impairment (tilt-plane) tests were used to assess the phenomenon of rapid tolerance to ethanol and cross-tolerance to various alcohols, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates that differ in lipid:water partition coefficients. The hypothermic and motor impairment responses to ethanol were significantly reduced on day 2 in rats receiving ethanol (2 doses of 2 g/kg each for the hypothermia test and 2.3 and 1.7 g/kg for the tilt-plane test) 24 and 22 h earlier compared to the control group pretreated with saline. Ethanol pretreatment resulted in rapid cross-tolerance, on both tests, to the various alcohols (n-propanol, n-butanol, and t-butanol) and the benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, and flurazepam) tested. Ethanol pretreatment also conferred clear rapid cross-tolerance to barbital and phenobarbital, but did not result in rapid cross-tolerance to pentobarbital, secobarbital, amobarbital, or thiopental. The results on rapid cross-tolerance on both tests seen in these studies parallel the results obtained in chronic tolerance and cross-tolerance studies reported recently. These results suggest that rapid tolerance and cross-tolerance can be used as predictors of chronic tolerance and cross-tolerance.", 
    "28": "There is a wealth of evidence that more psychotropic drugs are prescribed to female than to male patients. We studied the psychotropic drug prescription of 15 male and 9 female physicians to 2493 patients in the Ambulatory Care Clinic of a University hospital. The relative odds (RO) of benzodiazepine prescription to a female compared to a male patient was the same when the physician was a male or a female (adjusted RO: 1.8; 95% CL: 1.5-2.1). But female patients were significantly more likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs of all types from a female than from a male physician (adjusted RO: 1.3; 95% CL: 1.0-1.7). Information on patient diagnosis or on severity of symptoms would be needed to determine whether the present results reflect gender differences in medical care needs, overprescription of psychotropic drugs to females or underprescription of psychotropic drugs to males.", 
    "29": "A pathologically increased muscle tone is frequently observed. Objective methods for measuring directly the muscle-relaxant action of drugs in laboratory animals are scarce. This study shows that a computerized mechanomyographic method allows the assessment of myorelaxant drugs. The method consists of the successive bending and straightening of the rat's foot in the ankle joint and the separate measurement of resistance of extensors and flexors of the hind foot to passive movements. The two well-known antispastic drugs diazepam and baclofen reduced the normal muscle tone in both groups of muscles in non-treated animals as well as the muscle tone increased by reserpine (10 mg/kg i.p.). The results obtained show that the mechanomyographic method directly and reliably reveals the myorelaxant action of drugs.", 
    "30": "\"Automated fluctuation analysis\" of human scalp EEG was made in order to evaluate anaesthetic effect of intravenous diazepam injection. Seven patients without disturbed consciousness were utilized for this study. Analytical system is composed of high fidelity pre-amplifier and signal processor. After 10,000 amplification of the signal, A/D conversion and Fast Fourier Transform were programmed with following parameters, sweep time; 12 sec., frequency resolvability; 1.2 Hz, frequency limit; 1 kHz, Fourier points; 2048 and Fourier time; 15. Power spectral density (PSD) was displayed on log-log graph. The best curve fitting program was next applied to the following equation, S(f) = S1/[1 + (f/fcl)2]+S2/[1 + (f/fc2)2] S(f): power spectral density, S1,S2: plateau levels of the initial and the second Lorentz, fcl, fc2: the corner or half power frequencies of the initial and the second Lorentz). As results, 1) PSDs of high frequency EEG up to 1 kHz were composed of double Lorentzian fluctuations. 2) From our previous animal study, it is suggested that the initial and the second Lorentz reflect the cortical and subcortical functions, respectively. 3) After diazepam injection, the second Lorentz was suppressed according to the time and dose and disappeared when the subjects fell asleep, and reappeared when waked up. There was excellent correlation between the consciousness level and the second Lorentz. 4) The initial Lorentz reflected higher cortical function; the ability of calculation or language were reduced after diazepam injection, and the hyperfrontal activity of the initial Lorentz disappeared. These results may suggest that \"Automated Fluctuation Analysis\" of high frequency EEG may have a potential to develop a new field in clinical neuroelectrophysiology.", 
    "31": "Estimates of extravascular lung water volume (Qew) by use of the multiple indicator-dilution method with a hydrophilic indicator such as tritiated water, along with a vascular reference indicator, depend not only on tissue hydration but also on tissue perfusion. Separation of these effects might be facilitated if both hydrophilic and lipophilic indicators were used, with the assumption that the extravascular volume accessible to the lipophilic indicator would be independent of hydration. We found that in isolated perfused dog lung lobes the extravascular volume accessible to the lipophilic amine [14C]diazepam (Qed) was inversely proportional to the albumin concentration of the perfusate. This suggested that while the bolus was in the lungs, only a small fraction of the diazepam was in the aqueous phase of either lung tissue or perfusate. Changing the flow rate over a fairly wide range had little influence on the pattern of the tritiated water or [14C]diazepam effluent concentration curves when time was normalized to the lobar mean transit time. This suggests that the association of the diazepam with both the plasma albumin and the lipoid fraction of the tissue was in very rapid equilibrium on the time scale of a single pass through the lung lobe and that there was little barrier to its diffusion to and from the tissue. When the extravascular water volume was increased by either raising the hydrostatic pressure or instilling saline into the airways, both Qew and Qew/Qed increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The effects of cholinergic drugs on three different perceptual bisection tasks were studied in rats. Physostigmine (0.056-0.56 mg/kg), a reversible anticholinesterase, produced dose-dependent decrements in discriminability (A'), but did not affect the bisection point (BP) in visual duration, auditory duration, and auditory intensity bisection tasks. This finding is consistent with results previously obtained in an auditory duration bisection task with an irreversible anticholinesterase, diisopropyl phosphofluoridate. Scopolamine (0.075-0.422 mg/kg), a muscarinic cholinergic-receptor antagonist, produced dose-dependent decrements in both A' and BP in visual and auditory duration bisection tasks. The behavioral antagonism between physostigmine (0.56 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.075-0.237 mg/kg) was studied in the visual and auditory duration bisection tasks. The BP was not affected by physostigmine alone or in combination with scopolamine, except at the largest dose of scopolamine, which produced a reliable decrement in the BP. A', however, was equally decreased by physostigmine alone and all combinations of physostigmine and scopolamine. Pirenzepine (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg), a selective high-affinity M1 muscarinic antagonist, had no effect on A' or the BP in the duration bisection tasks, suggesting changes in perception produced by muscarinic antagonists do not involve the M1 receptor subtype. The similar drug effects in different sensory modalities (visual and auditory) and perceptual systems (subjective duration and loudness) suggest that cholinergic drugs may affect perceptual mechanisms responsible for sensory coding, such as the output of a neural generator.", 
    "33": "Devazepide, a potent CCK-A receptor antagonist, and L-365,260, a selective CCK-B receptor antagonist, have been introduced as pharmacologic tools for differentiating the physiologic roles of CCK-A and CCK-B receptor subtypes. In the present study, we tested the effects of devazepide and L-365,260, on morphine antinociception in rats using the thermal sensorimotor tail flick test. Both devazepide and L-365,260 significantly enhanced the antinociceptive action of morphine, but only in rats that had not been acclimated to the laboratory environment or habituated to investigator handling. When tested with fully acclimated animals, devazepide and L-365,260 had no effect whatsoever; they neither enhanced nor attenuated morphine-induced antinociception. These observations indicate that the effects of devazepide and L-365,260, CCK antagonists, on morphine antinociception appear to be dependent on the animal's response to a new environment or to the stress induced by an unaccustomed experimental paradigm.",

Seventy-five undergraduate students were evenly divided among one innocent and four guilty groups. Subjects in each of the guilty groups received either one of the drugs or a placebo prior to the administration of the GKT and after viewing a videotape that depicted a burglary as seen from the perspective of the burglar. The results showed that drug status had no influence on the outcome of the GKT. Innocent subjects who coincidentally obtained high scores on a recognition memory test covering details of the mock crime tended to obtain higher guilt scores on the GKT.",

Among drugs the most frequent severe intoxications occur with benzodiazepines and antidepressives; therefore, the toxicological risk of these substances are investigated in more detail. In children, accidental intoxications with household products are most frequent. In these cases special emphasis must be put on preventive measures. Plants only rarely lead to severe intoxications; however, if toxic symptoms do occur, the analysis of their causality and overall risk for the patient can be a difficult task and frequently requires the involvement of a plant specialist.", 
    "36": "Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam has been studied in three murine models of epilepsy: pentylenetetrazole- and N-methyl-D,L-aspartic acid-induced seizures and audiogenic-induced seizures in the DBA/2 strain. Tolerance occurred most rapidly in the pentylenetetrazole model but the development of tolerance could be reduced by increasing the dose interval. Tolerance to the protective effects of clobazam occurred more readily to the first tonic seizure than to the full tonic clonic seizure. The development of tolerance could not be attributed to smaller concentrations of clobazam in brain or to increasing concentrations of the metabolite. Although slower to develop, tolerance to clobazam did occur in the N-methyl-D,L-aspartate model. However, tolerance to the protection from the full tonic clonic seizure in DBA/2 mice could not be detected, even when the dose of clobazam was reduced to the smallest dose that acutely protected most of the mice. In contrast, the protection given by clobazam to the induction of the wild-run in DBA/2 mice, did exhibit tolerance. Studies on the mechanism of tolerance to the anticonvulsant activity of benzodiazepines must take account of the seizure model used and the dose and interval between doses.", 
    "37": "To investigate whether alprazolam (ALP) coprescription early in the imipramine (IMI) treatment of panic disorder would improve overall treatment response to IMI alone, 48 panic disorder patients were randomly assigned to receive either IMI plus placebo or IMI plus ALP for 4-6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of IMI plus placebo-ALP taper and 2 more weeks of IMI alone. Although patients in the IMI plus ALP group improved more quickly, significantly more patients in the IMI plus ALP group could not follow the taper schedule. The results suggest that studies employing other benzodiazepines or other ALP dosage or taper schedules would be required to demonstrate any benefit for the IMI plus early benzodiazepine cotreatment strategy over IMI alone in the routine pharmacologic management of panic disorder.", 
    "38": "The relationship between hypertension and emotional depression or anxiety has been long-argued. We assessed the efficacy of etizolam (an antianxiety drug) in 18 patients with essential hypertension accompanied with unspecified complaints. In the assessment of overall improvement, 4 patients (22.2%) were rated as markedly improved, 4 patients (22.2%) as moderately improved, 7 patients (38.9%) as slightly improved, 3 patients (16.7%) as unchanged, and none as worsened. Systolic and diastolic pressure decreased significantly in 13 patients (72.2%) and 10 patients (55.5%), respectively. Many subjective symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue and depression improved. No significant adverse reaction from drug was observed. These results allow us to conclude that etizolam is effective and safe for the treatment of essential hypertension accompanied with unspecified complaints.",

The control group (Group A, n = 50) received oral diazepam 0.15 mg/kg 120 min before surgery and Group B (n = 50) received oral clonidine 300 micrograms 120 min before surgery. Two hours after the premedication, there was significantly more sedation (P less than 0.05) and less subjective anxiety (P less than 0.05) in the clonidine group than in the control group. There was a significant fall in intraocular pressure (IOP) from 20 +/- 0.5 to 13 +/- 0.5 mmHg (P less than 0.05) and significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) (P less than 0.05) in the clonidine group as compared to the control group. Perioperatively, significantly more supplementation with i.v. diazepam was given in the control group than in the clonidine group (P less than 0.01). The incidence of intra-operative hypertension (P less than 0.01) and tachycardia (P less than 0.05) was significantly greater in the control group than in the clonidine group. A significantly larger number of patients in the clonidine group scored a Post-Anaesthesia Recovery (PAR) score of 10 as compared to the control group (P less than 0.01).

    "41": "Sleep and mood are clearly interrelated in major depression, as shown by the antidepressive effects of various experiments, such as total sleep deprivation, partial sleep deprivation, REM sleep deprivation, and temporal shifts of the sleep period. The prevailing hypotheses explaining these effects concern the antidepressant potency of the suppression of either REM sleep or non-REM sleep. This issue is discussed in the light of present knowledge of the kinetics of non-REM sleep intensity, REM sleep production, and their interaction. Recent findings have led us to suggest that the suppression of non-REM sleep intensity is the common pathway in the set of experimental data on the antidepressant effects of sleep manipulations.",

Healthy male volunteers were given single oral therapeutic doses of alprazolam (2 mg), chlordiazepoxide (25 mg), flunitrazepam (1 mg), lorazepam (3.75 mg), nitrazepam (5 mg), and triazolam (0.25 mg), after which urine was collected for the next 32 h. The EMIT method failed to detect the intake of flunitrazepam, lorazepam, and nitrazepam. FPIA did not detect the intake of chlordiazepoxide, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, and triazolam. Modification of the EMIT method to include enzymatic hydrolysis did not significantly alter the results obtained with this method. A modification of the FPIA method to include enzymatic hydrolysis and a lower cutoff value improved the results considerably, so that we reliably detected all studied substances but flunitrazepam. We conclude that (a) both EMIT and FPIA techniques, when used as intended by the manufacturers, are unreliable for the detection of intake of therapeutic doses of these benzodiazepines, and (b) the described modification of the FPIA should provide a much improved tool for detection of benzodiazepine intake.",

    "48": "To test the hypothesis that endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the small intestine by ingested food produces a satiating effect by acting at CCKA-receptors, we measured the effect of slow continuous intravenous infusions of three doses of MK-329, a potent and selective CCKA-antagonist, on food intake during 2.5-h tests in 13 Sprague-Dawley male rats after 1 h of food deprivation. MK-329 increased food intake significantly and the lowest dose tested (0.5 mg.kg-1.h-1) produced the most consistent effect on cumulative intake. Part of the increased food intake under these conditions was due to a decrease in the satiating effect of food ingested at the first meal on the postprandial intermeal interval. These results are consistent with, but do not prove, the hypothesis that the satiating effect of endogenous CCK released from the small intestine by ingested food is mediated by CCKA-receptors.", 
    "49": "To investigate a possible effect of cholinergic agonists on the renal glomerular function, fura-2 microfluorometric measurements of intracellular free calcium [( Ca2+]i) were performed on single intact glomeruli, single isolated parietal sheets of the Bowman's capsule and single parietal sheet-deprived glomeruli (PS-D glomerulus). Carbachol (10(-4) M), in the presence of 2 mM external calcium, induced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i characterized by a sharp initial peak followed by a sustained plateau in the whole glomerulus (delta [Ca2+]i = 177 +/- 13 and 70 +/- 7 nM, respectively; n = 21) and in the parietal sheet (418 +/- 30 and 111 +/- 13 nM, respectively; n = 21). In the PS-D glomerulus (n = 9), the response was less marked and included a barely visible peak (77 +/- 13 nM) and a relatively low plateau (49 +/- 11 nM). In the absence of external calcium, the peak phase was preserved in the three structures, indicating a calcium release from intracellular pools, whereas the plateau, due to the entry of external calcium, was suppressed. These effects were fully inhibited by 10(-4) M of either atropine or pirenzepine, demonstrating the muscarinic nature of the receptors. Dose-response curves showed that the parietal sheet was more sensitive to the physiological agonist (acetylcholine) than to carbachol. A still unexplained difference in sensitivity was noted between peak and plateau, respectively (half-maximal responses were 5 x 10(-6) vs. 5 x 10(-7) M for carbachol and 2 x 10(-7) vs. 3 x 10(-8) M for acetylcholine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "The five muscarinic receptors (m1-m5), although structurally closely related, can be distinguished pharmacologically by the use of subtype-selective ligands. Various tricyclic muscarinic antagonists, including the AF-DX derivative AQ-RA 741 and the alkaloid himbacine, for example, have been shown to display up to 200-fold higher affinities for m2 and m4 than for m5 receptors. On the other hand, antagonists such as sila-hexocyclium and the pirenzepine derivative UH-AH 37 exhibit lower affinities for m2 than for m5 and all other muscarinic receptors. To identify receptor epitopes that contribute to the subtype selectivities of these antagonists, we prepared a series of chimeric m2/m5 muscarinic receptors in which regions of the m5 receptor were systematically replaced with the homologous regions of the m2 receptor. AQ-RA 741, himbacine, and sila-hexocyclium bound to the various chimeric receptors, expressed in COS-7 cells, with affinity profiles indicative of multiple receptor domains contributing to the subtype selectivities of these antagonists. On the other hand, the higher affinity of UH-AH 37 for m5 than for m2 receptors appears to be largely dependent on a short stretch of 31 amino acids comprising most of transmembrane region VI and the third extracellular loop, a region that does not contribute to the subtype selectivity of AQ-RA 741 and himbacine. Our data indicate that different receptor epitopes are involved in conferring subtype selectivity on structurally different muscarinic antagonists.", 
    "51": "Various guidelines have been issued to doctors concerning the treatment of anxiety in primary care and particularly on the use of benzodiazepines. Little has been reported about how this advice has influenced doctors' opinions and practice. This paper describes results of interviews with 15 general practitioners and 15 general practitioner trainees on their management of anxiety problems. Most respondents admitted prescribing benzodiazepines for anxiety but reported doing so only in cases of severe distress and for short periods of time. Trainees appeared more cautious in their use of benzodiazepines than the experienced practitioners. Most doctors agreed that counselling could be as effective as benzodiazepines in treating moderate anxiety but several respondents felt it too demanding of their time. Two-thirds of doctors were in favour of employing counsellors in general practice though many foresaw practical difficulties in doing so. Increased availability of clinical psychology services was the development which most respondents felt would improve their management of anxiety problems in primary care.", 
    "52": "The purported serotonin (5-HT)1A antagonists BMY-7378 and NAN-190 were examined in pigeons for their potential to block the effects of the prototypical 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on punished (\"conflict\") and unpunished behavior and for their binding affinity at the 5-HT1A receptor site labeled by [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. Although BMY-7378 and NAN-190 both displayed high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (IC50 values of 0.8 and 7.5 nM, respectively), their effects, when administered alone, as well as in combination with 8-OH-DPAT, were distinct. 8-OH-DPAT (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) produced large increases in punished responding at doses that did not affect or that decreased unpunished responding. Administration of NAN-190 (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) did not increase punished responding, whereas BMY-7378 (1.0-5.6 mg/kg) slightly increased behavior suppressed by punishment. Pretreatment with BMY-7378 attenuated the rate-increasing effects of 8-OH-DPAT on punished responding; however, these effects were accompanied by dose-dependent enhancement of the rate-decreasing effects of 8-OH-DPAT on unpunished responding. In contrast, NAN-190 blocked the rate-increasing effects of 8-OH-DPAT on punished responding and also reversed the rate-decreasing effects of 8-OH-DPAT on responding that was not punished. Pretreatment with NAN-190 failed to block increases in punished responding produced by 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg of the benzodiazepine midazolam. These data suggest that NAN-190 may be characterized as an antagonist and BMY-7378 a partial agonist with respect to 5-HT1A-induced behavioral changes observed in the conflict procedure with pigeons.",

This blinded randomized study compares behavioral and physiologic responses to sedation with one of these medications followed by inhalation or intravenous induction. Ninety-five patients aged 0.5-10 yr scheduled for elective surgery were stratified by age: 30 infants 0.5-2 yr, 38 preschoolers 2.1-5 yr, and 27 school-age children 5.1-10 yr. They were randomized to receive 0.04 ml/kg of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) or sufentanil (2 micrograms/kg). Hemoglobin oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and sedation score were recorded prior to drug administration, at 2.5-min intervals for 10 min, at separation, and during induction with graded halothane in oxygen. Intubation was performed under deep halothane or 3 mg/kg of thiopental and 0.1 mg/kg of pancuronium. Chest wall compliance was assessed qualitatively in all patients prior to intubation. To assess the effects of a mild standardized stress on unpremedicated patients, 75 of the children with parents present were scored before and after oximeter probe placement: of these, in 63% the sedation score did not change; 33% appeared more anxious; and only 4% seemed reassured. Children of all ages reacted negatively to physicians, and 23% were crying prior to administration of drugs. Sufentanil appeared less unpleasant to receive than midazolam: children cried 46 +/- 100 versus 76 +/- 73 s (P less than 0.05), respectively, but by 7.5 min, no child was crying.

Psychomotor performance was tested before and 1, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hr after the drug administration. Simultaneously, blood samples were drawn for determination of plasma drug concentrations. The elimination of each compound was not altered by coadministration of other drugs. As expected, one hour after drug ingestion, psychomotor performance was impaired. The coadministration of drugs increased the effect. During the elimination phase, 6 and 8 hr after the drug intake, only zopiclone and lorazepam in combination slightly impaired performance as compared with the pretreatment levels, but there was no difference as compared with placebo. Adverse events after active treatments were not significantly different from those after placebo. At the recommended dose of 7.5 mg, zopiclone does not alter the elimination pharmacokinetics of the BZD anxiolytics diazepam (5mg) and lorazepam (1 mg), and neither is the elimination of zopiclone affected by these BZDs. Due to the rapid elimination of zopiclone, the increase in sedation seen after concurrent administration with BZDs is of short duration.",

Numerous articles report local sedation techniques for cataract surgery that are, in essence, abbreviated general anesthetic techniques for insertion of the retrobulbar block (RBB). Because of variations in levels of consciousness, a number of complications have been encountered with this specific patient population, ie, movement upon insertion of the RBB, intraoperative patient movement, confusion, hypotension, respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest. In an attempt to meet the specific needs of this patient population, a study comparing propofol-fentanyl with midazolam-fentanyl was initiated. Seventy-five (ASA 1 to 3) patients were randomly assigned to two groups: propofol-fentanyl (P/F) or midazolam-fentanyl (M/F). The mean age of patients in the P/F group was 71.1 +/- 13 SD, and the mean age in the M/F group was 74.4 +/- 8.8 SD. All patients entered the operating room unpremedicated.

This review discusses the association of the mitochondrial receptor for benzodiazepines (mBzR) with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), indicating a possible auxiliary role for VDAC as a putative drug binding protein. The proposed subunit composition of the purified mBzR complex isolated from rat kidney mitochondria includes VDAC, which functions as a recognition site for benzodiazepines (e.g., flunitrazepam), the adenine nucleotide carrier (ADC), and an 18 kDa outer membrane protein identified by covalent labelling with the mBzR antagonists isoquinoline carboxamides (e.g., PK14105).", 
    "62": "1. The properties of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-ion channel complexes and the interaction with the transition metal zinc, were studied on rat sympathetic and cerebellar neurones in dissociated culture using patch clamp recording techniques. 2. The antagonism of GABA-induced membrane currents by zinc on sympathetic neurones was subject to developmental influence. Using embryonic sympathetic neurones acutely cultured for 24-72 h, GABA responses were more depressed by zinc when compared to responses evoked on adult neurones cultured for the same period. For neurones developing in vivo, the percentage inhibition of GABA responses produced by zinc in embryonic neurones was estimated to decline by 50% after 48.2 days following birth. 3. Embryonic sympathetic neurones maintained in culture for prolonged periods (40-50 days in vitro, DIV) became less sensitive to zinc when compared to neurones cultured for shorter periods (10-20 DIV). The decrease in the zinc inhibition for neurones maintained in vitro proceeded at an apparent rate of 0.55% per day. 4. Activation of the GABA receptor by muscimol (0.2-2 microM) was also antagonized by zinc (50-100 microM). 5. Lowering the pH of the perfusing Krebs solution did not affect the inhibition of GABA responses by zinc on sympathetic neurones. 6. Modulation of the GABAA receptor by some benzodiazepines, a barbiturate, a steroid based on pregnanolone, or antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxinin, did not interfere with the antagonism exerted by zinc on sympathetic neurones. A novel binding site for zinc on the GABAA receptor is proposed. 7. Analysis of the GABA-activated current noise on sympathetic neurones revealed two kinetic components to the power spectra requiring a double Lorentzian fit. The time constant describing the fast component (tau 2, 2.1 ms) was unaffected by zinc, whereas the slow component time constant (tau 1, 21.7 ms) was slightly reduced to 17.1 ms. 8. The apparent single-channel conductance for GABA-activated ion channels was determined from the power spectra (gamma s = 22.7 pS) and also from the relationship between the mean GABA-induced inward current and the variance of the current (gamma v = 24 pS). Zinc (25-100 microM) did not affect the single-channel conductance. 9. Single GABA-activated ion channels were recorded from outside-out patches taken from the soma of large cerebellar neurones.

These compounds need to be phosphorylated intracellularly to their triphosphate forms before they act as competitive inhibitors or alternate substrates (chain terminators) of HIV RT. The second group includes the tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,l-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)one (TIBO), 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)-methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT), dipyrido[3,2-b:2',3'-e]-[1,4]diazepin-6-one (nevirapine) and pyridin-2(1H)one derivatives, which interact as such, noncompetitively, with a specific allosteric binding site of HIV-1 RT. Compounds belonging to the two different groups may give rise to synergism which combined, and, likewise, viral resistance to the compounds may arise through different mutations, depending on the nature of the compounds and the group to which they belong.", 
    "64": "Tandospirone has been reported as a serotonergic antianxiety drug with a different pharmacological mechanism from benzodiazepines. In the present study, the brain concentrations of monoamines and their metabolites were measured, comparing control rats and two groups of rats which were given tandospirone (10 mg/kg, ip) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, ip) each for 14 days. After sacrifice, brains of all animals were cut and divided into three portions, i.e. the cortex (COR), cerebellum (CER) and subcortical structures and brain stem (SS & BS). The concentrations of COR and SS & BS were measured using a Neurochemicalanalyzer (NCA, ESA, Inc., USA) with a reverse-phase column (Neurocolumn, Niko Bioscience Inc.). In the COR, 3-O-MDOPA (3-O-methyldopa) increased in the tandospirone group. In the SS & BS, 3-O-MDOPA increased in the diazepam and tandospirone groups. 5HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) and HVA (homovanillic acid) decreased in the tandospirone group.",

The influence of parameters such as acceptor phase flow rate, temperature, hydrophobicity of the analytes, pH, ionic strength and viscosity of the sample on the recovery and rate of dialysis is studied. In addition, methods to reduce the degree of drug-protein binding and thereby improve the recovery are reported. Diazepam, nitrazepam and oxazepam are used as model compounds. A method is reported for the fully automated determination of these compounds in human plasma using only 100 microliters of sample. Data on repeatability, linearity and detectability are given.",

    "67": "We evaluated the effects of a potent cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptor antagonist, L-365,260 (3R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin - 3-yl)-N'-( 3-methylphenyl) urea); a selective CCK-A receptor antagonist, devazepide (L-364,718); and cimetidine on gastric acid secretion induced by pentagastrin, histamine and bethanechol in anesthetized rats. We also evaluated the effects of L-365,260 and cimetidine on acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. Intravenous administration of L-365,260, L-364,718 and cimetidine dose-dependently reduced acid secretion induced by pentagastrin (20 nmol/kg/hr), with ED50 values of 0.63, 19.1 and 2.5 mumol/kg, respectively. Of interest was the finding that L-365,260, like cimetidine, dose-dependently inhibited acid secretion induced by histamine (100 mumol/kg/hr) and bethanechol (5 mumol/kg/hr) with ED50 values of 5.9 and 4.3 mumol/kg, respectively. L-364,718, even at 30 mumol/kg, i.v., had only a slight effect on histamine- or bethanechol-induced acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion was suppressed by treatment with L-365,260 (3-100 mumol/kg, i.v.) and cimetidine (11.9-396.4 mumol/kg, i.v.) in pylorus-ligated rats, with ED50 values of 13.3 and 96.9 mumol/kg, respectively. These results indicate that L-365,260 suppresses acid secretion induced by histamine and bethanechol in rats and that the gastrin receptor plays an important role in acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats.", 
    "68": "1. We have studied the binding of [3H]-RO 15-1788 to membrane preparations of the retina of rabbit (Lepus cunicula) and turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans). 2. In both species, [3H]-RO 15-1788 binding was maximal at 0 degrees C and decreased with increasing temperature. It was saturable, protein concentration-dependent and specific. Flunitrazepam, unlabelled RO 15-1788 and ethyl-beta-carboline were the most effective displacers, whereas RO 5,4864 was ineffective. 3. In both turtle and rabbit retina, Scatchard analysis indicated the presence of a single binding site for [3H]-RO 15-1788. The KD was 0.75 nM in both turtle and rabbit, while the Bmax were 520 and 250 fmol/mg protein in turtle and rabbit respectively. A study of the association rate of [3H]-RO 15-1788 binding revealed faster kinetics in turtle, as compared to rabbit.", 
    "69": "The influence of opiate premedication on analgesic requirements postoperatively was investigated. Out of 98 patients with a lumbar disc prolapse 50 were premedicated with flunitrazepam orally, 48 with pethidine and triflupromazine intramuscularly. The operations were performed under inhalational anaesthesia. The average time up to the first demand for an analgesic was longer following opiate premedication (351 vs. 219 min). Only 45.8% of the patients treated with opiates demanded analgesics postoperatively, compared to 80.0% of those who had a benzodiazepine premedication (P less than 0.01). These clinical data confirm the experimental evidence that pretreatment with opiates diminishes the sustained hyperexcitation of the central nervous system caused by peripheral lesions.", 
    "70": "The effects of behaviorally nonactive doses of melatonin and diazepam were investigated in two test models for anxiolytics in mice to see whether mutual enhancement could be observed when the two treatments were combined. The test models used were the four plates test and the tail suspension test. In the former test anxiolytics increase the number of punished crossings and in the latter increase the duration of immobility of mice suspended by the tail. In the four plates test combined treatment with melatonin (128 and 256 mg/kg IP) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg PO) caused a significant increase in the number of punished crossings, whereas each treatment alone was without effect. Similarly, in the tail suspension test, a clear increase in the duration of immobility was observed after combined treatment (256 mg/kg IP melatonin + 0.5 mg/kg PO diazepam), whereas no effects were observed with the individual treatments alone. These results suggest that melatonin can enhance the anxiolytic actions of diazepam.", 
    "71": "The effect of the maternal use of benzodiazepines (BZD) on the fetus and the newborn infant has been studied in a representative series of 17 newborn infants (BZD group). The pregnancy and the perinatal period were characterized by 20 items. On the 2nd day of life, a neurologic investigation was performed and comprised a total of 38 items, subgrouped into items of reflexes/reactions, tonus, and other symptoms and signs. An optimum finding for each item was selected. The results were compared with a group of 21 newborns fetally exposed to psychotropic drugs other than BZD (drug group) and a reference group of 29 newborns with no known fetal exposure to drugs. Infants in the BZD group had a lower birth weight for birth length, as compared to both the drug group and the reference group. Significant differences in frequency of pre- and perinatal complications and in neuro-behavior between the BZD group and the reference group were found in all groups of items. We conclude that the use of BZD during pregnancy is associated with impaired intrauterine growth and an increased frequency of pre- and perinatal events. It affects the newborn infant neurologically mainly in the form of intoxication and withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "72": "The effect of (U-54494A) cis-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-Pyrrolidinyl)- cyclohexyl] benzamide monohydrochloride, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)- and K(+)-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine [( 3H]ACh) from slices of striatum was investigated. For the purpose of comparison, MK 801, PCP, CGP 37849, CPP, phenytoin and diazepam were investigated under identical conditions. Both U-54494A and the excitatory amino acid antagonists blocked NMDA-evoked release of [3H]ACh but these compounds failed to inhibit K(+)-evoked release of this neurotransmitter. Phenytoin blocked both NMDA and K(+)-evoked release of [3H]ACh, whereas diazepam was ineffective under similar conditions. These observations indicate that excitatory amino acid antagonists, including U-54494A, may mediate their anticonvulsant effect by blocking the activity of NMDA receptors, diazepam by activating the benzodiazepine receptors and phenytoin by inhibiting the activity of various depolarizing agents.", 
    "73": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) are important in esophageal physiology, and mAChR alterations may be involved in ethanol-induced esophageal dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that acute ethanol decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), whereas withdrawal from chronic ethanol results in pressure increases which are reversible by acute ethanol. To see if this increase in LESP is due to upregulation of mAChR, we evaluated both mAChR binding and dose-response curves for bethanechol and atropine-induced changes in LESP before and after acute and chronic ethanol exposure. The number of mAChR sites (Bmax) in LES (3.4 fmol/mg tissue) was lowered by acute ethanol (1.72, -50%); withdrawal from chronic ethanol raised Bmax (5.2, +54%). Acute injection of ethanol into cats in withdrawal reversed this increase in mAChR density (3.1, -10%). These changes correlated with our earlier data on ethanol-induced changes in LESP. However, the dose-response curve for bethanechol-induced pressure increases shifted to the right [ED25 (micrograms/kg); control, 8.6; withdrawal, 21.3], paralleled by an increase in the number of low-affinity agonist binding sites. Thus, 1) the withdrawal-associated increase in Bmax (up-regulation) is more likely to be a compensatory response to deficits (functional subsensitivity) distal to the receptor recognition site than to proximal deficits; 2) the increase in Bmax does not cause LESP hyperactivity; and 3) receptor binding changes do not necessarily translate into physiological changes.", 
    "74": "The present paper describes the ability of benzodiazepine receptor sites to undergo light mediated-plastic changes during the early postnatal development of the chick optic lobe. The postnatal development pattern of these receptors was studied under different levels of light stimulation, i.e. normal-, light-and dark-rearing. At hatching the specific binding of [3H]Flunitrazepam was 0.23 +/- 0.01 pmol/mg protein. The developmental profile shows a sharp and transient peak of receptor overexpression between the 1st and the 2nd postnatal day in three experimental groups. Between the 2nd and the 6th day significant differences were found between the three groups, being this difference maximal during the peak of overexpression. In fact, on the 2nd day the specific [3H]Flunitrazepam binding showed an increase of 17% (P < 0.0005) and a decrease of 34% (P < 0.0005) for light- and dark-reared animals as compared with normally-reared ones. The changes in receptor density were transient since from the 6th day onward they gradually disappeared, being almost identical in the three groups by the day 15. At this moment the number of benzodiazepine receptor sites stabilized at the adult level. Scatchard analysis at the 2nd postnatal day revealed that the differences observed in the high affinity benzodiazepine binding sites between the three groups were due to modifications in the total number of binding sites while the affinity remained unchanged. The maximal number of binding sites were: 2.76 +/- 0.03, 3.40 +/- 0.01 and 1.46 +/- 0.11 pmol/mg protein in normally-, light- and dark-reared chicks, respectively; while the apparent dissociation constants were unaffected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "A series of 2,3-dihydro-9-phenyl-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-one derivatives and related compounds were tested for their ability to bind benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs). Most of the synthesized compounds showed micromolar affinity for BZR peripheral type, but not for the central one, with the exception of compound 4m which displayed an IC50 = 0.407 microM, only 2 fold higher than IC50 for chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "76": "The effects of cellular mediators that contribute to ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA)-receptor function were studied. In vitro, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibited muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake in cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes. The major hydrolysis product of PLA2 activity, arachidonic acid, also inhibited GABA-mediated 36Cl- uptake. The unsaturated nature of arachidonic acid makes it (and its metabolites) highly susceptible to peroxidation by oxygen radicals. Incubation of synaptoneurosomes with the superoxide radical-generating system, xanthine and xanthine oxidase, decreased muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake, suggesting that the peroxidation of arachidonic acid and/or its metabolites interferes with GABAA-receptor function. Another factor involved in ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration is an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Calcium also inhibited GABA-mediated 36Cl- flux, consistent with its ability to activate PLA2. In contrast, Mg2+, which blocks Ca2+ channels, enhanced muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake, consistent with its neuroprotective effects. Each of these cellular processes is activated during cerebral ischemia and can lead to neuronal degeneration. We used a model of transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils to determine if GABAA-receptor regulation is altered in vivo at a time when CA1 hippocampal cells have degenerated. Four days after a 5 minute bilateral carotid artery occlusion, receptor autoradiography was performed to measure the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to the GABA-gated chloride channel. Significant decreases in TBPS binding were observed only in the dendritic layers (stratum oriens and lacunosem moleculare) of the CA1 hippocampus. The results suggest that ischemia-induced cellular processes that contribute to cell death can decrease GABA-gated chloride channels on dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, and that GABAA receptors may also reside on neurons afferent to or intrinsic to the dendritic layers of CA1 hippocampus.", 
    "77": "Data obtained from studies in molecular biology indicate that there may be at least 500 forms of the receptor for the amino acid neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are coupled to Cl- channels in mammalian neurones. In addition to this apparent subtyping, the receptors for GABA can be further differentiated on pharmacological grounds into GABAA and GABAB subclasses. GABAA receptors are coupled to Cl- channels, possess allosteric sites for benzodiazepines, barbiturates and neuroactive steroids and mediate fast synaptic inhibition, while GABAB receptors are coupled through G-proteins to neuronal K+ or Ca++ channels. Activation of these receptors increases K+ or decreases Ca++ conductances and mediates slow synaptic inhibition. Inhibition and potentiation of stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity can be attributed to GABAB site activation. The clinically effective muscle relaxant (-)baclofen is a selective agonist for the GABAB site but the therapeutical potential for antagonists of the receptor has yet to be examined. The present article reviews the background to GABAB receptor research and considers the future of drugs targetting the receptor.", 
    "78": "Beside the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-transporter and the GABAB-autoreceptor, the subsynaptic GABAA-receptor is therapeutically the most relevant target for drug actions influencing GABAergic synaptic transmission. New strategies in drug development focus on partial agonists acting at the benzodiazepine receptor. Since these compounds display less of the undesirable effects associated with the presently used full agonists, a major therapeutic advance is to be expected in the treatment of anxiety disorders and epilepsy. In addition, the extensive structural heterogeneity of GABAA-receptors, derived from a family of more than 15 subunits, may point to an unexpected functional heterogeneity of the receptor which may be exploited pharmacologically. The potential diversity of GABAA-receptor function is presently being analyzed using recombinant GABAA-receptors, which consist of various subunit combinations. These studies point not only to variations in the affinity of GABA, depending on the type of subunit combination, but also to differences in the affinities and intrinsic efficacies of benzodiazepine receptor ligands. Provided these distinctions can be confirmed at GABAA-receptors in situ, a new picture of the physiological and pharmacological regulation of the subsynaptic actions of GABA will emerge.", 
    "79": "This work was performed to compare withdrawal symptoms induced by the administration of the central vs. peripheral benzodiazepine antagonists in rats treated chronically with diazepam (15 mg/kg, SC) for 8 days. Withdrawal was expressed as motor, autonomic, and behavioral signs. Significant withdrawal occurred after the administration of both flumazenil (15 and 20 mg/kg, IP) and PK11195 (5 and 10 mg/kg, IP). With these doses, PK11195 induced diarrhea and decreased motor activity more than did flumazenil. These preliminary results suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the withdrawal syndrome in diazepam-dependent rats.", 
    "80": "Since the introduction of the benzodiazepines into clinical practice in 1960, these drugs have been widely employed as anxiolytics, sedative/hypnotics and anticonvulsants. In recent years, concern has been expressed about their side-effects, and their use has declined. During this latter period many advances have been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these drugs produce their effects. Adam Doble and Ian Martin review this progress and highlight the possibilities that these advances may hold for the development of more efficacious and specific medicines.", 
    "81": "SPECT studies with 123I-iomazenil were performed in 14 patients with hepatic encephalopathy. The activity concentration in the brain decreases spontaneously by 10 to 20% within 80 min, in the nasal tissue by 35%. After an i.v. injection of 0.1 to 0.5 mg flumazenil a decrease of 29 to 38% is observed within 20 min, with a comparable decrease in white matter and nasal tissue. The application of well-known models of receptor kinetics is therefore impossible.", 
    "82": "Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that Ro15-4513, a partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist, decreases self-administration of ethanol (ETOH) in rats maintained on a two-bottle regmine of a saccharin ethanol solution (ES) and water over a 35-day consumption period. The present study extended the consumption period to 60 days and examined the effects of Ro15-4513 (2.5 mg/kg), flumazenil (Ro15-1788) (8.0 mg/kg), and Ro15-4513 in combination with Ro15-1788 on the time course of ETOH self-administration. High initial intake of ES observed during the first 4 weeks declined significantly over subsequent weeks. Ro15-4513 pretreatment, however, resulted in significant reduction of ES, while significantly preventing the \"normal\" reduction of consumption as was observed under control conditions. The antagonistic actions of Ro15-4513 were blocked/attenuated by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro15-1788, independent of whether consumption of the ES was low or high. Both Ro15-4513 and Ro15-1788 affected water intake differentially compared with vehicle-injected controls. The results suggest that GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms may be important in altering chronic ETOH drinking patterns depending upon experience with ETOH, tolerance, or learning.", 
    "83": "Most antidepressants produce changes in monoamine receptors in brain after chronic administration in animals. The most commonly described alterations are a decreased density and function of beta-adrenergic receptors and have been postulated to be the mechanisms by which antidepressants exert their therapeutic effect. Milnacipran (previous name midalcipran) is a new, clinically-effective antidepressant, which inhibits the uptake of both serotonin and noradrenaline but has no affinity for any pre- or postsynaptic receptor studied. When given either orally at 7.5 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days, at 30 mg/kg once daily for 3 weeks, by osmotic mini-pump at 30 mg/kg/day for 27 days, or in drinking water at approximately 15 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks and after a washout period of 24 hr, milnacipran produced no down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors. In addition, there were no alterations of alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptors, 5-HT1, 5-HT2 receptors or benzodiazepine binding sites. Moreover, uptake and accumulation of serotonin and noradrenaline were unmodified. In addition, the potency for milnacipran to inhibit monoamine uptake in vitro in the cortex was not altered in treated rats, compared to control animals. Thus, in spite of its action on both the uptake of serotonin and noradrenaline, milnacipran appears to be without long-term action on beta-adrenoceptors or the other receptors studied, suggesting that, at least for this antidepressant, these modifications are not essential for clinical activity.", 
    "84": "The effect of flunitrazepam upon the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 in vivo was investigated. Acute treatment with flunitrazepam decreased the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner. The time course of radioactivity in the striatum, cerebral cortex and cerebellum in controls and flunitrazepam (1 mg/kg)-treated mice was measured after intravenous injection of [3H]SCH 23390. The binding kinetics were calculated, using the cerebellum as a reference region for the estimation of the amount of free ligand in the brain. Flunitrazepam significantly decreased the input rate constant to the receptor compartment and the dissociation rate constant in vivo. An in vivo displacement study, using carrier SCH 23390, also showed significant reduction in the dissociation rate constant of [3H]SCH 23390 in vivo. The drug Ro 15-1788 reversed the effect of flunitrazepam, suggesting that this reduction in binding of [3H]SCH 23390 was mediated by benzodiazepine receptors. To evaluate the relationship between the reduction in binding of [3H]SCH 23390 in vivo and in vivo occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors, in vivo occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors was measured using [3H]Ro 15-1788. A non-linear relationship was found between the reduction in dopamine D1 receptor binding in vivo and the occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors in vivo, indicating that benzodiazepines exerted the maximum change in dopamine receptor binding at a low fractional occupancy of receptors.", 
    "85": "The effect of three compounds known to allosterically modulate binding to the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxin receptor complex on 4-hydroxy-2,3 [3H]butyric acid (GHB) binding was investigated. Pentobarbital, pentylenetetrazole, and picrotoxin enhanced [3H]GHB binding in a dose dependent fashion. Pentobarbital enhanced 4-hydroxy-2,3 [3H]butyric acid binding was associated with an increase in Bmax while pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin altered the affinity of GHB for its binding site producing a decrease in Kd. These findings suggest that the GHB and GABA receptor complex may share certain moieties in common.", 
    "86": "In the present communication we have investigated the allosteric coupling between the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor and the pharmacologically different benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor subtypes in membranes from various rat nervous system regions. Two types of BZD receptors (type I and type II) have been classically defined using CL 218.872. However, using zolpidem, three different BZD receptors have been identified by binding displacement experiments in membranes. These BZD receptor subtypes displayed high, low, and very low affinity for zolpidem. The distribution of the high- and low-affinity binding sites for zolpidem was similar to that of type I and type II subtypes in cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and adult cerebral cortex. On the other hand, the very-low-affinity binding site was localized in relative high proportion in spinal cord, hippocampus, and newborn cerebral cortex and, to a minor extent, in superior colliculus. The allosteric coupling between the GABAA receptor and the BZD receptor subtypes was different. The high- and low-affinity binding sites for zolpidem seemed to have a similar high degree of coupling, except in spinal cord. On the other hand, the very-low-affinity binding site for zolpidem displayed a low degree of coupling with the GABAA receptor. These results seem to indicate that the different efficacy of GABA in enhancing the [3H]flunitrazepam binding could be due to the different BZD receptor subtypes present in the GABAA/BZD receptor complex and, moreover, led us to speculate that the low GABA efficacy found in membranes from spinal cord, hippocampus, and newborn cerebral cortex might be due to the presence in relatively high proportion of the very-low-affinity binding site for zolpidem.", 
    "87": "The present communication concerns a 30 year-old female patient with panic disorder in whom panic attacks appeared to be seasonally-related. Characteristically, attacks were more frequent and severe during the months of October to May with spontaneous remissions during the months of June to September. Since 70% of patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a variant of affective illness characterized by recurrent winter depressions with remissions in summer, suffer from anxiety disorders, we propose that seasonal panic disorder may be a variant of SAD. Since SAD is associated with phase delay of circadian rhythms, some forms of panic disorder may be related to phase instability of circadian rhythms. Moreover, since administration of artificial bright light therapy is currently the most effective treatment for SAD, it is suggested that patients with panic disorder should be questioned as to whether their symptoms are seasonally related. If a positive association is established, these patients should be offered treatment with light therapy prior to or coincident with the institution of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "88": "The cerebroprotective action of non-NMDA receptor blockade has been assessed in a model of transient global ischaemia using NBQX, 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline, and GYKI 52466, 1-(amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine. HCl. In Wistar rats, prior cauterisation of the vertebral arteries was followed by occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 20 min, with a 7 day survival period before histological evaluation. NBQX, 40 mg/kg, or GYKI 52466, 40 mg/kg, was administered intravenously starting directly after the end of carotid occlusion and ending 3 h later. Both compounds produced significant protection against selective cell loss in the striatum and cortex. Less consistent changes were seen in the hippocampus; protection by NBQX was significant in CA3 but neither compound produced significant protection in CA1. This pattern of protection is interpreted in terms of a blockade of glutamate's action at non-NMDA receptors limited to the initial 3 h of reperfusion.", 
    "89": "In an in vitro electrophysiological single-cell recording model, ethanol had an inhibitory effect on locus coeruleus (LC) neurons at both low (0.1 mmol/l) and high (500 mmol/l) concentrations. In order to test if the benzodiazepine-GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor complex could be implicated in this effect, we tested the interaction of these ethanol concentrations with picrotoxin (100 mmol/l) and RO 15-1788 (10 nmol/l). RO 15-1788 reversed the inhibitory effect induced by ethanol 500 mmol/l, but not by ethanol 0.1 mmol/l; picrotoxin reversed the effects of both concentrations. This indicates that the mechanisms of action of ethanol on LC neurons are not the same for high and low concentrations. Furthermore, the effect of concentrations related to a behavioral effect (greater than 10 mmol/l) was reversed by a low-calcium medium that abolishes transmitter release. Therefore, the inhibition induced by ethanol 500 mmol/l seems to be due to the release of an endogenous benzodiazepine-like compound."
