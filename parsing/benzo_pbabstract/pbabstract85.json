The objective of the authors' study was to evaluate the percentage of surgical patients that are prescribed premedication for preoperative anxiety before their anticipated surgical procedure. A prospective study was carried out by theatre nursing staff in the theatre reception bay of a university teaching hospital. A questionnaire was designed to record the number of patients that described symptoms consistent with preoperative anxiety. The number of patients that had been offered anxiolytic premedication for preoperative anxiety was also recorded. Consent was obtained from 115 consecutive surgical patients (male, n=52; female, n=63). Of these, 66% (n=76) reported anxiety before their surgical procedure (male: n=27, female: n=49). Premedication with a low-dose benzodiazepine was prescribed by an anaesthetist in 4% of cases (n=5). Patients that received premedication preoperatively reported effective relief of their anxiety symptoms This study demonstrates that preoperative patient anxiety is highly prevalent. The authors' findings suggest that premedication with anxiolytic pharmacological therapy may be an underused therapeutic resource for managing preoperative patient anxiety.", 
    "1": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) continues to be a challenge to manage in the ICU setting, and the ideal pharmacological treatment continues to evolve. Dexmedetomidine is a newer agent approved for short-term sedation in the ICU, but its use in the treatment of AWS has been limited. We report a retrospective case series of ten patients who were identified as receiving dexmedetomidine for AWS as designated by electronic pharmacy records. All subjects were male, with a mean age of 53.6 years, and a mean ICU length of stay of 9.3 days. They were all diagnosed with AWS by DSM-IV criteria. All the study patients received dexmedetomidine during their hospital course as a treatment for AWS. Studied variables included demographic data, dose and duration of dexmedetomidine, other pharmaceutical agents, and hemodynamics. Dexmedetomidine was safe to use in all patients, although mechanical ventilation was still required in three patients. With dexmedetomidine, the autonomic hyperactivity was blunted, with a mean 12.8% reduction in rate pressure product observed. Consideration should be given to the combined use of dexmedetomidine with benzodiazepines in the treatment of AWS.", 
    "2": "In the present study, the effects of separate and combined intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of crocin and diazepam were investigated on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. In urethane-anesthetized rats, epileptiform activity was induced by intracortical (i.c.) administration of penicillin (200 IU, 1 \u03bcl) and was analyzed using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings. The icv injections of crocin at doses of 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcg and diazepam at a dose of 10 \u03bcg increased the latency time to onset of first spike wave, and decreased the frequency and amplitude of spike waves. Co-administration of an effective dose of crocin (50 \u03bcg) with an ineffective dose of diazepam (2.5 \u03bcg), increased the latency time to onset of first spike wave and decreased frequency and amplitude of spike waves as compared with crocin (50 \u03bcg). These results indicated that crocin and diazepam produced antiepileptic activities at the levels of the brain. Crocin potentiated the antiepileptic effect of diazepam. A GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor-mediated mechanism may be involved in the antiepileptic activity of crocin.", 
    "3": "Although exercise improves anxiety in humans, it is controversial whether exercise is anxiolytic in rodents. We tested the hypothesis that stress influences the effect of exercise on anxiety-like and defensive behaviors. To explore the neurobiological mechanisms of exercise, we also examined whether exercise alters gene expression for the stress-related peptide galanin. Rats were housed in the presence or absence of a running wheel for 21 d. A subset of these rats were (1) not injected or received a single high, dose of the \u03b2-carboline FG7142 (inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor site) immediately prior to testing or (2) were injected repeatedly with vehicle or FG7142 during the last 10d of exercise. On day 22, anxiety-like and defensive behaviors were measured in the elevated plus maze, shock probe defensive burying, and defensive withdrawal tests. Locus coeruleus prepro-galanin mRNA was measured by in situ hybridization. Exercise and sedentary rats that were not injected exhibited similar behavior in all tests, whereas FG7142 injected immediately prior to the test battery produced intense avoidance and immobility consistent with an anxiety-like response. However, exercise produced anxiolytic-like and active defensive behaviors in the test battery relative to the sedentary condition in rats injected repeatedly with vehicle or FG7142. Exercise also increased prepro-galanin mRNA in the locus coeruleus relative to sedentary controls. These data suggest that the emergence of enhanced adaptive behavior after chronic voluntary exercise is influenced by stress. Our data support a role for galanin in the beneficial consequences of wheel running.",

All extracts, as well as isolated biflavonoids from R. parviflora, were evaluated for their affinity to the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptor. The sedative-hypnotic effects of the fractions were evaluated by measuring sleep latency and sleep duration during pentobarbital-induced sleep in mice after oral administration of the extract fractions.", 
    "6": "Oral administration of RPME (125 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in sleep latency and an increase in sleep duration in mice treated with pentobarbital. The methanol extract produced a hypnotic effect that was fully blocked by \u00b3H-Ro 15-1788 flumazenil (FLU). Further, among the solvent fractions, the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited significant activity. Among the isolated compounds, biflavonoids mesuaferrone B (1), rhusflavone (3), and agathisflavone (4) competitively inhibited FLU binding with a K(i) of 0.280 \u03bcM, 0.045 \u03bcM, and 0.091 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, analysis of the sedative-hypnotic effects of rhusflavone, as well as those of the ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and distilled water fractions revealed that the modulation of both the ethyl acetate fraction and biflavonoid rhusflavone (3) are the most potent in inducing sleep.",

The animal models of SE caused by organophosphate analogs of insecticides are not well characterized. SE caused by OPs paraoxon and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) in rats was characterized by electroencephalogram (EEG), behavioral observations and response to treatment with the benzodiazepine diazepam administered at various stages of SE. A method for SE induction using intrahippocampal infusion of paraoxon was also tested. Infusion of 200nmol paraoxon into the hippocampus caused electrographic seizures in 43/52 (82.7%) animals tested; and of these animals, 14/43 (30%) had self-sustaining seizures that lasted 4-18h after the end of paraoxon infusion. SE was also induced by peripheral subcutaneous injection of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP, 1.25mg/kg) or paraoxon (1.00mg/kg) to rats pretreated with atropine (2mg/kg) and 2-pralidoxime (2-PAM, 50mg/kg) 30min prior to OP injection. SE occurred in 78% paraoxon-treated animals and in 79% of DFP-treated animals. Diazepam (10mg/kg) was administered 10min and 30min after the onset of continuous EEG seizures induced by paraoxon and it terminated SE in a majority of animals at both time points. DFP-induced SE was terminated in 60% animals when diazepam was administered 10min after the onset of continuous EEG seizure activity but diazepam did not terminate SE in any animal when it was administered 30min after the onset of continuous seizures. These studies demonstrate that both paraoxon and DFP can induce SE in rats but refractoriness to diazepam is a feature of DFP induced SE.",

The purpose of this study was to identify a possible dysfunction of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic system in Tourette patients, especially involving the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits and the cerebellum. We studied 11 patients with Tourette syndrome and 11 healthy controls. Positron emission tomography procedure: after injection of 20\u2009mCi of [(11)C]flumazenil, dynamic emission images of the brain were acquired. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained to provide an anatomical framework for the positron emission tomography data analysis. Images of binding potential were created using the two-step version of the simplified reference tissue model. The binding potential images then were spatially normalized, smoothed and compared between groups using statistical parametric mapping. We found decreased binding of GABA(A) receptors in Tourette patients bilaterally in the ventral striatum, globus pallidus, thalamus, amygdala and right insula. In addition, the GABA(A) receptor binding was increased in the bilateral substantia nigra, left periaqueductal grey, right posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral cerebellum. These results are consistent with the longstanding hypothesis that circuits involving the basal ganglia and thalamus are disinhibited in Tourette syndrome patients. In addition, the abnormalities in GABA(A) receptor binding in the insula and cerebellum appear particularly noteworthy based upon recent evidence implicating these structures in the generation of tics.", 
    "25": "This study evaluated the effects of an anesthetic protocol using intravenous ketamine and midazolam, and intramuscular buprenorphine on hematologic variables in cats. Twelve healthy adult cats had blood collected for a complete blood count before and after the induction of anesthesia. There were significant decreases in red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrits after the induction of anesthesia. On average, red blood cell counts and hematocrits decreased by 25%, and hemoglobin concentrations decreased by 24%. Based on hematocrit, 3/12 samples (25%) taken while the cats were anesthetized would have been interpreted as belonging to anemic patients while none of the cats would have been considered anemic before anesthesia. This study suggests that a complete blood count performed on blood taken under anesthesia with this anesthetic protocol should be interpreted cautiously in order to not make a false diagnosis of anemia.",

Any attempt to address the lack of labeling will require national estimates of the numbers of children using each medication, their ages, and other factors, to understand the overall use of these medications. We describe use of analgesics, anesthetics, and sedatives in pediatric inpatients by result of conducting a statistical analysis of medication data from >800,000 pediatric hospitalizations in the United States. The purpose was to provide national estimates for the percentage of hospitalized children receiving specific analgesics, anesthetics, and sedatives and their use by age group.",

    "30": "Recently, several studies have emerged suggesting a role of the intracellular survival pathways in the treatment of mood disorders. In addition, the beneficial effects of using a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants have been shown. With this in mind, we evaluated the effects of the acute administration of fluoxetine (FLX), olanzapine (OLZ) and the combination of fluoxetine/olanzapine on the brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding (CREB), Protein Kinase B (PKB, Akt), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) in the rat brain. Adult Wistar rats received an acute injection of OLZ (3 or 6\u00a0mg/kg) and/or FLX (12.5 or 25\u00a0mg/kg), and were evaluated for Akt, BDNF, CREB, Bcl-2 and BAD protein levels in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Our results showed that treatment with FLX and OLZ alone or in combination increased the Akt, CREB, BDNF, Bcl-2 and BAD levels in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. However, the combination of FLX and OLZ at high doses was associated with a greater increase in the levels of Akt in the prefrontal cortex, and did not have an effect on the levels of BAD in any of the brain areas that we evaluated. Finally, these findings further support the hypothesis that treatment with FLX and OLZ alone or in combination exert neuroprotective effects, and that intracellular survival pathways could be involved in the therapeutic effects of combining antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs in mood disorders.", 
    "31": "Numerous groups have described the rat as an in vivo model for the assessment and prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in humans involving the inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A forms. Even for a well-established substrate-inhibitor pair like midazolam-ketoconazole, however, the magnitude of the DDI in rats (e.g. 1.5- to 5-fold) does not relate to what is observed clinically (e.g. 5- to 16-fold). Because nonlinear substrate pharmacokinetics (PK) may result in a weaker interaction, it was hypothesized that the lower magnitude of interaction observed in rats was due to the saturation of metabolic pathway(s) of midazolam at the doses used (10-20 mg/kg). Therefore, the inhibitory effects of ketoconazole were reevaluated at lower oral (1 and 5 mg/kg) and intravenous (IV) (1 mg/kg) doses of midazolam. In support of the hypothesis, oral exposure at 5 mg/kg dose of midazolam was 18-fold higher compared to that at 1 mg/kg. Furthermore, when the interaction was investigated at the lower midazolam dose (1 mg/kg), ketoconazole increased the IV and oral exposure of midazolam by 7-fold and 11-fold, respectively. A weaker DDI (1.5- to 1.8-fold) was observed at the higher oral midazolam dose. Collectively, these results suggest that the lower reported interaction in rats is likely due to saturation of midazolam clearance at the doses used. Therefore, when the rat is used as a DDI model to screen and differentiate compounds, or predict CYP3A inhibition in humans, it is important to use low doses of midazolam and ensure linear PK.", 
    "32": "Ensemble recording and microfluidic perfusion are recently introduced techniques aimed at removing the laborious nature and low recording success rates of manual patch clamp. Here, we present assay characteristics for these features integrated into one automated electrophysiology platform as applied to the study of GABA(A) channels. A variety of cell types and methods of GABA(A) channel expression were successfully studied (defined as I(GABA)>500 pA), including stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing \u03b1(1)\u03b2(3)\u03b3(2) GABA(A) channels, frozen ready-to-assay (RTA) HEK cells expressing \u03b1(1)\u03b2(3)\u03b3(2) or \u03b1(3)\u03b2(3)\u03b3(2) GABA(A) channels, transiently transfected HEK293T cells expressing \u03b1(1)\u03b2(3)\u03b3(2) GABA(A) channels, and immortalized cultures of human airway smooth muscle cells endogenously expressing GABA(A) channels. Current measurements were successfully studied in multiple cell types with multiple modes of channel expression in response to several classic GABA(A) channel agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators. We obtained success rates above 95% for transiently or stably transfected HEK cells and frozen RTA HEK cells expressing GABA(A) channels. Tissue-derived immortalized cultures of airway smooth muscle cells exhibited a slightly lower recording success rate of 75% using automated patch, which was much higher than the 5% success rate using manual patch clamp technique by the same research group. Responses to agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators compared well to previously reported manual patch results. The data demonstrate that both the biophysics and pharmacologic characterization of GABA(A) channels in a wide variety of cell formats can be performed using this automated patch clamp system.",

Electroencephalography is clearly helpful to characterize focal from generalized SE and to distinguish epileptic events from pseudoseizures, and it is deal to find nonconvulsive SE. Neuroimaging techniques could detect epileptogenic lesions (such as cortical malformations, tumors, demyelinating disorders or strokes) but are common in practice to find negative or controversial results. Pharmacologic management can be essentially arranged in three stages: benzodiazepines for early SE (lasting less than 30 minutes), phenytoin/fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, valproate, levetiracetam or lacosamide for established SE (30-90 minutes), and anesthetics for refractory SE (more than 90 minutes).",

Herein, the synthesis of well-defined amphiphilic CD derivatives, with a \"skirt-type\" architecture, that incorporate long-chain fatty esters at the secondary hydroxyl rim and a variety of chemical functionalities (e. g. iodo, bromo, azido, cysteaminyl or isothiocyanato) at the primary hydroxyls rim is reported. Nanoprecipitation of the new CD facial amphiphiles, or binary mixtures of them, resulted in nanoparticles with average hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 100 to 240 nm that were stable in suspension for several months. The precise size, zeta potential and topology of the nanoparticles are intimately dependent on the functionalization pattern at the CD scaffold. Highly efficient molecular encapsulation capabilities of poorly bioavailable drugs such as diazepam (DZ) were demonstrated for certain derivatives, the drug release profile being dependent on the type of formulation (nanospheres or nanocapsules). The efficiency and versatility of the synthetic strategy, together with the possibility of exploiting the reactivity of the functional groups at the nanoparticle surface, offer excellent opportunities to further manipulate the carrier capabilities of this series of amphiphilic CDs from a bottom-up approach.",

The discovery of drugs depends on the identification of molecules that can play essential roles in the development of liver cancer, for example, Notch pathway molecules. \u03b3-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) can inhibit the cleavage of intramembranous substrates of all Notch receptors and subsequently suppress Notch signaling. However, whether the inhibition of the Notch pathway can suppress or promote HCC growth is still under debate. In this study, we examined the expression of Notch pathway molecules in 20 pairs of HCC tissue with their normal counterparts and a panel of eight HCC cell lines. We also determined the effects of different types of GSI treatments on the cell growth of those HCC cell lines. Our results showed that the molecules of the Notch pathway were expressed in six of the eight HCC cell lines. Those six HCC cell lines were more sensitive to GSI-I treatment than the nonexpression ones. Among the four inhibitors, GSI-X and GSI-XXI exerted no effect on HCC cells growth at all. GSI-IX inhibited the growth of four HCC cell lines at 40 \u03bcmol/l. In contrast, most of these HCC cell lines were susceptible to a low concentration of GSI-I (1.2 \u03bcmol/l) treatment. The suppressive effect of GSI-I on cell growth was because of the inhibition of C-Myc, a Notch target gene. In addition, 80% (16/20) of the specimens showed either an increased expression of at least one Notch receptor or an augmented expression of Jagged1 compared with their normal counterparts. Our study reports for the first time that different kinds of GSIs can block the growth of several HCC cell lines. Our finding suggests that GSI-I is a potential chemical reagent and warrants additional testing in liver cancer therapeutics.", 
    "44": "Both alcohol and benzodiazepine dependence (AD, BD) are severe and chronic conditions with devastating physical and mental health effects. The relative scarcity and controversial evidential status of available pharmacological interventions for the treatment of patients' acute withdrawal syndrome and/or relapse prevention call for the clinical investigation of novel safe and efficacious agents.", 
    "45": "We review published studies of pregabalin as monotherapy in the treatment of AD and BD in more than 450 patients. Available evidence includes four RCTs, two in AD with active comparator drugs (naltrexone, tiapride, and lorazepam) and one placebo-controlled, and one placebo-controlled in BD. We also review other available studies on pregabalin's potential to reduce benzodiazepine consumption, its side effects, especially cognitive, as well as extant reports on its liability for abuse.", 
    "46": "Available evidence suggests that monotherapy with pregabalin, within the dosage range of 150 - 600 mg/d, is a promising \"novel\" option for the safe and efficacious relapse prevention of both AD and BD. However, its efficacy as monotherapy in the acute treatment of AD withdrawal syndrome is still controversial. Clinicians should be cautious in prescribing pregabalin to patients with a history of multiple substance recreational use, and monitor its effects on cognition at dosages above 450 mg/d. Further, well-designed clinical research is still needed for the eventual consolidation of pregabalin's place in the treatment of AD and BD.", 
    "47": "Demented elderly people often show severely fragmented sleep-waking patterns and are associated with disorganized circadian rhythm. Frequent nocturnal awakening and associated behavioral and psychological symptoms in demented people place a heavy burden on their families and care givers, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern to health care practitioner and researchers. Although sleep disturbances in demented people could be classified into not only insomnia type but also irregular pattern type, differentiation has not yet been sufficiently practiced in a clinical setting. Demented people with irregular sleep pattern increase with progressive stage and are often insensitive to the usual pharmacotherapies for insomnia using benzodiazepines or antipsychotics. From the viewpoint of risk-benefit balance, chronotherapies such as artificial bright light or improvement of sleep hygiene could be useful and safety tools for sleep and behavioral problems in the demented elderly.",

Usually delirium tremens responds to management with standard doses of benzodiazepines. Limited literature is available, however, for the management of refractory delirium tremens. We describe a case of refractory delirium tremens in which the patient was successfully managed with a combination of high doses of lorazapam, midazolam, and phenytoin.",

Similarly, antidepressant use was not associated with a higher risk for mortality (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.28-1.16) and was associated with markedly decreased suicide deaths (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.77). However, benzodiazepine use was associated with a substantial increase in mortality (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.13-3.22), and this was attributable to suicidal deaths (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.45-10.12) and to nonsuicidal deaths (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.86-2.97).

Antidepressant use was associated with decreased suicide deaths. The literature indicates that long-term use of benzodiazepines among patients with schizophrenia is more prevalent in other countries (eg, the United States) compared with Finland, which suggests that benzodiazepine use may contribute to mortality among this patient population worldwide.", 
    "57": "Benzodiazepine use increases the risk of falls and has been associated with an increased risk of hip fractures. Our aim was to estimate the possible population impact of the use of benzodiazepines on the rate of hip fracture in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We conducted a literature review to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) for hip fractures and use of benzodiazepines. Prevalence rates of benzodiazepine use in 2009 were calculated for each country using the IMS MIDAS database and three public databases in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway. Both the RR and prevalence rates were used for calculation of population attributable risks (PARs) of hip fractures associated with benzodiazepine use. The literature review showed an increased risk of hip fractures in benzodiazepine users (RR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.2-1.6). Rate of benzodiazepine use showed considerable differences between countries, ranging from 4.7 % to 22.3 % of population ever in a 1-year period. These are reflected in results for the PARs; estimated attributions of benzodiazepines to the rate of hip fractures were 1.8 %, 95 % CI 1.1-2.6 (Germany); 2.0 %, 95 % CI 1.2-2.8 (United Kingdom); 5.2 %, 95 % CI 3.2-7.3 (Italy); 7.4 %, 95 % CI 4.5-10.0 (France); 8.0 %, 95 % CI 4.9-11.0 (United States); and 8.2 %, 95 % CI 5.1-12.0 (Spain). PAR estimates suggest that the potential attribution of benzodiazepine use on the population rate of hip fractures in the five specified European countries and the United States varies between 1.8 % and 8.2 %. During the next phase of the IMI-PROTECT study, a comparison with individual patient data will show whether this approach is valid.", 
    "58": "Guava leaf tea (GLT) contains guava leaf polyphenol (Gvpp), which regulates the absorption of dietary carbohydrate from the intestines. Borderline diabetics, who are at high risk of development of diabetes, take GLT to suppress a rapid increase of blood sugar level after meals. However, patients with diabetes in whom diabetic drugs or warfarin as a blood thinner are prescribed also take GLT with the expectation of glycemic control. Therefore, we studied whether GLT had potential for inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and an influence on the action of warfarin. Extract of guava leaf (GvEx) consists of carbohydrate and polyphenols, which are Gvpp, quercetin, and ellagic acid. These polyphenols, but not GvEx, showed a certain level of inhibition of human-cDNA-expressed CYPs. In a comparison of GLT and grapefruit juice, GLT showed weaker inhibition of CYP activities and of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation than grapefruit juice. Furthermore, neither liver weight nor CYP3A expression in the liver was changed in rats that received GvEx for 90\u2009days compared with the control group. When rats were concomitantly treated with GLT and warfarin, the prolongation of clotting time of blood by warfarin was not influenced. These data suggest that GLT is unlikely to interact with drugs.",

This assay was sensitive, accurate and simple, and only used 200 \u03bcL of plasma sample. Samples were liquid-liquid extracted, and diazepam was used as an internal standard. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 reversed-phase analytic column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (10 mmol L(-1), pH 4.80) (60:40, v/v). UV detection was conducted at 205 nm and the column oven was set at 40\u00b0C. Calibration curves were constructed between 0.5-20 \u03bcg mL(-1) for LPV and 0.05-5 \u03bcg mL(-1) for RTV. The relative standard deviations were 2.16%-3.20% for LPV and 2.12%-2.60% for RTV for intra-day analysis, and 2.34%-4.04% for LPV and 0.31%-4.94% for RTV for inter-day analysis. The accuracy was within 100%\u00b110%. The mean extraction recoveries were 79.17%, 52.26% and 91.35% for RTV, LPV and diazepam, respectively.

Three quarters of patients received a benzodiazepine as first-line therapy (74.7%). Phenytoin (33.3%) and levetiracetam (10%) were commonly used as the second AED. Continuous infusions of propofol, barbiturate, or benzodiazepine were used in 36% of patients. Median time to resolution of SE was 1 day and was positively associated with presence of a complex partial seizure, AED non-compliance prior to admission, and lorazepam plus another AED as initial therapy. Prolonged ICU length of stay and topiramate therapy prior to admission were negatively associated with SE resolution.

Employed participants reported higher treatment satisfaction and a pattern of positive associations was found between satisfaction and general health, mental health, social functioning, lower methadone doses, and participants' ratings of their treatment progress. Lower satisfaction was associated with higher frequency of benzodiazepine use, and, for women, longer treatment duration.

Baclofen is the only centrally acting spasmolytic registered in Norway and is the first choice for peroral treatment. Benzodiazepines can also be used. The effect of the tablets is generally limited and there are often pronounced side effects. Local spasticity can be treated with botulinum toxin injections. The effect is time-limited and the treatment must be repeated. International guidelines recommend a combination of botulinum toxin injections and physiotherapy. In cases of regional spasticity, particularly in the lower limbs, intrathecal baclofen administered via a programmable pump may provide a continuous spasm-reducing effect.

To assess the mnemonic effects of selective blockade in perirhinal cortex of muscarinic receptor subtypes, we locally infused either the m1-selective antagonist pirenzepine or the m2-selective antagonist methoctramine in animals performing one-trial visual recognition, and compared these scores with those following infusions of equivalent volumes of saline. Compared to these control infusions, injections of pirenzepine, but not of methoctramine, significantly impaired recognition accuracy. Further, similar doses of scopolamine and pirenzepine yielded similar deficits, suggesting that the deficits obtained earlier with scopolamine were due mainly, if not exclusively, to blockade of m1 receptors. The present findings indicate that m1 and m2 receptors have functionally dissociable roles, and that the formation of new visual memories is critically dependent on the cholinergic activation of m1 receptors located on perirhinal cells.",

It is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and is degraded at the post-ER pre-Golgi compartment, and a role in processing of secreted peptides has been hypothesized. The present study examines localization of RESP18 in the gastrointestinal mucosa of rats by immunohistochemistry, and expression and regulation in response to hypergastrinemia induced by acid inhibition (pantoprazole), gastrin antagonism (YF476), fasting-refeeding and octreotide by mRNA measurements. RESP18 was mainly found in the gastric mucosa, but could also be detected in a few, scattered cells in the lower small intestine and in colon. In the antral mucosa, all RESP18 immunoreactivity was localized to ghrelin-producing A-like cells and gastrin-producing G-cells. In the corpus mucosa, a significant fraction, but not all of the RESP18 immunoreactive cells, were A-like cells. In both antrum and corpus, Resp18 mRNA seemed to vary similarly with the activation of the A-like cells, and in the antrum also with stimulation of the G-cells. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the localization of RESP18 to specific neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa and that it seems to be regulated synchronously with the peptides secreted from these cells. This suggests that Resp18 may indeed have a functional role in the synthesis or storage of these gastrointestinal peptides.",

    "105": "Studies on ligand interaction with quadruplex DNA, and their role in stabilizing the complex at concentration prevailing under physiological condition, has attained high interest. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and spectroscopic studies in solution were used to evaluate the interaction of PBD and TMPyP4 ligands, stoichiometry and selectivity to G-quadruplex DNA. Two synthetic ligands from PBD family, namely pyrene-linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine hybrid (PBD1), mixed imine-amide pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD2) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP4) were studied. G-rich single-stranded oligonucleotide d(5'GGGGTTGGGG3') designated as d(T(2)G(8)), from the telomeric region of Tetrahymena Glaucoma, was considered for the interaction with ligands. ESI-MS and spectroscopic methods viz., circular dichroism (CD), UV-Visible, and fluorescence were employed to investigate the G-quadruplex structures formed by d(T(2)G(8)) sequence and its interaction with PBD and TMPyP4 ligands. From ESI-MS spectra, it is evident that the majority of quadruplexes exist as d(T(2)G(8))(2) and d(T(2)G(8))(4) forms possessing two to ten cations in the centre, thereby stabilizing the complex. CD band of PBD1 and PBD2 showed hypo and hyperchromicity, on interaction with quadruplex DNA, indicating unfolding and stabilization of quadruplex DNA complex, respectively. UV-Visible and fluorescence experiments suggest that PBD1 bind externally where as PBD2 intercalate moderately and bind externally to G-quadruplex DNA. Further, melting experiments using SYBR Green indicate that PBD1 unfolds and PBD2 stabilizes the G-quadruplex complex. ITC experiments using d(T(2)G(8)) quadruplex with PBD ligands reveal that PBD1 and PBD2 prefer external/loop binding and external/intercalative binding to quadruplex DNA, respectively. From experimental results it is clear that the interaction of PBD2 and TMPyP4 impart higher stability to the quadruplex complex.",

NCSE can be defined as a condition of ongoing or intermittent clinical epileptic activity without convulsions, for at least 30 minutes, with electroencephalographic evidence of seizures. NCSE accounts for approximately one-quarter of all cases of status epilepticus. NCSE should be suspected in children with epilepsy who undergo an otherwise inexplicable change in behavior and in children with recent onset change in speech, memory, school performance. NCSE can be observed in acute neurological injuries, specific childhood epilepsy syndromes, individuals with learning difficulties and other neurological conditions. NCSE is not uncommon in pediatric patients with an altered state of consciousness. NCSE in children is thought to be under-recognized. It is a highly heterogeneous clinical condition that is understudied in the pediatric population. Prompt recognition and treatment may be necessary to improve neurological outcome. Based on clinical semiology alone, diagnosis is difficult and requires emergent EEG. Management is often difficult, with highly variable response to treatment. Here I describe the diagnosis and management of NCSE in children.", 
    "107": "This roadside study is the Danish part of the EU-project DRUID (Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines) and included three representative regions in Denmark. Oral fluid samples (n=3002) were collected randomly from drivers using a sampling scheme stratified by time, season, and road type. The oral fluid samples were screened for 29 illegal and legal psychoactive substances and metabolites as well as ethanol. Fourteen (0.5%) drivers were positive for ethanol (alone or in combination with drugs) at concentrations above 0.53g/l, which is the Danish legal limit. The percentage of drivers positive for medicinal drugs above the Danish legal concentration limit was 0.4%; while, 0.3% of the drivers tested positive for one or more illicit drug at concentrations exceeding the Danish legal limit. Tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, and amphetamine were the most frequent illicit drugs detected above the limit of quantitation (LOQ); while, codeine, tramadol, zopiclone, and benzodiazepines were the most frequent legal drugs. Middle aged men (median age 47.5 years) dominated the drunk driving group, while the drivers positive for illegal drugs consisted mainly of young men (median age 26 years). Middle aged women (median age 44.5 years) often tested positive for benzodiazepines at concentrations exceeding the legal limits. Interestingly, 0.6% of drivers tested positive for tramadol, at concentrations above the DRUID cut off; although, tramadol is not included in the Danish list of narcotic drugs. It can be concluded that driving under the influence of drugs is as serious a road safety problem as drunk driving.",

In a recent study, we demonstrated that CSF orexin levels were significantly higher in patients experiencing panic attacks compared to non-panicking depressed subjects (Johnson et al., 2010 [9]). Furthermore, genetically silencing orexin synthesis or blocking orexin 1 receptors attenuated lactate-induced panic in an animal model of panic disorder.

Vitexin (100 and 200 \u03bcm, i.c.v) affected minimal clonic seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole by increasing the seizure onset time. Pretreatment with flumazenil suppressed the anticonvulsant effects of vitexin during the onset of both the seizures.

Older people fall more often for a variety of reasons: alterations in physiology and physical functioning, and the use (and misuse) of medications needed to manage their multiple conditions. Pharmacological factors that place the elderly at greater risk of drug-related side effects include changes in body composition, serum albumin, total body water, and hepatic and renal functioning. Drug use is one of the most modifiable risk factors for falls and falls-related injuries. Fall-risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) include drugs for cardiovascular diseases (such as digoxin, type 1a anti-arrhythmics and diuretics), benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, antiparkinsonian drugs, opioids and urological spasmolytics. Psychotropic and benzodiazepine drug use is most consistently associated with falls. Despite the promise of a more favourable side-effect profile, evidence shows that atypical antipsychotic medications and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants do not reduce the risk of falls and hip fractures. Despite multiple efforts with regards to managing medication-associated falls, there is no clear evidence for an effective intervention. Stopping or lowering the dose of psychotropic drugs and benzodiazepines does work, but ensuring a patient remains off these drugs is a challenge. Computer-assisted alerts coupled with electronic prescribing tools are a promising approach to lowering the risk of falls as the use of information technologies expands within healthcare.",

In this study, the effects of cholinergic stimulation were studied on the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration of granule neurones of the rat dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Ca(2+) transients were recorded in Oregon-Green-BAPTA 1-loaded brain slices using a calcium imaging technique. For the detection, identification and characterisation of the Ca(2+) transients, a wavelet analysis-based method was developed. Granule cells were identified on the basis of their size and localisation. The action potential-coupled character of the Ca(2+) transients of the granule cells was established by recording fluorescence changes and electrical activity simultaneously. Application of the cholinergic agonist carbamyl-choline (CCh) significantly increased the frequency of the Ca(2+) transients (from 0.37 to 6.31 min(-1), corresponding to a 17.1-fold increase; n = 89). This effect was antagonised by atropine, whereas CCh could still evoke an 8.3-fold increase of the frequency of the Ca(2+) transients when hexamethonium was present. Using immunolabelling, the expression of both type 1 and type 3 muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3 receptors, respectively) was demonstrated in the granule cells. Application of 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide (an M3-specific antagonist) prevented the onset of the CCh effect, whereas an M1-specific antagonist (pirenzepine) was less effective. We conclude that cholinergic stimulation increases the activity of granule cells, mainly by acting on their M3 receptors. The modulation of the firing activity of the granule cells, in turn, may modify the firing of projection neurones and may adjust signal processing in the entire DCN.",

In 2 concurrent studies, patients received open-label olanzapine for 12 weeks after 12 weeks of double-blind olanzapine or placebo. Open-label dosing started at 2.5 or 5 mg/d and could be increased up to 20 mg/d (study 1) or 15 mg/d (study 2). The primary efficacy measure was open-label baseline-to-endpoint change in Zanarini Rating Scale for BPD (ZAN-BPD) total score. Of 472 patients who completed the double-blind acute phase, 444 entered and 320 (72.1%) completed 12 weeks of open-label extension treatment. Mean ZAN-BPD total scores at the start of the acute phase were approximately 17, indicating moderate symptom severity. Mean ZAN-BPD total scores ranged from 7.8 to 10.5 at the start of the open-label treatment and decreased to 5.7 to 6.5, indicating mild symptom severity, by the end of the open-label treatment. Patients taking placebo during the acute phase showed increases in weight, prolactin level, and other laboratory values during open-label olanzapine treatment similar in magnitude to increases seen in olanzapine-treated patients during the acute phase. Patients proceeding from olanzapine during the acute phase to open-label olanzapine showed smaller changes in weight and laboratory values. In conclusion, these results suggest that continued therapy with olanzapine may sustain and build upon improvements seen with acute olanzapine treatment of patients with BPD. However, no medication is currently approved for treatment of BPD, and physicians should carefully weigh potential benefits and risks of antipsychotic treatment in this population.", 
    "158": "Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra, GG) is one of the most frequently used herbal medicines worldwide, and its various biological activities have been widely studied. GG is reported to have neurological properties such as antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects. However, its hypnotic effects and the mechanism of GG and its active compounds have not yet been demonstrated. In this study, GG ethanol extract (GGE) dose-dependently potentiated pentobarbital-induced sleep and increased the amount of non-rapid eye movement sleep in mice without decreasing delta activity. The hypnotic effect of GGE was completely inhibited by flumazenil, which is a well-known \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A-benzodiazepine (GABA(A)-BZD) receptor antagonist, similar to other GABA(A)-BZD receptor agonists (e.g., diazepam and zolpidem). The major flavonoid glabrol was isolated from the flavonoid-rich fraction of GGE; it inhibited [(3)H] flumazenil binding to the GABA(A)-BZD receptors in rat cerebral cortex membrane with a binding affinity (K(i)) of 1.63 \u03bcM. The molecular structure and pharmacophore model of glabrol and liquiritigenin indicate that the isoprenyl groups of glabrol may play a key role in binding to GABA(A)-BZD receptors. Glabrol increased sleep duration and decreased sleep latency in a dose-dependent manner (5, 10, 25, and 50mg/kg); its hypnotic effect was also blocked by flumazenil. The results imply that GGE and its flavonoid glabrol induce sleep via a positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A)-BZD receptors.",

A central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect of the hexane fraction from the ethanolic extract of this plant has been described. \u03b2-caryophyllene, the main component of this essential oil, is a sesquiterpene compound with anti-inflammatory properties that has been found in essential oils derived from several medicinal plants. This work is aimed to evaluate the pharmacological activity of the essential oil obtained from S. odoratissima leaves (EO) and its major component on the murine CNS; we aimed to evaluate a possible anxiolytic-like effect and the underlying mechanisms involved. In an open field test, EO (500 mg/kg) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) increased the crossing frequency (P<0.05) and, EO (250 and 500 mg/kg) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (200 mg/kg) increased the time spent in the center (P<0.05) without altering total crossings of the open field. EO and \u03b2-caryophyllene did not alter the number of falls in the rota-rod test (P>0.05). In the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, EO (500 mg/kg) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (200 and 400 mg/kg) decreased the latency to sleep (P<0.05), and EO (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg) (P<0.001) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (200 and 400 mg/kg) (P<0.05 and P<0.001) increased the sleep time. In anxiety tests, EO (500 mg/kg) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (100 and 200 mg/kg) increased head-dipping behavior (P<0.05) in the hole-board test, entries (P<0.05) into and time spent (P<0.05) on the open arms of the elevated plus maze (EPM), and number of transitions (P<0.05) and time spent in the light compartment (P<0.05) of a light-dark box (LDB). We further investigated the mechanism of action underlying the anxiolytic-like effect of EO and \u03b2-caryophyllene by pre-treating animals with antagonists of benzodiazepine (flumazenil) and 5-HT(1A) (NAN-190) receptors prior to evaluation using EPM and LDB. The anxiolytic-like effects of EO were significantly reduced by pre-treatment with NAN-190 (P<0.05) but not flumazenil (P>0.05). The anxiolytic-like effects of \u03b2-caryophyllene were not blocked by either NAN-190 or flumazenil (P>0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that the essential oil derived from S. odoratissima produces an anxiolytic-like effect without altering motor performance and that this effect is mediated by 5-HT(1A) but not via benzodiazepine receptors. In addition, the major component, \u03b2-caryophyllene, also has an anxiolytic-like effect that may contribute to the effects of EO, but this effect does not seem to be mediated via 5-HT(1A) or benzodiazepine receptors.",

Here, we demonstrate impaired CF synapse elimination in mouse models with diminished GABAergic transmission by mutation of a single allele for the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD67, by conditional deletion of GAD67 from PCs and GABAergic interneurons or by pharmacological inhibition of cerebellar GAD activity. The impaired CF synapse elimination was rescued by enhancing GABA(A) receptor sensitivity in the cerebellum by locally applied diazepam. Our electrophysiological and Ca2+ imaging data suggest that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition onto the PC soma from molecular layer interneurons influences CF-induced Ca2+ transients in the soma and regulates CF synapse elimination from postnatal day 10 (P10) to around P16.",

Agonists at the BDZ binding site potentiate submaximal GABA responses by increasing the apparent affinity of GABA(A)Rs for GABA. Although BDZs were initially thought to affect the binding of GABA agonists, recent studies suggest an effect on receptor gating; however, the involvement of preactivation steps in the modulation by BDZs has not been considered. Consequently, we examined whether BDZ agonists could exert their modulatory effect by displacing the equilibrium between resting and preactivated states of recombinant \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABA(A)Rs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. For GABA and the partial agonists 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol and piperidine-4-sulfonic acid, we examined BDZ modulation using a simple three-step model incorporating agonist binding, receptor preactivation, and channel opening. The model accounted for diazepam modulation simply by increasing the preactivation constant by approximately fourfold. To assess whether BDZs preferentially affected a specific GABA binding site, pentameric concatamers were used. This demonstrated that single GABA-binding site mutant receptors were equally sensitive to modulation by BDZs compared with wild-type counterparts. Overall, our results suggest that BDZs affect the preactivation step to cause a global conformational rearrangement of GABA(A)Rs, thereby modulating receptor function.",

    "205": "Spinal gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABA(A)) receptor modulation with agonists and allosteric modulators evokes analgesia and antinociception. Changes in K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter isoform 2 (KCC2) expression or function that occur after peripheral nerve injury can result in an impairment in the Cl(-) extrusion capacity of spinal dorsal horn neurons. This, in turn, alters Cl(-)-mediated hyperpolarization via GABA(A) receptor activation, contributing to allodynia or hypersensitivity associated with nerve injury or inflammation. A gap in knowledge exists concerning how this loss of spinal KCC2 activity differentially impacts the analgesic efficacy or potency of GABA(A) agonists and allosteric modulators. We utilized intrathecal drug administration in the tail flick assay to measure the analgesic effects of general GABA(A) agonists muscimol and Z-3-[(aminoiminomethyl)thio]prop-2-enoic acid (ZAPA), the \u2202-subunit-preferring agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP), and allosteric modulators of the benzodiazepine (midazolam) and neurosteroid (ganaxolone) class, alone or in the presence of K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter isoform (KCC) blockade. Intrathecal muscimol, ZAPA, THIP midazolam, and ganaxolone all evoked significant analgesia in the tail flick test. Coadministration of either agonists or allosteric modulators with [(dihydroindenyl)oxy] alkanoic acid (DIOA) (a drug that blocks KCC2) had no effect on agonist or allosteric modulator potency. On the other hand, the analgesic efficacy of muscimol and ZAPA and the allosteric modulator ganaxolone were markedly reduced whereas THIP and midazolam were unaffected. Finally, in the spared nerve injury model, midazolam significantly reversed tactile hypersensitivity while ganaxolone had no effect.

In appears that tolerance develops relatively quickly for the sedative and anticonvulsant actions of benzodiazepines, whereas tolerance to anxiolytic and amnesic effects probably does not develop at all. In light of this evidence, we review the current evidence for the neuroadaptive mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine tolerance, including changes of (i) the GABA(A) receptor (subunit expression and receptor coupling), (ii) intracellular changes stemming from transcriptional and neurotrophic factors, (iii) ionotropic glutamate receptors, (iv) other neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine systems), and (v) the neurosteroid system. From the large variance in the studies, it appears that either different (simultaneous) tolerance mechanisms occur depending on the benzodiazepine effect, or that the tolerance-inducing mechanism depends on the activated GABA(A) receptor subtypes.

Unstimulated (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva samples (SWS) were collected, and their flow rates were determined. Salivary levels of cortisol, 17\u03b2-estradiol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and enzymatic activity of \u03b1-amylase were determined. Salivary transferrin level was measured to determine the level of blood contamination in saliva samples.", 
    "215": "\u2002 The levels of all analytes in UWS were significantly correlated with those of SWS. The levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol, progesterone, and DHEA in UWS were significantly correlated with age. Age-matched comparisons revealed that the patient group had significantly higher levels of cortisol in UWS and of 17\u03b2-estradiol in SWS. When the patients were divided into older (\u226560years) and younger (<60years) groups, the older group showed a significantly lower level of progesterone in UWS. There were no significant relationships between treatment efficacy and levels of salivary analytes.", 
    "216": "In conclusion, patients with BMS showed significantly higher levels of cortisol in UWS and of 17\u03b2-estradiol in SWS compared with controls."
