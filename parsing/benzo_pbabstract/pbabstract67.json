    "0": "The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) is a major target of antiseizure drugs (ASDs). A variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR function, led to the development of ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic \"tone\" by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for \"GABAergic\" ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs. Manipulation of subunit expression patterns or novel ASDs targeting the altered receptors may provide a novel approach for seizure prevention.",

    "2": "Patients (n=16) were sedated with propofol during the first 24 hours after intubation, then with midazolam, following a predefined algorithm. Systemic hemodynamics, perfusion parameters, and microcirculation were assessed at 2 time points: just before stopping propofol and 30 minutes after the start of midazolam infusion. Sublingual microcirculation was evaluated by sidestream dark-field imaging.",

    "5": "A statistical tool equipped with Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and central composite design (CCD) was used for fast stacking analysis of ten frequently consumed drugs, namely codeine, morphine, methamphetamine, ketamine, alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam and oxazepam, by capillary electrophoresis (CE). This statistical design is expected to help quick analysis with few procedures, avoiding tedious work required because of the large number of variables or parameters. A large volume sample stacking (LVSS)-sweeping CE is developed for concentrating and analyzing the 10 abused drugs. First, phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 2.3) containing methanol was filled into a capillary and then the extracted urine sample was loaded (1 psi, 200 s) to enhance sensitivity. The sweeping and separating steps were completed simultaneously by phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 2.3) containing methanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate, within 15 min. Better resolution was obtained by the experimental design than the \"one factor at a time\" (OFAT) approach. During method validation, calibration plots were linear (r>0.998), over a range of 25-1500 ng/mL for the six benzodiazepines, methamphetamine and ketamine, and 50-3000 ng/mL for codeine and morphine. The RSD of precision and absolute RE of accuracy in intra-day and inter-day assays were below 14.54% and 16.61%, respectively. The minimum limits for detection (S/N=3) of analytes were in the range of 7.5-30 ng/mL. This stacking method increased sensitivity more than 200-fold and can be applied for detection of the presence of methamphetamine in an abuser's urine (3600 ng/mL), which was confirmed by GC-MS. The method is considered feasible for fast screening of abused drugs in urine.",

    "8": "One thousand seventy-eight drivers were included in the study. Alcohol (\u22650.1 g/L) was the most common substance (26.2%). A large majority of the drivers (64%) who were positive for alcohol had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) \u22651.3 g/L (legal limit in Belgium: 0.5 g/L). These high BACs were most frequent among male injured drivers. Cannabis was the most prevalent illicit drug (5.3%) and benzodiazepines (5.3%) were the most prevalent medicinal drugs. Approximately 1 percent of the drivers were positive for cocaine and amphetamines. No drivers tested positive for illicit opioids. Medicinal drugs were more likely to be found among female drivers and drivers older than 35 years, and alcohol and illicit drugs were more likely to be found among male drivers and drivers younger than 35 years.",

The introduction of a categorization and labeling system might reduce driving under the influence of medicinal drugs by informing health care professionals and patients.", 
    "10": "Abstract Enzyme kinetic parameters provide essential quantitative information about characterization of individual steps in drug metabolism. Such enzymes are located in a (partially) aqueous environment. For in vitro measurements potential lipophilic substrates regularly require organic solvents to achieve concentrations sufficient for access of the drug to the binding site of the enzyme. However, solvents may interact with the enzymes. In this study, we investigated the effects of methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide (1% to 4%) on the assessment of km, Vmax and Clint for the metabolism of midazolam via CYP3A4 to 1-hydroxymidazolam and the metabolism of caffeine to paraxanthine via CYP1A2 using expressed enzymes in vitro. The presence of acetonitrile proved the highest apparent Vmax value for paraxanthine formation but the lowest values for 1-hydroxymidazolam formation. The km value for midazolam showed no systematic effects of organic solvents, while for caffeine km was up to 8-fold lower for solvent free samples compared to solvent containing samples. The present example suggests that effects of solvents may considerably influence enzyme kinetic parameters beyond a mere change in apparent activity. These effects illustrate a difference for individual enzyme--substrate pairs, solvents, and solvent concentrations. What remains is the determination to which extent these effects compromise in vitro-in vivo extrapolations, and which solvents are most appropriate.", 
    "11": "Pharmacoepidemiological studies provide valuable information on the relationships between psychotropic drug use and adverse outcomes in older people. To minimize the influence of misclassification bias in pharmacoepidemiological studies, more emphasis should be given to methodological aspects of exposure assessment. This study evaluated the validity of a dosage assumption of one unit per day for measuring legend duration of psychotropic drug exposures among older people. Using data from the Finnish Prescription Register, the study analysed 62,320 psychotropic drug prescriptions dispensed for people aged\u2009\u2265\u200975 years (n\u2009=\u200952,729) in September 2009. The proportions of prescriptions in which the prescribed dose deviated from one unit per day were assessed for categories and subcategories of psychotropic drugs. The prescription was considered misclassified (a) if the prescribed drug was intended for \"as needed\" use, (b) if the prescription included a dose range, or (c) if the prescribed dose was below or above one unit per day. Among antidepressants, less than every fourth (23.7%) prescription was misclassified. The proportions of misclassification varied substantially across subcategories, being 13.1% for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 25.3% for other antidepressants and 53.8% for tricyclic antidepressants. Of the benzodiazepine and antipsychotic prescriptions, 79.9% and 57.6%, respectively, were misclassified. In conclusion, the dosage assumption of one unit per day is valid for measuring the legend duration of SSRI and other antidepressant exposures among older people. Among other psychotropic drugs, the dosage assumption is likely to lead to severe exposure misclassification.", 
    "12": "The dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and noradrenergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress disorder. The effect of selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine on anxiety indices was investigated by using elevated plus maze, following exposure to trauma reminder. Upon receiving the approval of ethics committee, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to dirty cat litter (trauma) for 10\u00a0min and 1\u00a0week later, the rats confronted to a trauma reminder (clean litter). The rats also received intraperitoneal pirenzepine (1 or 2\u00a0mg/kg/day) or saline for 8\u00a0days. Noradrenaline (NA) concentration in the rostral pons was analyzed by HPLC with electrochemical detection. The anxiety indices of the rats subjected to the trauma reminder were increased when compared to control rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Pirenzepine treatment in traumatized rats displayed similar anxiety indices of non-traumatized rats treated with physiological saline. Although freezing time was prolonged with pirenzepine in traumatized groups the change was not found statistically significant. The NA level was 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0pg/mg in non-traumatized rats and increased to 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0pg/mg in traumatized rats. Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that the NA content of the rostral pons of the traumatized rats treated with physiological saline was significantly higher than the content of other groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). We conclude that NA content in the rostral pons increases in respect to confrontation to a trauma reminder which can be reversed by M1 antagonist pirenzepine indicating the roles of M1 receptors.", 
    "13": "\u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) spillover from synaptic cleft activates extrasynaptic GABAA receptor and results in a tonic inhibition, which induces a background inhibitory effect to stabilize the membrane potential of the neuronal cells. However, the role of tonic inhibition and how it can be regulated during brain development and epileptic state remain elusive. By whole-cell patch-clamp recording on the granule cell in the dentate gyrus, we recorded tonic conductance to investigate the level of tonic inhibition in these two critical periods. According to our observation, an age-dependent increase in tonic conductance was observed. Furthermore, a change in tonic inhibition was also found in a chronic epileptic animal model, indicating that the alteration in tonic inhibition after epilepsy induction persists for a long duration to modulate neuronal activities. The present results show that tonic inhibition is altered during brain development and a chronic epileptic condition, indicating a role of the tonic inhibitory effect in both the critical periods.",

Olanzapine has various affinities for multiple receptors, including dopamine D2 receptor, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6 receptors, and adrenaline alpha1, histamine H1, muscarine M1-M5 receptors as well. Therefore, olanzapine is known as MARTA(multi-acting receptor targeted antipsychotics). Numerous studies have been conducted to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine between SGAs and FGAs (first-generation antipsychotics). According to the head-to-head meta-analysis and large-scale studies like CATIE and EUFEST, olanzapine seems to have not only higher efficacy but also less discontinuation comparing to other anti-psychotics.",

To investigate the potential of TSPO as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the current study assessed the effects of the TSPO ligand Ro5-4864 on the development of neuropathology in 3xTgAD mice. The effects of the TSPO ligand on neurosteroidogenesis and AD-related neuropathology, including \u03b2-amyloid accumulation, gliosis, and behavioral impairment, were examined under both early intervention (7-month-old young-adult male mice with low pathology) and treatment (24-month-old, aged male mice with advanced neuropathology) conditions. Ro5-4864 treatment not only effectively attenuated development of neuropathology and behavioral impairment in young-adult mice but also reversed these indices in aged 3xTgAD mice. Reduced levels of soluble \u03b2-amyloid were also observed by the combination of TSPO ligands Ro5-4864 and PK11195 in nontransgenic mice. These findings suggest that TSPO is a promising target for the development of pleiotropic treatment strategies for the management of AD.", 
    "25": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a manifestation of clinical signs that may result from a variety of liver diseases. In small animals, HE is most commonly a result of portosystemic shunting. The pathogenesis is not completely understood, although it is likely multifactorial. Theories of pathogenesis include altered ammonia metabolism and glutamine and glutamate transmission, an increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists and benzodiazepine-like substances, alterations of the serotonergic system and amino acid metabolism, elevated taurine levels, contributions from inflammatory mediators, and toxic effects of manganese. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms that result in HE may lead to new treatments in the future.", 
    "26": "Antibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are present in many patients with stiff person syndrome and increasingly found in patients with other symptoms indicative of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, such as ataxia. The classic clinical features of stiff person syndrome include muscular stiffness with superimposed painful muscular spasms. Gait is often impaired. Other CNS disorders associated with GAD antibodies include progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), limbic encephalitis, and even epilepsy. Glutamic acid decarboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Presumably, antibodies directed against GAD impair GABA production, but the precise pathogenic mechanism of GAD-antibody-related neurologic disorders is uncertain. Many patients respond to treatment with immunomodulating therapy. Symptomatic treatment with agents that enhance GABA activity, such as benzodiazepines and baclofen, is also helpful for many patients.",

Pharmacological tranquilization is often used as a valid treatment for agitation but a strong evidence base does not underpin it. Available literature shows different recommendations, supported by research data, theoretical considerations, or clinical experience. Rapid tranquilization (RT) is mainly based on parenteral drug treatment and the few existing guidelines on this topic, when suggesting the use of first generation antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, include drugs with questionable tolerability profile such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, midazolam, and lorazepam. In order to systematically evaluate safety concerns related to the adoption of such guidelines, we reviewed them independently from principal diagnosis while examining tolerability data for suggested treatments. There is a growing evidence about safety profile of second generation antipsychotics for RT but further controlled studies providing definitive data in this area are urgently needed.",

One treatment approach to improve daytime symptoms is to consolidate nighttime sleep through decreasing arousals. Sodium oxybate is the first FDA-approved medication that follows this approach. Benzodiazepines are known to also decrease arousals at night and have been proposed to help with sleep fragmentation. In one report, clonazepam was shown to improve cataplexy in 10 of 14 patients with narcolepsy although no improvement in daytime sleepiness was reported.

When developing new drugs, appropriate markers for detecting CYP3A4 induction are needed. Our study compared endogenously formed 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol with the midazolam clearance in plasma and the 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio in urine as markers for CYP3A4 induction. To this end, we performed a clinical trial in which 24 healthy subjects were randomized to 10, 20, or 100 mg daily doses of rifampicin for 14 days (n = 8 in each group) to achieve a low and moderate CYP3A4 induction. The CYP3A4 induction could be detected even at the lowest dose of rifampicin (10 mg) via the estimated midazolam clearance, the 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol ratio (both P < 0.01), and the 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol ratio (P < 0.05). For the three dosing groups (10, 20, and 100 mg), the median fold induction from baseline was 2.0, 2.6, and 4.0 for the estimated midazolam clearance; 1.3, 1.6, and 2.5 for the 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio; and 1.7, 2.9, and 3.1 for the 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio. In conclusion, the 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol ratio is comparable to midazolam clearance as a marker of CYP3A4 induction, and each may be used to evaluate CYP3A4 induction in clinical trials evaluating drug-drug interactions for new drugs.", 
    "34": "Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) can affect the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs by interacting with the metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. To evaluate changes in the activity of CYP3A4 in patients, levels of 1-hydroxymidazolam in plasma are often determined with liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). However, validated LC-MS/MS methods to determine in vitro CYP3A4 inhibition in human liver microsomes are scarce and not optimized for evaluating CYP3A4 inhibition by CAM. The latter is necessary because CAM are often complex mixtures of numerous compounds that can interfere with the selective measurement of 1-hydroxymidazolam. Therefore, the aim was to validate and optimize an LC-MS/MS method for the adequate determination of CYP3A4 inhibition by CAM in human liver microsomes. After incubation of human liver microsomes with midazolam, liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether was applied and dried samples were reconstituted in 50% methanol. These samples were injected onto a reversed-phase chromatography consisting of a Zorbax Extend-C18 column (2.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm, 5.0\u2009\u00b5m particle size), connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. The described LC-MS/MS method was validated over linear range of 1.0-500\u2009nm for 1-hydroxymidazolam. The results revealed good inter-assay accuracy (\u226585% and \u2264115%) and within-day and between-day precisions (coefficient of variation\u2009\u2264\u20094.43%). Furthermore, the applicability of this assay for the determination of CYP3A4 inhibition in complex matrix mixtures was successfully demonstrated in an in vitro experiment in which CYP3A4 inhibition by known CAM (\u03b2-carotene, green tea, milk thistle and St. John's wort) was determined.",

This review focuses on establishing any relevance for clinical drug-drug interaction potential with pomegranate juice, which has been shown to produce therapeutic benefits over a wide range of disease areas. The review collates and evaluates relevant published in vitro, preclinical and clinical evidence of the potential of pomegranate juice to be a perpetrator in drug-drug interactions mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.

Although benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytic agents for short-term use, they should not be given over the long term because of the danger of addiction. Buspirone, an azapirone, was found to be effective in a small number of trials, but the findings across trials are inconsistent. The response rate of GAD to CBT in published studies lies between 47% and 75%, while its response rate to drug treatment lies between 44% and 81%.",

    "49": "Midazolam, a benzodiazepine, has a hypnotic effect and is widely used as an intravenous sedative. Past studies have clearly established that midazolam has beneficial effects in attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury more than other currently used sedative drugs. However, the role of midazolam on chondroprotection via inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is warrant investigation. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms of action of midazolam on MMP expression via nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in activated chondrosarcoma cells maintained in vitro.", 
    "50": "Chondrocytes, SW1353 cells, were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of midazolam (5-20 \u00b5M). Release of MMP-9 into the culture media was determined by gelatin zymography. The expressions of MMP-1, MMP-9 and MMP-13, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 were determined by western blotting assay.",

At concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 \u00b5M, it was significantly inhibited the PMA-induced expressions of MMP-1 (2.27 \u00b10.10, 1.98 \u00b10.11 and 1.56 \u00b10.15; p < 0.001) and MMP-13 (0.89 \u00b10.04, 0.81 \u00b10.07, and 0.74 \u00b10.09; p < 0.001), respectively. Midazolam at concentrations of 10 and 20 \u00b5M for 15 min significantly reversed the rate of degradation (0.895 \u00b10.051; p < 0.05 and 0.926 \u00b10.060; p < 0.01, respectively) of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in PMA-chondrocyte cells. In addition, this sedative drug inhibited PMA-induced levels of phos-ERK (1.243 \u00b10.12, 1.108 \u00b10.16 and 0.903 \u00b10.19, respectively) and phos-p38 (1.146 \u00b10.10, 1.063 \u00b10.13 and 0.946 \u00b10.18, at concentrations of (5, 10 and 20 \u00b5M), respectively.",

This qualitative study aimed at understanding the beliefs and values associated with undue use of benzodiazepines among women. Thirty-three participants (aged between 18 and 60) with a history of undue use of benzodiazepines in the past year were selected intentionally using specific criteria. The interviews were fully transcribed and subjected to content analysis using NVivo software. The majority of respondents reported use for longer than the recommended duration (median 7 years) and they purchased the drug with a medical prescription. Reasons for use most given were to deal with anxiety, to improve sleep and to \"flee from problems.\" Even those who acknowledged the possibility of being addicted were not motivated to stop taking the drug. Medical supervision did not necessarily seem to influence the perception of risk of undue use of benzodiazepines and it appears as a factor favoring the maintenance of prolonged use.",

We report a case of late-onset catatonia associated with enlarged CSP and cavum vergae. A 66-year-old woman was presented with altered mental status and stereotypic movement. She was initially treated with aripiprazole and lorazepam. After 4 weeks, she was treated with electroconvulsive therapy. By 10 treatments, echolalia vanished, and catatonic behavior was alleviated. Developmental anomalies in the midline structure may increase susceptibility to psychosis, even in the elderly.", 
    "55": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for depression. However, the use of concomitant medications during ECT is controversial, especially benzodiazepines, as some past evidence suggests these may reduce the efficacy of ECT. This study analysed the effect of benzodiazepines on treatment outcomes in a group of depressed patients treated with bitemporal (BT) ECT.", 
    "56": "90 patients with major depression who received BT ECT were analysed. Clinical, demographic and ECT data were extracted from clinical records. Mood improvement was rated by trained psychiatrists using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-21) at baseline and after the final ECT treatment. The association between benzodiazepine dose and mood outcomes over the ECT course was examined with regression analyses, controlling for variables that may affect ECT efficacy.",

    "60": "Flumazenil is a specific, reversibly bound antagonist at benzodiazepine binding sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors; these sites can be imaged using positron emission tomography with 11C-flumazenil. We reported an exponential decline of flumazenil volume of distribution (proportional to receptor binding) of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors in children 2 to 17 years. Six newborns (33.3-46.7 weeks' postconception) were studied. All had experienced epileptic seizures and undergone 60-minute dynamic 11C-flumazenil-positron emission tomography imaging after injection of 0.4 mCi/kg of 11C-flumazenil. All newborns were scanned during their natural sleep. Binding potential (indicating flumazenil receptor binding) was calculated using Logan-plot analysis. Visual and quantitative analyses showed highest receptor binding in the amygdala-hippocampus region, sensory-motor cortex, thalamus, brainstem and basal ganglia, in that order. Cerebellum and most of the cerebral cortex showed relatively low binding. This is the first demonstration of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor binding in human neonates and is strikingly different from that in older children/adults, showing a programmed pattern of expression. The ontogeny data of flumazenil receptor binding from children may contribute to understanding regional differences in synaptic plasticity and improve rational therapeutic use of drugs acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor in the pediatric population.", 
    "61": "Myoclonic seizures can be observed in various clinical settings and different epileptic conditions, including some forms of both diopathic and symptomatic epilepsies. Relatively little has been written on treatment of myoclonic seizures. Some old antiepileptic drugs, such as valproate and some benzodiazepines, are widely used but more treatment options exist today for some newer antiepileptic drugs. Nevertheless, patients can be refractory to drug treatment and some drugs may exacerbate or even induce myoclonus.", 
    "62": "Key safety, tolerability, and efficacy data are presented for different antiepileptic drugs with antimyoclonic effect, alone and/or in combination.", 
    "63": "Treatment of myoclonic seizures in children is mainly based on prospective and retrospective studies, with little evidence from randomized clinical trials. Valproate is commonly the first choice alone or in combination with some benzodiazepines or levetiracetam. There is still insufficient evidence for the use of topiramate and zonisamide as monotherapy. Of major importance remains avoidance of medication that may aggravate the seizures. Better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of myoclonic seizures and myoclonic epilepsies could yield great improvement in the treatment and quality of life of patients.", 
    "64": "Channeling occurs when a medication and its potential comparators are selectively prescribed based on differences in underlying patient characteristics. Drug safety advisories can provide new information regarding the relative safety or effectiveness of a drug product which might increase selective prescribing. In particular, when reported adverse effects vary among drugs within a therapeutic class, clinicians may channel patients toward or away from a drug based on the patient's underlying risk for an adverse outcome. If channeling is not identified and appropriately managed it might lead to confounding in observational comparative effectiveness studies.",

Hair analysis showed 15.4% prevalence in illicit drugs (cocaine 12.4%, THC 3.8%, opiates 1%, and ketamine 1%), 22.5% in medicines (methadone 3.3%, benzodiazepines 11%, antidepressants 9.1%, zopiclone 1%, and fentanyl 1.4%), and 3.9% in alcohol. Neonatal abstinence syndrome was developed in 8.1% newborns, all of them from mothers with high methadone-positive hair results (>926.2 pg/mg). Statistically significant lower newborn weight and length were found in neonates from declared smokers compared with nonsmokers (P < 0.05).",

Separation was achieved with a 12-minute linear gradient chromatography on a high-strength silica T3 column at acidic conditions. An in-house database containing 30 compounds from the groups amphetamines, opiates, opioids, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives including 6 deuterated internal standards was built by analyzing solutions from certified standards. Data were extracted using mass accuracy of \u00b1 10 ppm, retention time deviation of \u00b1 0.15 minutes, and area of \u2265 30,000 counts. Identification was based on scoring of retention time, accurate mass measurement, and isotopic pattern. Validation included selectivity, repeatability of analyte area, and the scoring parameters at the proposed thresholds and a method comparison with the present liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry method using 50 authentic hair samples. A daily cutoff calibrator was used to identify positive samples.",

In the EM and IM groups, the concomitant use of hepatic enzyme inducers (phenytoin and carbamazepine) reduced the CD ratio of CLB and increased that of NCLB. In the PM group, these inducers also decreased the CD ratio for CLB but did not elevate the CD ratio for NCLB. Using multiple regression analysis, body weight showed a positive correlation with an increased CD ratio for NCLB. The concomitant use of zonisamide and stiripentol also elevated the CD ratio for NCLB in the EM and IM groups, but that of the PM group was almost unchanged. When the cut-off value of the CD ratio for NCLB was set as 10.0 (\u03bcg/mL)/(mg/kg) for predicting the CYP2C19 PM status, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.4% and 95.7%, respectively.",

Simultaneous polysomnography (PSG) was performed. We compared the zones of obstruction and vibration found with both drugs using the VOTE classification. Simultaneous PSG findings are also compared. There were 15 men and one woman; the mean age was 42.7 years old, mean body mass index 26.9 kg/m(2). Average DISE duration was 20 min with Propofol and 14.3 min with Midazolam. The induced sleep stage obtained was N2 with both drugs. Outpatient physical exam did not correlate with drug-induced sleep findings. There was a good correlation between DISE results with both drugs in all the areas of collapse except the velum (p < 0.005). Using a continuous perfusion, there is a good agreement in the findings observed in DISE performed with propofol and midazolam and PSG.",

This study aimed to evaluate how a low dose of the ketamine/midazolam combination affects the acquisition, consolidation, or recall of a spatial memory task. Thirty-three adult male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four treatment groups: unanesthetized control animals and three groups of animals treated with 40 mg/kg of ketamine and 10mg/kg of midazolam administered in a single intraperitoneal injection. The different treatment groups received the same anesthetic dose at different time points, to study the acquisition, consolidation, and recall of spatial memory in the Y-maze task. The percentage of correct choices was measured. Six mice were killed 4 days and 12 days after anesthesia for histopathological analyses. There were no differences between treatment and control groups regarding the acquisition of spatial memory, measured as the slope of the learning curve, or in the percentage of correct choices in the consolidation or recall periods of the task. Similarly, no differences were detected between groups regarding the number of cells per square millimeter in the visual and retrosplenial cortex, in the dentate gyrus, and in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Hence, a low dose of the ketamine/midazolam combination did not impair memory processes or brain integrity in adult mice, suggesting that this combination is unlikely to cause cognitive complications.",

They include secondary metabolites of alkaloid nature, i.e., ergot alkaloids, diketopiperazines, quinolines, quinazolines, benzodiazepines, and polyketides. We discuss the use of profiles of secondary metabolites for taxonomy purposes. Studying the physicochemical characteristics of producers of biologically active compounds showed that the biosynthesis of alkaloids is initiated on the first days of cultivation and proceeds simultaneously with growth. The cyclic character of alkaloid accumulation was recorded related to the processes of alkaloid biosynthesis, excretion from cells, degradation in culture fluid, and consumption by cells. Synchronic variations in the concentrations of intracellular tryptophan and alkaloids are necessary for the regulation of the optimal quantity of tryptophan necessary for the culture.",

Little is known about the extent of BZ diversion involving distribution points directly related to healthcare sources versus points further down the distribution chain. The present study examines the scope of BZ diversion, and the association between BZ dependence and the direct utilization of particular healthcare-related diversion sources among a diverse sample of prescription drug abusers in South Florida.

Findings suggest that those who are ages 26 to 35 years old, non-Hispanic White participants, private-pay treatment clients, those who are insured, and those with higher incomes had higher odds of utilizing healthcare diversion sources. Those who reported BZ dependence had 2.5 times greater odds of using a healthcare source to obtain BZs than those who did not meet criteria for dependence.",

We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of 2102 consecutive mechanically ventilated ICU patients over an eight-year period at a Melbourne metropolitan hospital with a ten-bed general ICU to determine if propofol was associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) than midazolam. Data were extracted from the hospital administrative database, pharmacy supply order records and ICU database, to calculate rates of MV and tracheostomy, length-of-stay, propofol and midazolam infusion doses, illness severity and casemix and use of 'sedation scores' and 'sedation break' respectively. The primary end-points were duration of MV, tracheostomy rate and hospital outcome. Negative binomial regression and logistic regression were used to identify temporal trends. From 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2010 there were 5751 ICU admissions including 2102 (36.6%) with MV. Over this period there was a 70% decline in annual midazolam use and a greater than fivefold rise in propofol use. 'Sedation scoring' and 'sedation break' procedures were introduced from 2006. Over the eight-year observation period there were significant increases in the numbers of annual MV admissions and long-term (>96 hours) MV patients, but a decline in median duration of MV, tracheostomy rate, median ICU length-of-stay and median hospital length-of-stay. All temporal trends were significant (P <0.05). The temporal association with changes in sedation management practice, including primary sedative agent choice during MV, may explain these findings.",

A sample of 1,293 members of the Association of Public Health Dentists in Sweden were asked to respond to a Web survey concerning dental fear. The response rate was 69% (n = 889); 91% trained in Sweden and 9% trained in another country. The most frequently used pharmacological anxiety-reducing techniques were medication with a midazolame mixture (72%) and benzodiazepine tablets (77%), and the most commonly used psychological techniques were relaxation (68%), distraction (66%), and Tell-Show-Do (86%). A larger proportion of dentists trained in Sweden, compared with dentists who were trained in other countries, reported that they had received undergraduate training in dental fear. Dentists trained in Sweden more often reported competence in pharmacological and psychological anxiety-reducing techniques, compared with dentists who were trained in other countries. Higher levels of self-rated efficacy in treating fearful patients accompanied additional education in dental fear after graduation. In conclusion, Swedish dentists use a variety of techniques to meet the needs of fearful dental patients. Competence in anxiety-reducing techniques is associated with self-efficacy and the site of education.", 
    "102": "In almost 30\u00a0years since the introduction of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), no other class of lipid modulators has entered the market. Elevation of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) via inhibiting cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is an attractive strategy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Transfer of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester (CE) between lipoproteins is mediated by CETP; thus inhibition of this pathway can increase the concentration of HDL-C. Torcetrapib was the first CETP inhibitor evaluated in phase III clinical trials. Because of off-target effects, torcetrapib raised blood pressure and increased the concentration of serum aldosterone, leading to higher cardiovascular events and mortality. Torcetrapib showed positive effects on cardiovascular risk especially in patients with a greater increase in HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) levels. The phase III clinical trial of dalcetrapib, the second CETP inhibitor that has entered clinical development, was terminated because of ineffectiveness. Dalcetrapib is a CETP modulator that elevated HDL-C levels but did not reduce the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Both heterotypic and homotypic CE transfer between lipoproteins are mediated by some CETP inhibitors, including torcetrapib, anacetrapib, and evacetrapib, while dalcetrapib only affects the heterotypic CE transfer. Dalcetrapib has a chemical structure that is distinct from other CETP inhibitors, with a smaller molecular weight and a lack of trifluoride moieties. Moreover, dalcetrapib is a pro-drug that must be hydrolyzed to a pharmacologically active thiol form. Two other CETP inhibitors, anacetrapib and evacetrapib, are currently undergoing evaluation in phase III clinical trials. Both molecules have shown beneficial effects by increasing HDL-C and decreasing LDL-C concentration. The success of anacetrapib and evacetrapib remains to be confirmed upon the completion of phase III clinical trials in 2017 and 2015, respectively. Generally, the concentration of HDL-C has been considered a biomarker for the activity of CETP inhibitors. However, it is not clear whether a fundamental relationship exists between HDL-C levels and the risk of coronary artery diseases. The most crucial role for HDL is cholesterol efflux capacity in which HDL can reverse transport cholesterol from foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques. In view of the heterogeneity in HDL particle size, charge, and composition, the mere concentration of HDL-C may not be a good surrogate marker for HDL functionality. Recent clinical studies have reported that increased HDL functionality inversely correlates with the development of atherosclerotic plaque. Future development of CETP inhibitors may therefore benefit from the use of biomarkers of HDL functionality.",

In some settings the trial could be shorter, considering that evidence of clear improvement with antipsychotics usually occurs within the first two weeks. If the trial of the first antipsychotic cannot be completed due to intolerance, try another until one of the four is tolerated and given an adequate trial. There should be evidence of bioavailability. If the response to this adequate trial is unsatisfactory, try a second monotherapy. If the response to this second adequate trial is also unsatisfactory, and if at least one of the first two trials was with risperidone, olanzapine, or a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic, then clozapine is recommended for the third trial. If neither trial was with any these three options, a third trial prior to clozapine should occur, using one of those three. If the response to monotherapy with clozapine (with dose adjusted by using plasma levels) is unsatisfactory, consider adding risperidone, lamotrigine, or ECT.

In this paper, we have identified and characterized a functional myopia-associated gene using a specific mouse-knockout model. Mice lacking the muscarinic cholinergic receptor gene (M2; also known as Chrm2) were less susceptible to lens-induced myopia compared with wild-type mice, which showed significantly increased axial length and vitreous chamber depth when undergoing experimental induction of myopia. The key findings of this present study are that the sclera of M2 mutant mice has higher expression of collagen type I and lower expression of collagen type V than do wild-type mice and mice that are mutant for other muscarinic subtypes, and, therefore, M2 mutant mice were resistant to the development of experimental myopia. Pharmacological blockade of M2 muscarinic receptor proteins retarded myopia progression in the mouse.

In this study, the UGT responsible for sipoglitazar was retrospectively identified by in vitro analysis. A study using UGT-expressing supersomes revealed that sipoglitazar glucuronidation was more extensively catalyzed by UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 2B4, and 2B15 than by other UGTs. Enzyme kinetic studies for sipoglitazar glucuronidation and recent findings related to mRNA expression analysis of UGTs narrowed the involved isoforms down to UGT1A1 and UGT2B15 among these five human UGTs. In a correlation study between sipoglitazar glucuronidation and UGT isoform-specific activities, the glucuronidation of S-oxazepam, a specific substrate for UGT2B15, strongly correlated with that of sipoglitazar, as compared with that of \u03b2-estradiol, a representative UGT1A1 substrate. The analysis of the species difference strengthens the possibility of UGT2B15 rather than that of UGT1A1. These in vitro findings indicate that UGT2B15 is principally responsible for sipoglitazar glucuronidation. Moreover, the UGT2B15*2 mutation significantly increased the Km value of sipoglitazar in the kinetic analysis using recombinant His-tag UGT2B15*1- or *2-membrane fractions.

When bromosulfophthalein (BSP) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which were used as model substrates for Oatps, were administered intravenously (3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively) to rats pretreated with rifampicin orally (30 mg/kg), the total plasma clearance of BSP and statins was attenuated compared with that in control rats, suggesting the involvement of Oatps in the disposition of these drugs in vivo.

The involvement of Oatps in the disposition of statins observed in vivo was further clarified by employing an in vitro hepatic uptake study and media-loss assay in the presence or absence of 100 \u03bcM rifampicin. Hepatic intrinsic clearance was reduced in the presence of rifampicin in both the media-loss assay and hepatocyte uptake study.

    "161": "Treatment with second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), notably olanzapine and clozapine, causes severe obesity side effects. Antagonism of histamine H1 receptors has been identified as a main cause of SGA-induced obesity, but the molecular mechanisms associated with this antagonism in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain remain unclear. This review aims to explore the potential role of hypothalamic histamine H1 receptors in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain/obesity and the molecular pathways related to SGA-induced antagonism of these receptors. Initial data have demonstrated the importance of hypothalamic H1 receptors in both short- and long-term SGA-induced obesity. Blocking hypothalamic H1 receptors by SGAs activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a well-known feeding regulator. During short-term treatment, hypothalamic H1 receptor antagonism by SGAs may activate the AMPK-carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 signaling to rapidly increase caloric intake and result in weight gain. During long-term SGA treatment, hypothalamic H1 receptor antagonism can reduce thermogenesis, possibly by inhibiting the sympathetic outflows to the brainstem rostral raphe pallidus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, therefore decreasing brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Additionally, blocking of hypothalamic H1 receptors by SGAs may also contribute to fat accumulation by decreasing lipolysis but increasing lipogenesis in white adipose tissue. In summary, antagonism of hypothalamic H1 receptors by SGAs may time-dependently affect the hypothalamus-brainstem circuits to cause weight gain by stimulating appetite and fat accumulation but reducing energy expenditure. The H1 receptor and its downstream signaling molecules could be valuable targets for the design of new compounds for treating SGA-induced weight gain/obesity.",

These products may contain a wide variety of active ingredients such as heavy metals, hydroquinone, and corticosteroids that can be highly toxic, especially after prolonged application. For decades, there have been case reports of both corticosteroid and heavy metal toxicity related to skin-lightening cream use. We report a case of a child who developed status epilepticus after ingesting a skin-lightening solution containing 2% hydroquinone.

    "163": "There is a growing body of evidence that soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the importance of soluble A\u03b2 oligomers as a therapeutic target for AD, the dynamic metabolism of these A\u03b2 species in vivo has not been elucidated because of the difficulty in monitoring brain A\u03b2 oligomers in living animals. Here, using a unique large pore-sized membrane microdialysis, we characterized soluble A\u03b2 oligomers in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of awake, freely moving APP/PS1 transgenic and control WT mice. We could detect high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) A\u03b2 oligomers in the brain ISF of living animals, which increased dramatically in an age-dependent manner (5- to 8-fold increase, 4 vs. 17-18 mo). Notably, HMW A\u03b2 decreased more slowly than other forms of A\u03b2 after acute \u03b3-secretase inhibition [% decrease from the baseline (HMW vs. LMW) was 36.9 vs. 74.1% (A\u03b240, P<0.05) and 25.4 vs. 88.0% (A\u03b242, P<0.01)], suggesting that HMW A\u03b2 oligomers clear more slowly than other forms from the brain. These data reveal the dynamic metabolism of neurotoxic A\u03b2 oligomers in AD brain and could provide new insights into A\u03b2-targeted therapies for AD.", 
    "164": "Adolescence is a time of physical and mental development when small changes can impact on the rest of a person's life. Substance use in this crucial period can have long-lasting consequences for the individual and for society. The prevalence of substance use in young people is an area of concern for policy makers and health workers. This systematic review looked at prevalence for four substances: alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and benzodiazepines, across the Republic of Ireland for persons between the ages of 13 and 24, and compared usage between 2000 and 2012. Eighteen articles were included in the review. It was seen that tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use has fallen in the lifetime and previous month use. The level of benzodiazepine use has remained similar in the period of study. Future work should redress the imbalance in substance use research that sees the majority of researchers looking at a few substances while little work is done on the others.", 
    "165": "Antidepressant agents such as fluoxetine have been shown to produce neurogenic effects involving transcriptional and translational changes that direct molecular and cellular plasticity. These cellular and molecular events appear necessary to mediate the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine and may be generated through the ability for fluoxetine to regulate BDNF levels. Clinically, benzodiazepines are frequently used in combination with standard antidepressants both for initial treatment and maintenance therapy, especially when comorbid anxiety is present. However, very little is known regarding the consequence of combined treatment of benzodiazepines and antidepressant on the development of clinical effect. The current study therefore examined the effect of co-administration of fluoxetine and the benzodiazepine, diazepam, on hippocampal neurogenesis in the social isolation rodent model of chronic stress. We demonstrate that 9 weeks of social isolation induces a deficit in motivational behaviour with increased anxiety as well as impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis. This was parallelled by reduced BDNF levels in the hippocampus. While treatment with fluoxetine alone for 3 weeks restored anxiety behaviour as well as progenitor cell proliferation and the generation of new hippocampal neurons, this effect was prevented by co-administration with diazepam. This suggests that co-administering benzodiazepines with antidepressants could significantly delay or prevent the cellular and behavioural improvement needed by patients. These findings indicate the need for future clinical studies designed to investigate the combined effects of benzodiazepines and antidepressants in patients.", 
    "166": "The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO; also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)) is evolutionarily conserved and is found mainly in the outer membrane of the mitochondria of steroid-synthesizing tissues, including the brain (1). Although the TSPO is involved in neuroinflammation and axonal regeneration after brain injury (2), the best characterized function of this protein is the transport of cholesterol from the outer membrane of the mitochondria to the inner membrane of these organelles, where it is used for steroid and neurosteroid hormone synthesis (2). Very low levels of TSPO are expressed in healthy brain tissue, but, in the event of an injury, the protein is overexpressed at the site of injury (3) both in the peripheral nervous system (in Schwann cells, macrophages, and neurons) and in the central nervous system (in activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages) (1). In addition, TSPO is overexpressed in different types of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, stroke, and various cancers, including those of the brain (3), but the expression of this protein is downregulated in psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder (1). Because the TSPO density is altered during neuronal injury or disease, it has been suggested that TSPO may serve as a biomarker of neuroinflammation and may be used to determine the efficacy of drugs used to monitor the progression and treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases (3). Several TSPO-selective ligands with diverse chemical structures have been synthesized, radiolabeled with (11)C or (18)F, and evaluated with positron emission tomography (PET) for the noninvasive imaging of this receptor in the brain of various species of animals (mouse, rat, and monkey) (4). For a detailed discussion of the chemistry of different TSPO ligands, see Dolle et al. (3). It is not clear, however, how the labeled ligands interact with the TSPO, and much is unknown about the changes that take place within this protein during neuroinflammation and related disorders (5). [(11)C]PK11195 targets TSPO and is commonly used with PET for the imaging of neurological disorders, but its uptake in the brain can be difficult to quantify because the tracer has high lipophilicity and exhibits high nonspecific binding (6). Much effort has been devoted to develop and screen new tracers that can be used for the imaging and quantification of TSPO (such as [(11)C]DAA1106, [(18)F]DAA1106, [(18)F]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]PBR28, etc.) (4, 6). However, these radioligands have to be synthesized with multi-step procedures, and all of them are still under investigation for use in animals (4). Using a single-step procedure, Damont et al. synthesized N-(6-[(18)F]fluoro-4-phenoxypyridin-3-yl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)acetamide (6-[(18)F]Fluoro-PBR28), a radiofluorinated derivative of PBR28, studied its characteristics in vitro, and evaluated the tracer for the imaging of TSPO in the rat brain (4).",

We examined the effects of acute chlordiazepoxide and d-amphetamine injections on the behavior of two groups of pigeons trained on a three-component multiple schedule with identical schedules of reinforcement in the first and last components. For one group of pigeons reinforcement was unavailable during the middle component (decreased-middle-component).

In the decreased-middle-component group, chlordiazepoxide (3.2-32\u2009mg/kg) decreased third-component response rates less than it decreased responding in the first component. Conversely, in the increased-middle-component group, chlordiazepoxide (3.2-10\u2009mg/kg) decreased third-component response rates more than in the first component.

    "223": "Breast implant procedures are commonly performed using general anesthesia; however, patient apprehension, the potential for improved safety, lower costs, and faster recovery times have increased interest in the use of conscious sedation in plastic surgery. The authors examined the safety and efficacy of breast implant procedures performed under conscious sedation over a 6-year period using their standardized institutional protocol.", 
    "224": "Between 2002 and 2008, 461 consecutive patients underwent breast implant procedures under conscious sedation using a protocol of preoperative intravenous diazepam along with intraoperative midazolam, fentanyl, and local anesthetic. All operative and follow-up data were recorded. Augmentation mammaplasty patients were further analyzed for conscious sedation medication dosing.", 
    "225": "The study population was divided into two groups (years 1 to 3 and years 4 to 6 of the study period) to analyze changes to the authors' regimen over time. In years 4 to 6, higher preoperative doses of diazepam (p = 0.01) allowed more effective local anesthesia administration, thereby reducing intraoperative fentanyl requirements (p < 0.0001). Midazolam doses and operating times did not differ significantly between groups. No patient required conversion to a deeper method of anesthesia. The overall complication rate was 4.34 percent.", 
    "226": "The authors' study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of conscious sedation in breast implant procedures. Higher preoperative doses of diazepam have significantly reduced fentanyl requirements, resulting in shorter recovery times, decreased postoperative nausea/vomiting, and elimination of unintended admissions. These benefits are obtained without increasing operative times or complications. The authors conclude that conscious sedation is the preferred method of anesthesia for most patients undergoing breast implant procedures.", 
    "227": "While acetylcholine (ACh) and muscarinic receptors in the bladder are mainly known for their role in the regulation of smooth muscle contractility, in other tissues they are involved in tissue remodelling and promote cell growth and proliferation. In the present study we have used primary cultures of human detrusor smooth muscle cells (HDSMCs), in order to investigate the role of muscarinic receptors in HDSMC proliferation. Samples were obtained as discarded tissue from men >65 years undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and cut in pieces that were either immediately frozen or placed in culture medium for the cell culture establishment. HDSMCs were isolated from samples, propagated and maintained in culture. [(3)H]-QNB radioligand binding on biopsies revealed the presence of muscarinic receptors, with a Kd of 0.10\u00b10.02nM and a Bmax of 72.8\u00b10.1fmol/mg protein. The relative expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes, based on Q-RT-PCR, was similar in biopsies and HDSMC with a rank order of M2\u2265M3>M1>M4>M5. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh, 1-100\u03bcM) concentration-dependently increased [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation (up to 46\u00b14%). This was concentration-dependently inhibited by the general muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and by subtype-preferring antagonists with an order of potency of darifenacin >4-DAMP>AF-DX 116. The CCh-induced cell proliferation was blocked by selective PI-3 kinase and ERK activation inhibitors, strongly suggesting that these intracellular pathways mediate, at least in part, the muscarinic receptor-mediated cell proliferation. This work shows that M2 and M3 receptors can mediate not only HDSM contraction but also proliferation; they may also contribute bladder remodelling including detrusor hypertrophy.", 
    "228": "Mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. This enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. Several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11\u03b2-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. Similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin D. The access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. StAR action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Components of this machine include the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion chanel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1\u03b1 (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.", 
    "229": "Falling is one the most common types of inpatient adverse events. Most fall-related research was conducted retrospectively and focused on elderly population in general hospital settings. This study aimed to timely identify all potential risk factors associated with falls and fall-related injury in a psychiatric inpatient setting. We recruited 145 fall events and 145 sex- and room-matched psychiatric control inpatients without fall in a 1002-bed psychiatric teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. In addition to medical records, the study variables included patient characteristics, circumstances and medications, which were collected from the patients and/or their families within 24\u00a0h of receiving reports right after obtaining written informed consent. A psychiatrist and three head nurses conducted a comprehensive assessment of risk factors immediately after falls occurred. A conditional logistic regression model revealed four variables significantly associated with an increased risk of falling: the clinical global impression-severity (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)\u00a0=\u00a02.19; 95% confidence interval, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.13-4.24), the parkinsonism scores of the extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.14; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08-1.21), equivalent dosage of benzodiazepines use (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.15; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03-1.30), and medication changes within 24\u00a0h (aOR\u00a0=\u00a010.3; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.37-76.8). Acute settings (aORs\u00a0=\u00a02.06, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01-4.18), a fall history in the past six months and a lack of history of medical problems (aORs\u00a0=\u00a03.04; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.46-6.33) were associated with fall-related injury (aOR\u00a0=\u00a02.70; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.29-5.69). Our study identified the severity of psychotic symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, medications usage and other several specific measures for prevention of falls in psychiatric inpatient settings."
