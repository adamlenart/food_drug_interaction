    "0": "The DS19 Friend erythroleukemia cells possess peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites that are similar to those characterized in other tissues and cells. These sites recognize only specific and well-defined ligand structures. In order for the benzodiazepines to bind to these sites, an alkyl group of 3 carbons or less is required at position 1, together with a carbonyl group at position 2. In addition, the binding affinity is enhanced by 4'-halogen or 4'-methoxy substituents, and by 7- or 2'-halogens. However, the affinity is decreased by substitutions at position 3 or 4. Central-type benzodiazepine binding in brain, on the other hand, is not affected by 1-alkyl groups and is inhibited by 4'-substitutions. Furthermore, unlike the peripheral-type site, the brain receptor is stereo-selective. These results demonstrate that the two binding sites are fundamentally different in their recognition of benzodiazepine ligands.", 
    "1": "t- Butylbicyclophosphorothionate ( TBPS ), a derivative of potent GABA antagonistic cage convulsants, has recently been introduced ( Squires , R. F., J.E. Casida , M. Richardson, and E. Saederup (1983) Mol. Pharmacol. 13:326-336) as ligand for a GABA-A receptor-linked drug receptor. Using conventionally prepared washed membrane fractions from rat cerebral cortex, we have confirmed that in the presence of 200 mM NaBr [35S] TBPS binds to a high affinity population of binding sites (Kd 26 +/- 5 nM) and that muscimol inhibits [35S] TBPS binding (IC50 0.32 microM) allosterically. In 200 mM NaCl the apparent affinity of [35S] TBPS binding sites is lower (Kd 60 +/- 5 nM), and muscimol has biphasic effects with stimulation at low concentrations of muscimol (EC50 0.023 microM) followed by inhibition at high concentrations (IC50 0.72 microM). Both base line [35S] TBPS binding (in 200 mM NaCl) and muscimol inhibition of [35S] TBPS binding (in 200 mM NaBr) are bidirectionally modulated by the occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors with its ligands. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists, regardless of their structure, enhance and inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonists inhibit base line [35S] TBPS binding and muscimol inhibition of [35S] TBPS binding. Fourteen ligands for benzodiazepine receptors display a similar in vitro profile as benzodiazepine receptor agonists or inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonists on [35S] TBPS binding as their anti- or proconvulsive effects in vivo suggest (Jensen, L. H., E. N. Petersen, and C. Braestrup (1983) Life Sci. 33: 393-399). That [35S] TBPS binding sites are constituents of a GABA benzodiazepine receptor complex is also suggested by a number of membrane pretreatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The differences in the pharmacological effects of R(+)- and S(-)-isomers of the atypical antidepressant viloxazin were discovered in two behavioral models. The S(-)-isomer appeared 5 times as active as the R(+)-isomer under acute administration. In chronic administration, (15 days), the R(+)-isomer appeared ineffective. Comparison of the affinity of the racemate, R(+) and S(-)-isomers for alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoreceptors, as well as for serotonin, C1, benzodiazepine, imipramine and dopamine receptors did not demonstrate any stereospecificity of viloxazin isomers. It is assumed that some other receptors (histamine, acetylcholine) present the targets for the pharmacological action of viloxazin or the latter one has, like zimelidin , specific binding sites of its own.", 
    "3": "Several beta-carbolines, isoquinolines, imidazopyridines , and canthin -6-ones prepared in biomimetic fashion were tested for their ability to bind to the benzodiazepine receptor. Methyl isoquinoline-3-carboxylate, methyl 6,7- dimethoxyisoquinoline -3-carboxylate (3b) 1-phenyl-3- carbomethoxyimidazopyridine , (6B,) and canthin -6- one ( 13a ) bound with moderate affinities, while 2- carbomethoxycanthin -6- one ( 13b ) bound to benzodiazepine receptors with an affinity comparable to several pharmacologically active benzodiazepines. The potency of 13b suggests that the benzodiazepine receptor(s) can tolerate substitution at positions 1 and 9 of a beta-carboline without loss of activity if the substituents are trigonal and maintain a planar topography. Moreover, displacement of the carbonyl group by two atoms from the aromatic ring (C) of the beta-carboline skeleton caused a marked decrease in binding to the benzodiazepine receptor. This observation supports the hypothesis that maximum binding affinity of beta-carbolines is achieved when the carbonyl group at position 3 is attached directly to the aromatic pyridine ring.", 
    "4": "In unwashed brain membranes taurine produced an inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FNZ) binding with IC50 ranging between 31.5 and 11.9 microM; the IC20 varied between 18 and 26 nM. This inhibitory effect was of a mixed type, with a reduction in Bmax and an increase in KD. Various precursors and metabolites of taurine have a less inhibitory effect. Taurine also has little inhibitory effect (IC50 above 500 microM) on the binding of [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. In extensively washed membranes, 10(-5) M taurine produces a 16-21% increase in the binding of [3H]FNZ while 10(-5) M gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increases it between 31 and 42%. However, if 10(-5) M GABA plus 10(-5) M taurine is included in the assay there is a dramatic inhibitory effect. Taurine causes an inhibition of the GABAergic enhancement of [3H]FNZ binding with an IC50 between 7.3 and 7.8 microM. Binding experiments with [3H]taurine done under different conditions failed to detect a Na+-independent and specific [3H]taurine receptor. These results suggest that endogenous taurine, the second most abundant free amino acid in brain, may play an important modulatory role in the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "5": "The [14C]2-deoxy-D-glucose technique has been applied to examine glucose utilization rate (GUR), as a measure of neuronal activity, of 42 cerebral nuclei, hypophysis and adrenals in male Wistar rats. Restraint and water-immersed stress for a 10 min period significantly increased GUR in the cortex frontalis, nucleus (n.) amygdaloideus centralis and lateralis, n. ventromedialis, substantia nigra, n. reticularis lateralis, n. ambiguus, lobus anterior of hypophysis, and adrenals. The elevation was predominant in the n. amygdaloideus centralis, n. ambiguus and lobus anterior of hypophysis. Bromazepam significantly prevented these elevations at the non-muscle relaxant dose of 1 mg/kg, p.o. Further prolongation (55 min) of stress caused a marked and non-selective increase of GUR in all cerebral nuclei and glands examined. In spontaneously hypertensive rats in the conscious, resting state, the pretreatment with bromazepam (3 mg/kg, p.o.) abolished the stress-induced pressor response and the release of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine beta-hydroxylase into the circulation. These results suggest that the n. amygdaloideus centralis is mostly a sensitive site to stress and one of the major action sites of bromazepam.", 
    "6": "Interactions of cholinesterase inhibitors or dexamethasone with the hypnotic effect of benzodiazepines appear to be strongly dependent on the dose of the cholinesterase inhibitor used and to a lesser extent on the dose of the hypnotic. The duration of the loss of righting reflex caused by the benzodiazepines, diazepam or chlorodiazepoxide, is markedly prolonged by 500 micrograms/kg, significantly antagonized both diazepam and chlorodiazepoxide. Relatively higher doses of physostigmine have no significant effect on either diazepam or chlorodiazepoxide. Dexamethasone, in relatively low doses of 250 and 500 micrograms/kg or 500 micrograms/kg respectively, significantly reverses the effect of diazepam and chlorodiazepoxide, while in relatively high doses of 1000 micrograms/kg the hormone significantly potentiates the hypnosis produced by the benzodiazepines. It is suggested that the interactions described may be the result of a modification of possible changes in cholinergic activity caused by the benzodiazepines. Although as yet no unequivocal explanation can be offered for the different effects, the observations described in this paper may explain the highly contradictory findings of other authors in both animal and human studies.", 
    "7": "In chronic schizophrenic patients treated with phenothiazines (Chlorpromazine, Levomepromazine, Perphenazine) for long periods (average = 8 years), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower (P less than 0.001) compared with normal controls. The HDL subfractions showed that HDL3-C was significantly low (P less than 0.005) whereas HDL2-C was not. Both serum apo A-I and apo A-II levels were also low (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.001, respectively) in schizophrenics treated with phenothiazines. The serum triglycerides (TG) level was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in patients treated with phenothiazines than in controls. No significant differences in total cholesterol (TC), TG and HDL-C were found between users and nonusers of benzodiazepine in schizophrenic patients receiving phenothiazines. In addition to chronic schizophrenic patients, 8 new patients with schizophrenia and related diseases were studied. The serum HDL-C level decreased by 24% within 1 week following administration of phenothiazines. No significant differences were found in TC and TG levels for 10 weeks after initiation of phenothiazine administration.", 
    "8": "Outpatient sedation of infants, uncooperative children and, rarely, adults provides an opportunity to perform certain ophthalmologic diagnostic procedures such as tonometry, ophthalmoscopy and various electrophysiological studies (e.g., electroretinography and visual evoked response testing) without the expense and usage of an operating room. Many drugs have been recommended and used; all have limitations. The advantages and disadvantages of the more commonly used agents are reviewed. The known effects of these drugs on ocular function are presented.", 
    "9": "Recent reports suggest that antagonists of benzodiazepine receptors have intrinsic anxiogenic and convulsant properties. An exploratory model in the mouse, specific for anxiolytics, was employed to test further, the hypothesis that antagonists have intrinsic actions pharmacologically opposite to those of the benzodiazepines. The drugs Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidiazo -[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate), CGS-8216 (2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c] quinolin -3[5H]one), beta-CCM (3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline) and FG-7142 (N1-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) all effectively blocked the anxiolytic actions of diazepam. None of these antagonists demonstrated intrinsic or anxiogenic or anxiolytic activity in this model system. These findings suggest that both the species and paradigm employed will determine the pharmacological profile of drugs which act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "10": "During phenazepam oxidation by rat, mouse and rabbit liver microsomes, the maximal amount of products was formed if NADP-H was used as electron donor. Addition of equimolar concentration of NAD-H did not stimulate phenazepam oxidation. The monooxygenase inhibitor, SKF-525A, reduced the rate of phenazepam oxidation depending on the type of experimental animals. The mechanisms of enzymatic formation from phenazepam of 3-hydroxymetabolite, quinazoline and aromatic hydroxylation products are discussed.", 
    "11": "The development of toxic and traumatic brain edema in rats is accompanied by a decrease in the ATP level, in the total amount of adenyl nucleotides, the magnitude of the energy charge in the ATP-ADP-AMP system, and by an elevation in the content of AMP. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) and phenibut (50 mg/kg) that exert an antiedematous action reduce the amplitude of bioenergetic shifts during edema. As for piracetam (1000 mg/kg) it exhibits an insignificant effect. It is assumed that positive action of diazepam and phenibut on brain bioenergetics in edema is realized via the GABA-ergic system.", 
    "12": "Several studies investigating changes with time in pharmacokinetic parameters of several benzodiazepines are reviewed. At least 3 possibilities (enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition by metabolic products, and unchanged kinetics following long term therapy or high doses) have been postulated in the disposition processes of diazepam. It seems likely that the contradictory results which have been reported can be explained by differences in 1 or several experimental factors influencing the outcome of a study (patient compliance, multiple drug therapy or statistical design). With the 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine lorazepam and the nitro-benzodiazepine nitrazepam, no changes in metabolic activity were observed. Studies with clonazepam in monkeys have confirmed previous observations that reduced metabolic activity during periods of physical inactivity gives rise to circadian fluctuations in steady-state concentrations of the drug. Furthermore, systemic and intrinsic clearances of midazolam were found to be higher following an intravenous dose in the late afternoon than after a morning dose. The protein binding of diazepam is also subject to diurnal variations, and concomitant changes in apparent volume of distribution and clearance have been observed. From the existing data it seems likely that the rate of absorption of several benzodiazepines (including diazepam, clobazam and clorazepate) varies periodically with a 24-hour cycle, pointing to diurnal effects on drug absorption processes.", 
    "13": "Adverse reactions were evaluated from 45 double-blind controlled clinical trials involving triazolam 0.25 mg (N = 731), triazolam 0.5 mg (N = 2004), flurazepam 30 mg (N = 899), and placebo (N = 1771). Excessive CNS depression was the most frequent adverse effect, reported in 14.2% of trials with triazolam 0.25 mg, 19.5% with triazolam 0.5 mg, 23.9% with flurazepam 30 mg, and 6.4% with placebo. With the exception of orolingual complaints associated with flurazepam, all other categories of adverse reactions were equally or more frequent with placebo than with active medications. Unusual or excessive adverse reactions were not reported.", 
    "14": "Clobazam 20 mg, diazepam 10 mg, lorazepam 2 mg and oxazepam 30 mg were compared in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial as oral premedication for 150 patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. All drugs and placebo significantly decreased anxiety when assessed by the patient on a 10-cm linear analogue rating scale 60 min after premedication. Diazepam 10 mg induced significantly more drowsiness when assessed by a trained observer 60 min after premedication than clobazam 20 mg, oxazepam 30 mg and placebo (P less than 0.01). Lorazepam 2 mg caused significantly more drowsiness 2 h (P less than 0.001) and 4 h (P less than 0.01) after operation, and significantly impaired psychomotor function after operation compared with the other four agents. The data suggest that clobazam 20 mg, diazepam 10 mg, oxazepam 30 mg or placebo offer advantages over lorazepam 2 mg for oral premedication in minor gynaecological surgery where early discharge after operation is preferred.", 
    "15": "Because of the anxiety accompanying his obsessions and a prior panic attack, an obsessive-compulsive man was given alprazolam, which reduced his obsessions and eliminated his compulsions. The authors discuss links between obsessive-compulsive disorder and other psychiatric disorders.", 
    "16": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mammalian brain, can induce coma. Outside the central nervous system it is synthesized by gut bacteria and catabolized largely in the liver. GABA and its agonists, as well as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, induce neural inhibition as a consequence of their interaction with specific binding sites for each of these classes of neuroactive substances on the GABA receptor complex of postsynaptic neurons. In a rabbit model of acute liver failure: (i) the pattern of postsynaptic neuronal activity in hepatic coma, as assessed by visual evoked potentials, is identical to that associated with coma induced by drugs which activate the GABA neurotransmitter system (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and GABA agonists); (ii) the levels of GABA-like activity in peripheral blood plasma increase appreciably before the onset of hepatic encephalopathy, due at least in part to impaired hepatic extraction of gut-derived GABA from portal venous blood; (iii) the blood-brain barrier becomes abnormally permeable to an isomer of GABA, alpha-amino-isobutyric acid, before the onset of hepatic encephalopathy; and (iv) hepatic coma is associated with an increase in the density of receptors for GABA and benzodiazepines in the brain. These findings are the bases of the following hypotheses: (i) when the liver fails, gut-derived GABA in plasma crosses an abnormally permeable blood-brain barrier and by mediating neural inhibition contributes to hepatic encephalopathy; (ii) an increased number of GABA receptors in the brain found in liver failure increases the sensitivity of the brain to GABA-ergic neural inhibition; and (iii) an increased number of drug binding sites mediates the increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and barbiturates observed in liver failure by permitting increased drug effect.", 
    "17": "Plasma beta-endorphin, pain and anxiety were measured in patients before, during, and 1 and 3 hours following oral surgery. Diazepam and fentanyl blocked the stress induced increase in plasma beta-endorphin experienced by patients administered placebo. Moreover, intra-operative anxiety and post-operative pain appear to constitute independent and possibly equipotent stimuli for release of pituitary beta-endorphin in humans.", 
    "18": "Human cerebrospinal fluid was chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4. Fractions containing material with molecular weights less than 4000 Dalton were pooled and further fractionated by high pressure liquid chromatography on an UltroPack TSK column G 2000 SW. At least three peaks, which were free of salt and GABA, were shown to displace (3H)-diazepam in the receptor-binding assay. Two of these peaks inhibited diazepam-binding competitively as shown by Lineweaver-Burke and displacement analysis. Their activity could be enhanced by the addition of GABA to the assay mixture. Incubation of these two peaks with various enzymes indicated that at least part of the activity of the second peak is due to a peptide.", 
    "19": "Binding activity for the cage convulsant [35S]-tert- butylbicyclophosphorothionate , which appears to label a site closely associated with the chloride ionophore of the GABAA /benzodiazepine receptor complex has been solubilized from rat cerebral cortex using the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS . Of several detergents screened, only CHAPS and CHAPSO were capable of solubilizing the binding activity with good recovery. The pharmacologic specificity of soluble [35S]-tert- butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding is very similar to the membrane state. In both the membrane and soluble state, [35S]-tert- butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding is enhanced by anions which support inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (\" Eccles anions\"), suggesting that [35S]-t- butylbicyclophosphorothionate may label chloride channels though to be involved in these potentials. Since this solubilization procedure also preserves GABA and benzodiazepine binding and their regulation by drugs such as barbiturates, purification and isolation of the macromolecular complex including chloride channel and GABA-benzodiazepine sites may be feasible.", 
    "20": "A study has been carried out on 20 male patients affected by gastric and duodenal ulcer disease and undergoing pharmacological treatment with pirenzepine, cimetidine, carbenoxolone and zolimidine in a multicentre controlled clinical trial, on PRL, TSH, FSH, LH plasma levels, taking into account the circadian rhythms of these endocrine variables. Basal and follow-up tests have been carried out, as well as a stimulation tests with TRH and LHRH. The findings do not allow for definite conclusions: two patients have shown moderate increases in the PRL levels after cimetidine; all patients have shown optimum responses to the stimulation test.", 
    "21": "The objective of this investigation was to determine whether the effects of muscimol on benzodiazepine receptor binding relate to the hypnotic activity of nine benzodiazepines (clonazepam, triazolam, diazepam, flurazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, clobazam, and chlordiazepoxide) and CL 218,872. There was no correlation between the basal receptor binding affinities of the drugs tested and their hypnotic potencies, whereas the benzodiazepine receptor agonists whose receptor bindings are strongly modulated by muscimol possess potent hypnotic activity. These results indicate that benzodiazepine receptors that couple to GABA receptors are involved in the hypnotic activity of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "22": "Binding of [3H]PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, was measured in microdissected tubule segments of rat nephron. High specific binding capacities (1.1-1.8 fmol X mm-1) were found in the thick ascending limb of the Henle's loop and in the collecting tubule, whereas specific binding could not be detected in the proximal tubule. In the medullary collecting tubule, the association and dissociation rate constants at 4 degrees C were k1 = 3.0 X 10(6) M-1 X min-1 and k-1 = 0.021 min -1; the ratio k-1/k1 = 7.0 nM was in agreement with the estimated equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd = 2.4 nM). [3H]PK 11195 binding sites from medullary ascending limb and medullary collecting tubule revealed the following sequence of specificity: PK 11195 = Ro 5-4864 much greater than clonazepam, indicating that tubule binding sites might be the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors of the rat kidney.", 
    "23": "A high correlation between fear and analgesia classically conditioned to footshock in rats has been reported in the literature. However, it has never been directly tested whether or not fear is in fact causal to the production of conditioned analgesia. We therefore tested whether conditioned analgesia could be elicited in the absence of fear by employing two independent methods of fear suppression. First, areas of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) previously implicated in fear were selectively lesioned. Lesions of the dorsolateral PAG significantly attenuated conditioned analgesia and markedly decreased fear responses. Second, fear was attenuated via administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Rats which had been conditioned while in the presence of CDP showed no reduction in conditioned pain inhibition. These results demonstrate that: (1) fear is not causal to classically conditioned analgesia and (2) the anatomical substrates for fear and conditioned analgesia are distinct but partially overlapping. The fact that fear is not a critical antecedent for classically conditioned analgesia suggests that classical conditioning techniques may be applied clinically to increase the effectiveness of some analgesic manipulations.", 
    "24": "Acute hyperventilation (HV) rarely poses diagnostic or therapeutic problems. Chronic hyperventilation, however, with vague and multiple symptomatology due to respiratory alkalosis and increased breathing work, is often overlooked or misinterpreted, though it is a very common disorder of the general patient population. Chronic HV is frequently associated with emotional disturbances such as anxiety, panic and depression, or with psychosomatic disorders such as irritable bowel, effort syndrome and chronic pain. The diagnosis of chronic HV relies primarily on taking of a thorough history and is confirmed by an HV provocation test and arterial or cutaneous measurements of pCO2. Therapeutic measurements include psychotherapy, psychoactive drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines), beta-blockers and modification of abnormal breathing patterns.", 
    "25": "Baboons were exposed to diazepam via continuous injection at doses of 0.125-20.0 mg/kg per day intragastrically (i.g.) for 7 days or to 20 mg/kg per day, i.g. for 1 h or 1 to 35 days. After diazepam administration, Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist was given (5.0 mg/kg i.m.) and precipitated benzodiazepine withdrawal was evaluated by scoring individual signs. The severity of the withdrawal, as indicated by the number of the different signs as well as by frequency of individual signs, increased as the dose and duration of diazepam exposure were increased. Consistent elevations in diazepam withdrawal signs were evident after a dose as low as 0.25 mg/kg per day for 7 days and after administration of 20 mg/kg per day for as short as 3-7 days. Data also suggested that history of previous benzodiazepine exposure sensitized animals to subsequent development of physical dependence. Overall, this study suggests that benzodiazepines produce meaningful functional changes in the central nervous system after exposure to relatively low doses and after relatively short durations of exposure.", 
    "26": "The involvement of noradrenergic processes in both the behavioral suppression and release of food intake induced by diazepam, was investigated using the novelty-induced inhibition of food consumption model. Clonidine (7.5-60 micrograms/kg i.p.) and another alpha 2-noradrenergic receptor agonist, guanfacine (0.25-1 mg/kg i.p.), increased the food intake of rats placed in an unfamiliar situation. The effects of clonidine (15 micrograms/kg) were antagonized by yohimbine (0.5-2 mg/kg i.p.). Clonidine (7.5 micrograms/kg) was unable to enhance the efficacy of diazepam (0.5 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) in stimulating food consumption, whereas yohimbine (0.5-2 mg/kg) did not reduce and even increased the potency of diazepam (2 mg/kg) to facilitate food intake. These findings suggest that although noradrenergic processes (and in particular alpha 2-adrenoreceptors) are involved in the hyponeophagia model they do not mediate the releasing effect exerted by benzodiazepines on novelty-induced suppression of food intake.", 
    "27": "Growth hormone secretion from pituitaries of neonatal rats was stimulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABA agonist muscimol in vitro. This response to GABA was absent after the 9th postnatal day. The stimulation of growth hormone secretion by GABA was antagonized by bicuculline-methiodide and by picrotoxin. Diazepam stimulated while baclophen had no effect on growth hormone secretion. This stimulatory GABA effect might be related to a certain developmental stage of the pituitary GABA receptors or to the lack of hypothalamic regulatory influence(s) in the newborn.", 
    "28": "Secondary components of visual evoked potentials (slow negative wave-SNW, and photically-evoked sensory after discharge-SAD) are known to be precursors of experimentally activated wave-spike discharges, similar to wave-spikes of petit mal epilepsy. Both SNW and SAD may be potently suppressed either by amphetamine or GABAergic compounds such as diazepam and sodium valproate. A hypothesis was tested in the present study, that amphetamine-induced suppression of wave-spike discharges may require GABA-benzodiazepine activity for its expression. Electrocortical activity was recorded and averaged in unrestrained albino rats with chronically implanted epicortical electrodes. SNW and SAD obtained in habituated rats in the predrug state were potently suppressed by amphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Fifteen minutes after amphetamine injection, a challenging drug (metrazol, picrotoxin, convulsant benzodiazepine, Ro 5-3663, or imidazodiazepine, Ro 15-1788) was administered intraperitoneally. Subconvulsive doses of metrazol (10 mg/kg) reversed amphetamine suppression; imidazodiazepine (20 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (1.5 mg/kg) reliably opposed the SNW suppression; convulsant benzodiazepine, Ro 5-3663 (2 mg/kg), showed modest and nonsignificant effect in the same direction. It is proposed that the antiepileptic potency of amphetamine may be associated with its ability, apparently via modulatory effect of norepinephrine, to facilitate the activation of benzodiazepine-GABA receptors.", 
    "29": "Neuroleptics such as thioxanthenes (cis(Z)-flupentixol and cis(Z)-clopenthixol) and phenothiazines (fluphenazine and perphenazine), which block both dopamine (DA) D-1 and D-2 receptors and the butyrophenones (haloperidol and spiroperidol), which block D-2 receptors only, are equipotent both behaviorally and clinically. A new compound SCH 23390 which selectively blocks DA D-1 receptors, resembles many neuroleptics in its pharmacological profile: antistereotypic effects in mice, rats and dogs, cataleptogenic effect and inhibitory effect on amphetamine circling. In contrast SCH 23390 has no effect on apomorphine-induced vomiting in dogs and little effects on 6-OHDA-denervated supersensitive DA receptors, stimulated by the DA agonist 3-PPP. In a series of experiments where methylphenidate-induced stereotyped gnawing in mice was inhibited by neuroleptics, it was shown that concomitant treatment with scopolamine or diazepam attenuated the effect of butyrophenones (D-2 antagonists). The same treatment attenuated the effect of phenothiazines, to a lesser extent, and hardly attenuated the effect of thioxanthenes and SCH 23390 at all. It is concluded that DA D-1 receptors are as important as D-2 receptors for the expression of neuroleptic activity in most animal models believed to be predictive of antipsychotic and extrapyramidal side-effect potential. However, the D-1 antagonist is less sensitive than D-2 antagonists to antimuscarinic compounds and benzodiazepines.", 
    "30": "The change in benzodiazepine(BZ)-receptor affinity for selected BZ receptor ligands, induced by pentobarbital at 30 degrees C in the presence of 200 mM NaCl (barbiturate shift) was investigated. The affinity for benzodiazepines (e.g. flunitrazepam) was increased approximately two-fold by the presence of pentobarbital (1 mM) whereas the affinity for convulsive BZ-receptor ligands (e.g. DMCM ) was reduced approximately two-fold. The affinity for BZ-receptor antagonists (e.g. Ro 15-1788) was unaltered by pentobarbital. The results obtained suggest that barbiturate shifts have predictive value in determining the pharmacological efficacies of BZ-receptor ligands. However, compounds such as CL 218.872 and ZK 93423 would not have been recognized as agonists, notwithstanding their clear agonistic profile in pharmacological tests.", 
    "31": "GABA (4-aminobutyric acid) and its bicyclic analog THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[4,5-c]-pyridin-3-ol) produced membrane hyperpolarization and increased chloride ion conductance of mouse spinal cord neurons in cell culture. Above 1 nM diazepam enhanced the actions of both GABA and THIP with similar potency and efficacy. Diazepam has been shown to enhance the binding of [3H]GABA to rat brain membranes over similar concentration ranges, with the EC50 values for enhancement of [3H]GABA binding and increase in membrane conductance being similar. In contrast, binding of [3H]THIP has been shown to be unaltered by diazepam under a variety of conditions. The possible reasons for such a discrepancy between these electrophysiological and neurochemical results with THIP are discussed.", 
    "32": "The specific high affinity binding of [3H]avermectin B1a was investigated in membranes from several rat brain regions. Binding occurred rapidly, was reversible and partially dependent on the presence of chloride ions in the incubation medium. Specific high affinity binding of [3H]avermectin B1a was partially inhibited by GABA receptor agonists and this effect was blocked by GABA receptor antagonists. Pentobarbital and etazolate inhibited, and picrotoxin, picrotoxinin and IPTBO stimulated high affinity binding of [3H]avermectin B1a. All these effects were influenced by the presence of chloride ions in the incubation medium. The results indicate that the high affinity binding site of [3H]avermectin B1a is associated with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ion channel complex.", 
    "33": "Pitrazepin is a potent new GABA antagonist which differs from bicuculline in its chemical structure and its interaction with both [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites, whereby the potency of pitrazepin in displacing [3H]muscimol exceeds that of bicuculline by at least a factor of 10. In physiological experiments, blockade of synaptically released GABA by pitrazepin was shown to reduce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and resulted in the onset of bursting activity which persisted for hours following drug application. The effect of pitrazepin was not tissue specific since it induced a bursting discharge pattern in cultures derived from hippocampus and hypothalamus. Bursting activity was abolished by GABA, baclofen and pentobarbital, but only weakly reduced by midazolam. Pitrazepin also antagonized the action of exogenous GABA, but failed to influence the action of baclofen, an effect which was associated with a decreased membrane input resistance and which was blocked by barium. These results indicate that pitrazepin selectively interacts with the putative GABAA site, thereby antagonizing the chloride-dependent GABA response.", 
    "34": "Saturable, high affinity binding of tritiated pirenzepine [( 3H]-PZ) was obtained in slide mounted tissue sections prior to performing autoradiographic localization of these binding sites. The binding in tissue sections of rostral rat forebrain gave a KD of 18nM and a Bmax of 51 fmoles/mg tissue. These binding characteristics are similar to those previously obtained in homogenate membrane preparations and indicate the binding is taking place in a similar manner. The distribution of the binding sites labeled with [3H]-PZ represented a subpopulation of those which could be labeled with tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]-QNB). Thus, [3H]-PZ and [3H]-QNB both label regions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and dorsal horn of the spinal cord, while sites in the cerebellum, nucleus tractus solitarius, facial nucleus and ventral horn of the spinal cord are labeled with [3H]-QNB and not by [3H]-PZ. These observations indicate separate regions of the brain where antagonists bind to subtypes of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "35": "The anaesthetic effects of a combination of midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, and fentanyl-fluanisone were assessed in laboratory rodents and rabbits. This combination of drugs produced good surgical anaesthesia in all of the species investigated. An important advantage of the combination was that it could be administered as a single intraperitoneal injection.", 
    "36": "The systemic availability of an investigational oral formulation of flurazepam was compared to that of a commercially available product whose therapeutic efficacy has been well established by usage. The experiment was designed to dissociate formula on factors from all other sources of variation including differences between subjects, sexes, sequences of administration, experimental periods, as well as sex by sequence, sex by period, and sex by formulation interactions. Systemic availability was assessed by conventional pharmacokinetic techniques. Pharmacokinetic interpretation and statistical analysis of plasma concentrations of flurazepam and its major blood metabolites namely N-1-hydroxyethylfurazepam and N-1-desalkylflurazepam as a function of time and of systemic availability indicators revealed a nearly identical biopharmaceutical behaviour for the two preparations. A significant difference could be seen in the plasma levels of N-1-desalkylflurazepam between male and female subjects. The results collectively indicate a very similar biopharmaceutical performance of the two oral formulations of flurazepam.", 
    "37": "Three studies were done to determine whether serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity is affected by the symptoms of depression or anxiety. In the population-screening study, serum DBH activity was measured in a heterogeneous sample of 548 medical, surgical, and psychiatric outpatients. No association was found between serum DBH activity and scores on either the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale or the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. In the longitudinal depression study, enzyme activity was measured in 14 patients with major depressive illness treated with imipramine. Serum DBH activity remained unchanged throughout treatment whether or not the patient recovered from the depressive illness. Furthermore, there was no association between enzyme activity and steady state antidepressant plasma levels. In the longitudinal anxiety study, evaluation of 45 anxious outpatients in a placebo-controlled double-blind evaluation of two benzodiazepines (diazepam and alprazolam) indicated that serum DBH activity failed to reflect either state changes in anxiety or pharmacological variables. These results are reviewed with respect to current knowledge regarding neuronal release and extraneuronal disposal of circulating DBH.", 
    "38": "After i.v. administration of 0.2 mg/kg clonazepam to dogs, plasma concentrations followed partly a biexponential and partly a monoexponential decline, the terminal elimination half-life (t0.5 beta or t0.5) being 1.4 +/- 0.3 hr. Over the dose range from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg the elimination rate was dose-dependent. At the highest dose level, one dog showed signs of a saturation kinetics. After oral administration absorption was rapid, but bioavailability poor and highly variable (20-60%). In spite of the high elimination rate in the single dose studies, clonazepam plasma concentrations in the range known as \"therapeutic\" in man could be maintained in subacute studies (1 week) by dosing 0.5 mg/kg b.i.d. or t.i.d. This is most likely explained by a saturation of metabolic inactivation and makes the dog a useful model for man when the drug is given continuously. Protein binding averaged 82% and is thus similar to man. Clonazepam passed the blood/CSF barrier rapidly (P = 0.217 min-1) so that steady state conditions were reached within 10-20 min.", 
    "39": "Midazolam (Ro 21-3981; Dormicum ) is a new water-soluble benzodiazepine. Compared with diazepam and flunitrazepam, it has the advantage of a short half-life and good tolerability after intravenous administration. It induces light sleep 1/2 to 2 min after injection, and anterograde amnesia. It has minimal hemodynamic and respiratory effects. We administered midazolam by intravenous injection in a dose of 3-7 mg to 100 patients about to undergo esophago-, gastro-, or duodenoscopy. The patient became quiet and relaxed, falling into a light sleep but remaining capable of following simple instructions. After completion of the endoscopy, the patients were half awake, and listened attentively to the report. They subsequently usually slept for 1-2 h, afterwards remembering nothing of the procedure. Two (at most, 3) hours after injection, the patients were again completely awake and able to go home or back to work. In some cases, concentration was slightly impaired for the rest of the day. Compared with other premedications , midazolam is better suited for use in endoscopy, owing to its rapid onset and short duration of action.", 
    "40": "The effects of drugs on rate of responding by rats under a multiple fixed-ratio fixed-interval schedule of food presentation were studied before and during chronic administration of l-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM). Small doses of methadone, phencyclidine, chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital increased rates of responding under the fixed-interval component of the schedule. At higher doses, these drugs, as well as LAAM, morphine and haloperidol, decreased rates of responding under both schedule components. Chronic LAAM administration shifted the dose-effect curves for LAAM, morphine, methadone, and to some extent, perhaps pentobarbital, to the right, but did not shift the dose-effect curves to the right for chlordiazepoxide, phencyclidine and haloperidol. The rate-increasing effects of small doses of methadone, phencyclidine, pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide were attenuated during chronic LAAM administration.", 
    "41": "Delayed metabolism of a number of drugs has been described in hypothyroid patients. We report an elderly hypothyroid female who had prolonged delay in the metabolism of a commonly-used sedative, nitrazepam, and discuss the importance of delayed drug metabolism in hypothyroidism.", 
    "42": "Two rapid, sensitive, and specific gas chromatographic (GC) methods for the quantitative determination of quazepam (I), 7-chloro-5-(2-fluorophenyl-1,3-dihydro-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) -2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-thione, and its major active plasma metabolites, the 2-oxo compound (II) and the dealkylated oxo compound (III), have been developed; the first measures I and II and the second measures III. The compounds are extracted from plasma with toluene and quantitated by electron-capture detection using the internal standard method. The methods are capable of quantitating plasma levels of I and II as low as 0.75 ng/mL and plasma levels of III as low as 1.5 ng/mL. Correlation coefficients of standard curves were greater than 0.9995 for all compounds. Precision of the methods was measured at two different concentrations for each compound; the CV values were 3-6% for all three compounds. The recovery of all compounds was greater than 80%, and the ratio of recovery of each compound to that of its internal standard did not vary at different concentrations, indicating appropriate internal standards have been selected for the methods. Quazepam metabolites, other benzodiazepines, and drugs which are potential comedication do not interfere with either method. The methods were shown to be suitable for investigating the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of quazepam at therapeutic doses.", 
    "43": "A prospective multicentre study of all acute poisonings among adults admitted to hospital (n = 1145) or dying outside hospital (n = 67) in Oslo was performed during 1980. Of the 1212 episodes, 98.3% were self-poisonings, giving an annual incidence of 2.8 per 1000 inhabitants (0/00), 3.1 0/00 in males and 2.6 0/00 in females. The main toxic agents among the self-poisoned patients were ethanol (19.7%), benzodiazepines (17.8%), opiates (14.9%), neuroleptics (10.4%) and antidepressants (9.3%). In 58.9% of the episodes more than one toxic agent was taken. Abuse among the self-poisoned patients was significantly (p less than 0.005) more common among males than females (64.2 v. 34.5%). The rate of suicide attempts was significantly (p less than 0.005) higher among females than males (20.2 v. 12.9%), females showing increasing rate with age. However, when excluding abusers the rate of suicide attempts was similar in both sexes (27.6 v. 25.0%). Compared to a reference population self-poisonings were most common in the lower middle and the lowest social classes. Patients in these social classes, however, showed a lower rate of suicide attempts than those in the two highest social classes. Overall mortality was 6.0% (n = 73), but 91.8% of all deaths occurred outside hospital indicating the importance of including these figures when self-poisonings are studied.", 
    "44": "Acute sc toxicity of soman increased in the order, mice----rats----guinea pigs----dogs, being 12.6 times more toxic to dogs (LD50 = 0.05 mumol/kg) than to mice. It was 2.8 times more toxic than tabun to mice and 35 times more toxic to dogs. HI-6 was the least toxic and had similar toxicity values to the four animal species studied and HGG-12 the most toxic of the three oximes used. HGG-12 has shown the greatest interspecies variation (rats:dogs = 1:19.5). HI-6, HGG-12, and PAM-2 Cl (in conjunction with atropine and diazepam) revealed the best protective effect in soman-poisoned dogs, with the respective protective indices of 9, 6.3, and 3.5, followed by guinea pigs. In tabun poisoning the best, but relatively low, protective effect was found only in guinea pigs. The introduction of diazepam increased the protective effects of atropine-oxime combination in soman and tabun poisoning by 10 to 80%. We suggest that the high toxicity of soman and low toxicity of HI-6 may be anticipated in man. The inefficiency of HI-6, HGG-12, and PAM-2 Cl in tabun poisoning points either to the search of new compounds or to the use of the mixture of the oximes found to be effective against the known chemical warfare nerve agents.", 
    "45": "The carcinogenesis potential of ripazepam , a benzodiazepine derivative, was studied in mice and rats for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively. Groups of 50 male and 50 female CD1 mice and CD rats each were given doses of 15 and 150 mg/kg of ripazepam in the diet. Survival rates were adequate for statistical analysis. Significant suppression of body weight gains occurred in rats but not in mice given 150 mg/kg/day. The compound failed to increase tumor rates or alter the average latency of neoplasm in the rat, the number of male animals with tumors was increased at 150 mg/kg and this was related to a significant increase in the number of animals with hepatocellular tumors. Hepatocellular tumors were increased also in female mice but the increase was not statistically significant. All but one of these hepatic neoplasms were hepatocellular adenomas and the one carcinoma had not metastasized. Other tumor types were not increased.", 
    "46": "It has been shown in experiments on dogs with acute coronary insufficiency (coronary artery constriction and electrical pacing of the right atrium) that the tranquilizers diazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (1.0 mg/kg) do not change the epicardial electrogram as compared to control. The drugs increase the ratio of the retrograde coronary circulation in the ligated coronary artery to the circulation in intact areas of the myocardium, that may evidence circulatory redistribution in favour of the affected myocardial area.", 
    "47": "Insomnia and the use of long-acting hypnotic drugs are prevalent in geriatric populations. These drugs have been shown in the laboratory to adversely affect motor performance in the elderly. To examine the clinical significance of these findings, comparisons were made between patients who experienced a fall during their hospital stay and those who did not fall. It was found that patients over 70 years of age who experienced a fall in the hospital were more likely to be receiving flurazepam than the patients who did not fall.", 
    "48": "The clinical significance of intramuscular premedication with 0.01 mg/kg of atropine in a procedure involving oral benzodiazepine premedication (15 mg midazolam the evening before surgery and on the morning of surgery) was investigated in a double-blind study. As far as sedation, apprehension, excitement, dizziness, emesis, and headache were concerned, there were no significant differences between group 1 (atropine) and group 2 (placebo) patients; however, both during and after anesthesia patients in group 1 had less excessive salivary secretion (especially during extubation). As a result of sympathetic overactivity, patients in group 1 had an increased heart rate and an increased incidence of supraventricular tachycardia. In group 1 intravenous infusion proved more difficult, and in addition, the patients complained more of subjective side effects (dry mouth). There was no significant correlation between the radioimmunologically measured serum concentrations and the clinical effects of atropine measured just before the induction of anesthesia. Substantial interindividual differences were found in these serum levels. From the anesthetist's viewpoint, atropine has both beneficial effects (antisecretory) and unwanted effects (cardiovascular effects). For the patient atropine caused only subjective unwanted effects. Midazolam, a new short-acting, sedative benzodiazepine derivatives, can be used without atropine as an oral premedicant.", 
    "49": "The effect of a specific opioid antagonist, naloxone, was studied in two comparable groups of patients who received i.v. the dose of an anaesthetic agent required to produce loss of consciousness in 50% of subjects. The first group received naloxone 0.006 mg kg-1 5 min before induction of anaesthesia; the second group received a similar volume of saline solution. Thiopentone, Althesin, diazepam, ketamine and propanidid were studied. The differences in percentage of unconscious patients between the naloxone-treated group and the control group were statistically significant for diazepam, ketamine and propanidid. Naloxone did not modify the induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone or Althesin.", 
    "50": "Plasma protein binding in seven severely burned (35% to 85% of body) patients 1 to 25 days after burn injury was examined for two drugs: diazepam (DZ), which binds mainly to serum albumin (ALB), and imipramine (IMI), which binds primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). Protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis, and AAG concentrations were measured by radial immunodiffusion. AAG concentrations increased from 36 to 99 mg/dl (day 1) to 221 to 268 mg/dl (days 5 to 20). The IMI free fraction values decreased from 11.2%-19.7% to 5.5%-7.8% and correlated well with AAG concentrations. IMI free fraction values were lower in burned patients (10.8% +/- 0.8%) than in healthy controls (15.3% +/- 0.7%). In contrast, DZ free fraction did not correlate with AAG or ALB concentrations. The DZ free fraction ranged from 1.5% to 8.04%, and changes in a given individual did not relate to time after injury. Free fraction of DZ was higher in the burned population (3.5% +/- 0.37%) than in healthy controls (1.25% +/- 0.05%). Basic drugs that are highly bound to AAG may show progressive, increased binding after burn injury, whereas drugs binding to ALB may decrease after burn injury. Such binding changes can alter the interpretation of total serum or plasma drug concentrations.", 
    "51": "Quazepam, a benzodiazepine hypnotic, was studied in normal subjects to evaluate steady-state kinetics of quazepam and of its major active plasma metabolites, 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam, after 15 mg once daily by mouth for 14 days. The kinetics of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam can be best described by a two-compartment open model with first-order absorption/formation kinetics. Quazepam was rapidly absorbed and its two major plasma metabolites appeared very quickly in systemic circulation. The elimination t 1/2s of quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam, and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam were 41, 43, and 75 hr. Steady-state levels were predictable from the kinetic data and were reached by the seventh dose for quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam and by the thirteenth dose for N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam. These kinetic profiles may explain the clinical hypnotic effect of quazepam--rapid induction of sleep and long duration of clinical action without appreciable rebound insomnia.", 
    "52": "The behavioural effects of n-propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCP) were assessed in the social interaction test of anxiety and in the holeboard test of exploratory behaviour. n-Propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the time spent in social interaction without affecting locomotor activity, indicating an anxiogenic action. This reduction was not significantly reversed by chlordiazepoxide (3 mg/kg). In the holeboard, beta-CCP (4 mg/kg) reduced exploratory head-dipping and rearing; neither of these effects was significantly reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). The actions of beta-CCP in these two tests are similar to those of the structurally-related compound ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate.", 
    "53": "Benzodiazepines have been shown to stimulate appetite and to affect behaviour in experimental situations that are viewed as providing a model of anxiety. However, the \"anti-anxiety\" effect is normally demonstrated in situations that use food to motivate behaviour. In the present research, the effect of diazepam was tested on the suppression of drinking brought about by a tone that had been previously paired with shock. Diazepam produced a marked decrease in the amount of time it took the animal to resume drinking, thus providing support for the anti-anxiety effect. Both acute and chronic modes of administration were effective, but the effect was even more clear-cut with chronic administration.", 
    "54": "The influence of protein binding on the extraction ratio, and availability, of diazepam has been examined in the single-pass isolated perfused rat liver preparation. Binding of diazepam was varied by adjusting the concentration of albumin in the perfusate. In the absence of binding the extraction ratio of diazepam was high, 0.93-0.995. Extraction decreased dramatically as the degree of binding was increased. The data are more consistent with the \"parallel-tube\" model than with the \"well-stirred\" model, two perfusion models that have been used to describe hepatic drug elimination.", 
    "55": "The effects of chronic administration of sodium valproate (200 mg/Kg/d i.p.) and diazepam (5 mg/Kg/d i.m.) alone or in association on the plasma levels of the pituitary hormones (prolactin, FSH and LH) were studied in the m ale rat. Sodium valproate increases prolactin plasma levels. This effect is antagonized by diazepam. Both molecules do not affect FSH levels, whereas they increase LH levels when given alone or in association. This pharmacological data state precisely the hypothalamohypophysiotropic effects of valproate and diazepam during its association.", 
    "56": "The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine have been implicated in the regulation of both cell proliferation and differentiation. We have monitored the relationship of intracellular polyamine levels with proliferation and differentiation of murine Friend erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. The ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, has been used to inhibit MEL proliferation by depleting intracellular putrescine and spermidine. This inhibition of MEL proliferation is abrogated by exogenous putrescine, spermidine, or spermine. The measurement of intracellular polyamine levels following the addition of these exogenous polyamines demonstrates that spermidine is required for MEL proliferation. Further, we have found a highly significant relationship (p less than 0.0001) between intracellular spermidine levels and MEL proliferation. The results also demonstrate that spermidine is required for induction of MEL differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylene bisacetamide, and butyric acid. Moreover, there is a highly significant relationship (p less than 0.0001) between MEL proliferation and differentiation. The present study thus suggests that spermidine is involved in cell proliferation and, thereby, differentiation of MEL cells.", 
    "57": "Lorcainide is a type I antiarrhythmic drug of the local anesthetic type. It can be given either intravenously or orally, and its pharmacokinetic properties allow relatively long (12 hours) dosing intervals with oral administration. A slowly eliminated metabolite, norlorcainide, probably contributes to the effects of orally administered lorcainide in chronically treated patients. In mainly short term studies, lorcainide has been shown to suppress ventricular ectopy in about 80% of patients treated either orally or intravenously. Preliminary evidence suggests that its efficacy in suppressing ectopy in the setting of acute myocardial infarction is comparable with that of lignocaine (lidocaine). It is of variable efficacy in preventing recurrent ventricular tachycardia and has been shown to be effective in some patients who have failed to respond to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Experience is limited in treating supraventricular arrhythmia, but initial results in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have been favourable. Adverse cardiac effects are infrequent. Abnormal sinus node function may be exacerbated by lorcainide treatment, however, and bundle branch block may be precipitated in patients with pre-existing conduction system disease. Exacerbation of pre-existing arrhythmias is uncommon, and clinically important myocardial depression has not been observed. The most frequent side effect is disturbed sleep during the initiation of oral treatment, which may occur in the majority of patients but usually responds to treatment with a benzodiazepine and subsides with time. Thus, lorcainide appears useful against a variety of arrhythmias. With its convenient dosage schedule and apparently low incidence of serious side effects it should become a useful addition to the antiarrhythmic agents available, although longer term studies are needed to confirm its continued efficacy and lack of unexpected side effects when used for long periods.", 
    "58": "Acute toxic interactions of intravenously administered benzyl alcohol and Escherichia coli O55:B5 (Boivin preparation) endotoxin were examined in rodents. Lethality studies in male CD-1 mice demonstrated that these agents were more toxic when administered in combination than when either was administered alone. Prophylactic treatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) protected against lethality induced by either the combination or the endotoxin yet offered little, if any, protection against the lethal effects of benzyl alcohol. Similar treatments with naloxone (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) failed to protect against either endotoxin-induced or benzyl alcohol-induced lethality, but they significantly protected against the lethal effects of the combination. Although hexobarbital-induced sleeping time was prolonged in endotoxin-treated mice (but was normal in benzyl alcohol-treated mice), a more protracted effect on sleeping time was observed in mice treated with both benzyl alcohol and endotoxin. Moreover, male Wistar rats treated with benzyl alcohol (40 mg) showed no evidence of hepatic lesions, but rats treated in combination with sublethal doses of the alcohol (40 mg) and the endotoxin (0.4 mg) developed hepatic lesions which were severe than those observed in rats treated with endotoxin (0.4 mg) alone. A correlation between altered blood chemistry values and severity of hepatic lesions was demonstrated. These data show in vivo toxic interactions between benzyl alcohol and bacterial endotoxin. In addition, our results indicate that the toxic effects induced by the benzyl alcohol-endotoxin combination are due to an enhancement of the lethal properties of bacterial endotoxin.", 
    "59": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were characterized in vivo by studying ex vivo the binding of [3H]muscimol to cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and corpus striatum of mice receiving intravenous injections of tracer doses of high-specific-activity (approximately equal to 30 Ci/mmol) [3H]muscimol. This ligand binds with high affinity (apparent Kd, 2-3 X 10(-9) M) to a single population of binding sites (apparent Bmax, 250-180 fmol per 10 mg of protein). Pharmacological studies using drugs that selectively bind to GABAA or GABAB receptors suggest that [3H]muscimol specifically labels a GABAA recognition site. Moreover, diazepam (1.5 mumol/kg, i.p.) increases the Bmax but fails to change the affinity of [3H]muscimol binding to different brain areas. This diazepam-elicited increase in Bmax is blocked in mice receiving the diazepam antagonist Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a]-[1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate). Since the diazepam-induced increase of [3H]muscimol binding is paralleled by a significant potentiation of the inhibitory effect of muscimol on locomotor activity, it is proposed that the facilitatory action on GABAergic transmission elicited in vivo by diazepam is mediated by an increase in the Bmax of the binding sites of GABAA receptors.", 
    "60": "The density of high affinity binding sites for [3H]4'-chlorodiazepam [( 3H]Ro 5-4864) in guinea pig cerebral cortex is significantly higher (3.8-fold) than the density reported in the rat, and is nearly equal to the density of binding sites for other [3H]benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, flunitrazepam). The density of these [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding sites was generally higher in guinea pig brain than in rat brain, with the exception of olfactory bulb. Both the subcellular distribution and pharmacologic profile of these sites in guinea pig brain appears qualitatively similar to observations previously reported in the rat. The high density of binding sites for [3H]Ro 5-4864, coupled with the potency of this compound as a convulsant in the guinea pig, suggest this species will be a valuable model for elucidating putative pharmacologic and physiologic functions of these sites in brain.", 
    "61": "Ro 15-1788 is thought to interact specifically with the benzodiazepine receptor population in the mammalian CNS as an antagonist. We have compared the kinetics of interaction of this ligand with the benzodiazepine agonist flunitrazepam in the rat cerebellum. The association of [3H]Ro 15-1788 with the benzodiazepine receptor in this brain region is monoexponential, and the dissociation, initiated either by dilution or by displacement with a number of different ligands, also obeys simple monoexponential kinetics. There is no evidence of cooperative interactions with this ligand, and its dissociation is unaffected by the presence of 100 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid and/or 150 mM sodium chloride. In contrast, the dissociation of the agonist [3H]flunitrazepam is biphasic, and the possible interpretation of this data in terms of agonist-induced conformational change is discussed. Evidence is also presented that the mechanism of interaction of Ro 15-1788 with the benzodiazepine receptor population in hippocampal membranes is distinct from that found in the cerebellum.", 
    "62": "Ethanol appears to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic transmission. Using radioligand binding techniques, we investigated the possibility that the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex is the site responsible for this effect. Ethanol at concentrations up to 100 mM failed to alter binding of [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ), [3H]Ro 15-1788, or [3H]methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (MBCC) to benzodiazepine receptors, or of [3H]muscimol to GABA receptors in rat brain membranes. Scatchard analyses of the binding of these radioligands at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C revealed no significant effects of 100 mM ethanol on receptor affinity or number. A variety of drugs as well as chloride ion increased binding of [3H]FNZ and/or [3H]muscimol, but these influences were not modified by ethanol. These findings indicate that ethanol probably potentiates GABAergic neurotransmission at a signal transduction site beyond the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "63": "The sensitivity of neurones in the cingulate cortex of the rat to iontophoretically applied substance P (SP) was tested one hour after a single dose of various antidepressant drugs and also 1 day following the termination of a chronic dosing schedule (14 once daily injections) of the same agents. One hour after a single injection of desipramine (DMI), chlorimipramine (CMI), trimipramine (TMI) or zimelidine ( ZIM ) (all at 10 mg kg-1 i.p.) there was no change in the mean size of excitatory responses to SP compared to those before the injection. There was a tendency towards a decrease in the TMI group. One day following the last of 14 consecutive daily injections (10 mg kg-1 i.p.) of the above agents there was a significant increase in the size of excitatory responses to SP compared to those in rats receiving daily saline injections. However, 14 days of treatment with DMI did not alter the responses to L-glutamate. Similar chronic dosing schedules with either diazepam (5 mg kg-1) or fluphenazine (5 mg kg-1) did not affect the responses to SP. Thus chronic but not acute administration of antidepressant drugs results in an increase in the sensitivity of neurones, in the cingulate cortex of the rat, to SP.", 
    "64": "Findings showed that monkeys with middle, but not anterior or posterior hippocampal damage, are impaired in ability to acquire matching-to-sample, if training is conducted without error correction. All groups except this middle hippocampal lesion group abandoned the spatial strategy and achieved above-chance levels of matching within 6,000 trials. Although monkeys with anterior and posterior hippocampal lesions abandoned spatial strategies of responding at the normal rate, they, along with the middle hippocampal lesion group began to show a short-session-effect which coincided with just-above-chance matching performance. Affected monkeys, although able to correctly match, would not consume the food pellet reward, showed signs of anxiety, and performed only 25 of the usual 200 problems offered each day. None of the surgical control or unoperated control monkeys exhibited the short-session-effect. The untreated short-session-effect continued for as long as two months, but was always quickly alleviated by oxazepam, diazepam, or chlordazepoxide hydrochloride.", 
    "65": "Oral administration of zopiclone to mice (10 mg/kg daily) for 14 days had no significant effect on body weight, liver weight, hepatic microsomal protein or cytochrome P-450 contents but produced significant increases in the activities of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, NADH-ferricyanide reductase, aniline hydroxylation and aminopyrine N-demethylation.", 
    "66": "Six healthy volunteers were given a standard regimen of bromazepam (Lexotan) (6 mg t.d.s.) for five days. Compliance with the study protocol was demonstrated by measuring drug concentrations at steady state. Steady-state levels of 3-hydroxybromazepam were also determined. These were found to be much lower than the concentrations of bromazepam. Since the metabolite is known to be less active than the parent drug, it is likely that the metabolic will contribute little to the pharmacological effects of the drug in humans. Antipyrine pharmacokinetics were studied immediately before bromazepam administration was started, after the dosing schedule had been completed and one week after dosing had been discontinued. There were no significant changes in the disposition of antipyrine on any occasion. Therefore, although previous studies have demonstrated enzyme induction in laboratory animals given high doses of bromazepam, similar effects are unlikely to occur in humans being treated with therapeutic doses of the compound.", 
    "67": "All the drugs studied here present anticholinergic antimuscarinic dose-dependent activity reversible in front of acetylcholine whether exogenous or released by electrically stimulated Guinea-pig ileum. The classification in decreasing order of anticholinergic power is as follows: atropine, pirenzepine, trimipramine, clozapine, clotiapine , thiotixene , trazodone. Atropine, pirenzepine and probably trazodone act as competitive antagonists, while the other ones have an antagonistic non-competitive action. The action mainly occurs at a postsynaptic level and only trazodone would present a high component of presynaptic action. Our results bear out the hypotheses denying any relation between anticholinergic power and extrapyramidal effects in neuroleptics and between anticholinergic action and antidepressive effect in antidepressants.", 
    "68": "Profiles of using the intravenous mononarcosis (sodium hydroxybutyrate, viadryl , ketamin , sombrevin, seduxen) in urgent surgery and traumatology are analyzed. Choice of certain narcotics is motivated for patients with blood loss and shock, intoxication, insufficiency of kidneys, adrenals and liver, cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders. The problem of antinarcotics is considered with reference to the efficiency of specific (bemegride, gutimine , amtizol , cytochrome \"C\") and nonspecific ( osmodiuretics , infusion media containing thawing water) antinarcotics . A preliminary assessment of the efficiency of different drugs of antinarcotic action is given.", 
    "69": "Several new benzodiazepines were studied with respect to their ability to bind specifically to benzodiazepine receptor sites in rat cerebral cortex membrane fraction. The IC50 values of new benzodiazepines were compared to that of diazepam. A group of triazolo-[1,4] benzodiazepines displaced 3H-diazepam very effectively. The most potent of this group was brotizolam . Its potency was about ten times higher than that of diazepam. In this study, camazepam, which differs from diazepam in its C-3 substitution, had the lowest affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor site. This potency was about 0.006 that of diazepam. CM 7116 bound with the highest affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor site among the metabolites of CM 6912. The length of the side chain at the C-3 position of this compound is shorter than that of the other metabolites of CM 6912. These results indicated that the long side chain at the C-3 position might inhibit a close interaction between the receptor site and the substrate molecule, thereby leading to low-affinity binding.", 
    "70": "The effect of equimolar cumulative concentrations of 11 different benzodiazepines on the indirectly evoked twitch contraction was investigated in the rat in-vitro phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation. Depending on the pattern of the concentration-response curves two groups of benzodiazepines can be distinguished: (i) a first group with a biphasic action, e.g. potentiation of twitch tension in low concentrations and depression of twitch tension in high concentrations, and (ii) a second group with primary depression of twitch tension with increasing concentrations. All of the tested compounds ultimately caused a 100% depression of twitch tension at concentrations ranging from 0.175 to 0.35 mmol litre-1. Although this peripheral effect of benzodiazepines on neuromuscular function is not the main site of action of these compounds, there are enough arguments to state that it is not a simple toxic effect. There is some evidence from this study that the peripheral component of the benzodiazepine effect on muscle relaxation may involve a multi- rather than one single receptor system.", 
    "71": "The influence of cimetidine coadministration, 300 mg every 6 hours, on the kinetics of single oral doses of oxazepam (30 mg), lorazepam (2 mg), and flurazepam (30 mg) was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Cimetidine had no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration or the time of peak concentration for either oxazepam, lorazepam, or desalkylflurazepam (formed from flurazepam). Cimetidine likewise did not alter the elimination half-life of oxazepam (9.4 hours) or lorazepam (11.6 hours), and did not change total AUC for lorazepam. Oxazepam AUC was increased an average of 10 per cent by cimetidine (P less than 0.02). In contrast, cimetidine prolonged desalkylflurazepam elimination half-life (141 vs. 94 hours, P less than 0.1) and increased AUC an average of 65 per cent (P less than 0.05). Thus, cimetidine has little or no influence on the absorption or disposition of oxazepam and lorazepam, two benzodiazepines biotransformed by glucuronide conjugation. However, cimetidine slows the elimination of flurazepam's metabolite, desalkylflurazepam, which is biotransformed by oxidation.", 
    "72": "Six benzodiazepine tranquilizers were tested in limited in vivo bioassays for their ability to initiate or promote the development of preneoplastic and neoplastic rat liver lesions. The benzodiazepine produced no liver altered hepatocellular foci during a 14-week period of administration whereas a large number were produced by the liver carcinogen, N-2-fluorenylacetamide. To assay for promoting activity and confirm the lack of initiating activity, N-2-fluorenylacetamide was used to produce altered foci and early neoplastic nodules in rat liver by 8 weeks of dietary administration and the benzodiazepines were then administered for 12 weeks. The liver neoplasm promoter phenobarbital had a substantial enhancing effect upon the persistence of early lesions but none of the benzodiazepines showed a similar effect. Thus in these limited bioassays monitored by histopathology, the benzodiazepine tranquilizers failed to exhibit either an initiating or a promoting action. In these studies, the liver and plasma enzymes, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate-oxalacetic transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatases, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase were monitored to determine if any alterations correlated with liver pathological changes. gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase activity in both liver and plasma was markedly increased during initiation by N-2-fluorenylacetamide. Following cessation of carcinogen exposure, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase remained elevated, providing an indication of past initiation. Administration of phenobarbital after N-2-fluorenylacetamide resulted in an elevation of liver and plasma gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, but none of the benzodiazepines produced this effect and thus no biochemical evidence of a promoting effect on the liver was observed. Correlations between liver and plasma gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and the occurrence of foci were excellent, indicating that determination of plasma activity can be used as an index of the process of hepatocarcinogenesis.", 
    "73": "A test for muscle relaxation in rats is described. The pull-up test is performed by holding an inverted rat by its hind legs. The time taken by the rat to pull itself up and grasp the hand of the experimenter is used as the test parameter. It is simple and quick and separates muscle relaxation from sedation, catalepsy, and catatonia.", 
    "74": "Two patients are described who developed neuroleptic drug-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) secondary to the treatment of schizophrenia. In both patients, neuroleptic drug discontinuation brought about a decrease in the severity of the TD and an increase in schizophrenic symptomatology. Reserpine was added for both antipsychotic coverage and reported beneficial effects in the treatment of TD. The patients' schizophrenia was controlled using reserpine 1 mg/d; the TD dissipated in one patient and decreased in the other. After about seven weeks of reserpine therapy, both patients developed depressive symptoms that required the addition or alprazolam. Within a month of the initiation of alprazolam, the depressions had cleared. Alprazolam may block reserpine-induced increases in beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain and may account for the antidepressive effects in these two patients.", 
    "75": "Intravenous midazolam and diazepam have been compared as sedatives during surgery performed under local anaesthesia. Satisfactory conditions were produced by both drugs. No difference was detected in the rate of recovery, but a highly significant greater degree of amnesia followed the use of midazolam."
