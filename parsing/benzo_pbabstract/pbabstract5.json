    "1": "An expert panel was convened comprising epileptologists with nationally recognized expertise in Dravet syndrome and parents of children with Dravet syndrome, whose experience and understanding was enhanced by their active roles in Dravet syndrome associations. Panelists were asked to base their responses to questions both on their clinical expertise and results of a literature review that was forwarded to each panelist. Three rounds of online questionnaires were conducted to identify areas of consensus and strength of that consensus, as well as areas of contention.", 
    "2": "The panel consisted of 13 physicians and five family members. Strong consensus was reached regarding typical clinical presentation of Dravet syndrome, range of electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging findings, need for genetic testing, critical information that should be conveyed to families at diagnosis, priorities for seizure control and typical degree of control, seizure triggers and recommendations for avoidance, first- and second-line therapies for seizures, requirement and indications for rescue therapy, specific recommendations for comorbidity screening, and need for family support. Consensus was not as strong regarding later therapies, including vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy, and for specific therapies of associated comorbidities. Beyond the initial treatment with benzodiazepines and use of valproate, there was no consensus on the optimal in-hospital management of convulsive status epilepticus.", 
    "3": "We were able to identify areas where there was strong consensus that we hope will (1) inform health care providers on optimal diagnosis and management of patients with Dravet syndrome, (2) support reimbursement from insurance companies for genetic testing and Dravet syndrome-specific therapies, and (3) improve quality of life for patients with Dravet syndrome and their families by avoidance of unnecessary testing and provision of an early accurate diagnosis allowing optimal selection of therapeutic strategies.",

    "5": "Databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus were systematically searched using the terms: \"drug-facilitated sexual assault\", \"chemical submission\", \"date rape\", \"rape drugs\" and \"drink-spiking\" to identify relevant studies for inclusion in the review. This study focused on adult victims of suspected DFSA aged 16 years and above in which toxicology results were reported.", 
    "6": "The majority of studies included were published in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, with only a single study dedicated to this area in both Australia and Europe. Epidemiology, prevalence rates, and toxicology for DFSA appear broadly commensurate across different continents, although there are some differences in how \"drug-facilitated sexual assault\" is defined, as well as differences in the sensitivity of toxicological analyses. Nonetheless, alcohol is the most commonly detected substance and co-occurrence with other drugs is common. Aside from alcohol there was no other specific drug category associated with DFSA. Cannabinoids and benzodiazepines were frequently detected, but a lack of contextual information made it difficult to establish the extent that these substances contributed to suspected cases of DFSA.", 
    "7": "This comprehensive review suggests that alcohol intoxication combined with voluntary drug consumption presents the greatest risk factor for DFSA, despite populist perceptions that covert drink-spiking is a common occurrence. There is a need to develop policies that encourage early responders to suspected DFSA (e.g., law enforcement agencies, medical staff, support agencies, etc), to collect detailed information about the individual's licit and illicit drug consumption history, in order to assist in providing appropriate and more thorough contextual information.", 
    "8": "This naturalistic European multicenter study aimed to elucidate the association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and comorbid anxiety disorders. Demographic and clinical information of 1346 MDD patients were compared between those with and without concurrent anxiety disorders. The association between explanatory variables and the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders was examined using binary logistic regression analyses. 286 (21.2%) of the participants exhibited comorbid anxiety disorders, 10.8% generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 8.3% panic disorder, 8.1% agoraphobia, and 3.3% social phobia. MDD patients with comorbid anxiety disorders were characterized by younger age (social phobia), outpatient status (agoraphobia), suicide risk (any anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia), higher depressive symptom severity (GAD), polypsychopharmacy (panic disorder, agoraphobia), and a higher proportion receiving augmentation treatment with benzodiazepines (any anxiety disorder, GAD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia) and pregabalin (any anxiety disorder, GAD, panic disorder). The results in terms of treatment response were conflicting (better response for panic disorder and poorer for GAD). The logistic regression analyses revealed younger age (any anxiety disorder, social phobia), outpatient status (agoraphobia), suicide risk (agoraphobia), severe depressive symptoms (any anxiety disorder, GAD, social phobia), poorer treatment response (GAD), and increased administration of benzodiazepines (any anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia) and pregabalin (any anxiety disorder, GAD, panic disorder) to be associated with comorbid anxiety disorders. Our findings suggest that the various anxiety disorders subtypes display divergent clinical characteristics and are associated with different variables. Especially comorbid GAD appears to be characterized by high symptom severity and poor treatment response.",

Areas covered: The evidence for the role of benzodiazepines, anxiolytics, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, cannabinoids, nebulized furosemide and herbal-based treatments were critically reviewed. Search of the Clinical Trials Registry (Clinicaltrial.gov) identified ongoing studies expected to generate new data in the near future in several classes of non-opioid medications for their net effect on chronic breathlessness. Expert commentary: Morphine still has the best level of evidence for the symptomatic treatment of chronic breathlessness. Non-opioid treatments for chronic breathlessness are less studied than morphine and morphine-related medications although evidence is emerging in relation to some options. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend non-opioids in the routine treatment of chronic breathlessness. There is a need to find agents, new as well as re-purposed, that can be used as alternative therapies to opioids for chronic breathlessness for people who are unable to tolerate morphine.",

    "15": "Status epilepticus (SE) is an important neurological emergency. It is defined as seizures lasting for 5 minutes or more or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness to baseline between the attacks. Refractory SE (RSE) is defined as SE persisting despite sufficient dose of benzodiazepines and at least one antiepileptic drug (AED), irrespective of time. Super refractory SE (SRSE) is defined as SE that continues for 24 hours or more after the use of anesthetic therapy, including cases that recur on weaning of the anesthestic agent. RSE occurs in 23%-48% of the patients and SRSE in approximately 22% of the patients with SE. In general, RSE occurs in patients with new-onset seizures rather than in patients with chronic epilepsy. The etiology of RSE in developing countries is dominated by central nervous system (CNS) infections and head injury compared to stroke and drug withdrawal in the developed countries. The treatment of RSE and SRSE is not evidence based. Following benzodiazepines, the second line antiepileptic drugs include sodium valproate, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and anesthetic drugs such as midazolam, phenobarbital, and propofol. Most intravenous anesthetic drugs produce hypotension and respiratory suppression; therefore, patients with RSE are managed in intensive care units (ICUs). In RSE patients, electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression with interburst interval of 2-20 s or even flat EEG has been tried. Recently, concerns have been raised on the safety of burst suppression in RSE and SRSE. The paucity of ICUs in developing countries limits the use of these management protocols. There is a need to explore intravenous AEDs with safer cardiovascular and respiratory profile for the management of SE.", 
    "16": "Background After surgical procedures, patients are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism, clinically manifested as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Objective To evaluate the influence of polypharmacotherapy, comorbidity, drug treatments, packed red blood cells application, adequacy of thromboprophylaxis, and patient characteristics on the occurrence of DVT or PE in postsurgical patients. Setting The surgical department at Murska Sobota\u00a0General Hospital, Slovenia. Methods In this retrospective case control study, the records of 286 surgical patients were analysed: DVT or PE group (n\u00a0=\u00a0144) and control group (n\u00a0=\u00a0142). The number of prescribed drugs and drug-drug interactions were reviewed, together with prescription of low-molecular-weight heparins. The odds ratios (OR) of risk factors for DVT or PE were calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Main outcome measure Risk factors assessment for the occurrence of DVT or PE in surgical patients. Results Polypharmacotherapy (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.03-3.96, p\u00a0=\u00a00.040) and packed red blood cells application (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.46-8.10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) were associated with an increased risk of PE or DVT after surgery. Inadequate thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins significantly increased the likelihood of DVT or PE (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.41-4.43, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There were no differences between the groups concerning the treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines or antipsychotics. Conclusions Patients with polypharmacotherapy and patients receiving red blood cells should be monitored more closely after surgery as they are more likely to develop DVT or PE.", 
    "17": "It was shown that the anxiolytic effect of Selank is comparable to that of classical benzodiazepine drugs and that the basis of their mechanism of action may be similar. These data suggest that the presence of Selank may change the action of classical benzodiazepine drugs. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the anxiolytic activity of Selank and diazepam in rats both under conditions of unpredictable chronic mild stress and in its absence, after the individual and combined administration of these compounds using the elevated plus maze test. We found that, even in the absence of chronic stress, the administration of a course of test substances changed anxiety indicators toward their deterioration, but the changes after the administration of a course of Selank were less pronounced. In conditions of chronic stress, anxiety indicator values after the simultaneous use of diazepam and Selank did not differ from the respective values observed before chronic stress exposure. The data obtained indicate that the individual administration of Selank was the most effective in reducing elevated levels of anxiety, induced by the administration of a course of test substances, whereas the combination of diazepam with Selank was the most effective in reducing anxiety in unpredictable chronic mild stress conditions.",

    "30": "Pharmaceuticals as environmental contaminants have received a lot of interest over the past decade but, for several pharmaceuticals, relatively little is known about their occurrence in European surface waters. Benzodiazepines, a class of pharmaceuticals with anxiolytic properties, have received interest due to their behavioral modifying effect on exposed biota. In this study, our results show the presence of one or more benzodiazepine(s) in 86% of the analyzed surface water samples (n\u00a0=\u00a0138) from 30 rivers, representing seven larger European catchments. Of the 13 benzodiazepines included in the study, we detected 9, which together showed median and mean concentrations (of the results above limit of quantification) of 5.4 and 9.6\u00a0ng\u00a0L(-1), respectively. Four benzodiazepines (oxazepam, temazepam, clobazam, and bromazepam) were the most commonly detected. In particular, oxazepam had the highest frequency of detection (85%) and a maximum concentration of 61\u00a0ng\u00a0L(-1). Temazepam and clobazam were found in 26% (maximum concentration of 39\u00a0ng\u00a0L(-1)) and 14% (maximum concentration of 11\u00a0ng\u00a0L(-1)) of the samples analyzed, respectively. Finally, bromazepam was found only in Germany and in 16 out of total 138 samples (12%), with a maximum concentration of 320\u00a0ng\u00a0L(-1). This study clearly shows that benzodiazepines are common micro-contaminants of the largest European river systems at ng L(-1) levels. Although these concentrations are more than a magnitude lower than those reported to have effective effects on exposed biota, environmental effects cannot be excluded considering the possibility of additive and sub-lethal effects.",

Benzodiazepine-type drugs bind to GABAA receptors containing \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, and \u03b15 subunits (\u03b11GABAA, \u03b12GABAA, \u03b13GABAA and \u03b15GABAA receptors, respectively) through which they inhibit the transmission of these signals. In the present study we describe the novel benzodiazepine site positive allosteric modulator modulator methyl 8-ethynyl-6-(pyridin-2-yl)-4H-benzo[f]imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]diazepine-3-carboxylate (MP-III-024).

Administration of MP-III-024 resulted in a dose- and time-dependent reversal of mechanical hyperalgesia. On locomotor activity and schedule-controlled responding, MP-III-024 was ineffective across the doses tested. These data provide further evidence that \u03b12GABAA and \u03b13GABAA receptors play an important role in the antihyperalgesic effects and may not be involved in some of the undesired effects of benzodiazepine-like drugs.

These concerns have been most pronounced in the United States, but limited data make it difficult to determine whether it is a problem in other countries. We investigated opioid analgesic misuse and abuse in participants from the Global Drug Survey 2015 resident in the United States (N = 1334), United Kingdom (N = 1199), France (N = 1258), Germany (N = 866), and Australia (N = 1013) who had used at least 1 prescription opioid analgesic medication in the past year. We also investigated the relationship with polysubstance use, one of the most consistent predictors of problematic opioid analgesic use. Data included misuse and abuse of codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and tramadol; ability to obtain a prescription; different sources for obtaining drugs; and past-year use of benzodiazepines and illicit drugs. In multilevel models, country of residence accounted for less than 3% of the variance in opioid analgesic misuse or abuse. Adjusting for country of residence and sociodemographic factors, use of illicit drugs and benzodiazepines was associated with 4-fold greater odds of misuse (odds ratio 4.36, 95% confidence interval 3.29-5.93) and 6-fold greater odds of abuse compared with not using either drug (odds ratio 6.49, 95% confidence interval 4.0-10.48), although the strength of the association with abuse varied by country.

The non-specific depression of the central nervous system is probably the most significant factor for the changes in hemodynamics in APE. Retrospective studies have shown both negative and neutral effects in patients with APE and therefore some authors have suggested benzodiazepines as an alternative treatment. The use of intravenous morphine in the treatment of APE remains controversial.",

The mean patient age was 33\u00a0years (range 16-74), 68% were male. Alcohol co-ingestion was reported in 54% of the cases, and use of more than one recreational drug in 37% of the cases. Most presentations were related to cocaine (29%), cannabis (26%), heroin (20%) and benzodiazepines/sedatives (18%). Urine drug screening immunoassay was available in 277 cases (55%). The most frequently detected substances were cannabis (29%), cocaine (22%), benzodiazepines (21%) and opioids excluding methadone (20%). There were only two intoxications with novel psychoactive substances (NPSs): One with methylone and one with 2,5-dimethoxy-4(n)-propylphenethylamine (2C-P). The majority of patients (58%) displayed impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15) upon presentation and/or pre-hospital; 21% were unconscious (GCS <8).

    "62": "Despite continued interest in the 18kDa translocator protein (PBR/TSPO) as a biomarker and a therapeutic target for a range of diseases, its functional role, such as in the steroid synthesis pathway and energy metabolism has either become contentious or remains to be described more precisely. The PBR/TSPO gene consists of four exons, while a shorter isoform termed PBR-S lacks exon 2. The PBR-S 102-codon open reading frame differs to that of PBR/TSPO, resulting in a protein that is completely unrelated to PBR/TSPO. To our knowledge, PBR-S protein has never been described and has no known or proposed function. To obtain possible clues on the role of this uncharacterised protein, we compared the subcellular distribution of PBR-S to that of PBR/TSPO. By expressing fluorescently tagged PBR/TSPO, we confirmed that full-length PBR/TSPO co-localises with mitochondria in HeLa, HEK-293, MDA-MB-231, BJ and U87-MG human cell lines. Unlike the strictly mitochondrial localisation of PBR/TSPO, PBR-S has a punctate distribution throughout the cytosol that co-localises with lysosomes in HeLa, HEK-293, MDA-MB-231, BJ and U87-MG cells. In summary, within the cell lines examined we confirm mitochondria rather than occasionally reported other localisations, such as the cell nucleus, to be the only site where PBR/TSPO resides. Due to the lack of any shared protein sequences and the different subcellular locations, we suggest that the previously uncharacterised PBR-S protein variant of the PBR/TSPO gene is likely to serve a different yet to be discovered function compared to PBR/TSPO.",

In addition to immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) formulations, the new delivery forms including two sublingual tablets [standard dose (SD) and low dose (LD)], and an oral spray form have been recently developed which bypass the gastrointestinal tract. So far, Zolpidem has been studied in several clinical populations: cases poor sleepers, transient insomnia, elderly and non-elderly patients with chronic primary insomnia, and in comorbid insomnia. Peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of zolpidem-IR occurs in 45 to 60min, with the terminal elimination half-life (t\u00bd) equating to 2.4h. The extended-release formulation results in a higher concentration over a period of more than 6h. Peak plasma concentration is somewhat shorter for the sublingual forms and the oral spray, while their t\u00bd is comparable to that of zolpidem-IR. Zolpidem-IR reduces sleep latency (SL) at recommended doses of 5mg and 10mg in elderly and non-elderly patients, respectively. Zolpidem-ER at doses of 6.25mg and 12.5mg, improves sleep maintenance in elderly and non-elderly patients, respectively, 4h after its administration. Sublingual zolpidem-LD (5mg) and zolpidem oral spray are indicated for middle-of-the-night (MOTN) wakefulness and difficulty returning to sleep, while sublingual zolpidem-SD (10mg) is marketed for difficulty falling asleep.

    "68": "The chemical identification of new psychoactive substances (NPS) in the field is challenging due not only to the plethora of substances available, but also as a result of the chemical complexity of products and the chemical similarity of NPS analogues. In this study, handheld Raman spectroscopy and the use of two excitation wavelengths, 785 and 1064nm, were evaluated for the identification of 60 NPS products. The products contained a range of NPS from classes including the aminoindanes, arylalkylamines, benzodiazepines, and piperidines & pyrrolidines. Identification was initially assessed using the instruments' in built algorithm (i.e., % HQI) and then further by visual inspection of the Raman spectra. Confirmatory analysis was preformed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. For the 60 diverse products, an NPS was successfully identified via the algorithm in 11 products (18%) using the 785nm source and 29 products (48%) using the 1064nm source. Evaluation of the Raman spectra showed that increasing the excitation wavelength from 785 to 1064nm improved this 'first pass' identification primarily due to a significant reduction in fluorescence, which increased S/N of the characteristic peaks of the substance identified. True positive correlations between internet products and NPS signatures ranged from 57.0 to 91.3% HQI with typical RSDs<10%. Tablet formulations and branded products were particularly challenging as a result of low NPS concentration and high chemical complexity, respectively. This study demonstrates the advantage of using a 1064nm source with handheld Raman spectroscopy for improved 'first pass' NPS identification when minimal spectral processing is required, such as when working in field. Future investigations will focus on the use of mixture algorithms, effect of NPS concentration, and further improvement of spectral libraries.", 
    "69": "Overexposure to benzidine has been manifested as an important cause of bladder cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of benzidine-induced malignancy is still insufficiently interpreted. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial pathophysiological process in embryonic development as well as initiation and development of epithelium-originated malignant tumors. The role of extracellular regulated protein kinase 5 (ERK5) in benzidine-meditated bladder cancer development has not been explored. In the present study, we explored the role of ERK5/AP-1 pathway in benzidine-induced EMT in human normal urothelial cells and the intervention effect of curcumin on bezidine-induced EMT. We found that benzidine-induced EMT in SV-40 immortalized human urothelial cells (SV-HUC-1) at low concentrations. We detected that ERK5/AP-1 pathway was notably activated. Specific ERK5 inhibitor, XMD8-92 was applied to determine the role of ERK5 in benzidine-induced EMT. Results indicated that XMD8-92 reversed the EMT process. Furthermore, curcumin effectively attenuated benzidine-induced urocystic EMT by suppressing ERK5/AP-1 pathway. In conclusion, the present study revealed the positive role of ERK5/AP-1 in benzidine-provoked urocystic EMT and the curcumin promising use in bladder cancer prevention and intervention via ERK5/AP-1 pathway.", 
    "70": "Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related medications (BBRMs) are anxiolytics and hypnotics acting on \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA)A receptors. BBRMs are assumed to have a low potential for major congenital malformations, but research on more subtle and protracted developing symptoms of these medications is lacking. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the association between BBRM use in pregnancy and long-term effects on child behavior in a large population-based cohort study. The study population consisted of 104 children prenatally exposed to BBRM, 527 children exposed to maternal prenatal anxiety or phobic anxiety symptoms (without exposure to BBRM), and 5609 control children. At child age, 6years, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Aggressive Behavior and Anxiety Problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) reported by the mother and the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Children prenatally exposed to BBRM had higher scores of ODD and aggressive behavior, but not of anxiety. However, these associations were explained by maternal anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. Moreover, prenatal exposure to anxiety (without exposure to BBRM) was associated with increased scores of child ODD, aggressive behavior, and anxiety. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that prenatal BBRM exposure was not independently associated with ODD and aggressive behavior in childhood when prenatal anxiety symptoms were taken into account.", 
    "71": "Anxiety disorders are among the most frequent psychiatric disorders. Current treatment guidelines recommend antidepressants, the calcium modulator gabapentin, and benzodiazepines as pharmacological treatments. However, delayed onset of action precludes the use of antidepressants as an acute treatment, while benzodiazepines can be recommended only as an emergency treatment due to their inherent risk of dependence. Therefore, an alternative pharmacological agent with acute efficacy is needed. Preliminary evidence points towards possible anxiolytic properties of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine. The goals of this study were to test the acute anxiolytic properties of quetiapine in patients suffering from arachnophobia in a challenge paradigm, and to assess the effects of quetiapine on the central nervous fear network.",

However, no effect of quetiapine on fear network activity was detected. Further, on questionnaire measures, quetiapine significantly reduced somatic anxiety symptoms, but had no effect on general psychological anxiety.", 
    "74": "Viewing phobic pictures resulted in a robust amygdala activation in arachnophobic patients. Quetiapine seems to have no influence on activation in anxiety-related brain areas but appears to reduce acute somatic anxiety symptoms in patients with specific phobia.

Three external datasets (with congeneric structures to those experimentally resolved in complexes by X-ray and previously reported as SmKDAC8 inhibitors) were employed to compose and validate the most predictive model. Two series characterized by 104 benzodiazepine derivatives (BZDs) and 60 simplified largazole analogs (SLAs), recently reported by our group as human KDAC inhibitors, were tested for their inhibition potency against SmKDAC8 to probe the predictive capability of the quantitative models against compounds with diverse structures. The SmKDAC8 biochemical results confirmed: (1) the benzodiazepine moiety as a valuable scaffold to further investigate when pursuing SmKDAC8 inhibition; (2) the predictive capability of the COMBINEr 2.0 model towards non-congeneric series of compounds, highlighting the most influencing ligand-protein interactions and refining the structure-activity relationships. From the VS investigations, the first 40 top-ranked compounds were obtained and biologically tested for their inhibition potency against SmKDAC8 and hKDACs 1, 3, 6 and 8. Among them, a non-hydroxamic acid benzothiadiazine dioxide derivative (code NSC163639), showed interesting activity and selectivity against SmKDAC8. To further elucidate the structure-activity relationships of NSC163639, two analogs (herein reported as compounds 3 and 4) were synthesized and biologically evaluated. Results suggest the benzothiadiazine dioxide moiety as a promising scaffold to be used in a next step to derive selective SmKDAC8 inhibitors.",

Flavonoids have selective affinity for GABAA receptors implicated in anxiolytic-like activity in rodents, but are devoid of the unwanted side effects of benzodiazepines. In this study, 6-methoxyflavanone (6-MeOF), a positive allosteric modulator of \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) responses at human recombinant GABAA receptors, was evaluated for its behavioral profile in the elevated plus-maze as well as the staircase- plus and open-field tests in mice. In addition, the distribution of 6-MeOF in selected brain areas involved in anxiety (amygdala and cerebral cortex) was also examined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection (HPLC/UV) method. 6-MeOF (10, 30 and 50mg/kg) exerted an anxiolytic-like effect, increasing entries and time spent in the open arm and the central platform, as well as head-dipping frequency in the mouse elevated plus-maze assay. It also decreased rearing incidence without suppressing the number of steps ascended in the staircase test. Whereas, in the open-field anxiety test, 6-MeOF had no effect on locomotor activity at lower doses, a decrease was observed at the highest dose (100mg/kg). 6-MeOF additionally produced an anxiolytic-like increase in the time spent at the center of the open-field apparatus. These effects were preferentially antagonized by pentylenetetrazole (15mg/kg). Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies disclosed a rapid appearance of 6-MeOF in the plasma and discrete brain areas. Taken together, our findings suggest that 6-MeOF readily crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) generating anxiolytic activity, mediated through the GABAergic system.",

In this study, the anticonvulsant activity of DAG was examined using the pentylentetrazole (PTZ) model in mice. Thirty male albino mice were divided randomly and equally to 5 groups, and pretreated with normal saline, diazepam, or various doses of DAG (500, 700, and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.), prior to the injection of PTZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.). The latency and duration of seizures were recorded 30 min after PTZ injection. Pretreatments with naloxone and flumazenil in different groups were studied to further clarify the mechanisms of the anticonvulsant action. Phytochemical screening and thin layer chromatography (TLC) fingerprinting of ammoniacum gum was also determined. DAG showed significant anticonvulsant activity at all doses used. The gum delayed both the onset and the duration of seizures induced by PTZ. Treatment with flumazenil before DAG (700 mg/kg) inhibited the effect of gum on seizure duration and latency to some extent and administration of naloxone before DAG also significantly inhibited changes in latency and duration of seizure produced by DAG. The percentage inhibition was greater with naloxone than with flumazenil. This study showed that DAG had significant anticonvulsant activity in PTZ-induced seizures, and GABAergic and opioid systems may be involved. More studies are needed to further investigate its detailed mechanism.",

However, to what degree miRNAs affect pharmacokinetics (PK) at the systemic level remains unknown. In addition, miR-34a replacement therapy represents a new cancer treatment strategy, although it is unknown whether miR-34a therapeutic agents could elicit any drug-drug interactions. To address this question, we refined a practical single-mouse PK approach and investigated the effects of a bioengineered miR-34a agent on the PK of several cytochrome P450 probe drugs (midazolam, dextromethorphan, phenacetin, diclofenac, and chlorzoxazone) administered as a cocktail. This approach involves manual serial blood microsampling from a single mouse and requires a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay, which was able to illustrate the sharp changes in midazolam PK by ketoconazole and pregnenolone 16\u03b1-carbonitrile as well as phenacetin PK by \u03b1-naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene. Surprisingly, 3-methylcholanthrene also decreased systemic exposure to midazolam, whereas both pregnenolone 16\u03b1-carbonitrile and 3-methylcholanthrene largely reduced the exposure to dextromethorphan, diclofenac, and chlorzoxazone. Finally, the biologic miR-34a agent had no significant effects on the PK of cocktail drugs but caused a marginal (45%-48%) increase in systemic exposure to midazolam, phenacetin, and dextromethorphan in mice. In vitro validation of these data suggested that miR-34a slightly attenuated intrinsic clearance of dextromethorphan. These findings from single-mouse PK and corresponding mouse liver microsome models suggest that miR-34a might have minor or no effects on the PK of coadministered cytochrome P450-metabolized drugs.", 
    "103": "Dysphagia is caused not only by neurological and/or structural damage but also by medication. We hypothesized memantine, dextromethorphan, diazepam, and baclofen, all commonly used drugs with central sites of action, may regulate swallowing function. Swallows were evoked by upper airway (UA)/pharyngeal distension, punctate mechanical stimulation using a von Frey filament, capsaicin or distilled water (DW) applied topically to the vocal folds, and electrical stimulation of a superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) in anesthetized rats and were documented by recording electromyographic activation of the suprahyoid and thyrohyoid muscles and by visualizing laryngeal elevation. The effects of intraperitoneal or topical administration of each drug on swallowing function were studied. Systemic administration of diazepam and baclofen, but not memantine or dextromethorphan, inhibited swallowing evoked by mechanical, chemical, and electrical stimulation. Both benzodiazepines and GABAA receptor antagonists diminished the inhibitory effects of diazepam, whereas a GABAB receptor antagonist diminished the effects of baclofen. Topically applied diazepam or baclofen had no effect on swallowing. These data indicate that diazepam and baclofen act centrally to inhibit swallowing in anesthetized rats.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Systemic administration of diazepam and baclofen, but not memantine or dextromethorphan, inhibited swallowing evoked by mechanical, chemical, and electrical stimulation.

    "107": "Of 17 276 admissions, 626 patients (3.6%) were at least 65 years old. There was a steady decline in the number of overdoses with age. Most self-poisoning by older people was intentional (80% of admissions), but the proportion of unintentional poisonings increased with age (P <\u00a00.001). Median LOS for older patients was 34 h (interquartile range [IQR], 16-75 h), longer than for younger patients (16 h; IQR, 9-25 h; P <\u00a00.001). 133 older patients (21.2%) were admitted to an ICU, compared with 1976 younger patients (11.9%; P <\u00a00.001). 24 older patients (3.8%) and 93 younger patients (0.6%) died; mortality among older patients declined over time. Hypotension and arrhythmias were more common in patients over 65. Benzodiazepines (24%) were the drugs most commonly ingested by older patients, but opioids the most frequently taken drugs in fatal cases. Toxic ingestion of cardiovascular drugs increased threefold over the 26 years; about one-third of poisonings were unintentional or iatrogenic. Recreational drugs were implicated in the admissions of four older patients (0.6%), but in 7.8% of those of people under 65.",

The mechanism of action of CBD in producing such effects remains unclear. Despite evidence that some endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids interact with GABAA receptors, no-one has yet investigated the effects of CBD. Here we used two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology to compare the actions of CBD with those of the major central endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) on human recombinant GABAA receptors (synaptic \u03b11-6\u03b2\u03b32 and extrasynaptic \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4) expressed on Xenopus oocytes. CBD and 2-AG were positive allosteric modulators at \u03b11-6\u03b2\u03b32 receptors, with low micromolar potencies. The maximal level of enhancement seen with either CBD or 2-AG were on \u03b12-containing GABAA receptor subtypes, with approximately a 4-fold enhancement of the GABA EC5 evoked current, more than twice the potentiation seen with other \u03b1-subunit receptor combinations. Further we observed \u03b2-subunit selectivity, whereby modulatory activity was higher at \u03b22/\u03b23 over \u03b21 subunits. The \u03b21-subunit homologous mutant \u03b22(V436T) substantially diminished the efficacy of both drugs to a third of that obtained with wild-type \u03b22 subunit combinations, but without changing potency. The potency of CBD increased and efficacy preserved in binary \u03b11/\u03b12\u03b22 receptors indicating that their effects do not involve the classic benzodiazepine site. Exploration of extrasynaptic \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 receptors revealed that both compounds enhanced GABA EC5 evoked currents at concentrations ranging from 0.01-1\u03bcM. Taken together these results reveal a mode of action of CBD on specifically configured GABAA receptors that may be relevant to the anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects of the compound.",

Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged \u226518 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45\u00b0 to one side and neck extended 20\u00b0 with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.",

Key components included disseminating a dashboard tool that aggregates electronic medical record data to audit real-time opioid-related prescribing and identifying a clinical leader at each facility to implement the tool and promote safer prescribing. This study examines changes associated with OSI implementation in October 2013 among all adult VHA patients who filled outpatient opioid prescriptions. Interrupted time series analyses controlled for baseline trends and examined data from October 2012 to September 2014 to determine the changes after OSI implementation in prescribing of high-dosage opioid regimens (total daily dosages >100 morphine equivalents [MEQ] and >200 MEQ) and concurrent benzodiazepines. Across VHA facilities nationwide, there was a decreasing trend in high-dosage opioid prescribing with 55,722 patients receiving daily opioid dosages >100 MEQ in October 2012, which decreased to 46,780 in September 2014 (16% reduction). The OSI was associated with an additional decrease, compared to pre-OSI trends, of 331 patients per month (95% confidence interval [CI] -378 to -284) receiving opioids >100 MEQ, a decrease of 164 patients per month (95% CI -186 to -142) receiving opioids >200 MEQ, and a decrease of 781 patients per month (95% CI -969 to -593) receiving concurrent benzodiazepines.

The dried blood spot (DBS) sampling technique offers many advantages over using urine or whole blood sampling techniques. This study developed a simple and efficient ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-ion booster-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-IB-QTOF-MS) method for the analysis of abused drugs and their metabolites using DBS. Fifty-seven compounds covering the most commonly abused drugs, including amphetamines, opioids, cocaine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many other new and emerging abused drugs, were selected as the target analytes of this study. An 80% acetonitrile solvent with a 5-min extraction by Geno grinder was used for sample extraction. A Poroshell column was used to provide efficient separation, and under optimal conditions, the analytical times were 15 and 5min in positive and negative ionization modes, respectively. Ionization parameters of both electrospray ionization source and ion booster (IB) source containing an extra heated zone were optimized to achieve the best ionization efficiency of the investigated abused drugs. In spite of their structural diversity, most of the abused drugs showed an enhanced mass response with the high temperature ionization from an extra heated zone of IB source. Compared to electrospray ionization, the ion booster (IB) greatly improved the detection sensitivity for 86% of the analytes by 1.5-14-fold and allowed the developed method to detect trace amounts of compounds on the DBS cards. The validation results showed that the coefficients of variation of intra-day and inter-day precision in terms of the signal intensity were lower than 19.65%. The extraction recovery of all analytes was between 67.21 and 115.14%. The limits of detection of all analytes were between 0.2 and 35.7ngmL(-1). The stability study indicated that 7% of compounds showed poor stability (below 50%) on the DBS cards after 6 months of storage at room temperature and -80\u00b0C.

While neurosteroids act on all GABA-A receptor isoforms, they cause greater effects on extrasynaptic \u03b4GABA-A receptors that mediate tonic inhibition in the brain. Previously, we identified a potential GABA-A receptor mechanism for catamenial epilepsy. However, the precise functional role of extrasynaptic \u03b4GABA-A receptors in the pathophysiology of catamenial epilepsy remains unclear. In this study, we utilized mice lacking extrasynaptic \u03b4GABA-A receptors (\u03b4KO) to investigate whether reduction of tonic inhibition affects catamenial seizure susceptibility or intensity. Intact female wildtype (WT) and \u03b4KO mice were subjected to hippocampus kindling until they exhibited stage 5 seizures. Elevated gonadal hormone-based neurosteroid levels were induced by standard gonadotropin regimen and neurosteroid withdrawal (NSW) was triggered by finasteride. NSW increased susceptibility to, as well the intensity of evoked catamenial-like seizures in WT and \u03b4KO mice. However, fully kindled \u03b4KO mice exhibited an accelerated and augmented response to NSW, with a more rapid increase in seizure susceptibility and intensity than WT mice undergoing the NSW paradigm. Moreover, \u03b4KO mice in NSW showed reduced benzodiazepine sensitivity, but in stark contrast to the increased neurosteroid sensitivity observed in WT animals, \u03b4KO mice displayed no change in neurosteroid sensitivity in response to NSW. The increased catamenial seizure exacerbation and alterations in antiseizure drug responses are consistent with NSW-induced changes in the abundance of \u03b4GABA-A receptors. Collectively, these findings provide evidence of a potential protective role for extrasynaptic \u03b4GABA-A receptors in catamenial-like seizures. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We found evidence of publication bias in the meta-analyses of comparisons for phenobarbitone versus placebo (eight studies) at 12 months but not at six months (six studies); and valproate versus placebo (four studies) at 12 months, with too few studies to identify publication bias for the other comparisons.Most of the reviewed antiepileptic drug trials are of a methodological quality graded as low or very low. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment often do not meet current standards; and treatment versus no treatment is more commonly seen than treatment versus placebo, leading to obvious risks of bias. Trials of antipyretics and zinc were of higher quality.",

Apparent benefit for clobazam treatment in one trial needs to be replicated to be judged reliable.

    "168": "During status epilepticus (SE), synaptic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAA Rs) become internalized and inactive, whereas spare N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) assemble, move to the membrane, and become synaptically active. When treatment of SE is delayed, the number of synaptic GABAA Rs is drastically reduced, and a GABAA agonist cannot fully restore inhibition. We used a combination of low-dose diazepam (to stimulate the remaining GABAA Rs), ketamine (to mitigate the effect of the NMDAR increase), and valproate (to enhance inhibition at a nonbenzodiazepine site) to treat seizures in a model of severe cholinergic SE. High doses of diazepam failed to stop electrographic SE, showing that benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance had developed. The diazepam-ketamine-valproate combination was far more effective in stopping SE than triple-dose monotherapy using the same individual drugs. Isobolograms showed that this drug combination's therapeutic actions were synergistic, with positive cooperativity between drugs, whereas drug toxicity was simply additive, without positive or negative cooperativity. As a result, the therapeutic index was improved by this drug combination compared to monotherapy. These results suggest that synergistic drug combinations that target receptor changes can control benzodiazepine-refractory SE.",

    "189": "Cannabis-induced acute psychotic-like states (CIAPS) represent a growing health issue, but their underlying neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines against CIAPS is limited by side effects and/or by their ability to tackle only certain aspects of psychosis. Thus, safer wide-spectrum treatments are currently needed. Although the blockade of cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) had been suggested as a therapeutical means against CIAPS, the use of orthosteric CB1 receptor full antagonists is strongly limited by undesired side effects and low efficacy. The neurosteroid pregnenolone has been recently shown to act as a potent endogenous allosteric signal-specific inhibitor of CB1 receptors. Thus, we tested in mice the potential therapeutic use of pregnenolone against acute psychotic-like effects of \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis. We found that pregnenolone blocks a wide spectrum of THC-induced endophenotypes typically associated with psychotic-like states, including impairments in cognitive functions, somatosensory gating and social interaction. In order to capture THC-induced positive psychotic-like symptoms (e.g. perceptual delusions), we adapted a behavioral paradigm based on associations between different sensory modalities and selective devaluation, allowing the measurement of mental sensory representations in mice. Acting at hippocampal CB1 receptors, THC impaired the correct processing of mental sensory representations (reality testing) in an antipsychotic- and pregnenolone-sensitive manner. Overall, this work reveals that signal-specific inhibitors mimicking pregnenolone effects can be considered as promising new therapeutic tools to treat CIAPS.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 21 February 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.4.",

Dexmedetomidine is likely the most appropriate preoperative anxiolytic as oral benzodiazepines are relatively contraindicated. Methohexital, though becoming less available at many institutions, remains the gold standard for induction of anesthesia for pediatric electroconvulsive therapy though ketamine, propofol, and sevoflurane are becoming increasingly viable options.

At chemical level, the GABAA /benzodiazepine complex is considered one of the main receptor systems involved in the modulation of stress-induced responses. Here, we describe the behavioral responses of two different lizard species, Liolaemus koslowskyi and Cnemidophorus tergolaevigatus exposed to three potential chronic stressful treatments: (a) high temperature, (b) forced swimming, and (c) simulated predator. Additionally, we aimed to determine in those lizards whether the central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR; an allosteric modulator site of the GABAA receptor) is related to adaptive responses to those stressful stimulations. Our results revealed that the simulated predator was the stress condition that showed the largest difference in behavioral responses between the two species, resembling previously described strategies in nature. The basal affinity of CBRs (obtained from undisturbed animals) showed differences between both species, and the simulated predator was the only stressor that altered the affinity of CBRs. L. koslowskyi CBRs showed a decreased receptor affinity, whereas C. tergolaevigatus showed an increased receptor affinity in comparison to their respective control groups. We show for the first time the effects of different types of stressors upon behavioral responses and CBR biochemical parameters in two lizard species. Our findings suggest a potential GABA/benzodiazepine role in the ability of lizards to cope with a repeated exposure to a stressful (e.g., predator) condition.",

Minipigs have increasingly been used in regulatory toxicology studies; however, no current FOB protocol is available for neurotoxicity testing in these species. Hence, a minipig FOB instrument was developed. A complete crossover study with Sinclair minipigs was performed to evaluate physiologic, neurologic, and behavioral effects of amphetamine, ketamine, and diazepam. The treated minipigs were first observed in their home cage, were video-recorded for 10 minutes in an open field, and then went through a complete neurologic examination. Both ketamine and diazepam were shown to reduce the freezing and behavior shifts of treated minipigs, while increasing their exploratory behaviors. Both drugs also caused muscular and gait impairment. The effects of ketamine and diazepam were consistent with their roles as central nervous system (CNS) suppressants. Unique effects were also observed with ketamine and diazepam treatments, which may reflect their unique mechanisms of action. Consistent with its role as a CNS stimulant, amphetamine caused the treated minipigs to be hyperactive and to display increased freezing and behavior shifts and reduced exploring activities. These effects of amphetamine were opposite to those observed with ketamine and diazepam. Amphetamine also increased locomotion in the treated minipigs. The present effects of amphetamine, ketamine, and diazepam are in agreement with observations by others. In conclusion, the minipig is a suitable species for FOB evaluation of pharmaceuticals in preclinical safety pharmacology testing.",

    "257": "Classical benzodiazepines, which are widely used as sedatives, anxiolytics and anticonvulsants, exert their therapeutic effects through interactions with heteropentameric GABAA receptors composed of two \u03b1, two \u03b2 and one \u03b32 subunit. Their high affinity binding site is located at the interface between the \u03b32 and the adjacent \u03b1 subunit. The \u03b1-subunit gene family consists of six members and receptors can be homomeric or mixed with respect to the \u03b1-subunits. Previous work has suggested that benzodiazepine binding site ligands with selectivity for individual GABAA receptor subtypes, as defined by the benzodiazepine-binding \u03b1 subunit, may have fewer side effects and may even be effective in diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism or chronic pain, that do not respond well to classical benzodiazepines. The distributions of the individual \u03b1 subunits across the CNS have been extensively characterized. However, as GABAA receptors may contain two different \u03b1 subunits, the distribution of the subunits does not necessarily reflect the distribution of receptor subtypes with respect to benzodiazepine pharmacology. In the present study, we have used in vivo [(18)F]flumazenil PET and in vitro [(3)H]flumazenil autoradiography in combination with GABAA receptor point-mutated mice to characterize the distribution of the two most prevalent GABAA receptor subtypes (\u03b11 and \u03b12) throughout the mouse brain. The results were in agreement with published in vitro data. High levels of \u03b12-containing receptors were found in brain regions of the neuronal network of anxiety. The \u03b11/\u03b12 subunit combinations were predictable from the individual subunit levels. In additional experiments, we explored in vivo [(18)F]flumazenil PET to determine the degree of receptor occupancy at GABAA receptor subtypes following oral administration of diazepam. The dose to occupy 50% of sensitive receptors, independent of the receptor subtype(s), was 1-2mg/kg, in agreement with published data from ex vivo studies with wild type mice. In conclusion, we have resolved the quantitative distribution of \u03b11- and \u03b12-containing homomeric and mixed GABAA receptors in vivo at the millimeter scale and demonstrate that the regional drug receptor occupancy in vivo at these GABAA receptor subtypes can be determined by [(18)F]flumazenil PET. Such information should be valuable for drug development programs aiming for subtype-selective benzodiazepine site ligands for new therapeutic indications.",

Setrons (5HT3 receptor antagonists), corticosteroids, and NK-1 receptor antagonists are the cornerstones of antiemetic therapy. Corticosteroids are one of the oldest agents in the prevention of CINV. They are highly effective, increase the effect of other antiemetic agents, and are cost-effective. The latest developed 5HT3 receptor antagonist palonosetron led to an update of the guidelines of CINV. Other types include benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, and olanzapine. Various factors contribute to the overall risk of developing CINV, such as patient characteristics, emetogenic potency of the chemotherapeutic agents, and correct prevention of CINV. Current guidelines determine which is the right preventive regimen for each cancer patient at risk for experiencing CINV.

Neurovascular complications include ischemic strokes, intracranial hemorrhage, or the development of traumatic arteriovenous fistulae. Delirium and encephalopathy have a reported incidence of 67-92% in mechanically ventilated polytrauma patients. Causes include sedation, analgesia/pain, medications, sleep deprivation, postoperative state, toxic ingestions, withdrawal syndromes, organ system dysfunction, electrolyte/metabolic abnormalities, and infections. Rapid identification and treatment of the underlying cause are imperative. Benzodiazepines increase the risk of delirium, and alternative agents are preferred sedatives. Pharmacologic treatment of agitated delirium can be achieved with antipsychotics. Nonconvulsive seizures and status epilepticus are not uncommon in surgical/trauma intensive care unit (ICU) patients, require electroencephalography for diagnosis, and need timely management. Spinal cord ischemia is a known complication in patients with traumatic aortic dissections or blunt aortic injury requiring surgery. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair has reduced the paralysis rate. Neuromuscular complications include nerve and plexus injuries, and ICU-acquired weakness. In polytrauma, the neurologic examination is often confounded by pain, sedation, mechanical ventilation, and distracting injuries. Regular sedation pauses for examination and maintaining a high index of suspicion for neurologic complications are warranted, particularly because early diagnosis and management can improve outcomes.", 
    "265": "Delirium is common in critically ill patients and associated with increased length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and long-term cognitive impairment. The pathophysiology of delirium has been explained by neuroinflammation, an aberrant stress response, neurotransmitter imbalances, and neuronal network alterations. Delirium develops mostly in vulnerable patients (e.g., elderly and cognitively impaired) in the throes of a critical illness. Delirium is by definition due to an underlying condition and can be identified at ICU admission using prediction models. Treatment of delirium can be improved with frequent monitoring, as early detection and subsequent treatment of the underlying condition can improve outcome. Cautious use or avoidance of benzodiazepines may reduce the likelihood of developing delirium. Nonpharmacologic strategies with early mobilization, reducing causes for sleep deprivation, and reorientation measures may be effective in the prevention of delirium. Antipsychotics are effective in treating hallucinations and agitation, but do not reduce the duration of delirium. Combined pain, agitation, and delirium protocols seem to improve the outcome of critically ill patients and may reduce delirium incidence.",
