    "0": "The development of anxioselective agents has made it possible to examine the biochemical basis of anxiety. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that benzodiazepines selectively enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. Subsequent work demonstrated the presence of a specific population of benzodiazepine binding sites on neuronal membranes. These sites appear to be linked to certain GABA receptors such that occupation of the benzodiazepine component reveals a group of GABA recognition sites that may be more sensitive to the neurotransmitter. These data, coupled with the findings that barbiturates may act, at least in part, by interacting with the GABA receptor-coupled chloride channel, suggest that pharmacological manipulations of the GABA system can alleviate the symptoms of anxiety. The anxioselectivity of the benzodiazepines may be related to the fact that they activate only a certain population of GABA receptors, whereas barbiturates can potentiate the majority of these sites. These discoveries point to the possibility that alterations in the GABA system may partially explain the neurochemical basis of anxiety.", 
    "1": "A post mortem case involving the triazolobenzodiazepine triazolam is reported. Levels of 38 ng/g in the liver and 6.7 ng/mL in the blood were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an eluent of 0.06% acetic acid:acetonitrile (61:39) and ultraviolet detection at 221 nm. The presence of triazolam in the post mortem samples was verified by its oxidation to a benzophenone with potassium dichromate, followed by the analysis of the oxidized extract by HPLC using a silica column and an eluent of dichloromethane:methanol (97.5:2.5) at 250 nm.", 
    "2": "Ten healthy volunteers aged 22 to 30 years received a single 20-mg oral dose of temazepam. Serum temazepam concentrations were measured by gas chromatography at multiple times during the next 48 hours. Mean kinetic variables were: volume of distribution, 1.45 liter/kg; elimination half-life, 8.6 hours; total clearance, 2.33 ml/min/kg. The subjects then received 20 mg temazepam once daily for seven consecutive days. Serum concentrations were measured just prior to each dose and at multiple time points after the last dose. Predose serum levels increased during the first three days of dosage, then increased no further. Mean values measured 24 hours after doses 1 through 6, respectively, were 33, 43, 55, 47, 53, and 51 ng/ml. Based on the area under the serum concentration curve after the last dose compared with that after the first dose, the mean accumulation ratio was 1.32, which was significantly greater than unity. The extent of accumulation was consistent with that predicted from the single-dose study. Postdosage washout half-life averaged 10.2 hours. Thus, temazepam has a pharmacokinetic profile of an intermediate half-life benzodiazepine that produces an intermediate degree of accumulation with multiple dosage.", 
    "3": "Experiments on rats were made to study the action of the derivatives of benzodiazepine (diazepam, 0.5 mg/kg and phenazepam, 0.1 mg/kg), and GABA (phenibut, 50 mg/kg, pantogam, 160 mg/kg, nicotinoyl-GABA, 500 mg/kg, piracetam, 1000 mg/kg) on the development of a traumatic brain edema. Diazepam, phenazepam and phenibut were demonstrated to produce a marked antiedematous action. The drugs made water content in the brain return to normal and reduced marked biochemical alterations in the brain. It is suggested that the protective action of the drug under study on the development of brain edema is linked with the action on the mediator structures and brain tissue metabolism.", 
    "4": "The neonatal pharmacokinetic and neurobehavioral properties of certain agents used in obstetric analgesia are reviewed (local anesthetics, opiates, inhalation agents, benzodiazepines). Fetal and neonatal pharmacokinetic alterations partly explain the neurobehavioral differences observed between different drug groups and ways of drug administration. The most effective and safest method with fewest neonatal neurobehavioral effects appears to be regional epidural analgesia performed with plain bupivacaine. The use of epidural opiates remains problematic. Inhalation agents and parenteral pethidine (meperidine) are still clinically useful alternative compounds in circumstances where epidural analgesia is not possible. Pharmacokinetically and according to neurobehavioral assessments, inhalation agents appear to be more attractive than pethidine. Benzodiazepines, especially after high or repeated doses, may cause the so-called floppy-infant syndrome, at least partly, due to a slow neonatal drug elimination.", 
    "5": "The relative bioavailability of a liquid oral form of 7-bromo-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-pyridyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (bromazepam, Lexotan, Lexotanil) in comparison with the conventional oral form (capsules) was investigated. The study was performed on six healthy volunteers who were administered both the drug products in a single oral dose of 3 mg of bromazepam in a randomized cross-over trial. An additional investigation was performed on the same subjects by administering the liquid oral solution at a lower dosage: 1.5 mg in order to confirm first-order kinetics at low dosage, too. The results showed the same bioavailability for the oral forms tested and confirmed first-order kinetics for the 1.5 mg dose, too.", 
    "6": "The hypnotic action and residual effects of a single bedtime dose of 7-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(3H)one (temazepam, Planum) were investigated in young, healthy adults. Two different doses of the drug (20 or 30 mg) or placebo were administered as soft-gelatin capsules 30 min before bedtime. Motor activity was recorded by a wrist-worn activity monitor. In comparison to placebo both doses of temazepam reduced night-time motor activity, an effect that was significant only for the first half of the night. After temazepam subjects rated their sleep as deeper and more quiet. A dose of 30 mg caused increased ratings of \"grogginess\" in the morning and at noon. There was no evidence for rebound insomnia in the 3 nights following drug intake. The results indicate that temazepam 20 mg in young adults has a reliable hypnotic effect without significant residual sequelae.", 
    "7": "A case is reported of delirium and seizures due to the abrupt withdrawal from the benzodiazepine alprazolam. Because of their short half-life, agents such as alprazolam may present a greater risk of withdrawal reactions than longer acting agents.", 
    "8": "One hundred and ninety-seven patients exhibiting a disturbed sleep pattern were recruited by thirty-five general practitioners into this single-blind randomized parallel group multicentre study. There were twelve patient withdrawals or drop-outs leaving sixty-one, sixty-three and sixty-one patients who, following 2 nights on placebo as baseline, completed 5 consecutive nights of treatment on loprazolam (1 mg), temazepam (20 mg) and placebo, respectively. Loprazolam and temazepam were found to have similar hypnotic activity with both treatments being superior to placebo. There was no statistical difference in the side-effect profile of the three treatment groups.", 
    "9": "The effect of three benzodiazepine compounds, diazepam, flunitrazepam, and clorazepate, on oxidative activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) was investigated. The oxidative activity of zymosan-stimulated PMN in the presence of three concentrations (10, 20, and 40 micrograms/ml) of these compounds was measured polarographically. In addition, zymosan-stimulated nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction was measured in the presence of various concentrations of flunitrazepam. All three compounds inhibited oxygen consumption of the PMN. The extent of inhibition was linear with respect to log-concentrations; oxygen consumption was reduced 50% for concentrations of diazepam, flunitrazepam, and clorazepate of 13 micrograms/ml, 56 micrograms/ml, and 285 micrograms/ml, respectively. In addition 30% and 100% inhibition of NBT reduction by flunitrazepam were observed at respective concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml and 60 micrograms/ml. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be determined.", 
    "10": "The use of cimetidine, the histamine H2 receptor antagonist, is associated with a relatively low incidence of adverse reactions. However, its liberal use has led to the identification of several clinically significant cimetidine-drug interactions that can lead to drug accumulation, toxicity, and life-threatening sequelae. A review of the literature and the clinical significance and physiologic basis of these interactions are presented. Recommended management of cimetidine-drug interactions is discussed.", 
    "11": "As a part of a study aiming to characterize the physiological and pharmacological significance of the high affinity pineal benzodiazepine (BZP) binding sites reported previously, we examined the uptake of the BZP derivative 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZP) by rat pineal glands in vitro. At 37 degrees C, 3H-radioactivity was taken up by tissue up to a pineal/medium concentration of about 12, while at 0 degrees C the uptake amounted to only one-third that at 37 degrees C. Reciprocal of uptake analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated apparent Km's of 1.74 and 1.45 microM, and Vmax's of 1.32 and 1.04 pmol per min per mg tissue, for control and superior cervical ganglionectomized rats, respectively, suggesting that the neural compartment does not participate significantly in 3H-FNZP uptake. Cerebral cortex explants of similar size and weight as the pineal ones took up 3H-FNZP to a maximum tissue/medium concentration of about 2. Neither pineal nor cerebral cortex 3H-radioactivity uptake exhibited significant changes as a function of time of day. A number of agents, including several BZP analogues, cocaine, desipramine, melatonin, fluoxetine, nomifensine, and dipiridamol, as well as changes in the ionic environment or metabolic inhibitors, did not affect 3H-FNZP uptake significantly. Other tissues, such as liver, muscle, kidney, adrenal gland, or anterior pituitary, took up 3H-radioactivity to tissue concentrations slightly lower than those of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that drug liposolubility accounted only to a limited extent for the high in vitro uptake detected in incubated pineals.", 
    "12": "Vietnam veterans with alcoholism and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are a clinically problematic population. Early self-medication of the PTSD with alcohol led for some to alcohol abuse and dependency. These may often be treated in an intensive alcoholism program. At evaluation both diagnoses are made, and patients are told that alcohol or drug use is not tolerated. The program first focuses on traditional alcoholism treatment issues. Early and consistent support to enhance self-esteem and to reduce guilt helps the patient later to tolerate the gradual investigation of the anger and self-loathing associated with both disorders. Important forces include family and peer support, effective limit setting in a structured milieu, supportive confrontation of alcoholic denial through multidisciplinary treatment in the absence of alcohol. Outpatient follow-up treatment groups include other PTSD sufferers and focus on establishing trust, interweaving the issues of adjustment to sobriety with discussion of the combat experience in a safe, accepting environment, with careful modulation of anxiety by the clinician. Medication must be conservative; benzodiazepines are not used after the detoxification period.", 
    "13": "Repeated electrical stimulations of the olfactory bulb led to the progressive development of a generalized epilepsy (kindling effect). One week after the last stimulation eliciting a stage 5 seizure, diazepam-(3H) binding was studied in olfactory bulb-kindled rats. Numbers of benzodiazepine receptors were increased in kindled olfactory bulb and amygdala. No significant change was observed in hippocampus. This modification could be considered as a response of the inhibitory mechanisms to repeated seizures which is insufficient to counteract the installation of the kindling effect.", 
    "14": "The efficacy of coupling between the benzodiazepine receptor and chloride channel as well as the coupling to the GABA receptor is differentially affected by different benzodiazepine ligands. In general, the order of efficacy with regard to allosteric effects of benzodiazepine ligands on the chloride channel ([35S]TBPS) and GABA receptor ([3H]muscimol), is: agonist greater than agonist/antagonist greater than partial agonist greater than antagonist; with inverse agonists acting in a manner opposite to the classical benzodiazepine agonists. The chloride ionophore is allosterically modulated both by benzodiazepine and GABA receptors.", 
    "15": "The possible interaction of melatonin with the GABAergic system at the receptor level was investigated. The effect of melatonin on the binding of the GABA agonist, [3H]muscimol, in crude synaptic membrane preparations was assayed. In fresh membrane preparations, melatonin increased [3H]muscimol binding in the rat striatum and frontal cortex. Treatment of membrane preparations with Triton X-100 appeared to abolish or depress the enhancing effect of melatonin. The use of Tris HCl as buffer appeared to be more effective than Tris-Citrate buffer suggesting a possible important ionic effect. The present findings suggest that melatonin is capable of enhancing [3H]muscimol binding in vitro, perhaps at the benzodiazepine-GABA-receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "16": "We have characterized and quantified specific binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam (FNZ; (benzodiazepine), [3H]-naloxone (NAL; (opiate) and [3H] CGP-12177(CGP; (beta-adrenergic) to thick slices (230-400 micron) of mouse and rat brain. The binding sites are stereospecific, saturable and of high affinity. In all cases, the binding of the ligands is readily reversible and demonstrates the appropriate drug specificity. In mouse brain [3H]-NAL binding is elevated by chronic treatment with naloxone (via capsules). We have been unsuccessful in quantifying beta adrenoreceptors with the archetypal ligand [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA). However, the use of [3H]-CGP 12177 enabled us to detect high-affinity beta adrenoreceptors in brain slices. [3H]-CGP also permits the demonstration of rapid and reversible agonist-induced down-regulation (internalization) of beta binding sites. We have been successful in quantifying beta adrenergic sites in single pineal glands of rat and hamster.", 
    "17": "The Du Pont PREP automated sample processor is a centrifugally based, microprocessor controlled instrument that was designed for extraction of samples from biological fluids. Extraction takes place in cartridges containing either organic resins or bonded silica packings as extraction sorbants. This paper will discuss the application of several lipophilic and ion exchange sorbants to the extraction of biological samples from body fluids. The advantages of these different types of sorbants will be compared and their performance with automated sample preparation will be shown. A variety of applications including the extraction of benzodiazepine, barbiturate, aminoglycoside and anticonvulsant drugs and their metabolites from serum, urine, and tissue homogenates will be discussed.", 
    "18": "The alkaloid 5,6,8,14-tetradehydro-4-hydroxy-3, 6-dimethoxy-17-methyl-morphinan-7-one[+/-)-salutaridine) was found to possess 3H-gamma-aminobutyric acid (3H-GABA) displacing activity (IC50 less than 1 mumol/l) in rat brain synaptic membranes. The enhancement of specific 3H-diazepam binding by increasing concentration of (+/-)-salutaridine follows a maximum curve indicating (+/-)-salutaridine to be a partial agonist at the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "19": "Recent methodological improvements in receptor autoradiography have enabled the in vitro and in vivo binding of the benzodiazepines in the brain to be visualized and pharmacologically characterized with an anatomical resolution unattainable by biochemical radioligand binding assays. This approach, combined with computerized microdensitometry, can be used not only to map the distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain but also to quantify their regional densities. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the solubilized and purified GABA/benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex, have revealed the distribution of antigenic sites on brain neurons and their processes. The brain regions of intense immunoreactivity are known to contain a high density of GABA-ergic efferents and neuronal-type benzodiazepine receptors. Current trends and prospects in this area of receptor research are briefly reviewed.", 
    "20": "Intracellular recordings were made from central Limulus and Helix neurones and extracellular recordings from rat cerebellar Purkinje cells and sympathetic ganglia. The actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ethylenediamine (EDA) and related analogues on these preparations were investigated. On Limulus neurones inhibited by GABA, EDA and piperazine were 81 and 186 times respectively less potent than GABA. Both the GABA and EDA events were chloride mediated, having similar reversal potentials and were reversibly antagonised by picrotoxinin. The EDA response persisted in high magnesium Ringer. On Helix neurones inhibited by GABA, EDA was 92 times less potent while on neurones excited by GABA, EDA was 9.25 times less potent. The other analogues tested had little or no GABA-like effect on either preparation. On rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, EDA was equipotent with GABA and both compounds were antagonised by bicuculline. Flurazepam only potentiated the action of EDA on 3 out of 23 cells tested while the GABA response of all 23 cells was potentiated by the benzodiazepine. Diaminopropionic acid was a weak inhibitor of cerebellar Purkinje cell firing but flurazepam potentiated this response in 6 out of 10 cells tested. On rat cervical ganglion neurones, EDA was half the potency of GABA and likewise the other analogues were less potent than GABA as depolarising agents. Incubation with glutamic acid decarboxylase inhibitors had no effect on the EDA response. Cross desensitisation between GABA and EDA was demonstrated using the ganglion preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The regional distribution of the binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzylate, 3H-dihydroergocryptine, 3H-dihydroalprenolol, 3H-serotonin and 3H-flunitrazepam was investigated in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, visual and frontal cortex of 25-day-old and adult rats. In adult rats the highest binding levels for the muscarinic acetylcholine and benzodiazepine receptor are present in the visual and frontal cortex, whereas alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor binding was highest in the retina and 3H-serotonin binding in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzylate, 3H-flunitrazepam and 3H-serotonin increases in the adult rats, whereas alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor binding is decreased compared to the binding levels found in 25-day-old animals. The distribution of the neurotransmitter receptors studied within the visual structures cannot be readily correlated with the pattern of some neurochemical presynaptic parameters.", 
    "22": "Benzodiazepine receptors appear to be pharmacologically important as the modulator of anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant activities in the central nervous system. The acute effects of valproic acid (VPA), diazepam (DZ), phenobarbital (PB), and phenytoin (PHT) on benzodiazepine receptor binding as measured by 3H-flunitrazepam were studied in Sprague Dawley (S/D) rat cerebral cortices. The acute effects of seizures were also studied in both S/D rats and audiogenic seizure rats. In the VPA (100 mg/kg, IP) treated rats, there was a 11% increase in benzodiazepine receptor density (Bmax). This effect appear to be dose dependent as higher doses of VPA (200-500 mg/kg) resulted in more increase in Bmax. No significant change occurred in Kd after acute VPA treatment. However, acute PB (100 mg/kg), PHT (100-200 mg/kg), or DZ (50 mg/kg) did not produce any changes in Bmax or dissociation constants (Kd). In S/D rats, significant increases in Bmax were observed 30 minutes after seizures induced by electroshock or pentylenetetrazol (50 mg/kg) IP injection. However, audiogenic seizure rats had higher Bmax prior to the induction of seizures when compared to normal S/D rats, and no changes in Bmax occurred after seizures in audiogenic seizure rats. No changes in Kd were seen in either S/D rats or audiogenic seizure rats before and after seizures. These data suggest that an increase in benzodiazepine receptor density might correlate with the mechanism of anticonvulsant action of VPA, and that a possible disorder of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex may be involved in the seizure susceptibility in audiogenic seizure rats.", 
    "23": "We report that membrane preparations of human myometrium possess binding sites for [3H] RO 5-4864, a specific ligand for the peripheral type of benzodiazepine receptors. Scatchard analysis shows a high-affinity binding site (Kd = 3.1 +/- 1.1 nM) and a class of low-affinity binding sites (Kd greater than 30nM) with positive cooperativity. Displacement and tryptic digestion experiments indicate that both these benzodiazepine binding sites are specific and proteic in nature. So benzodiazepines might exert their relaxant activity on uterine muscle directly at peripheral level through specific binding sites.", 
    "24": "A rapid and sensitive method is described for the determination of CGS-8216 (a pyrazoloquinoline that displaces benzodiazepines from their binding sites in the brain but which reverses some of the behavioural actions of the benzodiazepines) in plasma using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. CGS-9896 serves as the internal standard. The method is applied to a pharmacokinetic study of CGS-8216 in the rat. CGS-8216 was not detectable in plasma 24 h after a single IP administration of a 10 mg/kg dose. Animals treated with five once-daily injections of CGS-8216 had plasma concentrations 30 min after the final injection that were approximately four-times those observed 30 min after a single treatment. This suggests that caution must be used in the interpretation of results from experiments using multiple administrations of CGS-8216. The compound could not be detected in brain tissue at any of the time points studied.", 
    "25": "The discovery of high affinity, stereoselective binding sites for benzodiazepines (BZ) was a major step in understanding the molecular mechanism by which these widely used sedative/hypnotics exert their various pharmacologic effects. It has become clear that the BZ receptor complex has functional significance in terms of the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties of these widely used compounds. Until recently its role in the sleep-inducing properties has been unclear. This paper reviews a series of studies indicating that the BZ receptor complex does indeed mediate the hypnotic effects of flurazepam, and that these effects may involve alterations in calcium flow across neuronal membranes. Preliminary evidence also suggests that some pharmacologic properties of barbiturates may involve interactions with portions of the benzodiazepine receptor complex. Lethality from pentobarbital in mice, for instance, can be greatly reduced by treatment with IPPO, a compound which binds in relation to the chloride ionophore. The implications of sub-types of BZ receptors are discussed. Experience with some compounds which bind at the BZ receptor suggests that in the future drugs may become available which are much more specific for individual desired effects.", 
    "26": "Significant positive correlation between the ligand binding values for beta-adrenergic receptors and those for muscarinic cholinergic receptors was found in five inbred strains of mice (r = 0.84) and in different vertebrate species (r = 0.99). Comparative analysis of analogous receptor studies done on various brain regions in other laboratories revealed high positive correlation between regional binding values for these two receptors. In conjunction with the work presented here, an overlap in the genetic determination of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors is suggested.", 
    "27": "Dibutyryl cyclic GMP (DbcGMP) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DbcAMP) given to mice intracerebroventricularly in a dose of 200 or 400 nmol/head produced electroencephalographic and electromyographic changes corresponding to twitches, and clonic and tonic convulsions. Lower doses of DbcGMP or DbcAMP facilitated the pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic and tonic convulsions. Diazepam given intraperitoneally in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg suppressed clonic and tonic convulsions induced by DbcGMP and DbcAMP, but the twitches were not suppressed. These results suggest that these nucleotides lower the threshold for electrical discharges related to convulsion and facilitate the propagation of convulsion. Diazepam suppresses this facilitation.", 
    "28": "Ro 5-4864 is a 1,4 benzodiazepine which, atypically, does not bind to the classical CNS benzodiazepine receptors, but has high affinity for the peripheral type of binding site found both in the periphery and in the brain. Biochemical evidence for alternative sites of action for this compound is discussed. We review the behavioral profile of Ro 5-4864 (sedative, convulsant and anxiogenic in rodents) and also describe the behavioral effects of combining Ro 5-4864 treatment with benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) and with other drugs that modify the activity of benzodiazepines (Ro 15-1788, CGS 8216, picrotoxin, PK 11195, phenytoin). In the light of these interactions and electrophysiological evidence we conclude that the actions of Ro 5-4864 are most likely to be mediated at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the CNS.", 
    "29": "Acute metabolic acidosis associated with accumulation of lactate has been previously reported in isoniazid (INH) intoxication. To our knowledge, association of INH toxicity with beta-hydroxybutyric acidosis has not been demonstrated previously. The present report documents the occurrence of beta-hydroxybutyric acidosis in patients with INH intoxication. The reason for the lack of previous reports of this association is not clear, although failure to measure plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in previous studies is a likely possibility. Our patients received intravenous sodium bicarbonate, anticonvulsants and dialysis which resulted in complete reversal of metabolic acidosis and other manifestations of INH toxicity.", 
    "30": "The effects of acute administration of different psychotropic drugs on the human hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis were examined in six groups consisting of six healthy male subjects each, compared to placebo. Desimipramine (DMI) (50 mg IV) significantly stimulated ACTH secretion. DMI (25 and 50 mg IV) and chlorimipramine (CI) (25 mg IV) significantly stimulated cortisol, whereas neither sulpiride (100 mg IV) nor diazepam (10 mg IV) significantly affected secretion of cortisol, as compared to placebo. Since DMI primarily inhibits norepinephrine (NE) uptake and CI primarily that of serotonin (5-HT), whereas sulpiride is a dopamine(DA)-receptor blocker and diazepam a GABA-agonistic benzodiazepine derivative, NE and 5-HT uptake-inhibiting antidepressants seem to influence the HPA axis via the central nervous system.", 
    "31": "A behavioral study was made of the mechanisms underlying the aggressive behavior induced by high doses of clonidine in mice. The frequency of clonidine-induced aggressive responses such as attacking and biting was increased dose-dependently from 10 to 50 mg/kg. Aggressive behavior induced by clonidine at doses of 10-30 mg/kg was potentiated under conditions of isolation and food deprivation for 24 h. Clonidine (30 mg/kg)-induced aggressive behavior was attenuated by adenosine (10 mg/kg IP) or dipyridamole (10 mg/kg IP), but markedly antagonized by combined pretreatment with both drugs. The behavior was strongly reduced by potent adenosine analogs, such as N6-cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg IP) and N6-(L-phenyl isopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA, 0.2 mg/kg IP), but conversely was potentiated by phentolamine (10 mg/kg IP) or theophylline (10 mg/kg IP). Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg IP) and Ro15-1788 (2.5 mg/kg IP), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, also blocked the aggressive behavior. The inhibition by CHA (0.2 mg/kg IP) or diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) of clonidine-induced aggression was not antagonized by additional pretreatment with bicuculline (2 mg/kg IP). The aggressive response to apomorphine (8 mg/kg IP) was not affected by those drugs which inhibited the response to clonidine. The results suggest that the aggressive behavior evoked by high doses of clonidine, but not that by apomorphine, involves a blockade of adenosine receptors.", 
    "32": "This review describes animal models of anxiety that are able to identify an anxiogenic drug effect. Evidence is reviewed for the anxiogenic action of several drugs that act at the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ionophore complex in the brain. The effects of their combinations with various other drugs thought to act at the same sites are discussed. The classification of these drugs on the basis of their behavioural profiles is compared with their classification based on biochemical and electrophysiological studies.", 
    "33": "A general survey of receptor binding affinity data for 1,4-benzodiazepines, associated with the results of crystal structure determinations, quantum-mechanical calculations, structure-activity relationships and pharmacokinetic data, leads the authors to propose a new scheme for benzodiazepine-receptor interactions. 1,4-Benzodiazepines would interact with positively charged receptor sites by means of two hydrogen bonds accepted respectively by the carbonyl oxygen at position 2 and by the N4 atom of the diazepine ring. A third point of interaction would be given by the phenyl ring at C5 which would fit almost exactly in a hydrophobic pocket of the receptor.", 
    "34": "The use of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/receptor binding model to predict the onset and duration of the pharmacological effect of diazepam was explored. The analysis examined the effects of diazepam (0.28 mg/kg) on the wheel-tracking and digit-symbol substitution performance of young healthy adults. Both free-plasma drug concentration and relative amount of diazepam bound to the benzodiazepine receptor were calculated and compared to the behavioral measures across time. Performance was more significant correlated with relative receptor occupancy (RRO) than with unbound plasma-drug levels. For both tasks hysteresis plots indicated greater similarity between time profiles of performance and RRO than between those of performance and blood concentration alone. These results provide support for the inclusion of both receptor binding kinetics and plasma pharmacokinetics as the bases for the prediction of the pharmacologic activity of diazepam.", 
    "35": "We describe here biochemical and pharmacological effects of the beta-carboline ZK 93426 was compared with Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216, two compounds previously described as BZ receptor antagonists. Certain effects of ZK 93426, Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 were quite similar (e.g., 3H-FNM displacement, \"GABA ratio\", \"photo-shift\"). In most pharmacological tests ZK 93426 and Ro 15-1788 lacked overt effects; Ro 15-1788 was a weak agonist in some paradigms, while ZK 93426 exhibited a potent proconflict effect but also a weak anticonvulsant effect. This interesting finding with ZK 93426 suggests that BZ receptor ligands may possess differential efficacy at BZ receptor subtypes. In contrast, CGS 8216 exhibited potent proconvulsant effects in several paradigms in addition to proconflict and pentylenetetrazol generalizing effects. ZK 93426, Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 were almost equally potent as antagonists of the effects of BZ receptor agonists, such as diazepam and lorazepam. However, ZK 93426 was the most potent inhibitor of the convulsions produced by the BZ receptor inverse agonist DMCM.", 
    "36": "5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) is a potent and selective ligand for benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. Biochemical investigations indicate that ZK 91296 may be a partial agonist at BZ receptors. Such partial agonism may explain to some extent why ZK 91296 needs higher BZ receptor occupancy than diazepam for the same effect against chemical convulsants and for behavioural effects. The lack of sedative effects, and the very potent inhibition of reflex epilepsy, spontaneous epilepsy and DMCM-induced seizures suggest, furthermore, that ZK 91296 may possess pharmacological selectivity for a particular type of BZ receptor interaction, perhaps including topographic as well as receptor subtype differentiation.", 
    "37": "The discriminative stimulus properties of three beta-carboline derivatives were studied in three groups of rats trained, respectively, to discriminate diazepam (2.5 mg/kg IP), chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg IP) or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 15 mg/kg IP) from saline in standard procedures employing two-lever operant chambers. Two beta-carbolines, ZK 91296 and ZK 93423, substituted for the benzodiazepines in both CDP- and diazepam-trained rats. The neutral benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 blocked the diazepam discriminative stimulus and the ability of ZK 91296 to substitute for diazepam. A third beta-carboline, FG 7142, was not identified as benzodiazepine-like in generalization tests in either diazepam- or CDP-trained rats, but when administered together with CDP antagonized the benzodiazepine discriminative stimulus. In rats trained to discriminate PTZ from saline (a discrimination which is thought to depend on the anxiogenic properties of PTZ) the PTZ cue was antagonized by diazepam and ZK 93423, and partially antagonized by ZK 91296. The PTZ cue generalized to FG 7142 and this generalization was partially antagonized by Ro 15-1788. These results suggest that the three beta-carbolines provide more than one kind of discriminative stimulus, consistent with the classification of ZK 93423 as an agonist at central benzodiazepine receptors, with ZK 91296 as a partial agonist, and with FG 7142 as an inverse agonist. Pharmacologically, ZK 93423 and ZK 91296 may exhibit anxiolytic qualities, whereas FG 7142 produces anxiogenic effects.", 
    "38": "The influence of 2-(2-oxo-3-piperidyl)-1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one-1, 1-dioxide (supidimide), a representative of a new class of sedative drugs, on the noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuronal systems of rodent brains was investigated. In each case the brain transmitter levels after administration of supidimide were determined. Utilisation of noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NE), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was also investigated ex vivo. The study was complemented with in vitro investigations of biosynthesis, synaptosomal uptake, degradation, and receptor binding of the transmitters. Based on a preliminary study of the distribution of [35S]-supidimide in rat brain, in vitro effects observed at greater than 10(-4) mol/l were considered irrelevant. Similarly, in vivo effects requiring dosages higher than 300 mg/kg i.p. were not regarded adequate to explain the sedative and antiaggressive efficacy of supidimide. With the above restrictions, the following parameters can be rated as not influenced by supidimide: levels of tryptophan in rat brain and serum (free and total); 5-HT biosynthesis in vivo (rat brain; 5-HT accumulation after monoamine oxidase (MAO) blockade); activity of MAO-A and MAO-B (rat brain mitochondria); uptake of 5-HT, NE and DA (rat synaptosomes); 5-HT receptor binding ( [3H]-LSD binding assay in rat cortical membranes); tyrosine hydroxylase activity (rat adrenal glands); catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) (rat liver); NE binding to central alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors (rat brain; radioligand assay with [3H]-dihydroergocryptine, [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-WB 4101 (2',6'-dimethoxy-(G-3H]-phenoxy]-ethylaminomethylbenzo-1,4-dioxane ); DA levels (whole rat brain and striata); dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels (whole rat brain without cerebellum and striata); elevated DOPAC levels after pretreatment with haloperidol; DA-dependent adenylate cyclase in vitro (rat striatum); D2 receptor binding ( [3H]-spiperone binding assay, rat striatum); GABA levels (mouse brain); GABA transaminase activity (mouse brain stem); sodium-independent [3H]-GABA receptor binding (rat brain) and benzodiazepine binding (rat cortical membranes, [3H]-diazepam binding assay). Two effects on the GABAergic system were induced by supidimide. Starting at 300 mg/kg i.p., supidimide slowed down the GABA accumulation in brains of aminooxyacetate-treated mice. At 10(-4) mol/l supidimide caused a significant inhibition of GABA uptake (rat synaptosomes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The purines inosine and hypoxanthine have been implicated in neurobiological effects associated with benzodiazepine-receptor occupancy, and may be endogenous ligands of benzodiazepin receptors. The behavioral effects of purinergic activation upon anxious behaviors have been less well characterized and understood. We present evidence that purinergic stimulation is sufficient to produce an operationally defined conditioned anxiety response, and that the effect is specific to the benzodiazepine receptor. These findings suggest anxiogenic potency for purines, which may be associated with their normal behavioral and motivational mode of action.", 
    "40": "The effects of diazepam and Ro 15-1788 were assessed upon responses of mouse spinal cord (SC) neurons in cell culture to the amino acid neurotransmitters 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and S-glutamic acid. Diazepam (100 nM) enhanced GABA responses by 65 +/- 3% (113 cells), while Ro 15-1788 (100 nM) failed to alter GABA responses but reduced their enhancement by diazepam. Higher Ro 15-1788 concentrations (1 microM or 10 microM) enhanced GABA responses to a moderate extent, while blocking further enhancement of GABA by diazepam. Neither diazepam nor Ro 15-1788 affected glutamate responses or resting membrane potential or conductance of spinal cord neurons. These results provide electrophysiological support for partial agonist, rather than pure antagonist, activity of Ro 15-1788.", 
    "41": "In rats submitted to acute stress by forced swimming there was an immediate sharp decline in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and of [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate in synaptosomal membranes of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. This was followed by a rebound increase in benzodiazepine receptors after 60 min, specially in the hippocampal formation. These two changes were blocked by chronic treatment with diazepam for 14 days (4 mg/kg/day). On the other hand, long-term treatment with the antagonist RO 15-1788 did not modify the changes caused by the acute stress. These findings are discussed in relation to the possible regulation of benzodiazepine receptors by agonists and antagonists.", 
    "42": "The cellular content and secretion of intrinsic factor was measured by [57Co]cyanocobalamin binding using isolated rat gastric mucosal cells. The intrinsic factor/R-protein ratio was above 9:1 as evaluated by specific anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. In unfractionized cells with 23 +/- 1.3% parietal cells the intrinsic factor content of 148 +/- 47 fmol/10(6) cells remained almost unchanged over 3 h, whereas basal secretion rose up to 57 +/- 10. In fractionized cells (Percoll) with 3-85% parietal cells most intrinsic factor was found in the parietal cell-depleted fraction (content: 441 +/- 30, secretion/3 h: 139 +/- 16, mean formation/h: 50 +/- 12 fmol/10(6) cells). The intrinsic factor content of the different cell fractions correlated with that of pepsin. [14C]Aminopyrine uptake, an indirect measure of parietal cell H+ production, was inversely related. Carbachol (1 X 10(-6)-10(-3) mol/l) stimulated intrinsic factor secretion, 1 X 10(-3) mol/l being maximally effective (90 +/- 8% above basal). This response was inhibited by atropine and pirenzepine, but not by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and somatostatin. Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP, 43 +/- 7%) and hexoprenaline (24 +/- 5%) enhanced intrinsic factor secretion less effectively and pentagastrin like histamine lacked any stimulatory effect. We conclude that in the rat intrinsic factor is produced and released from chief cells mainly under cholinergic control.", 
    "43": "Diazepam, a depressant benzodiazepine, produced a dose-dependent decrease in the spontaneous motility of 5-day embryos while Ro 5-3663, a convulsant benzodiazepine, had no apparent effect. Diazepam and 4 other benzodiazepines inhibited motility in 5-day embryos with a potency that paralleled their effectiveness in ligand-binding studies. Ro 11-5073/Ro 11-5231, depressant benzodiazepine enantiomers, stereospecifically inhibited motility in 4- and 5-day embryos. Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, reversed the decrease in the motility of 4- and 5-day embryos caused by a depressant benzodiazepine, clonazepam. Ro 5-6945, a potent agonist for the non-neuronal (but not the neuronal) benzodiazepine receptor, had no apparent effect on motility in 5-day embryos. Benzodiazepine receptors appear at least as early as day 5 (and perhaps as early as day 4) in the chick embryo.", 
    "44": "The effect of intravenous midazolam 0.3 mg/kg on lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure was studied in 8 healthy volunteers. No effect on LOS pressure was noted. The importance of this finding in relation to the possible danger of gastro-oesophageal reflux and pulmonary aspiration of gastric acid content during induction of general anaesthesia is discussed.", 
    "45": "A gas chromatographic method (GLC) using a capillary column, electron capture (EC) detection and a solid injection system for the determination of midazolam and brotizolam in plasma is described. Furthermore, the application of a radioreceptor technique (RRA), using a dry and stable benzodiazepine receptor preparation and 3H-flunitrazepam as a labelled ligand for the assay of both drugs is presented. A comparison was made between the RRA and the GLC method. For the gas chromatographic method, linear calibration graphs (r greater than 0.995) was obtained in the range of 0.1 -0.5 ng of brotizalam, and 1.0-5.0 ng of midazolam. Differences between duplicates were less than 8%. The relative affinity of the 1-hydroxymethyl and 4-hydroxy metabolites of brotizolam and midazolam were 0.33 and 0.14 respectively for brotizolam and 0.64 and 0.23 for midazolam. Extraction yields of parents drugs and metabolites were similar. Application of the methods to pharmacokinetic studies of the drugs indicated that they were sufficiently sensitive to measure plasma concentrations for at least three times the elimination half-lives. There was a good correlation between results obtained with the gas chromatographic method and those obtained with the receptor technique. Correlation coefficients were 0.94 (based on 37 samples) for brotizolam and 0.99 (based on on 33 samples) for midazolam, and there were no significant differences between pharmacokinetic parameters obtained with the two methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "In relation to the phototoxicity of 7-chloro-I,4-benzodiazepine-N-oxides the photostability of some of these N-oxides and the thermostability of their photoproducts, the oxaziridines, were studied. Rather than a consequence of a direct phototoxic effect by the N-oxides the ultimate toxic effect in the test system Salmonella typhimurium appeared to be caused by products formed during and after the irradiation. For chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) and its main metabolites in man desmethylchlordiazepoxide (DES) and demoxepam (DEM) the formation of an oxaziridine is indeed a crucial factor for the onset of the toxic effect. However, DEM oxaziridine (DEM OX.) being very thermolabile in protic medium forms non-toxic conjugates with the solvent. CDZ OX. and DES OX. are thermally converted into their N-oxide, although DES OX. partly decomposes into 6-chloro-4-phenylquinazoline-2-carboxaldehyde as well. This compound proved to be an important factor in the toxic action of DES after irradiation.", 
    "47": "Murine brain cells differentiated for 19 days in culture before treatment for 5 days with 10 microM diazepam. Radioligand binding to the benzodiazepine receptors on membranes obtained from these cultures was determined by the filtration assay method. Decreased binding was observed in the membranes from treated cultures relative to untreated cells. However, this decrease appears to be due, at least in part, to competition from residual drug in the assay system despite extensive cell and membrane rinses. These data emphasize the difficulty in ascribing the mechanism of benzodiazepine tolerance observed clinically with chronic treatment to receptor down-regulation as determined by binding assays.", 
    "48": "Several classes of centrally acting convulsant, depressant, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic drugs modulate GABAergic transmission. The postsynaptic receptor with which these drugs interact is an allosteric complex with distinct binding sites for GABA, benzodiazepines, picrotoxinin and related compounds. Convulsants which inhibit GABA transmission (except bicuculline) inhibit competitively the binding of dihydropicrotoxinin (DHP) or t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPT) to the picrotoxinin site and prevent the allosteric enhancing effect of depressant drugs on GABA and benzodiazepine binding. Depressant drugs give a mixed inhibition of TBPT binding. The possible topography of the picrotoxinin site and its relationship to convulsant/depressant drug action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-ionophore complex is discussed.", 
    "49": "The effects of chronic perinatal or postnatal administrations of diazepam on opiate receptor development in cerebral cortex and striatum were studied at two different post-treatment ages, using tritiated ethylketocyclazocine, the prototypic kappa-opiate, for measurements of opiate binding site ontogeny. Prenatal plus postnatal exposure to diazepam markedly decreased the total number of binding sites for [3H]ethylketocyclazocine in the rat cerebral cortex and striatum at 14 days of age. Postnatal diazepam treatment alone did not alter [3H]ethylketocyclazocine binding site development in cortex or striatum. These results suggest that development of opiate receptors in rat brain can be altered by prenatal exposure to diazepam.", 
    "50": "Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) was found to inhibit the firing rate of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN-PR) cells by 50%. In contrast, beta-CCM, at the doses of 125 and 250 micrograms/kg i.v. increased the firing rate by 90 and 150%, respectively, while DMCM produced similar increases at doses of 250 and 500 micrograms/kg i.v. Both beta-carboline-induced excitation and diazepam-induced inhibition were reversed to baseline values by the specific antagonist of benzodiazepine recognition sites, Ro15-1788 (2.0 mg/kg i.v.). Moreover, the stimulant effect of beta-carbolines was also reversed by diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) to about 50% of baseline. The results indicate that beta-carbolines specifically influence the activity of SN-PR cells through a mechanism opposite to that of benzodiazepines themselves, acting on benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "51": "Some convulsant drugs elicit CNS excitation by blocking neuronal activity at GABAergic synapses whereas depressant compounds may result in the enhancement of GABAergic transmission. These effects are thought to involve drug actions at a multireceptor complex involving a benzodiazepine receptor, GABA receptor, picrotoxin receptor and a chloride ionophore. A radiolabeled convulsant, [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]-TBT) has been developed and used to characterize the binding to the \"picrotoxin\" or convulsant/barbiturate site. The microscopic distribution of the convulsant/barbiturate sites are reported in this communication, as demonstrated by receptor autoradiography after labeling tissue sections with [35S]-TBT. Comparison of the distribution of these sites with those of the benzodiazepine receptors show a close regional correlation in many areas. The convulsant/barbiturate sites and the benzodiazepine receptors, however, are unevenly distributed in the rat cerebellum and exist in separate lamina.", 
    "52": "Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist increases, and DMCM, an inverse agonist decreases the stimulation by etazolate or pentobarbital of [3H] muscimol binding to membranes of rat cerebral cortex. Ro 15-1788 has no marked effects but antagonizes the action of both flunitrazepam and DMCM. The investigation of several drugs acting on benzodiazepine receptors on etazolate enhancement of [3H] muscimol binding suggests that their receptor interaction reflects a spectrum from agonists to inverse agonists.", 
    "53": "The effect of pirenzepine, an anticholinergic agent, on GH release induced by L-dopa (500 mg po), apomorphine (0.75 mg sc), and clonidine (0.150 mg iv) administration was studied in a group of normal men. Pirenzepine, a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, completely blocked the GH rise induced by dopamine- and adreno-receptor stimulation. In contrast, the PRL-inhibiting action of L-dopa was not modified by the cholinergic antagonist. The data suggest that acetylcholine and its receptors are important regulators of the neurosecretory mechanisms that control GH secretion in man.", 
    "54": "Experiments were performed to study the effect of chronic emotional painful stress on oxidative phosphorylation in different structures of rat brain at varying times of the development as well as after pretreatment with psychotropic agents. During the stage of excess catabolism, stress was demonstrated to dramatically inhibit and dissociate oxidative phosphorylation. This led to the impairment of macroerg synthesis and to the reduction of the brain macroerg content. Prophylactic administration of the derivatives of nicotinic acid and GABA markedly stimulated oxidative phosphorylation making it return to the initial level. Mebicar and meprobamate were less powerful. Chlorodiazepoxide aggravated stressful effects on tissue respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. It has been demonstrated that energy metabolism of the brain may return to normal at the expense of stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation.", 
    "55": "A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for diazepam disposition was developed in the rat, incorporating anatomical, physiological, and biochemical parameters, i.e., tissue volume, blood flow rate, serum free fraction, distribution of diazepam into red blood cells, drug metabolism and tissue-to-blood distribution ratio. The serum free fraction of diazepam was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C and was constant over a wide concentration range. Partition of diazepam between plasma and erythrocytes was determined in vitro at 37 degrees C, and the resultant blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was constant over a wide concentration range. The enzymatic parameters (Km, Vmax) of the eliminating organs, i.e., liver, kidney, and lung, previously determined using microsomes, were used for the prediction. The tissue-to-blood distribution ratios inferred by inspection of the data when pseudoequilibrium is reached after i.v. bolus injection of 1.2 mg/kg diazepam were corrected according to the method of Chen and Gross. Predicted diazepam concentration time-course profiles in plasma and various organs or tissues, using an 11-compartmental model, were compared with those observed. Prediction was successful in all compartments including brain, the target organ of diazepam. Scale-up of the disposition kinetics of diazepam from rat to man was also successful.", 
    "56": "Four infants had agyria confirmed by CT scan. All were mentally retarded, microcephalic, 3 of them having characteristic facial dysmorphy and 2 infantile spasms. EEG was characterized by very high amplitude rhythms in the alpha range, associated with delta waves and with infrequent spikes. The tracing was poorly modified by sleep. Drugs reduced its amplitude and rapid rhythms appeared with benzodiazepines. The authors point to the usefulness of the EEG in suggesting diagnosis before the CT scan, as was the case in 2 patients. They point to the urgent need of studying infantile epilepsies according to etiology, and not only to seizure types.", 
    "57": "The authors have studied 51 cases of SSPE, mainly focusing their attention upon clinical and EEG signs of the onset of the illness. Clinical disorders have been classified in the 3 following categories: psychic prevailing, neurologic prevailing, and visual disorders prevailing. These 3 categories do not have the same evolution and may not have the same prognosis. Concerning EEG disorders, the typical periodic complex topography allows to recognize 3 groups: bilateral and symmetrical complexes, bilateral but asymmetrical complexes, and unilateral complexes. These 3 groups may be further analysed, according to an anterior or posterior prevalence of the periodic complex. The authors think that this distinction may be of interest for diagnostic precision.", 
    "58": "Selected behavioral and physiological effects of maintenance on (--)-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) were examined for 67 men beginning LAAM maintenance. Thirty-four began LAAM maintenance after 1 month or more on methadone; 33 others were using street heroin immediately before beginning LAAM. Subjects were followed for 20 weeks on LAAM; assessment focused on changes in alcohol and diazepam use, sexual behavior and testicular function, and cardiovascular function. There was a trend toward increased alcoholism-related behaviors, but not consumption of alcohol, when on LAAM. Use of diazepam remained low. Subjects reported slightly enhanced sexual activity: reported number of ejaculations tended to increase, although interest in sexual activity remained constant. Semen volume values remained in the low normal range. In contrast to an earlier published report of reduced sperm motility in methadone and heroin users, normal motility was noted in this sample. The incidence of abnormal sperm morphology decreased from baseline to the end of the study. Cardiovascular function, as assessed by response to standard exercise, was unchanged during LAAM maintenance. Electrocardiograms revealed minor abnormalities prior to beginning LAAM maintenance; but these abnormalities did not consistently change during treatment. There is little evidence that the effects of LAAM maintenance differ from the effects of methadone maintenance on these behavioral and physiological functions.", 
    "59": "Whether or not zopiclone, a new sleep-inducing drug, exerted a similar effect to that of benzodiazepines was examined. The drug inhibited crossed extensor reflexes in chicks and augmented the dorsal root-dorsal root reflexes in rats without affecting the mono- and polysynaptic reflexes. The site of its action was considered to be located in the spinal cord since the effect on the dorsal root reflex was observed also in the spinal rats. Zopiclone selectively reduced the phasic responses of anemic decerebrate rigidity like benzodiazepines in rats. Despite the structural difference from the benzodiazepines, zopiclone dose-dependently inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding in rat brain membranes, although the potency was weaker. These results suggested that zopiclone exerts CNS actions via benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "60": "Influences of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) on GABA agonists-induced gastric acid secretion were studied in anesthetized rats. GBL potentiated the effect of GABA and GABA agonists on gastric acid secretion, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, a metabolite of GBL, tended to enhance the effect of GABA. However, GBL did not influence 2-deoxy-D-glucose- or bethanechol-stimulated acid secretion. A benzodiazepine, diazepam, also increased the secretagogue action of baclofen. A GABA antagonist, bicuculline, but not picrotoxin, inhibited the acid secretion stimulated by the combination of GBL and GABA or muscimol. Aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of GABA transaminase, potentiated the effect of GABA. Dopamine receptor agonists and antagonist did not modify the effect of GABA. Neither GABA mimetic action of GBL nor its influences on the dopaminergic system are involved in the effect of the compound on gastric acid secretion. Although the possibility that GBL inhibits GABA degradation is not excluded, the compound appears to increase the sensitivity of GABA receptor to GABA mimetics in the gastric acid secretion.", 
    "61": "The effects of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), bicuculline and amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA) on nitrazepam-induced sleep were studied in young chicks. GABA (200-3200 mg/kg) induced a marked sedation in young chicks. It also potentiated nitrazepam (1.6 mg/kg)-induced sleep. Bicuculline (1.25-5.00 mg/kg) effectively antagonized nitrazepam-induced sleep. In addition, it effectively antagonized GABA (1600 mg/kg)-induced potentiation of nitrazepam sleep. AOAA (2.5-7.5 mg/kg) delayed the onset of nitrazepam sleep, but significantly prolonged its duration. Nitrazepam (1.6 mg/kg) synchronized the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the hyperstriatum, optic tectum and reticular formation. Similarly, the electromyograph (EMG) activity was markedly reduced. GABA (1600 mg/kg) synchronized the EEG of the hyperstriatum, optic tectum and reticular formation while the EMG activity was reduced. Administration of GABA (1600 mg/kg) into nitrazepam (1.6 mg/kg)-pretreated chicks induced desynchronization of the EEG of the hyperstriatum, while the EEG of the reticular formation was synchronized. In addition, the EMG activity was reduced. Bicuculline (5 mg/kg) activated the EEG of the hyperstriatum; this effect was antagonized by GABA (1600 mg/kg). Similarly, GABA (1600 mg/kg)-induced decrease in EMG activity, synchronization of the EEG of the optic tectum and reticular formation was antagonized by bicuculline. The present data suggest that GABA potentiated nitrazepam-induced behavioral and electroencephalographical sleep.", 
    "62": "Lormetazepam, a new short-acting benzodiazepine, was studied in 30 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (10 patients before induction of anaesthesia, 8 patients before extracorporeal circulation, 12 patients during extracorporeal circulation). Before induction of anaesthesia lormetazepam caused only a small reduction in CI, heart rate and a moderate hypoventilation. During anaesthesia (fentanyl, pancuronium bromide, ventilation with N2O/O2 1: 1) there was a decrease in CI (26%), SI (18%), HR (5,7%), dp/dt (15%) and an increase in TSR (25%) and TPR (32%); Part, PAP, PCWP and PRA remained unchanged. There was a small decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. During ECC lormetazepam increased the arterial perfusion pressure (20%); the priming volume of the oxygenator decreased by 48% at the same time, indicating venous pooling.", 
    "63": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the absorption of clonazepam administered rectally. 10 adult non-epileptics were given 0.02 mg clonazepam/kg body weight, and blood samples were drawn 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min after administration. The concentrations were measured by gas-chromatography. To gain an impression of the serum concentration after intravenous administration, 2 persons were given 1 mg clonazepam and blood samples were drawn and analyzed in the same way as after rectal administration. Peak values occurred 10 to 30 min after rectal administration; the values were between 18 and 57 nmol/l. After intravenous administration, the values were very high within the first 10-15 min; hereafter the concentrations were about the same level as the peak values after rectal administration, indicating that clonazepam is well-absorbed after rectal administration and can be used in the treatment of status epilepticus, possibly in larger doses than those used in this study.", 
    "64": "35S-thiopental 15 mg/kg and 14C-diazepam 5 mg/kg were injected intravenously in separate groups of rats (n = 6) at 1 ATA air and at 71 ATA air-He. Total radioactivity was measured in the brain, liver, kidney, muscle and fat after 1, 3, 5 and 15 min. The thiopental content was significantly reduced at pressure in the brain at 3, 5 and 15 min. The diazepam content of the brain was significantly reduced at pressure at 1, 5 and 15 min. The liver, muscle and kidney tissue generally contained slightly less of either drug at pressure, particularly at the earliest sampling times.", 
    "65": "Two interactive, computer-controlled tests--critical flicker fusion and discriminant reaction time tasks--are described. These tasks, and subjective sedation ratings using visual analogue scales, were shown to be sensitive in a dose-related fashion to the effects of CNS depressants (diazepam, 15 mg and lorazepam, 1 and 2 mg). Such brief, interactive, computerized tasks should be useful in screening new agents for CNS activity in humans.",

The interrelationship, via feedback between central dopaminergic and gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) systems is reviewed. A theoretical role for a relative DA-GABA imbalance during NMS and treatment implications are discussed.", 
    "68": "Although clinically relevant, drug-protein interactions in the morbidly obese population have not been studied thoroughly. The objective of this study was to evaluate serum chemistry profiles and the degree of serum protein binding of propranolol, diazepam and phenytoin in the serum of four female, morbidly obese (greater than 190% of ideal body weight) and eight control female subjects. Serum triglyceride concentrations were higher and high-density lipoproteins were lower in the obese subjects than in the control group. Serum albumin and total protein concentrations in the obese were not different from controls. Unexpectedly, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations were doubled in the obese subjects (mean obese value 121 mg/100 ml vs 62.9 mg/100 ml for the control subjects). Obese subjects had a mean fraction unbound (fu) for propranolol of 0.086, which was significantly different from the controls (fu = 0.123). The binding of diazepam was decreased slightly in the obese subjects. The binding of phenytoin was similar in both groups. The altered serum chemistry of obesity may play a significant role in the drug management of the obese patient by altering drug-protein interactions.", 
    "69": "The kinetics of clobazam taken 3 h before, during, and 3 h after a standard hospital meal were studied in six healthy volunteers. Peak plasma levels were significantly lower when the drug was taken with or after meals suggesting that the rate of absorption was reduced by food. The mean area under the concentration vs time curve was not affected by the time of drug administration indicating that the meal had no effect upon the extent of absorption.", 
    "70": "The effect of once weekly administration of lorazepam (2.5 mg) to benzodiazepine-naive student volunteers was assessed in a number of performance tests and on self-ratings. Tolerance developed to the effects of lorazepam on finger-tapping and on self-ratings of dizziness. No tolerance was observed to the drug-induced impairment in a nonsense-syllable paired associate learning test or to the effects on self-ratings of sedation or on heart rate. It is suggested that the reduced impairment in the digit-symbol substitution test observed in weeks 2 and 3 of lorazepam treatment was due to a 'masked' practice effect rather than to tolerance. Test-retest correlation coefficients were calculated for all the tests used. The effect of lorazepam in each test was also correlated with its effect in the other tests. There were significant correlations in performance on placebo in the finger-tapping (r = 0.66), digit-symbol substitution (r = 0.94), symbol copying (r = 0.96) and nonsense-syllable learning (r = 0.74) tests. It is suggested that benzodiazepine experience should be given to drug-naive subjects before they are used in cross-over experiments that involve this class of compound, since the major change in impairment occurred between the first and second exposure to lorazepam.", 
    "71": "Intramuscular midazolam is better absorbed than when given orally. Addition of hyaluronidase to the injection significantly increases uptake but causes a high incidence of pain at the injection site. Concurrent administration of oral midazolam and metoclopramide does not increase its uptake.", 
    "72": "The effects of various doses of pentylenetetrazol, clonidine, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam on limb and head movement and behavioral seizure signs were examined in 4-, 8- and 16-day old rats tested at ambient temperatures of either 25 or 35 degrees C. All 4 drugs produced intense behavioral activation at the 2 younger ages but there were marked differences among them in the effects of test temperature on this activation and in the relationship between age and their activating effect. A \"paradoxical\" and intense behavioral energization was observed after the administration of either of the 2 benzodiazepines at 4, 8 but not 16 days, particularly at the lower test temperature. Clonidine and pentylenetetrazol were activating at all 3 ages but while clonidine had greater effect at the low test temperature, the opposite was the case after pentylenetetrazol. The effects of the benzodiazepines and clonidine were clearly distinct from those of pentylenetetrazol and this was the only drug to substantially elicit seizure signs. It is uncertain whether or not the benzodiazepines cause brain seizures in young animals. If so, then their behavioral manifestation is clearly different from that observed after pentylenetetrazol.",

The convulsant action of 3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline has been previously demonstrated to be mediated via an interaction with C.N.S. benzodiazepine receptors. The characteristics of the benzodiazepine receptor from the two strains appeared to be identical with respect to both binding affinity and capacity for [3H]3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline and [3H]diazepam, as well as the relative decreases in apparent receptor affinity for [3H] 3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline in the presence of 10 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid. Although the rate of degradation of 3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline in plasma was similar in the two strains, a marked difference in brain levels of the drug (or an active metabolite) was observed after in vivo administration. These results suggest that pharmacokinetic, rather than pharmacodynamic factors are primarily responsible for the observed strain differences in sensitivity to 3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline.", 
    "74": "The rate of paracetamol absorption after oral administration was used as a model of drug absorption and as an indirect measure of the rate of gastric emptying in 37 patients awaiting elective general surgery after different premedications. After saline (control) and diazepam, paracetamol absorption was normal but after morphine or nefopam, absorption was delayed markedly, presumably as a result of delayed gastric emptying. After naloxone there was a small but insignificant delay.", 
    "75": "In vivo specific binding of [3H]diazepam was not altered by a single electroconvulsive shock given 5, 30, or 60 min, or 24 h previously, nor 24 h after the last of 10 daily shocks. Similarly, in vivo [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline carboxylate binding was not changed in the brains of animals that had been given a single electroconvulsive shock 30 min previously or a series of 10 daily shocks. Brain areas examined included cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum. However, cortical binding of [3H]diazepam was increased by 32% in animals which were present in the same room while another was being injected and killed. This may represent a response to stress and/or anxiety.", 
    "76": "Five clinically available 1,4-benzodiazepines (BDZs) (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and clonazepam) and four investigational 1,4-BDZs (BDZ I, BDZ II, BDZ III, and BDZ IV) were tested in vivo for minimal neurotoxicity (TD50) and for ability to obtund seizures (ED50) induced by a battery of five well-standardized procedures (maximal electroshock, strychnine, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, and picrotoxin). In addition, these BDZs were also tested in vitro as inhibitors of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to BDZ receptors. The results with each of the six in vivo tests were compared with those with the in vitro receptor binding test, and the correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. There was a high correlation between the inhibitor constants (Ki) derived from BDZ binding studies and the TD50 values (r = 0.882) and the pentylenetetrazol ED50 values (r = 0.946). There was also good correlation between ED50 values of BDZs effective by the bicuculline and picrotoxin tests and their Ki values in the BDZ receptor binding studies (r = 0.868 and 0.892, respectively). However, BDZ I, BDZ II, and BDZ IV had Ki values of 1.830, 0.075, and 0.015 microM, respectively, but BDZ I was ineffective in nontoxic doses by the bicuculline and picrotoxin tests, BDZ II by the picrotoxin test, and BDZ IV by the bicuculline test. In contrast, there was no correlation between the BDZs' anticonvulsant potency, determined by either the maximal electroshock or strychnine test, and their inhibitory potency on [3H]flunitrazepam binding to receptor sites. The possible methodological and neurochemical bases for these differences are discussed. These studies indicate that BDZ binding studies can be used to screen BDZs for anticonvulsant activity (selectively for antipentylenetetrazol activity and less selectively for antibicuculline and antipicrotoxin activity). More importantly, they complement the conventional in vivo anticonvulsant threshold tests. Therefore, BDZ binding studies can be used in concert with conventional in vivo procedures for the pharmacological differentiation of candidate antiepileptic BDZs."
