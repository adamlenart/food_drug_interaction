    "9": "We investigated the in vivo effects of Vietnamese ginseng saponin (VG saponin) and its major component majonoside-R2 (MR2) on psychological stress-induced enhancement of lipid peroxidation in the mouse brain. Psychological stress exposure using a communication box system for 4 h significantly increased the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), an index of lipid peroxidation activity, in the brain. Pretreatment with VG saponin (15-25 mg/kg, PO) and MR2 (1-10 mg/kg, IP) significantly attenuated the psychological stress-induced increase in TBARS content in the brain. The aglycone of MR2 (MR2-aglycone: 1.2 mg/kg, IP), at the equivalent dose of MR2 (i.e., 3 mg/kg, IP), also produced the suppressive effect on the increase in the TBARS content. The in vivo suppressive effect of MR2 was dose dependently attenuated by flumazenil (3 and 10 mg/kg, IP), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and pregnenolone sulfate (10 mg/kg, IP), a neurosteroidal negative allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors. These findings suggest that VG saponin and its major component MR2 have preventive effects on the psychological stress-induced brain cell membrane damage, and that the effect of MR2 is partly due to enhancement of GABA(A)-ergic systems in the brain.", 
    "10": "The effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist buspirone, a nonselective (diazepam), and a selective (zolpidem) GABA(A) receptor agonist were compared in the open field test of neophobia. Unhabituated rats were pretreated with the drugs once, prior to a first exposure to the open field, and their behavior was recorded both during this test and during a second trial 24 h later. It has been hypothesized that the decrease in exploratory activity observed during the second test session may be considered an adaptive reaction to the first day aversive experience (neophobia). If so, a selective modulation of 5-HT and GABA systems activity during the test could bring about significant changes in animal behavior on the retest. Buspirone at the lowest dose of 0.3 mg/kg revealed anxiolytic-like properties on the first day, whereas the action of diazepam and zolpidem was modulated by the dose-related sedative effect. At the dose of 2.4 mg/kg buspirone elicited delayed in time anxiolytic-like action, i.e., produced the antithigmotactic effect during the retrial 24 h later. Diazepam and zolpidem failed to exhibit similar profile of action. Autoradiography of [3H]muscimol binding after pretreatment of rats with buspirone showed a significant increase in the selective radioligand binding within the frontal cortex and a similar, near-significant tendency in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The behavioral data validate buspirone as important drug for the treatment of anxiety disorders, devoid of disruptive influence on motor and cognitive processes. The open field test, as modified by us, appeared sensitive in distinguishing the behavioral profiles of action of different anxiolytic compounds, including 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist. The present results support the assumption that reduced turnover of 5-HT due to stimulation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, may bring about changes in GABA(A) receptor system activity, in some brain structures, leading to the anxiolytic effect.", 
    "11": "This study examined the effect of chronic exposure to ethanol on gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated responses of layer II pyramidal neurons of the piriform cortex. Slices containing the piriform cortex were derived from pair-fed adult rats maintained on ethanol-supplemented or control liquid diet for 30 days. Responses of identified layer II pyramidal neurons to exogenously applied GABA were monitored by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Chronic exposure to ethanol resulted in a rightward shift in the EC(50) of GABA and a decrease in the amplitude of maximal GABA response. GABA-induced responses were modulated by acutely applied ethanol (10-100 mM) in both chronic ethanol-treated and control groups. No significant difference was found in the average change in GABA response, suggesting that tolerance to acute ethanol exposure did not develop. When the modulatory responses of individual cells were classified and grouped as either being attenuating, potentiating, or having no effect, the incidence of potentiation in the ethanol-treated group was significantly higher. Consistent with the absence of tolerance to acute ethanol, cross-tolerance to diazepam was not observed following 30 days of treatment with ethanol. These results are discussed in light of regionally specific effects of chronic ethanol treatment on GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses of layer II piriform cortical neurons.", 
    "12": "The present study was designed to monitor the use of atypical antipsychotics in adults with intellectual disability and to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of these drugs. Twenty-one patients were commenced on an atypical antipsychotic: 12 on Olanzapine and nine on Risperidone. The ICD-10 diagnoses of the subjects were mild (13 cases) or moderate (8 cases) mental retardation, and psychiatric disorders (17 cases) with significant impairment of behaviour in 10 cases. Tolerability was good for 15 patients experiencing minimum or no side-effects, and medication was only stopped as a result of side-effects in one case. Clinical global outcome was rated as minimally improved or better for 16 cases. The present findings suggest that the atypical antipsychotics Olanzapine and Risperidone are well tolerated by patients with intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders, and are broadly effective against target symptoms.",

Information collected included an extensive survey of medication use, medical history, and assessments of physical and mental function, quality of life, and sleep.", 
    "15": "The prevalence of insomnia (DIMS) was 32.6%, a rate similar to that reported in predominantly Caucasian populations. Depression, benzodiazepine use, and several chronic health problems were the most important factors associated with DIMS. In contrast, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) had a prevalence of 8.9%, a rate lower than that found in elderly Caucasian populations but close to that reported among native Japanese. Important factors related to EDS were symptoms of nocturnal respiratory disturbance, depression, perception of adverse quality of life, Parkinson's disease, and digitalis use.",

    "17": "Cytochrome P450 3A subfamily members (CYP3A) are the most abundant liver cytochrome P450 forms, responsible for the biotransformation of over 50% of all drugs. The expression and activity of isoforms CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 show wide inter-individual variation, influencing both drug response and disease susceptibility. The molecular basis for this variation has never been defined. In this study, we used midazolam to characterize CYP3A5 phenotype in a panel of liver samples. A clear bimodality in metabolism was observed. Analysis of the 5' flanking region of the CYP3A5 gene identified two linked polymorphisms, T-369G and A-45G, located in transcriptional regulatory elements which are associated with increased expression and activity of the gene. A polymerase chain reaction based detection assay is described facilitating future studies into both the metabolic consequences of this variation and disease association studies relating to CYP3A5.", 
    "18": "Because 36% of intentional injury victims are drug dependent, the association between drug abuse and violence, especially in urban settings, is high. Withdrawal syndromes in ICU patients confuse their clinical management, may be extremely difficult to diagnose, are often lethal, need to be suspected, and should be prophylaxed against; therefore, all ICU patients should be considered to be at high risk for drug or alcohol dependence, should be tested for evidence of such drugs, and should be interviewed (together with their family members) for the presence of drug dependence traits. Appropriate patients should be referred for formal evaluation and treatment. Withdrawal syndromes must be promptly recognized, differentiated from traumatic or metabolic deterioration, and immediately treated. As patients are unique, so is their drug dependence. Individualized withdrawal therapy, not a \"one method fits all\" approach, works best. The mainstay of most withdrawal therapy is supportive care and benzodiazepine therapy. Also, considering the high rate of multiple intoxicants present in trauma patients, withdrawal can occur from multiple agents in a single patient, further compounding these difficulties. Withdrawal from unusual substances, such as GHB, or from therapeutic interventions (e.g., prolonged opioid or benzodiazepine administration) also must be considered.",

    "20": "We performed a retrospective chart review of all cases of idiopathic generalized epilepsies treated by the authors between 1985 and 1994. We compared seizure frequency and mean intravenous benzodiazepine dose required to control absence status epilepticus, intraindividually in subjects on carbamazepine or phenytoin before and after discontinuation of these compounds, and interindividually to subjects without treatment or receiving other drugs.", 
    "21": "Bouts of absence or tonic-clonic status epilepticus and seizures in subjects treated with phenytoin or carbamazepine at therapeutic concentrations were considerably more frequent and proved intractable to treatment with valproic acid or benzodiazepines, compared with a cohort of subjects also with idiopathic generalized epilepsies, but naive to, or receiving subtherapeutic or therapeutic doses of other agents.", 
    "22": "Our observations strongly suggest that therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin and carbamazepine exacerbate idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Subjects in whom absence is one of the seizure types seem at a particularly high risk for responding paradoxically. These findings underscore the value of accurate classification of seizures and particularly the syndromic approach to diagnosis and point to the potential for iatrogenic complications with indiscriminate use of antiseizure drugs.",

All patients were adequately sedated with sevoflurane, and no intravenous access was required. Time (in minutes) to awakening (midazolam-fentanyl-ketamine 47.15, propofol 36.12, sevoflurane 5.70), discharge (midazolam-fentanyl-ketamine 141.99, propofol 91.20, sevoflurane 53.34), and total time, including induction and procedure (midazolam-fentanyl-ketamine 163.97, propofol 119.40, sevoflurane 73.93), were significantly lower for sevoflurane (P < 0.01). The complication rate for sevoflurane (4.5%) was lower (P < 0.05) than for midazolam-fentanyl-ketamine (13.4%) and for propofol (17.5%). Charges for room use and medications were also lower for sevoflurane (P < 0.01). The total charges for sedation (U.S.$) were comparable for sevoflurane (688.10) and propofol (723.08) but were higher for midazolam-fentanyl-ketamine (855.10, P < 0.01).",

    "32": "Zolpidem (ZOL) and zopiclone (ZPC) are non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, with unique effects on sleep architecture compared with conventional benzodiazepines. The two compounds have different profiles in action to two major subtypes of the GABA-A receptors, therefore different effects on sleep structure may be expected. In the present study, the effects of ZOL (10mg) and ZPC (7.5mg) were compared in nine healthy young male subjects during nine-night sessions, employing a crossover design. Time courses during the sessions were significantly different between the compounds in the ratio (%) of S2 and S1. Compared to the baseline, an increase of S2 and a decrease of S1 and SR were caused by ZPC, not by ZOL. SWS was increased by both ZPC and ZOL. Significant changes by ZOL were found during the first 150-min, while changes by ZPC were mostly observed during the second 150-min. This might be related to their half-lives. ZOL did not affect sleep latency in the morning, while ZPC caused a significant decrease. Subjective sleepiness, however, was not increased in the ZPC or ZOL mornings. It was speculated that difference in the action to the GABA-A receptor subtypes might be related to the differences in the effects on the sleep architecture between the compounds.", 
    "33": "Bispectral index (BIS) was assessed as a monitor of depth of anaesthesia during fentanyl and midazolam anaesthesia for coronary bypass surgery. In 10 patients given morphine premedication, anaesthesia was induced with a combination of midazolam and fentanyl and thereafter maintained with a continuous infusion of a mixture of midazolam and fentanyl 5 and 50 micrograms kg-1 h-1, respectively. BIS was recorded continuously but not shown to the attending anaesthetist. Plasma concentrations of midazolam and fentanyl were measured five times during the procedure. An auditory stimulus was given during bypass. All patients were interviewed twice after operation for explicit and implicit recall. No patient had any anaesthetic complications. BIS decreased during anaesthesia, but varied considerably during surgery (range 36-91) with eight patients having values > 60. Midazolam and fentanyl drug concentrations did not correlate with BIS. No patient reported explicit or implicit recall. During clinically adequate anaesthesia with midazolam and fentanyl BIS varies considerably. The most likely reason is that BIS is not an accurate measure of the depth of anaesthesia when using this combination of agents.", 
    "34": "Quality assurance data were collected prospectively for children who were sedated (n = 922) or given general anaesthesia (n = 140) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT). The data included patient characteristics, concurrent medication, adequacy of sedation, adverse events and requirement for escalated care. The quality of scans was evaluated. Reasons for preselection of general anaesthesia included previously failed sedation (28%), potential for failed sedation (32%) and perceived medical risk (14%). Hypoxaemia occurred in 2.9% of sedated children, and was more common in children classified as ASA III or IV. Sedation was inadequate for 16% of children and failed in 7%. Failed sedation was associated with greater age (P = 0.009), higher ASA status (P = 0.04) and use of benzodiazepines as sole sedatives (P < 0.03). More of the children who underwent general anaesthesia were ASA III or IV than sedated children, yet the procedure was successful in all the children who underwent general anaesthesia, with one incident of laryngospasm. Excessive motion was noted in 12% of scans of sedated children and 0.7% of those completed with general anaesthesia. We conclude that sedation of children for MRI and CT is associated with risks of hypoxaemia and of inadequate or failed sedation. These adverse events were more likely to occur in older children, those with a higher ASA status and those in whom benzodiazepines had been used as sole sedatives. For a preselected high-risk group of children, general anaesthesia may make MRI and CT scans more successful with minimal adverse events.",

    "36": "In this prospective study, 274 patients that included many elderly patients with multiple comorbid conditions underwent GI endoscopic procedures at our hospital. A total of 150 patients received propofol (20-120 mg) and fentanyl (0.25-1.5 mg). The control group of 124 patients was given midazolam (2-6 mg) and meperidine (25-75 mg). The dose of medication was titrated according to patient need and the duration of the procedure. A \"comfort score\" on a scale of 1-4 assessed the efficacy of the drugs based on pain or discomfort to the patient and ease of endoscopy. A \"sedation score\" was used to assess the degree of sedation on a scale of 1-5. The Aldrete score was used to measure recovery from anesthesia at 5 and 10 min after the procedure.", 
    "37": "After controlling for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status Classification (ASA grade), and type and duration of procedure, logistic regression analysis determined that propofol resulted in 2.04 times better patient comfort (p = 0.033, 95% CI = 1.058-3.923). Propofol was 1.84 times more likely to produce deeper sedation than the regimen of midazolam and meperidine (p = 0.027, 95% CI = 1.071-3.083). The recovery from sedation was faster in patients receiving propofol, although this did not reach statistical significance. The safety parameters between the two groups were comparable.",

Autoradiographic analyses revealed a heterogeneous distribution of [3H]L-655,708 binding sites in CA1-CA3 areas with high levels in stratum oriens, stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum contrasting with low levels in stratum lacunosum. The highest quantity of alpha5 receptors was found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This pattern of expression was identical in both hippocampus from control and Alzheimer's disease subjects. Quantitative studies demonstrated that the number of [3H]L-655,708 binding sites is well preserved in Alzheimer's disease with only a moderate reduction (25-30%) in the CA1 subfield and entorhinal cortex. Furthermore, saturation and competition experiments with [3H]L-655,708 and representative benzodiazepine site ligands revealed that alpha5 receptors in Alzheimer's hippocampus have an alpha5beta2/3gamma2 pharmacology and structure as in control human brain.Overall, the data reported here provide evidence for a specific expression and relative sparing of alpha5 subunit-containing gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients.", 
    "54": "Many medications can interact with alcohol, thereby altering the metabolism or effects of alcohol and/or the medication. Some of these interactions can occur even at moderate drinking levels and result in adverse health effects for the drinker. Two types of alcohol-medication interactions exist: (1) pharmacokinetic interactions, in which alcohol interferes with the metabolism of the medication, and (2) pharmacodynamic interactions, in which alcohol enhances the effects of the medication, particularly in the central nervous system (e.g., sedation). Pharmacokinetic interactions generally occur in the liver, where both alcohol and many medications are metabolized, frequently by the same enzymes. Numerous classes of prescription medications can interact with alcohol, including antibiotics, antidepressants, antihistamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, histamine H2 receptor antagonists, muscle relaxants, nonnarcotic pain medications and anti-inflammatory agents, opioids, and warfarin.

Over a period of 5 years (1991-1995), 6,055 urine samples were analyzed for opioids (morphine, codeine, buprenorphine, dextropropoxyphene, pentazocine) and benzodiazepines (diazepam, nitrazepam) by TLC. Out of all the drug tests (n = 9,922) carried out, 24% of the drugs had been used during the past 72 hr. Averaged across all drugs, the detection rates corresponding to 24, 48, and 72 hr by TLC were 37%, 36%, and 31%, respectively. A high percentage of negative TLC results was observed in these samples. Moderate sensitivity of the TLC assay procedure, low consumption of drug, short time between drug use and urine collection, overreporting by the subjects, and drug use history of the subject obtained from multiple sources led to high negative results. These findings suggest that all the TLC negative results also need further confirmation by an alternative, more sensitive technique in a clinical setting.

Our goal was to identify polymorphisms in the human GABA(A)alpha6 receptor gene and determine whether a variant of the receptor is associated with alcoholism. The GABA(A)alpha6 receptor gene coding region was screened in 80 unrelated patients with alcoholism using single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. For rapid genotyping, a Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was developed. A relatively abundant amino acid substitution and three synonymous DNA substitutions were detected. The synonymous variants, 35A>G, 665A>G, and 1031G>C had rare-allele frequencies of 0.25, 0.02, and 0.47, respectively.

Pro385Ser has rarer allele frequencies of 3.3% and 4.8% in 196 Finnish alcoholic patients and 189 controls, respectively (P = NS). A naturally occurring non-conservative Pro385Ser was detected in the GABA(A)alpha6 receptor. The variant is not associated with alcoholism.", 
    "66": "The mechanisms of H(2)O(2)-induced elevated calcium baselines in PC12 cells were investigated in the present study by using fura-2-fluorescent image analysis. The results showed that the calcium comes from both intracellular and extracellular sources. Although the major intracellular source was mitochondria, only the extracellular calcium influx was responsible for the sustained post-H(2)O(2)-exposure increases. This calcium influx was partially blocked by calcium channel antagonists [verapamil (L-type) or mibefradil (nonselective)] and was more effectively blocked by the sodium channel antagonist, tetrodotoxin (TTX). Membrane depolarization following H(2)O(2) exposure contributed to the opening of the ion channels. The H(2)O(2)-induced calcium influx was blocked by TTX even in a sodium-free buffer, indicating that calcium directly fluxed through sodium channels. Sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX) on the plasma membrane did not play a role, because use of a specific reverse mode NCX inhibitor, No. 7943, was ineffective in blocking the influx. The H(2)O(2)-induced calcium influx was mimicked by using a thiol-selective oxidizing reagent, 2', 2'-dithiodipyridine, and in both situations, the calcium levels were completely reversed by a thiol-selective reducing reagent, dithiothreitol. Our results indicated that mechanisms of oxidant-induced elevated calcium baselines in PC12 cells involved calcium influx through sodium and calcium channels that may be directly or indirectly attributed to thiol oxidation.",

    "68": "The quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of serum albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein was monitored by spectrofluorimetry and the data were used to calculate the apparent dissociation constant. Sodium warfarin was used to probe the warfarin-binding site of serum albumin and diazepam was used to probe the benzodiazepine binding site. Additionally, the binding of sodium salicylate, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, iophenoxic acid, theophylline, chloramphenicol, acetaminophen, lithium chloride and ampicillin were also investigated. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride and imipramine hydrochloride were used as probes for alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The assays were also extended to the multiwell format. The quenching curves were fitted to the quadratic binding equation to determine the dissociation constants.", 
    "69": "Intrinsic fluorescence measurements are an excellent predictor of the drug binding to human serum albumin and to alpha1-acid glycoprotein. These measurements detect binding to the warfarin and benzodiazepine binding sites of human serum albumin. The dissociation constants estimated using the method compare favorably to the dissociation constants previously reported by Epps et al. using extrinsic fluorescence methodology, and the results correlate well with equilibrium dialysis using drug displacement endpoints.", 
    "70": "These measurements can be carried out with small samples and do not require separation of the bound and unbound species. Additionally, the proposed methods eliminate membrane separations, are not compound specific and do not require analytical chromatography or mass spectrometry for quantitation.

    "71": "Ethanol has a broad range of actions on many neurotransmitter systems. The depressant actions of ethanol in the brain are related in part to facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission via its interaction with the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ethanol on regional brain metabolism in 10 healthy right-handed men. The results were compared with those we previously published in a different group of 16 normal male subjects who received intravenous lorazepam, a benzodiazepine drug that also enhances GABA neurotransmission.", 
    "72": "The subjects were scanned with positron emission tomography and [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose twice: 40 min after the end of placebo (diet soda) or ethanol (0.75 g/kg) oral administration. Image data sets were analyzed by using both the region of interest and the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) approach. SPM was used to generate a difference image between baseline and ethanol, which we compared to the difference image between baseline and lorazepam (30 microg/kg).", 
    "73": "Ethanol significantly increased self-reports of \"high\" (p < or = 0.0001), dizziness (p < or = 0.004), and intoxication (p < or = 0.0001). Ethanol significantly decreased whole brain (-25 +/- 6%, p < or = 0.0001) and regional metabolism. Normalization of the regional measures by whole brain metabolism (relative measures) showed that ethanol decreased relative metabolic activity in occipital cortex (-4.9 +/- 4.1%, p < or = 0.006), whereas it increased relative metabolic act in left temporal cortex (+3.5 +/- 2.9%, p < or = 0.006) and left basal ganglia (+9 +/- 6.3%, p < or = 0.0009). SPM analyses revealed the same pattern of responses as the relative measures, showing decreases in occipital cortex and increases in left temporal cortex. Comparison of the relative measures and the SPM analyses obtained with lorazepam data revealed a similar pattern of effects, with relative decreases in occipital cortex (-7.8 +/- 4.8%) and relative increases in left temporal cortex (+3.8 +/- 5.7%). Lorazepam, but not ethanol, also decreased thalamic metabolism (-11.2 +/- 7.2%).", 
    "74": "These results support similar though not identical mechanisms for the effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines on brain glucose metabolism. The fact that lorazepam, but not alcohol, reduced thalamic metabolism, an effect associated with sleepiness, could explain the higher sedative effects of lorazepam than of alcohol.", 
    "75": "The anxiolytics withdrawal constitutes a frequently desirable therapeutic situation in which it is necessary to integrate clinical data related to the disorder for which they were prescribed as well as the pharmacological and psychological aspects. Personality features and emotional environment of the patient are to be considered. This withdrawal follows a first step in which the anxiolytics were initially prescribed. This situation happens in medicine in multiple clinical situations. However, because of the phenomena of tolerance and dependence but also according to the efficacy of the anti-depressants in most anxiety disorders, benzodiazepines are described in France as over-prescribed molecules. General rules of prescription are a prelude to a good withdrawal process. This last must always be prevented especially when the dosage is high occurring after a long duration treatment. A good guideline for the initial prescription is a good ticket to anticipate the withdrawal time.", 
    "76": "The amnesiac effects of benzodiazepines were used soon after their introduction by anaesthetists for premedication. The aim was to crase any unpleasant memories of surgical intervention or its preparation. Unfortunately, these amnesiac effects are particularly undesirable in everyday living when the subject has to use his memory. The widespread usage of benzodiazepine anxiolytics for neurotic patients or depressives treated as out-patients, or treating sleeping problems, has led to a real problem of public health. Therefore, it is important to carry out trials with a strict methodology to understand the cognitive effects of these drugs, based on the application of the concepts and methods of the cognitive sciences (a field of rapid development in recent years). Whereas the amnesiac effects of benzodiazepines were ignored by physicians for years, their consequences are possibly overestimated at present, sometimes leading to a caricatural attitude in the usage of these products.",

Pathological anxiety threshold can be understood in a dimensional perspective or by large in philosophical considerations. Therapeutic guidelines can be defined on the length of disease or by a categorical and nosological approach. Actually, this one appear more efficient. Therapeutic choice is under other conditions such as length of prescription, severity of the disorder, comorbidity and individual features of the patient. These difficulties in anxiety disorders chemotherapy lead to reconsider properly the place of psychotherapy.", 
    "78": "Febrile convulsions are the main etiology of the occasional convulsions. They occur between 6 months and 5 years. They are short, bilateral, clonic or tonico-clonic. Febrile convulsions are classified in 2 groups: benign febrile convulsions and complicated febrile convulsions. When it exists, the genetic predisposition is a significant factor recurrent of febrile convulsions, but their prognosis remains good. Treatment depends on the diagnosis of simple or complicated febrile convulsions. The treatment of febrile convulsions is intra-rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). The risks of recurrence of convulsions are inversely proportional to the intensity and duration of the fever episode before the convulsion.", 
    "79": "We investigated the role of desensitization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors on the neurotoxicity and on the [Ca2+]i changes induced by kainate or by AMPA in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The neuronal viability was evaluated either by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, or by analysis of cell morphology. Short-term exposure of the neurons to kainate or AMPA (30 min) was not toxic, but the exposure for 24 h to the excitotoxic drugs caused a concentration-dependent neurotoxic effect which was prevented by LY 303070, a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist. In the presence of cyclothiazide (CTZ), kainate or AMPA was toxic (30 min exposure), or the toxic effect was significantly enhanced (24 h exposure), but in this case LY 303070 did not completely protect the cells against kainate-induced toxicity. The alterations in the [Ca2+]i caused by kainate or AMPA showed a great cell-to-cell variability. LY 303070 completely or partially inhibited the responses stimulated by kainate. CTZ differentially affected the responses evoked by kainate or AMPA. In the majority of hippocampal neurons, CTZ did not potentiate, or only slightly potentiated, the kainate-stimulated responses but in 11% of neurons there was a great potentiation. In AMPA-stimulated neurons, the responses were slightly or greatly potentiated in the majority of neurons, but not in all of them. The results show that AMPA and kainate may be toxic, depending on the time of exposure and on the blockade of the desensitization of the AMPA receptors. Overall, our results clearly show that there exist different populations of hippocampal neurons with different sensitivities to kainate, AMPA, CTZ and LY 303070. Moreover, the effects of CTZ on both [Ca2+]i alterations and neurotoxicity are not fully correlated.", 
    "80": "While clozapine has been demonstrated to be efficacious in refractory schizophrenia and possibly schizoaffective as well as bipolar disorders, a substantial number of patients still remain unresponsive. One strategy in treating these refractory patients is to augment clozapine with other somatic treatments. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of the combination of clozapine with other somatic treatments. A total of 70 articles were obtained from a manual, as well as computerized (Medline), search of the English language literature from 1978 to March 1998. Few controlled studies exist; most were case reports/series. From these data, the greatest risk of adverse effects seems to be associated with clozapine combined with benzodiazepines, valproate, or lithium, but no currently evaluated combination is absolutely unsafe. In terms of efficacy, the data suggest a number of potential augmentation strategies, although controlled data are few. Combination therapies with clozapine are common in clinical practice, despite a lack of empirical data, and the benefits and risks of these combinations need to be systematically reviewed.",

Despite of the patient's preoperative poor cardiac function and difficulties in weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, he could recover with the aid of left ventricular bypass for 6 days without complications such as thromboembolism. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was useful in observation of thrombus, decision making in the adaptation and type-selection of mechanical ventricular support, and evaluation of its efficacy.",

This is the first case of heart transplantation from a patient with brain death, since the organ transplantation law had become valid in Japan. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl and diazepam. Aseptic technique was used in inserting and securing all catheters. The patient was assisted by left ventricular assist system, and hemodynamic suppression at anesthetic induction was trivial. Since complete AV block was present at the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), VVI pacing and infusion of isoproterenol were started. In addition, nitroglycerin was given for pulmonary vasodilation. The cardiovascular support used for weaning from CPB included dobutamine, isoprote-renol, dopamine and milrinone. Following weaning from CPB sinus rhythm appeared spontaneously and function of the transplanted heart was satisfactory. When the patient was transported to ICU reduction in doses of catecholamines was possible, and dopamine and milrinone were infused. The patient was extubated 10 hours after admission to ICU.", 
    "83": "Olanzapine is a new atypical antipsychotic (Weaver, 1997). Both early development and clinical studies support its safe use. Clinical trials suggest that it is efficacious in treating positive symptoms in schizophrenia, and more efficacious for negative symptoms and depressive symptoms than traditional antipsychotics. In addition, the side-effect profile of olanzapine is favourable, with a low incidence of EPS and little increase in prolactin during acute-phase trials. At present, olanzapine appears broadly as good as the other novel atypical drugs. As a group, the atypical antipsychotics have been recommended for use as first-line therapy, in acute schizophrenic relapse, and for those who are responsive, but intolerant, to classical antipsychotic medication (Kerwin, 1994; Lieberman, 1996). The role of olanzapine in treating treatment-resistant patients is unproven, and data is awaited comparing olanzapine directly with clozapine. The current era of development of drugs for schizophrenia holds great promise, and it is the duty of all doctors to make patients aware of the benefits and risks of available treatments, and to enable them to choose.", 
    "84": "This paper presents a new model suitable to describe the drug release from drug delivery systems constituted by an ensemble of drug loaded crosslinked polymer particles. The model accounts for the main factors affecting the drug release such as the particle size distribution, the physical state and the concentration profile of the drug inside the polymeric particles, the viscoelastic properties of the polymer-penetrant system and the dissolution-diffusion properties of the loaded drug. In order to check the validity of the model, release experiments were performed by using crosslinked polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP) particles and two different model drugs, MAP (medroxyprogesterone acetate) and TEM (Temazepam). MAP and TEM were chosen because of their completely different dissolution behaviours in water. In particular, TEM undergoes a phase transition to the crystalline state upon dissolution when it is loaded in the polymeric network in the amorphous state. The comparison with the experimental results confirms that the most important factors determining the drug release kinetics can be properly accounted for.", 
    "85": "In this paper we examined the effect of flumazenil (Ro 15-1788, 10 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, on the anticonflict activity of DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (CGP 37849), a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, and 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACPC), a partial agonist at glycine(B) receptors, in the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats. The effect of flumazenil on the anxiolytic-like (in the plus-maze test) and the anticonvulsant (in the maximal electroshock-induced seizures) activities of CGP 37849 in rats was also studied. Diazepam was used as a reference drug. CGP 37849 (2. 5-5 mg/kg), ACPC (50-200 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5-5 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently increased the number of shocks accepted during experimental sessions in the conflict drinking test. Flumazenil partly but significantly reduced the anticonflict effect of CGP 37849, and it fully blocked the anticonflict effect of ACPC and diazepam. CGP 37849 (2.5-5 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5-5 mg/kg) were also active in the plus-maze test, as they significantly increased the percentage of the time spent in and entries into the open arms of the plus-maze, both those effects having been antagonized by flumazenil. Flumazenil alone was inactive in both the conflict drinking and the plus-maze tests. In the maximal electroshock-induced seizures, both CGP 37849 (2.5-5 mg/kg) and diazepam (5-10 mg/kg) produced anticonvulsant effects, of which only that of diazepam was antagonized by flumazenil. The results of the present study showing antagonism of flumazenil towards the anxiolytic-like effects of CGP 37849 and ACPC suggest involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in such an activity of the NMDA and glycine(B) receptor ligands, respectively, which may be due to a possible interaction between NMDA and GABA/benzodiazepine systems. The lack of effect of the benzodiazepine antagonist on the anticonvulsant activity of CGP 37849 indicates that involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in the pharmacological action of the NMDA antagonist is not a general phenomenon.", 
    "86": "Compounds varying in selectivity as 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists have recently been reported to produce benzodiazepine-like antianxiety effects in mice. To assess the cross-species generality of these findings, the present experiments compared the effects of diazepam (0.625-5 mg/kg) with those of several non-selective (MM-77, 0.03-1 mg/kg and pindobind-5-HT(1A), 0.1-5 mg/kg) and selective (WAY100635, 0.01-10 mg/kg, p-MPPI, 0.01-3 mg/kg and SL88.0338, 0.3-10 mg/kg) 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists in three well-validated anxiolytic screening tests in rats: punished lever-pressing, punished drinking, and the elevated plus-maze. In the punished lever-pressing conflict test, none of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists modified rates of punished responding, whereas in the punished drinking test, WAY100635 (0.3-1 mg/kg), SL88.0338 (3-10 mg/kg), p-MPPI (1 mg/kg), MM-77 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), but not pindobind-5-HT(1A), produced clear anticonflict activity. However, the increase in punished responding with the 5-HT(1A) compounds was smaller than that produced by diazepam, indicating weaker anxiolytic-like activity. In the elevated plus-maze test, WAY100635 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg), SL88.0338 (0.3-10 mg/kg), MM-77 (0.01-3 mg/kg), pindobind-5-HT(1A) (0.1-3 mg/kg), but not p-MPPI, showed anxiolytic-like activity on traditional behavioral indices, increasing the percentage of time spent in open arms and the percentage of open arm entries. As was the case in the punished drinking test, the magnitude of the positive effects of the 5-HT(1A) compounds was generally smaller than that of diazepam. Of the ethological measures recorded in the plus-maze, all compounds markedly decreased risk assessment (i.e. attempts) over the entire dose-range, but only diazepam clearly increased directed exploration (i.e. head-dipping). Although the present results demonstrate that 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists elicit anxiolytic-like effects in rats, this action appears to be test-specific and, unlike previous findings in mice, smaller than that observed with benzodiazepines. The data are discussed in relation to the possible relevance of species differences in 5-HT(1A) receptor function and the nature of the anxiety response studied.", 
    "87": "Morphine-dependent rats were allowed to undergo withdrawal by abrupt discontinuation of the drug. The regional expression of brain M1 muscarinic receptors was measured directly by autoradiographic determination with [(3)H] pirenzepine, and indirectly by quantifying the relative levels of M1 mRNA encoding the receptor protein. Patterns of receptor changes after morphine treatment were in general agreement using the two methods. Frontal cortical samples derived from morphine-dependent rats exhibited a 28% increase in M1 receptor mRNA measured at the end of the infusion. At the peak of the withdrawal, M1 mRNA levels for dependent rats were much lower (33.4%) than those for control rats. Hippocampal samples derived from morphine-dependent rats exhibited no changes in M1 mRNA levels after the morphine infusion. During the peak of withdrawal, however, hippocampal M1 mRNA levels were reduced (57%) compared with levels for controls. The M1 mRNA levels remained at this reduced degree of expression even after withdrawal symptoms had subsided. Addition of diisopropylflurophophate (DFP) to the morphine infusion schedule inhibited the adaptive changes in M1 mRNA levels induced by morphine. During the peak period of withdrawal, M1 mRNA levels in the hippocampus declined by only 18% as compared with 57% for the morphine control group. The adaptive decrease in hippocampal M1 receptors after withdrawal subsided may reflect prolonged heightened cholinergic activity in an area where such cholinergic innervation plays an important role in memory.", 
    "88": "This study was designed to investigate whether anticholinergic drugs acting at the level of the substantia nigra can affect basal extracellular dopamine concentrations and the levodopa (L-dopa)-induced increases in dopamine levels in the striatum. Dual probe in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats was used. One microdialysis probe was implanted in the substantia nigra and the other in the ipsilateral striatum. Muscarinic receptor antagonists were perfused into the substantia nigra and changes in neurotransmitter levels in the substantia nigra and at the axon terminals in the striatum were monitored simultaneously. Nigral perfusion of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist trihexyphenidyl (1 mM) produced an increase in extracellular dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the substantia nigra. Perfusion with the muscarinic M(1) receptor antagonist telenzepine (0.1 microM) produced a significant decrease in nigral dopamine and GABA levels in the substantia nigra. The muscarinic M(2) receptor antagonist methoctramine (75 microM) produced an increase in dopamine levels in the substantia nigra. No significant changes in nigral extracellular GABA levels were observed. The L-dopa-induced increases in extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum were clearly attenuated under nigral perfusion of these drugs. This in vivo study demonstrates that anticholinergic drugs perfused at the level of the substantia nigra can modulate dopamine and GABA levels and attenuate the L-dopa decarboxylation in the striatum, possibly via modulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. We add further evidence that the substantia nigra is an important site of action of antimuscarinic drugs. The attenuation of L-dopa-induced dopamine release in the striatum exerted by nigral perfusion of these antimuscarinic drugs is probably mediated via different mechanisms. This attenuation is regarded as a beneficial effect of the muscarinic antagonists as adjuncts to L-dopa in Parkinson's disease treatment. We postulate that drugs that enhance dopamine release, after L-dopa administration, in a less extreme way than L-dopa administered on its own could prevent further neurodegeneration and dyskinesias thought to result from extremely high extracellular dopamine levels following L-dopa treatment.", 
    "89": "Clozapine reduces L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa)-induced dyskinesias in parkinsonian patients. To test if the antidyskinetic effect of clozapine is related to antagonism at the dopamine D(4) receptor, we investigated the effect of 8-methyl-6-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-11H-pyrido[2,3-b][1, 4]benzodiazepine (JL-18), a structural analog of clozapine which is more selective for this receptor. Four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated cynomolgus monkeys with a stable parkinsonian syndrome and reproducible dyskinesias to L-Dopa were used in this study. They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-Dopa methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-Dopa/benserazide) alone or in combination with JL-18 (at the doses of 0.1, 0.3, or 0.9 mg/kg, s.c.). Subcutaneous injection of sterile saline was used as control. L-Dopa/benserazide increased locomotion and improved parkinsonism but also induced dyskinesias. Co-administration of JL-18, at low doses (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg) with L-Dopa/benserazide, produced a dose-dependent reduction in L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias without a parallel return to parkinsonism. The present results suggest that novel selective dopamine D(4) receptor antagonists may represent a useful tool to reduce L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias.",

Eleven nonsmoking, healthy, eumenorrheic women were enrolled in this study. Triazolam (0.25 mg) was administered orally, and indocyanine green was administered as an i.v. bolus (0.5 mg/kg) during the follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases of a single menstrual cycle. Blood samples were collected over 10 hours for triazolam and over 30 minutes for ICG. Triazolam and indocyanine green concentrations were quantitated by electron capture gas chromatography and spectrophotometry, respectively. Noncompartmental analysis was used to determine relevant pharmacokinetics parameters, which were statistically assessed using two-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). No statistical differences for triazolam were observed. Vd/F was lower in the luteal phase (107 L) as compared to the follicular (138 L) and ovulatory (133 L) phases. Clearance of triazolam was comparable in the follicular (583 ml/min), ovulatory (565 ml/min), and luteal (538 ml/min) phases. ICG also revealed no significant differences across the phases.

Prevalence of benzodiazepine use in the last 15 days was 21.3% (CI 95% 18.1-24.5), and prevalence of daily use for 12 or more months was 7.4% (CI 95% 5.4-9.4). In a multivaried analysis the amount of drugs being consumed displayed an important and progressive association with long-term benzodiazepine use, with OR = 2.77 (CI 95% 1.17-6.57) for those who take from four to six drugs, and OR = 7.62 (CI 95% 3.18-18.26) for those who take more than seven drugs. Insomnia (OR = 8.87 CI 95% 2.53-31.06) and chronic headache (OR = 3.53 CI 95% 1.82-6.89) have also been associated with this pattern of use.",

    "108": "Numerous reports in both humans and animals have confirmed that benzodiazepines produce amnesia; however, mechanisms mediating this effect are not clear. In view of the important role of brain somatostatin (SRIF) in the cognitive function of rats, this study sought to determine if the benzodiazepine, diazepam, alters somatostatinergic system in the rat frontoparietal cortex. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg/day) to male Wistar rats (200-250 g) for 3 or 7 days decreased the number of SRIF receptors (26 and 37%, respectively) in synaptosomes from the frontoparietal cortex, without influencing their apparent affinity. This decrease in the tracer binding was not attributable to a direct effect of diazepam on SRIF receptors, because no decrease of SRIF binding was induced by a large concentration of diazepam (10(-4) M) when the drug was added to a preparation of synaptosomes from frontoparietal cortex of untreated rats. To determine if the effect of diazepam on SRIF binding is related to the binding of diazepam to its recognition site on the GABA(A) receptor, a benzodiazepine antagonist, 2-phenylpyrazolo[3,4-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 8216) was administered before the diazepam injection. Pretreatment with CGS 8216 (20 mg/kg/day, i.p.) blocked completely the diazepam-induced decrease in the number of SRIF receptors. CGS 8216 alone had no observable effect. The decrease in the number of 125I-Tyr11-SRIF receptor induced by diazepam was accompanied by a decrease in the effect of SRIF, after 15 seconds of stimulation, on inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) mass accumulation in the rat frontoparietal cortex at 3 (64%) or 7 days (59%) after its administration. Diazepam alone had no observable effect on mass accumulation of IP3. After 14 days of daily diazepam injections, the levels of binding of 125I-Tyr11-SRIF in the frontoparietal cortex returned to control values, coinciding with the tolerance that develops to this benzodiazepine agonists when administered chronically. The decrease in IP3 levels was still observed after 14 days (57%) diazepam administration. Diazepam and CGS 8216 did not affect SRIF-like immunoreactivity levels in the frontoparietal cortex at the three time intervals studied (3, 7 or 14 days). The alteration of frontoparietal cortex SRIF receptor-effector system after 3 or 7 days of diazepam treatment suggests that somatostatinergic neurotransmission plays a role in the mechanism of diazepam action on memory.", 
    "109": "The atypical neuroleptics, clozapine and olanzapine, have superior therapeutic efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, compared with the typical neuroleptics. Recently, it has been suggested that the ability of clozapine and olanzapine to induce Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuropharmacological effects of clozapine and olanzapine in the mPFC remain elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that clozapine- and olanzapine-induced Fos expression in the mPFC are inhibited by propranolol. We also show that clozapine and olanzapine induce Fos expression in the locus coeruleus. These results suggest that clozapine and olanzapine increase noradrenaline release by stimulating noradrenergic neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus and, consequently, increased noradrenaline induce Fos expression in the mPFC via beta-adrenergic receptors. This postulated sequence may be one of mechanisms by which clozapine-like atypical neuroleptics are more effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",

LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) was devoid of any significant action upon each seizure parameter in kindled rats (seizure severity, seizure duration, after-discharge duration). LY 300164 (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant anticonvulsive effect as regards seizure and after-discharge durations. Combined treatment with LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.3125-1.25 mg/kg) resulted in the clear-cut anticonvulsive activity. It is noteworthy that the antiseizure potency of the combined treatment (diazepam 1.25 mg/kg plus LY 300164 2 mg/kg) was comparable to that of diazepam (10-20 mg/kg) alone. The combination of diazepam (1.25 mg/kg) with LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) did not induce any significant motor impairment in the rotorod test or memory deficit in the passive-avoidance task. In contrast, diazepam alone (10-20 mg/kg) had pronounced adverse effects in kindled animals. LY 300164 (up to 2 mg/kg) did not influence the threshold for electro- and pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions but potentiated the anticonvulsive action of diazepam in the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol test in mice, the ED50s of the benzodiazepine being reduced from 13 to 8.7 and from 0.29 to 0.049 mg/kg, respectively. As shown in the passive-avoidance task, combination of LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) with diazepam (8.7 mg/ kg) produced significant motor and long-term memory impairment. Diazepam alone (at the dose equal to its ED50 against maximal electroshock) also caused motor and memory deficits in mice. Interaction at the pharmacokinetic level, at least in plasma, can be excluded, because LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) did not affect the free plasma diazepam concentration. In conclusion, LY 300164 potentiates the protective action of diazepam in some animal models of seizures. This profitable interaction may create a new approach for the treatment of drug resistant epilepsy or status epilepticus.",

In addition to alcohol, the most frequently used date-rape drug, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), a fast-acting benzodiazepine, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its congeners are among the most popular drugs used for this purpose. The latter drug is easily procured at some gymnasiums, popular bars, discos, and rave clubs, as well as over the Internet. Perpetrators choose these drugs because they act rapidly, produce disinhibition and relaxation of voluntary muscles, and cause the victim to have lasting anterograde amnesia for events that occur under the influence of the drug. Alcoholic beverages potentiate the drug effects. We review several date-rape drugs, provide information on laboratory testing for them, and offer guidelines for preventing drug-facilitated sexual assault.",

In MGM-1 cells, PBR is located in the nucleus, and cells proliferate in response to PBR ligands but do not synthesize steroids de novo. In MGM-3 cells, PBR is located in mitochondria and the cells synthesize steroids, but do not proliferate in response to PBR ligands. In glioblastoma biopsies, PBR is expressed in the nuclei of cells, while it is found in the cytosol of astrocytomas, and is absent from meningioma and medulloblastoma tumor biopsies. These data suggest that the subcellular localization of PBR defines its function.",

Both muscimol (at 0.075 microg, combined bilateral dose) and morphine (1.0 microg) in the nucleus accumbens shell increased feeding as expected. However, it was clear that diazepam (2.5, 5.0, 25, 50 microg) and midazolam (7.5 microg) both failed to enhance feeding even at doses that are effective when microinjected in the brain stem. We conclude that opioid and GABA(A) agents promote feeding behavior by acting on receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell, but that benzodiazepines probably act elsewhere in the brain to increase food intake.",

An activity test was made after these treatments to control for unspecific actions due to motor impairment. Diazepam and buspirone dose-dependently inhibited the expression of maternal aggression and the active components of maternal behavior such as retrieving and nest building. 8-OH-DPAT did not affect these behaviors. 8-OH-DPAT (1.0 mg/kg) provoked the serotonergic syndrome and hypothermia; however, ovariectomized animals showed more signs of the syndrome and a decrease in body temperature after 8-OH-DPAT than lactating rats. Buspirone, but not the other anxiolytics, reduced motor activity. The role of drugs acting at the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and GABA-benzodiazepine systems in the control of maternal behavior and aggression is discussed.", 
    "121": "The gamma 2 subunit is required for benzodiazepine modulation of the GABA(A) receptor. Alternate splicing of precursor GABA(A) gamma 2 mRNA results in two splice variants, a short (gamma 2S) and a long (gamma 2L) variant. We investigated the roles of these splice variants in benzodiazepine pharmacology using mice lacking genes for the gamma 2L splice variant. Sleep time responses to midazolam and zolpidem were 20 and 18% greater, respectively, in null allele mice compared with wild-type mice, while responses to nonbenzodiazepine agents such as etomidate and pentobarbital were unchanged. Although the GABA(A) receptor number was not altered in null allele mice, there was a corresponding increase in affinity of brain membranes for benzodiazepine agonists (midazolam, diazepam, and zolpidem), while affinity for benzodiazepine inverse agonists (beta CCM and Ro15-4513) was decreased. These changes were not observed in inbred mice of the parental strains (C57BL/6J and 129/SvJ) used to create the genetically altered mice, indicating that differences between gamma 2L null allele and wild-type mice were unlikely to be simply due to cosegregation of linked alleles. Absence of the gamma 2L splice variant increases the affinity of receptors for benzodiazepine agonists, and is associated with a modest increase in behavioral sensitivity to benzodiazepine agonists. Lack of the gamma 2L subunits may shift the GABA(A) receptor from an inverse agonist-preferring toward an agonist-preferring configuration.", 
    "122": "Radiotelemetry was utilized to compare zolpidem and lorazepam tolerance and withdrawal in rats. Locomotor activity, electromyographic activity (EMG), and body temperatures were used to assess the acute drug effects, and as measures of tolerance and withdrawal. Lorazepam, zolpidem, or vehicle was administered for 12 days, and data were recorded daily, immediately, after treatment. Data were also recorded immediately after flumazenil (25 mg/kg, IP) precipitated withdrawal and during 4 days of spontaneous withdrawal. Complete tolerance to the acute effects of lorazepam administration developed within 7 days of treatment and both flumazenil-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal were observed. In contrast, there was no tolerance to the sedative actions of zolpidem administration after 12 days, but complete tolerance to the hypothermic and muscle relaxant effects was apparent after 8 days of treatment. Despite the presence of tolerance, no evidence of either spontaneous or flumazenil-induced withdrawal was recorded in these rats. In conclusion, this model suggests that as a sedative zolpidem has significant advantages over the classic benzodiazepines.", 
    "123": "Diabetes-associated depression may occur due to changes in the quality of life imposed by treatment, or may be a consequence of the biochemical changes accompanying the disease. It was our objective to evaluate the behaviors of diabetic rats through an animal model of depression, and determine if a positive GABA modulator agent, clonazepam, is an effective antidepressant. Wistar male rats were submitted to the forced-swimming test after 26 days of the induction of diabetes with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Test and retest days analyzed with an ethological approach. Clonazepam (control, 0.25, 0. 5, and 1.0 mg/kg) was administered IP 24, 5, and 1 h before the retest. Diabetic rats presented longer immobility duration during test and retest of forced swimming. Diabetic rats dived significantly less during the test. Clonazepam 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg decreased immobility of diabetic rats with no consequences on the behaviors of nondiabetic rats. These results demonstrate that diabetic rats present more intense depressive-like behavior, such as immobility and lack of interest in exploring the environment, when exposed to the forced-swimming test. It is possible that decreased GABA function is involved in depression associated with diabetes, because a benzodiazepine partially counteracts these changes without modifying blood glucose and glycogen parameters.", 
    "124": "In the present work, we studied the effects of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist, flumazenil, and of the agonist, diazepam, on social interaction-induced transient changes in defensive burying (DB). Enhanced defensive burying was observed after 1.5 min of social interaction experience, while a longer social interaction experience, 15 min, inhibited the expression of burying behavior. Defensive burying and social interaction paradigms have been used for the screening of compounds with anxiolytic potential and, more extensively, to study the neurobiology of anxiety. To elucidate the participation of the BZ receptor on transient changes induced by intervals of social interaction experience, its receptor antagonist, flumazenil (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected (IP). Flumzenil enhanced in a dose-dependent manner, the blocking effect of the saline IP injection on facilitated DB in 1.5-min social interaction-experienced subjects. In addition, flumazenil enlarged in a dose-dependent manner the blocking effect of saline IP on defensive burying levels in animals exposed to social interaction experience for 15 min. To analyze the presumed participation of the BZ receptor mediating enhanced burying behavior levels in subjects exposed to 1.5 min of social interaction, a suboptimal dose of diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) was administered. Diazepam enhanced the saline IP elicited defensive burying reduction. Results are discussed in terms of the suggested BZ receptor mediation on transient changes in defensive burying elicited by social interaction experience.", 
    "125": "Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization is a critical event in the process leading to physiologic or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (programmed cell death). This permeabilization event is, at least in part, under the control of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC). Oncoproteins from the Bcl-2 family and tumor suppressor proteins from the Bax family interact with PTPC to inhibit or facilitate membrane permeabilization, respectively. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents elicit mitochondrial permeabilization in an indirect fashion by induction of endogenous effectors that are involved in the physiologic control of apoptosis. However, an increasing number of experimental anticancer drugs, including lonidamine, arsenite, betulinic acid, CD437, and several amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptides, act directly on mitochondrial membranes and/or on the PTPC. Such agents may induce apoptosis in circumstances in which conventional drugs fail to act because endogenous apoptosis induction pathways, such as those involving p53, death receptors, or apical caspase activation, are disrupted. However, stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane by antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins reduces the cytotoxic potential of most of these drugs. Targeting of specific PTPC components may overcome this Bcl-2-mediated apoptosis inhibition. One strategy involves cross-linking of critical redox-sensitive thiol groups within the PTPC; another involves the use of ligands to the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor. Thus, the design of mitochondrion-targeted cytotoxic drugs may constitute a novel strategy for overcoming apoptosis resistance.", 
    "126": "The mode of operation of synaptic transmission has been primarily worked out at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, thus providing a framework for the interpretation of studies at central synapses. However, differences have been found between the two systems, and a coherent model is still lacking for central synapses. Research in this area revolves around several questions. (1) Is the variability of quantal amplitudes determined pre- or postsynaptically? (2) What is the occupancy of postsynaptic receptors following the release of a synaptic vesicle? And (3) does multivesicular release occur at single release sites following one presynaptic action potential? To answer these questions, it is essential to investigate synaptic processes at the level of single release sites. This is technically difficult because of the complex morphology and small dimensions of central synapses. Nevertheless significant advances have been made in the past few years.", 
    "127": "In the present experiment we studied the ability of embryonic striatal grafts to protect against striatal quinolinic acid (QA)-induced excitotoxicity in a previously established double lesion rat model of striatonigral degeneration (SND), the neuropathological substrate of parkinsonism associated with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Male Wistar rats received under halothane inhalation anesthesia a 6-hydroxydopamine 6-OHDA injection into the left medial forebrain bundle. Four to 5 weeks later apomorphine-induced rotation behavior was tested. Rats were divided into two treatment groups receiving either embryonic striatal cell suspensions or sham injections. Apomorphine-induced rotation behavior was retested 2 and 4 weeks after the grafting procedure. Following the rotation test animals of the striatal and sham graft group received a stereotaxic injection of 150 nmol QA. Again rotation behavior was assessed 2 and 4 weeks after lesioning. Brains were then processed to dopamine reuptake ([(3)H]mazindol), dopamine D1 ([(3)H]SCH23390), and D2 ([(3)H]spiperone) receptor autoradiography. Gliosis was detected using [(3)H]PK11195, a marker for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. Behavioral and autoradiographic analysis failed to show striatal protection in 6-OHDA prelesioned animals receiving embryonic striatal grafts. These findings indicate that beneficial protective effects of striatal grafts implanted into host striatum prior to excitotoxic insults are abolished in the presence of severe dopaminergic denervation. Our present results are relevant to future applications of neural grafting in MSA-SND.", 
    "128": "A computational model of the non-nucleoside inhibitor 8-Cl TIBO complexed with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) was constructed in order to determine the binding free energies. Using Monte Carlo simulations, both free energy perturbation and linear response calculations were carried out for the transformation of wild-type RT to two key mutants, Y181C and L100I. The newer linear response method estimates binding free energies based on changes in electrostatic and van der Waals energies and solvent-accessible surface areas. In addition, the change in stability of the protein between the folded and unfolded states was estimated for each of these mutations, which are known to emerge upon treatment with the inhibitor. Results from the calculations revealed that there is a large hydrophobic contribution to protein stability in the native, folded state. The calculated absolute free energies of binding from both the linear response, and also the more rigorous free energy perturbation method, gave excellent agreement with the experimental differences in activity. The success of the relatively rapid linear response method in predicting experimental activities holds promise for estimating the activity of the inhibitors not only against the wild-type RT, but also against key protein variants whose emergence undermines the efficacy of the drugs.", 
    "129": "Pharmacological characterization of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors in rat, rabbit, mouse and human salivary glands was determined by receptor binding and photoaffinity labeling analysis using [3H]PK14105 (1-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid). [3H]PK14105 bound to the membranes of salivary glands in rats, rabbits, mice and humans with high affinity at the nanomolar level. The rank order of receptor density in submandibular glands among several species was as follows: human > or = rat > or = mouse > rabbit. Competitive potency of receptor ligands against [3H]PK14105 was as follows: PK1195 > or = Ro5-4864 > diazepam > clonazepam > Ro15-1788. The rank order of potency against calcium channel ligands and co-transport inhibitors was as follows: nitrendipine > BAY K 8644 > bumetanide > furosemide. Pretreatment with nitrendipine or BAY K 8644 decreased the affinity of [3H]PK14105 binding to rat parotid gland membranes, without changing the density. The photoaffinity labeling with [3H]PK14105 indicated the presence of the 18-kDa protein in all salivary glands of our experiment. The inhibition of photolabeling by some receptor ligands was the same results as the receptor binding assay. In conclusion, the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors include the 18-kDa protein photolabeled with [3H]PK14105 in salivary glands of rat, mouse, rabbit and human.", 
    "130": "The present study investigated the hypothesis that behavioural sensitization to psychomotor stimulants is expressed only if the internal state of the animal is the same as it was at the time of sensitization development. This state-dependency hypothesis has previously been put forward to explain the apparent blockade of sensitization by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. The present study used amphetamine (0.375 mg/kg) as the stimulant and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) as a secondary stimulus. Mice were given double injections of either amphetamine + CDP, amphetamine + saline, CDP + saline, or saline + saline daily over 8 days. On the ninth and tenth days, all mice were challenged with amphetamine + saline and with CDP + saline, in a counterbalanced design. CDP does not show evidence of locomotor sensitization and does not act at NMDA receptors, but in other studies it has been shown to give rise to state-dependent-like effects. Thus any progressive augmentation of the response to repeated amphetamine + CDP treatment would be attributable to amphetamine sensitization, and any blockade of sensitization would not be due to NMDA receptor antagonism. Both groups receiving amphetamine became sensitized over the first 8 days (shown by progressive increases in locomotion). When challenged with amphetamine alone, the amphetamine + CDP group failed to show a sensitized response. This observation supports the state-dependency hypothesis and emphasizes the importance of considering the context provided by drug-induced internal states in studies of sensitization.", 
    "131": "The study examined the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist, Ro 19-8022, on anxiety-like, aggressive, social and locomotor behaviours in timid ('anxious') and aggressive mice in the social conflict test. To test the hypothesis that Ro 19-8022 acts as a partial agonist in this model, i.e. it reduces anxiety-like and aggressive behaviours without affecting motor coordination, its effects were compared to those of the full agonist, nitrazepam. Both Ro 19-8022 and nitrazepam decreased anxiety-like behaviour in timid mice and aggressive behaviour in aggressive mice. The effect of the full agonist, nitrazepam, was dose-dependent while the effect of the partial agonist, Ro 19-8022, was lower in magnitude and reflected its partial agonistic properties. Both drugs stimulated social behaviour in both groups of mice, presumably due to disinhibition of anxiety or aggression. The marked difference was in their effects on motor coordination, as nitrazepam, but not Ro 19-8022, produced motor impairment at higher doses. Thus, Ro 19-8022 produces anxiolytic-like and potent anti-aggressive effects without causing muscle relaxation or ataxia in the present model. Our data confirm that the main behavioural differences between partial and full benzodiazepine receptor agonists are in their side-effect profiles.", 
    "132": "The effects of post-injection delay time and environmental context on behaviour after subcutaneous administration of 3 mg/kg midazolam were investigated under a differential reinforcement of low rate schedule (i.e. DRL 45 s) in 3 h sessions. Post-injection delays were varied (0-120 min) for two groups of rats placed in either the experimental chamber (group 1) or home cage (group 2) during the pre-session delay times. Midazolam increased shorter-response (inter-response times < 45 s) rates and decreased reinforcement rates in a time-related manner. Reinforcement rate-time profiles were also integrated with parallel pharmacokinetics. Post-injection delays in either environment yielded performances that mirrored the pharmacokinetic profile operative at the corresponding time-delay points. At higher concentrations (> 0.12 microg/ml) the pharmacokinetics of midazolam largely determined the behavioural effects in both groups, regardless of post-injection delays. However, at lower drug concentrations, longer post-injection delays (> 60 min) in the experimental chamber produced both sensitization and tolerance, as measured by greater increases in shorter-response rates and a more rapid return of the reinforcement rate, respectively. Interaction of the discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam with the context probably alters the magnitude of behavioural effects when the delay occurs in the experimental chambers, whereas no such interaction is present in group 2. The DRL schedule with post-injection delays in experimental chambers provides a useful behavioural paradigm for studying both sensitization and tolerance.", 
    "133": "The aim of this study was to test further the hypothesis that different benzodiazepine (BZ-omega) receptor subtypes may mediate anxiolytic and amnesic effects of BZ agonists, using the selective BZ-omega1 receptor antagonist beta-CCT (beta-carboline-3-carboxylate t-butyl-ester). Experiments were performed in Swiss mice using the elevated plus-maze anxiety test and two learning tasks - passive avoidance and the radial arm maze. In the elevated plus-maze test, beta-CCT (30 mg/kg, i.p.) completely abolished the increase in open-arm entries induced by the BZ chlordiazepoxide (5mg/kg, i.p.). Chlordiazepoxide decreased retention latency in the passive avoidance step-through procedure, and increased the number of errors in the radial arm maze. These effects were not modified by beta-CCT. Except for a slight, albeit significant, amnesic effect in the passive avoidance test, beta-CCT was devoid of intrinsic activity when administered alone. These results are in agreement with previous studies using selective BZ-omega1 agonists, and thus provide further evidence that BZ-omega1 receptors may be involved in the anxiolytic but not in the amnesic effects of BZ agonists.", 
    "134": "The treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome has been improved for some patients by the introduction of adjunctive therapy with newer anticonvulsants such as lamotrigine and topiramate and the availability of vagal nerve stimulation and the re-emergence of the use of the ketogenic diet in recent years. The place of standard anticonvulsants and the role of callosotomy needs to be re-evaluated in view of the new developments. Although recommendations for the treatment of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are difficult to make in the absence of direct head-on comparative trials, the following suggested treatment recommendations are based on the best evidence available. Medical treatment should start with valproic acid (sodium valproate) and be followed by adjunctive therapy with either lamotrigine or topiramate; clobazam can be added if necessary for better seizure control while trying to reduce the dose of the other anticonvulsants. If standard treatment does not achieve sufficient seizure control or proves to be intolerable, vagal nerve stimulation, ketogenic diet, felbamate, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, and phenobarbital (phenobarbitone) are recommended as third-line choices. Further considerations include ethosuximide, methsuximide, corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or corticosteroids, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and vigabatrin. If adequate drug treatment and vagal nerve stimulation provide insufficient seizure control, partial callosotomy may be an option for the treatment of frequent, intractable and disabling drop attacks. These suggestions are based on the best evidence available and do not in any way exclude the use of other treatments if compelling individual risk-benefit considerations apply.", 
    "135": "Tonic-clonic status epilepticus (TCSE) is the most common neurological emergency and affects approximately 60000 patients each year in the US. The risk of complications increases substantially as TCSE lasts longer than 60 minutes. Ideally, drugs used to treat this condition should be well tolerated when administered as rapid intravenous infusions and should not interfere with patients' state of consciousness or cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Because of its efficacy, absence of sedation or respiratory suppression, intravenous phenytoin has largely replaced phenobarbital (phenobarbitone) as the second agent of choice (following the administration of a benzodiazepine) in the treatment of TCSE. While the efficacy of phenytoin in the treatment of acute seizures and TCSE is well established, the parenteral formulation of phenytoin has several inherent shortcomings which compromise its tolerability and limit the rate of administration. Intravenous phenytoin has been associated with fatal haemodynamic complications and serious reactions at the injection site including skin necrosis and amputation of extremities. Fosphenytoin, a phenytoin prodrug, has the same pharmacological properties as phenytoin but none of the injection site and cardiac rhythm complications of intravenous infusions of phenytoin. While fosphenytoin costs more than intravenous phenytoin, treating the acute and chronic complications of TCSE itself, and the complications of intravenous phenytoin can also be costly. All other factors being equal, there is no doubt that fosphenytoin is better tolerated and can be delivered faster than intravenous phenytoin; 2 measures that clearly improve outcome in patients with TCSE. The tolerability of intramuscular fosphenytoin also extends its use to clinical situations where prompt administration of a nondepressing anticonvulsant is indicated but secure intravenous access and cardiac monitoring are not available, such as treatment of seizures by rescue squads in the field and serial seizures in the institutionalised, elderly and other patients with intractable epilepsy.", 
    "136": "The issue of prescribing anticonvulsant drugs during lactation is clinically important, but also complex. Data for some drugs are completely lacking and for other drugs information is only available from single dose or short term studies or case reports. Moreover, limited knowledge exists about the practical impact of the drug concentrations found in breast milk and there are great methodological problems in the assessment of possible adverse drug reactions in infants. Nevertheless, based on current knowledge, some recommendations can be suggested. Treatment with carbamazepine, valproic acid (sodium valproate) and phenytoin is considered compatible with breastfeeding. Treatment with ethosuximide or phenobarbital (phenobarbitone)/primidone should most probably be regarded as potentially unsafe and close clinical monitoring of the infant is recommended if it is decided to continue breastfeeding. Occasional or short term treatment with benzodiazepines could be considered as compatible with breastfeeding, although maternal diazepam treatment has caused sedation in suckling infants after short term use. During long term use of benzodiazepines, infants should be observed for signs of sedation and poor suckling. Only very limited clinical data are available for the new generation anticonvulsant drugs and no clearcut recommendations can be made until further data are present. If it is decided to continue breast feeding during treatment with these drugs, the infant should be monitored for possible adverse effects. In general, the drug should be given in the lowest effective dose, guided by maternal serum or plasma drug concentration monitoring. If breast feeding is avoided at times of peak drug levels in milk, the exposure of the infant can be reduced to some extent. As breast milk has considerable advantages over formula milk, the benefits of continuing breast feeding should always be taken into consideration in the risk-benefit analysis.", 
    "137": "The aim of this study was to find whether endogenous substances could modulate CYP3A activity. There is evidence that CYP3A, a major phase-I xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, is present in human brain but, at the present time, endogenous substrates for such an enzyme remain to be identified. A possible linkage between the CYP2D6 enzyme and serotonergic transmission has been recently reported by our group. In the same manner, structurally related enzymes such as CYP3A could also be related to endogenous compounds.", 
    "138": "CYP3A activity was measured using the enzyme-specific substrate midazolam in human liver microsomes. Several neurotransmitters, precursors, and their metabolites, corresponding to three different metabolic routes, were assayed as putative modulators of CYP3A enzyme activity. These comprised serotonergic, catecolaminergic, and GABAergic transmitters and precursors. The inhibitory capacity of ketoconazole, a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A, was also analyzed for comparison.", 
    "139": "The kinetic analysis of the midazolam 1-hydroxylase activity measured in microsomes from five human liver samples indicated Km values (mean +/- SD) of 5.8 +/- 4.9 microM, and Vmax values of 1.7 +/- 1.4 nmol min(-1) per mg microsomal protein in all the samples used in the study. Of the 14 substances analyzed, adrenaline, serotonin, and 5-hydroxytriptofol were full inhibitors of CYP3A enzyme activity (Ki values of 42.3, 26.4, and 43 microM, respectively). The remaining substances were weak inhibitors or had no inhibitory effect.", 
    "140": "Brain CYP3A activity could be modulated by some neurotransmitters and precursors.", 
    "141": "It has been recently suggested that the central serotonin (5-HT) nervous system may be involved in the modulation of anxiety. Especially, the possible importance of 5-HT1A receptors in anxiety was raised by evidence that the anxiolytic properties of 5-HT1A-receptor agonists have now been confirmed in clinical studies. On the other hand, in preclinical studies using various animal models of anxiety, these novel agents tend to have weak and/or variable effects in some paradigms used to detect the anxiolytic activities of benzodiazepines. These differential patterns of drug effects within various models promote the concept of \"multiplicity of anxiety\". Recently, a new experimental model called the T-maze was developed in attempts to analyze a different type of anxiety; i.e., conditioned fear and unconditioned fear response. The results of a series of behavioral studies using the T-maze test suggest that distinct 5-HT pathways may modulate the different classes of anxiety. In our recent studies using the hole-board test, apparent differential behavioral effects between benzodiazepine anxiolytics and 5-HT1A agonists on emotionality of stressed mice were also observed. These results suggest that benzodiazepine or 5-HT1A receptors may play a different role in modulating emotionality. These studies may provide new information to investigate the pathophysiological characteristics of various types of anxiety disorders and to develop novel therapeutic agents.", 
    "142": "In the menopause transition, around 35% of women will seek medical help for menopausal symptoms. At the climacteric, various symptoms such as forgetfulness, anxiety, depressive neurosis, abnormal sensation, hot flush and sleeplessness are often observed due to hypofunction of the ovaries. There is some indication that women become more anxious during times of relatively low level of estrogen and progesterone such as premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, maternity blues and menopausal state. The exact mechanism behind it is still unclear but is probably related to the decrease of ovarian hormones, which may be triggering psychiatric mood disorders. It is known that ovarian hormones act on specific areas of the brain and appear to act as anxiolytics. Certain progesterone metabolites are anesthetic and have antiepileptic and anxiolytic properties. These steroids modulate the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptor. This may help explain the increased frequency of anxiety disorders and mood disorders in the early postmenopausal period. In addition, estrogen also improves memory and performance in patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia. These effects can be related to amplifying effects of estrogen on excitatory amino acids in the brain. This is suggested that gonadal steroidal hormones seemed to be one of the essential substances for the maintenance of the limbic system and forebrain function which regulated anxiety, mood, memory and cognitive functions in menopausal women.", 
    "143": "Anxiety observed in animals subjected to stress was stated in relation to anxiety level and biological backgrounds of animals, changes in neurotransmitters and causal stressors. 1. Anxiety is thought to be a negative emotion caused by many kinds of stress such as restraint stress, SART (specific alternation of rhythm in temperature) stress (a repeated cold stress caused by environmental temperature), social stress, etc. 2. Emotional behavior in those stressed animals were attenuated by anxiolytics like diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist and buspirone, a serotonin (5-HT) 1A agonist. 3. Stressed rats had changed brain levels of a variety of neurotransmitters such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), noradrenaline, 5-HT, dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine, cholecystokinin, etc. The percentage of time spent on the open arms of an elevated plus-maze apparatus decreased in those stressed animals. Abnormal elevated plus-maze behaviors were attenuated by diazepam, buspiron and a CRF antagonist. 4. Anxiety level differs according to the coping strategy of the recipients. Rats of different strain, sex, aging and/or family display different behaviors in elevated plus-maze. 5. Stress-induced anxiety-related behaviors were observed when levels of some neurotransmitters became unbalanced. Thus modulators of unbalanced brain substances are thought to have anxiolytic properties.", 
    "144": "Many animal models of anxiety have been reported; for example, Geller-type or Vogel-type anticonflict tests and ethologically based tests without punishment such as a light/dark test, a hole-board test, a social interaction test, an elevated plus-maze test and so on. These models were pharmacologically validated by the evidence that clinically useful anxiolytic benzodiazepines were active, but activities of serotonergic anxiolytics in these models were inconsistent. These models might measure a mixture of several types of anxiety. Many disorders of anxiety are classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and several disorders can not be treated with benzodiazepines very well. Animal models to evaluate the drugs for the benzodiazepine-untreatable disorders are needed. Graeff et al. performed studies to measure inhibitory avoidance latency from an enclosed arm to open arms and escape latency from the open arms to the enclosed arm as parameters of conditioned and unconditioned fears, respectively, in the elevated T-maze in rats. The latter was suggested for use in the evaluation of drugs efficacious on a panic disorder. A marble burying test as an animal model for an obsessive-compulsive disorder was also reported. However, establishment of the models for these disorders remains for future investigations.", 
    "145": "The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease among institutionalised intellectually disabled individuals with an IQ < 50 is high: about 50% have an deviant 24-hour pH measurement and 70% of them have refluxoesophagitis. Intellectually disabled individuals have an increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease in case of cerebral palsy, IQ < 35, scoliosis, use of anticonvulsant drugs or benzodiazepines, not being ambulant, and in case of symptoms such as haematemesis, rumination or dental erosions. To establish the diagnosis is difficult because of the aspecific symptoms. Reflux disease is only diagnosed at a late stage. 24-hour pH measurement should be used in all those intellectually disabled individuals in whom gastroesophageal reflux disease is clinically suspected. For the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in adults as well as children, proton pump inhibitors are highly effective, independent of the severity of oesophagitis. Marked improvement of symptoms and quality of life can be noticed after treatment.", 
    "146": "Sedation techniques for patients undergoing minor outpatient surgery frequently include a variety of intravenous agents. The present study was designed to look for differential effects of 2 different sedation regimens on perioperative mood states. Twenty-two patients undergoing upper extremity surgery using local anesthesia were randomized to receive either propofol or midazolam intravenously for intraoperative sedation. Subjects were asked to complete a Profile of Mood States survey before and after surgery. The results of this survey were examined for differences in mood between the 2 groups that may be attributable to differences in drug effect. No significant differences were identified between propofol or midazolam regarding their effect on patient mood. Patients in both groups experienced a reduction in perioperative anxiety.", 
    "147": "Drug development involves the chemical identification and characterization of a compound to determine stability and define the drug's preliminary actions. Preclinical research follows in animals to develop a pharmacokinetic profile to determine dose range, biotransformation, elimination, and toxicology. The 4 phases of clinical research, phase 1 to phase 4, encompass a progressive investigation of healthy subjects, otherwise healthy patients, to patients with a target disease to obtain US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Clinical studies include open-label noncomparative studies during phases 1 and 2, and double-blind, comparative, and placebo-controlled studies during phases 2 and 3. Approval from the FDA follows the successful evaluation of the drug. After drug marketing, phase 4 clinical trials continue to collect safety and efficacy information. Many drugs that undergo this drug development process succeed in obtaining FDA approval and are marketed for clinical use. There are several circumstances, however, that preclude the successful completion of drug development, FDA approval, and marketing. This study describes a clinical trial of a new benzodiazepine, Ro 48-6791. Ro 48-6791 was being developed as an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine with clinical effects of shorter duration than midazolam. The purpose of this study was to define a safe dose range for the induction and maintenance of conscious sedation of patients in an outpatient gastroenterology laboratory. Efficacy criteria to be evaluated included time to onset of action, duration of action, and psychomotor fitness upon recovery. Patients were assessed by using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score (OAA/S) and a 5-m heel-toe-line-walk test (HTLW). The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 patients received Ro 48-6791. Group 2 patients were premedicated with meperidine before administration of Ro 48-6791. Ro 48-6791 was titrated over 30 seconds, and patients were observed for 90 seconds before the next dose was given. The OAA/S score, oxygen saturation, and vital signs were charted every minute through induction and every 5 minutes during the procedure. Patients received Ro 48-6791 until they reached on OAA/S score of 3, corresponding to slowed patient response to name calling. Group 1 (Ro 48-6791 alone) required greater induction doses and increased time to induction. Maintenance doses were the same for both groups. The duration of action of Ro 48-6791 as measured by the OAA/S score and HTLW test did not differ between groups. Ro 48-6791 seemed to be a safe and effective agent to achieve conscious sedation in outpatients undergoing short invasive procedures. However, clinical drug development of Ro 48-6791 was stopped because it did not meet the efficacy criteria of an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine.", 
    "148": "Exposure to diazepam (DZ) during the last week of in utero development in rats induces neurobehavioral effects that do not become apparent in exposed animals until young adult ages. Some of the effects are sex specific. This study evaluated the hypothesis that late gestational exposure to DZ, a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptors, affects the developmental appearance of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an effect that could be linked to the later consequences of the exposure. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were injected with DZ (2.5 mg/kg) over gestation days 14-20, and their male and female offspring were evaluated for levels of BDNF mRNA and protein in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus at fetal day 20 and at postnatal ages spanning birth to young adulthood. The effects of the exposure were sex and region specific. At fetal day 20 the expression of BDNF was reduced by about 20% in the hypothalamus of males only. The early exposure affected postnatal expression of BDNF in the hypothalamus only modestly, influencing the age-related profile in both sexes. Postnatal development of BDNF in the cerebral cortex was significantly affected by the in utero exposure in males only with mRNA levels lower in the exposed group and protein levels higher during juvenile ages. At adulthood, both levels were lower in DZ-exposed males. GABA serves a role as a trophic factor during early development, and these results suggest that manipulation of GABA(A) receptors during early development could interact with the developmental action of other trophic factors thereby leading to altered neural organization and later neurobehavioral dysfunction.", 
    "149": "Selective CCK-A agonist activity has been reported to induce satiety in a variety of animals, including man, and thereby suggests a therapeutic role for CCK in the management of obesity. To date, three general classes of CCK-A agonists have been reported, the full-length, sulfated hepta- and hexapeptides, a series of tetrapeptides, and most recently a series of benzodiazepines. The SAR of the hexa- and tetrapeptide classes suggests that the Hpa(SO(3)H) and Tac groups may not interact at the CCK-A receptor in the same location. However, the C-terminal dipeptide part of the hexapeptides and tetrapeptides appear to interact at the CCK-A receptor in a similar manner. Compound 7 (Hpa-Nle-Gly-Trp-Lys(Tac)-Asp-MePhe-NH(2)) derived from combining the features of the hexapeptides and the tetrapeptides has subnanomolar affinity and 3500-fold selectivity for CCK-A receptors. Compound 7 administered intraperitoneally produces potent, long-lasting reduction in food intake in rats and a corresponding weight loss when administered over nine consecutive days.", 
    "150": "CCK released by intraluminal stimuli modifies duodenal activity contributing to a decrease in gastric emptying. However, the neural mechanisms by which CCK controls motility are not well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between CCK and the enteric nervous system through the study of the effects of CCK-8 on ascending excitation. Anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared with a strain-gauge sutured to the duodenum wall. An electrode holder was placed in the duodenum lumen to elicit ascending contraction. Electrical field stimulation of the duodenal mucosa (4 Hz, 0.6 ms, 30 V) induced an ascending excitation which was blocked by hexamethonium (10 mg kg-1; n=5) and atropine (0.3 mg kg-1; n=5), but enlarged by L-NNA (10(-5) mol kg-1; n=5). CCK-8 (3 \u00bf 10(-9) mol kg-1 10 min-1) blocked ascending excitation and an inhibition of the induced phasic activity was observed instead (n=18). Individually, none of the CCK receptor antagonists (L-364 718 and L-365 260) (3 \u00bf 10(-7) mol kg-1; n=6 each) blocked the inhibition of ascending excitation induced by CCK-8. However, simultaneous infusion of both antagonists abolished CCK-8 effect on electrical stimulation (n=5). Similarly, none of the CCK-8 agonists (A-71623, A-71378, gastrin) modified the ascending excitation. In contrast, the simultaneous infusion of A-71623 and CCK-4 (n=4) induced an effect similar to CCK-8. In conclusion, CCK-8 blocked ascending contraction elicited by electrical field stimulation of duodenal mucosa by means of simultaneous activation of CCK-A and CCK-B receptors.", 
    "151": "Clobazam is a newer 1,5-benzodiazepine used for the treatment of epilepsy. It is better tolerated and less sedating than other benzodiazepines. It has yet to gain wide use for epilepsy in the Middle East. Our objective is to report our experience with clobazam for the treatment of childhood epilepsy.", 
    "152": "A cohort of children with intractable epilepsy, defined as recurrent seizures after at least 3 anti-epileptic medication trials, were included prospectively. Clobazam was added to a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Follow-up by two pediatric neurologists was performed. Therapeutic response was recorded as complete (no seizures), good (>50% seizure reduction), fair (<50% seizure reduction), or none.", 
    "153": "Thirty one children (21 males - 10 females), aged 2 months-15 years (mean 4.6 years) were followed for 3-12 months. Most children (68%) had daily seizures and were on multiple anti-epileptic drugs (mean 2.3, +/- SD 1). Fourteen (45%) children had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. After the introduction of clobazam, 11 (35.5%) became completely seizure free and 14 (45%) had >50% seizure reduction. Side effects were reported in 7 (22.5%) in the form of excessive sedation, vomiting, irritability, behavioral change, and ataxia. In 4 children these side effects resolved either spontaneously or with dose reduction.", 
    "154": "Clobazam is a well tolerated, safe, and very effective antiepileptic drug. It has a broad spectrum of antiepileptic activity, minimal side effects, and is relatively inexpensive. Wider use of this drug is recommended in children with intractable epilepsy.", 
    "155": "Abstract This study evaluated the concordance of concomitant urinalysis and clinical assessments of drug abusers included in a methadone maintenance programme. The agreement between a clinical subjective score and an objective biological score, both measuring the evolution of illicit substance consumption over 12 months, was analysed. The clinical score, established by physicians and applied during patient interviews, was determined at entry into the programme and re-evaluated after 6 and 12 months. Forty-one patients were evaluated. The urinalysis score was based on regular screening of urine samples with the EMIT method. Agreement between the two scores was determined by using the kappa coefficient for each substance (opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine) for each time-point. The calculated kappa coefficients showed poor agreement between the two scores, but could indicate the complementarity of these clinical and biological appraisals. Indeed, the urinalysis objectively detected change in drug use before the clinician. Thus, urinalysis monitoring should be considered as an additional and complementary biological procedure for patient follow-up by physicians.", 
    "156": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), widely recognized as a definite clinical entity, has an estimated prevalence of 1 to 15% in different ethnic populations. However, it remains an underdiagnosed condition and its symptoms are frequently ascribed to stress and anxiety. Advancement in modern imaging techniques and clinical drug trials provide evidence of an impaired dopaminergic system in RLS. Management involves investigating and correcting treatable secondary causes, avoidance of aggravating factors, and pharmacologic therapy. Recent controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of dopamine agonists such as pramipexole and pergolide. Additional research is needed to further elucidate the pathophysiology of RLS, through obtaining post-mortem specimens and refinement of neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques. Isolation of specific genetic loci in familial cases would enable better characterization of distinct clinical and genetic subsets of RLS and result in better understanding of this disease at the molecular level.", 
    "157": "It has been known for many years that diagnosis within the neurotic spectrum of disorders is temporally unstable and also that life events can be major precipitants of change in symptoms. Reasons for this instability could include inherent inadequacy of current diagnostic practice, the influence of life events as an agent of diagnostic shift, and an innate course of disorder with features dependent on the stage at which disorder presents (e.g., development of panic to agoraphobia). These possibilities were examined in a prospective study that was initially a randomised controlled trial. Two hundred ten patients recruited from primary care psychiatric clinics with DSM-III diagnosed dysthymic, generalised anxiety, and panic disorders were randomly allocated to either drug treatment (mainly antidepressants), cognitive-behaviour therapy, or self-help therapy over a 2 year period, irrespective of original diagnosis. Life events were recorded by using a standard procedure over the period 6 months before starting treatment and at five occasions over 2 years; 181 (86%) of the patients had follow-up data and 76% maintained compliance with the original treatment allocated over the 2 years; and 155 of the 181 patients (86%) had at least one diagnostic change in this period. There was no difference in the number of diagnostic changes between the three original diagnostic groups, but dysthymic disorder changed more frequently to major depressive episode than did GAD or panic disorder (20; 11; 12) (%) and panic disorder changed more frequently to agoraphobia (with or without panic) than did dysthymia or GAD (18; 8; 6) (%). There was no relationship between loss events and depressive diagnoses or between addition events and anxiety diagnoses, but greater numbers of conflict events were associated with diagnostic change. More life events were associated with the flamboyant and dependent personality disorders, reinforcing other evidence that many life events are internally generated by personality characteristics and cannot be regarded as truly independent.", 
    "158": "The MIN6 pancreatic beta-cell line responds to glutamate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate, but not N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or 1S,3R-trans-ACPD, with increases in [Ca2+]i. This correlates with MIN6 expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1-4) but only weak expression of NMDA NR2 receptor subunits, as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pharmacological characterization of the MIN6 AMPA receptors showed that AMPA-triggered [Ca2+]i responses were blocked by GYKI 52466, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and pentobarbital. AMPA-triggered [Ca2+]i responses were also blocked in Na(+)-free medium and by the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel antagonist La3+. Unlike cortical neuronal cultures, which show a loss of membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) activity and die in response to excitatory amino acid exposure, glutamate was not toxic to MIN6 cells and it did not decrease PKC activity. These studies indicate that MIN6 cells possess Ca(2+)-impermeable AMPA receptors that secondarily allow Ca2+ influx following AMPA-induced depolarization and that, despite elevating [Ca2+]i, AMPA is not toxic to these cells. The effects of glutamate and glutamate receptor antagonists on pancreatic cells needs to be better understood if these compounds are to be used as therapeutic agents to treat stroke."
