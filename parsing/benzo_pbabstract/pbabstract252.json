The study involved 10 young, healthy male subjects who had given their written informed consent to participate. Either a placebo (PLA), 0.125 mg triazolam (TRZ), 0.25 mg TRZ or 0.25 mg brotizolam (BRZ) was administered to the subjects in a double-blind crossover design by randomized allocation with a single oral administration at 23.00 h. A polysomnography (PSG) was recorded for each subject from 23.00 to 07.00 h the following day. Then, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and Kwansei Gakuin Sleepiness Scale (KSS) were checked between 07.55 and 08.00 h, and the sleep latency test (SLT) was performed between 08.00 and 08.20 h. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were then recorded with an oddball paradigm; the reaction time (RT) was measured simultaneously. According to the PSG, treatment with 0.25 mg TRZ resulted in a statistically significant increase in the percentage of stage 2 sleep (p < 0.05) and a reduction in the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep (p < 0.05) compared with PLA. None of the drugs had any effect on the percentage of slow-wave sleep compared with PLA. With regard to carryover effects, although none of the drugs had any effect on SSS, KSS, RT or ERPs, BRZ did cause a statistically significant decrease in sleep latency (p < 0.05) compared with PLA. TRZ (0.125 and 0.25 mg) and 0.25 mg BRZ exerted different effects on SLT. We suggest that these different effects are attributable to differences in the half-life of these hypnotics.", 
    "1": "Several clinical reports have demonstrated that most antipsychotics of the new generation, but not the typical antipsychotic haloperidol, induce weight gain in schizophrenic patients. Since weight gain induces serious health complications in humans, it is crucial to test upcoming antipsychotic compounds in an animal model of weight gain. With the aim of evaluating whether the rat can be used as a model for antipsychotic-induced weight gain, we have investigated the effect of chronic treatment (3 weeks) with one antipsychotic drug inducing weight gain in clinic (olanzapine) and one antipsychotic not inducing weight gain in clinic (haloperidol), on food and water intake and body weight gain in rats. We included both female and male rats in this study. To reduce spontaneous high food intake in rats, and to be able to evaluate the treatment effect on a potential increase of food intake or metabolic changes, we allowed animal to receive only low-palatability chow. In male rats, none of the two compounds induced weight gain, but in female rats, both compounds induced weight gain. Consequently, the effect observed in rats does not match the clinical situation, and Wistar rats in this set-up cannot be considered a relevant model for antipsychotic-induced weight gain in humans.", 
    "2": "Case studies reveal that opiate addicts often self-medicate with benzodiazepine (BDZ) tranquilizers prior to taking their opiate. Our laboratory has previously utilized the conditioned place preference paradigm to confirm that BDZs can augment the affective response to heroin in laboratory animals. The combination of alprazolam and varying doses of intravenous heroin resulted in a leftward shift of the heroin dose-response curve. The present experiment was devised to extend the previous findings by examining the ability of varying alprazolam doses (0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mg/kg ip) to potentiate the reward of a single challenge dose of heroin (0.025 mg/kg iv). The results demonstrate that a nonrewarding dose of alprazolam (0.125 mg/kg) and intravenous heroin can interact to produce reliable place preferences. The data thereby support prior work from our laboratory regarding the synergistic actions of BDZs and opiates.",

Risperidone-treated patients stayed a mean of 9 fewer days in the hospital compared with olanzapine-treated patients (49 vs. 58 days; p =.007). The possibility that these observed differences were a result of different baseline characteristics could not be entirely discounted. Mean +/- SD doses of risperidone and olanzapine were 5.5 +/- 2.4 mg/day and 14.1 +/- 4.7 mg/day, respectively. The mean daily cost of all inpatient drugs was significantly higher for olanzapine than for risperidone (pound 5.63 vs. pound 3.92; p <.0001). Mean total costs of all inpatient drugs were significantly higher for olanzapine than for risperidone (pound 164 vs. pound 96; p <.0001), which partly reflected the longer mean treatment duration for olanzapine compared with risperidone (44 vs. 37 days). Concomitant antipsychotic use was similar for both groups (66% risperidone, 67% olanzapine).

Fifteen healthy volunteers were given one of the three hypnotics at each drug session, which lasted for 1 week, in a single-blind cross-over fashion. No significant between-drug difference was observed for the psychomotor performance assessed by CPT. Subjective hangover effects assessed by SSS and SEQ in the morning were prominent for flunitrazepam and quazepam relative to triazolam, whereas objective indices such as MSLT or activity counts obtained in actigraphy indicated a marked hangover effect of quazepam compared with the other two compounds restrictively in the afternoon, which were nearly in accordance with their pharmacokinetic profiles.",

Stenting the ductus arteriosus and subsequent banding of the pulmonary arteries allows the combination of neoaortic reconstruction with the establishment of a bidirectional cavopulmonary connection (combined stage 1 and 2 procedure) in a later session. We report the anaesthetic management in eight infants ranging from 107 to 195 days undergoing a combined stage 1 and 2 procedure. Nonselective pulmonary vasodilators and nitric oxide were needed in all cases to improve oxygen saturation in the postbypass period. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors and epinephrine were required in all patients for inotropic support during and after weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. The procedure was successful in seven patients. One patient died intraoperatively because of right heart failure. The physiological changes of this new surgical strategy for palliation of HLHS offers a challenge for the anaesthetist primarily in the early postbypass period.",

We report a boy who had suffered for years from poorly controlled PSVT because of noncompliance to medications and was being sedated by midazolam and morphine (4 mg each) and prepared for radiofrequency ablation when he began attempting to speak, writhing and flailing his arms, for which physical restraint was required. We also review the current knowledge on the subject. Two doses of flumazenil 0.05 mg i.v. swiftly halted the untoward episode. The child opened his eyes and was calm, coherent and able to answer simple questions. All haemodynamic and respiratory parameters remained stable throughout this event, except for a temporary increase in heart rate (from 68 to 83 b x min-1). The aberrant behaviour did not resume when he was allowed to fall asleep during the ablation of a concealed left lateral accessory pathway. After that procedure, he awoke calm and pain free with no recollection of the aggressive episode. He was kept for 24 h in an intermediate cardiac care unit and was then discharged home. This apparent first report on the efficacious use of flumazenil for the reversal of a paradoxical reaction to midazolam during an electrophysiological study suggests that it neither induces abnormal heart rate nor interferes with the electrophysiological study or the ablation procedure.",

The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is expressed on microglia and up-regulated after neuronal injury. [11C]PK11195 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for the PBR. The objective of the present study was to investigate [11C]PK11195 imaging in MS patients and its additional value over magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) concerning the immuno-pathophysiological process. Seven healthy and 22 MS subjects were included. Semiquantitative [11C]PK11195 uptake values were assessed with normalization on cortical grey matter. Uptake in Gadolinium-lesions was significantly increased compared with normal white matter. Uptake in T2-lesions was generally decreased, suggesting a PBR down-regulation. However, uptake values increased whenever a clinical or MR-relapse was present, suggestive for a dynamic process with a transient PBR up-regulation. During disease progression, an increase of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) uptake was found, propagating NAWM as the possible real burden of disease. In conclusion, [11C]PK11195 and PET are able to demonstrate inflammatory processes with microglial involvement in MS.", 
    "52": "The dentate gyrus (DG) normally functions as a filter, preventing propagation of synchronized activity into the seizure-prone hippocampus. This filter or 'gatekeeper' attribute of the DG is compromised in various pathological states, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study examines the role that altered inhibition may play in the deterioration of this crucial DG function. Using the pilocarpine animal model of TLE, we demonstrate that inhibitory synaptic function is altered in principal cells of the DG. Spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded in dentate granule cells (DGCs) from epileptic animals were larger, more sensitive to blockade by zinc and less sensitive to augmentation by the benzodiazepine type site 1 modulator zolpidem. Furthermore, mIPSCs examined during a quiescent period following injury but preceding onset of epilepsy were significantly smaller than those present either in control or in TLE DGCs, and had already acquired sensitivity to blockade by zinc prior to the onset of spontaneous seizures. Rapid agonist application experiments demonstrated that prolonged (>35 ms) exposure to zinc is required to block GABAA receptors (GABAARs) in patches pulled from epileptic DGCs. Therefore, zinc must be tonically present to block DGC GABAARs and alter DG function. This would occur only during repetitive activation of mossy fibres. Thus, in the pilocarpine animal model of TLE, an early, de novo, expression of zinc-sensitive GABAARs is coupled with delayed, epilepsy-induced development of a zinc delivery system provided by aberrant sprouting of zinc-containing mossy fibre recurrent collaterals. The temporal and spatial juxtaposition of these pathophysiological alterations may compromise normal 'gatekeeper' function of the DG through dynamic zinc-induced failure of inhibition, predisposing the hippocampal circuit to generate seizures.",

Almost all physicians had heard of naltrexone and disulfiram, but their self-reported level of knowledge about these medications was lower than for antidepressants. Physicians estimated that naltrexone had a small-to-medium effect size, which was similar in magnitude to the effect size reported in recent meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials.

Conventional benzodiazepines, such as triazolam and midazolam, were the treatment of choice for short-term insomnia for many years but are associated with adverse effects such as rebound insomnia, withdrawal and dependency. The newer hypnosedatives include zolpidem, zaleplon and zopiclone. These agents may be preferred over conventional benzodiazepines to treat short-term insomnia because they may be less likely to cause significant rebound insomnia or tolerance and are as efficacious as the conventional benzodiazepines. This review aims to summarise the published clinical drug interaction studies involving zolpidem, zaleplon and zopiclone. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions that may be clinically important are highlighted. Clinical trials have studied potential interactions of zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone with the following types of drugs: cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducers (rifampicin), CYP inhibitors (azoles, ritonavir and erythromycin), histamine H(2) receptor antagonists (cimetidine and ranitidine), antidepressants, antipsychotics, antagonists of benzodiazepines and drugs causing sedation. Rifampicin significantly induced the metabolism of the newer hypnosedatives and decreased their sedative effects, indicating that a dose increase of these agents may be necessary when they are administered with rifampicin. Ketoconazole, erythromycin and cimetidine inhibited the metabolism of the newer hypnosedatives and enhanced their sedative effects, suggesting that a dose reduction may be required. Addition of ethanol to treatment with the newer hypnosedatives resulted in additive sedative effects without altering the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs. Compared with some of the conventional benzodiazepines, fewer clinically important interactions appear to have been reported in the literature with zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone. The fact that these drugs are newer to the market and have not been as extensively studied as the conventional benzodiazepines may be the reason for this. Another explanation may be a difference in CYP metabolism. While triazolam and midazolam are biotransformed almost entirely via CYP3A4, the newer hypnosedatives are biotransformed by several CYP isozymes in addition to CYP3A4, resulting in CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers having a lesser effect on their biotransformation.", 
    "66": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether midazolam exhibits characteristics of a highly permeable P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate and to evaluate the potential influence of P-gp inhibition on 1-OH midazolam formation during midazolam transport.", 
    "67": "P-gp interaction was investigated by P-gp ATPase assay, efflux inhibition studies, and transport studies of midazolam across MDR1-MDCK and 1-alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3-induced Caco-2 monolayers with and without the P-gp inhibitor GF120918.", 
    "68": "Midazolam was highly permeable and transport appeared essentially unpolarized. In MDR1-MDCK, the basolateral-to-apical (B-to-A) permeability was slightly higher (16%) than apical-to-basolateral (A-to-B) permeability (p = 0.04); GF120918 increased A-to-B permeability by 27% (p = 0.01), and increased cellular midazolam accumulation during A-to-B transport by 45% (p = 0.01). Midazolam (200 microM) decreased rhodamine123 and vinblastine B/A ratios 3-fold (p < 0.006), while increasing their cellular accumulation (p < 0.003). P-gp ATPase activation by midazolam was dose-dependent and saturable [Km = 11.5(+/- 4.0) microM; Vmax = 41.1(+/- 7.4) nmol/mg/min]. P-gp inhibition increased 1-OH midazolam formation in A-to-B studies 1.3-fold when midazolam donor > or = 10 microM (p < 0.03). In B-to-A studies, P-gp inhibition did not significantly increase metabolite formation (p = 0.06). Midazolam's extraction ratio was not influenced by P-gp (p = 0.2).", 
    "69": "The results indicate that midazolam exhibited characteristics of a highly permeable P-gp substrate. 1-OH midazolam formation during A-to-B midazolam transport increased slightly when P-gp was inhibited.", 
    "70": "Intravenous anaesthetic agents are generally remarkably safe. However, it is clear that propofol infusion syndrome is a real, albeit rare, entity. This often lethal syndrome of metabolic acidosis, acute cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy is strongly associated with infusions of propofol at rates of 5 mg/kg/hour and greater for more than 48 hours. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that the syndrome is caused by the failure of free fatty acid metabolism due to inhibition of free fatty acid entry into the mitochondria and also specific sites in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The syndrome therefore mimics the mitochondrial myopathies. Midazolam causes seizure-like activity in very-low-birthweight premature infants requiring the drug prior to tracheal intubation or during prolonged positive pressure ventilation. This can be successfully reversed with the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Midazolam can also cause paradoxical reactions, including increased agitation, poor co-operation and aggressive or violent behaviour, which has been successfully managed with flumazenil.", 
    "71": "The present study examined the sleep microstructure in relation to insomnia and chronic use of benzodiazepines in older adults.", 
    "72": "The participants were 46 older adults, aged 55 or older (mean age = 62.9), who were divided into three groups: insomnia sufferers using BZ chronically (n = 15), drug-free insomnia sufferers (n = 15), and self-defined good sleepers (n = 16).", 
    "73": "Participants completed 3 consecutive nights of polysomnography in the laboratory. Spectral analyses were carried on the second night of sleep recordings. Stages 2, 3, and 4 of the first 4 cycles of the second night were retained for the analysis.", 
    "74": "Results showed no significant differences between drug-free insomnia sufferers and good sleepers. However, benzodiazepine users exhibited significantly less delta and theta activity over the night than did good sleepers. When compared to drug-free insomnia sufferers, benzodiazepine users had less delta and theta activity within cycle 2 only. Regarding high-frequency bands, benzodiazepine users had more beta 1 activity within cycle 3 than did good sleepers and more than both drug-free insomnia sufferers and good sleepers within cycle 4.", 
    "75": "The findings show that spectral analysis is an efficient tool to detect and quantify the effects of benzodiazepine use on sleep structure, particularly with older adults, a group for whom macrostructure sleep alterations due to physiologic aging are hard to distinguish from sleep changes induced by insomnia and the use of hypnotic drugs. In addition, these results raise important questions about the effects and indications of prolonged use of benzodiazepine medications in older adults with insomnia complaints.", 
    "76": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes a variety of neuromodulatory processes during development as well as in adulthood. This neurotrophin has been associated with synaptic plasticity, suggesting that its regulation may represent one of the mechanisms through which psychotropic drugs alter brain function. Because reduced glutamatergic function represents a major feature of schizophrenia, we investigated the effects of the concomitant administration of haloperidol or olanzapine with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 on BDNF expression. MK-801 reduces the hippocampal expression of the neurotrophin; this effect was exacerbated by haloperidol, but it was normalized by olanzapine. Our data reveal a fine tuning of BDNF biosynthesis and a differential modulation by antipsychotic drugs when NMDA-mediated transmission is reduced, suggesting that haloperidol and olanzapine can produce different effects on brain plasticity through the modulation of BDNF expression.", 
    "77": "A set of 10 compounds, each combining the seco-1,2,9,9a-tetrahydrocyclopropa[c]benz[e]indol-4-one (seco-CBI) and pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) pharmacophores, was designed and prepared. These compounds were anticipated to cross-link between N3 of adenine and N2 of guanine in the minor groove of DNA. The compounds, which differ in the chain length separating the two alkylation subunits, and the configuration of the CBI portion, showed great variation in cellular toxicity (over 4 orders of magnitude in a cell line panel) with the most potent example exhibiting IC50s in the pM range. Cytotoxicity correlated with the ability of the compounds to cross-link naked DNA. Cross-linking was also observed in living cells, at much lower concentrations than for a related symmetrical PBD dimer. A thermal cleavage assay was used to assess sequence selectivity, demonstrating that the CBI portion controlled the alkylation sites, while the PBD substituent increased the overall efficiency of alkylation. Several compounds were tested for in vivo activity using a tumor growth delay assay against WiDr human colon carcinoma xenografts, with one compound (the most cytotoxic and most efficient cross-linker) showing a statistically significant increase in survival time following a single iv dose.", 
    "78": "Spasticity is one of the clinical signs observed after a lesion of the pyramidal tract. Clinical manifestations are polymorphous and depend on the location of the lesion on the pre-motoneuron. Functional consequences are also variable. Only negative effects such as painful spasms, stiffness, distortions, are to be treated. Three different categories of drugs are available: GABA-like (baclofen, benzodiazepine), central alpha 2 agonists (tizanidine, clonidine) and peripheral anti-spastics (dantrolene). Baclofen remains the most commonly used anti-spastic. The preferential indication is spasticity from spinal cord disease, especially when the aetiology is multiple sclerosis. Efficacy of benzodiazepines (diazepam, tetrazepam, clonazepam) is comparable with baclofen; however, side effects (drowsiness) are more frequent. Benzodiazepines are indicated when spasticity is associated with anxiety. Tizanidine is an efficient and well tolerated antispastic. In France, prescription requires a temporary authorization of use. Dantrolen has a peripheral mechanism of action and can be prescribed in the different forms of spasticity. There are other compounds with anti-spastic properties (gabapentine, cyproheptadine, piracetam). Their advantage is rather limited when used alone. Generally, they are administrated in combinaison with usual anti-spastic drugs.", 
    "79": "Different pharmacological agents have been used for sedation in children undergoing invasive procedures. The authors prospectively evaluated the efficacy, the occurrence of adverse side effects, and cardiovascular parameters in midazolam and ketamine sedation for invasive procedures in children with malignancies and hematological disorders. A total of 183 invasive procedures were performed on 63 children (mean age 9.2 +/- 5.2 years). Intravenous sedation consisted of 0.1 mg midazolam/kg and 1.0 mg ketamine/kg. Incremental dosages of ketamine (0.33 mg/kg) were given if necessary to maintain deep sedation. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded. All 183 invasive procedures were successfully completed with satisfactory sedation levels in 170 procedures (92.9%; 95% CI:88.2-96.2%). In 33 procedures (18%; 95% CI: 12.8-24.4%) sedation was associated with side effects, the most common being oxygen desaturation. One patient experienced a transient episode of laryngospasm. There was a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate after ketamine medication (p <.01). Procedure and recovery time were correlated to ketamine dosage (p <.01). The combination of midazolam and ketamine is efficacious in achieving deep sedation for painful invasive procedures. Considering the possibility of potentially serious respiratory complications it should be performed only by physicians who are trained in advanced airway management and life support. As opposed to many other sedative drugs with cardio-depressant properties, ketamine causes a rise in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate.", 
    "80": "1. Although multiple cytochrome P450s (CYP) contribute to hepatic phase I metabolism, CYP3A is the principal subfamily present in human and mouse small intestine. 2. Differences in phase I metabolism were investigated using midazolam (MDZ) hydroxylation in mouse liver and intestinal microsomes. The net MDZ metabolite formation rate in intestinal microsomes was approximately 30% that of liver microsomes (at 250 micro M MDZ). 3. Quantitative Western blotting with anti-CYP3A1 antibody detected two bands of immunoreactive protein in both liver and intestinal samples, 2.24 +/- 0.27 (mean +/- SD, n = 3) and 0.64 +/- 0.08 pmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. Qualitative Western blotting with anti-CYP2C11 antibody detected a single band of immunoreactive protein in liver microsomes and no signal in intestinal samples (1 micro g sample). 4. Ketoconazole potently inhibited formation of both alpha- and 4-OH-MDZ metabolites in intestinal microsomes (IC(50)' of 0.126 +/- 0.010 and 0.0955 +/- 0.014 micro M, respectively) and of 4-OH-MDZ formation in mouse liver microsomes (IC(50) of 0.041 +/- 0.003 micro M). However, ketoconazole (5 micro M) did not produce 50% inhibition of alpha-OH-MDZ formation in mouse liver microsomes. Inhibition by ritonavir (5 micro M) produced similar results. 5. MDZ hydroxylation is predominately CYP3A dependent in mouse intestine (compared with mouse liver) since CYP2C is not expressed in the intestine. The importance of CYP3A in the mouse intestine appears to mirror that in humans.", 
    "81": "A total of 338 cases of death from acute reactions to drugs in Galicia (NW Spain) from 1 June 1992 to 31 July 1997 were examined. The average annual mortality rate was close to 70 cases. Male victims (90%) prevailed over female ones, the average age at death being 28.8 years. Most of the victims were habitual users who died in their own homes (40%) or nearby (30%). Polydrug use was the most common pattern, the most frequently detected drugs being opioids (281 cases), followed by alcohol (128 cases), benzodiazepines (92 cases) and cocaine (75 cases). Although the intravenous route prevailed (91%), oral and inhalation consumption of the drugs were also significant--the latter has grown significantly in recent times in relation to opioids and other drugs. How accurate the certificate of death can be depends on how thorough the investigation at the crime scene, autopsy room and laboratory are, as well as appropriate knowledge of the individual's history. The coordinated action of different health care institutions and use of available resources are crucial with a view to obtaining such data.", 
    "82": "Baclofen (Lioresal) is a drug of choice to treat spasticity and is increasingly being administered intrathecally via an implantable pump in cases refractory to oral therapy. Emergency physicians will likely treat patients with baclofen withdrawal or overdose as this treatment becomes more widespread. The syndrome of baclofen withdrawal presents with altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, seizures, and rebound spasticity, and may be fatal if not treated appropriately. Baclofen withdrawal may mimic other diseases including sepsis, meningitis, autonomic dysreflexia, malignant hyperthermia, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Treatment consists of supportive care, reinstitution of baclofen, benzodiazepines, and diagnosis and eventual repair of intrathecal pump and catheter malfunction.", 
    "83": "We have designed and constructed an automated device for the production of ultra-high specific activity (11)C-labeled compounds via [(11)C]CH(3)I synthesized by the single pass I(2) method. The optimum condition for the production of [(11)C]CH(3)I was determined to be 630 degrees C for oven-1 (reaction column), 50 degrees C for oven-2 (iodine column) and 50 ml/min for the He gas flow rate, and gave the maximum conversion ratio of [(11)C]CH(3)I, 44%. [(11)C]Ro15-4513, known as an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, was produced under optimized conditions. An i.v. injectable [(11)C]Ro15-4513 solution of 1500 +/- 490 MBq (n = 6) with specific activity 4700 +/- 2500 GBq/micromol and a radiochemical purity of 98.2 +/- 2% was obtained automatically within 25 minutes (from EOB) by irradiating nitrogen gas containing 5% H(2) with 18 MeV protons (14.2 MeV on target) at 20 microA for 20 minutes. The highest specific activity of 9700 GBq/micromol (at EOS) could be achieved, although the radiochemical purity was 92.4%. By the use of the ultra-high specific activity [(11)C]Ro15-4513, the super high affinity binding sites in the rat brain hippocampus could be clearly visualized even at the extremely low concentration of 0.66 pM Ro15-4513 by in vitro autoradiography.", 
    "84": "Antipsychotic drugs reportedly show a common property in facilitating glutamatergic transmission in rat cerebral cortex. Since the binding of the radiolabelled channel blocker [3H]-MK801 is generally considered an affordable index of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive glutamate receptor activation, we examined the effects of clinically effective treatment (3 weeks, daily administration) of the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine (32 micromol/kg/5 ml) on the specific binding of [3H]-MK801 specific binding and on the strychnine-insensitive glycine sites (glycine B) in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) prepared from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats sacrificed after different (24, 60, 120 h) washout periods. We studied also the effects of repeated olanzapine administration on [3H]-ketanserin binding to 5HT2A receptors to verify whether, consistent with previously reported paradoxical effects of repeated administration of 5HT2A antagonists, this drug decreases 5HT2A receptor density without changing the apparent affinity. Neither single nor repeated olanzapine administration changed the kinetic characteristics of [3H]-MK801 or [3H]-glycine specific binding. When rats were sacrificed 120 h after the last olanzapine administration, both single or repeated treatment had failed to change the kinetic characteristics of [3H]-ketanserin binding, while the apparent affinity of 5HT2A receptors was increased in animals sacrificed at shorter (60 h) washout periods. Owing to the long half-life of olanzapine (24 h), and since the drug concentrations in mPFC of rats sacrificed 60 h after a single olanzapine administration (about 50 nM) are high enough to induce changes in 5HT2A receptor affinity, it is concluded that this modification, probably unrelated to the therapeutic efficacy, could be due to some drug still present in the brain at the time of the sacrifice.", 
    "85": "In membranes from rat cerebral cortex, cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) did not modulate basal [(3)H]-flunitrazepam binding at either 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C. At a concentration of 10(-6) M, CCK(-8) significantly decreased gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-stimulated (10(-6) M) [(3)H]-flunitrazepam binding at 37 degrees C. Scatchard analyses suggest that the decreased GABA-stimulated binding might be due to a decrease in the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors rather than to a decrease of number of binding sites. The observed modulation of benzodiazepine receptors by CCK-8 in vitro might explain some of the functional interactions between CCK and benzodiazepine systems.", 
    "86": "In Germany, the substitution of methadone for heroin abusers has arisen recently and has resulted in various medicolegal problems. Normally, these concern methadone-associated deaths, or the prescription of methadone resulting in criminal prosecutions concerning physicians. Not to be forgotten is the problem of driving while taking methadone. In the years 1997-2001, we detected methadone in the blood of 398 cases that were analysed by the Institute of Legal Medicine, Bonn. Methadone was the only drug in only 18 cases. In most of the cases, up to five additional drugs were also being taken: benzodiazepines (61%), ethanol (40%), morphine (39%), cannabinoids (35%), cocaine (28%), anti-depressants (3%), and amphetamines (2%).", 
    "87": "MK-801 (dizocilpine) is a non-competitive antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) family of glutamate receptors in the central nervous system. It is an anticonvulsant and also shares several pharmacological properties with phencyclidine and ketamine. It is not observed routinely as a substance of abuse. The deceased, a 45-year-old white male, obtained MK-801 surreptitiously in an attempt to treat a self-diagnosed depression. He was discovered the next morning, unresponsive on the bathroom floor. An empty bottle, labeled to contain 25mg of MK-801, was found near the body. The autopsy was performed at the Joseph A Jachimczyk Forensic Center, Houston, TX. Body weight at autopsy was 88kg. Lungs were edematous and congested (right: 775g; left 700g). The heart had proportionate chambers and was otherwise unremarkable. The kidneys (right: 220g; left 225g) were smooth surfaced. The brain (1550g) was congested and without trauma. Microscopic evaluation of the heart, kidneys and lungs showed normal histology and confirmed pulmonary congestion and edema. Samples of heart blood, liver, bile, vitreous humor, stomach contents and urine were collected at autopsy. There were 550ml of stomach contents. Drugs in blood were screened by EMIT II Plus immunoassay procedures and by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of an organic solvent extract of basified blood. Alcohol was determined by gas chromatography with headspace injection. MK-801, benzodiazepines and alcohol were detected in blood. Amounts of MK-801 present in blood, bile, liver, vitreous humor and urine were 0.15, 0.29, 0.92, less than 0.1 and 0.36 mg/l (kg), respectively. The cause of death was benzodiazepine, dizocilpine and ethanol toxicity and the manner accidental.", 
    "88": "A collaborative case-control study was conducted in France in order to determine the prevalence of alcohol, cannabinoids, opiates, cocaine metabolites, amphetamines and therapeutic psychoactive drugs in blood samples from drivers injured in road accidents and to compare these values with those of a control population. Recruitment was performed in emergency departments of six university or general hospitals and comprised 900 drivers involved in a non-fatal accident and 900 patients (controls) who attended the same emergency units for a non-traumatic reason. Drivers and controls were matched by sex and age. Alcohol was determined by flame ionization-gas chromatography, drugs of abuse (DOA) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the same analytical procedures in the six laboratories, and medicines by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Blood alcohol concentration exceeding 0.5 g/l (i.e. the legal French threshold) was found in 26% of drivers and 9% of controls. In the 18-27 years age range, alcohol was the only toxic found in blood samples of 17% drivers and 5% controls, leading to an odds-ratio (OR) of 3.8. A significant relationship was found between alcohol blood concentrations and OR values. All age groups confounded, the main active substance of cannabis, Delta(9) tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was found in 10% of drivers and 5% of controls. In the less than 27 years old, THC (>1 ng/ml) was detected alone in the blood of 15.3% drivers and of 6.7% controls, giving OR=2.5, whereas there was no link between THC blood concentrations and OR value. THC was found alone in 60% of cases and associated with alcohol in 32%, with OR=4.6 between drivers and controls for this association. The difference in morphine prevalence between drivers (2.7%) and controls (0.03%) was highly significant (P<0.001), with OR=8.2. The number of positive cases for amphetamines and cocaine metabolites was too low for reaching any interpretation. The most frequently observed psychoactive therapeutic drugs were by far benzodiazepines, that were found alone in 9.4% of drivers and 5.8% of controls, which led to OR=1.7 (P<0.01). This study demonstrates a higher prevalence of opiates, alcohol, cannabinoids and the combination of these last two compounds in blood samples from drivers involved in road accidents than in those from controls, which suggests a causal role for these compounds in road crashes.", 
    "89": "The increasing interest in toxicological hair analysis as a marker of human exposure to xenobiotics such as illicit substances or therapeutic drugs, has been made feasible by the extension of mass spectrometry, a highly sensitive method of detection. A newborn exposed to drugs in utero can suffer from a varying degree of withdrawal syndrome, a few days after birth. If of opiate origin, the withdrawal syndrome can be treated with morphine, among other therapeutics, but it is not easy to diagnose because of atypical symptoms presented by neonates and especially when maternal drug addiction has not been revealed. To assess and measure toxicological factors linked with the appearance and the severity of this syndrome, maternal and neonatal matrices such as urine, meconium and hair were collected during a protocol approved by the ethical committee. Opiates in particular were measured with GC-MS and potential combined dependences (cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD and benzodiazepines) and/or substitutive therapeutics (methadone or buprenorphine) were also assessed in 17 mother/neonate couples. Gestational opiate exposure profiles were drawn up and linked with the observed withdrawal syndromes. A withdrawal syndrome seems to appear more frequently after foetal exposure to an association of opiates/substitutive molecules (8 out of 10 withdrawal syndromes observed in this study), although the impact of cocaine and benzodiazepines must also be taken into account. The results obtained in neonatal hair make it possible to affirm foetal drug exposure and are in accordance, for the majority, with the appearance of a neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NWS). Neonatal hair analysis could contribute to assess in utero exposure to opiates, particularly when results in urine and meconium are negative or when these matrices are not available.", 
    "90": "The incorporation of eight benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, medazepam, oxazepam and triazolam) into rat hair was investigated by HPLC and GC-MS. Each of the benzodiazepines was injected daily into three Dark Agouti (DA) rats for 10 days at 10mg/kg. The back hair of the rats was removed by shaving prior to the first injection and again on the 28th day after the initial administration. To investigate optimum extraction conditions, 10mg aliquots of rat hair incorporated with diazepam, flurazepam or medazepam were extracted by seven different methods (Proteinase K, methanol-ammonia, methanol-trifluoroacetic acid, Soerensens buffer, 1M NaOH, beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase, Biopurase). The method found to yield the highest recoveries, for all three drugs, was the acidic methanol extraction. Using this extraction procedure, the incorporation rates (ICR: the ratio of the hair concentration to the plasma AUC) of eight benzodiazepines into rat hair were investigated. The ICRs ranged from 0.002 (flunitrazepam) to 0.049 (flurazepam). The major metabolites of flurazepam were investigated in rat hair. The mean hair concentrations of desalkylflurazepam and 2-hydroxyethylflurazepam were 3.31 and 0.05 ng/mg, respectively, which are 24 and 0.36% of the parent compound in hair.", 
    "91": "Channels were activated, in ripped-off patches from rat-cultured hippocampal neurons, by propofol alone, propofol plus 0.5 microM GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) or GABA alone. The propofol-activated currents were chloride-selective, showed outward-rectification and were enhanced by 1 microM diazepam. The maximum propofol-activated channel conductance increased with propofol concentration from less than 15 pS (10 microM) to about 60 pS (500 microM) but decreased to 40 pS in 1 mM propofol. Fitting the data from 10 to 500 microM propofol with a Hill-type equation gave a maximum conductance of 64 pS, an EC50 value of 32 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.1. Addition of 0.5 microM GABA shifted the propofol EC50 value to 10 microM and increased the maximum channel conductance to about 100 pS. The Hill coefficient was 0.8. The maximum channel conductance did not increase further when 1 microM diazepam was added together with a saturating propofol concentration and GABA. The results are compared to effects other drugs have on GABAA channels conductance.", 
    "92": "Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was microinjected into rat cerebral cortex and changes in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) binding and benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) binding were followed for 24 h after the infusion using [(3)H]-N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate ([(3)H]-NMPB) and [(3)H]-flumazenil, respectively, as a radioligand. The microinjection of SNP dose-dependently caused significant neural cell death 3 h after infusion, with the area of cell death becoming extensive 24 h after infusion. Neither SIN-1 nor NOC-18, other types of NO donors, caused neural cell death. Together with the result that deferoxamine, an iron-chelating agent, protected SNP-induced brain injury indicated important roles of iron-related radicals in SNP cytotoxicity in rat brain. In vitro [(3)H]-NMPB binding was significantly reduced in parallel with the time course of neural cell death detected by TTC staining and Nissl staining. In contrast, [(3)H]-flumazenil binding was essentially unaltered during the 24-h period after the SNP infusion. Similar results were observed in in vivo binding experiments. In vivo [(3)H]-NMPB binding was found to be much more sensitive at detecting cell death caused by SNP. On the other hand, [(3)H]-flumazenil binding in vivo was relatively insensitive to SNP-induced cell death. These results indicate that mAChR binding may be superior to BZR binding for detecting cell death in brain tissue, in contrast to what was previously thought.", 
    "93": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a prolonged form of cardiopulmonary bypass used to support patients with life-threatening respiratory or cardiac failure. In neonates, ECMO is used for a variety of indications, including sepsis and pulmonary diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension or congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In recent years, ECMO has been increasingly used after surgery to correct congenital cardiac defects. Despite the need for numerous drugs to maintain the ECMO circuit and treat the patient's underlying illness, relatively little is known of the disposition of drugs in this patient population. To date, the largest number of pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with gentamicin and vancomycin. Both drugs have been found to have an increased volume of distribution, probably as a result of the addition of a large exogenous blood volume for circuit priming. Elimination half-lives for both drugs are prolonged during ECMO, with several studies demonstrating a return to expected values after decannulation. The reason for this prolonged elimination is probably multifactorial, with a reduction in renal function as the primary determinant. This same pattern of an increased volume of distribution and prolonged elimination has been found for several other drugs, including tobramycin, bumetanide and ranitidine. Other factors that affect drug disposition during ECMO include loss of the drug from adhesion to the circuit components and loss in the circulating blood volume during changes in the equipment. The benzodiazepines and propofol are largely sequestered within the circuit. Serum concentrations of heparin, morphine, fentanyl, furosemide, phenytoin and phenobarbital are also reduced by these mechanisms. The addition of haemofiltration or dialysis in up to a quarter of ECMO patients further complicates the determination of population pharmacokinetic parameters. The literature published to date on the pharmacokinetic changes associated with ECMO provide preliminary support for dosage adjustment; however, more research is needed to identify optimal administration strategies for this patient population.", 
    "94": "A method for the synthesis of polymer-bound 7-acylamino-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones is described. The amino group of an alpha-amino acid is linked to polystyrene or TentaGel resin via reductive amination of polymer-bound 4-alkoxy-2,6-dimethoxybenzaldehyde. Acylation with unprotected 5-nitroanthranilic acid is followed by base-catalyzed ring closure. Reduction of the nitro group yields enantiomerically pure 7-aminobenzodiazepin-2,5-dione attached via the N-4 atom to the resin. Acylation of the amino group on the aromatic ring with acid chlorides in N-methylpyrrolidone (no DMF, no base!) followed by cleavage from the resin using TFA/Me(2)S/water (90:5:5) provides the acylated benzodiazepinones in 52-69% (PS resin) and 41-48% (TG resin) yield (based on the theoretical loading) and >70% purity (HPLC, 210 nm). Using Fmoc-protected tyrosine fluoride in NMP gives the amino acid-coupled benzodiazepinones in 24% (PS resin) and 31% (TG resin) yield.", 
    "95": "Type A cholecystokinin receptor (CCKAR) antagonists differing in blood-brain barrier permeability were used to test the hypothesis that satiety is mediated, in part, by CCK action at CCKARs located peripheral to the blood-brain barrier. At dark onset, non-food-deprived rats received a bolus injection of devazepide (2.5 micromol/kg iv), a 3-h infusion of A-70104 (1 or 3 micromol x kg-1 x h-1 iv), or vehicle either alone or coadministered with a 3-h infusion of CCK-8 (10 nmol x kg-1 x h-1 iv) or a 2-h intragastric infusion of peptone (1 g/h). Food intake was determined from continuous computer recordings of changes in food bowl weight. Devazepide penetrates the blood-brain barrier; A-70104, the dicyclohexylammonium salt of Nalpha-3-quinolinoyl-d-Glu-N,N-dipentylamide (A-65186), does not. CCK-8 inhibited 3-h food intake by more than 50% and both A-70104 and devazepide abolished this response. A-70104 and devazepide stimulated food intake and similarly attenuated the anorexic response to intragastric infusion of peptone. Thus endogenous CCK appears to act, in part, at CCKARs peripheral to the blood-brain barrier to inhibit food intake.",

The effects of surgery were studied based on endoscopic findings during drug-induced sleep and determination of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) before and after the operation. Changes in the form of the airway during sleep in the recumbent position were observed, and the role of upper airway endoscopy in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of OSAS was determined. The site of airway obstruction during sleep induced by i.v. injection of 10 mg of diazepam was classified into five types, and changes in AHI and the site of airway obstruction were compared before and after surgery. Changes in airway morphology during sleep in the supine and recumbent positions were also compared before surgery. The postoperative improvement rate was 74.4% for the soft palatal type of obstruction, 76.2% for the tonsillar type, 53.3% for the circumferential palatal type and 34.0% for the mixed type. Treatment produced excellent or good effects for the soft palatal and tonsillar types of obstruction. However, many patients with the circumferential palatal and mixed types of obstruction showed only some improvement or no change. Good airway morphology was maintained in the recumbent position by patients with the soft palatal type of obstruction. With the circumferential palatal and mixed types of obstruction, improvement can be expected from operations which include surgical treatment of the posterior pharyngeal wall or lateral funiculus, or with midline laser glossectomy. A good operative outcome can be predicted in patients showing improvement of apnea in the recumbent position preoperatively.",

It can progress rapidly to high fever, altered mental status, seizures, profound muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, brain injury, and death. Current therapy with oral baclofen and benzodiazepines is useful but has variable success, particularly in severe cases. We note that ITB withdrawal is similar to serotonergic syndromes, such as in overdoses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or the popular drug of abuse 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy). We postulate that ITB withdrawal may be a form of serotonergic syndrome that occurs from loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of serotonin.",

    "110": "Networks of interconnected inhibitory neurons, such as the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), often regulate neural oscillations. Thalamic circuits generate sleep spindles and may contribute to some forms of generalized absence epilepsy, yet the exact role of inhibitory connections within the TRN remains controversial. Here, by using mutant mice in which the thalamic effects of the anti-absence drug clonazepam (CZP) are restricted to either relay or reticular nuclei, we show that the enhancement of intra-TRN inhibition is both necessary and sufficient for CZP to suppress evoked oscillations in thalamic slices. Extracellular and intracellular recordings show that CZP specifically suppresses spikes that occur during bursts of synchronous firing, and this suppression grows over the course of an oscillation, ultimately shortening that oscillation. These results not only identify a particular anatomical and molecular target for anti-absence drug design, but also elucidate a specific dynamic mechanism by which inhibitory networks control neural oscillations.", 
    "111": "Essential tremor can cause significant functional disability in some patients. The arms are the most common body part affected and cause the most functional disability. The treatment of essential tremor includes medications, surgical options and other forms of therapy. Presently there is no cure for essential tremor nor are there any medications that can slow the progression of tremor. Treatment for essential tremor is recommended if the tremor causes functional disability. If the tremor is disabling only during periods of stress and anxiety, propranolol and benzodiazepines can be used during those periods when the tremor causes functional disability. The currently available medications can improve tremor in approximately 50% of the patients. If the tremor is disabling, treatment should be initiated with either primidone or propranolol. If either primidone or propranolol do not provide adequate control of the tremor, then the medications can be used in combination. If patients experience adverse effects with propranolol, occasionally other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (such as atenolol or metoprolol) can be used. If primidone and propranolol do not provide adequate control of tremor, occasionally the use of benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam) can provide benefit. Other medications that may be helpful include gabapentin or topiramate. If a patient has disabling head or voice tremor, botulinum toxin injections into the muscles may provide relief from the tremor. Botulinum toxin in the hand muscles for hand tremor can result in bothersome hand weakness and is not widely used. There are other medications that have been tried in essential tremor and have questionable efficacy. These drugs include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. methazolamide), phenobarbital, calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nimodipine), isoniazid, clonidine, clozapine and mirtazapine. If the patient still has disabling tremor after medication trials, surgical options are usually considered. Surgical options include thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the thalamus. These surgical options provide adequate tremor control in approximately 90% of the patients. Surgical morbidity and mortality for these procedures is low. Deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy have been shown to have comparable efficacy but fewer complications have been reported with deep brain stimulation. In patients undergoing bilateral procedures deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is the procedure of choice to avoid adverse effects seen with bilateral ablative procedures. The use of medication and/or surgery can provide adequate tremor control in the majority of the patients.",

    "117": "Ascending output from the basal ganglia to the primate motor thalamus is carried by GABAergic nigro- and pallido-thalamic pathways, which interact with intrinsic thalamic GABAergic systems represented in primates by local circuit neurons and axons of the reticular thalamic nucleus. Disease-triggered pathological processes in the basal ganglia can compromise any of these pathways either directly or indirectly, yet the effects of basal ganglia lesioning on its thalamic afferent-receiving territories has not been studied in primates. Two GABA(A) receptor ligands, [(3)H]muscimol and [(3)H]flunitrazepam, were used to study the distribution and binding properties of the receptor in intact monkeys, those with kainic acid lesions in the globus pallidus, and those with ibotenic acid lesions in the reticular nucleus using quantitative autoradiographic technique on cryostat sections of fresh frozen brain tissue. In control monkeys the binding affinities for [(3)H]muscimol averaged 50 nM in the thalamic nuclei and 86 nM in the basal ganglia while the binding densities varied (maximum density of binding sites [Bmax] range of 99.4-1000.1 fmol/mg of tissue). Binding affinities and Bmax values for [(3)H]flunitrazepam averaged 2.02 nM and 81-113 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively. Addition of 100-microM GABA increased average affinity to 1.35 nM whereas Bmax values increased anywhere from 1-50% in different nuclei. Zolpidem (100 nM) decreased binding by 68-80%. Bmax values for both ligands were decreased at the two survival times in both medial and lateral globus pallidus implying involvement of both nuclei in the lesion. Statistically significant, 40% decrease (P=0.055) of Bmax for [(3)H]muscimol was observed in the ventral anterior nucleus pars densicellularis (VAdc, the main pallidal projection territory in the thalamus) 1 week after globus pallidus lesioning and a 36% decrease (P=0.017) 4 months post-lesioning. In contrast, [(3)H]flunitrazepam Bmax values in the VAdc of the same animals were increased by 23% (P=0.021) at 1 week and 28% (P=0.005) 4 months postlesion, respectively. One week after the reticular nucleus lesioning, the binding densities of [(3)H]muscimol and [(3)H]flunitrazepam were decreased in the thalamic nuclei receiving projections from the lesioned reticular nucleus sector by approximately 50% (P<0.05) and 10-33% (P<0.05), respectively. The results suggest that different GABA(A) receptor subtypes are associated with different GABAergic systems in the thalamus which react differently to deafferentation.", 
    "118": "Opening of the permeability transition (PT) pore is a central feature of apoptosis induction by chemical stress. One component of the PT pore, the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR), has recently received attention for its potential role in modulating PT pore function. Specifically, antagonistic ligands of the mBzR, such as 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline-carboxamide (PK11195), have been shown to sensitize Bcl-2 overexpressing cells to apoptosis induction by facilitating the opening of the PT pore and the subsequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim). We examined whether PK11195 can sensitize EW36, a human B-cell lymphoma cell line that over-expresses Bcl-2, to apoptosis induction and mitochondrial depolarization by environmental chemicals including mitochondrial toxicants. We found that, although EW36 cells are refractory to apoptosis induction by antimycin A, rotenone, pyridaben, alachlor, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (mClCCP), they are dramatically sensitized to induction of apoptosis by low concentrations of these same agents following pre-treatment with PK11195. The sensitization of EW36 cells is accompanied by a rapid and extensive loss of Deltapsim within a few hours following chemical exposure. Furthermore, using sodium arsenite, we examined the role of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and protein synthesis in apoptosis induction in EW36. We found that, unlike untreated cells, EW36 cells treated with PK11195 no longer show an association of JNK pathway activation with apoptosis induction. Importantly, PK11195 eliminates a requirement for protein synthesis in chemically induced apoptosis in EW36 cells. These results show significant drug-mediated alteration of cell sensitivity and JNK pathway activation to environmental chemicals and mitochondrial toxicants, following ligation of the mBzR.", 
    "119": "The physiologic roles of dietary lecithin have not yet been clearly defined. We examined the effects of soybean lecithin on gastric emptying (Experiments 1 and 2) and food intake (Experiment 3) in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed 2 g of a 20 g lipid/100 g diet containing various levels of lecithin after 24 h of food deprivation; gastric contents were collected 3 h after feeding (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, the effects of lecithin and a CCK-A receptor antagonist on gastric emptying were examined using a modified phenol red recovery technique. In Experiment 3, their effects on food intake were examined after an intraduodenal infusion of an oil emulsion containing 50 mg soybean oil (SO) or SO partially replaced by lecithin (14-50%). Gastric emptying rates of the lipid and protein in the test diet (Experiment 1) or of phenol red (Experiment 2) were lower in the groups administered lecithin. Food intake for 60 min was lower in rats infused with the oil emulsion containing lecithin (25, 50%) than in rats not administered lecithin. The suppressive effects of lecithin on gastric emptying and food intake were largely reduced by devazepide. These results demonstrate that oil containing lecithin inhibits gastric emptying and food intake, and the effects are associated in part with CCK release.",

A gentle early long-lasting handling can prevent the deficits in locomotion and exploration in open field (O.F.) in 3-month-old male rats prenatally exposed to diazepam (DZ). Purpose of this study was to extend the research to older handled rats prenatally exposed to DZ and to assess the activity of 5-HT1A receptors (Rs), evaluating the performance in O.F. at 3 and 18 months of age following 8-OH-DPAT administration. A single daily s.c. injection of DZ (1.5 mg/kg) from gestation day 14 to gestation day 20 induced in aged, but not in young rats, a decrease in total distance travelled (TDT) and in rearing frequency (RF) and an increase of transitions from the periphery to the centre of the arena (CNT) and in the time spent in the centre of the arena (CAT), compared to controls. 8-OH-DPAT (0.150 mg/kg s.c.), given 1 h before testing, increased TDT and decreased RF, CNT and CAT in both vehicle- and DZ-exposed young rats. In aged rats prenatally exposed to DZ, 8-OH-DPAT induced an increase in TDT and a slight decrease in RF, CNT and CAT. These findings indicate that the effects of handling and of 8-OH-DPAT in prenatally DZ-exposed rats are age-dependent and suggest that O.F. test can represent a valid tool to identify the changes in 5-HT1A Rs activity following drug treatment.", 
    "121": "The present study investigated potential anti-cataleptic properties of the prototype atypical antipsychotic clozapine and two newly developed atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and quetiapine, which are structurally related and display similar pharmacological profiles to clozapine. Clozapine (2.5 mg kg(-1), s.c.), but not olanzapine (2.0 mg kg(-1), s.c.) and quetiapine (20.0 mg kg(-1), s.c.), blocked catalepsy induced either by the dopamine D(1/5) receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (50.0 microg kg(-1), s.c) or the selective dopamine D(2/3) receptor antagonist raclopride (4.0 mg kg(-1), s.c.). Such findings are consistent with the beneficial effects of clozapine in the management of drug-induced psychosis in parkinsonian patients, and suggest that neither olanzapine nor quetiapine may be a safe alternative to clozapine in this field. Furthermore, the results indicate that clozapine has a unique pharmacological profile that distinguishes it from olanzapine and quetiapine. The mechanisms underlying anti-cataleptic or anti-parkinsonian properties of clozapine are unclear but may be related to dopamine D(1) receptor agonism of clozapine.", 
    "122": "Improved drug therapy for schizophrenia may represent the best strategy for reducing the costs of schizophrenia and the recurrent chronic course of the disease. Olanzapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents developed to meet this need. We report a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, 30-week study designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and associated resource use for olanzapine and risperidone in Australia and New Zealand. The study sample consisted of 65 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. Olanzapine-treated patients showed a significantly greater reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, and PANSS General Psychopathology scores at endpoint compared to the risperidone-treated patients. Response rates through 30 weeks showed a significantly greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients had achieved a 20% or greater improvement in their PANSS total score compared to risperidone-treated patients. Olanzapine and risperidone were equivalent in their improvement of PANSS positive and negative scores and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) at endpoint. Using generic and disease-specific measures of quality of life, olanzapine-treated patients showed significant within-group improvement in most measures, and significant differences were observed in favor of olanzapine over risperidone in Quality of Life Scale (QLS) Intrapsychic Foundation and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item instrument (SF-36) Role Functioning Limitations-Emotional subscale scores.

Exposure of CHOm(1) cells to 6beta-acetoxy nortropane for 1 h significantly increased the secretion of secretory amyloid precursor protein (derived from alpha-secretase cleavage) in a concentration-dependent manner. In the same system, 6beta-acetoxy nortropane reduced the beta-amyloid peptide production. Similar results were obtained in hippocampal and cerebral cortical slices, with 6beta-acetoxy nortropane administration resulting in an increase in secretory amyloid precursor protein and a decrease in beta-amyloid peptide release. The increase of secretory amyloid precursor protein secretion was abolished by preincubation with selective muscarinic M(1) receptor antagonist pirenzepine, but not by preincubation with selective muscarinic M(2) receptor antagonist methoctramine, suggesting that 6beta-acetoxy nortropane promotes secretory amyloid precursor protein release in the brain via muscarinic M(1) receptor activation. These results suggest that 6beta-acetoxy nortropane could exert a beneficial effect on the progress of Alzheimer's disease by promoting amyloid precursor protein processing through alpha-secretase.", 
    "124": "During coevolution with their hosts, viruses have \"learned\" to intercept or to activate the principal signal transducing pathways leading to cell death. A number of proteins from pathophysiologically relevant viruses are targeted to mitochondria and regulate (induce or inhibit) the apoptosis-associated permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes. Such proteins are encoded by human immunodeficiency virus 1, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, human T-cell leukemia virus-1, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein Barr virus, among others. Within mitochondria, such apoptosis regulators from viral origin can target distinct proteins from the Bcl-2 family and the permeability transition pore complex including the adenine nucleotide translocase, cyclophilin D, the voltage-dependent anion channel, and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. Thus, viral proteins can regulate apoptosis at the mitochondrial level by acting on a variety of different targets.",

The most common ankle fracture was an isolated fibular fracture (prevalence, 57.6%), and the most common foot fracture was a fracture of the fifth metatarsal (56.9%). Women who sustained an ankle fracture had been slightly younger at the time of study enrollment than the women who did not sustain such a fracture (71.0 compared with 71.7 years), they had a higher body mass index (27.6 compared with 26.5), and they were more likely to have fallen within the twelve months prior to filling out the original questionnaire (38.1% compared with 29.7%). The appendicular bone mineral density was not significantly different between these two groups of subjects. Women who sustained a foot fracture had a lower bone mineral density in the distal part of the radius (0.345 g/cm (2) compared with 0.363 g/cm (2) ) and a lower calcaneal bone mineral density (0.394 g/cm (2) compared with 0.404 g/cm (2) ) than the women without a foot fracture, they were less likely to be physically active (62.3% compared with 67.8%), and they were more likely to have had a previous fracture after the age of fifty (45.5% compared with 36.8%) and to be using either long or short-acting benzodiazepines.",

    "129": "We hypothesized that the mouse liver tumor response to non-genotoxic carcinogens would involve some common early gene and protein expression changes that could ultimately be used to predict chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. In order to identify a panel of genes to test, we analyzed global differences in gene and protein expression in livers from B6C3F1 mice following dietary treatment with two rodent carcinogens, the benzodiazepine anti-anxiety drug oxazepam (2500 p.p.m.) and the hypolipidemic agent Wyeth (Wy)-14,643 (500 p.p.m.) compared with livers from untreated mice. Male mice were exposed for 2 weeks and 1, 3 or 6 months to oxazepam or Wy-14,643 in an age-matched study design. By histopathological evaluation, no liver preneoplastic foci or tumors were detected at 6 months in treated or control groups. By cDNA microarray analysis [NIEHS Mouse Chip (8700 genes); n = 3 individual livers/group, four hybridizations/sample], expression of 36 genes or 220 genes were changed relative to control livers following 6 months of oxazepam or Wy-14,643 treatment, respectively. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of gene/protein expression changes, we also conducted a proteomics study by 2D-gel electrophoresis followed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry on cytoplasmic, nuclear, and microsomal subcellular fractions of the same liver samples utilized for the cDNA microarray analysis. Real-time PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were utilized for validation and to expand the results to other time points. Cyp2b20, growth arrest- and damage-inducible gene beta (Gadd45beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (Igfbp5) genes and proteins were upregulated by oxazepam, and Cyp2b20, Cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Igfbp5, Gadd45beta and cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha subunit-like effector A exhibited higher expression after Wy-14,643 treatment. Most of these genes/proteins were also deregulated at 2 weeks. There appeared to be more distinct than common changes in the expression of carcinogenesis-related genes/proteins between the two compounds, suggesting that the major carcinogenic pathways are different for these compounds and may be distinct for different chemical classes.", 
    "130": "Effect of flurazepam (water-soluble benzodiazepine) on the amplitude and time course of ERG waves was investigated in superfused frog eyecups (Rana ridibunda). Flurazepam (50 and 100 microM) had inhibitory effect on the b- and d-wave amplitude, which was not accompanied with significant changes in their implicit time. Flurazepam potentiated the depressant effect of GABA (2.5 and 5 mM) on the b- and d-wave amplitude. The inhibitory effect of flurazepam was not blocked by 50 microM bicuculline (BCC), (GABA(A) antagonist), although the blocker markedly potentiated the b- and d-wave amplitude. The suppressive effect of flurazepam on the b- but not d-wave amplitude was blocked by 100 microM BCC. Our results indicate existence of functional benzodiazepine regulatory sites on GABA(A) receptors in distal frog retina.", 
    "131": "Administration of olanzapine, an antipsychotic drug, can dose-dependently increase the levels of progesterone's metabolite, 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP) in the brain, which may have anxiolytic effects. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of olanzapine administration on anxiety behavior and progestin levels. Ovariectomized (ovx) rats (N=33) were administered olanzapine (i.p.: 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline buffered with acetic acid) and an hour later were tested for motor and anxiety behavior (n=8 per group) or had tissue collected for measurement of progestin concentrations (n=3 per group). Rats that were administered 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg of olanzapine spent less time freezing in response to shock in the defensive burying task, spent more time on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, and spent more time in social interaction with a conspecific than did vehicle-administered rats. Olanzapine (5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased plasma and produced non-significant increases in whole brain concentrations of progesterone and 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP compared to that seen following vehicle administration. Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that olanzapine reduces fear, has anxiolytic effects, and may enhance social interaction in part due to increasing progestin concentrations.",

DE most commonly occurs within the first 24-48 hours of chemotherapy administration and can persist for 2-5 days. Olanzapine, which has been used anecdotally for chronic nausea in advanced cancer patients, might be a useful treatment for the prevention of delayed emesis in chemotherapy patients. We conducted a chart review to explore this hypothesis and to plan potential studies. Using pharmacy records or an electronic medical record, we identified all patients who had received olanzapine in the oncology clinic (n = 98). We reviewed these records and selected all patients (n = 28) who had received olanzapine for the prevention of delayed emesis for structured review. There were 17 women (60.7%) and 11 men (39.3%). Eleven patients (39.3%) had at least one instance of nausea recorded while undergoing olanzapine treatment and seven (25%) had an episode of vomiting recorded. During 95 total cycles of chemotherapy with olanzapine (mean = 3.4 cycles per patient), there were 21 incidents of nausea (22.1%) and 10 instances of vomiting (10.5%). Side effects were rarely noted. These data suggest that olanzapine was well tolerated and may reduce the incidence of delayed emesis in patients receiving moderate to highly emetogenic chemotherapy. A series of prospective trials are underway.", 
    "133": "Classical in vitro and in vivo models and electrophysiological techniques were used to investigate the role of AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors in various components of spinal segmental reflex potentials. In the rat hemisected spinal cord preparation, the AMPA antagonists NBQX and GYKI 52466 abolished the monosynaptic reflex (MSR) potential but caused only partial inhibition of the motoneuronal population EPSP. NMDA antagonists had no noticeable effect on the MSR in normal medium, but markedly depressed the late part of EPSP. However, an NMDA receptor antagonist sensitive monosynaptic response was recorded in magnesium-free medium at complete blockade of the AMPA receptors. In spinalized rats, the AMPA antagonists completely blocked all components of the dorsal root stimulation evoked potential. MK-801 (2mg/kg, i.v.) reduced monosynaptic responses in a frequency dependent way, with no effect at 0.03 Hz and 22% inhibition at 0.25 Hz. The reduction of the di- and polysynaptic reflex components was about 30% and did not depend on stimulation frequency. Long-latency reflex discharge responses, especially when evoked by train stimulation, were more sensitive to MK-801 than the polysynaptic reflex. These results suggest that glutamate activates MSR pathways through AMPA receptors. However, under certain conditions, NMDA receptors can modulate this transmission through plastic changes in the underlying neuronal circuits. AMPA and NMDA receptors play comparable roles in the mediation of longer latency reflex components.", 
    "134": "Knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying the development of benzodiazepine (BZ) dependence remains incomplete. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor, being the main locus of BZ action, has been the main focus to date in studies performed to elucidate the neuroadaptive processes underlying BZ tolerance and withdrawal in preclinical studies. Despite this intensive effort, however, no clear consensus has been reached on the exact contribution of neuroadaptive processes at the level of the GABA(A) receptor to the development of BZ tolerance and withdrawal. It is likely that changes at the level of this receptor are inadequate in themselves as an explanation of these neuroadaptive processes and that neuroadaptations in other receptor systems are important in the development of BZ dependence. In particular, it has been hypothesised that as part of compensatory mechanisms to diazepam-induced chronic enhancement of GABAergic inhibition, excitatory mechanisms (including the glutamatergic system) become more sensitive [Behav. Pharmacol. 6 (1995) 425], conceivably contributing to BZ tolerance development and/or expression of withdrawal symptoms on cessation of treatment, including increased anxiety and seizure activity. Glutamate is a key candidate for changes in excitatory transmission mechanisms and BZ dependence, (1) since there are defined neuroanatomical relationships between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the CNS and (2) because of the pivotal role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in mediating many forms of synaptic plasticity in the CNS, such as long-term potentiation and kindling events. Thus, it is highly possible that glutamatergic processes are also involved in the neuroadaptive processes in drug dependence, which can conceivably be considered as a form of synaptic plasticity. This review provides an overview of studies investigating changes in the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in the brain associated with BZ dependence, with particular attention to the possible differential involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors in these processes.", 
    "135": "Schizophrenic patients often complain of intellectual functioning impairment. The aim of this survey was to define the subjective memory loss by means of objective tests. The tests were carried out in three steps: before the admission to the clinic, after 6 weeks of hospitalisation, and after approximately 12 months from the beginning of the olanzapine treatment, 36 patients were examined (9 female, 27 male) aged 20-53 (X = 25.4). The following tests were applied: PANSS, Memory Questionnaire (Squire, Zouzounis 1988), subscales: Digit span and Similarities of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, subtest for Long-term memory of the Choynowski's Memory Scale, Diagnosis of Brain Damages (Weidlich, Lamberti), Clock Completion Test, Decroly Box. The subjective assessment of memory functioning improved during the treatment with olanzapine. Before the hospitalisation and after 6 weeks of treatment patients' memory complaints were associated with the visuospatial memory. After 12 month of the olanzapine therapy the memory complaints were associated with audioverbal memory. Age, level of education and objective intensity of psychopathological symptoms did not influence patients' subjective assessment of memory functioning.", 
    "136": "The aim of this study was to assess whether olanzapine treatment results in an improvement of cognitive functions that became impaired by the schizophrenic process.", 
    "137": "The correlation of the intensity of schizophrenic symptoms and duration of the disease with the level of cognitive functions were also examined. The schizophrenic patients were examined in three steps: before beginning of olanzapine treatment, after 6 weeks of treatment, and after approximately 12 months since the beginning of the olanzapine treatment, 36 patients were examined (9 female, 27 male) aged 20-53 (X = 25.4). The following tests were applied: Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale--PANSS, Squire's Memory Questionnaire, sub-scales: Digit span and Similarities of the Wechsler's Intelligence Scale, Long-term memory sub-test of the Choynowski's Memory Scale, Diagnosis of Brain Damages, Clock Completion Test, Decroly's Box.", 
    "138": "The olanzapine treatment of schizophrenia was characterised by significant antipsychotic efficacy including both positive and negative symptoms. The positive symptoms were associated with the attention range, the planning process context and the immediate memory with the tendency towards loosing remembrance in the process of non-verbal learning. The negative symptoms were associated with concrete conceptual thinking. Improvement of cognitive functions was noted for almost all of the examined functions. The effect of olanzapine therapy in schizophrenic patients may be regarded as personality integrating.", 
    "139": "Early stress is associated with long-term alterations in brain circuits and systems that mediate the stress response. Early stressors have lasting effects on the HPA axis and norepinephrine systems. Other brain systems that are involved include benzodiazepine, opiate, dopaminergic, and various neuropeptide systems. These neurochemical systems modulate function in brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Long-term alterations in these brain regions are hypothesized to play a role in the maintenance of PTSD, depression, and other psychiatric symptoms after childhood abuse.",

    "141": "Alcohol consumption is more frequent in men than in women; 9% of the geriatric patients (3% of women and 18% of men) show symptoms of alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is also associated with benzodiazepine treatment and nicotine dependence.", 
    "142": "Elderly male patients hospitalized in the geriatric unit and receiving benzodiazepines should thus be identified as a population at risk for alcohol dependence, and medical practitioners should be alert to the possibility of overprescribing benzodiazepines past the acute withdrawal stage.", 
    "143": "The influence of the viral protease inhibitor lopinavir on the activity of six human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes was evaluated in a model system using human liver microsomes. Column chromatography methodology was developed to separate lopinavir from ritonavir starting from the commercially available lopinavir-ritonavir combination dosage form. Lopinavir produced negligible or weak inhibition of human CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6. However, lopinavir was an inhibitor of CYP3A. At 250 microM triazolam (the CYP3A index substrate), the mean (+/- s.e., n = 4) IC50 versus triazolam alpha-hydroxylation (where IC50 is the concentration producing a 50% decrement in reaction velocity) was 7.3 (+/- 0.5) microM. Pre-incubation of lopinavir with microsomes prior to addition of triazolam yielded a significantly lower IC50 of 4.1 (+/- 0.5) microM. This is consistent with mechanism-based inhibition of human CYP3A by lopinavir. Although lopinavir is less potent than ritonavir as an inhibitor of CYP3A, lopinavir is nonetheless likely to contribute to net CYP3A inhibition in-vivo during treatment with the lopinavir-ritonavir combination.", 
    "144": "The energies and physical descriptors for the binding of 20 novel 1-(2,6-difluorobenzyl)-2-(2,6-difluorophenyl)benzimidazole analogues (BPBIs) to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) have been determined using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The crystallographic structure of the lead compound, 1-(2,6-difluorobenzyl)-2-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-4-methylbenzimidazole, was used as a starting point to model the inhibitors in both the bound and the unbound states. The energy terms and physical descriptors obtained from the calculations were correlated with their respective experimental EC(50) values, resulting in an r(2) value of 0.70 and a root-mean-square deviation (rms) of 0.53 kcal/mol. The terms in the correlation include the change in total Coulombic energy and solvent-accessible surface area. Structural analysis of the data files from the BPBI calculations reveals that all of the analogues with good biological activity show the formation of a hydrogen bond between the ligand and the backbone nitrogen atom of lysine 103. By use of the structural results, two novel BPBI inhibitors have been designed and calculations have been carried out. The results show the formation of the desired hydrogen bonds, and the DeltaG(binding) values predict the compounds to be excellent RT inhibitors. Subsequent synthesis and biological activity testing of these analogues have shown the validity of the predictive calculations. If the BPBIs are modeled in a site constructed from the crystal coordinates of a member of another class of nonnucleoside inhibitors (the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepine-2(1H)-thione and -one (TIBO) compounds), the correlation with the same terms drops slightly, giving an r(2) value of 0.61 with an associated root-mean-square value of 0.53 kcal/mol. Conversely, if the TIBO compounds are modeled in a site constructed from the BPBI complex crystal coordinates, a correlation can be obtained using the drug-protein interaction energy and change in the total number of hydrogen bonds, giving an r(2) value of 0.63. These are the same descriptors that were used for the TIBO compounds modeled in their own sites, where the r(2) value was 0.72. These data suggest that it may be possible, in some cases, to design novel inhibitors utilizing structural data from related, but not identical, inhibitors.", 
    "145": "Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have been associated with several inflammatory diseases, and therefore, strategies for its suppression have become important targets in drug discovery. Our efforts to suppress TNF-alpha have centered on the inhibition of TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) through the use of hydroxamate inhibitors. Starting from broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, we have designed and synthesized novel benzothiadiazepines as potent and selective TACE inhibitors. The benzothiadiazepines were synthesized with variation in P1 and P1' in order to effect potency and selectivity. The inhibitors were evaluated versus porcine TACE (pTACE), and the initial selectivity was assessed with counterscreens of MMP-1, -2, and -9. Several potent and selective inhibitors were discovered with compound 41 being the most active against pTACE (K(i) = 5 nM) while still maintaining good selectivity versus the MMP's (at least 75-fold). Most compounds were assessed in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay (PBMC) and the human whole blood assay (WBA) to determine their ability to suppress TNF-alpha. Compound 32 was the most potent compound in the PBMC assay (IC(50) = 0.35 microM), while compound 62 was the most active in the WBA (IC(50) = 1.4 microM).", 
    "146": "Antagonism of the bradykinin B(1) receptor was demonstrated to be a potential treatment for chronic pain and inflammation. Novel benzodiazepines were designed that display subnanomolar affinity for the bradykinin B(1) receptor (K(i) = 0.59 nM) and high selectivity against the bradykinin B(2) receptor (K(i) > 10 microM). In vivo efficacy, comparable to morphine, was demonstrated for lead compounds in a rodent hyperalgesia model.", 
    "147": "We investigated the effects of diazepam (DZP) and its three metabolites: nordiazepam (NZP), oxazepam (OZP), and temazepam (TZP) on pineal gland nocturnal melatonin secretion. We looked at the effects of benzodiazepines on pineal gland melatonin secretion both in vitro (using organ perifusion) and in vivo in male Wistar rats sacrificed in the middle of the dark phase. We also examined the effects of these benzodiazepines on in vivo melatonin secretion in the Harderian glands. Neither DZP (10(-5)-10(-6)M) nor its metabolites (10(-4)-10(-5)M) affected melatonin secretion by perifused rat pineal glands in vitro. In contrast, a 10(-4)M suprapharmacological concentration of DZP increased melatonin secretion of perifused pineal glands by 70%. In vivo, a single acute subcutaneous administration of DZP (3 mg/kg body weight) significantly affected pineal melatonin synthesis and plasma melatonin levels, while administration of the metabolites under the same conditions did not. DZP reduced pineal melatonin content (-40%), N-acetyltransferase activity (-70%), and plasma melatonin levels (-40%), but had no affects on pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity. Neither DZP nor its metabolites affected Harderian gland melatonin content. Our results indicate that the in vivo inhibitory effect of DZP on melatonin synthesis is not due to the metabolism of DZP. The results also show that the control of melatonin production in the Harderian glands differ from that observed in the pineal gland.", 
    "148": "Loss of function, muscle inflammation, and pain are some of the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD). Pharmacological strategies to minimize the clinical manifestation of these disorders often focus on blocking or inhibiting the pain-causing symptom. Resources such as muscle-relaxants, anxiety-relief drugs, and splint therapy are often used to reduce muscular hyperactivity related to TMD muscle pain. This study compares the effect of a randomly ordered association of occlusal splint therapy (S), nonsteroid anti-inflammatory with a muscle-relaxant drug (orphenadrine citrate) (O), and an anxiety-relief drug (benzodiazepine) (B), to ease painful TMD muscle symptoms. Clinical and anamnestic analyses were recorded in accordance with the Helkimo TMD index and applied before and after treatments. Twenty-one group two Helkimo TMD adult female patients were treated, all of whom were subjected to the three random therapeutic associations proposed: SBO, BOS, and OSB. The same operator applied the three specific associations over a period of 21 days in the proposed sequence, seven days for each therapy. The results show that all the groups presented the best results in terms of relief from pain after the therapeutic association (28.5% showed a decrease and 47.6% showed an absence of symptoms). No significant difference was observed among association therapeutic protocols.",

    "150": "Twenty-four children, aged 19 to 65 months, with a diagnosis of mild to moderate asthma were given an oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg of midazolam. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and pulse rate were monitored before, during, immediately after, and 30 minutes following dental treatment. The child's asthma score was also determined before and after treatment. The dental operator assessed the overall sedation outcome immediately after treatment.", 
    "151": "Twenty-three of the 24 subjects had asthma scores of \"0\" before and after treatment. During dental treatment, 2 patients had oxygen saturations of 94% at one point during treatment. However, oxygen saturation increased when the patient's head and neck were repositioned. Twenty-three of the 24 subjects had oxygen saturations above 95% at 30 minutes following treatment. Pulse rates and respiratory rates exhibited transitory increases, linked to when the child was stimulated. Statistical analysis was conducted from within subjects repeated measures via ANOVA and with a general linear model approach. No statistically significant differences occurred in oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. However, significant differences did occur in pulse rate between 5 and 10 minutes (mean difference=10+/-3.84) and between 10 and 15 minutes (mean difference=19+/-5.50), as expected. No statistically significant differences occurred in asthma score before and after treatment. Twelve subjects were assessed to have excellent behavior, 5 subjects were satisfactory, and 7 subjects were unsatisfactory. No treatment was aborted.",

    "153": "The cardiorespiratory effects, effectiveness, and reversibility of two injectable anesthetic combinations were compared in captive patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). Seven patas monkeys were hand-injected with medetomidine (40 microg/kg, i.m.), butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg. i.m.), and ketamine (3.0 mg/kg. i.m.), and seven were injected with the same dosages of medetomidine and butorphanol plus midazolam (0.3 mg/kg, i.m.). Heart rates decreased in monkeys in both treatment groups and were lower than those previously recorded in patas monkeys anesthetized with either ketamine or ketamine and isoflurane. Mean arterial pressures were highest in ketamine-treated monkeys but remained within normal limits for both groups. End tidal CO2 values increased gradually over time in both groups and were above physiologic norms after 20 min. Respiratory rates were similar between groups and remained constant throughout the procedures. Despite adequate ventilation parameters, initial low percent oxygen-hemoglobin saturation (SpO2) values were suggestive of severe hypoxemia. It was not clear whether these were accurate readings or an artifact of medetomidine-induced peripheral vasoconstriction. Oxygen supplementation restored SpO2 values to normal (>94%) in both groups. Both combinations effectively produced a state of light anesthesia, although spontaneous recoveries occurred after 30 min in three ketamine-treated monkeys. All monkeys were given i.m. atipamezole (0.2 mg/kg) and naloxone (0.02 mg/kg), whereas midazolam-treated monkeys also received flumazenil (0.02 mg/kg, i.v.), which resulted in faster (median recovery time = 5 min) and more complete recoveries in this group. Both combinations are safe to use when supplemented with oxygen, although the midazolam combination provided a longer anesthetic period and was more fully reversible.", 
    "154": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) constitute the most widely used symptomatic treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Many of these drugs are associated with adverse effects, such as daytime sedation and dependence with continued use. There is a concern about the rationale for and extent of benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the elderly. The sedation due to BZD use is a main risk factor for falls and other accidents. Impaired cognitive function with continuous use appears to be a major side effect. There is a general awareness that BZD use is inappropriate in many patients, and therefore discontinuation should be recommended whenever possible. Moreover, long-term use of these drugs should be actively discouraged. Although no unanimous recommendations concerning the optimal duration of the withdrawal process exist, BZDs may easily be withdrawn during a short period in most patients who are habituated to a low dose, if an initial phase with dose reduction and psychological support are provided. Alternative approaches involve sleep hygiene guidelines, behavioural treatment and psychotherapy tailored to the needs of the individual patient.", 
    "155": "Stimulation of a neural pathway originating in the brainstem reticular formation, with synapses in the medial hypothalamus, activates the hippocampal theta rhythm. The frequency of reticular-elicited theta is determined in the medial supramammillary nucleus (mSuM) completely in anaesthetised rats, but only partially when the animal is awake. We tested other medial hypothalamic sites for their capacity to control theta frequency in awake rats. Blockade of sodium channels (1 microl fast infusion of the local anaesthetic procaine, experiment 1) or increased inhibition by GABA (Chlordiazepoxide [CDP], experiment 2) was found to reduce or increase the frequency of reticular-elicited theta, depending on the precise site of injection, in the region of the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) and the posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PH). A band of null sites for CDP was located in the region of the ventral border of PH and dorsal border of mSuM. Using 0.5 and 1 microl CDP, and slow infusions (experiment 3), it was found that effective PH sites were also separate from mSuM in the rostrocaudal direction. In experiment 4, the DMH/PH region was mapped with unilateral and bilateral slow infusions of 0.5 microl CDP. CDP significantly reduced frequency in medial (periventricular) and dorsal PH, but not DMH. Bilateral injections appeared to generally sum the usual effects of unilateral injection, producing effects of intermediate size. However, the absolute frequency change in any given site, or with any pair of sites, did not exceed 1 Hz, which is similar to what is seen with single injections in mSuM. Overall, it appears that at, any one time, theta frequency may be determined by a complex interplay between distinct but interacting modulatory regions in the medial hypothalamus.",

They appear to have added benefit for treating negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and hence can enhance the quality of life of some patients. The choice of particular agents for individual patients requires a balancing of efficacy and side effects. Medication is only one element of what should be an individualised comprehensive treatment plan for people with schizophrenia."
