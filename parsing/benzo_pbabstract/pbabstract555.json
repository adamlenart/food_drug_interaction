    "0": "There is a growing appreciation of the heterogeneity of alcoholic patients with implications for treatment intervention. Several recent studies suggest that a minority of alcoholic patients suffer from diagnosable anxiety disorders, although symptoms of anxiety may be present in alcoholics while drinking and in the acute, subacute and protracted periods of abstinence from alcohol. In addition, recent research on biological mechanisms of anxiety may suggest a testable model for examining the existence of an altered biological state associated with symptoms of protracted abstinence in alcoholics, and may suggest an additional rationale for studying newer anxiolytic drugs in the postwithdrawal management of alcoholic patients. In the mid-1970s, Benjamin Kissin made three points regarding the optimal qualities for a tranquilizing drug in the treatment of alcoholism: it should be effective in maintaining individuals in treatment, it should have a low potential for abuse and it should not potentiate the effects of alcohol. Buspirone, a new anxiolytic drug, fulfills the second two criteria. The case for examining anxiolytics with low abuse potential in alcoholic patients is reviewed.", 
    "1": "Zopiclone is the first of the cyclopyrrolones, a new class of psychotherapeutic agents possessing a pharmacological profile of high efficacy and low toxicity similar to that of the benzodiazepines. Binding is thought to occur to the benzodiazepine receptor complex, or to a site closely linked to this complex. Although zopiclone exhibits anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and anxiolytic properties in animals, it finds better use as an hypnotic because of marked sedating effects. In clinical trials, zopiclone (usually 7.5 mg) improved sleep in chronic insomniacs similarly to nitrazepam 5 mg, flurazepam 15 to 30 mg, triazolam 0.5 mg and temazepam 20 mg, but in a single study was slightly less effective than flunitrazepam 2 mg in some evaluation criteria. Sleep induction before surgical procedures in hospitalised patients is satisfactory with zopiclone, but when the drugs are administered a few hours before surgery, diazepam appears to be more effective in alleviating preoperative anxiety. Minimal impairment of psychomotor skills and mental acuity occurs in the morning after a bedtime dose of zopiclone, which has a short half-life of about 5 hours and no long acting metabolites. No serious side effects have been reported in the relatively small number of patients studied to date; the development of 'bitter taste' does not deter patients from continuing therapy. Thus, with its short duration of action zopiclone is a useful alternative to other hypnotics, especially in patients intolerant of residual effects the morning after taking an hypnotic.", 
    "2": "Physical dependence to sedative/hypnotic drugs is not an uncommon clinical problem. The withdrawal syndrome is analogous to alcohol withdrawal, except the duration of the syndrome occurs over a longer period of time with the symptoms being less intense than generally encountered with alcohol. The potential for withdrawal reactions is probably greater for the shorter-acting agents than the longer-acting drugs. Potentially dependent sedative/hypnotic users require stabilization of their symptoms initially, followed by tolerance testing. If tolerant, the patients should be withdrawn using either a long-acting sedative/hypnotic (e.g., diazepam) or phenobarbital. Compared to other benzodiazepines and barbiturates, diazepam appears to be the drug of choice for treating dependent patients. Diazepam is rapidly absorbed and distributed to the brain and therefore useful for stabilization and tolerance testing. It is metabolized on chronic administration to a long-acting metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which makes the drug ideal for a tapered withdrawal schedule.", 
    "3": "Liver oxidative metabolism, assessed by debrisoquine hydroxylation test, was studied in 107 healthy volunteers and in 71 patients with or without neuroleptic drug treatment. The mean metabolic ratio (MR = debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine excretion in the urine) was 2.8 +/- 0.1 (s.e. mean) in the control group, six persons being poor metabolizers of debrisoquine (MR greater than or equal to 12.6). The mean MR (12.1 +/- 1.5) was significantly higher in those 42 patients taking neuroleptics than in patients without neuroleptics (0.8 +/- 0.1). In the former group, seventeen patients had a MR exceeding 12.6. Oral contraceptives, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines and progestin derivates did not increase MR values, the highest individual ratio being 2.72 in those subjects not receiving neuroleptics. These results suggest a probable competitive inhibition of oxidative metabolism by neuroleptics. This is a phenomenon of potential clinical importance both in patients with an inherited poor metabolic capacity and in patients receiving other drugs like beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and tricyclic antidepressants oxidized by the same enzyme system.", 
    "4": "Studies on the inhibition of ciramadol glucuronidation by benzodiazepines were performed in vitro and in vivo. Ciramadol glucuronidation was slower (Vmax, 1.56 vs. 5.40 nmol/min/mg of microsomal protein) in human than in dog liver microsomes. Inhibition constants (Ki) for lorazepam and oxazepam were 3 to 4 times higher than that calculated for diazepam. Rates of morphine glucuronidation in human liver microsomes were assessed for comparative purposes and agreed with literature values. Each benzodiazepine appeared to be a competitive inhibitor of ciramadol and morphine UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity. The in vivo disposition of ciramadol was unchanged in dogs pretreated with lorazepam. After diazepam treatment no change in the Vdss of ciramadol occurred, but plasma clearance was significantly reduced, resulting in a prolongation of t1/2. Diazepam caused a significant reduction in the oral clearance of ciramadol, whereas no change occurred in systemic availability. Thus, diazepam may have had a secondary effect on hepatic blood flow (QH) and produced offsetting alterations in both intrinsic clearance (Cl int) and QH. A decrease in the area under the plasma concentration time curves of ciramadol aryl O-glucuronide following iv treatment with diazepam coupled with the in vitro data indicate that the mechanism for the decrease in the clearance of ciramadol is inhibition of its glucuronidation by diazepam. Since glucuronidation plays a major role in the elimination of ciramadol in man and dog, these experiments suggest that the disposition of ciramadol in man would not be affected by coadministration of lorazepam, whereas the potential for a diazepam/ciramadol drug interaction in humans exists.", 
    "5": "Phenazepam (5 mg/200 g) and seduxen (3 mg/200 g) injected intraperitoneally to 184 rats altered AMP-deaminase and adenosine deaminase brain activity. Seduxen was observed to increase AMP-deaminase and adenosine deaminase activity by 89.1% and 32.4%, respectively an hour after the injection. Phenazepam increased the activity of the enzymes by 35.5% and 38.5%, respectively two hours after the injection. The effect is suggested to be due to de novo benzodiazepine-induced enzyme synthesis.", 
    "6": "The efficacy and safety of estazolam, an investigational triazolobenzodiazepine, and flurazepam were compared in 65 insomniac outpatients. Patients completed sleep questionnaires each morning. Global evaluations demonstrated that both treatments were significantly superior to placebo. However, estazolam was preferred over flurazepam in a global rating that reflected how well rested and refreshed the subjects felt on arising. Improvement in complaints of difficulty in going to sleep showed only a trend toward significance favoring estazolam and flurazepam over placebo. Residual daytime drowsiness and fatigue accounted for approximately 70% of all side effects with both active treatments. Significantly more side effects occurred with flurazepam than with estazolam. Flurazepam-treated patients had a significantly more severe rating of adverse reactions than did placebo-treated patients.", 
    "7": "Ninety-eight outpatients with major depressive disorder were treated with alprazolam, imipramine, or placebo in a 6-week, double-blind study. Average doses were 3.67 mg of alprazolam and 167 mg of imipramine, given at bedtime. Fifty percent of patients taking alprazolam, 38.2% taking imipramine, and 17.7% receiving placebo improved their HAM-D scores by more than 50%. Eight patients on imipramine, 6 on alprazolam, and 1 on placebo dropped out because of side effects. The most common side effects for imipramine were tachycardia, constipation, light-headedness, and sedation; common side effects of alprazolam were light-headedness, sedation, and unsteadiness.", 
    "8": "A frequent requisite to urgent dental care is the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents as part of the treatment protocol. Anxiolytics, anesthetics, analgesics, and antibiotics are prescribed as dictated by particular clinical situations.", 
    "9": "The inhibitory effect of omeprazole, a benzimidazole derivative, on gastric acid secretion was investigated in seven patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome resistant to treatment with large doses of histamine H2-receptor antagonists administered alone or in combination with pirenzepine. In two patients with an acute form of the syndrome, rapid control of acid overproduction was achieved with 180-mg intravenous and 120-mg oral daily doses, respectively. The other five patients, who were free of complication, initially received a standard regimen of omeprazole 60 mg orally once a day; dosage was subsequently adjusted until the basal acid output, measured 1 hr before the next dose of the drug, was less than 10 mmol/hr. The initial daily dose proved to be adequate in three patients and had to be increased to 80 mg and 60 mg bid, respectively in the remaining two patients. In all patients omeprazole therapy resulted in clinical recovery and rapid healing of mucosal lesions. The seven patients have now been followed up for 4-24 months (average 15 months). The adequacy of the daily dosage was periodically reassessed by measuring basal acid output in the hour preceding the morning dose. In one patient initially treated with 180 mg/day, dosage could be reduced to 60 mg/day. In three others, who were initially controlled with 60 mg/day, dosage had to be increased during follow-up. Despite adequate control of gastric acid secretion, one patient underwent total gastrectomy and tumor resection and another died of extensive liver metastases. The five patients still receiving omeprazole remain free of symptoms and mucosal lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The effectiveness of clonidine hydrochloride in the treatment of abrupt withdrawal from long-term, therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines was studied in three patients under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions. The intensity, severity, and duration of the abstinence syndrome were not altered by clonidine at a dose sufficient to markedly reduce blood pressure and plasma free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol. These results contrast with the established efficacy of clonidine in the opiate withdrawal syndrome and suggest that many of the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal may not be caused by hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system.", 
    "11": "We compared the effects of PK 11195, an antagonist of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, on contractions of rabbit aorta by activation of either voltage-operated calcium channels (VOC) using BAY K 8644 (a calcium \"agonist\") and KCl or receptor-operated channels (ROC) using phenylephrine and B-HT 920, (alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, respectively). In partially depolarized muscle strips, BAY K 8644 induced contractions that were noncompetitively inhibited by PK 11195 (pD'2 = 5.6 +/- 0.15). The effect of this calcium agonist was also antagonized by nitrendipine (competitively) and by yohimbine (noncompetitively), while prazosin was inactive. Contractions induced by KCl were inhibited by nitrendipine and, weakly, by PK 11195. Contractions induced by phenylephrine and B-HT 920 were inhibited competitively by prazosin and yohimbine and noncompetitively by nitrendipine, while PK 11195 was ineffective. It is concluded that PK 11195 behaves as an antagonist of VOC activated by BAY K 8644 and to a lesser extent by KCl depolarization but not of ROC coupled to alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors.", 
    "12": "The analysis of drugs of abuse in urine is a valuable tool for the detection of illicit drug use and the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts. In order for the results to be conclusive, however, several precautions have to be taken during the collection, storage, mailing and analysis of the urinary specimen. Since immunological methods for the determination of drugs of abuse are not completely specific, all positive results on immunoassay should be confirmed, at least for forensic purposes, by a chromatographic technique. Although much more complicated and time-consuming, some chromatographic techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry offer the possibility of unambiguously identifying drugs of abuse. However, in some cases, even with this method it is not possible to decide whether the identified metabolite of a drug of abuse stems from food or illicit or elicit drug use. A single urinary analysis is, therefore, sometimes not sufficient to provide unambiguous proof of the use of illicit drugs. However, definite evidence of repeated drug abuse can be obtained if the person involved is carefully instructed as to which medicines or food must not be taken during the investigation period and yet the analysis of several urinary specimens taken at intervals of one or two days proves positive.", 
    "13": "Intracerebral microinjection of the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, into the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, induced a profound behavioral syndrome consisting of repetitive, stereotyped forepaw treading in an upright posture. Electroencephalographic analysis revealed multiple bursts of sharp waves, 200-300 microV, accompanying the carbachol-elicited motor behavior. Pretreatment with intraperitoneal doses of three anticonvulsant drugs, clonazepam, diazepam, and pentobarbital, blocked the manifestation of the motor behavior. These observations suggest that activation of cholinergically innervated regions of the rat medial prefrontal cortex induces an atypical form of seizures.", 
    "14": "Stimulation of cholinergic fibers or bath application of carbachol (0.1-10 microM) induced a slow excitability increase in CA3 neurons and dentate granule cells of hippocampal slices. This effect which was antagonized by atropine (1 microM) was mediated by two receptor subtypes: a pirenzepine (10 microM)-insensitive receptor, 'M2', and a pirenzepine (1 microM)-sensitive receptor, 'M1'. The M2-receptor activation led to a blockade of slow afterhyperpolarizations following trains of action potentials and to the occurrence of threshold-activated plateau-depolarizations associated with a conductance increase. The M1-receptor mediated a membrane depolarization sometimes associated with a conductance decrease which reversed its polarity at membrane potentials negative to -80 mV. The 'slow excitatory postsynaptic potential' which results from activation of cholinergic fibers is thus caused by the activation of two receptor subtypes.", 
    "15": "Microiontophoretic ejection of 3 benzodiazepines (BZDs), flurazepam, diazepam and midazolam, and of Ro 15-1788 to primary somatosensory cortical neurons altered the nature of the responses evoked by natural stimulation of the cutaneous surface. BZDs raised the thresholds to tactile stimulation and produced a decrease of the receptive field areas of neurons situated in rapidly adapting submodality regions of S1 cortex; these effects of the BZDs were exerted at different apparent potencies. Ro 15-1788 antagonized the BZD-induced receptive field size decreases and threshold changes. When administered alone, this substance sometimes lowered the threshold for tactile activation and slightly enlarged the receptive field size.", 
    "16": "The interpretation of the dexamethasone suppression test in endocrinology and psychiatry depends on several variables. False-positive results can be caused by stress, weight loss, alcohol withdrawal, treatment with diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin, carbamazepine and lithium. Therapy with spironolactone, naloxone, alpha 1-mimetic agents and estrogen can be responsible for an increase in plasma-cortisol concentration. False-negative results are seen in patients with liver disease and can also result from therapy with benzodiazepines at high dosages, indomethacin and possibly methadone and ketoconazole.", 
    "17": "We have examined the laminar distributions of eight types of receptor in the primary visual cortex (area 17) and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the macaque monkey. The receptor populations and subpopulations examined included those selective for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (using [3H]-muscimol as ligand), L-glutamate-related receptors (using [3H]-L-glutamate and [3H]-AMPA), muscarinic acetylcholine (using [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate--QNB and [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine--NMS), cholecystokinin (CCK) (using [3H] pentagastrin), benzodiazepine (using [3H]-flunitrazepam), and adenosine (using [3H]-cyclohexyladenosine--CHA). Each of the receptors examined exhibited characteristic and differing laminar patterns of binding in the striate cortex. Perhaps reflecting the high density of cell bodies and synapses in layer 4C, most receptors, except those labelled by [3H]-L-glutamate or [3H]-AMPA, showed dense concentrations in this layer. Layers 4B and 5, which contain relatively few cell bodies and heavy myelin concentrations, were in general lightly labelled. Layer 6 showed relatively heavy labelling when [3H]-AMPA (quisqualate) or [3H]-pentagastrin (CCK) were used as ligands. The superficial layers of the cortex were zones of relative concentration of GABA, benzodiazepine, acetylcholine, glutamate-related, and adenosine receptors. In general, the binding patterns resembled those previously described for cat visual cortex, but there were also some clear differences. The distributions of all of these receptors likely reflect the differential input substances to different laminae of the visual cortex. Of the receptors examined, only those for GABA, benzodiazepine, and acetylcholine were found in substantial concentration in the LGN. Of these, GABA and benzodiazepine receptors showed especially dense binding in the magnocellular layers of the LGN compared to the parvicellular layers.", 
    "18": "The problems of long term treatment with antiparkinson drugs are numerous, involving increased involuntary movements, painful dystonic cramps, decrease or loss of therapeutic benefit, wearing-off, episodes of akinesia (on-off) and long periods of \"freezing\". Important side effects are also mental changes with heavy dreams, hallucinations, nocturnal confusional states and paranoid psychosis. As most of these side effects are dose-related, they are postponed and lessened by small daily doses of L-dopa and decarboxylase inhibitor. Frequent small doses may decrease the wearing-off effect but may cause unpredictable episodes of on-off. The addition of or partial replacement by bromocriptine may decrease fluctuations and dyskinesias in many patients. To reduce the side effects such as nausea, orthostatic hypotension and mental disturbances, daily doses of 15-30 mg should be built up very slowly. Painful dystonias are related to the off period and respond well to baclofen. For the treatment of severe psychic disturbances tranquilizers with little or no extrapyramidal side effects, such as clomethiazole, benzodiazepine derivatives and (if necessary) thioridazine, are recommended. Bromocriptine may also be useful in occasional cases which do not, or no longer, respond to L-dopa.", 
    "19": "Rapid changes in the chloride ionophore component of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex were observed in cerebral cortical membranes from rats exposed to a brief, ambient temperature swim stress. These changes were manifest as: an increase in both the efficacy and potency of chloride ions to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding, and an increase in both the number of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (a ligand that binds at or near the GABAA receptor-gated chloride ionophore) binding sites and the apparent affinity of this radioligand. These studies demonstrate that the GABA-gated, benzodiazepine-coupled chloride ionophore, which can be considered the effector component of this 'supramolecular complex', is rapidly modulated by acute stress. Such changes could represent the compensatory response of an organism to stressful or anxiety provoking changes in the environment.", 
    "20": "A novel antimuscarinic agent, pirenzepine, has been proposed to distinguish at least two subtypes of muscarinic receptor. M1 receptors have been designated as those displaying a high affinity for pirenzepine. Both functional and binding studies have revealed a prevalence of M1 receptors in sympathetic ganglia while autonomic effector tissues have only low densities of M1 receptors. In the present study, in vitro autoradiographic procedures have been used to localize specifically high affinity binding sites for pirenzepine (M1 receptors) in sections of guinea-pig ileum, rat superior cervical ganglion and rat submaxillary gland. The overall localization of muscarinic receptors was also studied using the non-selective antagonist, [3H]N-methylscopolamine. The highest densities of M1 receptors were found in superior cervical ganglion, sympathetic nerve bundles, myenteric ganglia and mucous secreting cells of the submaxillary gland, while lower densities were found in smooth muscle and serous secreting cells of the submaxillary gland. No area found to possess muscarinic receptors was devoid of M1 receptors.", 
    "21": "Benzodiazepines are widely used anxiolytics and anticonvulsants, and their potent sedative properties are routinely used in presurgical anaesthesia. However, they are also known to induce a strong anterograde amnesia in patients. Specific benzodiazepine antagonists have recently been described, some of which have intrinsic pharmacological properties that are opposite to those of benzodiazepines. These have been called inverse agonists and they have been shown to be proconvulsant or convulsant whereas benzodiazepines are anticonvulsants. Inverse agonists are also anxiogenic rather than anxiolytic. Since benzodiazepines induce anterograde amnesia, we have investigated the possibility that inverse agonists might also have an opposite effect for this property and so enhance acquisition (learning) and (or) retention (memory). We report here that, in three different animal models, an inverse agonist of the beta-carboline group, methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), enhances animal performance in three different tasks used to investigate learning and memory.", 
    "22": "The distribution of monoamine oxidase inhibitor-benzodiazepine receptor binding inhibitor, extractable into ethyl acetate at pH 1, was examined in a range of rat tissues. Great variation in the activity of both inhibitors was found in the different tissues, the highest being present in superior cervical ganglion, and lowest in adrenal gland. There was a highly significant correlation between the distribution of the two activities in different tissues, supporting the concept that they both derive from the same molecule (tribulin). The level of inhibitory activity in some of the tissues was such that variations might conceivably play a significant role in vivo.", 
    "23": "Antidepressants, given in the correct dosage and for an adequate period of time, are very effective in the treatment of the majority of cases of primary depressive illness. In this review, a rational approach to the pharmacological management of depression is discussed. The relative advantages and problems associated with the various types of antidepressants are reviewed. The role of benzodiazepines in the management of depression is considered.", 
    "24": "In order to elucidate the fundamental differences between alcohol and barbital physical dependence, comparative studies were made on the effect of various drugs on the withdrawal signs developed in alcohol and barbital dependent mice. Ethanol, barbital and diazepam, drugs of alcohol-barbiturate type dependence liability, and ethosuximide, an anticonvulsant, suppressed both withdrawal signs in a dose dependent manner. The effects of these drugs were different from each other only quantitatively and no special difference was observed between the effects on alcohol and barbital withdrawal signs. On the other hand, the effects of phenytoin, an anticonvulsant, and pentylenetetrazol, a convulsant, were only evident in alcohol dependent animals. Phenytoin elicited body tremor and markedly exacerbated the alcohol withdrawal signs, but slightly suppressed the barbital withdrawal signs. Dose-response curves for the convulsive effect of pentylenetetrazol obtained at the peak of the withdrawal signs shifted greatly to the left in alcohol withdrawn animals but less in barbital withdrawn animals. These discrepancies between the effects on alcohol and barbital withdrawal signs may suggest a difference in the underlying mechanisms for the production of alcohol and barbital physical dependence.", 
    "25": "5-[(2-Aminoacetamido)methyl]-1-[p-chloro-2-(o-chlorobenzoyl)phenyl ]-N,N-dimethyl-1 H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride dihydrate (450191-S), a sleep inducer, is a ring-opened derivative of 1,4-benzodiazepine and has been reported to be activated by intestinal aminopeptidases in a step of absorption. In this study, we investigated the role of the intestinal aminopeptidases in the uptake of 450191-S by the intestine by using various aminopeptidase inhibitors in everted sacs of rat small intestine in vitro. Glycylglycine did not affect the desglycylation of 450191-S but glycyl-L-leucine or L-leucyl-L-leucine inhibited the reaction. This inhibition was accompanied by reduced concentration of 450191-S metabolites in the intestinal tissue. When the incubation was carried out at 0 degrees C or with puromycin, the desglycylation was also inhibited and the concentration was similarly reduced. Since the extent of inhibition of the desglycylation of 450191-S was negatively correlated with the total concentration of 450191-S metabolites in the intestinal tissue (r = 0.9660), the aminopeptidases must play an important role in the uptake of 450191-S by the intestine. To confirm this, we examined the uptake of the desglycylated product of 450191-S, 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-4H-1,2,4-triazolo- [1,5-alpha] [1,4]-benzodiazepine-2-carboxamide (M-1) in the same manner. No effect of dipeptides, puromycin or reduced temperature was found on M-1 uptake by the intestine, leading to the conclusion that the aminopeptidases are important for enhancing the uptake of 450191-S in the intestine.", 
    "26": "Plasma melatonin levels were determined every 20 and 30 min for 24 hours on the last day of repeated oral administrations (1 or 2 mg a day for 8 or 9 days) of a benzodiazepine derivative (450191-s), which is known to be metabolized to active benzodiazepines after administration. In one of the two subjects, the nocturnal enhancement of plasma melatonin which was obvious on a control day with placebo was diminished almost completely. In the other subject, observed were not only the diminishment of its nocturnal enhancement but also its increase during the daytime almost to the nocturnal levels on a control day, which may indicate a rebound increase in melatonin synthesis or a shift in its day-night rhythmicity. Such suppressing effects of benzodiazepines on the nocturnal plasma melatonin levels were also examined in the case of a single administration of 2 mg of 450191-s or flunitrazepam in the second series of experiments. Even a single flunitrazepam seemed to have lowered nocturnal plasma melatonin levels, which then recovered to the usual levels following the administration of 5 mg of a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, given 6 hours after the flunitrazepam. However, single 450191-s did not show any remarkable effects. Thus, it has been suggested that benzodiazepines could suppress the nocturnal levels of plasma melatonin or shift its day-night rhythmicity at least when administered repeatedly. The possible action site of benzodiazepines may be the central nervous system, since melatonin synthesis has been though to be under strongly regulated by the central nervous pathway from the retina to the pineal body. Therefore, these effects of benzodiazepines may provide a method for investigating the physiological role of melatonin and its day-night rhythmicity as well as to further clarify the system regulating melatonin synthesis in humans.", 
    "27": "Muscarinic receptors in rabbit aortic membranes were characterized by binding assays using I-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, and compared with muscarinic receptors in dog and bovine aortas. In the rabbit aortic membranes, I-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate specifically bound with high affinity (KD = 28.1 pM) to a single class of sites (maximum number of binding sites = 57.2 fmol/mg of protein) which have characteristics of muscarinic receptors. Drug competition curves indicated a single class of binding sites for antagonists (e.g., K1 = 160 nM for pirenzepine), but suggested the presence of two affinity binding sites (or states) for agonists (e.g., K1 = 8.29 nM and K2 = 0.32 microM for oxotremorine, respectively). I-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate also bound to a single class of sites in the membranes of dog and bovine aortas, with similar affinities to the case of rabbit aorta. But the maximum number of binding site values were significantly lower than the value in the rabbit aorta. Furthermore, bovine aorta exhibited a higher affinity (K1 = 8.7-22.3 nM) for pirenzepine, but a lower affinity (K1 = 0.62-1.46 microM) for oxotremorine, as compared with rabbit and dog aortas. Accordingly, muscarinic receptors in the aorta are different between animal species, regarding its density and interactions with muscarinic agents. The receptors in bovine aorta may be M1-subtype but receptors in rabbit and dog aortas may be relatively M2-subtypes.", 
    "28": "Caffeine, theophylline or saline were injected daily into female rats during the gestation and lactation periods. Crude synaptosomal membranes were isolated from the brains of offsprings at various stages of development and their ability to specifically bind [3H]diazepam was tested. An other approach consisted of injecting [3H]diazepam into offsprings and cerebral specifically bound diazepam was measured. It was shown that methylxanthines were able to inhibit [3H]diazepam binding by reducing total number of binding sites in the brain of 5- and 15-day-old rats born from treated mothers, with a total recovery of control values at 25 days of age. Moreover, in vivo percentage of cerebral bound diazepam dramatically fell when rats were exposed to methylxanthines in utero and through the mother's milk. Since caffeine and theophylline displace diazepam binding not necessarily in a competitive manner, it is suggested that they could interfere with diazepam as adenosine antagonists.", 
    "29": "The correlation between serum levels and degree of amnesia following 0.03 mg/kg lormetazepam or 0.02 mg/kg flunitrazepam was analysed in a prospective randomised single-blind study evaluating 20 patients with ASA classification I in each group. Blood specimens were drawn and amnesia tests performed 20, 40 and 60 min. after drug administration. The plasma level of lormetazepam was 1.8 to 2.0 times higher than that of flunitrazepam; however, the difference of lormetazepam concentrations was considerably large between the investigated individuals. There was no difference in the degree of amnesia, but also no correlation with plasma levels was measured. A serum level breakpoint for the occurrence of amnesia could not be defined.", 
    "30": "The pharmacological effects of N3-allyluridine (N3-AUd) and N3-allylthymidine (N3-ATd) on the central nervous system (CNS) were examined by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration in mice. Pentobarbital (PB)-induced sleep, diazepam (DZ)-induced motor incoordination and spontaneous activity were used as three indices of pharmacological tests. N3-AUd and N3-ATd as well as uridine (Ud) and thymidine (Td); 0.9 mg/mouse, i.c.v., were found to potentiate PB-induced sleep, and their effects were dose dependent. Time course test showed that the most potent effects of all compounds tested on PB-induced sleep were observed at 15 min after the i.c.v. injection of these compounds. N3-AUd and N3-ATd were greater than Ud and Td in PB-induced sleep prolongation. In the DZ-induced motor incoordination experiments, N3-AUd, N3-ATd and Td exerted synergistic effect, although these compounds did not possess the motor incoordination. All compounds decreased the spontaneous activity. These results show that both N3-allylated compounds have more directly depressant effects on the CNS than the parent compounds.", 
    "31": "CGS 8216, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist with weak inverse agonist properties, reduced food intake in food-deprived rats when administered orally or intraperitoneally at doses that antagonize diazepam. This effect was sustained when CGS 8216 was administered daily for five days, indicating no rapid tolerance to the anorectic effect. Ro 15-1788 did not reduce feeding when administered orally, and was active only at high intraperitoneal doses (54 and 100 mg/kg). CGS 9896, a close analog of CGS 8216 but a benzodiazepine partial agonist with anxiolytic properties, did not reduce food intake at doses as high as 100 mg/kg IP or PO. These results support prior suggestions that benzodiazepine receptors may modulate feeding behavior, and suggest that CGS 8216 may have appetite suppressant properties.", 
    "32": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the encephalotropic and psychotropic properties of a new partial benzodiazepine agonist Ro 17-1812 were investigated as compared to the pure agonist diazepam utilizing quantitative EEG and psychometric analysis as well as clinical observations. Ten normal volunteers received randomized (latin square) and at weekly intervals single oral doses of placebo, 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg Ro 17-1812 and 10 mg diazepam as reference drug. EEG recordings, psychometric tests and evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side effects were carried out at the hours 0,1,2,3,4, and 6. Computer-assisted spectral-analysis of the EEG demonstrated after 10 mg diazepam a typical \"anxiolytic\" pharmaco-EEG profile characterized by an increase of beta activity, decrease of alpha activity and acceleration of the centroid of the total activity. Total power tended to decrease while delta activity tended to increase, although only in the resting condition. Ro 17-1812 induced in the vigilance controlled recordings a similar profile thereby exhibiting tranquilizing properties. However, in the resting condition the most consistent change was an increase of delta/theta activity along with a decrease of alpha activity, whereas only in the higher dosage range was beta activity also augmented. These data indicate a selective sedation after the novel partial agonist but are also reminiscent of changes seen after neuroleptic drugs. Dose/treatment efficacy calculations demonstrated 10 mg diazepam as the most CNS-effective drug followed closely by 0.2 mg Ro 17-1812, 0.1 and 0.05 mg while-placebo induced the least changes. Time-efficacy calculations showed a peak effect after 10 mg diazepam in the 1st hour with a gentle decline up to the 4th hour and thereafter again an increase (active metabolites), while the peak of Ro 17-1812 was consistently found in the 2nd hour with a steady decline thereafter as the encephalotropic effect in the 6th hour was less marked than in the 1st hour. Psychometric investigations showed the same time course of both compounds, with the most psychoactivity observed after 0.2 mg Ro 17-1812 and the least after placebo. The fact that the partial agonist induced more decrement in the noopsyche, but specifically in the thymopsyche, of the normal volunteers than the pure agonist may indicate a lower dependency risk of the former than the latter. Evaluation of pulse and blood pressure showed no clinically relevant findings.", 
    "33": "The pharmacokinetic behavior of clobazam and its main metabolite, norclobazam, was investigated in healthy subjects after single dose administration, repeated dose administration (28 days) and discontinuation of the treatment (15-day follow-up). The aim of the study was to confirm the time-invariance of the clobazam and/or norclobazam kinetics, in order to evaluate the predictive value of the single dose parameters for chronic administration of this drug. The comparisons of parameters after single dose and for 15 days following cessation of chronic administration, experimental and simulated plasma level-time courses, experimental and calculated steady-state minimum plasma concentrations, and half-life values at apparent and deep elimination phase, indicate a time-invariant behavior of clobazam, whereas the norclobazam pharmacokinetics appeared to be clearly time-dependent. The clinical importance of this difference cannot be adequately assessed until more is known about the contribution of norclobazam to the overall effect of the parent drug.", 
    "34": "In REM-sleep-deprived rats, phenazepam (1.0 mg/kg) prevented the SH-group content increase in the brain stem membrane proteins, but induced undesirable sedative phenomena which, however, could be eliminated by simultaneous injections of sydnocarbum. The data obtained suggest that if the brain stem membrane proteins are protected against a denaturation-like alteration (characterized by the increase of SH-group content of these proteins) during REM-sleep deprivation, there is no \"rebound\" of this sleep phase after the end if the experiment in the condition of the unrestrained behavior of the rats.", 
    "35": "Ro 16-0521 is a newly synthesized benzodiazepine derivative which is devoid of reactivity with the brain benzodiazepine receptor. The effects of this drug on plasma lipids and lipoproteins and hepatic cholesterol metabolism have been examined in the cholesterol-fed rat. Drug therapy was associated with dose-related falls in plasma cholesterol concentration, liver cholesterol content, and the activity of the liver enzyme Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. Drug therapy abolished the lipid and lipoprotein changes induced by cholesterol feeding, including those associated with a diet supplemented with olive oil to facilitate cholesterol loading. Drug therapy was also associated with an increased activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase and reduced hepatic microsomal cholesterol content. It is suggested that the cholesterol-fed rat will be a suitable model for further mechanistic studies.", 
    "36": "The stability of diazepam in an extemporaneous suspension compounded from tablets was studied. A diazepam 1 mg/mL suspension was prepared by levigating diazepam 10-mg tablets with ethanol and propylene glycol and incorporating them into a suspension vehicle containing magnesium aluminum silicate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium with flavoring and sweetening agents. Samples of the suspension were stored in amber glass bottles at 5, 22, and 40 degrees C. At various times during the 60-day study period, samples were inspected visually for signs of caking or color change and evaluated for ease of pouring and redispersion. Also at those times, the concentration of diazepam in each sample was determined by a stability-indicating, high-performance liquid chromatography procedure. The concentration of diazepam in each sample was at least 90% of the initial concentration throughout the 60-day storage period. All samples remained homogeneous and showed no signs of caking or settling. A diazepam suspension compounded from tablets was found to be pharmaceutically acceptable and easily pourable and redispersible. The suspension is stable for at least 60 days at room or refrigerated temperature.", 
    "37": "Episodic elevation of blood pressure was evaluated in two middle-aged men by assessing home, clinic, and 24-hour ambulatory values following exclusion of secondary forms of hypertension. Both individuals had normotensive home and clinic readings. The 24-hour blood pressure was 125/85 +/- 12/9 mm Hg in patient 1 and 119/84 +/- 13/13 mm Hg in patient 2; however, both patients experienced large, sustained rises in blood pressure associated with panic attacks that were not abolished with prophylactic benzodiazepine therapy. Episodic blood pressure elevations were not associated with concomitant increases in heart rate. Patient 1 underwent extensive psychological investigation that diagnosed a panic disorder, and he underwent therapy that reduced the frequency and intensity of his panic-related hypertensive episodes. Because patient 2 demonstrated hypertensive readings at work, he was given a beta-blocking agent that ultimately controlled his blood pressure during episodes of anxiety and panic. These findings suggest that patients with panic attacks may present with episodic hypertension and that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is useful in the diagnosis of this disorder and in assessment of treatment outcome.", 
    "38": "The authors examined the effect of state anxiety on the personality test scores of 56 patients receiving treatment for panic disorder and agoraphobia. The tests were administered before treatment and again 6 weeks later. For the 40 patients who improved by 5 or more points on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, significant changes in personality measures were observed at week 6, including increased emotional strength and extraversion and decreased interpersonal dependency. The authors conclude that state anxiety, like depression, is a possible confounding factor in personality measurement, and adjustment for it should be made in future studies.", 
    "39": "NONMEM, a computer program that uses the method of extended least-squares analysis, has been advocated as a means of obtaining estimates of population pharmacokinetic parameters when only fragmentary information can be obtained from subjects. To assess the performance of this program, we compared NONMEM with traditional methods for the estimation of population pharmacokinetic parameters with data collected during a phase III clinical trial of alprazolam. NONMEM estimates of the population mean clearance and its coefficient of variation were identical to the estimates obtained with traditional pharmacokinetic techniques. Moreover, NONMEM estimates of these parameters remained stable even when a few as three data points were available per subject. NONMEM estimates of the mean volume of distribution and its coefficient of variation appear to be overestimated, apparently because of the sampling scheme used to generate data for the NONMEM analysis. Suggestions for the effective use of NONMEM in clinical trials, to maximize the benefits of this approach, are provided. Our results lend further support for the use of NONMEM to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters of a drug from data generated during phase III clinical trials.", 
    "40": "Using a choice procedure, these experiments tested whether diazepam is more highly preferred by anxious subjects than by normal control subjects. Subjects first sampled and then chose between two capsules containing diazepam (5 or 10 mg) and placebo, or amphetamine (5 mg) and placebo. The number of times each drug was chosen over placebo and the subjective effects of the drugs were measured. Anxious subjects did not differ from controls in their drug choices. Most subjects chose diazepam less often than placebo, especially at the higher dose, whereas they chose amphetamine more often than placebo. The subjective drug effects (including anxiety reduction after diazepam) were similar for anxious and nonanxious subjects, despite predrug differences in anxiety. The results suggest that individuals with high anxiety are not at greater risk for dependence on antianxiety drugs.", 
    "41": "A controlled double-blind study was performed in 17 institutes using gefarnate as a control drug in order to investigate the therapeutic effect and safety of pirenzepine dihydrochloride (LS 519) in duodenal ulcer. A total of 233 subjects were studied, 110 in the pirenzepine group (LS group) and 123 in the gefarnate group (GF group). Final improvement rate of ulcer lesions (8 weeks) of LS group showed the highly significant superiority over the GF group. Cumulative healing rates based on endoscopic findings of 17.9, 49.4, 67.0, 84.2 and 91.2% were found for the LS group at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th weeks, respectively; the respective values for the GF group being 14.7, 33.0, 51.5, 66.7, 70.5 and 72.4%. Thus, the LS group showed a significantly superior acceleration of healing to that of the GF group on all occasions but the 2nd week. The improvement rate of subjective symptoms for moderately and markedly improved cases together totalled 98.9% for the LS group and 81.2% for the GF group, indicating the significant superiority of the former. These results proved the excellent therapeutic effect of pirenzepine. No significant difference in safety was found between the two drug groups. Gastric analysis was carried out before the start of drug administration and of its termination. In the healed subjects treated with pirenzepine there were a significant decrease in the secretion volume and acid output, and also a tendency to decrease in the acidity in basal secretion; and further a tendency to decrease in the acidity in maximally stimulated secretion.", 
    "42": "Period crossing analysis was used to study the effects of flurazepam (30 mg) and zopiclone (5, 7.5, and 10 mg) on delta wave activity (0.5-2.0 Hz) during the first 4 h of sleep in middle-aged subjects. The drugs do not affect the visual scoring of slow wave sleep in middle age, but modification of delta activity does occur. Mean amplitude of delta wave activity over the 4-h period was reduced by both drugs, while the total number of delta waves and their mean period increased. The number of high-amplitude delta waves (greater than 60 microV) was decreased by the drugs, and those of low amplitude (10-60 microV) increased. Power in the frequency band 1.2-2.0 Hz was reduced.", 
    "43": "The effects of an ultra-rapidly eliminated hypnotic (midazolam 7.5-15.0 mg; mean elimination half-life approximately 2 h) and a rapidly eliminated hypnotic (brotizolam 0.125-0.25 mg; mean elimination half-life approximately 5 h) were studied on transient insomnia induced by sleeping in a reclining seat. Rest in the seat did not lead to delay in sleep onset, but there was increased wakefulness and drowsy sleep and less REM sleep. There were no differences in wakefulness or drowsiness between sleep with drugs in the seat and with placebo in bed, but with midazolam, though not with brotizolam, there was a reduction in REM sleep less than or equal to 300 min after sleep onset. Ultra-rapidly and rapidly eliminated compounds used in the management of transient insomnia should be given in doses that are as free as possible from central nervous system depression as indicated by suppression of REM sleep during the early part of the night. Low doses of ultra-rapidly eliminated drugs are indicated for sleep-onset insomnia and for short periods of sleep, while rapidly eliminated hypnotics with elimination half-lives of approximately 5 h have the potential to sustain sleep free of residual effects.", 
    "44": "In 1980 Ceravolo, et al, reported the results of 5200 cases of periodontal surgery performed in dental offices on patients while under conscious sedation. In no instance was a major complication noted. Successful case management coupled with a high degree of patient acceptance prompted the authors to continue to perform full dentition periodontal surgery with the aid of conscious sedation plus local anesthesia. To date, 10,000 cases have been completed in this manner. As yet no major complications have been noted.", 
    "45": "We suggest that the following therapeutic regimen be followed in cases of isoniazid poisoning in children. In cases of intractable seizure activity in a child which remains unexplained, consider isoniazid poisoning. Give pyridoxine as an intravenous bolus to all children in whom isoniazid toxicity is suspected, who exhibit seizure activity and are known to have been exposed to isoniazid, or who have a history of ingesting one gram or more of isoniazid. It should be given on a gram-for-gram basis, and the clinician need not await serum isoniazid levels before administering pyridoxine. It can be safely given at a rate of five grams per three minutes in a 50 ml volume. In fact, serum isoniazid determinations are not available in many emergency departments and have not been shown to correlate closely with symptomatology. When available, serum isoniazid levels at best are subject to variability owing to sampling procedures (serum protein must be removed within two hours of sampling). The result is that serum isoniazid levels play only a minor role in the emergency department management of isoniazid poisoning. To potentiate the antidotal effects of pyridoxine, diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) may be given intravenously, preferably at a second intravenous site. Because the lactic acidosis seen after seizures resolves spontaneously, and because metabolic alkalosis may result following excess lactate loading, administration of bicarbonate is usually not necessary, and may be harmful in some cases. After pyridoxine treatment, syrup of ipecac may be given to empty the stomach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "A sporadic case of myoclonus epilepsy of adult onset with a benign course is presented. Its clinical implications were discussed symptomatologically and nosologically. EEG findings consisted of the slowing of basic activity, characteristic polyspike and wave discharges or other paroxysmal patterns and photomyoclonic response (PMR). The PMR was well evoked by flashes of 6-21 Hz and of yellow or red color. Clinical similarities of this case to those of hereditary myoclonus epilepsy without progressive dementia and cerebellar ataxia, and pathognomonic characteristics of electrophysiological findings indicated that the myoclonic epilepsy syndrome might share basic properties, which are state-dependent, but independent of underlying neuropathology or heredity. During sleep, paroxysmal discharges with spike(s) significantly decreased in slow-wave sleep and almost recovered in REM sleep. This finding suggests that the brain stem may be responsible for the epileptogeneity in this case.", 
    "47": "The acute and chronic effects of the antiepileptic drugs clonazepam (0.06, 0.13, and 0.25 mg/kg), phenytoin (2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg/kg), ethosuximide (40, 80, and 120 mg/kg), and valproic acid (40, 80, and 120 mg/kg) were evaluated in pigeons responding under a repeated acquisition procedure. At certain doses, acute administrations of all drugs impaired learning (i.e., increased errors) and reduced rate of responding. Appreciable tolerance developed to these effects with chronic exposure, although the physiological mechanism responsible for this outcome is unknown.",

    "49": "Locomotor activity and footshock-induced aggressive behaviour in rat was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by diazepam. These effects were significantly potentiated by chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS). Specific 3H-diazepam binding showed an upregulation of benzodiazepine receptors in the rat frontal cortex by ECS. This upregulation can explain the decreased therapeutic benefit observed in patients receiving both benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive shocks.", 
    "50": "Protopine, cryptopine and allocryptopine were demonstrated to enhance 3H-gamma-aminobutyric acid (3H-GABA) binding to rat brain synaptic membrane receptors. The above finding might be indicative of benzodiazepine-like activity of these alkaloids.", 
    "51": "[3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptors was examined in brain and peripheral tissues of rats subjected to inescapable tailshocks. Two hours after a session of 80 (five-second) inescapable tailshocks, a significant reduction in [3H]Ro 5-4864 (10 mM) binding was observed in membranes from kidney (31%), cerebral cortex (29%), heart (19%) and pituitary (17%) compared to tissues from naive animals. In contrast, inescapable shock did not effect [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to hippocampal, lung, or adrenal membranes. Scatchard analyses of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to renal membranes demonstrated that this session of tailshock reduced the density (Bmax) of \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptors without effecting the apparent affinity (Kd) of the radioligand for these sites. The effects of graded stress on [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to cerebral cortex and kidney were investigated using 5, 20, or 80 (five-second) inescapable shocks. In cerebral cortical membranes, sessions of either 5 or 20 shocks did not affect, while 80 shocks reduced (29%) [3H]Ro 5-4864 (10 mM) binding. In renal membranes, 5 shocks significantly increased (35%), 80 shocks significantly decreased [3H]Ro 5-4864 (10mM) binding (31%). These findings demonstrate that the density of \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptors in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system can be rapidly modulated by stress.", 
    "52": "The beta-carboline FG 7142 decreases conspecific aggression in male hooded rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of pretreatment with Ro15-1788 or chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in this paradigm. The six groups (n = 8) were saline, FG 7142 (5 mg/kg, immediate, IP), CDP (5 mg/kg, -10 min, IP), CDP (5 mg/kg, -10 min) plus FG 7142 (5 mg/kg, immediate), Ro15-1788 (10 mg/kg, -10 min, IP), and Ro15-1788 (10 mg/kg, -10 min) plus FG 7142 (5 mg/kg, immediate). Following injection of the more aggressive member of a pair of isolation-housed rats, the pair was observed in a living cage over four 6-min trials interpolated over a 40 min session. In the first 20 min after the injection FG 7142 decreased aggression, decreased the pinning of the other animal, and increased avoiding behavior. These effects were the opposite of those seen in the Ro15-1788-injected rats and Ro15-1788 pretreatment reversed the effects of FG 7142. CDP alone caused prolonged aggressive behavior but as a pretreatment only partially reversed the effects of FG 7142.", 
    "53": "Analogues of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) incorporating an isothiouronium salt as a replacement for a protonated amino functional group have been investigated for activity on: GABA receptors in the guinea-pig ileum; [3H]-GABA and [3H]-diazepam binding to rat brain membranes; and GABA uptake and transamination. For the homologous series of omega-isothiouronium alkanoic acids, maximum GABA-mimetic activity was found at 3-[(aminoiminomethyl)thio]propanoic acid. Introduction of unsaturation into this compound gave two isomeric conformationally restricted analogues. The trans isomer was inactive at GABA receptors while the cis compound ((Z)-3-[(aminoiminomethyl)thio]prop-2-enoic acid (ZAPA)) was more potent than muscimol and GABA as a GABA agonist with respect to low affinity GABA receptor sites. Both isomers were moderately potent at inhibiting the uptake of [3H]-GABA into rat brain slices. Comparison of possible conformations of the two unsaturated isomers by interactive computer graphics modelling and comparison with muscimol has led to a plausible active conformation of ZAPA, which may be a selective and potent agonist for low affinity GABA binding sites.", 
    "54": "AHN 086, a derivative of 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro 5-4864) containing an isothiocyanate moiety, binds irreversibly to \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptors in the kidney with an IC50 of approximately 1.3 nM. Using standard incubation conditions (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0 degrees), AHN 086 reacted rapidly with \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptors, whereas a time-dependent inhibition of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding by AHN 086 could be demonstrated by decreasing the pH of the reaction mixture, suggesting the presence of a histidine residue at or near the locus at which AHN 086 reacts. At concentrations up to 1 microM, AHN 086 did not inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding to \"central-type\" benzodiazepine receptors. Thus, AHN 086 appears to be a specific, high affinity, irreversible ligand of \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "55": "Rapid and robust changes in the chloride ionophore component of the benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex (\"supramolecular complex\") were observed in the central nervous system of rats exposed to a brief, ambient temperature swim stress. Stress-induced modification of the chloride ionophore was manifest as an increase in the efficacy of halides (Cl-, Br- and I-) to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding. In contrast, neither gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding nor [3H] flunitrazepam binding assayed in the absence of halide ions was altered by stress. Furthermore, the number of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding sites and the apparent affinity of this radioligand were increased as a result of stress, as was the ability of Cl- and low concentrations of muscimol to increase the binding of this radioligand. These changes could represent the physiological attempt of an organism to compensate for stressful changes in the environment.", 
    "56": "It has been suggested that the signs and symptoms of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome may be due to the increased production of an \"inverse agonist\" that binds to the central benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site in the brain. Ro 15-1788 (a potent antagonist at the central BZ recognition site), diazepam, and Ro 15-1788 plus diazepam were administered to groups of rats undergoing overt ethanol withdrawal. Ro 15-1788 did not alter the severity of the ethanol withdrawal reactions, but antagonized the ameliorative effect of diazepam. The results of our studies suggest that (1) the ethanol withdrawal syndrome is not produced by an endogenous ligand acting on the central BZ recognition site, and (2) diazepam decreases the severity of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome, at least in part, by its action at the central BZ recognition site.", 
    "57": "The group of 127 women is presented in which laparoscopy was carried out under ketamine-diazepam anaesthesia. The anaesthesia was evaluated from the anaesthetic and gynaecologic point of view. Additionally, the intraoperative and postoperative sensations of patients were evaluated. The results obtained show that the use of the ketamine-diazepam combination alone can provide good anaesthesia for laparoscopy.", 
    "58": "Streptozotocin (STZ) causes a rise in serum glucose, triglycerides and ketones and a fall in insulin and also leads to changes in drug metabolism. Results from rats left for 20 days indicate that there is no correlation between the effects of STZ on hepatic and serum parameters. The present study investigated the time course of the effect of STZ on hepatic drug metabolism, protein and cytochrome P-450 content and serum glucose and triglyceride concentration. STZ caused the induction of diabetes by 2 h which disappeared at 8 h and reappeared at 24 h. Drug metabolism was reduced after 1 h, returned to control levels at 2 h and remained there until 24 h. Liver protein was increased at 1 and 72 h but cytochrome P-450 was unaffected. The initial increase in serum parameters was not accompanied by changes in hepatic parameters and, thus, the two effects of streptozotocin may not be related.", 
    "59": "Physostigmine has been reported to reverse the sedation and paradoxical delirium induced by benzodiazepines. Little is known about how these drugs may interact to produce changes in cerebral metabolism and cerebral blood flow (CBF). In the present experiments, the effect of physostigmine on cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and CBF as well as the ability of physostigmine to reverse the effects of midazolam and 3-carbo-t-butoxy-B-carboline (B-CCT), a benzodiazepine antagonist, was tested in rats. Physostigmine by itself produced dose-dependent increases in blood pressure, CBF, and CMRO2, and it inhibited the decrease in these parameters produced by midazolam. Alone, B-CCT increased CBF and CMRO2, and these changes were potentiated by physostigmine. Thus, physostigmine increases CBF and CMRO2, probably by a direct effect on central cholinergic pathways. The ability of physostigmine to antagonize the metabolic effects of midazolam and to potentiate the stimulation produced by B-CCT suggests an additive effect of the two neurotransmitter systems rather than a direct interaction at the central receptor sites.", 
    "60": "Performance measures were compared to the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) as indices to assess tolerance to the residual effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics during repeated nightly administration. Twelve healthy, normal sleepers received flurazepam 30 mg, temazepam 30 mg, and placebo for nine nights in a repeated measures, Latin-square design with 19 nights of recovery separating the treatments. As compared to placebo, both drugs altered sleep stage parameters in the early (nights 1-2) and late (nights 8-9) phases of the study. Hypnotic effects were found for both drugs in the early phase, but diminished for both in the late phase. The subjects' performance the next day was disrupted following treatment with flurazepam, but not with temazepam, during the early phase. Mean sleep latency on the MSLT was reduced by both drugs during the early phase. During the late phase, flurazepam did not disrupt performance but still affected the MSLT. Temazepam affected neither index the next day during the late phase.", 
    "61": "In a displacement test using 3H-diazepam as a radioligand, the in vitro affinities of metabolites of camazepam (CZ) for the benzodiazepine receptors were 1-50 times more potent than that of CZ. In contrast, only three metabolites (temazepam, oxazepam, and hydroxy CZ), as well as CZ itself, exhibited an in vivo affinity parallel to their ability to protect against pentylenetetrazole--induced clonic convulsion in rats. In addition, CZ and these active metabolites displaced the radioligand from their receptor sites in a concentration-dependent saturable manner, indicating the competitive bimolecular interaction of these molecules with their receptors. The percent anticonvulsant effect was a nonlinear, single-valued function of the in vivo percent displacement of specific 3H-diazepam binding, independent of these displacers after i.v. dosing; this relationship could be approximated by the Hill equation. On the basis of these findings, a receptor-mediated model, including the Langmuir equation to describe the receptor binding-brain concentration relationship and the Hill equation to accommodate the anticonvulsant effect-receptor binding relationship, was constructed. This model was found to adequately relate the time course values of anticonvulsant effect and of brain levels of CZ and its active metabolites after oral administration. These results demonstrate that CZ and its active metabolites exert anticonvulsant effect by competitive binding to the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "62": "Solubility and dissolution rate of the benzodiazepine derivatives chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, medazepam, nitrazepam and clonazepam has been improved by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K 30). Increasing concentrations of the carrier as well as the preparation of coprecipitates usually supported the effect (less physical mixtures). Regarding to the dissolution PVP has a positive effect on the initial phase of dissolution particularly. Under the experimental conditions described an interaction between drugs and carrier was revealed increasing with the concentration of PVP. These interactions were of endothermic character. Connections between dissolution and binding results were evident. Differential thermal analysis and x-ray diffractometric studies probably refer to a partial amorphous form of the drugs, especially in coprecipitates with a higher concentration of PVP.", 
    "63": "Quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) analysis was performed in rats following the oral administration of SR 41378 [3-(4-hydroxy-1-piperidinyl)-6-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-pyridazine], a novel aminopyridazine derivative, which has been shown to possess anticonvulsant, antianxiety and hypnotic activities in mice and rats. The EEG effects of SR 41378 (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) were compared to those of secobarbital (30 and 60 mg/kg) and diazepam (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg). SR 41378 and secobarbital increased the power of the middle-frequencies (8-16 Hz) of the EEG, reduced that of 4-8 Hz (theta) activities and did not affect 1-4 Hz (delta) activities. Diazepam also increased the power of middle-frequency activities and decreased that of both delta and theta activities. Quantitative EEG profiles were calculated from the mean integrated power (MIP) of selected frequency bands. The QEEG profile of SR 41378 was found to share common characteristics with those of secobarbital and diazepam: dose-dependent decrease of theta band MIP and increase of 8-20 Hz (middle beta bands) MIP. However, both SR 41378 and secobarbital induced a reduction of the 28-32 Hz (fast beta bands) MIP, whereas diazepam diminished the delta band. These results suggest that SR 41378, a novel chemical structure, shares common psychotropic properties with barbiturates and benzodiazepines.", 
    "64": "Polysomnographic EEGs were recorded from 12 adult volunteers between the ages of 20 and 50 years. They were given placebo, pentobarbital, carbromal, methaqualone, flunitrazepam, lormetazepam and triazolam. The visual evaluation was aimed at finding periodic sequences of centro-parietal sleep spindles at 13-15/s. Four consecutive spindles following each other regularly were defined as the shortest sequence. Placebo showed the following results: a considerable interindividual variance with 2 to 6 such sequences on the one hand and 25 on the other hand for each night. sequences with six periodically consecutive spindles dominated; the longest sequence contained 15 spindles. the inter-spindle distance was 4 seconds (m: 4.09; mean 4.14 s). All hypnotics caused an increase in periodic spindle sequences. Volunteers with a low tendency to have periodic spindle sequences remained at the lower end of the scale when taking hypnotics. Hypnotics increased the amount of longer spindle sequences, however, the average was still at sequences of 4-11 consecutive spindles. The inter-spindle distance became longer with all hypnotics; 4.34 s (carbromal) up to 4.58 s (flunitrazepam). Volunteers with a low tendency to have periodic spindle sequences showed shorter distances between spindles vice versa. Benzodiazepines do not reveal any characteristics due to their pharmacokinetic structure.", 
    "65": "The cognitive function and psychomotor performance of 10 healthy male volunteers were measured following single oral doses of: zopiclone (7.5 mg), flurazepam (15 mg), lormetazepam (1 mg), triazolam (0.25 mg) and placebo. The performance tests selected (stroop task, five choice serial reaction time, memory span, logical reasoning, mood and saccadic eye movement analysis) were thought to reflect aspects of normal daily activity. The tests demonstrated a clear reduction of performance for all active treatments. No drug emerged as the most potent sedative overall, as each of the tests was affected to a different degree by each drug. Drug effects were not qualitatively different between active treatments so that zopiclone was indistinguishable from the three benzodiazepines with which it was compared."
