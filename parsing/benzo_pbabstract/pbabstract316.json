This review covers pharmacokinetics, indications, adverse effects and drug interactions, and compares the profiles of different benzodiazepines. Finally, controversial issues with regard to benzodiazepines are discussed.", 
    "1": "Efficacy studies provide information on drug safety and its effect on symptoms, but their designs limit the general application of results to other settings. Functional outcomes, although difficult to measure, offer the most complete view of a medication's effect on the patient. A community mental health center (CMHC) is a common forum for treating schizophrenic patients, which presents an opportunity to study a drug's effect on patients in a natural setting. This study setting is useful because in the community patients face daily life situations, interact with family members and caregivers, and may suffer from comorbid illnesses or conditions that can affect outcomes. Douglas Noordsy, MD, Medical Director of the Mental Health Center of Greater Manchester, New Hampshire, has begun a study to examine the effectiveness of olanzapine compared with the effectiveness of typical antipsychotic medications in the CMHC setting. The initial data in Dr. Noordsy's study confirm the benefits of olanzapine for clinical symptoms and suggest positive results for functional outcomes in the future.", 
    "2": "With the advent of atypical agents in the treatment of schizophrenia, physicians and policy makers must consider the costs that may accompany greater clinical efficacy. Analyses reveal that olanzapine shows a greater clinical cost effectiveness, as well as a greater functional cost effectiveness, than haloperidol, and that functional outcomes, in particular, show promise as important measures of effectiveness. Functional outcomes can help differentiate medications and can be used to help demonstrate the cost effectiveness of atypical agents. Mental health and physical health functioning, as well as work status, are all measures of functioning that have been used to evaluate treatment strategies. When comparing olanzapine with haloperidol, cost savings are seen throughout the treatment period (1 year), with physical functioning most highly affected over time. Functional outcomes can therefore serve 2 purposes: to enhance compliance by improving health-related quality of life and to assist in making both treatment and formulary decisions.", 
    "3": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent which is at least as effective as the conventional agent haloperidol and the atypical agent risperidone. Olanzapine may be superior to haloperidol in some respects, including treatment of negative symptoms. A major advantage of olanzapine over haloperidol is its lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine improves quality of life and other aspects of functioning to a greater extent than haloperidol, and improves quality of life to at least the same extent as risperidone. However, olanzapine has a high acquisition cost compared with conventional antipsychotics. Despite this, most pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that treatment with olanzapine does not significantly increase, and may even decrease, the overall direct treatment costs of schizophrenia, compared with haloperidol. Total direct medical costs calculated from prospective resource utilisation data were lower with olanzapine than with haloperidol by $US388 (1995 values) per patient over 6 weeks and by $US55 per patient per month during 46 weeks extended treatment. In a mixed effects linear model of the same data, total costs over 1 year were $US10,301 (1996 values) per patient lower with olanzapine than haloperidol, and olanzapine was associated with 18.3 more symptom-free days per patient. Compared with risperidone, mean total direct medical costs over 28 weeks were $US493 (1995 values) per patient lower with olanzapine. In a Markov model of 5 years' treatment, olanzapine was associated with more time in a disability-free state than haloperidol at a total cost per patient that was lower by $US1539 (1995 values), 816 Pounds (1995/1996 values), 977 Dutch guilders (NLG; 1995 values) and 2296 Deutschmarks in US, UK, Dutch and German analyses, respectively. In a similar Spanish analysis, the overall total cost was higher with olanzapine, giving an incremental cost effectiveness for olanzapine of 32,516 pesetas (1995 values) per month of disability-free time gained. When risperidone was a comparator, the total cost per patient was $US1875 and NLG202 lower with olanzapine in US and Dutch analyses, respectively.", 
    "4": "The high acquisition cost of olanzapine is offset by reductions in other treatment costs in patients with schizophrenia. Compared with haloperidol, the drug improved patient outcome and quality of life, while overall direct treatment costs were generally not increased, or even decreased. Olanzapine has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs compared with risperidone, but confirmation is required. Olanzapine is a cost-effective alternative to conventional agents for the treatment of moderately to severely ill patients with longstanding schizophrenia.",

Clinically important improvements on the Quality of Life Scale were achieved during acute treatment in 33% of olanzapine recipients and 25% of haloperidol recipients (p = 0.094). Olanzapine treatment in the acute phase led to significantly lower inpatient ($US5125 vs $US5795, p = 0.038) and outpatient ($US663 vs $US692, p = 0.001) costs, resulting in a significant overall reduction in mean total medical costs of $US388 (p = 0.033). This significant reduction in total costs was found despite olanzapine mean medication costs being significantly greater than haloperidol medication costs ($US326 vs $US15, p < 0.001). No significant differences in clinical improvement were observed in the maintenance phase. Maintenance phase olanzapine mean total medical costs were $US636 lower than haloperidol total costs (p = 0.128). Although olanzapine medication costs were significantly higher than haloperidol medication costs ($US3461 vs $US95, p < 0.001), this difference was offset by significantly lower inpatient ($US8322 vs $US10,662, p = 0.044) and outpatient ($US3810 vs $US5473, p = 0.038) costs.",

Careful attention must be paid to the ABCs, including glucose. Seizures lasting more than five minutes should be treated with i.v. diazepam or lorazepam. Careful history-taking to look for possible causes of seizures, as well as a detailed description of the event, are invaluable to ED staff in the evaluation and treatment of a patient with a seizure.

At LD10 of 6.61 mg/kg, a dose to weight ratio of 28 was obtained for a 240 g rat, while at a maximum single dose of 3 mg/kg in man it is only 0.04. Neither diazepam nor phenobarbital influenced death at the doses of both drugs used. However, cholestyramine 2 g/kg/day was found to protect by 50% from the LD100 of indomethacin. Gross pathological studies showed dose-dependent ulceration and perforation (P < 0.001, 12 vs 24 mg/kg) and such lesions occurred in starved rats, were low in bile duct-ligated compared to sham-operated rats (P < 0.001) and were also low in cholestyramine-treated rats. Indomethacin-induced lethality in rats was found to be dose-dependent.", 
    "13": "The anaesthetic interactions of the steroid, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one, in male rats were investigated in different fixed binary combinations with the steroid allopregnanolone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one), two barbiturates (thiopental and hexobarbital) and the benzodiazepine, flurazepam. Anaesthetic effects were determined using an EEG threshold method. Interactions were assessed using an isobolographic method. The interaction between the two steroids, pregnanolone and allopregnanolone, showed an anaesthetic effect significantly less than additive (antagonistic). The interactions between pregnanolone and the two barbiturates and the benzodiazepine showed an anaesthetic effect significantly greater than additive (potentiation) in all tests performed. These results could be explained by a pharmacodynamic interaction at the hypothetical GABA-benzodiazepine-barbiturate-steroid complex in the CNS.", 
    "14": "We measured nasal resistance (Rn) while awake, during midazolam-induced sedation and after antagonism with flumazenil (n = 9). Nasal and oral airflow were measured. Rn was calculated by dividing the difference between maximal nasal mask and oropharyngeal pressures by inspiratory airflow at minimum pharyngeal pressure. During sedation, two subjects developed obstructive apnoeic events and four subjects had snoring events. Each apnoea was ended by mechanisms other than a change in breathing route. After antagonism with flumazenil, apnoeic and snoring events were abolished. Rn during midazolam sedation (median 1.46 (25th percentile 1.00, 75th 2.61) kPa litre-1 s) was significantly greater than before midazolam (0.29 (0.25, 0.48) kPa litre-1 s) and after flumazenil (0.41 (0.25, 0.58) kPa litre-1 s) (P < 0.01 in each subject). We conclude that midazolam increased Rn, sometimes leading to obstruction, and flumazenil abolished this increase in Rn.", 
    "15": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors mediate fast inhibitory synaptic transmission and have been implicated in responses to sedative/hypnotic agents (including neuroactive steroids), anxiety, and learning and memory. Using gene targeting technology, we generated a strain of mice deficient in the delta subunit of the GABA type A receptors. In vivo testing of various behavioral responses revealed a strikingly selective attenuation of responses to neuroactive steroids, but not to other modulatory drugs. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices revealed a significantly faster miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current decay time in null mice, with no change in miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude or frequency. Learning and memory assessed with fear conditioning were normal. These results begin to illuminate the novel contributions of the delta subunit to GABA pharmacology and sedative/hypnotic responses and behavior and provide insights into the physiology of neurosteroids.", 
    "16": "Synaptic localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors is a prerequisite for synaptic inhibitory function, but the mechanism by which different receptor subtypes are localized to postsynaptic sites is poorly understood. The gamma2 subunit and the postsynaptic clustering protein gephyrin are required for synaptic localization and function of major GABA(A) receptor subtypes. We now show that transgenic overexpression of the gamma3 subunit in gamma2 subunit-deficient mice restores benzodiazepine binding sites, benzodiazepine-modulated whole cell currents, and postsynaptic miniature currents, suggesting the formation of functional, postsynaptic receptors. Moreover, the gamma3 subunit can substitute for gamma2 in the formation of GABA(A) receptors that are synaptically clustered and colocalized with gephyrin in vivo. These clusters were formed even in brain regions devoid of endogenous gamma3 subunit, indicating that the factors present for clustering of gamma2 subunit-containing receptors are sufficient to cluster gamma3 subunit-containing receptors. The GABA(A) receptor and gephyrin-clustering properties of the ectopic gamma3 subunit were also observed for the endogenous gamma3 subunit, but only in the absence of the gamma2 subunit, suggesting that the gamma3 subunit is at a competitive disadvantage with the gamma2 subunit for clustering of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in wild-type mice.",

    "18": "A 10-year-old girl was treated for progressive left pelvic chondrosarcoma and severe local pain radiating to the ipsilateral lower extremity. Despite high doses of opioids, pain was poorly controlled and treatment resulted in urine retention and constipation. Positive effect on pain (143 out of 181 days) was obtained by regional analgesia. Continuous lumbar epidural opioid infusion led to pain relief and disappearance of symptoms. Port-catheter dysfunction necessitated a change of epidural catheter and the patient was treated that with morphine, bupivacaine and clonidine plus clonazepam which resulted in relief of constipation and restoration of urinary function. The patient subsequently developed an abscess required or subarachoid infusion (morphine associated with clonazepam, clomipramine and corticosteroids). Later bilateral controlateral cordotomy was performed due to absence of analgesia and the patient subsequently died of tumour progression.",

    "20": "A prospective, blinded, randomized, clinical trial comparing propofol and midazolam was conducted in the PED of a tertiary pediatric center. Eligible patients were aged 2-18 years with isolated extremity injuries necessitating closed reduction. All patients received morphine for pain, then were randomized to receive propofol or midazolam for sedation. Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and sedation scores were recorded prior to sedation and every 5 minutes thereafter until recovery. Recovery time, time from cast completion to discharge, and other time intervals during the PED course and all sedation-related complications were also recorded.", 
    "21": "Between August 1996 and October 1997, 91 patients were enrolled. Demographic data, morphine doses, and sedation scores were similar between the propofol and midazolam groups. Mean +/- SD recovery time for the propofol group was 14.9+/-11.1 minutes, compared with 76.4+/-47.5 minutes for the midazolam group, p<0.001. Mild transient hypoxemia was the most significant complication, occurring in 5 of 43 (11.6%) patients given propofol and 5 of 46 (10.9%) patients given midazolam (odds ratio 1.08, 95% CI = 0.24 to 4.76).", 
    "22": "In this study, propofol induced sedation as effectively as midazolam but with a shorter recovery time. Complication rates for propofol and midazolam were comparable, though the small study population limits the power of this comparison. Propofol may be an appropriate agent for sedation in the PED; however, further study is necessary before routine use can be recommended.", 
    "23": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor plays a role in the translocation of cholesterol into mitochondria where steroidogenesis occurs. Sterols have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP)2B subfamily as the endogenous suppressor of this CYP. To investigate the role of cholesterol metabolites on the expression of CYPs, the effect of PK11195, a specific ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and a stimulator of cholesterol transportation, on CYP expression was examined in rats in vivo and in cultured hepatocytes. As judged by the change in testosterone metabolic activity catalyzed by liver microsomes, i.p. injection of PK11195 into rats increased the CYP2B subfamily significantly. A trend in the induction of the CYP2A1, 2C11, and 3A isozymes was also observed. When PK11195 was given to rats together with phenobarbital, an additive effect of these compounds on testosterone metabolic activity was observed. In cultured hepatocytes, PK11195 exhibited the same effect on CYP expression as seen in vivo, but the magnitude of the effect was much greater than that observed in vivo. The inductive effect of PK11195 toward the CYP2B and 3A subfamilies was 2.3- and 6.5-fold greater, respectively, than that with phenobarbital. The inductive effect of PK11195 was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies against CYP2A, 2B, 2C, and 3A proteins. These results indicate that PK11195 has an inductive effect on several subfamilies of CYPs by directly acting on liver cells and has no ability to suppress the expression of these CYPs. This observation suggests that, if certain sterols play a role in the suppressive control of the CYP2B subfamily, they are produced in organelles other than the mitochondria.",

    "25": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) reduce CMRGlc to varying degrees. Phenobarbital causes a mean decrease of 30 to 40%. Phenytoin, carbamazepine (CBZ), and valproate (VPA) cause milder reductions in CMRGlc. The combination of VPA with CBZ results in a greater decrease than either drug alone. The effect of novel AEDs on both CBF and CMRGlc has not been studied extensively.", 
    "26": "Fourteen patients with refractory complex partial seizures on CBZ monotherapy for 4 weeks were included in the study. All patients had baseline 18F-FDG and 15O water PET studies followed by double-blind randomization to placebo (PLC) or VGB while on continuous CBZ treatment. PET scans were repeated after an interval of 2 months on target dose of VGB (50 mg/kg) or PLC. Quantitative PET data analysis was performed using a region of interest template. Significance was tested with the Wilcoxon rank sum test.",

VGB reduced global CMRGlc by 8.1+/-6.5% and global CBF by 13.1+/-10.4%. The change in CMRGlc was different in patients taking VGB compared with those on PLC (p < 0.04). VGB patients showed regional decreases in both CMRGlc and CBF, particularly in temporal lobes. CSF total GABA increased in the VGB patient group (1.48+/-1.06 versus 4.03+/-4.19 nm/mL). The increase differed from the PLC group (p < 0.03). We found a strong relation between decreased total CSF GABA and increased CMRGlc in the VGB patient group (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.01).",

Male Wistar rats were administered diazepam in a dose of 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 3, 5 or 6 months. A additional group of rats had a one-month recovery period after five months of diazepam treatment. Control animals were age-matched and pair-fed. At the end of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed and the total cerebellar contents of ganglioside-NeuAc as well as its content in particular ganglioside fractions were estimated. After three months of diazepam consumption, no changes of ganglioside-NeuAc in investigated fractions (G(Q1b), G(T1b), G(D1b), G(D1a), G(M1), G(M2), and G(M3)) were observed. Five months of diazepam treatment caused a significant decrease in the total amount of gangliosides, which was evident in most of the investigated fractions, with the exception of the monosialoganglioside G(M2). Six months of treatment induced a generalized decrease in all the investigated ganglioside fractions. The diazepam-induced ganglioside reduction found after five months of treatment was also present after a one-month recovery period. The only fraction, which recovered and reached its control value, was monosialoganglioside G(M3).",

Learning was evaluated by one of the investigators blinded to teaching time. Subjects in the 1-hour group retained significantly less information than those taught at 3 hours after drug administration. Patients taught later answered similar numbers of questions correctly, whereas there was much more variability in correct responses for the group taught earlier. This article reviews the effects of midazolam on memory and learning as well as provides suggestions for alterations in patient education protocols for patients receiving midazolam for pacemaker implantation.

Nonpharmacologic management strategies (e.g., stimulus control, relaxation therapy, sleep hygiene) are therapeutic options that, compared with medication use, provide more sustained effects. The benzodiazepines and zolpidem are the most commonly prescribed hypnotic agents, but their use is associated with tolerance and central nervous system adverse effects. A new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, zaleplon, was very recently approved in the United States. Because of its short half-life, zaleplon will be useful in patients experiencing difficulty in falling asleep and in those who wake up at night and have trouble falling back to sleep. Antidepressants, antihistamines, and alternative medications are other treatment options. To avoid complications of therapy, hypnotic agents should be used at their lowest possible doses and for limited treatment durations.",

    "39": "Social phobia was initially classified with phobic anxiety states and was believed to be quite rare, but it is now gaining due recognition as a widespread and often crippling disorder. The boundaries of social phobia merge into traits of shyness and universal performance anxiety, with symptoms commonly appearing in the teenage years. If left untreated, social phobia is a remarkably persistent condition, leading to potentially lifelong impairment in social development and occupational functioning. It may also give rise to other co-morbid disorders, particularly dysthymia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other phobic disorders, and substance abuse. Over the years, social phobia has been all too frequently viewed as a somewhat trivial, minor form of psychiatric illness and has received little clinical attention. This erroneous perception is now giving way under the mounting evidence in support of the extensive morbidity and disability associated with social phobia and the probable role of genetic and environmental influences. Furthermore, data from multiple controlled clinical trials reveal that this is a treatable condition, responding to both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. Here we examine issues to consider in the differential diagnosis of social phobia, review the goals of treatment, and summarize evidence in support of the effectiveness of individual pharmacologic treatments.", 
    "40": "The use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), singly and in combination, has been marked by variation among European countries and by a slow progress toward a standard of care that is still far from uniform. Phenobarbital, phenytoin, trimethadione, and primidone, given in various combinations, were the predominant agents used in the first half of this century. Prescribing habits differed among the Latin countries, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia, based on local trends, divergent teaching philosophies of medical schools, and the medical specialty of the prescribing physician. The advent of carbamazepine and valproate, in the early 1960s, changed European prescribing habits. Despite early fears regarding bone marrow toxicity, carbamazepine was found to be superior for treatment of complex partial seizures. Valproate, when the proper therapeutic dosage was belatedly realized, was seen as a superior treatment for generalized and partial epilepsies. Both agents are now considered first-line treatments for these seizure types. The role of the benzodiazepines as adjunctive anticonvulsant therapy remains controversial because of concerns about neurotoxicity and patient tolerance. The number of AEDs marketed in Europe has grown dramatically in the past decade, with agents such as felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and tiagabine having been approved as either adjunctive or sole therapy. However, not all new agents are available in each European country, and some variation in prescribing persists.", 
    "41": "A prospective, randomized, nonblinded clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate whether local intraarticular lidocaine injection (IAL) is equally effective in facilitating reduction of acute anterior shoulder dislocations (AASD) as intravenous analgesia/sedation (IVAS). The setting was an urban, Level 1, trauma center. Patients enrolled presented to the emergency department (ED) with radiographically confirmed AASD and were randomized either to the IVAS group or the IAL group. Ease of reduction and pain associated with reduction were measured subjectively using a 10-point scale. There were 49 patients entered into the study, 20 in the IVAS group and 29 in the IAL group. There was no statistically significant difference between mean +/- SD pain scores of 3.32+/-2.39 in the IVAS group and 4.90+/-2.34 in the IAL group (P = .18), or mean +/- SD ease of reduction scores of 3.32+/-2.36 in the IVAS group and 4.45+/-2.46 in the IAL group (P = .12). Although IVAS tended to have a higher success rate (20 of 20) than IAL (25 of 29) in this study, Kaplan-Meier estimates for delayed time-events curves applying the log-rank test showed that this difference was not statistically significant overall (P = .16). However, with reduction rate evaluated as a function of time delay in seeking treatment, patients presenting 5.5 hours after dislocation were more likely to fail treatment with IAL (P = .00001). Additionally, half of the patients in the IAL group who had experience with IVAS did not favor IAL. Emergency physicians should be aware of IAL as an alternative technique that may be considered in patients when there are reasons to avoid systemic analgesia or sedation.", 
    "42": "There is strong evidence supporting the existence of multiple kappa receptors. Previous studies proposed that U69,593 and (+)-tifluadom act on different kappa receptor subtypes, kappa(1) (kappa(1)) and kappa(2) (kappa(2)), respectively. In this study, we investigated the effects of the kappa selective antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (Nor-BNI) on U69,593- and (+)-tifluadom-induced receptor-mediated stimulation of [(35)S]-GTP-gamma-S binding in the guinea pig caudate. The IC(50) value of Nor-BNI in the presence of a stimulating concentration of U69,593 (1 microM) was 0.19+/-0.02; while the IC(50) for Nor-BNI in the presence of (+)-tifluadom (1 microM) was 13.9+/- 1.62 nM. The mu-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP (10,000 nM) significantly reduced (+)-tifluadom-stimulated [(35)S]-GTP-gamma-S binding in rat brain sections and guinea pig brain membranes, indicating that (+)-tifluadom has mu agonist activity. Under conditions in which the mu agonist activity of (+)-tifluadom was blocked by 1000 nM CTAP the Ki value for Nor-BNI for inhibition of U69,593-stimulated [(35)S]-GTP-gamma-S binding was 0.036+/-.004 nM, whereas, its Ki value for the (+)-tifluadom-stimulated [(35)S]-GTP-gamma-S binding was 0.27+/-.015 nM. These results suggest that (+)-tifluadom and U69,593 activate pharmacologically different receptors. This study provides functional evidence in support of kappa receptor heterogeneity.",

The animals were sacrificed 25 and 38 weeks after the first injection. No tumours were found at the 25th week. A lower cancer frequency (4%) was observed in treated animals compared to controls (37.4%) at the 38th week (p = 0.002). These data show that CR2945 could prevent chemically induced colon cancer development in mice.", 
    "44": "Differences in development of tolerance and occurrence of rebound insomnia have been well established between rapidly and slowly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics. Based on meta-analytic methodology, this study assesses whether there are such differences among the rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics (brotizolam, midazolam, triazolam, zolpidem and zopiclone). All sleep laboratory studies of these drugs (n = 137) published from 1966 to 1997 were obtained, mainly through a MEDLINE search. Rigorous selection criteria resulted in the inclusion of 75 studies employing 1276 individuals (804 insomniacs and 472 healthy volunteers). Using a mixed effects regression model, reliable estimation of the effects on insomniacs of the recommended dose of each drug could be obtained. All five rapidly eliminated hypnotics showed statistically significant initial efficacy. Tolerance with intermediate and long-term use was clearly developed with triazolam and was only marginal with midazolam and zolpidem; it could not be estimated for brotizolam or zopiclone because of insufficient data. Rebound insomnia on the first withdrawal night was intense with triazolam and mild with zolpidem; data were unavailable for brotizolam and inadequate for midazolam and zopiclone. In conclusion, there are differences among the rapidly eliminated hypnotics with respect to tolerance and rebound insomnia suggesting that, in addition to short elimination half-life, other pharmacological properties are implicated in the mechanisms underlying these side-effects.",

    "58": "The presence of M(1)-M(4) receptors in guinea-pig gallbladder smooth muscle cells has been reported recently. The majority of these receptors are said to be of M(2) subtype. However, there are controversial reports about the functional muscarinic receptors that mediate contraction in this tissue. Similar to gallbladder, it was claimed that M(4) receptors mediate guinea-pig uterine contractions, but these receptors have appeared to be of M(2) subtypes later. Therefore, the antagonistic affinities of three M(2)-selective muscarinic antagonists were determined in contraction and radioligand binding experiments in guinea-pig gallbladder in the present study. The antagonistic affinity values (p K(i)) of gallamine, tripitramine and imperialine were as follows, respectively: 6.28+/-0.15, 8.65+/-0.10 and 6.55+/-0.07 against 0.250 n m [(3)H]QNB binding. All three antagonists displaced the concentration- response curves to carbachol to the right in parallel without affecting the maximum responses. The p A(2) values obtained from constrained Schild plots (-log K(B)) were 4.14+/-0.18 for gallamine, 6.79+/-0.09 for tripitramine, and 7.02+/-0.09 for imperialine. The antagonistic affinity values of gallamine, tripitramine and imperialine for M(2) receptors are reported to be 6. 3, 9.6, 7.7, respectively. The p A(2) values obtained in this study clearly indicate that the primary muscarinic receptors involved in carbachol-induced guinea-pig gallbladder contraction are not of M(2) subtype. The poor correlation between the antagonistic affinity values of these antagonists obtained at radioligand binding (p K(i)) and contraction (p A(2)) experiments also support the conclusion that the majority of muscarinic receptors which have been reported to be of M(2) do not mediate the contractile responses.", 
    "59": "Several of the actions of ethanol are mediated by gamma-aminobutyrate type A (GABA(A)) receptors. Here we demonstrated that mutant mice lacking protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) were more sensitive than wild-type littermates to the acute behavioral effects of ethanol and other drugs that allosterically activate GABA(A) receptors. GABA(A) receptors in membranes isolated from the frontal cortex of PKCepsilon null mice were also supersensitive to allosteric activation by ethanol and flunitrazepam. In addition, these mutant mice showed markedly reduced ethanol self-administration. These findings indicate that inhibition of PKCepsilon increases sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to ethanol and allosteric modulators. Pharmacological agents that inhibit PKCepsilon may be useful for treatment of alcoholism and may provide a non-sedating alternative for enhancing GABA(A) receptor function to treat other disorders such as anxiety and epilepsy.",

In the light/dark test, beta-CCT abolished the anxiolytic-like action of diazepam. In tests designed to investigate the central depressant activity of drugs, beta-CCT antagonized the sedative effects of diazepam and zolpidem, but failed to modify clearly the myorelaxant effects of diazepam. These differences may be related to the selectivity of beta-CCT for BZ(1) (omega(1)) sites as indicated by the preferential displacement of [(3)H]flumazenil in BZ(1) (omega(1))-enriched structures as compared to BZ(2) (omega(2))-enriched structures in the mouse.

Microsomal proteins of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding CYP3A4 cDNA were used to immunize mice and to develop a monoclonal antibody (mAb(3A4a)) specific to CYP3A4 through the use of hybridoma technology. The mAb is both a potent inhibitor and a strong binder of CYP3A4. One and 5 microl (0.5 and 2.5 microM IgG(2a)) of the mAb mouse ascites in 1-ml incubation containing 20 pmol of CYP3A4 strongly inhibited the testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation by 95 and 99%, respectively, and, to a lesser extent, cross-inhibited CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 activity. mAb(3A4a) exhibited no cross-reactivity with any of the other recombinant human CYP isoforms (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1) in the course of CYP reaction phenotyping and Western immunoblot analyses. The potency of mAb-induced inhibition is insensitive to substrate concentration in human liver microsomes. Therefore, mAb(3A4a) was used to assess the quantitative role of CYP3A4/5 to the metabolism of testosterone and diazepam in five human liver microsomes. The results showed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 contribute >95% to both testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation and diazepam 3-hydroxylation and 52 to 73% to diazepam N-demethylation, respectively. In addition, mAb(3A4a) significantly inhibited testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity in rhesus monkey liver microsomes to a degree equal to that observed with CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes. By comparison, no inhibition of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity was observed in the presence of dog, rat, and mouse liver microsomes. The selectivity of ketoconazole, a chemical inhibitor of CYP3A4, was probed with mAb(3A4a) and was shown to be highly concentration dependent in the diazepam N-demethylation by human liver microsomes. The results demonstrate that inhibitory and immunoblotting mAb(3A4a) can offer a precise and useful tool for quantitative identification of CYP3A4/5 in the metabolism of drugs in clinical use and drugs in development.", 
    "85": "This study investigated sex differences in responding to the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, a gamma-aminobutyric acid A antagonist) discriminative stimulus and to substitution to PTZ during ethanol withdrawal. The PTZ stimulus has served as an anxiogenic stimulus in numerous studies. Adult male and female rats were trained to discriminate PTZ (16 mg/kg i.p.) from saline in a two-lever food-reinforced task. They were then gonadectomized or sham-operated. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats were also tested during 17beta-estradiol (2.5 mg, 21 days release, s.c.) replacement. The PTZ dose response (0-16 mg/kg i.p.) was tested in all groups. In general, fewer females than males responded to PTZ. Diazepam (DZP; 0-10 mg/kg i.p.) injected before PTZ (16 mg/kg) decreased the number of rats selecting the PTZ lever. This effect was greater in sham female and estradiol-replaced-OVX rats than in male or OVX rats. Rats then received chronic ethanol diet (6.5%) for 10 days. During ethanol withdrawal (12 h after termination of the ethanol diet), they were tested for PTZ lever selection. PTZ lever selection differed between groups: sham or castrated male rats > OVX > sham female or estradiol-replaced-OVX rats. In sham female rats, estradiol concentrations showed a cyclic pattern with an estradiol surge that did not influence their PTZ discrimination performance. After i.p. injection of ethanol (2 g/kg), blood ethanol concentrations were not different in male and female rats. These findings suggest that 1) female rats are less sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of PTZ; 2) female rats are less sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of ethanol withdrawal; and 3) estrogen plays some role in mediation of these sex differences.", 
    "86": "Insomnia has numerous, often concurrent etiologies, including medical conditions, medications, psychiatric disorders and poor sleep hygiene. In the elderly, insomnia is complex and often difficult to relieve because the physiologic parameters of sleep normally change with age. In most cases, however, a practical management approach is to first consider depression, medications, or both, as potential causes. Sleep apnea also should be considered in the differential assessment. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, most patients benefit from behavioral approaches that focus on good sleep habits. Exposure to bright light at appropriate times can help realign the circadian rhythm in patients whose sleep-wake cycle has shifted to undesirable times. Periodic limb movements during sleep are very common in the elderly and may merit treatment if the movements cause frequent arousals from sleep. When medication is deemed necessary for relief of insomnia, a low-dose sedating antidepressant or a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic may offer advantages over traditional sedative-hypnotics. Longterm use of long-acting benzodiazepines should, in particular, be avoided. Melatonin may be helpful when insomnia is related to shift work and jet lag; however, its use remains controversial.",

DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/OUTCOME MEASURES: Two hundred seventy-four CPP consecutive admissions to a pain facility were psychiatrically examined according to criteria in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (3rd ed., rev; DSM-III-R), with special emphasis on all current drug use. Immediately after the psychiatric examination, all CPPs were asked to consent to urine toxicology. Urine was tested for benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclics, propoxyphene, cannabinoids, barbiturates, amphetamines, methadone, methaqualone, phencyclidine, alcohol, and cocaine. CPPs were then segregated into three groups: negative toxicology, positive toxicology but concordant with self-report of current drug use, and positive toxicology discordant with self-report of current drug use. These groups were statistically compared with each other with regard to age, gender, race, workers' compensation status, and prevalence of individual DSM-III-R psychoactive substance use disorders. Sensitivities were also calculated for two conditions: accuracy of toxicology and accuracy of self-report.",

Twenty (8.8%) of the CPPs provided incorrect self-report information about current drug use, the incorrect information most frequently about illicit drugs. Drug urine toxicology sensitivity results indicated that a significant percentage of CPPs was claiming to be taking a drug but was not taking it or taking it incorrectly. The psychiatric examination drug self-report sensitivity results indicated that a significant percentage of CPPs was withholding or providing incorrect information on current drug use. Lowest self-report sensitivity results were in reference to illicit drugs. CPPs who were more likely to provide incorrect psychiatric examination self-report information about current drug use were more likely to be younger, to be a workers' compensation CPP, and to have been assigned a DSM-III-R diagnosis of polysubstance abuse in remission.",

Alprazolam has modest efficacy, while a more robust response to clonazepam has been reported. Benzodiazepines, however, are not suitable for long-term treatment of a chronic condition such as social anxiety disorder and are ineffective against comorbid depression. Phenelzine has demonstrated efficacy but the need for dietary restrictions has limited its use. Conflicting results have been reported in placebo-controlled trials for moclobemide, with two studies showing moclobemide to be more effective than placebo while recent trials have reported less robust results. Based on clinical evidence, SSRIs are the first-line treatment in social anxiety disorder. The most extensive database for the treatment of social anxiety disorder exists for the SSRI, paroxetine.

The present study utilized autoradiographic measures to examine changes in the density of benzodiazepine ([3H] flunitrazepam), muscarinic ([3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate), and non-NMDA glutamatergic (3H alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid: AMPA) receptor binding in rats 21 days following two exposures to cocaine administered continuously for 5 days via subcutaneous pellets. A marked, selective increase in [3H] flunitrazepam binding in both the lateral and medial habenula nucleus was observed. Reduced [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate binding was observed in various brain areas, including large decreases in the anterior cingulate cortex and ventral thalamus. A reduction in [3H]AMPA binding was observed in the ventral striatum and was suggested in the nucleus accumbens. [3H] Flunitrazepam binding was also examined 12 hr following a single 5 day cocaine exposure to determine if the long-term habenular changes were evident at acute withdrawal. No alterations in [3H] flunitrazepam binding were observed in the habenula or any other structure analyzed at this time point. The relation of these results to persisting alterations in mesocorticolimbic pathways and previous findings of cocaine-induced degeneration in lateral habenula circuitry is discussed.",

Sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative synthetical opioid is being compared to methadone during a 24 week study period. A trend (p = 0.06) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone (racemat of L- and D-methadone) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7.3 mg buprenorphine (sublingual tablets). The dropout-rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout-rate of 5 in the methadone group. There was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology. The result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid (p = 0.04).

    "108": "Cicletanine, a racemic furopyridine derivative synthesized as racemate, is used as an antihypertensive agent. Its two enantiomers are involved in the pharmacological effects of the drug. Cicletanine is metabolized by conjugation enzyme systems (phase II) into sulfoconjugated or glucuroconjugated enantiomers. As oxazepam and acetaminophen are widely prescribed, especially to elderly patients, these two drugs may be co-administered with cicletanine. The metabolic profile and the kinetics of biotransformation were studied by using rat hepatocytes and liver microsomes. Cicletanine was extensively metabolized by rat hepatocytes. More than 80% of the drug was biotransformed after a 3 h incubation. The formation of glucuroconjugated metabolites was characterized by the following kinetic parameters, i.e. Vmax = 2.05 +/- 0.21 nmol/min/mg protein and Km = 287 +/- 6.7 microM for (-)-cicletanine, and Vmax = 1.44 +/- 0.12 nmol/min/mg protein and K(m) = 171 +/- 4.1 microM for (+)-cicletanine. Oxazepam inhibited the glucuronidation of cicletanine in both rat hepatocytes and liver microsomes with a competitive-type inhibition, i.e. K(i) = 129 +/- 7.5 and 152 +/- 19.7 microM for (-)-cicletanine and (+)-cicletanine, respectively. The co-incubation of acetaminophen with cicletanine showed that only sulfoconjugation was inhibited in rat hepatocytes. Glucuronidation was not modified by acetaminophen. As natriuric activity is due to sulfoconjugated (+)-cicletanine, acetaminophen could potentially modulate in vivo the pharmacological effect of cicletanine. The data of the in vitro study reported here suggested an interaction between cicletanine and oxazepam or cicletanine and acetaminophen. However, the clinical impact of such a drug interaction needs further evaluation.",

The efficacy and time course of various progestins to enhance lordosis when applied to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), following progesterone to the ventral medial hypothalamus (VMH) was investigated. Ovariectomized, oestrogen-primed rats and hamsters with contralateral VMH/VTA cannulae were tested for lordosis before and after implants of P to the VMH and progestins to the VTA. The progestins were P, 5alpha-pregnan-3,20-dione (DHP), 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one(3alpha,5alpha-TH P), 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha,21-diol-20-one (THDOC), 5beta-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one(3alpha,5beta-THP) , 17alpha-ol-6-methyl-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione-17-acetate (megestrol acetate, MA), and 6-chloro-17-ol-4,6-pregnadiene-3, 20-dione-17-acetate (chlormadinone acetate, CA).

Two hours later all other progestins, except MA and CA, increased lordosis in rats; only P, 3alpha,5alpha-THP, and THDOC were effective in hamsters. The progestins' effectiveness at facilitating lordosis were similar to their effects on GABA-stimulated chloride influx and SR 95531 receptor binding (3alpha,5alpha-THP and THDOC>P>DHP>3alpha, 5beta-THP>MA and CA).

    "123": "Drug abuse liability testing usually involves a subject population of individuals who are current or former drug abusers. To determine whether choosing subjects from a wider and more diverse population of nondrug abusers results in subjective response patterns that are pharmacologically associated with drug abuse liability, a series of studies were conducted using the prescription opiate hydromorphone and the barbiturate secobarbital to prescreen subjects before their acceptance into large multidrug, multidose abuse liability studies. The results of these prescreening studies show that there were some subjects who were not able to report consistently and reliably relevant drug effects, even though they received pharmacologically active doses as measured by objective indexes such as pupil diameter for the opiate study and psychomotor impairment for the barbiturate study. To test the consistency of these results, several of the subjects from the hydromorphone screening were retested with hydrocodone. The results demonstrate that subjects who were unable to report positive subjective effects of hydromorphone were also unable to respond appropriately to hydrocodone, and subjects who responded appropriately to hydromorphone in the prescreening study consistently responded to another opiate. Using this prescreening methodology has allowed sensitive and reliable data on the abuse liability of benzodiazepine agonists and partial agonists, barbiturates, carbamate compounds, amphetamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and prescription opiate compounds to be generated using a nondrug abusing population. In conclusion, due to the relative heterogeneity of a population of nondrug abusers compared with a drug abusing population, it is necessary to prescreen subjects for their ability to detect and report subjective drug effects, and to distinguish the effects of an active drug from those of placebo. Selecting subjects from this population has several advantages over selecting subjects from the drug abusing population that outweigh any inconvenience of this simple prescreening methodology.", 
    "124": "Principles of benzodiazepine selection are outlined for various psychiatric indications and diverse populations (the elderly, and drug and alcohol abusers). Benzodiazepines are still among the most commonly used classes of medications, and they differ in their pharmacodynamic properties. They have varied uses as monotherapy or as adjunctive medication because of their efficacy in the treatment of conditions involving a dysfunction of the GABAergic system or where neuronal inhibition is required. In multiple therapy, benzodiazepines augment the efficacy of other drugs such as lithium in mania, antipsychotics in psychotic agitation and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence and tolerance in most patients; predisposed individuals are at greater risk. Short- and intermediate-beta half-life compounds carry a greater risk of rebound and withdrawal reactions, and drug dependence than long acting agents. Adverse effects include sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, memory loss, potentiation of other central nervous system depressants and treatment-emergent depression. Drug potency and beta elimination half-life are reviewed and compared as pharmacokinetic variables.",

    "127": "The growth cone is responsible for axonal elongation and pathfinding by responding to various modulators for neurite growth, including neurotransmitters. We demonstrated an outline of the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A)-dependent signaling in growth cones. Here, we examined the effects of the modulators of GABA(A) receptor on the signaling in growth cones. Phenobarbital or propofol, acting on beta-subunit, enhanced the [Cl(-)]infi change and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation by the GABA stimulation to isolated growth cones. Besides, propofol enhanced GABA-dependent phosphorylation of growth-associated protein of 43 kDa (GAP-43) by protein kinase C. In contrast, an alpha-subunit acting agent diazepam did not modulate any of the above signals. Next, we examined the effect of the developmental change of alpha-subunit on the outline of the GABA(A)-dependent signaling in growth cones. We also found that the amounts of several different alpha-subunit isoforms developmentally increased or decreased in growth cone membrane (GCM), but that the affinity and density of the [(3)H]diazepam binding sites were similar to those in adult synaptic membrane. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that each step of GABA(A)-dependent signaling in GCM is not modified by diazepam, indicating that the signaling pathway mediated by GABA(A) receptor in growth cones is applicable to any compositional change of alpha-subunit isoforms.", 
    "128": "Emergency analysis in toxicology is a difficult exercise. It involves in diagnosis, prognosis and the treatment of intoxication. Several methods exist in emergency screening. We have distinguished three large groups. Based on specificity: screening methods of medicament family (chemical methods and immunoassays) with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates and phenothiazines; complementary screening methods (thin layer chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography) for a wider screening and finally quantitative methods (enzymatic, immunoassay, spectrometry and chromatography) specific to a molecule. The first group allows a rapid qualitative research according to medicament class but lacks specificity. The second group represented by the Remedi system, offers a larger screening of molecules but is more expensive and cannot detect classic molecules. The third group allows a precise dosage but is restricted to one molecule. We need one or the other of methods following clinical context and the type of molecule. In our laboratory, we have eliminated barbiturates and benzodiazepines research. We search only tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates and paracetamol. The Remedi system acts as a complement. It is essential to have a good knowledge of the limits and specificity of each method in order to allow the clinician to see the interpretation of the given result.

They are associated with marked psychomotor impairment and represent up to 20% of all Miami-Dade County, Florida DUI urine samples analyzed in our laboratory annually. Flunitrazepam emerged in the mid-1990s as an illegal drug in the U.S. that was predominantly abused recreationally and associated with sexual assaults. Immunoassays for benzodiazepines do not discriminate between different benzodiazepines, and certain metabolites, such as 7-aminoflunitrazepam, react poorly with immunoassay reagents. A simple and sensitive method for the detection and quantitation of major benzodiazepines and metabolites by gas chromatography with mass selective detection is presented. This method was used to confirm benzodiazepines in general and flunitrazepam in particular. Data collected over a three-and-a-half-year period are summarized. Whereas flunitrazepam was present in up to 10% of DUI cases in 1995 and 1996 and had fast become the most frequently encountered benzodiazepine in Miami-Dade County DUI-related urine samples, a dramatic drop in case numbers followed the legal reclassification of the drug as a Schedule I substance in Florida in February 1997. Flunitrazepam was often used alone or in combination with cannabis and cocaine. A recent rise in clonazepam cases coincides with the decrease in flunitrazepam confirmation and may indicate a new trend in the abuse of benzodiazepines in South Florida.",

The analytes were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250 microL/min using a solvent composed of methanol and water (60:40) containing 0.1% formic acid. The analyses were performed using selected reaction monitoring. The assay was sensitive to 0.05 ng/mL for both the parent drug and metabolite and linear to 50 ng/mL. The intra-assay percent coefficients of variation (%CV) for AL at 2, 5, and 20 ng/mL were all < or = 5.6. At these concentrations, and all OH-AL intra-assay %CVs were < or = 8.4. The interassay variabilities for AL were 11.8%CV, 8.7%CV, and 8.7%CV at 2.0, 5.0, and 20.0 ng/mL, respectively. The OH-AL interassay variabilities were 9.6%CV, 9.2%CV, and 7.8%CV at the same concentrations, respectively.

    "134": "Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) is a benzodiazepine used in the treatment of insomnia as a sedative hypnotic and as preanesthetic medication in European countries and Mexico. Although it has no medicinal purpose in the United States, the occurrence of its abuse is increasing. Sexual abuse of both men and women while under the influence of so-called \"date-rape\" drugs has been the focus of many investigations. Reported date-rape drugs include flunitrazepam (FN), clonazepam, diazepam, oxazepam, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and many others. FN has been banned in the United States because of its alleged use in such situations. Unfortunately, the detection of FN or its metabolites 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7-AFN) and desmethylflunitrazepam in a single specimen such as urine or blood is difficult in criminal situations because of the likelihood of single-dose ingestion and the length of time since the alleged incident. Hair provides a solution to the second of these problems in that drugs tend to incorporate into hair and remain there for longer periods of time than either urine or blood. There are various techniques for the detection of FN in plasma, blood, and urine, but little work has been done with hair. Hair collection is a virtually noninvasive procedure that can supply information on drug use for several months preceding collection. The objective of this paper was to determine if a commercially available micro-plate enzyme immunoassay system was sufficiently sensitive for the routine screening of 7-AFN in hair by the development of extraction procedures and optimization of the immunoassay kit. Further, this study used the same solid-phase extraction to isolate FN and its major metabolite, 7-AFN, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with negative ion chemical ionization for confirmation. Two seven-point standard curves were established ranging from 0.5 pg/mg to 100 pg/mg for 7-AFN and 2.5 pg/mg to 200 pg/mg for FN with respective deuterated internal standards. A replicate analysis of controls was performed to establish inter- and intraday variabilities. Two suicide cases along with one alleged date-rape case and one case of an emergency room patient whose blood screened positive for benzodiazepines were analyzed. All the hair specimens screened positive for benzodiazepines using micro-plate enzyme immunoassay. Two cases, including the date-rape case, were negative for FN and 7-AFN, and two postmortem hair samples were confirmed positive for FN and its metabolite.",

The limit of quantitation was 1 microg/l, the absolute recovery was above 80% at concentration level of 10 to 100 microg/l. The method tested linear in the range from 1 to 1000 microg/l and was applied for therapeutic monitoring of olanzapine in the serum of patients receiving (Zyprexa) and in one case of olanzapine overdose. Olanzapine in frozen serum samples and in frozen extracts was stable over at least four weeks. The examinations of urine extracts from patients receiving olanzapine revealed peaks of postulated metabolites (glucuronide and N-desmethylolanzapine).", 
    "138": "The possible interaction between cholecystokinin (CCK) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was evaluated in vitro in the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig ileum. Devazepide and L-365,260 were used to block CCKA and CCK(B) receptors and ondansetron and tropisetron to block 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, respectively. The CCK receptor antagonists blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, the response to 5-HT and to the selective agonists at 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-Me-5-HT) and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT), respectively. The blockade was almost complete on the first phase of the concentration response curve to 5-HT and for all the concentrations of 5-MeOT tested. In the 2-Me-5-HT-induced contractile response there was a component with the same sensitivity to devazepide and to the selective NK1 receptor antagonist, GR 82334, and another resistant component that was abolished by atropine. However, the blockade of the NK1 receptor did not produce a significant increase in the inhibition obtained when atropine or devazepide were separately tested on the 5-MeOT-induced response. These results suggest that CCK is involved in the 5-HT-induced contractile response, particularly in the response induced by 5-HT4 receptor stimulation.", 
    "139": "Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent which binds with high affinity to 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 3.4 nM), in addition to 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, and D2 sites. While it is an antagonist at these latter receptors, ziprasidone behaves as a 5-HT1A agonist in vitro in adenylate cyclase measurements. The goal of the present study was to examine the 5-HT1A properties of ziprasidone in vivo using as a marker of central 5-HT1A activity the inhibition of firing of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. In anesthetized rats, ziprasidone dose-dependently slowed raphe unit activity (ED50 = 300 micrograms/kg i.v.) as did the atypical antipsychotics clozapine (ED50 = 250 micrograms/kg i.v.) and olanzapine (ED50 = 1000 micrograms/kg i.v.). Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100,635 (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) prevented the ziprasidone-induced inhibition; the same dose of WAY-100,635 had little effect on the inhibition produced by clozapine and olanzapine. Because all three agents also bind to alpha 1 receptors, antagonists of which inhibit serotonin neuronal firing, this aspect of their pharmacology was assessed with desipramine (DMI), a NE re-uptake blocker previously shown to reverse the effects of alpha 1 antagonists on raphe unit activity. DMI (5 mg/kg i.v.) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of ziprasidone but produced nearly complete reversal of that of clozapine and olanzapine. These profiles suggest a mechanism of action for each agent, 5-HT1A agonism for ziprasidone and alpha 1 antagonism for clozapine and olanzapine. The 5-HT1A agonist activity reported here clearly distinguishes ziprasidone from currently available antipsychotic agents and suggests that this property may play a significant role in its pharmacologic actions.", 
    "140": "Noradrenergic alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine improve working memory performance in aged monkeys. Guanfacine also improves cognition in young monkeys, but there are conflicting reports of the effects of clonidine in young adult human and nonhuman primates. In the present study, high doses of clonidine (0.02-0.1 mg/kg) significantly improved performance of the delayed response task, a test of spatial working memory, in young adult monkeys. Lower doses (0.0001-0.01 mg/kg), similar to those used in human studies (0.001-0.003 mg/kg), had no effect on task performance. In contrast, monkeys experimentally depleted of catecholamines by chronic reserpine treatment have been improved by both dose ranges. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that alpha-2 agonists improve cognition via actions at post-synaptic alpha-2 receptors, and suggest that conflicting results with clonidine in previous studies of prefrontal cortical function may result from insufficient dosage.", 
    "141": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency requiring prompt resolution. Acute treatment is often delayed by difficulty in obtaining intravenous (i.v.) access. Refractory GCSE is often difficult to treat, and traditional therapy with barbiturates induces hypotension and respiratory depression and prolongs recovery. Midazolam is particularly useful for treating acute GCSE because it has an imidazole ring that is open at low pH, allowing it to be dissolved in aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, but closed at physiologic pH, increasing lipophilicity and rendering good intramuscular absorption, brain penetration, and fast onset of action. When given intramuscularly as a 0.2 mg/kg bolus, it has efficacy at least equal to that of i.v. diazepam, is well tolerated, induces little respiratory compromise, and has a shorter latency to onset of action. Therefore, it should be considered for the treatment of acute GCSE when i.v. access is problematic. For refractory GCSE, continuous i.v. midazolam infusion at 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/hr after a 0.2 mg/kg i.v. bolus is effective and has advantages over traditional therapies because it induces less hypotension and cardiorespiratory depression and can be easily titrated. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of continuous i.v. midazolam compared to other contemporary therapies.", 
    "142": "The present study was designed to evaluate the role of the endothelium as an effector organ of neurally mediated inhibition of vascular tone. Acetylcholine (ACh), either released by stimulation of the submucosal ganglia or applied exogenously, inhibited phenylephrine (PE)-induced constrictions in arterioles of the guinea pig intestinal submucosa. N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, attenuated the response to superfused ACh by 74% compared with 94% attenuation obtained with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA). L-NNA attenuated the response to neurally released ACh by 98% and that to iontophoretically applied ACh by 92%. L-Arginine reversed the effects of both L-NMMA and L-NNA. Functional integrity of the endothelium was essential for the neurally mediated inhibition of PE-induced constrictions. However, neurogenic inhibition of neurally evoked constrictions was preserved despite endothelial disruption. It was concluded that at the postjunctional level, the mechanism of action of neurally released ACh was almost exclusively via a NO-dependent pathway, with the source of NO being the vascular endothelium.", 
    "143": "Although positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are increasingly used for quantitation of neuroreceptor binding, almost no studies to date have involved a direct comparison of the two. One study found a high level of agreement between the two techniques, although there was a systematic 30% increase in measures of benzodiazepine receptor binding in SPECT compared with PET. The purpose of the current study was to directly compare quantitation of benzodiazepine receptor binding in the same human subjects using PET and SPECT with high specific activity [11C]iomazenil and [123I]iomazenil, respectively. All subjects were administered a single bolus of high specific activity iomazenil labeled with 11C or 123I followed by dynamic PET or SPECT imaging of the brain. Arterial blood samples were obtained for measurement of metabolite-corrected radioligand in plasma. Compartmental modeling was used to fit values for kinetic rate constants of transfer of radioligand between plasma and brain compartments. These values were used for calculation of binding potential (BP = Bmax/Kd) and product of BP and the fraction of free non-protein-bound parent compound (V3'). Mean values for V3' in PET and SPECT were as follows: temporal cortex 23+/-5 and 22+/-3 ml/g, frontal cortex23+/-6 and 22+/-3 ml/g, occipital cortex 28+/-3 and 31+/-5 ml/g, and striatum 4+/-4 and 7+/-4 ml/g. These preliminary findings indicate that PET and SPECT provide comparable results in quantitation of neuroreceptor binding in the human brain.", 
    "144": "Mucociliary clearance (MCC), the process in which airway mucus together with substances trapped within are moved out of the lungs, is an important defence mechanism of the human body. Drugs may alter this process, such that it is necessary to know the effect of the drugs on MCC. Indeed, agents stimulating MCC may be used therapeutically in respiratory medicine, especially in patients suspected of having an impairment of their mucociliary transport system. In contrast, caution should be taken with drugs depressing MCC as an undesired side-effect, independently of their therapeutic indication. Since cough clearance (CC) serves as a back-up system when MCC fails, the influence of drugs must be examined not only on MCC but also on CC. Ultimately, the clinical repercussions of alterations in mucus transport induced by drug administration must be studied. Tertiary ammonium compounds (anticholinergics), aspirin, anaesthetic agents and benzodiazepines have been shown to be capable of depressing the mucociliary transport system. Cholinergics, methylxanthines, sodium cromoglycate, hypertonic saline, saline as well as water aerosol have been shown to increase MCC. Adrenergic antagonists, guaifenesin, S-carboxymethylcysteine, sodium 2-mercapto-ethane sulphonate and frusemide have been reported not to alter the mucociliary transport significantly. Amiloride, uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP), quaternary ammonium compounds (anticholinergics), adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase), N-acetylcysteine, bromhexine and ambroxol have been reported either not to change or to augment MCC. Indirect data suggest that surfactant as well as antibiotics may improve the mucociliary transport system. As for the influence of drugs on CC, amiloride and rhDNase have been demonstrated to increase the effectiveness of cough. A trend towards an improved CC was noted after treatment with adrenergic agonists. The anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide, which is a quaternary ammonium compound, has been suggested to decrease CC significantly. Bromhexine, ambroxol and neutral saline seemed not to alter CC, either positively or negatively. Finally, treatment with either amiloride, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, bromhexine, ambroxol, N-acetylcysteine, S-carboxymethylcysteine or hypertonic saline has been suggested as a possible cause of clinical improvement in patients, such as the experience of dyspnoea, the case of expectoration or the frequency of infective exacerbations. Other agents did not show a clinical benefit.", 
    "145": "The present study assessed the discriminative stimulus effects of phenazepam (PHZ) (2 mg/kg, i.p.), gidazepam (GDZ) (10 mg/kg, i.p.), pentobarbital (PB) (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and buspirone (B) (5 mg/kg, i.p.) by testing GABA-related drugs in the two-lever liquid reinforced operant discrimination procedure in rats. Diazepam (5-30 mg/kg, i.p.) dose dependently and completely substituted in GDZ-trained rats and in only 40% PHZ-trained rats. Following phenobarbital (40-100 mg/kg, i.p.) injections the mean percentages of PHZ- and GDZ-lever responding generally were a monotonically increasing function of dose, but peaked at 39.3 and 52.9%, respectively. The PB discriminative cue was generalized completely to PHZ, GDZ, and phenobarbital. Picrotoxin (2 mg/kg, s.c.) did not inhibit the PHZ and GDZ discriminations, while it antagonized the PB (10 mg/kg, i.p.) cue. Calcium valproate (200 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to produce PHZ effects, and partially substituted for GDZ. B failed to substitute for the discriminative effects of PHZ, GDZ, or PB, producing a maximum 9.3, 18.0, and 33.3% drug lever responding, respectively. These results suggest that the discriminative stimuli of PHZ and GDZ are similar to those of other benzodiazepine agonists. However, the PHZ cue is more selective than that of GDZ.", 
    "146": "We investigated whether the interoceptive cues mediated by the anxiolytic benzodiazepine receptor agonist alprazolam and the anxiogenic serotonin (5-HT)(1B/2C) receptor agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) in rats are related to anxiety. mCPP-induced anxiety in humans can be blocked with alprazolam, and if mCPP drug discrimination is to be used as a model of anxiety, mCPP's stimulus should be blocked by alprazolam. Therefore, two groups of rats were trained to discriminate either alprazolam (2 mg/kg, p.o.) or mCPP (2 mg/kg, p.o.) from vehicle in a two-level operant drug discrimination procedure. Cross antagonism tests were performed with alprazolam and mCPP. mCPP did not antagonize alprazolam's stimulus to any extent, but disrupted responding severely. Low and intermediate doses of alprazolam (1.0-4.0 mg/kg, p.o.) did not antagonize the mCPP discriminative stimulus; only a high dose of 8.0 mg/kg (p.o.) partially antagonized mCPP but disrupted responding in most of the animals. We conclude that, at best, there is only weak evidence to suggest that the interoceptive cues of alprazolam and mCPP are mediated by modulation of anxiety processes, and that the mCPP drug discrimination as a model for anxiety is unreliable.", 
    "147": "Previous studies showed that sensitivity to the ethanol-like discriminative stimulus effects of allopregnanolone and ethanol are enhanced during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle when progesterone levels peak in monkeys trained to discriminate 1.0 g/kg ethanol. The present study further explored the influence of the menstrual cycle phase on the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol, allopregnanolone, and midazolam. Female adult cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were trained to discriminate 1.0 g/kg ethanol (n = 3) or 2.0 g/kg ethanol (n = 4) (20% w/v; i.g.) from water (i.g.). A cumulative dosing procedure was used to test discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol (0.5-2.5 g/kg; i.g.) and the ethanol-like discriminative stimulus effects of allopregnanolone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg; i.v.) or midazolam (1.0-17 mg/kg; i.g.) during the follicular vs. luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In the 2.0-g/kg group, sensitivity to the ethanol-like effects of allopregnanolone was increased during the luteal vs. follicular phase in two of three monkeys. In contrast, average sensitivity to ethanol was not different in the luteal compared to the follicular phase in the 2.0-g/kg group. Finally, there was no difference in sensitivity to midazolam between the follicular and luteal phases in monkeys trained with either 2.0 g/kg or 1.0 g/kg ethanol. Overall, the ethanol-like discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam are not sensitive to the menstrual cycle phase. In addition, there was less influence of the menstrual cycle phase on allopregnanolone and ethanol sensitivity in a 2.0-g/kg compared to a 1.0-g/kg ethanol training dose.", 
    "148": "The present study examined the involvement of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Rats were trained to discriminate either 300 or 700 mg/kg GHB IG from water using a T-maze, food-reinforced drug-discrimination procedure. The direct GABA(B) agonist, baclofen, substituted completely for both training doses of GHB; its potency to substitute for GHB increased moderately as the training dose of GHB was increased. The positive GABA(A) modulator, diazepam, substituted partially for 300 mg/kg GHB, but failed to elicit GHB-appropriate responding in rats trained with the higher GHB dose. Finally, the GABA(B) antagonist, CGP 35348, completely blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of the high training dose of GHB, but only partially antagonized the effects of the low training dose. These results suggest that (a) GHB produces a compound stimulus, and (b) both GABA(B)- and GABA(A)-mediated cues are prominent components of this compound stimulus; the contribution of each component, however, appears to vary as the training dose of GHB is increased.", 
    "149": "The GABA(A) receptor complex contains a number of binding sites at which a variety of psychotropic drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some neurosteroids, act to potentiate or inhibit the effect of the transmitter. Many studies have reported that these drugs can produce discriminative stimulus actions, but the cueing effects of compounds acting at different sites to enhance the effects of GABA are not identical. The discriminative stimulus effects of benzodiazepines have been analyzed in detail, and there is also a great deal of information available on the effects of nonbenzodiazepine compounds acting at BZ(omega) recognition sites, which form part of the GABA(A) receptor complex. Of particular interest are compounds with selectivity for the BZ1(omega1) receptor subtype including zolpidem, zaleplon, and CI 218,872. BZ1(omega1)-selective drugs substitute for the discriminative stimulus produced by chlordiazepoxide only partially and at sedative doses. This is consistent with the view that sedative effects of BZ(omega) receptor agonists are mediated by the BZ1(omega1) receptor subtype, whereas the discriminative stimulus produced by chlordiazepoxide may be produced by activity at the BZ2(omega2) subtype. Analysis of this hypothesis is complicated by the variety of levels of intrinsic activity shown by different drugs.", 
    "150": "The novel-response drug discrimination procedure is one of several three-choice procedures developed to address interpretational difficulties that can occur under standard two-response procedures. The novel-response procedure is unique among three-choice discrimination procedures by using instructions, rather than explicit training procedures. With the novel-response procedure, participants are trained under a standard two-response (drug vs. placebo) discrimination, and then instructed that in the presence of a drug stimulus unlike either of the training drugs, responses should be made on the novel-response alternative. Several studies have assessed the utility of the novel-response procedure by comparing effects under a standard two-response and the novel-response procedure in participants trained to discriminate triazolam from placebo. Results indicate that the novel-response procedure can increase the selectivity of both placebo- and drug-appropriate responding, and in this way, allows for finer distinctions to be made among sedatives than a standard two-response procedure.", 
    "151": "In previous work, greater differentiation among ligands for the benzodiazepine site was found in rats trained to discriminate among vehicle, 0.32, and 3.2 mg/kg midazolam than in animals trained to discriminate a single midazolam dose from vehicle (i.e., virtually all test drugs occasioned low-dose midazolam-appropriate responding, but most did not occasion high-dose midazolam-appropriate responding even at high test doses). A possibility was that merely training with 3.2 mg/kg-midazolam (not previously studied) would result in greater selectivity than training with lower midazolam doses. In the present study, rats were trained to discriminate 3.2 mg/kg i.p. midazolam from no drug under a two-lever, food-maintained, procedure; and drugs from the previous three-lever studies were tested. Triazolam, bretazenil, clonazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, zolpidem, chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, and flurazepam all dose-dependently occasioned >80% responding on the midazolam-appropriate lever in roughly that order of potency. Only triazolam had occasioned midazolam 3.2 mg/kg-appropriate responding in the previous work. The greater differentiation among these drugs in the dose-vs.-dose procedure likely was due to a training dose context rather than to the high training dose per se.", 
    "152": "Drug discrimination methods that entail training with mixtures of drugs may shed light on polydrug abuse and on the actions of single drugs that interact with more than one receptor. In AND-discrimination procedures (drug A + drug B vs. vehicle), mixtures are discriminated primarily on the basis of their component drugs: these discriminations may be useful for testing interactions between component drugs in mixtures. The role of training dose, overshadowing and associative blocking in AND-discriminations have been investigated. For example, after prior training with midazolam, it was possible to demonstrate associative blocking of the nicotine element of the mixture stimulus, and vice versa. Using the AND-OR discriminations (drug A + drug B vs. drug A or drug B) increased pharmacological specificity considerably, and these procedures may be valuable for determining whether the effects of a novel mixture are similar to the combined effects of the training drugs. Ethanol is an example of a single drug that may produce a compound cue; rats trained to discriminate ethanol from water generalize (asymmetrically) to GABA(A) enhancers such as chlordiazepoxide (CDP) or pentobarbitone, to NMDA antagonists such as dizocilpine (MK-801), and to some serotonin agonists, such as trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (5-HT(1B/2C)). In addition, rats trained to discriminate mixtures of either CDP or pentobarbitone plus MK-801 generalize to ethanol. A previous history of training with MK-801 or CDP (prior to ethanol discrimination training) enhanced the MK-801-like and CDP-like effects of ethanol respectively, but associative blocking of proposed elements in the ethanol stimulus was not seen. These studies provide some support for the multielement concept of ethanol discrimination but also suggest that rules governing three-component stimuli (such as those putatively produced by ethanol) may differ from those for the two-component mixtures of drugs studied previously.", 
    "153": "The cholinergic system is critically involved in oscillatory network activity and synaptic plasticity in the entorhinal cortex (EC) hippocampal formation. Here we demonstrate robust inhibition of field potentials in layer II of the medial EC evoked by stimulation in the deep EC or in the lateral layer II by carbachol (CCh, 0.1-100 microM, K(D) approximately 1 microM). This effect appears not to be mediated by suppression of presynaptic Ca(2+)-signals since paired pulse facilitation was increased by CCh. Blockade of the effect by the muscarinic antagonists atropine and pirenzepine demonstrates mediation by muscarinic receptors, most likely of the M1 subtype. The effect is characterized by absence of desensitization and should be important for laminar shaping of oscillatory activity and synaptic plasticity during acetylcholine-dependent theta-rhythmic activity.", 
    "154": "We examined the effects of chronic in vivo antipsychotic drug treatments on G protein function and regulation. Mice were treated with typical antipsychotic haloperidol (6 mg/kg per day) and atypical agent olanzapine (20 mg/kg per day) for 14 days via mini-osmotic pumps. G protein-activated adenylyl cyclase activity in brain tissues was measured in the presence of guanine nucleotide analogue guanosine-5'-O(3-thiotriphosphate) tetralithium salt, or GTPgammaS. In frontal cortex, haloperidol treatment produced 21% increases in the GTPgammaS -mediated adenylyl cyclase Emax value (vs. vehicle controls) while olanzapine produced 20% reductions in this value (vs. controls); these effects were significant. In striatum, olanzapine treatment produced significant 31 and 27% decreases in Emax values compared with vehicle and haloperidol treatment, respectively. Chronic haloperidol treatment produced significant 24% reductions in the immunoreactivity of cortical, but not striatal, Gialpha1,2 subunits. There were no effects of chronic olanzapine treatment on G(i)alpha1,2 levels and no effects of either antipsychotic on G(s)alpha, levels. Chronic haloperidol and olanzapine treatments differentially regulate G protein-mediated adenylyl cyclase responses in brain regions possibly relating to their unique effects on G protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "155": "alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are key mediators of seizure spread in the nervous system and represent promising targets for antiepileptic drugs. There is emerging evidence that AMPA receptors may play a role in epileptogenesis and in seizure-induced brain damage. This evidence suggests that AMPA receptor antagonists could have broad utility in epilepsy therapy. Regional, developmental, and disease-associated variations in AMPA receptors produced by differential expression of AMPA receptor subunits and variations in posttranscriptional processing, including alternative splicing and pre-mRNA editing, provide a diversity of functionally distinct AMPA receptor isoforms that allow opportunities for selective drug targeting. Four types of AMPA receptor antagonist are discussed in this chapter: (a) competitive AMPA recognition site antagonists, including those of the quinoxalinedione and newer nonquinoxalinedione classes, (b) 2,3-benzodiazepine noncompetitive (allosteric) antagonists, (c) desensitization enhancing antagonists, exemplified by SCN-, and (d) antagonists of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors, including polyamine amide arthropod toxins and their synthetic analogues. Competitive and noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists are broad-spectrum anticonvulsants in animal seizure models. Their effectiveness and safety for humans remain to be determined. There is evidence that these antagonists can potentiate the antiseizure activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and conventional antiepileptic drugs. This evidence suggests that the preferred use of AMPA receptor antagonists may be in combination therapies. Agents that enhance desensitization may have advantages in comparison with other AMPA receptor antagonists to the extent that they preferentially block high-frequency synaptic signaling and avoid depressing AMPA receptors on interneurons, which would lead to disinhibition and enhanced excitability. Evidence has accumulated that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (those lacking the edited GluR2 subunit) may play a role in epileptogenesis and the brain damage occurring with prolonged seizures. Because Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are predominately expressed in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons, it is hypothesized that some forms of epilepsy might be caused by reduced GABA inhibition resulting from Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxic death of interneurons. It is further proposed that drugs that selectively target Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors might have antiepileptogenic and neuroprotective properties. Certain polyamine toxins and their analogues are channel-blocking AMPA receptor antagonists that selectively inhibit Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. These substances might give clues to the development of such antagonists.", 
    "156": "Several PET receptor ligands have been used to investigate the neurochemical basis of the epilepsies. 11C-Flumazenil binds to the central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR)-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor complex; 11C-diprenorphine, 18F-cyclofoxy, and 11C-carfentanil to opiate receptors; and 11C-Deprenyl to monoamine oxidase B. These studies should be considered alongside high-quality magnetic resonance imaging that demonstrates the structural basis of the condition. The results should be correlated with those of quantitative in vitro neuropathologic and autoradiographic studies. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy has been studied with 11C-flumazenil and 11C-diprenorphine. There is no evidence of any interictal overall abnormality of opioid receptors in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, but typical absences have been found to displace 11C-diprenorphine from the association areas of the neocortex. This finding implies that release of endogenous opioids has a role in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of typical absences in humans. In contrast, binding of 11C-flumazenil to cBZRs has been shown not to be affected by serial absences. Studies of interictal 11C-flumazenil binding in idiopathic generalized epilepsy have not given uniform results. In one investigation a slight reduction was reported in the neocortex of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in comparison with patients with partial seizures. Also observed was increased benzodiazepine receptor density in the cerebellar nuclei and decreased density in the thalamus. Widespread increases in cBZRs also have been reported in cerebral neocortex, thalamus, and cerebellar cortex. In unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, reduction of binding of 11C-flumazenil has been shown to be confined to the hippocampus and to be over and above that caused by neuron loss and hippocampal atrophy. In malformations of cortical development, abnormalities of cBZRs, as demonstrated with 11C-flumazenil PET, are more extensive than the structural abnormality revealed with magnetic resonance imaging. There often are areas of increased cBZRs, a pattern that appears unique to malformations of cortical development and that may reflect both functional and structural anomalies. In patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, upregulation of mu opioid receptors has been found in lateral neocortex without an overall increase of opioid receptor binding. The pathophysiologic explanation for this finding is not clear. Possibilities include up-regulation of mu receptors in response to epileptic activity and down-regulation or occupation of kappa opioid receptors. Important future developments in this field that will increase understanding of the processes that underlie the epilepsies will come from the development of further ligands, particularly tracers that are specific for excitatory amino acid receptors, the subtypes of the opioid receptors, and the GABAB receptor."
