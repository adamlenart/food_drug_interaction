Stress increases plasma levels of neurosteroids in the brain, which have potent effects on the GABAergic system. In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of GABAergic modulation in the protective effect of allopregnanolone on sleep deprivation-induced anxiety-like behavior and oxidative damage in mice. Pretreatment with allopregnanolone (10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) significantly improved locomotor activity, weight loss and anxiety-like behavior. Biochemically, allopregnanolone treatment significantly restored reduced glutathione and catalase activity and attenuated elevated lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels when compared with untreated 72-h sleep-deprived animals (P < 0.05). A combination of flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (0.5 mg/kg) with allopregnanolone (10 mg/kg) antagonized the protective effect of allopregnanolone and caused further impairment in locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, weight loss and oxidative damage. However, muscimol (0.05 mg/kg) in combination with allopregnanolone (10 mg/kg) potentiated its behavioral and antioxidant effects. These effects were significant when compared with the effects of either agent alone (P < 0.05). The present study indicates that allopregnanolone induces its protective effect by GABAergic modulation at various recognition sites on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. It also suggests that allopregnanolone could be used in the management of sleep deprivation-induced anxiety-like behavior and related oxidative damage.",

Techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and retinal synaptogenesis studies, have helped determine the specific areas in the developing brain and ocular structures, which are targeted by various teratogens. In this article, we also highlight a few newer agents, such as benzodiazepines, with potential for ocular malformation and morbidity in the developing foetus.",

    "3": "Ten healthy volunteers were sedated in a stepwise manner with doses of either midazolam and remifentanil or dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. One week later the procedure was repeated with the remaining drug combination. The doses were adjusted to achieve three different sedation levels (Ramsay Scores 2, 3 and 4) and controlled by a computer-driven drug-delivery system to maintain stable plasma concentrations of the drugs. At each level of sedation, BIS and Entropy (response entropy and state entropy) values were recorded for 20 minutes. Baseline recordings were obtained before the sedative medications were administered.", 
    "4": "Both inter-individual and intra-individual variability increased as the sedation level deepened. Entropy values showed greater variability than BIS(R) values, and the variability was greater during dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation than during midazolam/remifentanil sedation.", 
    "5": "The large intra-individual and inter-individual variability of BIS and Entropy values in sedated volunteers makes the determination of sedation levels by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) variables impossible. Reports in the literature which draw conclusions based on processed EEG variables obtained from sedated intensive care unit (ICU) patients may be inaccurate due to this variability.",

    "7": "There is no systematical research about the topic of dependence on antiepileptic drugs (AED) for patients with epilepsy, despite the fact that barbiturates and benzodiazepines comprise a potential risk of dependence. We hypothesize that there is no psychological substance dependence for patients with epilepsy, possibly because of their outcome expectations. The aim of the study was to examine these patients in terms of substance dependence. One hundred inpatients at the Lake Constance Epilepsy Center were asked about their experiences with AED in terms of dependence in a structured interview. We registered general statements about dependence of AED, markers for substance dependence, and outcome expectations. About 50% of the patients reported withdrawal symptoms and the development of tolerance, but less than 10% noticed loss of control and craving. Withdrawal symptoms and development of tolerance were significantly lower in a group of patients without barbiturates or clobazam versus patients with barbiturates or/and clobazam. There was no significant difference between these two groups in psychological criteria of dependence, that is, loss of control and craving. Outcome expectations of AED were clearly related to the efficacy against seizures, and only to a small amount to psychotropic effects. The study demonstrates that physiological variables of dependence are present more in patients with epilepsy with a permanent intake of barbiturates or clobazam, but psychological variables of dependence are rarely present in epileptic patients, with or without an intake of barbiturates and clobazam. These results confirm our hypothesis that substance dependence is not a major problem in benzodiazepines and barbiturates in patients with epilepsy. Outcome expectations seem to be related mainly to the anticonvulsant and not the psychotropic effect. This might be the reason for the absence of dependence.",

    "17": "The mammalian olfactory bulb receives multiple modulatory inputs, including a cholinergic input from the basal forebrain. Understanding the functional roles played by the cholinergic input requires an understanding of the cellular mechanisms it modulates. In an in vitro olfactory bulb slice preparation we demonstrate cholinergic muscarinic modulation of glutamate release onto granule cells that results in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release onto mitral/tufted cells. We demonstrate that the broad-spectrum cholinergic agonist carbachol triggers glutamate release from mitral/tufted cells that activates both AMPA and NMDA receptors on granule cells. Activation of the granule cell glutamate receptors leads to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, resulting in spike-independent, asynchronous GABA release at reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses that granule cells form with mitral/tufted cells. This cholinergic modulation of glutamate release persists through much of postnatal bulbar development, suggesting a functional role for cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain in bulbar processing of olfactory inputs and possibly in postnatal development of the olfactory bulb.",

Median time to nonsuicidal self-injury was 2 weeks, predicted by previous history of nonsuicidal self-injury. While there were no main effects of treatment, venlafaxine treatment was associated with a higher rate of self-harm adverse events in those with higher suicidal ideation.

In half of cases, confusion of varying intensity is associated with bilateral periocular myoclonias. Clinical and EEG normalization is obtained after intravenous benzodiazepine injection. From a nosographic point of view, four types of AS may be recognized. Typical AS occurs as part of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies. \"De novo\" AS of late onset is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged subjects with no previous history of epilepsy. AS with focal characteristics occurs in subjects with a preexisting or newly developing partial epilepsy, most often of extratemporal origin. Most cases are transitional forms between these four entities. CPSE is characterized by continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. Cyclic disturbance of consciousness is characteristic of CPSE of temporal lobe origin, which requires vigorous treatment to prevent recurrence or cognitive sequelae.

Blood samples were taken from patients before and after olanzapine therapy, and analyzed for serum TAS and MDA. In schizophrenic patients, mean values of pretreatment serum TAS were significantly less (difference = 37.4% of control) than the control value, whereas serum MDA levels were significantly higher (difference = 176% of control) than the control values . Olanzapine treatment for 2 months significantly increased serum TAS levels (37.8%) and reduced serum MDA levels (22.2%) in comparison to respective pretreatment values.

    "71": "Studies in humans and in animals indicate that psychological stress can modulate immune responses. Here we demonstrate that exposure to psychological stress (restraint stress) suppresses innate interferon (IFN)-gamma production in mice following an in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. IFN-gamma signaling was also impaired by stress, as indicated by reduced STAT1 phosphorylation and reduced expression of the IFN-gamma-inducible genes, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10). Furthermore, restraint stress suppressed production of the IFN-gamma inducing cytokine interleukin (IL)-12 and increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which can inhibit both IL-12 and IFN-gamma production. However, using IL-10 knockout mice, we demonstrate that IL-10 does not mediate the suppressive effect of restraint stress on innate IFN-gamma production. Restraint stress increased corticosterone concentrations in serum and spleen, and consistent with a role for glucocorticoids in the immunosuppressive actions of stress, pre-treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone completely blocked the stress-related suppression of innate IFN-gamma production. Addition of exogenous IL-12 to LPS-stimulated spleen cells reversed the suppressive effect of both restraint stress and corticosterone on IFN-gamma production. These data suggest that reduced IL-12 production is a key event in stress-induced suppression of innate IFN-gamma production. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-treatment with the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide prevents the suppressive effect of stress on innate IFN-gamma production, and also attenuates the stress-induced increase in circulating corticosterone concentrations.",

    "73": "A series of new benzolactam derivatives was synthesized and the derivatives were evaluated for their affinities at the dopamine D(1), D(2), and D(3) receptors. Some of these compounds showed high D(2) and/or D(3) affinity and selectivity over the D(1) receptor. The SAR study of these compounds revealed structural characteristics that decisively influenced their D(2) and D(3) affinities. Structural models of the complexes between some of the most representative compounds of this series and the D(2) and D(3) receptors were obtained with the aim of rationalizing the observed experimental results. Moreover, selected compounds showed moderate binding affinity on 5-HT(2A) which could contribute to reducing the occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects as potential antipsychotics.",

It is aimed to give a close picture to the demography, toxicological data, manner, cause of death and other associated findings in such cases. Postmortem forensic pathology reports for all autopsies examined in the National Institute of Forensic Medicine were reviewed over a 5-year period and drug abuse associated deaths were selected. The study revealed that 44 cases (0.76%) out of the 5789 total autopsies were attributed to drug abuse associated deaths. The age range was from 20 to 60 years (mean+/-S.D.=32.7+/-7.2). More than 80% of cases were Jordanian males. The reported abuse substances as single drug or in combination were alcohol in 56.8%, morphine 36.4%, heroin 15.9%, benzodiazepines in 11.4% and cocaine in one body packer case. Surprisingly, neither a case with amphetamine or amphetamine analogue, nor with marijuana or methadone was recorded. In 75% of cases the death was accidental and only one case was reported to be suicidal, while in 18.2% and 4.5% death was due to sudden death and road traffic accidents, respectively. Regarding the cause of death, it was related to drug overdose in 50% of cases and in 34.1%, 11.4% and 4.5% of cases it was attributed to drug related medical complications, non-drug related complications, and trauma, respectively. Alcohol was mainly associated with accidental death; morphine and heroin were associated with drug overdose and abused through intravenous route. Injection marks were reported in 56.8% of cases and in 52.3% death occurred at home. This study confirmed the variation in the incidence and type of abused substances in Jordan compared with different countries.", 
    "75": "The diagnosis of status epilepticus can be retained, wrongly, in several circumstances. Nonepileptic pseudoseizures from a psychiatric origin and some movement disorders can mimic convulsive status epilepticus. Encephalopathy of various causes (post-anoxic, metabolic, toxic, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) can be wrongly taken for non-convulsive status epilepticus, mainly due to inadequate interpretation of the electroencephalogram (EEG). In these encephalopathies, the existence of (non-epileptic) myoclonus and the abolition of the EEG abnormalities with the use of a benzodiazepine (without correction of the clinical symptoms) are additional confounding factors, leading to false diagnosis. Nevertheless, in general, the diagnosis of status epilepticus can be confirmed or rejected base on a combined analysis of the clinical data and the EEG.",

The mice were either treated orally with three different concentrations of the PF extract or the positive control diazepam. The number of entries in the open arms was significantly increased after administration of diazepam compared to the control. PF extract showed a significant increase in number of open arm entries at a concentration of 375 mg/kg, whereas no activity was observed in 150 and 600 mg/kg, respectively, indicating an U-shaped dose response curve.

    "87": "The prevalence of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) varies between 20-90%, depending on the care settings and severity of the dementia syndrome. BPSD is the major reason for referrals to secondary care. It exacerbates the dementia-associated morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, while BPSD is not a properly defined syndrome, it frequently induces psychic and somatic complaints in caregivers. The social and economic impacts of the BPSD far outweigh the importance of the cognitive symptoms of dementia. The aim of this review is to present the most recent findings regarding the recognition, differential diagnosis, aetiology, and pathomechanism of BPSD with a special focus on the local therapeutic possibilities with the atypical antipsychotics. Of utmost importance is the process of identifying the complex bio-psycho-social aetiological factors in parallel with defining the treatment strategies. Only after the correct recognition of the potential aetiology, non-pharmacological interventions are recommended to start with as first choice treatment in mild and mild-to-moderate BPSD, while in moderate and severe cases pharmacotherapeutic approaches are recommended from the start. Recent findings of neuropathological, neurochemical and neuroimaging studies yielded unequivocal evidence that the BPSD symptoms are not a consequence of a single neurotransmitter imbalance, but rather of disproportionate level changes in biogenic amines, excitatory and inhibitory transmitters in the central nervous system. Consequently, the available pharmacotherapy should target the balancing of the dopaminergic, serotoninergic, noradrenergic, excitatory and GABAergic neurotransmission by using antipsychotics, antidepressants, phase-prophylactic agents, and benzodiazepines. Several clinical studies have proven the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics that target multiple neurotransmitter systems in treating BPSD. The first results of the CATIE-AD study also confirm these findings and indicate that the atypical antipsychotics are effective in controlling anger, aggression and delusions in Alzheimer's disease, while cognitive symptoms, quality of life and care needs are not improved.",

Overall, 18 (44%) subjects increased their daily amount of injection while 22 (54%) had no change in dose; only one subject reduced the amount of injection. Development of opioid withdrawal symptoms was the primary outcome, however the only symptom that was significantly associated with BPN/NLX dosage was the report of \"stomach pains\" (p = .01). In logistic regression analysis, the development of opioid withdrawal symptoms was associated with increased benzodiazepine injection and increased syringe sharing.",

However, the case-mix differed between public and private facilities, where in-patients had more frequently mood and anxiety disorders. The use of two or more drugs was very common, involving more than 90% of patients and including typically benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Structured psychosocial treatments were rarely initiated during the hospital stay. Increasing age, male gender, long stay in the facility (>60 days), personality disorder and type of facility were associated with a higher likelihood of being discharged to a community residential facility. Predictors of discharge to another psychiatric facility were increasing age, being single, schizophrenia, personality disorder and organic mental disorder. Families were not involved in decisions about patients' discharge in a significant proportion of cases. University psychiatric clinics and private facilities were less coordinated with the community system of care than General Hospital Psychiatric Units.

    "96": "The small intestine and liver express high levels of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), an enzyme subfamily that contributes significantly to drug metabolism. In patients with cirrhosis, reduced metabolism of drugs is typically attributed to decreased liver function, but it is unclear whether drug metabolism in the intestine is also compromised. In this study, we compared CYP3A protein expression and in vitro midazolam hydroxylation in duodenal mucosal biopsies from subjects with normal liver function (controls; n = 20) and subjects with various levels of severity of cirrhosis (n = 23). In samples from subjects with cirrhosis, duodenal CYP3A expression and total midazolam hydroxylation were lower by 47 and 34%, respectively, as compared with samples from controls. Greater decreases in CYP3A expression were seen in subjects with more severe cirrhosis. Therefore, patients with advanced cirrhosis may have greater drug exposure following oral dosing as a result of both impaired liver function and decreased intestinal CYP3A expression and activity.",

If this is the case, then drugs that reduce the CER may interfere with the mechanism by which CSs are able to motivate responding, rather than by reducing anxiety.

    "133": "Aripiprazole has been used effectively to treat schizophrenia in the clinic; however, its mechanisms of action are not clear. This study examined how short- and long-term aripiprazole treatment affects dopaminergic transmission in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways. For comparison, the effects of haloperidol and olanzapine treatment were also examined. Aripiprazole significantly increased D2 receptor mRNA expression and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) after 1- and 12-wk treatment, but had no effect in substantia nigra (SN) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Aripiprazole also decreased dopamine transporter (DAT) binding density in NAc (for 1- and 12-wk treatment) and VTA (1-wk treatment). In contrast, haloperidol significantly increased D2 receptor binding density and decreased DAT binding density in NAc and caudate putamen (CPu) after 1- and 12-wk treatment, and it also decreases DAT binding in VTA after 12-wk treatment. Olanzapine had less widespread effects, namely an increase in D2 receptor mRNA in VTA after 12-wk treatment and decreased DAT binding in NAc after 1-wk treatment. These results suggest that aripiprazole has selective effects on the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. Selectively reducing dopamine synthesis in VTA is a possible therapeutic mechanism for the long-term efficacy of aripiprazole in controlling schizophrenia symptoms with reduced extrapyramidal side-effects.", 
    "134": "The objective of the current study was to develop a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic method for alprazolam and sertraline in combined dosage forms. The method was validated by subjecting the drugs to forced decomposition under hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis, and thermal stress conditions prescribed by the International Conference on Harmonization. The drugs were successfully separated from major and minor degradation products on a reversed-phase C18 column by using 75 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 4.3)-acetonitrile-methanol (50 + 45 + 5, v/v/v) as the mobile phase with determination at 227 nm. The flow rate was 0.9 mL/min. The method was validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, system suitability, and robustness. The responses were linear over the ranges of 1-80 and 5-200 microg/mL for alprazolam and sertraline, respectively. The recoveries of both drugs from a mixture of degradation products were in the range of 97-101%. The utility of the procedure was verified by its application to marketed formulations that were subjected to accelerated stability studies. The method distinctly separated the drugs and degradation products, even in actual samples. The products formed in marketed tablets were similar to those formed during stress studies.",

The proposed method is based on the quantitative quenching effect of the studied drugs on the native fluorescence of eosin at pH 3.4 and 3.2 for OLZ and FPZ HCI, respectively. The fluorescence was measured at 547 nm after excitation at 323 nm. The fluorescence-concentration plots were rectilinear over the range of 0.05-1.0 and 0.10-1.0 microg/mL, with lower detection limits of 1.8 x 10(-3) and 1.2 x 10(-3) microg/mL, for OLZ and FPZ HCI, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of commercial tablets and ampules containing the drugs, and the results were in good agreement with those obtained with reference methods. The proposed method was further applied to the determination of OLZ in spiked human plasma. The mean recovery was 98.62 +/- 0.24% (n = 4). The method was also used for stability studies of FPZ HCI upon oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, and the kinetics of the reaction were studied. A proposal for the reaction pathway was postulated.",

These methods include relaxation techniques, sleep hygiene rules, stimulus control, sleep restriction and cognitive techniques, often also referred to as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) when encompassing cognitive strategies and at least one kind of behavioral intervention. In order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of these standard treatments for insomnia, an integrative synthesis of the existing meta-analytic studies for each of the various treatment modalities was conducted. Where meta-analytic studies were not available, data from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The summary findings from this review are (1) BZRAs and psychological and behavioral methods are effective to treat insomnia in the short-term and the latter have significantly more durable effects when active treatment is discontinued; and (2) there is only very limited evidence that BZRAs retain their efficacy during long-term treatment. The present review underscores the need for further research regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of these treatments for insomnia, how this varies with age and comorbidity, and how the various treatment modalities impact (1) daytime functioning, (2) quality of life, (3) health care utilization; and (4) pharmacoeconomics. Finally, it is particularly important that studies be conducted to determine if successful insomnia treatment influences the clinical course of the diseases that often occur co-morbidly with sleep continuity disturbance.",

Using the best performing ANN, the optimum conditions predicted were 25 mM formate buffer (pH 2.8), 10% MeOH, acetonitrile (ACN) gradient 0-15 min, 6.5-48.5%. The error associated with the prediction of retention times and peak widths under these conditions was less than 5% for six of the nine analytes. The optimised method, with limits of detection (LODs) in the range of 0.0057-0.023 microg/mL and recoveries between 58% and 92%, was successfully applied to authentic post-mortem samples. This method represents a more flexible and convenient means for optimising gradient elution separations using ANNs than has been previously reported.",

Our findings were: (i) one single MK801 application increased precursor cell proliferation and adult neurogenesis but not gliogenesis 4 weeks later; (ii) the number of label-retaining precursor cells decreased after MK801 (with P = 0.06); (iii) the pro-neurogenic effect included increased cell cycle entry of precursor cells as well as completed cell divisions, except in type-2a cells; (iv) NMDA receptor blockade also increased the number of nestin-GFP-expressing cells expressing calretinin; (v) diazepam alone had a very similar effect on overall precursor cell proliferation to that of MK801 alone; and (vi) diazepam, when co-applied with MK801, abolished the suppression of divisions of type-2a cells induced by MK801 alone, suppressed the MK801-induced effect on proliferation of type-2b cells and had no influence on the effects of MK801 on type-3 cells, but did suppress the increased number of nestin-GFP-positive cells expressing calretinin. From these results we hypothesize that, depending on the precursor cell stage, NMDA-dependent neurotransmission has distinct effects that are partly antagonized and partly enhanced by GABAergic input. We propose that NMDA receptor-dependent signalling maintains the precursor cells in the dentate gyrus while blocking initial stages of development and promoting more advanced stages.", 
    "143": "Polyvalency in the biological world is defined as the simultaneous binding of multiple ligands to one receptor. Polyvalency can increase the affinity of the polyvalent ligand by 100-1000 fold over the monovalent ligand. Such phenomenon has been employed to design polyvalent toxin inhibitors. Bivalency is a similar approach where two ligands are joined together with a linker to form a homo- or hetero-dimer with an increase in affinity by up to several hundred fold over the monovalent ligand. This review will summarize the recent advancement in designing bivalent inhibitors to be used as antitumour agents. Some dimers (e.g. artemisinin homo-dimer) simply increase the affinity of the monovalent ligands without detailed knowledge of the target. Other dimers are designed with well-characterized targets, for example, jesterone dimer (inhibiting Rel/NF-kappaB) and 3,3'-diindolymethane and their derivatives (inhibiting Akt and NFkappaB). Some dimers are designed based on the high definition structure between ligand and target (e.g. benzodiazepine and daunorubicin interacting with DNA). Heterodimers have also been produced by combining either two different antitumor drugs (e.g. cis-platin/acridine or cis-platin/naphthalimide) or combining one antitumor candidate (artemisinin) with a molecule which can increase the efficacy of the former (transferrin receptor). Finally we will discuss the design of bivalent inhibitors of the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1; MDR or P-gp) to overcome the problem of antitumor resistance.",

While some authors consider delirious mania a subtype of catatonia, the distinction between the two entities is important as treatment differs and effects outcome. It appears that as catatonia is described as having non-malignant and malignant states, the same division of severity may also apply to delirious mania. Non-malignant delirious mania meets the criteria for mania and delirium without an underlying medical disorder. The patients are amnestic, may lose control of bowel and bladder, but still respond to atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. However, with increasing progression of the disease course and perhaps with an increasing load of catatonic features, delirious mania may convert to a malignant catatonic state (malignant delirious mania) which is worsened by antipsychotics and requires a trial of benzodiazepines and/or ECT. Three case reports are presented to illustrate the diagnostic conundrum of delirious mania and several different presentations of malignant catatonia.",

BIS and AAI showed significant differences between subsequent levels of sedation (P<0.001). The clustered receiver operating characteristic curve estimate of BIS for the detection of deep sedation was significantly better than that of AAI (P<0.001). Regarding the presence or absence of eyelash reflex and patient reaction to an external noxious stimulus and to procedure-related pain, significant different levels were found for BIS as well as AAI, respectively.

We evaluated ChAT, MRs, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and nuclear factor (NF) kappaB activation in lung fibroblasts from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), control smokers, and controls. Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and cigarette smoke extracts (CSEs) were evaluated for ChAT and MR expression. We tested the effects of ACh on fibroblast proliferation and its ability to bind fibroblasts from patients with COPD, control smokers, controls, and HFL-1 stimulated with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and CSE. ChAT, M(1), and M(3) expression and ERK1/2 and NFkappaB activation were increased, whereas M(2) was reduced, in COPD and smoker subjects compared with controls. IL-1beta increased the ChAT and M(3), TNF-alpha down-regulated M(2), and CSE increased ChAT and M(3) expression while down-regulating the expression of M(2) in HFL-1 cells. ACh stimulation increased fibroblast proliferation in patients with COPD, control smokers, and controls, with higher effect in control smokers and patients with COPD and increased HFL-1 proliferation only in CSE-treated cells. The binding of ACh was higher in patients with COPD and in control smokers than in controls and in CSE-treated than in IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-stimulated HFL-1 cells.

These results suggest that cigarette smoke might alter the expression of ChAT and MRs, promoting airway remodeling in COPD and that anticholinergic drugs, including tiotropium, might prevent these events.", 
    "191": "Stress induces changes in the endogenous tone of both GABA and NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the intact mouse. Because changes are observed 24 h after stress, epigenetically-regulated alterations in gene expression may mediate these effects. In earlier work, sodium butyrate, a centrally-active histone deacetylase inhibitor that promotes gene expression, was shown to modulate the stress-induced reduction of the ability of MK-801 (dizocilpine), a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, to antagonize electrically-precipitated seizures. In the current study, we extended this work to look at sodium butyrate's modulatory effect on stress-induced changes in the antiseizure efficacy of flurazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, in two strains of mice. Epigenetic mechanisms, genetic strain differences and a standard stress interacted to alter flurazepam's antiseizure efficacy.

It is likely that if left untreated, RLS and PLMD may lead to adverse cardiovascular and neurocognitive consequences. However, the diagnosis of RLS and PLMD in children is challenging, particularly because children are relatively unable to describe typical RLS symptoms. The International Restless Legs Study Group has recently published consensus criteria for the diagnosis of RLS and PLMD in children. In addition to clinical description of RLS symptoms, supportive evidence including the presence of clinical sleep disturbances, documented periodic limb movements in sleep from overnight sleep study and family history of restless legs syndrome may be required. Few if any controlled studies have addressed the management of RLS and PLMD, which may involve both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. In this context, the importance of avoidance of aggravating factors and good sleep hygiene cannot be overemphasized. Children with evidence of low-iron storage, i.e., low-serum ferritin and/or iron levels may likely benefit from iron therapy. While there is overall limited experience regarding the use of dopaminergic agents in children with RLS and PLMD, published reports suggesting efficacy of compounds such as levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole and pergolide have emerged. Other medications including benzodiazepine, anti-convulsants, alpha-adrenergic and opioid medications have not been adequately studied in children. Children with RLS and PLMD should have regular follow-up visits to evaluate clinical improvement and to monitor adverse effects from the selected therapy. Based on aforementioned findings, it is clear that a substantial research effort is needed to evaluate the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment modalities, and overall long-term outcome of children with RLS and PLMD.",

With higher porosity and better solvent compatibility, the PVDF hollow fiber showed advantages with faster extraction efficiency and operational accuracy. Parameters of the CTC autosampler program for HF-LPME in plasma and urine samples were carefully investigated to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
