    "0": "Bromazepam, a relatively newly benzodiazepine with marked anxiolytic effects, was compared in a randomised, double-blind manner with diazepam for its effectiveness as an oral premedicant drug. A scoring system was used to assess sedation, relief of anxiety, nausea, and cardiovascular effects in two groups of women having gynaecological operations. No difference was demonstrated between the effectiveness of the two drugs.", 
    "1": "Thirty-two patients with chronic debilitating agoraphobia and panic attacks participated in a comparative study of the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam and the anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen. After a 2-week placebo washout period, patients were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with alprazolam (2 to 6 mg/day) or ibuprofen (0.8 to 2.4 g/day). Medication was identically packaged and patients were blind to the treatment condition, but investigators were aware of which medication was dispensed. Alprazolam recipients (mean daily dose: 5.4 mg) improved markedly with respect to physician and patient global rating of disease severity, frequency and severity of panic attacks, and phobic anxiety target symptoms on the 90-Item Hopkins Symptom Check List. Ibuprofen recipients (mean daily dose: 2.13 g) experienced significantly less clinical improvement than patients on alprazolam. After 8 weeks of treatment, ibuprofen patients were crossed over to alprazolam, while the original alprazolam group continued on that drug. The daily dosage ceiling was increased to 10 mg. In the ensuing 4 weeks (mean daily alprazolam dose: 6.3 mg), all patients achieved comparably marked clinical improvement relative to baseline. Pretreatment plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin--two measures of platelet turnover and release--were significantly elevated in patients relative to normal controls. The elevated platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin normalized during treatment with both drugs. Alprazolam appears to produce rapid and specific clinical improvement in patients with severe agoraphobia and panic attacks and deserves further evaluation under double-blind conditions.", 
    "2": "Five healthy volunteers received a single 0.5-mg dose of triazolam on two occasions: once with 100 to 200 ml of water, and on a second trial with 60 ml of commercial vodka mixed with 60 ml of water. There were no significant differences between control and ethanol-coadministration trials in peak serum triazolam level (5.4 vs. 5.4 ng/ml), time of peak level (1.5 vs. 1.6 hours), elimination half-life (2.8 vs. 2.6 hours), or apparent oral clearance (6.6 vs. 7.9 ml/min/kg). The potential pharmacodynamic interaction of triazolam and ethanol is more important than the minimal pharmacokinetic interaction.", 
    "3": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on feeding performance and on rearing activity were investigated using a food preference test in three Roman strains: Roman Low Avoidance (RLA), Roman Control Avoidance (RCA), and Roman High Avoidance (RHA). The aims of the study were to assess the responses of the three strains to a free choice of familiar and novel foods following a period of food deprivation, and to answer the important psychopharmacogenetic question of whether or not the strains would display differential responsivity to CDP challenges. No strain differences were discovered in relation to the latency to begin feeding, the response to familiar food, or the frequency of rearing in the 10 min food preference test. However, clear differences did emerge in relation to the animals' responses to novel foods. In contrast to the RCA and RHA lines, RLA rats sampled a greater variety of the available foodstuffs, and devoted a greater duration to the consumption of novel foods. Despite previous reports that under conditions of mild stress, RLA animals display greater emotionality, there was no evidence from the present study to show that RLA animals were more neophobic (a possible index of emotionality) than the other two Roman lines. Indeed, the evidence clearly suggests that RLA animals may under certain circumstances pay greater attention to novel cues. CDP treatments produced reductions in rearing, reductions in eating latency, and strongly potentiated the time devoted to feeding. Effects of CDP treatments on familiar and novel foods were dissociable. CDP at 10 mg/kg reliably increased the novel food feeding duration, an effect occurring mainly within the first 5 min of the test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Taurine at 10 mM had no effect on basal binding of [3H]diazepam to the membranes, while it significantly inhibited a GABA-stimulated binding of [3H]diazepam in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, but not in cerebellum. The inhibition by taurine in the presence of GABA (1 microM to 1 mM) was not competitive. At low concentrations (0.04 to 0.2 nM) the binding of [3H]propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, a ligand exhibiting higher affinity for type I than type II benzodiazepine receptors, was not enhanced by GABA, while the binding of higher concentrations (0.5 nM) was. This GABA enhancement of [3H]propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding was also selectively blocked by taurine. Pentobarbital increased the binding of [3H]diazepam in a medium containing chloride and this effect was potentiated by taurine at 1-10 mM. These findings may be relevant to the modulatory role of taurine in the central nervous system.", 
    "5": "Vocalization was induced in rats by electrical stimulation of the tail (pain-induced vocalization), and its components were characterized in terms of latency, duration, frequency spectrum and energy. Noxious stimuli at threshold elicit a single vocalization component (V1). Increases in stimulus intensity produce additional discrete vocalization components (V2-Vn) with successively longer latencies, termed the vocalization afterdischarge (AD). The AD components are acoustically similar to each other but differ significantly from the V1 component. The duration, the specific acoustic measures and the sound energy of both V1 and AD components are positively correlated with intensity of the stimulus. The dependence of the V1 and AD components on the affective state of the rat was evaluated by comparing the acoustic characteristics of both components to those of stress-induced vocalizations, and by studying the effects of the anxiolytic drug diazepam and physical restraint on the threshold of V1 and AD. The AD components were markedly more dependent on the affective state of the rat then was the V1 component. A moderately low dose of morphine (3.0 mg/kg) also preferentially affected the AD component, suggesting that a significant portion of the action of morphine on pain-induced vocalization is mediated through its action on the affective state of the rat.", 
    "6": "Adinazolam , a triazolobenzodiazepine , has been reported to be an effective antidepressant treatment in major depression. In the present study, a 14-day (but not a five-day) treatment with adinazolam enhanced the responsiveness of rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons to microiontophoretically applied 5-HT but not to NE. A 14-day treatment with diazepam failed to induce sensitization to either 5-HT or NE. Acute intravenous administration of adinazolam did not modify dorsal raphe 5-HT neuron firing rate. It is proposed that the antidepressant activity of adinazolam might be mediated by a heightened 5-HT neurotransmission.", 
    "7": "The presence of benzodiazepine receptor heterogeneity was investigated on whole rat brain membranes, at 0 degree C, using computerized, weighted nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. Data from [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H] beta-carboline ethyl ester self and cross-competition studies were analyzed simultaneously with data from the inhibition of both labeled ligands by various known and novel benzodiazepine receptor ligands. The binding model which best fits the data indicated the presence of at least two independent binding sites. The benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and 2'-Cl-diazepam showed a small difference in affinity at the two sites. The beta-carbolines and Cl 218,872 showed a larger difference in affinity, and had higher affinities at the lower affinity site for the benzodiazepines. Analogous experiments could be useful in the determination of the effect of GABA on benzodiazepine receptor affinities.", 
    "8": "The authors' purpose was to confirm their hypotheses based on their prior study of the effect of tiapride and lorazepam on memorizing capacities of patients over sixty years of age. The results of a two weeks, double-blind trial show that tiapride, in addition to its sedative action, produces disinhibition and enhances wakefulness, thereby improving memory performances in the elderly.", 
    "9": "The actions of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) antagonists 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline (3-HMC), Ro 14-7437 and Ro 15-1788 were tested on single cell activity of rat hypothalamic neurons in tissue cultures and on membrane properties of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in transverse slices. In addition, we examined the interactions of some of these agents with inhibitions elicited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as well as the ability of Ro 14-7437 to reverse the GABA-enhancing action of the BDZ agonist flurazepam. BDZ antagonists did not alter patterns of spontaneous activity of hypothalamic neurons and did not affect resting membrane potential or membrane conductance in CA1 pyramidal cells. Ro 14-7437 either partially or totally reversed the potentiation by flurazepam of GABA-elicited depression of hypothalamic neuronal activity. Small and inconsistent actions on GABA-mediated inhibitions of hypothalamic neurons were noted. Electrically-elicited inhibitions of hypothalamic neurons were either not altered or slightly reduced. In the hippocampal slice, the frequency of spontaneous IPSPs, the amplitude of stratum-radiatum evoked IPSPs and the conductance increase caused by stratum-radiatum stimulation were either not altered or slightly reduced. These findings demonstrate that non-convulsant BDZ antagonists block the action of BDZ agonists in facilitating GABA and further that the presence of a BDZ agonist is not required for these GABA-mediated events to occur. However, these experiments do not exclude a modulatory role for an endogenous BDZ agonist on GABA-mediated events.", 
    "10": "'Peripheral type' benzodiazepine binding sites in several rat tissues were labelled by intravenous injection of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H] RO5 -4864. Binding was saturable in all tissues studied and regional distribution paralleled the in vitro binding. A similar potency order of displacing compounds was found in vivo and in vitro PK 11195 greater than PK 11211 greater than RO5 -4864 greater than diazepam greater than dipyridamole greater than clonazepam. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique to examine the effects of pharmacological manipulation on the binding sites in their native state. However some properties (broader maximum during time course, higher percentage of particulate binding in the brain and independence of temperature) make [3H]PK 11195 the most suitable ligand for this kind of studies.", 
    "11": "Binding activity of the radioactive cage convulsant [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate was solubilized from rat brain membranes using the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio] propanesulfonate. Binding (KD = 26 nM, Bmax = 0.4 pmol/mg protein) was inhibited by picrotoxin and related convulsants and by barbiturates and related depressants that interact with gamma-aminobutyric acid and benzodiazepine receptors via the picrotoxinin binding site. The convulsant/barbiturate binding activity chromatographed on gel filtration as a single peak coinciding with the benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor protein complex.", 
    "12": "Localized lesions with kainic acid (KA) and local infusion of GABAergic drugs were used to study the role of the nucleus fastigii (NF) in postural tonus. Unilateral axon-sparing KA lesions of NF resulted in ipsilateral limb extensor atonia and contralateral limb extensor hypertonus and abduction. This effect lasted for 3-8 days depending on the dose of KA. Lesions of sites adjacent to the NF failed to produce postural asymmetries. Local infusion of the GABA agonist muscimol (10-50 ng) in the NF produced a reversible postural asymmetry fenomenologically similar to that produced by KA lesions of NF. Infusion of agents blocking GABAergic transmission in the NF (bicuculline, picrotoxin) resulted in a postural asymmetry of inverted laterality in respect to that produced by muscimol. Bilateral KA lesions of NF or bilateral infusion of muscimol resulted in bilateral hyperextension-abduction of the limbs. Infusion of GABAergic drugs in areas adjacent to the NF failed to produce postural changes. The results are interpreted to indicate that the NF exerts a crossed inhibitory and a direct excitatory influence on limb postural tonus.", 
    "13": "A model system was developed at the author's institution for providing toxicology and therapeutic drugs monitoring services. These services were expanded with chromatography instrumentation and the Syva EMIT-st Drug Detection System. An emergency screen for various drugs in urine takes about one hour. The drugs or drug families detected are opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, phenothiazines, cocaine metabolite, acetaminophen, and ethyl alcohol. Confirmation and quantitation of drugs in serum can be done by either higher performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, or radioimmunoassay. Sample preparation takes from five to 15 minutes and chromatography requires about 15 minutes in most cases. While more than 60 drugs can be quantitated using these procedures, rarely are more than one or two drugs present in patient samples.", 
    "14": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method is reported for the determination of clonazepam and its metabolites 7-amino- and 7-acetamidoclonazepam. Extraction from buffered plasma is carried out at pH 9.5 with hexane-ethyl acetate (7:3) for clonazepam and with chloroform for the metabolites. Flunitrazepam, 7-aminodemethylflunitrazepam and 7-acetamidoflunitrazepam are used as the internal standards for clonazepam and its 7-amino and 7-acetamido metabolites, respectively. To prevent decomposition of 7-aminoclonazepam a high concentration of 7-aminomethylclonazepam is added to the plasma. Chromatography is carried out on a reversed-phase column with detection at 254 nm for clonazepam and 240 nm for the metabolites. Using the method it was possible to determine 5 ng/ml clonazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam and 7-acetamidoclonazepam in plasma with coefficients of variation of 9.5%, 5.9% and 8.9%, respectively. This method can be used to measure clonazepam in plasma from patients treated with other antiepileptics. It may also be utilized for in vitro studies on the metabolism of clonazepam in subcellular fractions from the liver.", 
    "15": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of four separate 1,4-benzodiazepine glucuronides in urine, plasma and bile is presented. We succeeded not only in determining the single glucuronides but also in separating the enantiomers (optical isomers) of the 1,4-benzodiazepine glucuronides. The optical isomers of the glucuronides of oxazepam and cinolazepam and of two other glucuronides of benzodiazepine metabolites could be well separated. The ratio of the isomers could be evaluated. An octadecyl reversed phase was used with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and 0.01 M orthophosphoric acid. After the initial separation, the isomers were fractionated by HPLC. After treatment with beta-glucuronidase to yield the aglycone, the separated fractions were hydrolysed to the corresponding benzophenones whose identity was confirmed by HPLC. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that the separated glucuronides corresponded to the enantiomeric benzodiazepines. Human urine and plasma as well as rabbit urine, plasma and bile were examined.", 
    "16": "Oxazepam produced a significant reversible monophasic concentration-dependent (50-500 mumol/l) depression of stretch-induced discharge frequency of the isolated crayfish sensory neuron. In total contrast, flurazepam (10-200 mumol/l) evoked reversible excitation of the neuronal firing rate but at concentrations greater than 300 mumol/l it induced transient excitation followed by secondary total depression. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazepil (less than or equal to 1 mmol/l) also produced an inherent increase in neuronal discharge frequency, though respective concentrations of 50 and 100 mumol/l failed to block flurazepam-excitation or oxazepam-depression. It is suggested that these high concentration qualitatively divergent neuronal effects are not mediated through specific benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "17": "The quinolines PK 8165 and PK 9084 bind to brain benzodiazepine receptors in vitro. However, unlike diazepam, these molecules do not reduce GABA turnover, possess anxiolytic properties, or displace [3H]flunitrazepam from benzodiazepine receptors in vivo. The pharmacological properties of PK 8165 and PK 9084 in vivo are thus unrelated to the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "18": "The muscle relaxant effects of diazepam and phenobarbitone were studied in mutant Han-Wistar rats which exhibit spontaneous tonic activity in the electromyogram of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle. Diazepam and phenobarbitone significantly and dose- relatedly reduced the spontaneous activity measured in the electromyogram. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist CGS 8216 reversed the depressant effect of diazepam but not that produced by phenobarbitone. The results add further support to the suggestion that CGS 8216 may be useful to investigate the effects modified by benzodiazepine receptors in vivo.", 
    "19": "Numerous compounds were tested for their ability to displace [3H]( 3MeHis2 )TRH binding. It was found that some, but not all, benzodiazepines displaced [3H]( 3MeHis2 )TRH from its binding site. The most potent benzodiazepine was chlordiazepoxide, which had an IC50 value of 5 microM in brain tissue and an IC50 of 290 nM in pituitary tissue. Analysis of the effect produced by chlordiazepoxide showed it to be apparently noncompetitive in brain tissue but competitive in pituitary tissue. In brain tissue the Hill coefficient was less than one, whereas in pituitary tissue the Hill coefficient was approximately 1.0. In both tissues the effect was reversible and unaffected by the presence of 10(-4) M GABA or 10(-4) M flunitrazepam. These data indicate that there exists some differences between the brain and pituitary TRH receptor complex, that the inhibition produced by chlordiazepoxide is not mediated via a classical benzodiazepine receptor and the effect of chlordiazepoxide may be of pharmacological relevance.", 
    "20": "Repeated administration of diazepam in two ventilated patients had caused drug cumulation and coma over several days. In both cases central nervous depression could be demonstrated by the benzodiazepin antagonist Ro 15-1788 which induced reversal of coma. Estimation of plasma concentrations in a 70-year-old female patient 150 hours after the last administration showed a diazepam concentration of 437 ng/ml and a desmethyl-diazepam concentration of 483 ng/ml. The calculated elimination half-life of these substances were 109 and 403 hours. In the second case benzodiazepin could be demonstrated in urine for 10 days after withdrawal of medication. These observations suggest that diazepam is not a suitable drug for prolonged sedation in artificially ventilated patients. The benzodiazepin antagonist Ro 15-1788 represents a valuable diagnostic aid in ascertained or suspect cases of benzodiazepin intoxications. It can also be used therapeutically for reversal of central nervous depression.", 
    "21": "The interactions of pentamethylenetetrazole and ten tetrazole analogues with the picrotoxinin site of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-ionophore complex was investigated. All the active tetrazole analogues potently inhibited the binding of [35S]t-butyl- bicyclophosphorothionate ( TBPT ), a ligand which binds to the picrotoxinin site. Tetrazole analogues appear to interact with the picrotoxinin site competitively. All the tetrazole analogues tested were more potent in inhibiting TBPT binding than diazepam binding. There is a reasonably good correlation between the tetrazole analogues to inhibit TBPT binding and the doses at which they produce convulsions. Pentamethylenetetrazole inhibited TBPT binding at concentrations which are similar to the in vivo concentrations present during convulsions produced by this drug. These results suggest that tetrazoles may produce convulsions by acting at the picrotoxin-sensitive site of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "22": "The pyrrolo(l,4)benzodiazepine (P(1,4)B) antitumor antibiotics, anthramycin, tomaymycin, sibiromycin and the neothramycins A and B, are potent anticancer agents that form covalent adducts through the exocyclic amino group of guanine in DNA. This review describes the chemistry important for both the DNA reactivity and synthesis of the carbinolamine containing drugs and the strategy for elucidation of the three-dimensional form of the adduct with DNA. The high DNA sequence specificity as well as some of the observed biological consequences of DNA damage caused by these agents in human and yeast cells are rationalized through the proposed structure of the drug-DNA adducts. Parallel toxicological studies have led to a proposal for the underlying mechanism for the cardiotoxicity of certain members of this group of agents. A rationale for designing drugs which should retain their potent antitumor activity without the associated cardiotoxicity is also proposed. Lastly, the application of the P(l,4)B's as probes for monitoring drug binding to DNA and drug-induced conformational changes is described.", 
    "23": "Muscle relaxant effects of baclofen were compared with those of dantrolene, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and tolperisone. When administered intraduodenally (i.d.), baclofen and dantrolene but not diazepam suppressed the sustained rigidity of forelimbs in anemically decerebrated rats, and ED50 values of the former two drugs were 2.9 and 22 mg/kg, respectively. Baclofen, dantrolene and diazepam reduced the phasic rigidity of the decerebrated animals induced by mechanical stimulation of hindlimbs, with their respective ED50 values of 6.2, 140 and 1.4 mg/kg, i.d. Both the rigidities were almost insensitive to chlordiazepoxide and tolperisone. With the exception of tolperisone, these drugs also produced a muscle relaxation in intact animals as measured by traction (rats), rotarod (mice), and grip-strength (mice) tests. ED50 or eD25 values were calculated to be in the following ranges: 5.6 approximately 12 mg/kg, p.o. for baclofen, 15 approximately 35 mg/kg, p.o. for dantrolene, 2.1 approximately 6.5 mg/kg, p.o. for diazepam and 33 approximately 64 mg/kg, p.o. for chlordiazepoxide. These results suggest that baclofen, unlike other drugs, may be effective in reducing both tonic and phasic rigidities at lower doses than those causing muscle relaxation in intact animals.", 
    "24": "We have characterized and quantified the specific binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam ( FNZ ) to thick (230 micron) slices of mouse brain. The binding site has the characteristics of a benzodiazepine receptor, i.e., binding of FNZ is reversible, stereospecific, saturable and of high affinity. Clonazepam, but not R05 -4864, readily displaces the label. In contrast to results from homogenate assays, neither GABA nor bicuculline has any effect on [3H]- FNZ binding. However, as previously reported, the slice assay confirms the lower number of benzodiazepine receptors in \"emotional\" mouse brain. In addition, we have confirmed that the neurotoxin DSP4 can modify [3H]- FNZ binding though in our hands this compound elevates rather than reduces binding. The speed, simplicity and minimal tissue preparation involved suggests that this slice assay could be a valuable addition to neurochemical studies of neurotransmitter receptors.", 
    "25": "POR 8 (ornipressin) at a concentration of 5 IU in 10 ml of 1% lidocaine was used as a local vasoconstrictor in 262 ENT operations. Anaesthesia was carried out with either halothane or enflurane, or with diazepam and fentanyl. The doses of POR 8 lay between 2.7 IU and 3.5 IU. Under inhalational anaesthesia there was a good vasoconstriction in 85% to 90%, and anaesthesia with diazepam-fentanyl in 60% to 83% of cases, depending on the site of operation. There should be a 10-20 minute interval between infiltration and the beginning of surgery. Under inhalational anaesthesia the systolic blood pressure fell by 10% after infiltration of POR 8, when the diastolic blood pressure rose by 6%. During diazepam-fentanyl anaesthesia the systolic blood pressure increased by 23%, the diastolic by 27%. POR 8 was not found to have an antidiuretic effect. There was no difference between the osmolality, sodium and potassium levels of 30 patients measured before infiltration and 24 hours later. Because of the minimal side effects of POR 8 on the cardiovascular system during inhalational anaesthesia we recommend the use of these substance as a local vasoconstrictor instead of epinephrine.", 
    "26": "Thirty-four patients were allocated at random to treatment with 1 mg of flunitrazepam, orally, the night before operation, and 1 mg on the morning of operation (Group 1), and another 34 to treatment with 100 mg of pentobarbital, orally, the night before operation, followed by intramuscular atropine (0.01 mg/kg)+pethidine (meperidine 1 mg/kg) on the morning of operation (Group 2). The patients in both groups slept equally well. As far as apprehension and excitement (= anxiolytic effect) just before induction of anaesthesia were concerned, oral flunitrazepam proved to be markedly better than i.m. atropine+pethidine. There were no significant differences in cardiovascular variables between the two groups. From the anaesthesiologist's point of view, atropine had beneficial antisecretory effects, but, from the patients point of view, it caused only a subjective unwanted effect (dry mouth). In our opinion, oral flunitrazepam is a useful alternative agent for routine premedication. However, when used without i.m. atropine, excessive salivary secretion in some patients may occur and be disturbing, especially during extubation.", 
    "27": "It has been demonstrated in experiments on F1 (CBA X C57BL/6) hybrid mice and random-bred white mice that daily administration of corazol (30 mg/kg) led to the development of pharmacological kindling. The kindling was marked by a statistically significant reduction in the convulsant dose (CD50) of corazol, picrotoxin, bicuculline and thiosemicarbazide. No substantial differences were discovered in the degree of seizures induced by strychnine in the \"kindling\" and control groups. It is assumed that the mechanisms of the corazol kindling are effected via impairment of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "28": "Benzodiazepine drugs have been reported to have antiatherosclerotic effects in rabbits and roosters and to alter the pattern of circulating lipoproteins in man. The mechanism(s) of these effects has not been elucidated. The studies presented here indicate that diazepam, the most widely used benzodiazepine, is an inhibitor of cholesterol esterification by ACAT in vitro in atheromatous rabbit aortas, in microsomes isolated from atheromatous rabbit aortas, and in normal rat aortas. Diazepam also inhibited LCAT in plasma from man, monkey, rabbit, and rat, in vitro. The ability of diazepam to inhibit these enzyme systems may offer insight into possible in vivo mechanisms of action against atherosclerosis and of lipoprotein modification.", 
    "29": "Eight dogs with a Dirofilaria immitis microfilaraemia predictive for a moderately severe post-diethylcarbamazine (DEC) reaction, and 6 dogs with a microfilarial density predictive for a severe, fatal or near-fatal, reaction were given 5 mg diazepam (Valium) by intramuscular injection followed, 30 minutes later, by an intramuscular injection of 5 mg/kg DEC. Diazepam completely, or almost completely, blocked the post-DEC adverse reaction in all dogs of both groups. However, 5 D. immitis-infected dogs given DEC immediately following the injection of diazepam all developed an adverse reaction of a degree of severity, as measured by clinical and haematological parameters, customary for their level of microfilaraemia.", 
    "30": "Neurophysiological investigations of a patient suffering from the stiff-man syndrome revealed that exteroceptive reflexes, in particular those elicited from the skin, were excessively enhanced. In contrast, no abnormalities were found within the monosynaptic reflex arc. Clomipramine injection severely aggravated the clinical symptoms whereas diazepam, clonidine, and tizanidine decreased both muscular stiffness and abnormal exteroceptive reflexes. The hypothesis is put forward that the stiff-man syndrome is a disorder of descending brain-stem systems which exert a net inhibitory control on axial and limb girdle muscle tone as well as on exteroceptive reflex transmission. Detection of abnormal exteroceptive reflex activity in conjunction with neuropharmacological testing might help in the diagnosis of this rare disease.", 
    "31": "The effects of oral midazolam or intramuscular atropine and pethidine used as premedication in two groups of 35 children over 5 years of age were studied. There was some evidence that the anxiolytic effect of midazolam was rather better than that of atropine plus pethidine, but, in other respects, subjective assessments in the two patient groups were similar. Intramuscular atropine caused tachycardia and subjective side-effects, nevertheless children appear to require anticholinergics during premedication because of excessive salivary secretion, especially during extubation. Oral midazolam is a new anxiolytic drug which can be used as an alternative to existing premedicant drugs, but, in children, it should still be combined with an anticholinergic agent. No correlation between serum levels of midazolam or atropine and their clinical effects was found.", 
    "32": "A series of 2-phenyl- and 2-amino-4-aryl-4,5-dihydro-3H-1,3-benzodiazepines was prepared and submitted for broad biological screening, including evaluation for potential antihypertensive activity. Compound 4a [(+/-)-4,5-dihydro-2,4-diphenyl-3-methyl-3H-1,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride] was the most active member of the series in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, producing a 56 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure at an oral screening dose of 50 mg/kg. The synthesis of 4a analogues containing nuclear substituents in the 4-phenyl moiety resulted in a marked decrease of antihypertensive activity. It was not possible to improve on the antihypertensive properties of 4a through further synthetic modifications.", 
    "33": "Eight young women taking oral contraceptives and 10 young men each received three different doses of diazepam, 0.07, 0.14, and 0.28 mg/kg. The women also received each dose both on days 10 and 28 of an oral contraceptive cycle. Performance based on both a psychomotor and cognitive-encoding task was significantly impaired after a 0.28-mg/kg dose of diazepam in women taking oral contraceptives and in men. In general, however, impairment in performance was less on day 10 than on day 28 of the oral contraceptive cycle. The onset of behavioral impairment was also slower on cycle day 10 than on day 28; peak impairment was reached at 20 min after dosing for men and women on day 28, but at 60 min for women on day 10. The cycle phase effects are potentially dangerous because of their unexpected nature. Individuals may obtain an expectation of intoxication based on the 21-day OC period yet experience capriciously greater acute impairment during their 7-day menstrual pause.", 
    "34": "Clonazepam protein binding was investigated in sera from five different umbilical cords, 45 children (aged 2 mo to 12 yr), and five adults (aged 27 to 40 yr). The unbound fraction (means +/- SE) of clonazepam was 17.3% +/- 0.7% in umbilical cord serum and 13.9% +/- 0.2% in adult serum (P less than 0.01). In children, the unbound fraction of clonazepam reached the adult values during the first year of life. The kinetics of clonazepam serum protein binding were studied in three umbilical cord serum and three adult serum specimens. The number of binding sites (n, reported as moles per gram protein) and the association constant (K, reported as M-1) were estimated from double reciprocal plots of 1/r against 1/D (r is the number of moles bound per gram plasma protein; D is the molar concentration of unbound drug). In umbilical cord sera, the mean values (+/- SE) of n and K were 8.4 +/- 0.6 X 10(-7) mol/gm and 8.3 +/- 0.9 X 10(4) M-1. In adult serum samples the corresponding values were 3.0 +/- 0.8 X 10(-7) mol/gm and 2.7 +/- 0.6 X 10(5) M-1, which indicated lower binding capacity but higher affinity for clonazepam of plasma proteins in adults than in children.", 
    "35": "Choreoballismus, developing subacutely in a 48-year-old man, is reported for the first time as a complication of a cerebral venous angioma, demonstrated by computed tomography scanning and angiography. There was no apparent hemorrhage or mass effect from the angioma, which was located in the right caudate nucleus. The movement disorder, which did not respond to haloperidol alone, disappeared after the addition of clonazepam. The necessity for dual therapy implies that there was a disorder of more than one neurotransmitter system in this patient. The clinical and pathological features of these unusual vascular malformations are reviewed.", 
    "36": "The recording of visual evoked potentials in rabbits has been shown to be an objective, reproducible, noninvasive technique for quantitating changes in the pattern of cerebral neuronal activity. The development of hepatic encephalopathy due to galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure was consistently associated with a series of distinctive changes in the visual evoked potential waveform. The pattern of the visual evoked potential in hepatic coma (due to galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure) differed fundamentally from that in ether-induced coma, but was identical to that in comas induced by three drugs which activate gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neural mechanisms: pentobarbital, diazepam, and muscimol. These findings are compatible with activation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitory neurotransmitter system contributing to cerebral neuronal inhibition in hepatic coma due to galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure.", 
    "37": "The relationship between diazepam and breast cancer was evaluated using data from a case-control study of breast cancer, in which 1075 cases and 1146 controls who were participants in a breast cancer screening program were interviewed. Diazepam use was negatively associated with extent of disease and lymph node involvement, and this effect seemed greatest for long-term users of diazepam. It is not certain to what extent these data reflect an ascertainment bias, an association with the reasons for which the drug was prescribed, or chance. Whatever the explanation, the findings do not support a previous contention that diazepam promotes or accelerates breast cancer growth.", 
    "38": "We studied a patient with action-induced rhythmic dystonia that followed a stroke. Postmortem studies showed an infarct in the right posterolateral ventral part of the thalamus. Electrophysiologic analysis indicated that the eliciting factor of the involuntary movement was an impulse, promoting voluntary contraction of muscle. CSF 5-HIAA content was low, and HVA was high. Administration of 5-HTP and clonazepam abolished the involuntary movements.", 
    "39": "Intravenous diazepam is commonly used in clinical dentistry to produce sedation for dental procedures. Its chief benefit seems to derive from its sedative and amnesic properties. The literature contains conflicting reports about the direct analgesic effects of the drug. In the present study, we observed significant increases for conventional pain threshold measures in response to electric tooth pulp stimulation and decreased sensitivity to a fixed painful stimulus when diazepam was administered intravenously using clinical criteria for conscious sedative dosages. The data support the possibility that intravenously administered diazepam in conscious sedative doses may have some analgesic action in addition to its better documented sedative and amnesic properties.", 
    "40": "Structures of chicamycins A and B have been determined from a series of chemical degradation studies coupled with spectroscopic analysis. Chicamycin A is 2(S),11(R), 11a (S)-1,2,3,10, 11, 11a -hexahydro-2,8-dihydroxy-7,11-dimethoxy-5H-pyrrolo-[2,1-c] [1,4]-benzodiazepin-5-one, and chicamycin B is 2(S), 11a (S)-1,2,3, 11a -tetrahydro-2,8-dihydroxy-7 -methoxy-5H-pyrrolo-[2,1-c][1,4]-benzodiazepin-5-one which is the demethanol form of chicamycin A. The structure of chicamycin B is closely related to that of neothramycin , differing only in the position of a hydroxyl substituent on the pyrrolidine ring.", 
    "41": "Chicamycin is a new antitumor antibiotic produced by a strain of Streptomyces albus, No. J576 -99. The antibiotic is extractable into organic solvents from the fermentation broth and is obtained in two active forms, chicamycins A and B, depending upon the isolation procedure used. Chicamycin A is not a natural antibiotic but the methanol adduct of naturally produced chicamycin B. Both forms of the antibiotic have weak antibacterial activity against some Gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria. They inhibit the growth of experimental tumors such as P388 mouse leukemia.", 
    "42": "The properties of [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate ( [3H]QNB) binding and [3H]pirenzepine ( [3H]PZ) binding to various regions of rat brain were compared. [3H]PZ appeared to bind with high affinity to a single site, with a Kd value of approximately 15 nM in the cerebral cortex. The rank order of potencies of muscarinic drugs to inhibit binding of either [3H]QNB or [3H]PZ was QNB greater than atropine = scopolamine greater than pirenzepine greater than oxotremorine greater than bethanechol. Muscarinic antagonists (except PZ) inhibited both [3H]PZ and [3H]QNB binding with Hill coefficients of approximately 1. PZ inhibited [3H]QNB binding in cortex with a Hill coefficient of 0.7, but inhibited [3H]PZ binding with a Hill coefficient of 1.0. Hill coefficients for agonists were less than 1. The density of [3H]PZ binding sites was approximately half the density of [3H]QNB binding sites in cortex, striatum and hippocampus. In pons-medulla and cerebellum, the densities of [3H]PZ binding sites were 20 and 0%, respectively, relative to the densities of [3H]QNB binding sites. When unlabeled PZ was used to compete for [3H]QNB binding, the relative number of high-affinity PZ binding sites in cortex, pons and cerebellum agreed with the relative number of [3H]PZ binding sites in those regions. The binding of [3H]PZ and [3H]QNB was nonadditive in cortex. GTP inhibited high-affinity oxotremorine binding, but not PZ binding. Together, these data suggest that [3H]PZ binds to a subset of [3H]QNB binding sites. Whether this subset reflects the existence of subtypes of muscarinic receptors or is a consequence of coupling to another membrane protein remains to be seen.", 
    "43": "Eighteen patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer were given 36 courses of cis-platinum-containing chemotherapy at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Patients were given lorazepam (Ativan) prior to chemotherapy. Amnesia for the day of chemotherapy was reported in 29 courses. Lack of recall for the chemotherapy infusion and the subsequent 8 hr or greater was reported in 33 of the 36 courses. In two courses, no amnesia effects were noted. No serious side effects of lorazepam therapy occurred and all patients believed that the amnesic effect was beneficial during chemotherapy. Lorazepam (Ativan) appears to be a safe medication to induce amnesia for cis-platinum chemotherapy and deserves further study to determine its effect on anticipatory vomiting, nausea and vomiting, and patient compliance with continued chemotherapy.", 
    "44": "The Wyeth company has developed a new vehicle for drugs allowing the immediate dissolving of the medication in contact with the saliva. A double-blind test with oxazepam confirms the value of this new vehicle. Moreover, contrarily to our fears, it also confirms that such dispensing had no secondary effects on the alimentary tract.", 
    "45": "Methadone maintenance patients who maintained on a high daily dose were divided into good performers and poor performers based on whether they demonstrated persistent use of heroin, non-prescription diazepam, and/or excessive alcohol consumption. Mean methadone plasma levels 24 hours after an oral dose of 80 mg were found to be 410.4 ng/ml in good performers compared to 101.8 ng/ml in poor performers (P less than .05). Seven of nine (77.8%) poor compared to two of 15 (13.3%) good performers had 24-hour methadone plasma levels under 50 ng/ml (P less than .01). High dose methadone patients who show evidence of persistent drug or alcohol abuse should have their 24-hour methadone plasma level determined to help assess whether the patient should receive more methadone or find an alternative treatment.", 
    "46": "Within the framework of a large-scale clinical study on the effect of diazepam in chronic anxiety, diazepam (D) and desmethyldiazepam (DD) plasma concentrations were determined frequently. Significant relationships were found between the clinical effect and the plasma concentrations of D and DD, respectively; a curvilinear relationship resulted if the dosage was disregarded, but within the individual dosage groups the relationship was found to be linear. For these computations, the daily diazepam dose was treated as a covariable in a factorial analysis of variance approach. It was found, in addition, that the daily diazepam dose was one of the most significant predictors of the plasma concentration of D or DD, respectively. The steady state plasma concentrations were highest in patients experiencing an exacerbation of their conditions of anxiety if they were returned to placebo after 14 to 22 weeks of diazepam medication. The lowest steady state concentrations were found with those patients who showed withdrawal symptoms under these conditions.", 
    "47": "The cat has been used extensively as an experimental model for studying the pharmacology of compounds that exhibit CNS activity including diazepam and nordiazepam. However, since little is known about the distribution and elimination of diazepam in this species, the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and nordiazepam were studied in the cat following intravenous doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of diazepam and 5 and 10 mg/kg of nordiazepam. The disappearance of diazepam and nordiazepam from blood was fitted with classical equations. Theoretical and trapezoidal areas under the curve (AUCth and AUCtr) were calculated. The volumes of distribution (Vd beta) were calculated as model-independent parameters for diazepam and nordiazepam. Intrinsic hepatic clearance, extraction ratio, and tissue binding parameters were also calculated for diazepam. From the observed data, it is apparent that the blood concentrations and the resulting areas under the curves are proportional to the dose of diazepam administered and that the pharmacokinetics of diazepam were linear over the dose range studied. In addition, nordiazepam formed after diazepam administration appeared to be proportional to the dose of diazepam administered. The terminal elimination rate constant of nordiazepam remained constant over the dose range studied. It appears that both diazepam and nordiazepam are highly bound to tissue. The total body clearance of diazepam (4.72 +/- 2.45 mL/min/kg) is approximately six times that of nordiazepam (0.85 +/- 0.25 mL/min/kg). Approximately 50% of an administered dose of diazepam was biotransformed to nordiazepam in the cat.", 
    "48": "The clinical anticonvulsant efficacy of single dose rectal and oral administration of diazepam 20 mg was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled trials in adult epileptic patients. All subjects suffered from drug resistant epilepsy and frequently experienced serial seizures. Diazepam was administered rectally as a new experimental suppository formulation immediately after a seizure and was highly effective in preventing recurrent fits within a 24 h observation period (p less than 0.001). Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a wide range of serum diazepam concentrations 60 min after administration of the suppository (mean serum diazepam level 190 +/- 73 (SD ng/ml). In a similar study oral administration of diazepam 20 mg significantly reduced the incidence of serial seizures compared with a placebo (p less than 0.01) and the mean 60 min serum diazepam level was 273 +/- 190 (SD) ng/ml.", 
    "49": "The response to diazepam and propranolol hydrochloride was compared in 21 patients who (with one exception) met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Each drug was administered for two weeks in double-blind fashion according to a crossover design. The response to diazepam was significantly superior on all measures. By observer rating, 18 patients showed at least moderate improvement with diazepam compared with seven receiving propranolol. Panic attacks and phobic symptoms responded to diazepam, but not to propranolol. The results suggest that benzodiazepines constitute effective short-term treatment for these newly defined disorders.", 
    "50": "Using male hooded Lister rats the effects of GABAergic and serotonergic treatments alone and with chlordiazepoxide (CDP) were compared with the behavioral effects of CDP in a conditioned conflict procedure with three components; Reward, Time Out, and Conflict. CDP (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg ip) dose- relatedly increased punished and time out responding, but increased rewarded responding in an inversely dose-related manner. Punished responding was enhanced by chronic treatment to a rate which remained stable between 9 and 19 injections. The GABA transaminase inhibitor ethanolamine-O-sulfate (EOS), given chronically in drinking water (5.0 mg/ml), increased punished responding linearly to a high stable level after 2-3 weeks. Rewarded and time out responding were less substantially increased. CDP given with EOS dose- relatedly increased time out and punished responding substantially above the rates found with either treatment alone. The GABA antagonist picrotoxin blocked the increase in punished and time out responding found with EOS and CDP alone. The tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 100 mg/kg x 3) linearly increased punished responding for the first week of treatment. CDP with PCPA selectively and significantly increased punished responding above the rates for either treatment alone, but the increases were not as substantial as those with EOS + CDP. The serotonin reuptake inhibitor Wy 25093 reduced increases in time out and punished responding under CDP, and the precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) counteracted increases in punished responding under PCPA but also substantially reduced rewarded responding. These results provide evidence that both increased GABA and decreased serotonin transmission are involved in the anticonflict effects of CDP, as EOS and PCPA both mimicked and potentiated effects of CDP, while picrotoxin, Wy 25093, and 5-HTP counteracted them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The kinetic characteristics of binding of [3H]-GABA and the pattern of isoniazid-induced convulsions were studied in rats treated with repeated intraventricular injections of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) (10 micrograms/rat, twice daily for 8 days). Thirty-six hours after the last injection, the total number of binding sites for [3H]-GABA was decreased (25%) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the dissociation constant (KD) between beta-CCE and solvent-treated rats. The decrease in binding sites for [3H]-GABA was paralleled by a strong potentiation of the convulsant pattern elicited by isoniazid. The results suggest that the proconvulsant effect elicited by beta-CCE is mediated by the decrease in the total number of binding sites for GABA, secondary to the interaction between beta-CCE and the benzodiazepine receptor coupled to the GABA receptor.", 
    "52": "The behaviour of male adolescent rats was studied after neonatal administration of CGS 8216 (2.5 or 10 mg/kg/day). The pups were cross-fostered, and drug treatment (in a split-litter design) lasted from postnatal day 7 to day 28; behavioural tests began on day 31. In the social interaction test, neonatally-treated adolescents displayed an unusual profile of behaviour that was the opposite to the profile caused by acute CGS 8216 in adults. Their response to challenge doses of CGS 8216 was not significantly different from that of neonatal controls. In the holeboard test of exploratory behaviour, there was little sign of effects of the neonatal treatment, and the response to challenge doses of Ro 15-1788 or chlordiazepoxide was not differentially affected. However, neonatally-treated animals were less sensitive to the convulsant effects of pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin. Lasting effects of neonatal CGS 8216 have been detected in adults; the effects seen in adolescents appear not to be identical, since a proconvulsant effect occurs in adults.", 
    "53": "The relationship of the structure of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 45 related compounds to their binding with the GABA and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors was investigated. In the course of evaluating the cross-reactivity of the 45 GABA-related compounds in a GABA radioreceptor assay (GABA-RRA) using [3H]GABA and rat brain synaptic membranes, it became clear that for the molecule to react with GABA-receptors the amino group must be free, but that the carboxy group is not essential. It was also demonstrated that the molecule lost its cross-reactivity if the distance between the alpha-carbon and the amino group exceeded a certain limit, and, additionally, that the cross-reacting potency depended on the stereospecificity of the compound. When the cross-reactivity of GABA related compounds with the GABA receptor was compared with their enhancement of BDZ receptor affinity, a parallelism was found between the two actions. Between d-gamma-amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (d-GABOB) and 1-GABOB, however, no difference was found in the BDZ receptor affinity-enhancing effect, although there was a large difference in the cross-reactivity in the GABA-RRA. This indicates that the stereospecificity of the beta-carbon is crucial for the binding of the molecule to the GABA receptor but not essential for its binding to the BDZ receptor, suggesting that the GABA receptor and the BDZ receptor each recognize a different site of the molecule.", 
    "54": "Muscarinic cholinergic and benzodiazepine receptor affinities and densities were evaluated in membranes from seven brain regions of rats intravenously self-administering morphine and in littermates receiving yoked-morphine or yoked vehicle infusions to identify neuronal systems potentially involved in mediating opiate reinforcement processes. Passive morphine infusion resulted in increases in muscarinic cholinergic receptor densities in the pyriform cortex and in decreases in the cingulate cortex while benzodiazepine receptor densities were decreased in both the hippocampal formation and entorhinal-subicular cortex compared to littermates receiving passive infusions of vehicle. Morphine self-administration resulted in decreased muscarinic cholinergic receptor densities in the frontal and entorhinal-subicular cortices and increases in the amygdaloid complex compared to littermates receiving yoked passive drug. These data are in agreement with acetylcholine turnover rate measurements in these animals and support the proposed role of cholinergic innervations of the frontal and entorhinal-subicular cortices and amygdaloid complex in opiate reinforcement processes.", 
    "55": "The ability of calcium channel blockers to displace the binding of benzodiazepine ligands was investigated in rat heart, kidney, and brain. The dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers nifedipine and nitrendipine displaced the binding of the non-neuronal-site ligand [3H]Ro5-4864, but not that of the neuronal-site ligands [3H]flurazepam or [3H]clonazepam. The inhibition was competitive, with Ki values in the micromolar range. Other calcium channel blockers--i.e., verapamil and diltiazem--were inactive at both sites. Thus, non-neuronal benzodiazepines bind to a class of sites that also binds dihydropyridines. This implies a role for benzodiazepines in the mediation of calcium-dependent phenomena.", 
    "56": "When vascular access is delayed or unreliable in emergency situations, an endotracheal tube provides a rapid and reliable route for administration of medication. Epinephrine, lidocaine, and atropine have shown clinical efficacy when given by the endotracheal route. There is evidence that other medications including naloxone and diazepam may also be suitable for endotracheal use, but clear-cut recommendations await further studies of pharmacokinetics and toxicity.", 
    "57": "Severe head injury often produces complex intracranial displacements of the brain, resulting in widespread, often microscopic lesions. These are responsible for two types of edema: vasogenic edema, with outflow of molecules and fluid into the extracellular spaces by rupture of the blood-brain barrier and vasoplegia, and cytotoxic edema, with swelling of astrocytes due to membrane lesions. The connexions between these two types of edema are still obscure. Alterations in membrane phospholipids may impede function of Na-K pump enzymes, causing accumulation of water in the cell. Cerebral edema is responsible for intracranial hypertension and tentorial herniation, which in turn increase edema through venous compression, ischemia, and hypoxia. The least controversial anti-edema therapeutic measures include relative fluid and salt restriction, mannitol if called for, neuroplegia, in particular with diazepam and Gamma-OH, and assisted ventilation.", 
    "58": "Benzodiazepines exert most of their pharmacological effects by a selective facilitation of the postsynaptic actions of GABA. Clinical, behavioural and electrophysiological studies have shown reduced drug response following chronic benzodiazepine administration. We present here electrophysiological evidence for decreased postsynaptic sensitivity to GABA following chronic benzodiazepine administration as measured by the direct iontophoretic application of GABA and serotonin onto serotonergic cells in the midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), known to receive GABAergic input. The subsensitivity to GABA was found to be dose dependent and was seen when diazepam administration was three weeks or longer. Further, acute injection of the specific benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro15-1788, was found to reverse rapidly the decrease in GABA sensitivity observed in chronically diazepam-treated animals without altering GABA sensitivity in vehicle-treated rats. Decreased response to chronic benzodiazepines does not appear to be consistently related to alterations in the number or affinity of receptors for benzodiazepines. Our studies of radioligand-binding showed a decrease in the ability of GABA to enhance benzodiazepine binding in cerebral cortical membranes from chronic diazepam-treated animals without significant changes in benzodiazepine binding site density or affinity.", 
    "59": "The anthelmintic macrolide, ivermectin, enhances the binding of benzodiazepine agonist ( [3H]-diazepam) and antagonist ( [3H] beta-carboline ethyl ester) ligands to rat cortical and cerebellar membrane preparations. Enhancement of benzodiazepine agonist binding is partially additive with that of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and is inhibited by etazolate, bicuculline, and the steroid GABA antagonist R5135. Ivermectin-stimulated benzodiazepine antagonist binding is enhanced by bicuculline and inhibited by GABA and etazolate. The modulatory effects of bicuculline are chloride-dependent. The stimulatory effects of ivermectin, while quantitatively different in cortex and cerebellum, are qualitatively similar in both brain regions and are reduced in the presence of chloride. Ivermectin effects on benzodiazepine ligand binding to the benzodiazepine receptor complex and the differences in the effects of GABA, bicuculline, and R5135 on ivermectin-stimulated agonist and antagonist binding may provide evidence for distinct differences in the recognition sites for the two classes of benzodiazepine receptor ligand and their interactions with other components of the receptor complex.", 
    "60": "A window discrimination method is presented for the continuous monitoring of sleep-wakefulness cycles in cats. Window discrimination permits the recording of the frequency of firing of multiple units, while filtering out movement artifacts and low-level noise. Records of reticular formation multiple unit activity (MUA) and EMG from cats with chronically implanted electrodes were quantified by window discrimination and displayed on a strip chart recorder. The frequency of firing of large reticular multiple units was highest in states of high CNS excitation (i.e., REM), and the lowest in states of low CNS excitation (i.e., SWS). Comparison of recording of reticular MUA by window discrimination and rectification-integration indicated that sleep-wakefulness states were more easily distinguished with the former method. The effects of flurazepam, 1.25-5 mg/kg i.p., and triazolam, 0.01-0.05 mg/kg i.p., on reticular MUA were observed for 24-72 h of continuous recording. Both benzodiazepines depressed reticular MUA by up to 50% in a dose-related fashion. Flurazepam was effective for 72 h or more, and triazolam for 24-48 h. Flurazepam was also much longer lasting than triazolam when administered for 3 days at 24 h intervals. As evidence by our evaluation of flurazepam and triazolam, it appears that evaluation of the effects of sedative-hypnotics on the CNS excitation level of the cat, and the duration of these effects, can be readily performed and these results generalized to the clinical experience. This should prove useful in the evaluation of novel sedative-hypnotics.", 
    "61": "The laboratories reported data on CPDD 1 that was indeed very similar to that of their direct or historical controls for diazepam. It is clear that the antagonists used in the program will reverse only a benzodiazepine-induced behavioral effect. The data on bromazepam suggest a very similar pattern and potency for this benzodiazepine compared to diazepam.", 
    "62": "Cimetidine (CIM) was used as an interacting agent on the disposition in dogs of dipotassium clorazepate ( CZP ) and its main metabolite nordiazepam (ND) in order to study some of the factors contributing to pharmacokinetic interspecies variation of benzodiazepines in dogs and man. A 0.5 mg/kg of body weight intravenous (i.v.) bolus dose of CZP was administered to 12 anesthetized mongrel dogs, 6 of them receiving also, 30 min before, a 1 mg/kg i.v. bolus dose of CIM followed by a constant i.v. infusion (1 mg/kg/hr) of CIM. Plasma ND and CZP concentrations were measured as a function of time with an high-performance liquid chromatography method. Plasma levels of CZP declined mono- and biexponentially in 1 and 5 dogs, respectively, for each group of animals. No statistically significant difference was found between CZP pharmacokinetic parameters when the 2 groups of dogs were compared. However, a 37% decrease in ND beta half-life, t1/2 beta, when CZP was associated with CIM, was found to be statistically significant. The i.v. administration of pure ND in two dogs, has shown that ND declines biexponentially with a t1/2 beta similar to the one estimated after CZP dosing in control animals. The hepatic metabolism of ND was found to be flow-independent and restrictive. The data, along with previously reported CIM interactions, suggest that several factors, which would be species-dependent, must be responsible of CIM effect on other drugs.", 
    "63": "Neuropharmacologic agents may be more teratogenic to human beings by perturbing neurotransmitter mechanisms that regulate embryonic development. There is evidence that neurotransmitters function in mouse palate development: Serotonin and acetylcholine stimulate and GABA inhibits shelf reorientation. Both serotonin and GABA have been measured in the palate and uptake systems monitored. Serotonin stimulates cell motility, protein carboxyl methylation, and cyclic GMP. Diazepam (Valium) could cause cleft palate by mimicking GABA. Genetic differences in both diazepam teratogenesis and in a GABAergic system of the mouse have been observed. If human beings were to show genetic differences in a GABAergic system, some pregnant women could be at high risk when treated with diazepam.", 
    "64": "We report three cases of fatal hyperthermia in the course of neuroleptic drug treatment. One patient developed his symptoms within hours after a single drug dose whereas the two others had a prolonged symptomatology which lasted for several days after the administration of different neuroleptic drugs. Biochemical events included diffuse intravascular coagulation, muscle cell necrosis and acute renal failure. Rhabdomyolysis was proved pathologically in two patients but brain lesions were atypical in all three cases. We conclude that the biochemical and pathological abnormalities seen in these patients are those which have been described by some authors in the malignant hyperthermia syndrome after anaesthesia. The symptomatology however can be insidious and the syndrome can develop after withdrawal of the drugs.", 
    "65": "Sixteen healthy volunteers of a mean age of means = 26.4 years took part in a driving simulator test in an eightfold crossover study under double-blind conditions. The additional influence of alcohol was tested acutely after a single administration of 2 mg lormetazepam, a new, highly effective derivative from the benzodiazepine class, 10 mg mepindolol sulphate, a new betablocker without sedating properties, and 10 mg diazepam. All drugs were compared with placebo and the test was performed 1, 2 and 3 hours after oral intake. The aim was to investigate particularly the risks relevant in road traffic caused by simultaneous intake of these substances with alcohol. For this purpose, besides the driving simulator, an accurate reaction test ( WDG ) and self-rating scales were used, the latter in order to assess subjective stress and anxiety levels. Lormetazepam, due to its strong sedating property, showed a reduction in driving performance and an increase in reaction time and pulse rate as compared with placebo, and these effects were highly potentiated by alcohol. Mepindolol sulphate expectedly reduced pulse rate when compared with placebo, otherwise there were no significant differences. Diazepam, when compared with placebo, like lormetazepam caused a reduction in driving performance and reaction capacity and an increase in pulse rate, but intensity and duration of this effect were less than with lormetazepam and did not reach statistical significance. No significant potentiating effects were observed after the additional application of alcohol.", 
    "66": "The effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines with various heterocyclic ring structures (triazolo, triazino and imidazo), and of 1,4-benzodiazepines with chlorine substitution in the phenyl ring (4'- chlorodiazepam , 2'- chlorodiazepam and 2'- chloronordiazepam ) were studied on spatial-delayed alternation and delayed matching-to-sample tasks in the monkey. Within the dose range 0.25-0.75 mg kg-1, the triazolo compounds had marked activity, decreasing the number of correct responses and increasing total response time. The triazino was less potent and the imidazo compounds were the least likely to disrupt performance. Smaller doses (0.005, 0.01 and 0.05 mg kg-1) of triazolam did not impair performance on the tasks, and larger doses of imidazo (1.0, 3.0 and 7.5 mg kg-1) were without effect on delayed alternation. Within the dose range 1.0-10.0 mg kg-1, 4'- chlorodiazepam was without effect and only the largest dose of diazepam and 2'- chlorodiazepam impaired performance. 2'- Chloronordiazepam decreased the number of correct responses at all doses (1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1) and with the largest dose, the total response time was increased. The studies suggest that the effects of a drug on higher nervous function in the monkey cannot easily be predicted from standard pharmacological tests in other animals or other species of monkey.", 
    "67": "The hindered rotation about the exocyclic amide bond of pirenzepine has been studied using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ratios of the two slowly interconverting conformations (1:1.76 at 2 degrees C and 1:2.37 at 30 degrees C) and the rate of interconversion (1 +/- 0.5 s-1 at 20 degrees C and 247 +/- 20 s-1 at 80 degrees C with delta g ++80 = 71 KJ mol-1) have been measured at various temperatures. The observed rapid rates of interconversion allow us to eliminate the rate of conformational selection of forms II and III as a major contributor to the slow phase of the binding kinetics observed when pirenzepine binds to muscarinic receptors from rat brain (Stockton, Birdsall, Hulme and Burgen, unpublished results).", 
    "68": "Electrical stimulation (ES) of the nucleus amygdaloideus centralis ( NAmC ) and basolateralis ( NAmBL ), like norepinephrine, decreased mucosal blood flow of the gastric antrum and duodenum and decreased antral motility amplitude in gallamine-immobilized cats. ES of the nucleus lateralis hypothalami (NHL) less extensively produced a similar action. The NAmC stimulation elevated BP and renal sympathetic discharges, whereas the NAmBL stimulation lowered BP. These findings indicate that the gastric and pressor responses to the NAmC stimulation may be attributed to an increase in cerebral sympathetic outflow. Bromazepam dose-dependently (0.1 approximately 1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) prevented these gastric, pressor and renal sympathetic responses to the NAmC stimulation, but it did not alter the depressor response to the NAmBL stimulation or the norepinephrine-induced reactions. Bromazepam less extensively attenuated the gastric and pressor responses to the NHL stimulation. Moreover, bromazepam inhibited stress-induced gastric ulcer formation in rats more markedly than cimetidine, sulpiride and metoclopramide. Bromazepam markedly decreased stress-induced selective increase in the glucose utilization rate in the NAmC among various amygdala nuclei. These results indicate that effects of bromazepam on the gastric and pressor responses to the NAmC stimulation may be due to the inhibition of central sympathetic outflow, and the NAmC are more sensitive to bromazepam than the NHL and other amygdala nuclei."
