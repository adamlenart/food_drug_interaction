    "0": "Depression in schizophrenia may be partially responsible for the increased suicide rate in schizophrenic patients, which is more than 20 times higher than that found in the general population. Affective disorders in patients with schizophrenia are associated with a poor outcome, an increased risk of relapse, and a high rate of suicide. There is evidence that atypical antipsychotics may contribute to a reduction in suicidality, and although the new drugs are marketed for the treatment of schizophrenia, their novel psychopharmacologic effects suggest the possibility of other therapeutic applications. Recent studies of the efficacy of the novel antipsychotics found that these agents may produce an antidepressant effect in schizophrenia and may be used as either an adjunctive medication or an alternative to mood stabilizers in patients with affective disorders.", 
    "1": "The incidence of acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)--akathisia, dystonia, and parkinsonism--associated with traditional antipsychotics varies, but most researchers agree that neuroleptic-induced EPS occur in 50% to 75% of patients who take conventional antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics were developed to widen the therapeutic index and to reduce EPS. Although the mechanisms are unclear, the risk of EPS is less with the novel antipsychotics than with conventional drugs, and agents that produce low levels of acute EPS are likely to produce less tardive dyskinesia. Nevertheless, clinicians should exercise caution when comparing data from investigations of the novel antipsychotics and, until long-term data become available, should administer the new drugs at doses below the EPS-producing level.", 
    "2": "Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only). Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.", 
    "3": "The advent of the atypical antipsychotics marked a new era in the history of the treatment of psychotic disorders. To evaluate the published literature about the available atypical antipsychotics--clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine--and select the most appropriate treatment for specific patients, physicians need to understand the outcome measures used in clinical studies, the pharmacologic differences that explain varying side effect profiles, and pharmacoeconomic assessments that are used in the decision-making process. While the atypical antipsychotics have established efficacy in the overall treatment of schizophrenia, they may differ in their effects on factors such as cognitive function, overall quality of life, adverse events, and hospitalization status. Each of these factors should be considered when weighing treatment options for an individual patient.", 
    "4": "Neuroactive steroids are positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complexes. Synthetic modification generally does not increase neuroactive steroid potency beyond that of the naturally occurring progesterone metabolite, 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-P). Recently, it has been shown that introduction of appropriately para-substituted phenylethynyl groups at the 3beta-position of 5beta steroids increases receptor potency. The present report presents the synthesis and pharmacological profile of an analogous series of 5alpha steroids. The most striking feature of this series is the further enhancement of in vitro and in vivo potency obtained. In particular, 3beta-(p-acetylphenylethynyl)-3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pr egnan-20-one (Co 152791) was 11-, 16- and 49-fold more potent than 3alpha, 5alpha-P in modulating the binding of [35S]TBPS, [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol, respectively, in rat brain membranes (Co 152791 IC50 or EC50 = 2-7.5 nM). Similarly, Co 152791 was 3- to 20-fold more potent than 3alpha,5alpha-P as an inhibitor of [35S]TBPS binding in human recombinant receptor combinations containing alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 and beta2gamma2L subunits (Co 152791 IC50 1.4-5.7 nM). Co 152791 displayed low efficacy and 3alpha,5alpha-P had low potency at alpha4/6beta3gamma2L GABAA receptor complexes. Interestingly, Co 152791 demonstrated remarkable potency as a potentiator of GABA-evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha1beta2gamma2L receptors (EC50 0.87 nM), being 184-fold more potent than 3alpha,5alpha-P. High in vitro potency was also reflected in enhanced in vivo activity in that Co 152791 exhibited exceptional anticonvulsant potency, protecting mice from pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures at a approximately 5-fold lower dose than 3alpha,5alpha-P after i.p. administration (Co 152791 ED50 0.6 mg/kg). Moreover, Co 152791 was orally active (ED50 1.1 mg/kg) and exhibited a therapeutic index of 7 relative to rotorod impairment. The remarkable potency of Co 152791 as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors may be explained by its interaction with an auxiliary binding pocket in the neuroactive steroid binding site. In addition, modification at the 3beta-position probably hinders metabolism of the 3alpha-hydroxy group contributing to the exceptional anticonvulsant potency of this compound relative to other neuroactive steroids.", 
    "5": "Imidazenil, a benzodiazepine recognition site ligand that acts as partial positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action at GABAA receptors, inhibits in a dose-dependent manner (0.56-2.5 micromol/kg i.p. to rats) the cocaine-induced increase in dopamine (DA) content in the dialysates of the nucleus accumbens shell and striatum and also inhibits cocaine-induced locomotor activity. Diazepam, a full allosteric modulator of GABA action at GABAA receptors, in a dose of 4.4 micromol/kg i.p. also attenuates the cocaine-induced increase in DA content in the dialysates of nucleus accumbens shell, and striatum and the cocaine-induced locomotor activity. However, imidazenil (2.5 micromol/kg i.p.) fails to reduce spontaneous locomotor activity, whereas diazepam (4.4 micromol/kg i.p.) elicits sedation and ataxia and clearly impairs spontaneous locomotor activity. When added in vitro, both imidazenil and diazepam potentiate the GABA-mediated reduction of the ventral tegmental area DA neuron firing rate. After protracted treatment (14 days/three times a day with an increasing-dose schedule), the inhibitory actions of imidazenil fail to develop tolerance, whereas the actions of diazepam exhibit high tolerance liability. We conclude that imidazenil is devoid of tolerance liability and that, via a GABAA-mediated reduction in the extracellular DA in nucleus accumbens shell, it might reduce the psychomotor activity and reinforcing properties of cocaine.", 
    "6": "We studied the actions of Sch 50971, a novel histamine H3 receptor agonist, in an experimental neurogenic model of migraine and characterized its sedative and respiratory actions. Sch 50971 (i.v. and p.o) inhibited plasma protein extravasation in the dura mater of guinea pigs after electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglia. The minimum effective doses of Sch 50971 were 3.0 mg/kg i.v. and 10 mg/kg p.o., which produced a 40% and 42% decrease in plasma protein extravasation, respectively. The effects of Sch 50971 (3.0 mg/kg i.v. ) were blocked by the histamine H3 antagonist thioperamide (3.0 mg/kg i.v.). The 5-HT1D agonist, sumatriptan (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), and the histamine H3 agonist, (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (0.3 mg/kg), also inhibited plasma extravasation by 40 and 46%. In sedation studies, Sch 50971 (1-100 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated pentobarbital-induced sleep. The ED40 min for Sch 50971, the benzodiazepines triazolam and diazepam, the histamine H1 antagonist diphenhydramine and the H3 receptor agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine were 7.0, 0.5, 2.3, 14.1 and 23.4 mg/kg p. o., respectively. The sedative effects of oral Sch 50971 was blocked by thioperamide (10 microgram i.c.v.). The sedative activity of Sch 50971 was also examined using EEG activity, locomotor activity and sleep. In conscious guinea pigs, Sch 50971 (10 mg/kg p.o.) depressed locomotor activity, increased total sleep time and produced EEG patterns consistent with physiological sleep. Sch 50971 decreased beta wave activity but had no effects on delta wave activity, theta activity or alpha wave activity. In contrast, triazolam (1.0 mg/kg p. o.) depressed delta and theta wave activity and produced large increases in alpha and beta wave activity. In conclusion, Sch 50971 is an orally active, potent and selective agonist of histamine H3 receptors that may act to ameliorate the sequelae of migraine headaches, where activation of histamine H3 receptors may be beneficial. Sch 50971 also decreases motor activity and promotes EEG activity consistent with physiological sleep.", 
    "7": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of amnesia in preschool children on their later acceptance of dental care. Forty-six 4-6-year-old children, who between 2 and 4 years previously had had primary incisors extracted because of trauma, were reexamined for dental health and acceptance of dental care. The extractions had been performed under rectal sedation with diazepam (0.7 mg/kg body weight). Information about dental treatment and degree of cooperation during the intervening period was obtained from records at the referring clinic. The parents were interviewed about their child's experience of amnesia concerning the extractions, background variables, and experiences of dental care before the follow-up examination. Amnesia concerning the extractions was reported in 85% of the children. Twenty-nine percent had on some occasion exhibited behavior management problems (BMP) during the intervening period. Lack of amnesia was significantly associated with BMP (P< 0.002). Children without amnesia concerning the extractions tended to accept dental care less well at the reexamination. Parents were able to predict their child's acceptance of dental care at the follow-up with a significant degree of success (P= 0.02). In conclusion, amnesia in preschool children concerning extractions seems to be essential to facilitate positive acceptance of future dental care.",

    "17": "Benzodiazepines (BDs) have a widespread use among people suffering from anxiety. These drugs easily cross the placenta and may affect the developing embryo and fetus. The literature is divided as to whether BD may cause an increase in spontaneous abortions or congenital anomalies. From the years 1988 to 1996, 756 women called the Israeli TIS concerning exposures to BD prior to or during pregnancy. Of 599 women who called us during pregnancy, we have follow-up information on 460 pregnancies (76.6%). The incidence of congenital anomalies (3.1%) was not different from that found in 424 control pregnancies (2.6%). There was a significantly higher incidence of induced abortions (14.1% vs. 4.7%, P = 0.00) and of spontaneous abortions (8.7% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.01). From an examination of our results, it does not appear that BD during pregnancy caused an increase in the incidence of birth defects. There was no specific defect in the offspring. The increase in the rate of induced abortions is probably related to the counseling of the callers, and the increase in spontaneous abortions seems to be a result of the lower gestational age at the time of counseling in the women exposed to BD. It is unknown whether BD could be responsible for developmental or behavioral problems, which are observed only at a later stage.", 
    "18": "A mouse model for binge drinking has been developed in this laboratory, and several aspects of this model have been characterized. Many of the immunosuppressive effects of ethanol (EtOH) in this model seem to be mediated by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and consequent increases in the concentration of glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and perhaps other immunosuppressive mediators. The purpose of the work described here is to examine three important issues regarding the EtOH-induced neuroendocrine response in this model: 1) Are Ro15-4513-sensitive gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors involved in activation of the HPA axis by EtOH? 2) Does daily administration of EtOH produce tolerance with regard to activation of the HPA axis or with regard to suppression of natural killer cell activity? 3) Is the HPA axis activated by similar blood EtOH concentrations in humans and in the mouse model? Ro15-4513, a partial inverse agonist of GABA-A receptors, did not affect EtOH-induced increases in blood corticosterone levels. This suggests that Ro15-4513-sensitive GABA-A receptors are not involved in EtOH-induced activation of the HPA axis and that inhibition of corticosterone production is not the mechanism by which Ro-15-4513 blocks EtOH-induced immunosuppression. To evaluate tolerance, mice were given a daily dose of EtOH (6.5 g/kg by gavage) or vehicle (water) for 10 days. Control groups received vehicle or EtOH only on the last day of the experiment. At the optimum time after EtOH administration serum corticosterone and splenic NK cell activity were measured. The results indicate no significant alterations in the response to EtOH of mice exposed to EtOH for 10 days compared to those exposed only once. To compare the HPA axis response of mice and humans, lower EtOH dosages than generally used in our model were administered to mice, and the corticosterone response was compared to published data for humans who had similar ranges of blood EtOH levels. The results suggest that humans and mice exhibit activation of the HPA axis only when blood EtOH levels exceed approximately 0.14%. Together these results further characterize a mouse model for binge drinking that seems to provide a reasonable representation of many aspects of binge drinking in humans.",

Maximal stimulation (153 +/- 18% and 166 +/- 17% of control, p < 0.01) was achieved with 10 nM G17 and 100 nM G17-gly, respectively. These stimulations were fully prevented by the presence of 10 pM YM022, a G/CCK B receptor-antagonist, but unaffected by L364,718, a CCK A receptor-antagonist. Basal growth of LoVo cells was inhibited by YM022 and stimulated by L364,718. CCK A and G/CCK B receptors mRNA were detected in the cells. Gastrin immunoreactivity was detected in the cells (16 pM) and in the extracellular medium (4.5 pM).", 
    "25": "Both G17 and G17-gly stimulate LoVo cells growth through the activation of a gastrin/CCK B receptor. The evidence for secreted gastrin and CCK A and B receptors mRNA may further suggest the existence of an autocrine loop involving a stimulatory gastrin/CCK B receptor.", 
    "26": "Using patch clamp recording techniques in dentate granule cells (DGCs) isolated from patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy, we investigated basic properties of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) and pharmacological sensitivity of GABA-evoked currents to modulation by zinc and benzodiazepines (BZ). Properties of human DGC GABA(A)Rs were compared to DGC GABA(A)R properties in control and epileptic rats. Blockade of GABA evoked currents by zinc was significantly enhanced in epileptic human relative to control rat DGCs. Augmentation of the GABA(A)R current by the non-subunit selective BZ agonist, clonazepam (CNZ) and by the BZ1 specific agonist, zolpidem (ZOL), were not significantly different in human DGCs relative to control or epileptic rat. GABA potency was significantly higher in epileptic human DGCs than in control or epileptic rat DGCs. The significantly enhanced efficacy of zinc in blocking GABA currents in epileptic human DGCs mirrors that seen in epileptic rat DGCs, and was coupled with mossy fiber sprouting evident in both epileptic human and rat dentate gyrus. The aberrant mossy fibers provide a novel zinc delivery system within the epileptic dentate gyrus. The mossy fiber release of zinc onto DGCs coupled with the enhanced zinc sensitivity of GABA(A)Rs in epileptic DGCs, may lead to 'dynamic disinhibition' which could compromise inhibitory efficacy in the epileptic rat and human hippocampus.", 
    "27": "Parotid secretory and vascular responses to electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic innervation were measured in anaesthetized rats. Stimulation was performed at 1, 10 and 40 Hz. Atropine (1.5 micromol/kg i.v.) almost abolished the secretion to stimulation of peptide depleted nerves at 40 Hz, thus confirming the existence of a pure cholinergic response. Atropine also reduced secretion by 74% during stimulation of non-depleted nerves at the same frequency. Selective blockade by the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine and by the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine was found to occur at doses (50 nmol/kg i.v. and of 300 nmol/kg i.v., respectively) that did not inhibit the responses to exogenous acetylcholine. In the presence of methoctramine, the nerve-evoked fluid responses were increased by 200% at 1 Hz independently of the total number of impulses (10-300), suggesting that M2 receptor activation normally has an inhibitory effect on transmitter release. The magnitude of the increase was inversely related to frequency of stimulation, and changes in the secretory responses occurred at 40 Hz only when non-depleted nerves were stimulated over the longest period employed. The fluid response then increased by 35% and protein concentration by 200%. The vasodilator responses increased at 1 and 10 Hz, but not at 40 Hz. Pirenzepine reduced the secretory and vascular responses at 10 and 40 Hz but only during stimulation over short periods of time. This suggests that M1 receptor activation normally has a facilitatory effect on neurotransmitter release. During stimulation of non-depleted nerves at 10 Hz for 10 impulses, the fluid response was reduced by 29% and the protein concentration by 26%. When the peptide depleted nerves were stimulated at 10 Hz, pirenzepine also reduced the fluid response (by 43%), but not the protein concentration. It is concluded that the release of transmitter from postganglionic nerve fibres in the rat auriculotemporal nerve is modulated by presynaptic muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic M1 receptors normally facilitate cholinergic and peptidergic transmission during short, intense stimulation. On the other hand, muscarinic M2 receptors normally inhibit cholinergic transmission at low frequencies; at higher frequencies, peptidergic transmission is also inhibited, but only after some delay.", 
    "28": "We used the whole-cell recording technique in an in vitro preparation to examine the electrophysiological actions of the muscarinic receptors on relay cells in the rat lateral geniculate nucleus. Drop application of the muscarinic agonist acetyl-beta-methylcholine resulted in a slow depolarization that persisted for several minutes. The response was insensitive to the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium, but was blocked by atropine, a muscarinic antagonist. The response was also insensitive to blockade of synaptic transmission by tetrodotoxin, indicating a direct muscarinic effect. The muscarinic depolarization consisted of two components that were somewhat separated in time. The early portion of the muscarinic response was mediated by a large inward current with little change in input resistance, while the later portion was mediated by a small inward current associated with a large increase in input resistance. Pharmacological agents were used to distinguish the two components. Drop application of McN-A-343, an ml receptor agonist, could only mimic the later component of the muscarinic response. This was supported by the result that the later component was blocked by low concentrations of pirenzepine. These data suggest that the ml receptor only mediates the late component of the muscarinic response, while the early component is mainly mediated by the m3 receptor. The idea that both ml and m3 receptors were involved in the muscarinic depolarization was further supported by voltage-clamp analysis. This revealed that activation of the ml receptor was associated with a decrease in an inward potassium current, IKleak, while activation of the m3 receptor was likely associated with both a decrease in IKleak and an increase in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih. In summary, our data suggest that muscarinic responses in geniculate relay cells result from the activation of two receptors, which modulate IKleak and Ih. Given the fact that the ascending aminergic systems also depolarize geniculate relay cells via two receptors acting on IKleak and Ih, we concluded that ascending activating systems use common mechanisms to enact the depolarizing form of arousal in relay neurons.",

    "38": "The cerebellar granule cells of the spontaneous recessive mutant mouse strain, stargazer (stg/stg), fail to express brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA. This deficit is exclusive to these neurons and is believed to underlie the motor irregularities displayed by stg/stg, though the molecular basis for their phenotype has still to be resolved. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor has been shown to play a role in the postnatal maturation of cerebellar granule cells. Differentiation of these neurons, postnatally, is characterised by a switch in their GABAA receptor subunit expression profile. Notably, the GABAA receptor alpha6 subunit, which is specific to these neurons, becomes detectable at postnatal days 10-14 (P10-14). To determine whether cerebellar GABAA receptor expression has been compromised in stg/stg mice, the expression levels of GABAA receptor alpha1, alpha6, beta2 and beta3 subunits were compared between stg/stg mice and the appropriate wild-type background strain, C57BL/6J (+/+). By quantitative immunoblotting, it was found that the expression of the alpha6 and beta3 subunits was 23+/-8% and 38+/-12% (mean+/-S.E.M., n=6) of control (+/+) levels, respectively. In contrast, the expression of the alpha1 and beta2 subunits was not significantly different from controls, being 116+/-11% and 87+/-24% (mean+/-S.E.M., n=6) of +/+ levels, respectively. Total specific [3H]Ro15-4513 binding activity detected in cerebellar membranes prepared from stg/stg was not significantly different from +/+ mice. However, the benzodiazepine agonist-insensitive subtype of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding activity, a pharmacological motif of alpha6 subunit-containing GABAA receptors, was lower in stg/stg mice relative to the +/+ strain which correlated with the lowered level of alpha6 subunit expression. Thus, we have identified an abnormality in the GABAA receptor profile of stg/stg mutant mice that might underpin its irregular phenotype.", 
    "39": "Allosteric regulators of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors include 2,3-benzodiazepines such as GYKI 52466 and GYKI 53655 and the chaotropic anion thiocyanate that inhibit, and benzothiadiazines such as cyclothiazide that potentiate AMPA receptor currents. Here we sought to determine whether the allosteric regulators modulate AMPA receptors at a common or distinct allosteric sites by comparing their actions on AMPA- and kainate-evoked currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant AMPA receptor subunits. GYKI 52466 and thiocyanate blocked AMPA-evoked currents in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 values, 8.2 microM and 1.1 mM, respectively); in contrast, kainate-evoked currents were blocked by GYKI 52466, but were potentiated by high concentrations of thiocyanate (> or = 3 mM). Thiocyanate enhanced the rate of desensitization and slowed recovery from desensitization of AMPA-evoked currents, whereas GYKI 52466 failed to affect desensitization. Among neurons in the hippocampal cultures, there was cell-to-cell variability in the sensitivity to block of AMPA-evoked currents by thiocyanate that was correlated with the degree of potentiation by cyclothiazide. Moreover, cyclothiazide caused a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for thiocyanate block, and slowed the onset of thiocyanate block to a rate that was similar to that of cyclothiazide dissociation. Together, these observations suggest that thiocyanate and cyclothiazide act at non-distinct allosteric sites. GYKI 52466 blocked AMPA receptor responses to a similar extent, irrespective of the degree of cyclothiazide potentiation. Moreover, the kinetics of GYKI 53655 block in the presence of cyclothiazide were not consistent with a competitive interaction. As is the case for cyclothiazide, SCN- exhibited greater affinity for flip than for flop AMPA receptor splice variants. In particular, GluR1flip/GluR2flip was especially sensitive to thiocyanate block. We conclude that thiocyanate, a flip-preferring allosteric modulator like cyclothiazide, appears to act by enhancing desensitization at a site that may overlap the site where cyclothiazide reduces desensitization, whereas 2,3-benzodiazepines act at a distinct site and the block does not involve a modification of desensitization.", 
    "40": "The abundance of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA receptor) subunit mRNAs and polypeptides as well as muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake were measured in rat cerebral cortex or hippocampus at various times during pregnancy and after delivery. RNase protection assays revealed that the amount of the gamma2L subunit mRNA decreased progressively during pregnancy, in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and then returned to control values around the time of delivery. A similar pattern was observed for the alpha5 subunit mRNA in the cerebral cortex, whereas no significant changes were apparent for alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, beta1, beta2, beta3 and gamma2S subunit mRNAs. The amounts of gamma2 and alpha1 proteins in the cerebral cortex were measured by immunoblot analysis; whereas the abundance of gamma2 protein decreased during pregnancy, no change was detected in the amount of alpha1 protein. Evaluation for functional significance of the down-regulated gamma2 and alpha5 subunit was made by determining the GABAA receptor function assessed by measurement of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in cerebral cortical membrane vesicles. Muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake was markedly reduced during of pregnancy compared with rats in oestrus. At this same time, the potentiating effects of diazepam and allopregnanolone on muscimol stimulation of 36Cl- uptake also were reduced. In contrast, the effects of muscimol, allopregnanolone and diazepam were significantly increased, relative to animals in oestrus, after delivery.",

Patients' state of health (4-point scale) and medication tolerability (occurrence of adverse events) were documented. Using the following as parameters \"Alphabetischer Durchstreichtest, Feinmotoriktest, Befindlichkeitsskala, Beschwerdeliste, Schlaffrageb\u00f6gen A and B\" the differences between beginning and the end of the therapy were analyzed by simultaneous testing of the equality or superiority of the test preparation. The equivalence of both therapies according to sleep quality, fitness and quality of life was proven by a Mann-Whitney-Statistic of 0.50 with a lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval of 0.46. The patients' state of health improved during therapy while showing a deterioration after cessation with both preparations. Withdrawal symptoms, however, were documented with benzodiazepine. Only one adverse drug reaction was reported during this study, namely stomach complaints from both the test and reference medication. This study shows that the investigated hop-valerian preparation in the appropriate dose is a sensible alternative to benzodiazepine for the treatment of nonchronic and non-psychiatric sleep disorders.",

Smith, Progesterone withdrawal decreases latency to and increases duration of electrified prod burial: a possible rat model of PMS anxiety, Pharmacol. Biochem. 46 (1993) 897-904.] and seizure susceptibility [S.S. Smith, Q.H. Gong, F.-C. Hsu, R.S. Markowitz, J. M.H. ffrench-Mullen, X. Li, GABAA receptor alpha4 subunit suppression prevents withdrawal properties of an endogenous steroid, Nature 392 (1998) 926-930.] upon abrupt discontinuation after chronic administration of its parent compound, progesterone (P), in a manner similar to other GABA-modulatory drugs. Further, we have demonstrated that withdrawal from P produces insensitivity to the potentiating effects of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) lorazepam (LZM) on GABA-gated Cl- current [A.-M.N. Costa, K.T. Spence, S.S. Smith, J.M. H. ffrench-Mullen, Withdrawal from the endogenous steroid progesterone results in GABAA currents insensitive to BDZ modulation in rats CA1 hippocampus, J.

Li, GABAA receptor alpha4 subunit suppression prevents withdrawal properties of an endogenous steroid, Nature 392 (1998) 926-930.], assessed using whole cell patch clamp procedures on pyramidal neurons acutely dissociated from CA1 hippocampus. The purpose of the present study was to examine the withdrawal effects of P on the sedative potency of LZM, tested behaviorally as the ability to maintain position on a variable speed treadmill following LZM administration (0.75 mg/kg). Both continuous (continuous release P capsule, single withdrawal) as well as discontinuous (multiple P injection, multiple withdrawal) paradigms were tested. Longer continuous release paradigms were more effective in abolishing the sedative effects of LZM, without producing a change in baseline response. The LZM insensitivity observed following the multiple withdrawal paradigm was prevented by prior intraventricular administration of antisense oligonucleotide against the alpha4 subunit of the GABAA receptor. These results support the hypothesis that withdrawal from P decreases the behavioral response to LZM as a direct result of increases in the alpha4 subunit of the GABAA receptor. Withdrawal from P occurs endogenously during pre-menstrual and post-partum periods, when decreased response to BDZ has been reported.", 
    "56": "Pro-convulsant withdrawal properties have been reported for a variety of GABA-modulatory drugs, such as the benzodiazepines (BDZs, [S.E. File, The history of BDZ dependence: a review of animal studies, Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 14 (1990) 135-146; P.R. Finley, P. E. Nolan, Precipitation of BDZ withdrawal following sudden discontinuation of midazolam, DICP 23 (1989) 151-152]), barbiturates and ethanol [N. Kokka, D.E. Sapp, U. Witte, R.W. Olsen, Sex differences in sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol but not in GABAA receptor binding, Pharm. Biochem. Behav. 43 (1992) 441-447]. In this report, we test the hypothesis that pro-convulsant effects are produced by withdrawal from the GABA-modulatory neurosteroid 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) after sustained exposure to elevated circulating levels of its parent compound progesterone (P). Seizure activity was precipitated by picrotoxin or with the BDZ inverse agonist n-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (beta-CC), and a seizure rating determined 24 h after abrupt discontinuation of P following a multiple withdrawal/chronic administration paradigm. In some cases, a pseudopregnant rat model was employed to produce increased ovarian production of P prior to withdrawal (ovariectomy). Rats undergoing P withdrawal exhibited greater seizure-like activity than vehicle-treated controls, and received seizure scores in the same range as rats undergoing BDZ withdrawal. Administration of a 5alpha-reductase blocker, MK-906, along with P, prevented this pro-convulsant effect of P withdrawal, suggesting that the GABA-modulatory 3alpha,5alpha-THP is the active compound responsible for this withdrawal effect. Combined administration of P and diazepam produced synergistic effects upon withdrawal and produced a seizure score higher than observed after withdrawal from either agent alone. These results suggest that P exhibits withdrawal properties via the neuroactive steroid 3alpha, 5alpha-THP, that include exacerbation of seizure activity. These results may have clinical relevance, as increased incidence and severity of seizures has been reported in susceptible women during times of declining circulating levels of P across the menstrual cycle [T. Backstrom, B. Zetterlund, S. Blom, M. Romano, Effects of intravenous progesterone infusions on the epileptic discharge frequency in women with partial epilepsy, Acta Neurol.

These experiments in fasted rats on satiety after oil premeals were performed to 1) determine whether satiety was induced by lipolytic products but not triglycerides; 2) confirm that oil empties from the stomach at rates that vary with oil loads; 3) ascertain that increasing rates of oil entry into duodenum extend the length of gut contacted by lipolytic products; and 4) judge whether length of gut contacted correlated with dose-responsive satieties to dietary oils. 5) Using specific antagonists, we attempted to define how satiety was signalled by gut sensors. Timing and degrees of satiety did not correlate with timing and extent of gastric distensions but, rather, with the timing and extent of spread of lipolytic products along small bowel. Satiety after the highest premeal load of oil was blocked by Pluronic L-81, an inhibitor of intestinal secretion of apolipoprotein A-IV, but was unaffected by MK-329 (a specific antagonist of cholecystokinin) or by capsaicin blockade of chemosensory nerves.",

Animals were made tolerant by intracerebroventricular infusion with pentobarbital (300 microg (10 microl)(-1) h(-1) for six days) through pre-implanted cannulae. Pentobarbital dependence was assessed 24 h after abrupt withdrawal from pentobarbital.

In the rats made dependent on pentobarbital, significant increases in the Bmax of [3H]flunitrazepam binding without changes in Kd were noted in central medial and central lateral nuclei. GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurons in the ventrobasal nucleus and in nuclei in the midline group are important in seizure regulation and arousal.

The HAW line had significantly greater alcohol withdrawal severity scores compared to the LAW line after only a single generation of selection; the magnitude of the line difference was 8-fold by the fourth selected generation. We tested these lines for severity of withdrawal convulsions following the benzodiazepine, diazepam; the gaseous anesthetic, nitrous oxide; the imidazopyridine, zolpidem and the barbiturate, pentobarbital. In all cases, HAW mice had significantly greater withdrawal severity than mice of the LAW line. These results indicate that some genes influencing withdrawal convulsion severity following ethanol also affect withdrawal from other CNS depressants. D2 mice are more sensitive to a variety of convulsants than B6 mice (and have more severe withdrawal convulsions). We, therefore, tested separate groups of mice of both selectively bred lines for threshold sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid (KA). No line differences were detected. These results indicate that genes influencing severity of withdrawal from several depressant drugs are largely different from those affecting susceptibility to GABAergic or glutamatergic convulsants.", 
    "73": "Olanzapine is a newly developed atypical neuroleptic with a marked affinity to the 5-HT2, D2 and D4 dopamine receptors. Like other atypical neuroleptics olanzapine is considered to show a reduced prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects when compared to classical neuroleptic drugs. We report on three patients with acute schizophrenia, who developed severe akathisia during treatment with olanzapine (20-25 mg/d). In two of these cases akathisia resolved after withdrawal of olanzapine and substitution by a classical or an atypical neuroleptic agent, respectively. In one of these patients olanzapine was well tolerated when reintroduced in combination with lorazepam after complete remission of akathisia. In the third patient akathisia was sufficiently controlled by dose reduction. Akathisia is generally considered to result from D2 dopamine receptor antagonism. In the case of atypical neuroleptics such as olanzapine a low but still considerable D2 dopamine receptor occupancy may be compensated by the 5-HT2 antagonism. However, this mechanism may fail under certain circumstances, in particular if D2 dopamine antagonism exceeds a certain threshold. One should therefore be aware of possible extrapyramidal side effects with olanzapine that are reduced compared to classical neuroleptic drugs but not completely eliminated.",

Significant relationships were observed between neurochemicals and global scores or some items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, before and after treatment.

In this report we describe 5 cases with accompanying obstruction of the airways after intramuscular injections of levomepromazine (LPZ), a potent sedative phenothiazine, in combination with intravenous injections of benzodiazepine (BZ) during a 3-month period in a psychiatric intensive care unit. Two out of 5 cases were unpredictable because obstruction of the airways occurred 2 hours or more after the last injection. As compared with patients who received parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) injections during the same period, the dose of intramuscular LPZ was significantly large in the 5 cases with obstruction of the airways. All 5 of these cases received intramuscular LPZ 0.52 mg/kg or more. In contrast, there was no patient with obstruction of the airways who received only intramuscular LPZ, the combination of LPZ and HDL, or BZ and HDL. The occurrence of obstruction of the airways among patients who received both intramuscular LPZ and intravenous BZ was significantly higher than among patients who received other drug regimes. These preliminary results suggest that the intramuscular use of LPZ with intravenous BZ may be a risk for obstruction of the airways.",

Twelve FH + and eight FH - subjects were challenged with 1 mg of alprazolam or placebo in a double-blind crossover design. FMRI scans were obtained at baseline, 1 and 2 h after the challenge using the dynamic susceptibility contrast method with gadolinium. Mood scales, the Tufts Addiction Research Center Inventory-Morphine Benzedrine Group Scale and the drug liking scale, were administered every 30 min to assess drug effects. Global analysis of CBV showed a treatment by time decrease on alprazolam relative to placebo, but no effect by family history. The FH + group showed rCBV decreases at 1 h in the left caudate and left inferior prefrontal region, while the FH - group showed rCBV decreases at 2 h in the right inferior prefrontal region and anterior cingulate in response to alprazolam relative to placebo. FH + subjects reported more mood enhancement with alprazolam. This fMRI technique detected global and regional CBV changes induced by alprazolam. The location and rate of alprazolam-induced rCBV changes differed between FH + and FH - subjects. These changes may be related to the increased mood enhancement found in subjects genetically predisposed to alcoholism.",

At least one of the nine most common drugs-of-abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, ethanol, opiates, opioids, and phencyclidine) was detected in 64.5% of the specimens, and combinations of these drugs were present in 45.4%. For most drugs, age, gender, ethnicity, time of day, day of week, and indication for screening could not be used to predict the drug screen result.", 
    "78": "The analyst in toxicology is daily confronted with blood benzodiazepine research. The sensitivity of the immunoenzyme technique initially designed for urine testing has been improved. Nevertheless some discrepancies persist between clinical and biological observation. This work based on kinetic characteristics of benzodiazepine and analytical sensitivity indicates drug quantities which should be ingested to have a positive test. These quantities are computed for a man and a woman of average weight of 70 kg and 50 kg and for a child weighing 13 kg (about three years old). They are then compared to quantities usually considered as toxic. Nevertheless, these values have to be adapted on a case to case basis. As a general observation, analytical sensitivities for benzodiazepine are variable but the immunoenzyme technique ensures a good covering of real toxic quantities of the drug. Flunitrazepam is the one which has the worst covering probability.", 
    "79": "Melatonin (10 and 20 mg/kg) potentiated pentobarbitone (45 mg/kg) induced hypnosis; it (50 and 100 mg/kg) decreased both total and ambulatory activity; produced (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg) hypothermia and possessed (10-400 mg/kg) significant analgesic property both in tail-flick and acetic acid-induced writhing tests. Melatonin in low dose (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the forced-swimming induced immobility period per se and also reserpine induced immobility. While the antinociceptive effect of melatonin was sensitive to reversal by naloxone (2 mg/kg), other CNS depressant profile resembled the effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "80": "In the present study, effects of midazolam, thiopental sodium, propofol, and nitrous oxide upon SEP in a clinically used dose were investigated on 24 male volunteers. In addition, antagonistic actions of flumazenil and naloxone against effects of midazolam and nitrous oxide, respectively, on SEP were studied. Midazolam had no effect on latencies of N 20 and P 25, but increased latency of P 45 and attenuated P 100 amplitude. Flumazenil reversed these effects of midazolam of P 45 latency and P 100 amplitude to their control values. While thiopental sodium and propofol suppressed P 100 amplitude, they had no effect on N 20, P 25, P 45 latencies. Nitrous oxide elongated latencies of N 20, P 25, P 45 and decreased P 100 amplitude. Naloxone reversed the effects of nitrous oxide on N 20 and P 25 latencies without affecting increased P 45 latency and attenuated P 100 amplitude. These results suggest that midazolam might have an analgesic action of suppressing cortical sensory neurons, whereas thiopental sodium and propofol have no effect on neurons in the primary sensory cortex. The finding that naloxone antagonized the increased latencies of N 20 and P 25 by nitrous oxide could be explained by the analgesic action of nitrous oxide that could be mediated by opioid receptors. The results also indicate that electrical activities of the cortical neurons in the associated area are more susceptible to psychotropic agents than those in the primary sensory cortex. The effects of anesthetics on SEP appear to reflect their characteristics of functioning mechanisms on cortical neurons. Analysis of SEP is, therefore, useful for the assessment of the mechanism and the acting site of anesthetics in the sensory cortex.", 
    "81": "Sleep in humans is classically assessed by recording a multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) in connection with an electrooculogram (EOG) and an electromyogram (EMG). In general, human sleep is manually staged into 6 categories (from awake through REM sleep to stage 4 reflecting deep sleep) on the basis of a visual inspection of EEG periods (epochs) of 20 - 30 s duration. This cumbersome methodology is still used in practice and for reference purposes. - The conversion of EEG-signals by means of Fast Fourier Transformation provides objective and reproducible information reflecting specific communicative features of the central nervous system. A special part of this information based on a specific algorithm is defined by the so-called spectral frequency index (SFx). This SFx-algorithm contains relationships among some particular EEG frequencies and provides objective percentage values about the state of consciousness of a person. In order to validate this new SFx-method, sleep as a physiological state of continuous alterations of consciousness and vigilance was chosen. A total of 36 nights of sleep from 18 healthy volunteers were staged manually by a scientist unaware of the protocol. The volunteers received either placebo or lormetazepam prior to commencement of the nocturnal recordings. The manually staged data were compared with the data obtained by the SFx-analysis. Both data sets SFx values and manually staged data were made comparable by averaging their values to a basic period length of 2 min duration giving 7960 pairs of data. The SFx data for sleep were found within a range from 35% to 100%. The SFx-medians of the manually staged data from \"awake\" to stage 4 were found in a decending order (\"awake\": 83% (lower and upper quartile 78% / 87%);\"REM\": 68% (63%/74%),\"stage 1\" :63% (57%/70%),\"stage 2\" :51% (47%/57%), \"stage 3\" :44% (42%/46%) and \"stage 4\" :42% (40%/44%). The rank correlation coefficient between the data pairs was calculated to be 0.79 indicating a substantial matching between the manually staged score and the SFx. We therefore conclude that the SFx is a suitable and objective indicator of sleep depth in humans.",

    "83": "Glioma cells in acute slices and in primary culture, and glioma-derived human cell lines were screened for the presence of functional GABA(A) receptors. Currents were measured in whole-cell voltage clamp in response to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). While cells from the most malignant glioma, the glioblastoma multiforme, did not respond to GABA, an inward current (under our experimental conditions with high Cl- concentration in the pipette) was induced in gliomas of lower grades, namely in 71% of oligodendroglioma cells and in 62% of the astrocytoma cells. Glioma cell lines did not express functional GABA(A) receptors, irrespective of the malignancy of the tumour they originate from. The currents elicited by application of GABA were due to activation of GABA(A) receptors; the specific agonist muscimol mimicked the response, the antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin blocked the GABA-activated current and the benzodiazepine receptor agonist flunitrazepam augmented the GABA-induced current and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM decreased the GABA current. Cells were heterogeneous with respect to the direction of the current flow as tested in gramicidin perforated patches: in some cells GABA hyperpolarized the membrane, while in the majority it triggered a depolarization. Moreover, GABA triggered an increase in [Ca2+]i in the majority of the tumour cells due to the activation of Ca2+ channels. Our results suggest a link between the expression of GABA receptors and the growth of glioma cells as the disappearance of functional GABA(A) receptors parallels unlimited growth typical for malignant tumours and immortal cell lines.", 
    "84": "Loss of chromosomes is a recurrent event in cancer. Chromosome-10 losses occur with tumor progression and characterize advanced gliomas. This chromosome carries many genes involved in glucose metabolism. Hexokinase (HK) gene is located on chromosome-10. Hexokinase enzymatic activity is decreased in glioblastomas. Hexokinase enables glucose entry into glycolysis and is critical for these highly glycolytic tumors. These enzyme is either free in the cytosol or bound to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Disturbance of HK binding to mitochondria by lonidamine led to inhibition of cells and xenografted-glioma growth. Hexokinase bind to a mitochondrial porin which involved peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Inhibition of HK and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors by lonidamine and diazepam led to synergistic antitumoral activity in xenografted gliomas. Co-inhibition of these two receptors will lead to a decrease in glycolysis, often elevated in these tumors, without modifying energetic metabolism of normal cells.", 
    "85": "We have examined the use of presurgical morphine-midazolam combination in 80 children aged 2-10 y undergoing repair of hypospadias. They were allocated randomly, in a double-blind study, to receive one of four morphine-midazolam combination doses (n = 20 each); (group I: 75 microg/kg each) [corrected] (group II: 75 microg/kg [corrected] morphine, 50 microg/kg [corrected] midazolam); (group III: 50 microg/kg [corrected] morphine, 75 microg/kg [corrected] midazolam); (group IV: 50 microg/kg [corrected] each). Drugs were given after induction of anesthesia and before the start of surgery. Observational scoring system, using crying, movement, agitation, posture and localization of pain as scoring criteria, was used to assess the children during their stay in the recovery room together with their sedative and/or analgesic requirement. Pre-surgical morphine-midazolam administration produced stable hemodynamic variables with satisfactory postoperative analgesia suggesting 75 microg/kg [corrected] dose of both morphine and midazolam as upper permissible dose, and 50 microg/kg [corrected] each as lower effective dose.", 
    "86": "A novel paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm with a suprathreshold first and a subthreshold second stimulus was used in healthy volunteers to investigate the acute effects of a single oral dose of various CNS-active drugs on short-interval motor evoked potential (MEP) facilitation. MEPs were recorded from the relaxed abductor digiti muscle. Three peaks of MEP facilitation were consistently observed at interstimulus intervals of 1.1-1.5 ms, 2.3-2.7 ms, and 3.9-4.5 ms. The size of these MEP peaks was transiently suppressed by drugs which enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function in the neocortex (lorazepam, vigabatrin, phenobarbital, ethanol), while the GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen, anti-glutamate drugs (gabapentin, memantine), and sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lamotrigine) had no effect. The interstimulus intervals effective for the production of the MEP peaks remained unaffected by all drugs. The MEP peaks are thought to be due to a facilitatory interaction of I-(indirect) waves in the motor cortex. Therefore, the present results indicate that the production of I-waves is primarily controlled by GABA related neuronal circuits. The potential relevance of this non-invasive paired TMS protocol for the investigation of I-waves in patients with neurological disease will be discussed.", 
    "87": "We have studied the earliest expression of GABA-induced CI- channels in the rat embryonic dorsal spinal cord (DSC) using in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and electrophysiology. At embryonic day 13 (E13) cells in the dorsal region are still proliferating. In situ hybridization consistently showed transcripts encoding only three GABAA receptor subunits (alpha4, beta1 and gammal); immunocytochemistry both in tissue sections and in acutely isolated cells in suspension demonstrated the expression of the corresponding proteins and also revealed staining for other subunits (alpha2, alpha3, beta3, gamma2). In patch-recordings performed in cells acutely isolated from the dorsal cord, responses to GABA were detected in 356 out of 889 cells. GABA-evoked responses, which often displayed the opening of a few channels, were mediated by CI- ions, were inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxin, and potentiated by benzodiazepines. Taken together, these observations indicate that CI- channels likely involve GABAA type receptors. Fluctuation analysis revealed channel kinetics consisting of three exponential components (Ts: approximately 1,9 and 90 ms) and a wide variety of inferred unitary conductance values, ranging between 4 and 40 pS. A comparison of these results with observations in other, later embryonic cell types and recombinant receptors suggests that most of the earliest E13 DSC GABAA receptors may include alpha3 subunit. These GABAA receptor Cl- channels may be activated physiologically as both GABA synthesizing enzymes and GABA are present in the E13 dorsal cord.",

She was given famotidine (Peptidine) the day before surgery. Midazolam was administered for premedication (5 mg per os) and for the induction of anaesthesia (2 mg intravenous). Among the various causes of delayed recovery in this elderly patient, an interaction between midazolam and famotidine is discussed.", 
    "89": "Riluzole (2-amino-6-trigluoromethoxy benzothiazole) has neuroprotective, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and anesthetic qualities. These effects are mediated by blockade of glutamate transmission, stabilizing of sodium channels and blockade of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake. The action profile of riluzole is dominated by its effects on glutamate transmission which are predominately mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-linked processes in vitro. In vivo studies show that blockade and stimulation of the different NMDA receptor complex binding sites or AMPA receptors modulate motor behavior in a characteristic manner. It was therefore interesting to examine if blockade of glutamatergic transmission by riluzole induced similar behavioral effects as direct NMDA/AMPA receptor antagonists and if these effects are mediated by a specific receptor. The effects of riluzole alone and in combination with several other neuroactive compounds on the central nervous system was assessed by behavioral paradigms to evaluate sniffing behavior, locomotion, ataxia and rigidity. Accompanying compounds included the NMDA receptor agonist NMDA, the partial glycine site agonist D-cycloserine (DCS), and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-phenyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzo-diazepine HCl]. Riluzole influenced neither stereotyped sniffing behavior nor locomotion but impaired motor coordination and attenuated rigidity induced by blockade of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor antagonists when given alone. At higher doses spontaneous behavioral activity decreased and motor coordination was more impaired. Augmentation of the riluzole effects were observed when NMDA, but not GYKI 52466, was coadministered. The glycine site agonist DCS increased the anticataleptic properties of riluzole. The results indicate that when given alone, riluzole has a behavioral profile resembling that of competitive NMDA receptor antagonists. However, coadministration of riluzole with NMDA/AMPA receptor ligands suggests that this assumption is incorrect, and that riluzole affects glutamatergic transmission by a more indirect mechanism. Nevertheless, the profile of riluzole together with its pre- and postsynaptic blockade of glutamatergic transmission implies beneficial properties in diseases where an overactive glutamate system induces chronic neurotoxicity and/or acute behavioral effects.", 
    "90": "This study was aimed at determining the effects of either Diazepam administration or chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) on spatial memory measured by concurrent discriminations in an eight arm radial maze using mice as subjects. Two different protocols involving a non-matching rule were used to evaluate either temporal order (recurrent items) or item recognition (non-recurrent items). Results showed that both Diazepam administration and CAC produced a memory deficit which was primarily observed in the temporal task, whereas item recognition was spared. These data show that Diazepam and CAC produced similar memory impairments. Thus, our study stressed the potential importance of the GABA/BDZ dysfunction in the production of organic amnesia of alcoholic origin. The overall analysis of the data suggests that both CAC and Diazepam injections would impair forms of memory sustained by automatic or incidental learning.", 
    "91": "Paradoxical sleep in the rat, cat and mouse is preceded and sometimes followed by a short-lasting intermediate stage characterized by high-amplitude anterior cortex spindles and low-frequency hippocampal theta rhythm. Several neurophysiological arguments suggest that the intermediate stage corresponds to a brief functional disconnection of the forebrain from the brainstem. This paper is devoted to the review of quantitative and qualitative influences of three generations of hypnotics on the intermediate stage-paradoxical sleep couple. Barbiturates, first-generation hypnotics, extend the intermediate stage at the expense of paradoxical sleep. Three benzodiazepines are compared, two with a short half-life (triazolam and midazolam) and one with a long half-life (diazepam). They also decrease sleep occurrence latency and increase the intermediate stage at the expense of paradoxical sleep, except for midazolam, which increases both the intermediate stage and paradoxical sleep at low dose. Zolpidem and zopiclone, hypnotics of third generation, decrease paradoxical sleep but the intermediate stage never substitutes for paradoxical sleep. The results are discussed in relationship to the functional aspects of this turning-point period of sleep.", 
    "92": "Apoptotic cell death has been shown to constitute the terminal process in some neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). A decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psiM) causing opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) in mitochondrial membranes has been implicated as a critical effector of apoptosis in a variety of non-neural cells. Opening of the PTP leads to the release of so-called apoptosis initiation factors that induce the degradative events of apoptosis, such as nuclear chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. We have extended those findings to a neuronal model of apoptosis caused by trophic withdrawal, by showing that a decrease in delta psiM is an early event occurring 2 to 6 hours before the degradative events of apoptosis. A deficiency in mitochondrial complex I activity has been demonstrated in the substantia nigra of postmortem brains and several peripheral tissues obtained from PD patients. Because delta psiM is generated by the pumping of protons out across the inner mitochondrial membrane at the mitochondrial complexes, particularly complex I, we hypothesized that the decrease in complex activity could result in a decrease in delta psiM that would render PD substantia nigra neurons vulnerable to apoptosis. In preliminary studies, we have found a decrease in delta psiM in fibroblasts obtained from some PD patients. If a decrease in delta psiM consequent on decreased complex activity is an intrinsic defect in some PD patients, it would open a number of new avenues for the reduction of neuronal apoptosis in PD. The oncoprotein BCL-2 and the scavenger protein SOD-1 have been shown to reduce apoptosis by facilitating closure of the PTP. A number of agents have been shown to maintain BCL-2 and/or SOD-1 synthesis in damaged nerve cells and thereby reduce apoptosis. Other agents, such as cyclosporin A and some benzodiazepine receptor-binding agents, have been found to act directly on the PTP to reduce apoptosis. Accordingly, agents that maintain delta psiM and PTP closure may offer new and effective means of treating neurodegenerative apoptosis.",

On a third occasion, horses were maintained with sevoflurane and given xylazine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) when the vaporizer was turned off. Horses were not assisted in recovery and all recoveries were videotaped. Time to extubation, first movement, sternal, and standing were recorded as was the number of attempts required to stand. Recoveries were scored on a 1 to 6 scoring system (1 = best, 6 = worst) by the investigators, and by three evaluators who were blinded to the treatments the horses received.

    "100": "A series of N'-phenylindol-3-ylglyoxylohydrazides, isosters of the N-benzylindol-3-ylglyoxylamide derivatives previously described by us, were synthesized and tested for their ability to displace [3H]Ro 15-1788 from bovine brain membranes. These compounds were designed with the aim of obtaining products which could exert an in vivo activity, thanks to a higher hydrosolubility and consequently a better bioavailability. Affinity was restricted to the derivatives unsubstituted in the 5 position of the indole nucleus (1, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 23, and 26), with Ki values ranging from 510 to 11 nM. The most active compounds (6, 9, 23, and 29) proved to be effective in antagonizing pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. Molecular modeling studies were performed to rationalize the lack of affinity of hydrazides with a chloro or a nitro group in the 5 position of the indole nucleus. It was hypothesized that the conformational preference of the hydrazide side chain, characterized by a gauche disposition of lone pairs and substituents about the N-N bond, prevents all hydrazides from binding to the receptor similarly to other classes of indole analogues previously investigated. The potency of 5-H hydrazides was attributed to a binding mode which is not feasible for 5-Cl and 5-NO2 counterparts. This theoretical model of ligand-receptor interaction permitted a more stringent interpretation of structure-affinity relationships of hydrazides and of recently described benzylamide derivatives (Da Settimo et al. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 5083-5091).",

Drugs acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptor (baclofen and CGP 35348), GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex (diazepam), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex (dizocilpine), and cannabinoid receptor (WIN 55,212-2) were tested for substitution or blockade of the GHB interoceptive cue in rats trained to discriminate either 300 or 700 mg/kg of GHB i.g. from water in a T-maze, food-reinforced drug discrimination paradigm. Baclofen completely substituted for both training doses of GHB; however, its potency in substituting for GHB increased as the training dose of GHB was increased. CGP 35348 partially and completely blocked the cue elicited by 300 and 700 mg/kg of GHB, respectively. In contrast, diazepam partially substituted for 300 mg/kg of GHB, while failing to produce a GHB-appropriate response in the rat group trained to the higher GHB dose. Neither dizocilpine nor WIN 55,212-2 substituted for GHB. Collectively, these data suggest that: a) GHB produces a compound stimulus; and b) GABA(B)- and GABA(A)-mediated cues are prominent components of the mixed stimulus of GHB. However, the quality (i.e., the proportion of the component cues) of the stimulus varies as the training dose of GHB is increased; indeed, the contribution of the GABA(A)- and GABA(B)-mediated cues were smaller and greater, respectively, at 700 and 300 mg/kg of GHB training doses.",

Compound 1 competitively inhibited [125I]peptide YY (PYY) binding to Y1 receptors in human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells with Ki of 6.4 +/- 1.0 nM, while it had no effect on [125I]PYY binding to Y2 or Y5 receptors even at 1 microM. Functionally, Compound 1 inhibited the Y1 receptor-mediated increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and Y1 receptor-mediated attenuation of cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 95 +/- 5 and 320 +/- 10 nM in SK-N-MC cells, respectively. Neither its CCK-B receptor antagonistic moiety of Compound 1 (Compound 2) nor its histamine H2 receptor antagonistic moiety of Compound 1 (Compound 3) had any effect on [125I]PYY binding, suggesting that the entire structure of Compound 1 is essential for Y1 receptor blocking activity. It showed no significant activity (IC50 > 1 microM) in 30 receptor binding assays and 5 enzyme assays, with the exception of CCK-B and histamine H2 receptors.

    "115": "The traditional view of opioids held that the individual opioid agonists shared the same mechanism of action, differing only in their potency and pharmacokinetic properties. However, recent advances in opioid receptor pharmacology have made this view obsolete. Distinguishing features of the synthetic opioid agonists are related, at least in part, to variation in affinity and intrinsic efficacy at multiple opioid receptors. Respiratory depression is the opioid adverse effect most feared by anaesthesiologists. Specific kappa-receptor agonists produce analgesia with little or no respiratory depression. There are a number of commercially available kappa-receptor partial agonist drugs, the so-called agonist-antagonist or nalorphine-like opioids, which appear to have a limited effect on breathing. Within the series of fentanyl analogues there are differences in behaviour towards particular opioid receptors and there is evidence for subtle differences in respiratory depressant effects. Pethidine (meperidine) causes histamine release and myocardial depression, while the fentanyl analogues do not. Pethidine has atropine-like effects on heart rate, while fentanyl analogues reduce heart rate by a vagomimetic action. Severe bradycardia or even asystole is possible with fentanyl analogues, especially in conjunction with the vagal stimulating effects of laryngoscopy. Fentanyl analogues often produce minor reductions in blood pressure, and occasionally severe hypotension by centrally mediated reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Muscle rigidity and myoclonic movement occurs frequently during induction of anaesthesia with larger doses of opioids. Fentanyl and alfentanil have been reported to produce localised temporal lobe electrical seizure activity in patients with complex partial epilepsy. There are probably fewer biliary effects with agonist-antagonist opioids than the agonist opioids. The mechanism of adverse effects after spinal administration is distinctly different for morphine, which is very water soluble, compared with more lipid-soluble opioids. The systemic absorption of morphine after intrathecal or epidural administration is very slow, resulting in long duration of analgesia and low plasma concentrations, while lipid-soluble opioids are rapidly absorbed into the circulation and redistributed to the brain. The serotonin syndrome may result from coadministration of pethidine, dextromethorphan, pentazocine or tramadol with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There are clinically important interactions between opioids and hypnosedatives, resulting in synergistic effects on sedation, breathing and blood pressure.",

    "118": "Mini-osmotic pumps were implanted on the day of birth for continuous infusion of EGF (30 microgram/d). Pancreatic DNA, RNA, and protein contents were determined at 4 and 15 d, along with wet weights of the pancreas, duodenum, jejunoileum, colon, and gallbladder. Pancreatic EGF and TGF-alpha concentrations were measured in adult controls, in control neonates at 1, 4, 8, and 15 d, and also at 4 and 15 in guinea pigs receiving either EGF or the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist devazepide (25 nmol/kg/h).", 
    "119": "EGF infusion significantly increased the weight of the stomach and duodenum at 4 d and all the gastrointestinal organs, including the pancreas, at 15 d. Exogenous EGF increased pancreatic DNA, RNA, and protein content at 4 and 15 d. Endogenous EGF and TGF-alpha concentrations in the pancreas were significantly higher at birth than in adults (P < 0.001) and P < 0.01, respectively) and declined during the first 2 wk postpartum. At 15 d, EGF concentrations remained significantly higher than adult levels (P < 0.01), but TGF-alpha concentrations had declined to adult values. Infusion of EGF decreased concentrations of endogenous EGF in the pancreas at 4 and 15 d (both P < 0.05) and decreased TGF-alpha concentrations at 4 d (P < 0.001). Devazepide infusion caused a significant decrease in endogenous pancreatic EGF concentrations at 15 d (P < 0.05).", 
    "120": "Pharmacologic intervention is now the most effective therapy available for treating premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there are still no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for this indication, several well-designed studies have been conducted, the results of which may guide the clinician's treatment of women with this disorder. Consequently, less-proven nonpharmacologic modalities, such as dietary modification, exercise regimens, and psychotherapy, are more readily supplanted by the use of medication. Three classes of agents have been shown to have varying degrees of effectiveness in relieving PMS symptoms and are increasingly being used to treat the disorder: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, benzodiazepines, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). While the GnRH agonists like leuprolide acetate, nafarelin acetate, or goserelin acetate have been shown to be highly effective in select cases, their side effects relegate them to use in patients who are unresponsive to other agents. More recently, the benefits of alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) and the SSRIs (especially fluoxetine) have been definitively established. In addition to these medications used to treat premenstrual syndrome in general, other drugs that are used to treat specific aspects of the disorder include danazol for headaches and spironolactone for fluid retention.",

The drugs were isolated from serum, blood or urine using a solid-phase extraction procedure previously applied to various drugs of abuse. F-d3 and 7-AF-d3 were used as internal standards. The drugs were separated on ODS column in acetonitrile-50 mM ammonium formate buffer, pH 3.0 (45:55, v/v). After analysis of mass spectra taken in full scan mode, a selected-ion monitoring detection was applied with following ions: m/z 284 (7-AF and F), 287 (7-AF-d3 and F-d3), 314 (F), 300 (N-DF and 3-OHF), 317 (F-d3), 330 (3-OHF). The limits of detection were: 0.2 microg/l for F and 7-AF, 1 microg/l for N-DF and 3-OHF. The method was linear in the range 1-500 microg/l, the recoveries ranged from 92 to 99%. The method was applied for determination of F and metabolites in clinical and forensic samples. LC-APCI-MS seems to be a method of choice for these compounds.", 
    "122": "Previous studies have shown that galvanic stimulation of semicircular canal organs can modulate their afferent discharge. However, it has not been resolved whether this modulation derived from direct stimulation of hair cells, afferent nerve fibers, some combination of the two, or some as yet unknown path. This problem is addressed in the present study. Experiments were designed first to determine the gross current path necessary for the DC current to modulate afferent firing. These led to the conclusion that the current path had to flow between endolymph and perilymph across the neuroepithelium. Next, the various components in this established path were considered: the afferents, the hair cells, between the hair cells, or some combination of the three. These experiments led to the conclusion that the current pathway was across the hair cells causing transmitter release and thus affecting afferent activity.", 
    "123": "The inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine directly cause an increase in conductance to Cl- by binding to ligand-operated ion channel receptors at the postsynaptic membranes, so that opening of Cl- channels usually leads to a net hyperpolarization. The GABA(A) receptor has separate but allosterically interacting binding sites for GABA, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anesthetic steroids and the convulsant picrotoxinin. The GABA(C) receptor also forms a Cl- channel, however its pharmacology differs from that of the GABA(A) receptor. Neurotoxic organochlorine pesticides belonging to the group of polychlorocycloalkanes (cyclodienes and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane or lindane) induce in mammals an hyperexcitability syndrome that can progress until the production of tonic-clonic convulsions. They act as non-competitive GABA antagonists interacting with the picrotoxinin site both in membranes and in intact cultured neurons, thereby inhibiting the GABA-induced Cl- flux following activation of either GABA(A) or GABA(C) receptors. We also report the effects of polychlorocycloalkanes on glycine-induced 36Cl- flux in primary neuronal cultures. The delta isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane is a depressant compound, that increases the GABA-induced Cl- flux and allosterically increases benzodiazepine binding at the GABA(A) receptor. We discuss the mechanism of action of these compounds in relation to the disruption of ligand-operated Cl- channel receptors and the relevance of their convulsant/depressant actions.", 
    "124": "Treatment of SE is based on the age of the patient and the possible underlying etiology. Initial treatment should include a benzodiazepine (lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg or diazepam 0.5 mg/kg). Specimens for laboratory tests should be drawn early in the event of a prolonged seizure and geared toward the clinical presentation and age of the patient. If a seizure lasts longer than 10 minutes, phenobarbital 20 mg/kg dose should be administered with strict adherence to the proper rate of administration. Further seizure activity during drug administration can be treated with additional doses of lorazepam or diazepam. If a seizure lasts longer than 10 minutes, a second long-acting anticonvulsant should be administered, followed by induction of general anesthesia.", 
    "125": "A 16-year-old girl had fully manifested Coffin-Lowry syndrome and drop episodes. Her drop episodes were precipitated by sudden unexpected tactile or auditory stimuli associated with the electrostatic circumstances in her leg muscles immediately after the stimuli. Studies revealed that her drop episode symptom was an unusual type of startle response and that it may be associated with Coffin-Lowry syndrome.", 
    "126": "Eleven children, 4-48 months old, with congenital cyanotic heart defects developed choreoathetoid movements 2-12 days after cardiac surgery with hypothermia and extracorporeal circulation (ECC). The abnormal movements mainly involved the limbs, facial musculature, and tongue, leading to a severe dysphagia. The symptoms had an acute onset, after a period of apparent neurologic normality, and had a variable outcome. Of the nine children that survive, three had abnormal movements when last seen (41 days to 12 months of follow-up). The other six children had a complete regression of the choreoathetoid movements 1-4 weeks after onset. No specific finding was observed in the CT scans, cerebrospinal fluid examination, or EEG that could be related to the abnormal movements. Symptomatic therapy with haloperidol with or without benzodiazepines led to symptomatic improvement in six children, although there was no evidence that this treatment modified the evolution of the disease. The authors conclude that the choreoathetoid syndrome after cardiac surgery with deep hypothermia and ECC is an ill-defined entity requiring additional study to better understand its pathogenesis so that preventive measures can be taken to avoid a condition that can lead to permanent and incapacitating neurologic sequelae.",

    "129": "SPECT demonstrated decreased binding throughout the cerebral cortex and cerebellum in all patients. Binding potential (receptor concentration x affinity) was diffusely decreased in cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum and cerebellum compared with control subjects, suggesting that GABAergic function may be decreased globally in these patients. Cerebral blood flow was largely normal, and no cerebral cortical atrophy was evident on MRI.",

    "131": "Glutamate, as the main transmitter of corticostriatal pathway, has a crucial role in the regulation of the activity of striatal cells as well as in pathogenesis of some diseases characterized by striatal malfunction caused by overexcitation of neurons. In the present study, the role of ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors was investigated in the striatal synaptic transmission. Using conventional intracellular electrophysiological methods in brain slices, we have investigated the effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (+/-) 2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate (APV) and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) antagonist (+/-) 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methyl-carbamoyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiaz epine (GYKI 53655) on the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by electrical stimulation of corpus callosalpham. The AMPA antagonist significantly decreased electrically evoked responses and a weak inhibition was also observed after APV application. The results were compared to similar data obtained in a cortical slice study.", 
    "132": "The effects of 14 different 1,4-benzodiazepines on amygdaloid-kindled seizures and their chemical structure-related anticonvulsive actions were studied. The prophylactic effects of 1, 4-benzodiazepines on amygdaloid-kindled seizures were also examined. Male Wistar strain rats were used in this study. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (35 mg/kg i.p.) and bipolar electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala. The stimulating parameters were 1 ms pulse duration, 60 Hz frequency and a 1 s duration at an intensity just sufficient to induce afterdischarge (AD). All the 1,4-benzodiazepines depressed both seizure stage and AD duration of amygdaloid-kindled seizures. Of the 1, 4-benzodiazepines, prazepam, flutoprazepam and flurazepam with a long alkyl chain at position 1 were less effective than the drugs having a hydrogen or methyl group at the same position. Nitrazepam, nimetazepam, flunitrazepam and clonazepam which have a nitro group at position 7 showed more potent antiepileptic activity than the drugs with a chloro group. Certain 1,4-benzodiazepines caused inhibition of the development of amygdaloid-kindled seizures. The existence of a hydrogen or methyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 7 is important for exhibiting potent anticonvulsant activity in amygdaloid-kindled seizures. Introduction of an oxygen group at position 2 is also necessary for high activity. 1,4-benzodiazepines had not only therapeutic but also prophylactic effects on amygdaloid-kindled seizures.", 
    "133": "Effects of low doses of ionizing radiation and heat on behavioural responses of white rats and effects of diazepam and pyracetam long after separate and combined exposure to the two factors were studied. These changes were not present in a month after cessation of the exposure. Certain features of the modulating effect of pyracetam on behavioural responses, were revealed.", 
    "134": "This study analysed the frequency of distress at induction (DAI) in 2122 paediatric patients. The data were analysed to assess predictors of DAI and to examine associations between predictors of DAI and recovery characteristics. Patient age, preoperative behaviour, premedication (oral midazolam, n = 480) and venue for anaesthesia induction were associated with changes in the incidence of DAI. Distressed preoperative behaviour was a good predictor of DAI in all age groups. Premedication reduced the incidence of DAI in children aged 0.5-2 years old, and in older children who were distressed preoperatively. Induction in the Day Surgery Unit was associated with a reduction of the incidence of DAI in younger children. Children with DAI were more likely to suffer from distress at arousal (P = 0.001). Average early recovery time was prolonged 4.4 minutes and average discharge time in day patients was delayed 36 minutes by the use of oral midazolam premedication. Premedication was not significantly associated with arousal distress. We conclude that a policy of optimizing nonpharmacological approaches for minimizing induction distress, combined with selective premedication with oral midazolam, can produce a low incidence of induction distress and adverse effects.",

This article dealing with drugs together with the article dealing with the \"actors\" are reviews of results published in book form (English summary) (1). Two thirds of the samples were cannabis, mainly hash. Medical prescription drugs, mainly benzodiazepines, constituted 11% of the samples. Amphetamine was found in 9% of the samples and heroin in 8%. Cocaine and other euphoriants were each found in less than 1% of the samples. The purity of all types of drugs varied greatly during the study period, good and poor quality drugs being available on the market at the same time. No difference was found between the purity of drugs in user packages and that of drugs in large packages. Most batches were on the market only for a brief period of time. It is concluded that it is difficult for users to obtain the same quality of a substance each time.", 
    "136": "Relapse is the \"return of a disease after partial recovery\", and is a major feature of schizophrenia disorder. It can be defined in terms of need for change in treatment, including rehospitalization or crisis intervention, the re-emergence of florid psychotic features, or gross social decompensation. Relapse is best viewed as continuum of severity rather than as discrete \"attacks\". Factors influencing relapse include major life events and the family constellation. Antipsychotic drugs protect against the latter but not the former, and relapse may be mediated by non-specific arousal mechanisms. The efficacy of drug treatment in postponing rather than preventing relapse is well established. The interval between relapses is prolonged at least two-fold, but in the long run most patients relapse. Unwanted effects of antipsychotic drugs can be a burden to patients, impairing quality of life. In particular, movement disorders and subjective dysphoria may be marked, as may compliance. Of these EPS, tardive dyskinesia is the most serious on long term use. Non-EPS long term effects include weight gain and endocrine changes. Depot medication has advantages over oral medication in the more ill, less compliant patients. Side effects may, however, be more marked. The greatest pain is in improved compliance but the regular supervision of the patient is also helpful. Pharmacokinetic issues are poorly understood. High and mega-dose strategies have been advocated. High doses may be needed in some patients, but megadoses are rarely justified and may be hazardous. Low dose and intermittent therapy have been evaluated but are not as successful as hoped. Some less ill patients may benefit. These schedules depend on the identification of prodromata of relapse which is not always easy, nor are relapses necessarily preceded by prodromata. Newer drugs are being developed rapidly in the search for a safer clozapine, the only antipsychotic with definitely enhanced efficacy. Other drugs which have been re-evaluated include the benzodiazepines. However, the area of greatest priority in research is that of interactions, particularly potentiation, between drug and non-drug treatments.", 
    "137": "Binding of the radioligand [3H]flunitrazepam to membranes prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult, male guinea pigs under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions was used to investigate the allosteric interaction between the intravenous general anesthetic propofol and the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. Propofol induced a potentiation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding with an EC50 of 9+/-4 microM. Propofol increased the affinity for [3H]flunitrazepam binding with no change in maximal binding. Propofol did not change the rate constant of association for [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebral cortical membranes. In contrast, the rate constant for dissociation of [3H]flunitrazepam was significantly decreased in the presence of propofol. These data demonstrate that propofol increases the affinity of the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor via a selective decrease in the rate constant for dissociation, and suggest a mechanism for the allosteric interaction between propofol and benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor.",

Eligible children had partial epilepsies or only generalized tonic-clonic seizures. After a drug initiation protocol, monotherapy treatment mimicked the usual routines used by Canadian child neurologists.

Overall, 56% continued to receive the original medication for 1 year with no difference between CLB and standard therapy (CBZ and PHT). Seizure control was equivalent for all three medications, as were side effects. PHT and CBZ induced more biologic side effects, such as rash, while CLB induced slightly more behavioral effects.

    "142": "Five male Wistar rats were exposed to a two- component multiple schedule. In one component, signaled by a tone, food pellets were presented on a random-time 120-s schedule. In the other component, food pellets were presented on a random-time 30-s schedule. Pellets were only presented during a 10-s time-in period that alternated with a 50-s time-out period, unless the subject pressed a lever to postpone time-out presentation by 20 s. Response-independent food pellets were never presented within 2 s of this avoidance response. For most subjects avoidance rates were consistently higher when response-independent food pellets were delivered infrequently than when they were delivered more often. The amount of time spent in time-in varied considerably between subjects but was not consistently related to the frequency of response-independent pellet presentation. Once stable response rates were established subjects were intraperitoneally injected with different doses of chlordiazepoxide (1, 3, 10, 17, or 30 mg/kg) or buspirone (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 1.7, 3.0, or 4.2 mg/kg). Low doses of chlordiazepoxide either did not affect or slightly increased avoidance response rates, whereas higher doses (10 mg/kg and up) produced a dose-dependent decrease in avoidance responding. The time subjects spent in the presence of stimuli associated with the availability of response-independent food either did not change or increased slightly after the lower doses of chlordiazepoxide, while it decreased dose dependently following the higher doses. Low doses of buspirone increased avoidance rates in subjects first exposed to chlordiazepoxide, but did not alter rates in the remaining subjects. Intermediate doses of buspirone decreased avoidance rates more in the component with the lower frequency of pellet presentation, higher doses further decreased response rates. The amount of time spent in the presence of stimuli associated with pellet presentation was minimally affected by the lower doses of buspirone, but decreased dose dependently following the higher doses. The results of this experiment add further credence to the notion that the behavioral effects of drug administration may depend on nonpharmacological variables including, but not limited to, the nature of the consequent event.",

All patients were submitted to a complete stomatological exam and X-ray pantomography to exclude mucosal macroscopical lesions and dentistry illnesses. All patients executed sierological exams (glycemia, etc.), neurological exam, tongue and foot dorsum quantitative sensory examination, tongue and face telethermography.

Patients were classified as having either overt generalized status epilepticus (defined as easily visible generalized convulsions) or subtle status epilepticus (indicated by coma and ictal discharges on the electroencephalogram, with or without subtle convulsive movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation). Treatment was considered successful when all motor and electroencephalographic seizure activity ceased within 20 minutes after the beginning of the drug infusion and there was no return of seizure activity during the next 40 minutes. Analyses were performed with data on only the 518 patients with verified generalized convulsive status epilepticus as well as with data on all 570 patients who were enrolled.",

In this group, lorazepam was successful in 64.9 percent of those assigned to receive it, phenobarbital in 58.2 percent, diazepam plus phenytoin in 55.8 percent, and phenytoin in 43.6 percent (P=0.02 for the overall comparison among the four groups). Lorazepam was significantly superior to phenytoin in a pairwise comparison (P=0.002). Among the 134 patients with a verified diagnosis of subtle generalized convulsive status epilepticus, no significant differences among the treatments were detected (range of success rates, 7.7 to 24.2 percent). In an intention-to-treat analysis, the differences among treatment groups were not significant, either among the patients with overt status epilepticus (P=0.12) or among those with subtle status epilepticus (P=0.91).

The method can also be used for the extraction of lorazepam and lorazepam-glucuronide. Because the samples do not have to be hydrolyzed before extraction, valuable information is preserved. With the exception of lorazepam-glucuronide, recoveries between 86 and 100% were obtained at spiking levels up to 200 ng of benzodiazepine or glucuronide per milliliter of urine. Using methanol/water (90:10, v/v) as an eluent, the immunoadsorber could be used at least 20 times. High-performance liquid chromatograms of urine samples from patients receiving low therapeutic dosages of diazepam or lorazepam are shown to demonstrate the high purity of the extracts.", 
    "152": "The treatment of alcoholism has changed during the past 2 decades. Notable developments have occurred in pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and health-care delivery. A better understanding of the biologic basis for addiction has led to clinical trials of medications that target neuroreceptors. One such medication is the opiate antagonist naltrexone, which decreases the craving for alcohol. Psychosocial interventions continue to be the mainstay of alcohol treatment programs. The efficacy of three different therapies was demonstrated in a study called Project MATCH (Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity). This study, however, did not prove the patient-treatment \"matching\" hypothesis. In addition to therapies provided by addiction specialists, interest is growing in the use of brief motivational techniques in primary-care settings. As the field of addiction responds to an unfolding health-care delivery system, a broader range of treatment options in conjunction with a greater opportunity to individualize patient care is evolving.", 
    "153": "Typical antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine, increase synthesis of the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) in both the striatum and the nucleus accumbens, whereas atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine and olanzapine, do so only in the nucleus accumbens. By using in vivo microdialysis, we now report that acute administration of haloperidol, clozapine, or olanzapine failed to alter the release of NT in either the striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, chronic administration of haloperidol for 21 days increased NT release in both the striatum and nucleus accumbens, whereas treatment for 21 days with the atypical antipsychotic drugs, clozapine or olanzapine, increased NT release selectively in the nucleus accumbens. These findings suggest that (i) increased NT mRNA expression and NT tissue concentrations are associated with increases in the extracellular fluid concentrations of the peptide and (ii) atypical antipsychotic drugs may exert their therapeutic effects and produce fewer side effects by virtue of their selectivity in limbic compared with striatal, target neurons.", 
    "154": "Dendritic spines are of major importance in information processing and memory formation in central neurons. Estradiol has been shown to induce an increase of dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) recently has been implicated in neuronal maturation, plasticity, and regulation of GABAergic interneurons. We now demonstrate that estradiol down-regulates BDNF in cultured hippocampal neurons to 40% of control values within 24 hr of exposure. This, in turn, decreases inhibition and increases excitatory tone in pyramidal neurons, leading to a 2-fold increase in dendritic spine density. Exogenous BDNF blocks the effects of estradiol on spine formation, and BDNF depletion with a selective antisense oligonucleotide mimics the effects of estradiol. Addition of BDNF antibodies also increases spine density, and diazepam, which facilitates GABAergic neurotransmission, blocks estradiol-induced spine formation. These observations demonstrate a functional link between estradiol, BDNF as a potent regulator of GABAergic interneurons, and activity-dependent formation of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons."
