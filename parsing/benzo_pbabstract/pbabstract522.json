    "0": "In a double-blind randomized study the therapeutic anxiolytic efficacy and the tolerance of metaclazepam were tested in comparison with placebo. The study was performed according to the model of the \"Study Group - Psychotropic Drugs in Medical Practice\" (Laakmann and Hippius, 1981; Laakmann et al., 1982). A total of 121 male and female patients aged between 18 and 50 years were treated either with placebo, or with 15 mg or with 30 mg metaclazepam/day for two weeks, during which period they were examined on Day 0, Day 7 and Day 14. The patients suffered from a neurotic anxiety syndrome. In the physician's rating metaclazepam showed a therapeutic effect significantly superior to that of placebo, both in the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) and in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). This effect was already noticeable at the end of the first week. Similarly, a significantly superior anxiolytic activity of metaclazepam as compared with placebo was observed in the patients' ratings in the course of treatment. This was true for the Erlangen Anxiety Scale (EKSA) as well as for the Scale of Well-being (Befindlichkeits-Skala [Bf-S]) and the List of Complaints (Beschwerden-Liste [B-L]) by von Zerssen. No difference in efficacy could be found between the doses of 15 mg and 30 mg metaclazepam/day, neither in the physicians' nor in the patient's ratings. Compared with placebo, twice as many undesirable side effects were recorded with 15 mg metaclazepam and three times as many with 30 mg metaclazepam. This was clearly demonstrated by the significantly higher frequency of daytime fatigue after 30 mg metaclazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "In view of the very extensive and often prolonged use of benzodiazepines in therapeutic practice, this study was designed to investigate whether or not cognitive ability is impaired in long-term benzodiazepine users, and to determine the nature and extent of any deficit. Fifty patients currently taking benzodiazepines for at least one year, thirty-four who had stopped taking benzodiazepines, and a matched control group of subjects who had never taken benzodiazepines or who had taken benzodiazepines in the past for less than one year were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests designed to measure a wide range of cognitive functions. It was found that patients taking high doses of benzodiazepines for long periods of time perform poorly on tasks involving visual-spatial ability and sustained attention. This is consistent with deficits in posterior cortical cognitive function.", 
    "2": "The development of knowledge about the mechanism of action of tricyclic and the so-called 'atypical' antidepressants (AD) is reviewed. The discovery of clinically active antidepressants with little or no effect on noradrenaline or serotonin uptake has disproved the widely accepted concept that inhibition of monoamine uptake is a prerequisite for antidepressant activity. Another serious objection to this hypothesis is that blockade of monoamine uptake occurs in a matter of minutes after administration while 2-3 weeks of repeated treatment are necessary for the clinical AD effect. Nevertheless, the effect of repeated treatment with AD is compatible with the hypothesis that changes in central monoamine transmission are involved in the clinical activity of these drugs. Major changes in monoamine function after repeated treatment with AD include: desensitization and reduced density of noradrenaline receptors coupled to the adenylcyclase system, opposite changes in the sensitivity of alpha 1 (increased) and alpha 2-adrenoreceptors (decreased), down regulation of serotonin2 receptors and complex changes in the behavioural and electrophysiological responsiveness to serotonin agonists, subsensitivity of presynaptic dopamine receptors and enhanced activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system, decreased and increased density of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors respectively and down regulation of [3H]benzodiazepine binding. It remains to be clarified whether some of these changes have larger roles than others or whether they all contribute to the AD activity. An important role of dopamine in the activity of AD drugs is suggested by findings in the forced swimming test, whereas both catecholamines seem to be involved in the attenuation of escape deficit provoked by inescapable shock (learned helplessness).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The substituted benzamide, clebopride, at doses (0.03-3 mg kg-1 i.p.) that were without effect per se on the secretion of gastric acid in pylorus ligated (Shay) rats, potentiated the antisecretory effects of the histamine H2 receptor antagonists cimetidine and ranitidine in this model but not those of the muscarine receptor antagonist pirenzepine nor those of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole. By contrast, clebopride was without influence on the inhibitory effects of cimetidine on pentagastrin-induced secretion in perfused stomach (Ghosh and Schild) preparations in anaesthetized rats. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the previously described potentiating effects of clebopride on the anti-ulcer activity of cimetidine in various experimental models, and the potential beneficial effects of such combined therapy in the clinic.", 
    "4": "The effects of chronic treatment with two benzodiazepines were studied on kindled amygdaloid seizures in rats. Clobazam (4 mg kg-1), clonazepam (0.3 mg kg-1) or vehicle (1 mL kg-1) was administered, by intraperitoneal injection, to fully kindled rats twice daily for nineteen days. Each rat was electrically stimulated 30 min after the morning dose on alternate days of treatment. Tolerance developed rapidly to the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam after only three days of treatment, following which only a small residual protection was maintained. Tolerance to clonazepam developed gradually over the course of the experiment, although this effect was relatively minor.", 
    "5": "Tetrazepam is a 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) derivative which, in rodents, appears to have very little sedative and ataxic effects. In an attempt to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this particular pharmacological profile we examined the interaction of tetrazepam with BZD binding sites. Tetrazepam interacted competitively with \"central\" and \"peripheral\" BZD binding sites and exhibited comparable affinities for both sites. Tetrazepam was approximately one-seventh as potent as diazepam at the central receptor and as potent as diazepam at the peripheral binding site. Tetrazepam did not distinguish type I from type II central BZD receptors, as evidenced by comparable affinities for the cerebellar and hippocampal receptors. In vitro autoradiographic studies showed that tetrazepam displaced [3H]flunitrazepam from rat brain membranes without any clear regional specificity. Like all BZD receptor agonists, tetrazepam exhibited a gamma-aminobutyric acid shift, a photoaffinity shift and potentiated the binding of 35S-t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate to rat brain membranes. However, the latter effect was observed at relatively high concentrations of tetrazepam. In vivo, tetrazepam displaced specifically bound [3H]flunitrazepam from mouse brain (ID50, 37 mg/kg p.o. vs 3.5 mg/kg p.o. for diazepam) and from mouse kidney (ID50, 38 mg/kg p.o. vs. 21 mg/kg p.o. for diazepam). It is concluded that tetrazepam is a BZD receptor agonist; the molecular mechanisms which underly the low sedative potential of the drug cannot at present be explained by a particular interaction with either central or peripheral BZD binding sites, but may be related to the drug's relatively weak effect on 35S-t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate binding.", 
    "6": "In the 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) series the nature of the C(5) substituent is critical for activity. In tetrazepam this substituent is a cyclohexenyl ring, in all other clinically effective 1,4-BZD derivatives it is a phenyl ring. The activities of tetrazepam and diazepam, whose chemical structures differ only by the nature of the C(5) substituent, were compared in rodent models which are predictive of anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and sedative effects. In mice, tetrazepam and diazepam antagonized pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, increased novel food consumption, decreased rearing behavior in the Staircase test and impaired performance in the Traction test. The effects of both drugs were abolished by Ro 15-1788. In rats, both drugs antagonized PTZ-induced seizures, released punished responding in an approach-avoidance conflict procedure and blocked the PTZ discriminative cue. In mice and rats, and with both BZDs, maximal activity occurred 15 to 30 min after drug administration. In mice and rats, the overall anxiolytic and muscle relaxant potencies of tetrazepam were one-fourth and one-sixth those of diazepam, respectively. The anticonvulsant potency of tetrazepam varied from one-half (rats) to one-twentieth (mice) that of diazepam. In rats and mice, the sedative potency of tetrazepam (Rotorod test; locomotor activity) was approximately one-sixteenth that of diazepam. Finally, tetrazepam induced a loss of righting reflex in mice, with an ED50 value which was approximately 70-times greater than that of diazepam. It is concluded that replacing the 5-phenyl ring by a 5-cyclohexenyl ring leads to a relative dissociation of the pharmacological actions of the 1,4-BZDs.", 
    "7": "The behavioral effects of several histamine H1 antagonists were compared in groups of squirrel monkeys trained to respond under fixed-interval schedules involving response-produced shock or termination of a stimulus associated with shock. Low to intermediate doses of the conventional H1 antagonists chlorpheniramine (up to 3.0 mg/kg), diphenhydramine (up to 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg), pyrilamine (up to 3.0 mg/kg) and tripelennamine (up to 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in response rate under all conditions in which they were studied; higher doses either increased responding less or decreased it. In contrast, a wide range of doses of the novel H1 antagonists AHR 11325 (1.0-30.0 mg/kg), astemizole (up to 10.0 mg/kg) and loratadine (up to 17.0 mg/kg) usually had little effect on responding, although decreases in response rate accompanied by emesis were observed after the highest doses in some monkeys. Other H1 antagonists including phenindamine (0.03-17.0 mg/kg), promethazine (0.03-5.6 mg/kg) and terfenadine (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) had different effects in individual subjects (i.e., dose-related increases in response rate in some monkeys and either little change or dose-related decreases in responding in other monkeys). The dopamine uptake inhibitors cocaine (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) and bupropion (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) had behavioral effects similar to those of chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, pyrilamine and tripelennamine, whereas the muscarinic antagonist atropine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine/5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist cyproheptadine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), the norepinephrine uptake inhibitor desmethylimipramine (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (0.3-30.0 mg/kg) produced only dose-related decreases in response rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, was tested for antimuscarinic and antihistamine effects against bethanechol and histamine-stimulated contractility and secretion in the guinea pig ileum in vitro. Comparisons were made with muscarinic-receptor antagonists, as well as with H1 and H2 histamine-receptor antagonists. Amitriptyline (0.01-5.0 microM) produced a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curves to histamine in muscle (Ki 0.4 nM) and mucosa (Ki 450 nM). The H1-receptor antagonists pyrilamine and diphenhydramine were less potent against histamine in the muscle and more potent against histamine in the mucosa than was amitriptyline. The H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine was ineffective in the muscle and mucosa. Amitriptyline (0.1-2 microM) also produced a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curve to bethanechol in muscle (Ki 133 nM) and mucosa (Ki 143 nM). Against bethanechol, in both tissues, atropine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide were more potent competitive antagonists than was amitriptyline. Pirenzepine produced a competitive blockade of bethanechol in the muscle and a noncompetitive blockade in the mucosa. The data indicate that amitriptyline exerts more potent antihistaminic effects on guinea pig ileal muscle than the mucosa but that the tricyclic drug is equipotent as an antimuscarinic in both tissues.", 
    "9": "The combined data from two 1970s anxiety studies that used clorazepate and placebo as controls were reanalyzed statistically with a focus on intellectual functioning and depressive symptoms. For the 176 patients given either clorazepate or placebo, significant improvement was observed on the mean scores of the intellectual item and the depressive item of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety; the clorazepate group was significantly more improved than the placebo group. Similar results were observed in patients' self-ratings. The authors conclude that clorazepate is effective in treating depressive symptoms and improving intellectual functioning in patients with generalized anxiety disorder.", 
    "10": "Periodic reports have suggested that benzodiazepines may be associated with a loss of control over aggressive impulses. Manifestations range from irritability to increased verbal hostility to frank assault. After reviewing data from case reports, experimental studies, and incidence reports, the authors attempt to characterize the phenomenon, estimate the incidence of clinically adverse sequelae to be less than 1%, and find consistent predictive indicators lacking.", 
    "11": "In a prospective study, the intensity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) was rated in two groups of delirious, medically ill patients. Fourteen patients received intravenous (IV) haloperidol and benzodiazepines for control of severe agitation and four received IV haloperidol alone. Patients were rated daily by a standardized scale for EPS by raters blind to the dose of haloperidol and benzodiazepines. Patients receiving haloperidol and benzodiazepines had significantly (p less than 0.001) less EPS than patients receiving IV haloperidol alone. In the haloperidol and benzodiazepine group there were only one case of very mild parkinsonian-like EPS and no cases of akathisia or dystonia. No adverse respiratory or cardiac reactions were seen in any patients. The literature on the use of IV haloperidol alone and in combination with benzodiazepines is briefly reviewed and possible explanations of the lower intensity of EPS with IV haloperidol in combination with benzodiazepines are discussed.", 
    "12": "The antianxiety drugs available today are highly effective. Before prescribing anxiolytics, the physician needs to carefully evaluate the patient to determine if true symptoms of anxiety are present and are interfering with the patient's functioning. Patient education about the cause of the disorder and the purpose of anxiolytic therapy is essential for successful management. Selection of the proper drug dose must be individualized, and regular patient monitoring is necessary to detect side effects or possible drug abuse. Careful record keeping is the best defense against legal problems arising from a patient's abusing or diverting of prescribed drugs.", 
    "13": "Risk of withdrawal was investigated in a prospective, double-blind comparison of clorazepate dipotassium, a benzodiazepine with a long half-life, and the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone hydrochloride in the long-term treatment of anxious outpatients. Patients were treated with therapeutic doses of clorazepate dipotassium (15 to 60 mg/d) or buspirone hydrochloride (10 to 40 mg/d) for six continuous months before their tranquilizer therapy was blindly and abruptly stopped. There was a significant increase in symptom severity consistent with a withdrawal reaction for the clorazepate group but not the buspirone group. For the clorazepate group, there was a suggestion that previous discontinuous exposure to benzodiazepines might sensitize patients to subsequent withdrawal effects. For the buspirone group, a higher dropout rate raised questions about patient satisfaction with therapy in this rather chronically anxious population.", 
    "14": "The abilities of 4 triazolobenzodiazepines, adinazolam, alprazolam, estazolam and triazolam, to inhibit thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor binding and to antagonize the narcoleptic effects of TRH were examined. The IC50 values for inhibition of 3H-3-methyl-His-2-TRH (MeTRH) binding ranged from 19 microM to 477 microM, and the Hill coefficient from 0.53 to 0.98. Similar ranges of values were obtained from benzodiazepines of other structural classes. Thus, the inhibition of TRH receptor binding by the triazolobenzodiazepines is similar to that produced by other types of benzodiazepines. Furthermore, the triazolobenzodiazepine, alprazolam, antagonized the narcoleptic effect of TRH. However, this action is not necessarily linked to its inhibition of TRH receptor binding since alprazolam also inhibited the narcoleptic effect of amphetamine.", 
    "15": "The effects of 3-methoxycarbonyl- (beta-CCM, Ia), 3-ethoxycarbonyl- (beta-CCE, Ic), 3-propoxycarbonyl- (PrCC, Ie), 3-N-methylcarboxamido- (FG-7142, Ig) beta-carboline and 2-acetyl-3-methoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydro-beta-carboline (IIa) as well as of their corresponding 9-acetyl derivatives (Ib, Id, If, Ih and IIb) have been studied in rabbits. In addition, the effects of 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-3-methoxycarbonyl-beta-carboline (DMCM) have also been studied. In in vitro studies, these drugs compete with 3H-diazepam to benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor in membrane preparations from brain cortex. The values of IC50 are in the nanomolar range without significant differences between the acetyl derivatives and their congeners only compound If shows a 10-fold decrease of the binding capacity in respect to its congener Ie. In the presence of 10(-5) M GABA, a decrease in the binding capacity for DMCM, Ia, Ic and Ig and an increase for If are observed. In vivo studies show that DMCM, Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb elicit three dose-dependent stages of electrocortical changes (trains of slow waves, trains of spike-and-wave complexes and \"grand-mal\" seizures). Compounds Ic, Id and Ig elicit only the first two stages. Compound Ih elicits only the first stage. While compound Ie does not affect the EEG pattern, its 9-acetyl derivative If induces changes (cortical spindles and disruption of the hippocampal theta waves) characteristic of agonist ligands of BDZ receptor. These findings confirm that the efficacy of compounds DMCM, Ia, Ic, Id, Ig and Ih as inverse agonists of BDZ receptor in the EEG paradigm parallels the reduction of their apparent binding affinity in the presence of GABA. The 9-acetylated compounds may be more inverse agonist in vivo than predicted from the in vitro findings, due to hydrolysis in the plasma.", 
    "16": "An imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro 15-4513, acting as a partial inverse agonist at the central benzodiazepine receptors has been recently reported to reverse efficiently the intoxicating effects of ethanol. In studies designed to delineate the role of benzodiazepine receptors in the ethanol-induced motor impairment difference between two rat lines selectively bred for high and low sensitivity to ethanol, however, we could not antagonize the effects of ethanol by Ro 15-4513 in the tilting plane and horizontal wire tests. Neither could we observe any consistent antagonism of ethanol actions in Han:Wistar rats, although we used a wide range of Ro 15-4513 doses, injected the drug intraperitoneally or intragastrically and before or after ethanol administration, and carried out the tests for motor impairment (rotarod, horizontal wire test and intoxication rating) at various times after the drug administration. The ex vivo assay of flunitrazepam binding in brain homogenates revealed the presence of compound(s) inhibiting the binding after administration of Ro 15-4513. Ro 15-4513 antagonized the motor impairing effects of lorazepam. In conclusion, Ro 15-4513 failed to function as a specific antagonist of moderate doses of ethanol in several tests for motor impairment in different rat lines.", 
    "17": "The effect of diazepam on the adenylate cyclase system was studied in rat synaptosomal membranes. Micromolar concentrations of diazepam inhibited the cyclase activities in the presence or absence of guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp). The inhibitory effect of diazepam was greater on the cyclase activity in the presence of GppNHp than on that in the basal state. This effect of diazepam was not antagonized by Ro15-1788, an antagonist of a high affinity benzodiazepine receptor in the central nervous system. Furthermore, micromolar concentrations of Ro15-1788 had no inhibitory effect on cyclase activities in the presence or absence of GppNHp. In addition, the bromide ion enhanced the inhibition by diazepam of the cyclase activity in the presence of GppNHp, but not the basal activity, although the bromide ion had no effect on both activities in the absence of diazepam. On the other hand, the pretreatment of synaptosomal membranes with GppNHp increased the KD value for [3H]diazepam binding from 98 microM to 198 microM. These data led us to conclude that diazepam inhibits rat brain adenylate cyclase through the effects on both a low affinity benzodiazepine receptor coupled with the inhibitory GTP-binding regulatory protein (Gi) and the catalytic protein.", 
    "18": "Pretreatment with flurazepam (3 mg/kg s.c.) or chlordiazepoxide (5.5-30 mg/kg s.c.) at an ambient temperature of 34 degrees C, markedly enhanced the cataleptic response of mice to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 5-20 mg/kg i.p.) as measured in a bar test. Also, the incidence of loss of the righting response was significantly greater in mice receiving a subhypnotic dose of flurazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg s.c.), followed by THC (5-20 mg/kg i.p.), than in animals receiving THC preceded by saline. Loss of the righting response was not associated with any gross reduction in skeletal muscle tone (inclined screen and wire grip tests) and it was proposed that the animals were not anaesthetized but instead could be placed on their backs because flurazepam had enhanced the cataleptic effect of THC. Loss of the righting response produced in mice by pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg i.p.) or by a large dose of flurazepam (300 mg/kg s.c.) was associated with a marked loss of muscle tone and probably indicated the induction of anaesthesia. It is possible that THC interacts with benzodiazepines by increasing synaptic concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, many other possible mechanisms exist and these cannot yet be excluded.", 
    "19": "Rats were injected daily for 21 days with water or with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) and then tested in the elevated plus-maze 24-30 hr after the last of their chronic injections. At this time, rats withdrawn from chlordiazepoxide showed a significant decrease in the % of time spent on the open arms, compared with controls, thus indicating enhanced anxiety. The benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788, 4 mg/kg, IP 20 min before test) significantly (p less than 0.01) reversed this withdrawal anxiety, and was without effect in the control group. The partial inverse agonist, FG 7142 (5 mg/kg IP 30 min before test) had no significant effect on the withdrawal anxiety. Possible mechanisms underlying the enhanced anxiety displayed by rats in withdrawal from chlordiazepoxide are discussed. It is concluded that a likely explanation is that chronic benzodiazepine treatment leads to an increased production and release of an endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor, with inverse agonist properties.", 
    "20": "Exposure to ethanol during pregnancy results in the alteration of (3H)-diazepam binding to synaptosomal neocortical membranes from the rat offspring. In male rats, 14 days of age, binding level diminished to 11%. In two-month-old control rats Scatchard plot was biphasic. It has been shown that prenatal exposure to ethanol leads to changes in the nature of binding in two-month-old experimental animals, as compared with the control ones. Possible relationship is discussed between the brain benzodiazepine system disorders and behaviour.", 
    "21": "The distribution of the minimum effective doses of bicuculline, corasole and picrotoxin was studied in intact mice and in mice administered different doses of 1.4-benzodiazepines (phenazepam and its 1,2,4,5-tetrahydroxy derivatives) and sodium barbital. The changes in the \"dose-response\" relationship for thiosemicarbazide have been observed with the administration of the increasing doses of phenazepam and sodium barbital. The effects registered correspond to the modifications of the GABA-receptor complex by exogenous ligands. The forms of the \"dose-response\" relationship observed, the types of the antagonism between pharmacological agents and the cooperation of their interaction correspond to the indices obtained from the \"quartet\" model of the receptor-channel complex.", 
    "22": "The present study deals with the role of protein deficiency in the neurobehavioural effects of acrylamide in rat pups exposed during pregnancy and early infancy. The data indicated that acrylamide could be more toxic in protein-deficient hosts as it significantly decreased the dopamine and benzodiazepine receptor binding and delayed the development of reflexes and land marks in these pups.", 
    "23": "Methylxanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, are adenosine receptor antagonists that exert dramatic effects upon the behavior of vertebrate animals by increasing attentiveness, anxiety, and convulsive activity. Benzodiazepines, such as flunitrazepam, generally exert behavioral effects that are opposite to those of methylxanthines. We report the finding that chronic exposure of embryonic brain neurons to caffeine or theophylline reduces the ability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to potentiate the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor. This theophylline-induced \"uncoupling\" of GABA- and benzodiazepine-binding site allosteric interactions is blocked by chloroadenosine, an adenosine receptor agonist, indicating that the chronic effects of theophylline are mediated by a site that resembles an adenosine receptor. We speculate that adverse central nervous system effects of long-term exposure to methylxanthines such as in caffeine-containing beverages or theophylline-containing medications may be exerted by a cell-mediated modification of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "24": "It has been reported that hypovolemia secondary to extensive blood loss alters the functionality of the central nervous system and is associated with changes in the dose requirements or intensity of action of various central nervous system depressants, including a benzodiazepine. To investigate the mechanism(s) of this effect, the influence of experimental hypovolemia on the pharmacodynamics, receptor binding and pharmacokinetics of a benzodiazepine drug was determined. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were made hypovolemic by removal of about 30% of their blood over 30 min. An i.v. infusion of desmethyldiazepam (DDZP) was started 30 min later and continued until the animals lost their righting reflex. Compared to results obtained with normal controls, the hypovolemic rats required about one-half the dose of DDZP to produce loss of righting reflex and had significantly lower DDZP concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid at that time. This effect of substantial blood removal could not be reversed by prompt return of the removed blood to the animals. Experimental hypovolemia had no apparent effect on the in vitro binding of tritiated diazepam to benzodiazepine receptor sites in the cerebral cortex of rats. The plasma clearance of DDZP was decreased significantly and the biological half-life was increased in hypovolemic rats compared to normal animals when both received a 30-mg/kg dose by i.v. infusion over 10 min. It is concluded that acute hemorrhagic hypovolemia increases the sensitivity of the central nervous system to the depressant effect of DDZP and decreases the body clearance of that drug in rats. Thus, the pharmacodynamics as well as the pharmacokinetics of a benzodiazepine are altered by hypovolemia.", 
    "25": "The response of post-synaptic neurokinin receptors to SP were not changed by pirenzepine or N-methyl-scopolamine. Atropine led to a slight increase in the EC50 of SP for its post-synaptic neurokinin (NK-A) receptor. In the presence of neostigmine no changes in the Emax and EC50 values of SP for its post- and pre-synaptic receptor site were observed. Only the muscarinic receptor site were observed. Only the muscarinic receptor antagonists, atropine and NMS, elicited statistically significant increases in the Emax of SP at its presynaptic receptor (NK-A). Addition of 7.4-740 nM SP resulted in a decrease in the EC50 and Emax values of ACh for its post-synaptic muscarinic receptor (M1). Conversely, 740 nM SP produced an increase in the EC50 and Emax values of ACh at its pre-synaptic muscarinic receptor (M2). Concentrations of 7.4 and 74 nM SP did not produce statistically significant changes in the Emax of ACh for its pre-synaptic M2 receptor.", 
    "26": "In vitro ligand binding studies were used to compare GABA/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ionophore complexes in various brain regions of ethanol-sensitive ANT and ethanol-insensitive AT rats. In naive rats, there were several, but fairly small line differences in the binding parameters of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam to cerebral cortical, cerebellar or hippocampal membranes washed with or without a detergent. GABA-stimulation of flunitrazepam binding in the cerebral cortex membranes was slightly greater in the AT than ANT rats. In detergent solubilized receptors, the GABA-stimulation of flunitrazepam binding emerged only in the presence of ethanol in most AT samples, whereas the GABA-stimulation was always observed in ANT samples and ethanol had no further effect. Pharmacological characteristics of [3H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate binding displaceable by picrotoxin were similar in both lines. Chronic ethanol administration tended to increase the number of these binding sites in the cerebral cortex of AT rats and to decrease them in the ANT rats. Although many differences between the lines were observed, our results indicate that the ethanol-sensitivity difference between the AT and ANT rat lines cannot be explained by enhanced function of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ionophore complex as far as this is revealed by in vitro binding studies. It remains to be studied whether these lines differ in presynaptic GABAergic mechanisms or in the actual function of the postsynaptic chloride channels before the role of GABA can be more accurately assessed in this genetic model for ethanol-induced motor impairment.", 
    "27": "1. Cisapride stimulates gastrointestinal motility, probably by enhancing the release of acetylcholine from myenteric nerve endings. Such an effect could be mediated via presynaptic muscarinic (M1)-receptors. Our aim was to determine whether cisapride could antagonize the inhibitory effects of a M1-agonist, McN-A-343 or mimic the effects of a M1-antagonist, pirenzepine. 2. Longitudinal segments were suspended in Krebs solution (95% O2, 5% CO2, 37.5 degrees C) for isometric tension recording (preload 1 g) during electrical transmural stimulation (0.1 Hz, 1 ms, sub- or supramaximal current). 3. McN-A-343 (2.0 x 10(-6) M) reduced the contractile response to supramaximal stimulation (EC50 = 1.6 x 10(-6) M), but had no effect on the contractions induced by exogenous acetylcholine. 4. The inhibitory effect of McN-A-343 on the contractile response to electrical stimulation could be reversed by pirenzepine (EC50 = 1.6 x 10(-8) M) but not by atropine. At these concentrations pirenzepine itself did not modify the contractile response to electrical stimulation. However, at 50 times higher concentrations pirenzepine inhibited the response to electrical stimulation as well as the response to exogenous acetylcholine (EC50 = 8.5 x 10(-7) M). 5. Cisapride enhanced the contractile response to submaximal electrical stimulation by 49 +/- 10%. This stimulating effect of cisapride was not affected by the presence of pirenzepine but was reduced in the presence of McN-A-343 (22 +/- 7%). 6.", 
    "28": "the effects of McN-A-343 and pirenzepine on the electrically stimulated guinea-pig ileum are compatible with an interaction on presynaptic muscarinic-(M1)-receptors. Cisapride enhances the twitch amplitude via mechanisms independent of such M1-receptor interactions.", 
    "29": "To evaluate the possible role of various hormones on fetal pancreas development, late gestational fetal rat pancreata (20 days) were cultured in a serum-free medium for 6 days in the presence of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), epidermal growth factor, triiodothyronine, or glucagon with or without dexamethasone. In the absence of any added hormone, the tissue amylase activity declined very rapidly. Epidermal growth factor alone (4.10(-7) M) could not preserve the amylase activity, whereas triiodothyronine (0.1 microM) and glucagon (4 micrograms/ml) had a deleterious effect that was prevented by the addition of DXM (3.10(-6) M). In the presence of CCK-8 (2.10(-11) M) 50 and 30% of the amylase activity was maintained on the 2nd and the 4th day of culture, respectively. The CCK-8 effect was dose dependent and was inhibited by asperlicin (10 microM). The combination of CCK-8 and dexamethasone maintained more than 80% of the amylase activity in the fetal pancreas explants through 4 days of culture. Fetal pancreas cultured in this optimal medium and treated with streptozotocin (10(-7) M) during the 1st day of culture showed a significantly lower tissue amylase activity on the 4th and 6th days than those not treated with streptozotocin. The streptozotocin effect was attenuated when insulin (0.1 U/ml) was added. These data suggest that, in addition to the well-known effect of glucocorticoid on enzyme activities in the fetal pancreas, two additional hormones, CCK and insulin, could play a role in the modulation of pancreatic amylase activity in the fetal rat.", 
    "30": "The interactions between dopamine and muscarinic receptor subtypes coupled to adenylate cyclase in superfused rat neostriatal slices were investigated using the efflux of cyclic AMP, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, as a highly sensitive parameter of cyclic AMP production. Cyclic AMP efflux induced by simultaneous activation of (stimulatory) D-1 and (inhibitory) D-2 dopamine receptors by dopamine was reduced profoundly by the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine and by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase with physostigmine, but not by the M-1 muscarinic receptor agonist McN-A-343. In contrast, upon blockade of D-2 receptors with (-)-sulpiride, dopamine-stimulated cyclic AMP efflux was inhibited by oxotremorine and physostigmine as well as by McN-A-343. Cyclic AMP efflux induced by isoprenaline, adenosine or vasoactive intestinal peptide was not affected by oxotremorine. The M-1 receptor-selective antagonist pirenzepine, unlike the nonselective antagonist atropine, was about 10 times less potent in antagonizing the inhibitory effects of (a near-maximally effective concentration of) oxotremorine upon simultaneous D-1 and D-2 receptor activation that upon selective D-1 receptor activation (i.e., upon blockade of D-2 receptors). In the latter case, pirenzepine was about 5 times more effective as an antagonist when muscarinic receptors were activated by McN-A-343 than upon exposure of the slices to oxotremorine or physostigmine, whereas the potency of atropine was independent of the agonist used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "It has been postulated that a benzodiazepine receptor with a micromolar affinity may be associated with Ca++ channels in peripheral organs. We examined the actions of Ro5-4684 (parachlorodiazepam) and midazolam on guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle contraction. Binding studies using [3H]Ro5-4684 indicate the presence of a \"peripheral\" type binding site with a Kd of approximately 4 nM and maximum binding of 1 pmol/mg of protein. Midazolam did not displace radioligand. In tension studies no activity was seen for Ro5-4684 or midazolam at concentrations below 1 microM. Higher concentrations relaxed the airway smooth muscle under basal tone, the effect was augmented significantly by epithelium removal. Similar results were obtained in tissues precontracted with methacholine or KCl. Midazolam (1 or 100 microM) significantly (P less than .05) attenuated the response to Ca++ in K+-depolarized tracheal strips, the effect was greater at low Ca++ concentrations. The compounds appear to function as Ca++ antagonists in airway smooth muscle but ar not typical as shown by their ability to reduce basal tone in airway smooth muscle.", 
    "32": "From bovine cerebral cortex extracts, used to isolate n-butyl beta carboline-3-carboxylate (8), fractions active in displacing [3H] flunitrazepam binding were purified and shown to contain benzodiazepine-like molecules. These were recognized by UV spectra, retention time in HPLC, and interaction with a specific monoclonal antibody. Such molecules were localized in synaptic vesicles and cytosol of synaptosomes. Similar molecules were also found in cow milk. The possible dietary origin of these benzodiazepine-like molecules is discussed.", 
    "33": "The effects of several convulsants and diazepam on pentobarbital-stimulated gastric acid secretion were studied in the perfused stomach of rats under urethane anesthesia. Picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol, GABA antagonists, and 3-mercaptopropionic acid, an inhibitor of GABA biosynthesis, strongly inhibited the pentobarbital-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The secretory action of pentobarbital was transiently depressed by strychnine, a glycine antagonist, and by bicuculline, a GABA antagonist; vigorous convulsions were observed in these rats. Diazepam had no effect on the pentobarbital-stimulated gastric acid secretion. These findings suggest that the potentiation of central GABAergic mediation by pentobarbital could be a main mechanism involved in pentobarbital-stimulated gastric acid secretion.", 
    "34": "We report here an in vitro pharmacologic profile for MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) at various brain recognition sites. The rank order of affinities of MDMA at various brain receptors and uptake sites are as follows: 5-HT uptake greater than alpha 2-adrenoceptors = 5-HT2 serotonin = M-1 muscarinic = H-1 histamine greater than norepinephrine uptake = M-2 muscarinic = alpha 1-adrenoceptors = beta-adrenoceptors greater than or equal to dopamine uptake = 5-HT1 serotonin much greater than D-2 dopamine greater than D-1 dopamine. MDMA exhibited negligible affinities (greater than 500 microM) at opioid (mu, delta and kappa), central-type benzodiazepine, and corticotropin-releasing factor receptors, and at choline uptake sites and calcium channels.", 
    "35": "The effect of inescapable footshock (IS) upon rats' motor activity (the open field and forced swim tests) was studied in rats subjected to drugs, and neurotoxin treatments, affecting their central neurotransmitter systems. The agonists of GABA-receptor complex, dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neuronal systems, as well as the cholinergic antagonist, partially reversed motor suppression induced by IS, while the dopamine agonist, chlorpromazine, and the cholinergic antagonist, physostigmine, potentiated it. The effects of chemical lesions of the brain monoaminergic neurons with p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), N-chloro-ethyl-2,2-bromo-benzylamine (DSP-4), 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) were more complex, depending upon the extent of monoamine depletion, and the kind of test applied. It is concluded that a decrease in the brain noradrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic neuronal activity, as well as the central cholinergic hyperactivity, might contribute to the behavioral suppression after IS. Thus the central mechanisms of behavioral deficits produced by IS involve multiple neurotransmitter systems, and the analysis of their role in more complicated behavioral patterns must also take into account changes in animals' baseline and stimulated motor activity.", 
    "36": "The effect of the experimental anticonvulsant, alpha-ethyl,methyl thiobutyrolactone (alpha-EMTBL), on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) currents was examined in cultured chick spinal cord neurons using gigaseal recording techniques. alpha-EMTBL potentiated GABA responses in a dose-dependent fashion with half-maximal effect at 7 microM. alpha-EMTBL also augmented the response to maximal doses of GABA. In competition experiments, alpha-EMTBL relieved the block of GABA currents produced by saturating concentrations of picrotoxinin whereas diazepam and phenobarbital did not. At a single channel level, alpha-EMTBL increased the probability of opening GABA channels without significantly altering the mean channel open time or the single channel conductance. These results indicate that alpha-EMTBL potentiates GABA responses and has properties which distinguish it from benzodiazepines or barbiturates.", 
    "37": "The effects of muscarinic agonists (McN-A-343, pilocarpine, oxotremorine-M, carbachol) and antagonists (pirenzepine, gallamine) applied by iontophoresis were studied on several neuronal populations in the central nervous system of rats anesthetized with urethane. Septohippocampal neurons and neurons from hippocampus, subiculum and somatic sensory cortex were studied. Oxotremorine-M and carbachol had (almost exclusively) potent excitatory effects whereas pilocarpine had some and McN-A-343 had almost exclusively inhibitory effects on the 4 populations of neurons studied. Pirenzepine blocked more easily the effects of pilocarpine and McN-A-343 than those of oxotremorine-M or carbachol. These results suggest (i) that many central neurons may bear different functional muscarinic receptors and (ii) that the various agonists studied might act through (at least partially) different mechanisms.", 
    "38": "Benzodiazepine receptors have been characterized in human brain. They have been localized mainly in the cerebral cortex and a synaptosomal enrichment was observed after brain fractionation by differential centrifugation. Benzodiazepine receptors were studied in Parkinson's disease and in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In both diseases, the [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding was unchanged when compared to control groups (Bmax and KD values) except in the caudate nucleus of parkinsonian patients where an increase of the specific binding was observed. The subcellular distribution profile of benzodiazepine receptors in Parkinson's disease was similar to that of controls. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) still enhanced the [3H]flunitrazepam-specific binding (increase of binding affinity), indicating that the functional link between GABA and benzodiazepine receptors remained intact in Parkinson's disease. The present results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors in human striatum are localized on neuronal elements which do not degenerate in Parkinson's disease and PSP.", 
    "39": "Adrenal steroids alter neuronal excitability in the central nervous system (CNS), and evidence from in vitro studies indicates that at least some of these effects are mediated by the GABAergic system. Benzodiazepine receptor binding, among other sites on the GABA complex, has been implicated in steroid-induced alterations in the CNS. To investigate the modulation of benzodiazepine receptor binding by adrenal steroids, we examined receptor binding determined by an in vivo technique in mice after adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy and after replacement with several naturally occurring and synthetic steroids. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was substantially augmented in cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus in mice 1 week after adrenalectomy, and these increases appeared to be due to increased receptor number rather than changes in apparent affinity. Similar results in cortex were found after hypophysectomy. Replacement with physiologic, but not lower doses, of corticosterone reversed the changes induced by adrenalectomy. Chronic treatment with deoxycorticosterone also returned binding to control values, but chronic administration with dexamethasone, aldosterone and dihydroprogesterone did not alter binding after adrenalectomy. Adrenalectomy did not alter non-specific binding or GABA concentrations in cortex, and delivery of radioligand did not appear to be affected. These results indicate that adrenal steroids modulate benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo, perhaps via the CR subtype of corticosteroid receptors. The steroid-benzodiazepine interaction may be especially important in the stress response.", 
    "40": "Whilst the brain-specific benzodiazepine receptor has been assumed to show a late evolutionary appearance, we present evidence for the presence of a central benzodiazepine binding site in sharks, which shows a high affinity for [3H]Ro 15-1788. However, the receptor density and the affinities of several benzodiazepine receptor ligands are lower than in mammals, thus presumably explaining why the benzodiazepine binding sites had previously escaped detection in elasmobranchs. Additionally, radio- and immunohistochemistry were performed to localize the radioligand binding sites and the antigenic sites of the shark gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor. In cerebellum, the granular layer reveals a high density of [3H]muscimol binding sites. The immunoreaction obtained with the beta-subunit-specific monoclonal antibody bd-17 seemingly parallels the distribution of high-affinity GABA binding sites. In contrast, [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding sites are evenly distributed in the molecular and granular layers, thus the results are similar to those previously described for rat cerebellum. Apparently, the respective distributions in this brain region are well conserved throughout vertebrate evolution.", 
    "41": "In this study, we investigated the effects of acute caffeine administration on the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons. Caffeine significantly depressed the firing rates of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (A10 group), but had no significant effect on the firing rates of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra zona compacta (A9 group). The action of caffeine in A10 was completely blocked by pretreatment with the adenosine agonist L-phenyl-isopropyl-adenosine (L-PIA), confirming numerous lines of evidence that caffeine and other xanthines act as competitive antagonists at adenosine receptors. The dopamine antagonist haloperidol also antagonized the effects of caffeine. This finding is consistent with a mechanism of caffeine-induced depression of dopamine neuron activity involving dopamine release, similar to that observed during amphetamine administration. Finally, the benzodiazepine diazepam also antagonized the dopaminergic effects of caffeine. It appears that, in the rat, caffeine administration inhibits mesolimbic and mesocortical projecting dopamine neurons, but has no effect on dopamine neurons that project to the striatum.", 
    "42": "The preceding studies demonstrated that norepinephrine (NE) can consistently augment synaptically mediated (70%) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced (69%) inhibitory responses of lateral hypothalamic (LH) neurons in vivo. The present experiments further characterized the interactions of NE with LH neuronal responses to GABA in terms of alpha- and beta-receptor mechanisms and demonstrated the utility of the in vitro LH tissue slice preparation as a model for future extra- and intracellular studies of NE modulatory phenomena. Extracellular activity of LH cells was recorded from diencephalic slices (450 microns) incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 33 degrees C. Interactions between iontophoretically applied NE, isoproterenol (ISO) or phenylephrine (PE) and responses of LH neurons (n = 64) to GABA microiontophoresis were quantitated and characterized using computer-generated ratemeter and histogram records. This analysis revealed two distinct actions of NE on GABA-induced responses of LH neurons. In 8 of 32 cells tested (25%), locally applied NE markedly enhanced inhibitory responses to GABA iontophoresis in a manner identical to that observed in vivo. However, in 20 cells (62.5%), iontophoretic application of NE produced a clear antagonism of GABA responses. NE also exerted dual effects on the background firing rate of LH neurons, causing both inhibition and excitation. Overall, in those cells where NE administration increased spontaneous discharge, it either antagonized or had no effect on GABA-mediated inhibition. In contrast, spontaneous firing rate was never elevated above control levels in those cases where NE potentiated GABA responses. Additional experiments demonstrated that the GABA potentiating actions of the benzodiazepine, flurazepam, were preserved in LH tissue slice preparations. In addition, iontophoretic application of the beta-agonist, ISO, routinely suppressed the spontaneous activity of LH neurons and mimicked the facilitating action of NE on GABA. Likewise, microiontophoretic application of 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) enhanced GABA-induced inhibition of LH firing rate in each of 11 cells tested. On the other hand, local administration of the alpha agonist, PE, routinely produced NE-like antagonism of GABA inhibition along with increases in spontaneous firing rate. Taken together these findings indicate that the commonly observed in vivo phenomena of NE augmentation of GABA and suppression of LH neuron spontaneous firing can be demonstrated in vitro, and most likely result from activation of beta adrenoceptors and subsequent elevation of cyclic AMP levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Based on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor model [(1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 168, 431-449], a partial model is constructed for the exobilayer portion of the GABAA receptor, an approach justified by the superfamily relationship of the two receptors [(1987) Nature 328, 221-227]. The model predicts successfully the excess positive charge on interior strands which constitute the ligand-responsive portion of the receptor. Binding to GABA expands the exobilayer portion of the receptor, opening a pathway to a chloride channel. Separate binding sites for antianxiolytics (benzodiazepines) and hypnotics (barbiturates) are suggested, with prolongation of chloride entry projected as a consequence of stabilization of the open form. The anion-exchange protein (AEP) of membranes (band 3 of red blood cell membranes) is similar in some respects to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor. Both proteins are inhibited and labeled by diisocyanatostilbenedisulfonate (DIDS), both transport Cl- and HCO-3, and both are membrane proteins. Starting with the lysines known to be labeled in band 3 protein, searches of the amino acid sequences of the GABAA receptor alpha- and beta-subunits reveal at least 4 reasonably homologous sequences. The relationship between AEP and GABAA receptor leads to the idea that the chloride/bicarbonate channel may be the ancestor of all ligand-gated channels, with ligand gating by gamma-aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine arising later in evolution.", 
    "44": "Based on recent findings of this laboratory, the hypothesis was tested that a single stressful encounter might have a persistent antidiazepam influence. Our results indicate that one exposure to a brief stressful event up to at least one month earlier prevented completely the effect of diazepam on pentylenetetrazole-induced changes in dopamine in the rat frontal cortex, elevations of plasma corticosterone levels and seizures.", 
    "45": "The triazolobenzodiazepine triazolam, applied iontophoretically onto rat cerebral cortical neurons, potentiated the magnitude and duration of adenosine-elicited depressions of spontaneous activity. Triazolam did not enhance the depressions evoked by adenosine 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide, an uptake resistant analog of adenosine, suggesting that potentiation of adenosine resulted from an inhibition of adenosine uptake. With larger application currents, triazolam depressed the firing of cortical neurons. This action was blocked by the adenosine antagonist caffeine (20 mg/kg, i.v.) implying that the depression resulted from an accumulation of endogenously released adenosine.", 
    "46": "The 22L strain of scrapie was injected stereotaxically into the cerebellum of C57BL/6J mice to determine its effect on several cerebellar neurotransmitter systems during the early clinical stages of the disease. In this model vacuolar lesions are restricted to the cerebellum with no evidence of vacuolization in other brain regions. Although vacuolar lesions develop throughout all cell layers of the cerebellum, they are most severe in the granule cell layer. Modest but significant (P less than 0.01) reductions in cerebellar weight, glutamate decarboxylase activity, and in the affinity of the N6-[adenine-2,8-3H]cyclohexyladenosine binding sites, were observed in scrapie affected mice. The densities of the high- and low-affinity adenosine receptors were unaffected. Adenosine receptors in the cerebellum are highly localized to the axon terminals of the glutamatergic, GABA receptive granule cells. GABA, benzodiazepine, glutamate, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors were not significantly altered. In addition, the high-affinity uptake of glutamate, and the activity of choline acetyltransferase were not significantly changed. GABA high-affinity uptake was slightly increased. Even though the granule cell layer of the cerebellum had undergone severe vacuolation, only modest neurotransmitter changes were apparent. Although these results suggest a tenuous relationship between scrapie pathology and the integrity of neurotransmitter systems, it is possible that compensatory neurochemical changes in uncompromised neuronal populations may have masked potentially specific neurotransmitter effects.", 
    "47": "A double-blind cross-over study of the effects of HOE 760 (histamine H2-receptor blocker) on diazepam pharmacokinetics was conducted in 12 healthy men. HOE 760 or placebo was given daily for 12 days and, after a wash-out period of 9 days, the alternate medication was given for 12 days. Diazepam 10 mg was given intravenously on day 6 of each of the 12-day periods. Blood was taken up to 1 week after the diazepam injections for assay of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam. The co-administration of HOE 760 did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "48": "Adsorptive stripping voltammetry was used to determine nanomolar levels of the benzodiazepines pinazepam, camazepam, bromazepam and thienodiazepine (BrTDO) in urine. Measurements were made by differential pulse voltammetry at a hanging mercury drop electrode. The influences of various operational conditions on the stripping response were examined. The optimum accumulation potentials and accumulation times were -0.40 V and up to 60 sec for pinazepam, -0.60 V and up to 40 sec for camazepam, -0.40 V and up to 30 sec for bromazepam and -0.60 V and up to 60 sec for BrTDO, respectively. The effects of various urine components on the voltammetric response were also studied, and preliminary separation of the drugs was found necessary because of interference by creatinine and uric acid. The proposed method is appropriate for the determination of the four drugs in urine up to the 1000 ng/ml level with short accumulation periods (10-60 sec). The relative standard deviation for the 500 ng/ml level of the drugs in urine (30-sec accumulation) was less than 3%.", 
    "49": "The use of etomidate for induction of anesthesia in patients requiring urgent coronary artery surgery provides good cardiovascular stability. However, long-term etomidate infusions may cause transient signs of adrenocortical suppression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an induction bolus dose of etomidate would cause clinically relevant endocrine dysfunction in urgent coronary artery bypass patients. With institutional review board approval, 11 patients were prospectively randomized to a diazepam (control) or etomidate rapid sequence induction. The diazepam group (n=6; mean, 69 years) received 0.4 mg/kg of diazepam. The etomidate group (n=5; mean, 54 years) received 0.3 mg/kg of etomidate. Maintenance anesthesia included nitrous oxide, oxygen, pancuronium, and fentanyl in increments up to 32 microg/kg. Hemodynamics, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were measured both intraoperatively and postoperatively. The only significant difference between the two groups in hemodynamic parameters was a higher heart rate in the etomidate group. Both agents adequately controlled the stress response to intubation as judged from the levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine. and cortisol. However, in both groups epinephrine and norepinephrine increased between intubation and removal of the aortic cross-clamp. Cortisol also increased from the time of cross-clamp removal to 12 and 24 hours post-bypass. During anesthesia and surgery in the pre-bypass period, there was a decrease in cortisol over time in the etomidate group, and there was an increase with diazepam. Thus, etomidate provided stable hemodynamics, possible mild intraoperative adrenocortical suppression, a depressed hormonal stress response to intubation, and a normal hormonal reaction to the later part of surgery and the postoperative period.", 
    "50": "The incidence of dysrhythmias during the prebypass period of coronary artery surgery has not been accurately reported. Using Holter monitoring of the electrocardiogram, this study was undertaken to determine the incidence of dysrhythmias and ischemia and their relationship to specific events during the prebypass period. The role of preoperative calcium entry blockers (CEB), beta-adrenergic blockers (BB), or both on the incidence of dysrhythmias and ischemia was also studied. One hundred thirty-eight patients were premedicated with morphine, scopolamine, and diazepam. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl or sufentanil followed by either pancuronium or vecuronium and maintained with sufentanil or enflurane. All 138 patients experienced a dysrhythmia during the prebypass period. Seventy-five percent of the patients had at least one episode of a supraventricular dysrhythmia (SVD), 39% had a sinus bradycardia, and 20% had a conduction abnormality. Ninety-two percent of the patients had premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and, surprisingly, 76% had non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. One patient developed ventricular fibrillation and one had ventricular tachycardia. The peak incidence of dysrhythmias occurred at insertion of the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter and at aortic dissection. The incidence of prebypass ischemia was 18%, but these patients did not have a higher incidence of ventricular dysrhythmias. Preoperative CEBs and BBs did not influence the incidence of ischemia or dysrhythmias with the exception of SVD; there was a significantly lower incidence at PA catheterization in patients taking CEBs preoperatively (P < .05). It can be concluded that dysrhythmias are very common during the prebypass period. The low rate of progression to life-threatening dysrhythmias may be related to the fact that the majority occurred during mechanical stimulation and that patients were chronically taking CEBs and/or BBs preoperatively.", 
    "51": "This investigation was designed to demonstrate the presence of cholinergic nerve terminals in the pressor area of the ventrolateral medulla (VLPA) and to study the effects of the release of endogenous acetylcholine in this area. Bilateral microinjections (0.1-2 nmol)/site) of 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP), which releases acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals, into the VLPA in anesthetized rats evoked an increase in blood pressure and heart rate which lasted for 20-40 min. Intravenous injections of the same doses of this agent failed to evoke a response. The ganglion blocker, chlorisondamine (3 mg/kg, i.v.) abolished the responses to microinjections of DAP indicating that the responses were mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Microinjections of scopolamine or a specific M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist (AFDX-116) into the VLPA prevented the pressor and tachycardic responses to subsequent microinjections of DAP at the same sites indicating that the responses were mediated via M2 receptors. Microinjections of hemicholinium (3 nmol/site; which impairs acetylcholine synthesis) attenuated the responses to the subsequent microinjections of DAP at the same sites. These results indicate that the substance released from the terminals in the VLPA may be predominantly acetylcholine which evokes pressor and tachycardic responses via M2 muscarinic receptors. The origin and physiological significance of these cholinergic terminals in the VLPA are not known.", 
    "52": "Zopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic with a pharmacological spectrum of activity which resembles that of the benzodiazepines (BZD), but it binds to the GABA complex at a site different from the BZD receptor. Pharmacokinetic properties class ZPC in the category of hypnotics with intermediate-short half-life (5-7 hours) and explain the low incidence of unwanted effects reported. The influence of zopiclone 7.5 mg on sleep architecture is minimal. In healthy volunteers, the amount of deep sleep is increased. No depressant effect on respiratory function and no rebound effect has been demonstrated.", 
    "53": "The main aspects of the recent development of non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs are the following: the possibility of giving drugs with peculiar anxioselective profile and with no benzodiazepine side-effects; the possibility of discriminating the anxiolytic from the hypnotic activity; the possibility of a nosographic delimitation: buspirone is used mainly in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders. All these factors point to the possibility of a guided or planned anxiolysis with a more active participation from the patients.", 
    "54": "The distinction between non-psychotic repressive illness and anxiety states is blurred. Large scale trials in the neuroses indicate that benzodiazepines are ineffective in depression, and transiently and partially effective in anxiety. In contrast, tricyclic antidepressants are effective in both. All effective antidepressants decrease 5HT2 receptors number and this may mediate antidepressant efficacy. Our studies indicate that reduction of 5HT2 relative to 5HT1 neurotransmission would reverse the neuroendocrine abnormalities we have described in depression. Reduced 5HT2 neurotransmission may also be a mechanism of anxiolytic action in view of 5HT theories of punishment. There is clinical evidence for anxiolytic and antidepressant action of selective 5HT2 antagonists.", 
    "55": "There is a need for safe effective alternatives to benzodiazepines in the treatment of panic disorder. Buspirone, a new nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic, is compared to imipramine and placebo in the treatment of panic disorder in an 8 week double-blind controlled study of 52 randomly assigned patients. Weekly assessments were made using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Sheehan Clinician Rated Anxiety Scale, the Sheehan Patient Rated Anxiety Scale, the Phobia Scale, the Disability Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale, the Investigator Rated Global Improvement Scale and the Patient Rated Global Improvement Scale. Preliminary results of repeated measures Anovas are reported. Imipramine was superior to placebo on many of the outcome measures. Imipramine was superior to buspirone on the Patient Rated Global Improvement Scale and on the Investigator Rated Global Improvement Scale, but not on other measures. Although buspirone appeared to be more effective than placebo, differences were not statistically significant. Some buspirone patients did very well compared to others, suggesting a possible bimodal distribution of response. Patients on buspirone had fewer and less disruptive side effects than those on imipramine.", 
    "56": "Clinical studies have shown that zolpidem, an original imidazopyridine derivative, induces and maintains sleep and does not have daytime side-effects. Polysomnography has revealed that this drug has several interesting qualities that benzodiazepines do not possess: stages 3-4 increase, stage 2 is unchanged or slightly reduced and no abnormal changes are detected on the EEG tracing. Like benzodiazepines, zolpidem slightly reduces REM sleep. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test confirmed that the drug does not cause daytime drowsiness. All the hypnotic drugs studied up to now worsen heavy snoring and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. A controlled double blind cross-over trial assessed the effects of a single dose of zolpidem 20 mg on nocturnal breathing in patients with mild forms of sleep apnea syndrome. The results indicate that, at this dose, the drug does not overcome the existing contraindications to the use of hypnotics in this syndrome.", 
    "57": "For anesthesia, ataranalgesic combinations of benzodiazepines and ketamine have been reported to be advantageous alternatives to inhalation agents or high-dose opioids. In this study, the influence of midazolam-ketamine-N2O/O2 anesthesia on the endocrine metabolic response of patients during the course of reconstructive orthopedic surgery (n = 8) was investigated. METHODS. The dosage of anesthetic agents was calculated according to body weight. Thus, the amount of ketamine given in young adults (mean age = 24.1 years) was 30 micrograms/kg per minute. Pre-, intra-, and postoperatively, each of following hormones was measured by either radioimmunoassay or radioenzyme-linked assay: ACTH, aldosterone, cortisol, 17-dehydroepiandrosterone (17-DHEA), prolactin, insulin, T3, T4, thyroxine-binding globulin (TGB), epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Additionally, the metabolites glucose, lactate, and free glycerin were measured perioperatively. RESULTS and CONCLUSION. The circulation remained relatively stable under midazolam-ketamine-N2O/O2 anesthesia (MAP +23%; HR +17%). ACTH secretion and prolactin secretion showed a significant rise (p less than 0.01) even before skin incision (Figs. 1, 3). A significant rise in cortisol levels occurred intraoperatively (+80%; p less than 0.01). Secretion of aldosterone (+246%; p less than 0.05) and 17-DHEA (+49%; p less than 0.05) essentially followed the secretory profile of cortisol, while insulin secretion did not rise significantly under acute surgical stress (Fig. 4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "In order to investigate whether the increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR during carotid endarterectomy are due to a systemic, sympathicotonic stress response and to compare two anesthetic regimens for this operation, 20 patients were randomly allocated to the following groups: (1) modified neuroleptanesthesia with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium: and (2) isoflurane anesthesia with vecuronium relaxation. Premedication (pethidine, promethazine) and induction of anesthesia were similar in both groups. The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine (by HPLC/ECD), ADH, ACTH, and cortisol (by RIA), glucose, lactate, and free glycerol were determined before and after induction of anesthesia, 7 times during the operation, and 30 min after extubation. MAP and HR were measured continuously. Statistical evaluation was undertaken by analysis of variance with repeated measures on 1 factor, considering P values of less than 0.05 as significant. The endocrine parameters failed to show any remarkable increase during the entire operation period. After the end of the operation all hormones rose significantly (P less than 0.001). No correlation was found between plasma catecholamines and increases in MAP and HR. Group levels of norepinephrine and ADH were higher in the isoflurane group (P less than 0.04). It is concluded that cardiovascular reactions during carotid endarterectomy are not caused by systemic stress. Neuroleptanesthesia leads to better stress protection in the postoperative period, while isoflurane anesthesia has some advantages for the intraoperative control of arterial pressure.",

Rats were made physically dependent on methaqualone by the use of the drug-admixed food (DAF) method for 33 days. Pentobarbital, barbital, ethanol and diazepam were cross-administered against methaqualone to evaluate the degree of suppression of methaqualone withdrawal signs as an index for the cross-physical dependence liability of these drugs to methaqualone. To evaluate the cross-physical dependence liability, we used AUC of body weight loss and withdrawal scores between the first cross-administration (9 hr after the withdrawal) and 27 hr after the withdrawal. AUC of weight loss was significantly suppressed by the four test drugs as compared to each control. Withdrawal scores were also significantly inhibited by the cross-administration of barbital, ethanol and diazepam. Considering that the rats given barbital or ethanol fell asleep after the cross-administration, diazepam seems to cause the strongest suppression of methaqualone withdrawal signs among the four test drugs. Thus, physical dependence on methaqualone may be similar by nature to that on benzodiazepines rather than barbiturates and alcohol.", 
    "60": "Two beta-carboline esters, methyl or ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, beta-CCM and beta-CCE, were found to antagonize the antinociceptive and satiety action of the sulfated octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK8) which was administered intracisternally to mice. beta-CCM did not affect the antinociception induced by morphine. The two beta-carboline esters weakly inhibited the food intake in mice. However, when they were administered after CCK8 administration, they reversed the CCK8-induced satiety. Since the two beta-carboline esters have been previously shown to act as selective cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists in the isolated guinea-pig gallbladder muscle, they are suggested to antagonize the central action of CCK through acting on the CCK receptor in the central nervous system. The results obtained from the present paper also suggest that benzodiazepine receptor ligands seem in general to act as CCK receptor antagonists as well.", 
    "61": "This study was undertaken to determine the serum pharmacokinetic parameters of loprazolam, a new benzodiazepine hypnotic, in elderly subjects and to compare these with the kinetics of the drug as determined by quantitative EEG analysis. In addition, a 14-day study was undertaken to determine the steady-state serum levels achieved in this population with repeated drug administration. The study was conducted on 16 male and female subjects between the ages of 62 and 72 years, randomly assigned to two groups treated with 0.5 or 1.0 mg of loprazolam. The serum half-life of loprazolam was found to be 5 hours, and the peak serum concentration was reached after 2 hours. Quantitative EEG changes were observed after 30 minutes suggesting rapid access of the drug into the nervous system. Quantitative EEG changes were evident for 9.5 hours, suggesting the persistent effects of an active metabolite. The 14-day study indicated that loprazolam did not accumulate with continued use.", 
    "62": "The pharmacokinetics of two benzodiazepine hypnotics, flunitrazepam and loprazolam, was determined on two occasions in two groups of eight healthy volunteers. Single 2-mg oral doses of either drug were given in the fasting state at morning on one occasion and after a standard dinner at night on another. Compared with administration of drugs in the fasting state, administration of the drugs after dinner decreased peak plasma concentrations, delayed the time to reach maximum concentration, and prolonged the absorption half-life. The extent of absorption was reduced for flunitrazepam but not for loprazolam. The elimination half-life of both flunitrazepam and loprazolam was not changed in the two conditions. These changes may be of clinical significance because they can delay and reduce the effects of the drugs.", 
    "63": "1. Muscarinic depression of the electrically-evoked surface-negative field potential (N-wave) was measured in guinea-pig olfactory cortex slices maintained in vitro. 2. The effects of three muscarinic receptor antagonists, pirenzepine, atropine and gallamine on this muscarinic response were analysed in detail. 3. Pirenzepine was a potent competitive antagonist of carbachol (CCh)-evoked responses. Schild plot analysis yielded a pA2 value of 7.9 (Schild slope constrained to unity). A similar analysis for atropine versus CCh responses gave a pA2 of 8.9. 4. Combination experiments using pirenzepine and atropine produced dose-ratio shifts close to those expected for two antagonists competing for a similar receptor site. 5. Gallamine was only a weak antagonist of responses to CCh. 6. Oxotremorine behaved as a competitive antagonist at this muscarinic receptor (pA2 = 6.1). 7. It is concluded that the presynaptic muscarinic receptor mediating depression of the N-wave in the olfactory cortex slice is of the M1-subtype.", 
    "64": "Twenty-five patients with major depressive disorder according to RDC were examined with computerized quantitative EEG before antidepressive treatment. Normal EEGs were found in 20 patients and slight abnormality in five cases. Relationships between various EEG variables and pretreatment accumulation rate of 14C-5-HT and 3H-NA in rat synaptosomes, incubated in patients' plasma, and 5-HT in whole blood were studied. Age and current treatment with benzodiazepines were taken into account. There was an inverse relationship between alpha-1 amplitude in all derivations and beta-2 amplitude in the parieto-occipital derivation on one hand and pretreatment 14C-5-HT synaptosomal accumulation rate on the other. This result indicates that low 14C-5-HT synaptosomal accumulation rate is related to increased EEG alertness. This EEG pattern is suggested to be associated with a serotonergic subgroup of depression. The relationships between the other biochemical variables and the EEG patterns did not show any consistent pattern.", 
    "65": "1. In an open cross-over trial, plasma concentrations of midazolam were measured in eight healthy male volunteers following administration of 0.3 mg kg-1 body weight given by the rectal and intravenous routes. 2. Maximum plasma concentrations of 92-156 ng ml-1 (mean 118 ng ml-1) were recorded from 20 to 50 min (mean 31 min) after rectal application. The rectal bioavailability was 40-65% (mean 52%) and the terminal half-life was 114-305 min (mean 161 min). 3. A substantial first-pass hepatic effect was observed following rectal administration. 4. No systemic or local intolerance was noted. 5. In conclusion, the rectal route of administration provides a rapid and reliable absorption of midazolam.", 
    "66": "The GABAergic properties of dissociated neurons from cerebral cortex of neonatal rats were studied in primary culture using electrophysiological, biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Cultured neurons had a resting potential of -50 to -60 mV and exhibited spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. Non-spontaneous (elicited) ionic currents were produced by direct application of GABA and glutamate. Cultures contained measurable amounts of GABA from the first day in culture; GABA content reached a plateau around the 10th day of culture, and continued, nearly unchanged, until the 21st day of culture. Immunohistochemistry showed that 45% of the total cells in culture contained glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), a putative neuroregulatory peptide for benzodiazepine recognition sites, was present in approximately 28% of all neurons. Ninety-three percent of ODN-positive cells demonstrated GABAergic properties as well by displaying GAD-immunoreactivity. The peptide GABA-modulin (GM), a putative GABA receptor modulator, was found in about 75% of all neurons, with a further 65% of these cells exhibiting GAD-immunoreactivity. Cells immunopositive for neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SRIF), and cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK), were found at much lower incidence (1-4%). Double-labelling studies showed that 90-97% of the cells positive for NPY, SRIF and CCK were also positive for GAD. Cells immunoreactive with serotonin or tyrosine hydroxylase were not detected. We suggest that primary cultures of neonatal cortical neurons may provide a useful experimental model to investigate the function and the modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the cerebral cortex.", 
    "67": "A double-blind crossover comparison of efficacy and recovery from midazolam 5 mg and diazepam (in propylene glycol) 10 mg was undertaken in eight volunteer subjects. It was found that midazolam was significantly more potent in this dose ratio than diazepam, helping to explain the finding of previous studies that the recovery from midazolam and diazepam in a 1:2 dose ratio is comparable.", 
    "68": "Eighteen healthy volunteers were studied in a double-blind trial to determine which dose of nalbuphine (0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg) may be combined with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg to provide a safe outpatient intravenous sedative technique. The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and end tidal PCO2 were measured before and after the drugs were administered. A mild degree of respiratory depression occurred, which was maximal at 3-30 minutes after injection. This was not related to dose except that nalbuphine 0.05 mg/kg resulted in the slowest respiratory rates. The implications of these findings for clinical practice are discussed.", 
    "69": "Children with leukemia have to undergo many times painful procedures like bone-marrow aspiration and lumbar puncture. For reduction of anxiety and pain sensation good psychological support can be an important help. Often sedative drugs are used, or even general anaesthesia may be necessary. There is a need of a safe, short-acting and effective medication. Among the different possibilities the intravenous or rectal administration of midazolam seems to be very promising.", 
    "70": "Effects of a therapeutic dose of diazepam (15 mg daily), administered over a 6-week period, were assessed in nonanxious female volunteers. No acute effects of the 5-mg dose of diazepam on performance were observed, but two types of effects were observed on physiology: (1) direct changes on some measures (e.g., skin conductance) and (2) an absence or attenuation of changes expected on the basis of data obtained with a placebo group. The latter effect was found for systolic blood pressure both initially and again after 6 weeks of medication. When performance measured in the morning prior to the first 5-mg dose was compared with that of the morning prior to the last 5-mg dose, 6 weeks later, two types of impairment were found in the diazepam group: (1) decrements in performance (e.g., digit span) and (2) a failure to show expected improvement (e.g., DSST). Performance impairment due to reduced motivation was ruled out by a motivational component of the test battery. Performance tended to return to predrug levels 2 weeks after discontinuation of medication. When physiology was measured in the morning prior to the first dose of the day, 6 weeks of treatment produced decreases in skin conductance, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Blood pressure and heart rate, but not skin conductance, returned to predrug levels 2 weeks after discontinuation of medication. Results of this study indicate that the long-term effects of diazepam can differ from the acute effects and that both acute and long-term effects can take at least two forms, depending upon the behavior or physiological process measured.", 
    "71": "A 30-year-old woman underwent laparotomy and was placed on a seven-day course of metronidazole and ampicillin postoperatively. Chloroquine therapy for malaria was instituted on the sixth day and the patient developed acute dystonic reactions after a single dose. Diphenhydramine therapy before chloroquine administration did not prevent the development of the dystonic reactions. The extrapyramidal symptoms subsided upon diazepam administration and chloroquine withdrawal even though metronidazole therapy was continued. The mechanism of this adverse drug reaction based on the pharmacodynamic interaction between chloroquine and metronidazole is discussed. It is suggested that the combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine be used in place of chloroquine for malaria chemotherapy in patients on metronidazole therapy.", 
    "72": "When rats are placed in a situation that has come to be associated with footshock through the process of Pavlovian conditioning, they react with the species-specific defensive response of freezing and a reduction in sensitivity to painful stimulation. In the present experiments, the effects of three benzodiazepines on both of these responses were examined. Pain sensitivity was measured with the formalin test. Concurrent observations of formalin-induced recuperative behavior and freezing were recorded while the animals were in the presence of shock-associated contextual stimuli. It was found that midazolam (Experiments 1 and 2), chlordiazepoxide (Experiment 3), and diazepam (Experiment 4) were capable of significantly attenuating the conditional analgesia. Midazolam and diazepam also reduced the freezing response. The finding that these anxiolytic agents attenuate both conditional responses suggests that the freezing and analgesia are mediated by a common fearlike process.", 
    "73": "The present assay was developed for quantifying midazolam in plasma of patients hospitalized in intensive-care units or undergoing anesthesia and receiving many other drugs as well. Plasma samples are alkalinized with NaOH and midazolam is extracted into n-hexane. The organic phase is evaporated and reconstituted in n-butyl acetate, and the midazolam is quantified by gas-liquid chromatography with electron-capture detection. The calibration graph for midazolam was linear in the ranges 5-200 and 200-800 micrograms/L. The CVs for precision and reproducibility of the assay were less than 8%. The method was very specific for midazolam; most of the drugs commonly used in anesthesia and in the intensive-care unit did not interfere with the assay. The lowest detectable concentration was 1 microgram/L. The method is adaptable for use with an automated chromatographic system.", 
    "74": "Synaptosomes, purified from rat cerebral cortex, were prelabeled with [3H]inositol to study phosphatidylinositol turnover in nerve terminals. Labeled synaptosomes were either depolarized with 40 mM K+ or exposed to carbamoylcholine (carbachol). K+ depolarization increased the level of inositol phosphates in a time-dependent manner. The inositol trisphosphate concentration increased rapidly and transiently, reaching maximum (250% of control) in less than 3 sec and returning to near basal levels by 30 sec. The inositol bisphosphate level also increased rapidly, but its elevated level (220% of control) was sustained during continued depolarization. The elevated level of inositol bisphosphate was reversed upon repolarization of the synaptosomes. The level of inositol monophosphate increased slowly to 120-130% of control. These effects of K+ depolarization depended on the presence of Ca2+ in the incubation medium. Carbachol stimulated the turnover of phosphatidylinositol in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The level of inositol trisphosphate increased only slightly (120-130% of control) during carbachol stimulation. The level of inositol bisphosphate increased to 210% of control, and this maximal response was seen from 15 to 60 min. Accumulation of inositol monophosphate (250% of control) was larger than that of inositol bisphosphate, but its time course was slower. Atropine and pirenzepine inhibited the carbachol effect with high affinities of 0.8 nM and 16 nM, respectively, indicating that the effect of carbachol was mediated by activation of a M1 muscarinic receptor. Incubation of synaptosomes in Ca2+-free buffer reduced the response to carbachol by 30%, and addition of EGTA abolished it. These data show that both Ca2+ influx and M1 muscarinic receptor activation stimulate phospholipase C activity in synaptosomes, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol turnover may be involved in regulating neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals.", 
    "75": "Fifteen drugs were assessed for their ability to interact with calf eye melanosomes and to inhibit synthetic L-DOPA-melanin-catalyzed oxidation-reduction reactions. All drugs were able to bind to calf eye melanosomes. The Scatchard plots of the saturation binding data were curvilinear. At a free drug concentration of 0.1 mM, binding ranged between 0.8 nmol/mg for pirenzepine and 71 nmol/mg for chloroquine, a compound which has been described as provoking toxic side-effects in melanin-containing tissues and adjacent structures. As a result of its electron transfer properties, synthetic L-DOPA melanin catalyzes the NADH oxidation/ferricyanide reduction reaction. Except for (-)-norepinephrine, which underwent rapid oxidation in the presence of ferricyanide, all of the investigated drugs were also able to inhibit this catalytic activity of L-DOPA-melanin. The degree of inhibition is dictated by the extent of binding rather than by the chemical nature of the drug itself. Chlorpromazine itself was able to catalyze the oxidation-reduction reaction and has been proposed to shunt normal electron transport sequences in vivo. The implications of melanin binding with respect to drug toxicity are discussed in the light of the present observations.", 
    "76": "The effect of midazolam on the hypoxic ventilatory response of eight healthy volunteers was examined during isocapnic rebreathing. The magnitude of the slope of the ventilatory response to hypoxia (VE vs SaO2) decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.24 to 0.70 +/- 0.13 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1) (means +/- SE, P less than 0.005) after midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV. The calculated ventilation at an arterial saturation of 90% also decreased from 28.6 +/- 4.4 to 19.9 +/- 2.7 L/min (P less than 0.05). Before midazolam, hypoxia to an SaO2 of 75 +/- 2% was associated with a 23 +/- 3 beats/min increase in heart rate; after midazolam, the increase in heart rate with hypoxia was only 4 +/- 2 beats/min (P less than 0.001). Additionally, a double-blind crossover study evaluated the effect of physostigmine on awareness and hypoxic ventilatory response after midazolam. The change in hypoxic response slope after physostigmine 2.0 mg IV (an increase of 0.28 +/- 0.34 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1] did not differ significantly from that after placebo (an increase of 0.03 +/- 0.22 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1], although physostigmine significantly increased awareness. It is concluded that a sedative dose of midazolam depresses hypoxic ventilatory response and attenuates the hyperpnea and tachycardia associated with hypoxemia. Furthermore, physostigmine-glycopyrrolate reversal of midazolam-induced sedation was associated with nausea (five subjects), vomiting (three subjects), and tachycardia without reversal of the depressed hypoxic ventilatory response.", 
    "77": "We report a family with branchial myoclonus, spastic paraparesis, and cerebellar ataxia in which six members were affected in two generations and the inheritance appeared to be autosomal dominant. Age at onset ranged from 40 to 50 years. Rhythmic myoclonus involving the palate, pharynx, larynx, and face was followed by truncal ataxia and spastic paraparesis in most patients. CT and MRI revealed mild atrophy of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex and severe atrophy of the medulla and spinal cord. The pons appeared normal and the olives not hypertrophic. CSF studies revealed severe reduction of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Treatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan and carbidopa at highest tolerated dose mildly improved ataxia but did not modify the myoclonus. Treatment with anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, phenytoin, valproate, carbamazepine, and baclofen was unsuccessful. The clinical symptoms were progressive, leading to death or severe disability 5 to 10 years after the onset of the disease.", 
    "78": "In a randomised controlled study in 16 orthopaedic patients, the influence of midazolam-fentanyl-N2O/O2 anesthesia (group A) resp. halothane-N2O/O2 anesthesia (group B) on the plasma concentrations of the endocrine parameters ACTH, aldosterone, cortisol, 17-DHEA, insulin, prolactin, T3, T4, TBG (thyroxine bounded globuline) as well as adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine was investigated. Additionally the metabolites glucose, lactate, free glycerin, and acetacetate were measured. Beside prolactin values, only the values for ACTH, aldosterone, cortisol, and 17-DHEA differed with respect to both anesthesia methods. Under halothane-N2O/O2 anesthesia free T4 rose initially also, here represented by T4/TBG-ratio (= FTI). However, the fall of T3 concentration showed no phase - resp. anesthesia-specific changes. Catecholamine levels reached highest values towards the end of operation resp. one hour after extubation in both groups. The insulin secretion, however, was not significantly raised in either group during acute stress phases. As an expression of modified metabolic regulation comparable rises of plasma levels of glucose, lactate, free glycerin, and acetacetate were observed under midazolam-fentanyl-N2O/O2 anesthesia as well as under halothane-N2O/O2. According to presented data, both methods of anesthesia modulated the endocrine metabolic response of the organism to surgical stress, without showing any clinically relevant advantages or disadvantages attributable to either method.", 
    "79": "In a six week, double-blind, parallel study of alprazolam and amitriptyline hydrochloride in 130 outpatients suffering from moderate to severe nonpsychotic depression, alprazolam was as effective as amitriptyline hydrochloride in relieving depressive symptoms and significantly more effective in relieving symptoms of anxiety and somatization. Alprazolam showed an earlier onset of activity in most measurements of efficacy and produced fewer side effects than amitriptyline hydrochloride. Anticholinergic side effects were reported more frequently by patients taking amitriptyline hydrochloride, while drowsiness was reported more frequently by patients taking alprazolam. At the end of the study, the average daily doses were 2.4 mg alprazolam and 135 mg amitriptyline hydrochloride. The Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Physician's Global Impressions, Patients' Global Impressions, Hopkins Self-Rating Symptom Scale, and Symptom and Side Effects Checklist were evaluated at the end of weeks 1, 2, 3 and 6 to determine and compare the efficacy and safety of the two study drugs."
