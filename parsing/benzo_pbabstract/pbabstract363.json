A Protein G column and antibodies to benzodiazepines were used to screen library components. A pH change in the mobile phase eluted the benzodiazepine-antibody complexes onto a C-18 restricted access media (RAM) column, thereby separating the selected benzodiazepines from the antibody. In a final step, backflushing the RAM column eluted the benzodiazepines onto a C-8 analytical reversed-phase column for separation before detection and preliminary structural characterization using ion spray mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/ MS). A known 19-component library and an unknown 20-component library were analyzed. Full-scan IAE/LC/ LC/MS and IAE/LC/LC/MS/MS chromatograms suggested the feasibility of this combination of techniques, although the antibodies used were not highly specific. Inspection of MS/MS spectra of components in the unknown library compared to the MS/MS spectrum of a known standard (chlordiazepoxide) identified a subclass of benzodiazepines. Productions of the known standard and an unknown benzodiazepine were successively captured and fragmented (MSn experiments) using an iontrap mass spectrometer off-line, which confirmed that the unknown was an analogue of chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "1": "The present study investigated the effects of perinatal flumazenil (Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), given from gestational day 15 to the 14th day after giving birth, at two doses (3.5 and 6.3 mg/kg/ day) on the behavior of female RLA/Verh rats. This rat line has been selectively bred for non-acquisition of two-way active avoidance. Offspring of treated/non-treated dams were tested when adults for two-way active (shuttle box) avoidance acquisition. For comparison reasons additional offspring coming from the same treatments were used in an hyponeophagia test and in both an open field and a plus maze tests. The results show that perinatal flumazenil, specially the lower dose (and also the highest dose, although only in the final phases of the shuttle box training) was able to improve two-way active avoidance acquisition, as it has been previously found with males, whereas it failed to show any effect in the hyponeophagia task, the open field and the plus-maze tests. As two-way active avoidance acquisition can be enhanced both by reducing emotionality/anxiety or by improving memory, it is suggested that flumazenil treatment could have affected either one or both processes.", 
    "2": "Behavioral analysis in animal models appears to be a valuable and sensitive tool for detecting subtle alterations in CNS function, which can be produced by early exposure to small perturbations of sensory experience, hormonal milieu, or exposure to psychotropic agents devoid of major teratogenic potential. Concerning anxiolytics, the more recent work in mice, which is here summarized, was carried out by putting the emphasis on changes in naturally occurring species-typical social responses as a function of early exposure to benzodiazepines. For adult females, on the behavior expressed during the early postpartum period, whereas for infant subjects, on the ontogenetic stage of the establishment of social bonding. Critical issues such as the choice of fostering procedure and rearing conditions are also addressed. Evidences of relationships between changes in social milieu taking place during early rearing-i.e., when dramatic transitions in the neurochemical target system occur- and the adult behavioral response to challenges with BDZ agents are presented. These data strengthen the notion that the modes of reaction of adult animals to the joint influence of physiological and environmental (stimulus) variables are under the influence of events in early ontogenesis. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms-as unveiled by an appropriate use of drug tools-that mediate such a plasticity might have considerable psychobiological and clinical-therapeutical relevance.", 
    "3": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that often occurs as a consequence of acute or chronic liver failure. Previous reports have suggested that alterations in amino acid neurotransmission, particularly glutamate, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HE. The objectives of the present study were to test the hypothesis that extracellular glutamate concentration is increased during HE, and to determine if flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, alters the extracellular concentration of glutamate during HE. The experimental approach involved using microdialysis probes to measure rat hippocampal extracellular glutamate concentration. HE was brought about as a result of thioacetamide-induced liver failure. Thioacetamide produced behavioral and metabolic effects, such as somnolence, hyperventilation and hyperammonemia, consistent with stage three HE. Comparison with saline-treated rats demonstrated that HE was associated with a significant increase (p = 0.010) in extracellular hippocampal glutamate concentration. Administration of flumazenil caused a transient increase in arousal level, but did not affect the increase in glutamate concentration (p = 0.93). These results corroborate the theory that glutamate neurotransmission is altered during HE and suggest that the flumazenil arousal of HE rats is not mediated by a change in extracellular glutamate concentration.",

We describe a 23-year-old woman under treatment with clobazam who developed lesions of TEN in light-exposed areas. Patch and photopatch tests with clobazam were negative. The cellular phenotype and cytokines were studied in blister fluid. The cellular infiltrate was composed mainly of T lymphocytes with a predominant cytotoxic phenotype. There was an increase in the level of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in blister fluid compared with the control (a patient with bullous pemphigoid).", 
    "5": "The effects of the AMPA-receptor antagonists NBQX and GYKI 52466 were compared with those of the NMDA-receptor channel blocker dizocilpine in two drug discrimination tests. In the first, rats were trained to discriminate morphine (2 mg/kg) from saline and in the second, to discriminate ketamine (7 mg/kg) from saline, using a two-lever food reinforced method. NBQX (1-6 mg/kg) did not substitute for either morphine or ketamine, even at a dose which reduced response rates (6 mg/kg). Likewise, the noncompetitive antagonist GYKI 52466 (5 and 10 mg/kg) produced only saline lever responding in the ketamine trained rats. When tested in combination with the training drug, NBQX (4.5 mg/kg) did not alter the morphine generalisation gradient, and similarly, neither NBQX (3 mg/kg) nor GYKI 52466 (5 and 10 mg/kg) interacted with the ketamine cue. In contrast, dizocilpine (0.05 mg/kg) significantly disrupted discrimination of morphine and produced clear drug lever responding (0.0125-0.1 mg/kg) in ketamine trained rats. These results suggest that AMPA-receptor antagonists and non-competitive NMDA-antagonists have different stimulus properties.", 
    "6": "In the present study, the effects of 5-HT1A receptor ligands with varying degrees of intrinsic activity at the 5-HT1A receptor were examined in the conditioned emotional response (CER) test and their effects compared to those of the benzodiazepine receptor agonists, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. Diazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (3.0 mg/kg), and the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists, ipsapirone (10.0 mg/kg) and gepirone (3.0 mg/kg), alleviated conditioned suppression of lever pressing. The 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, buspirone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.01-0.10 mg/kg), and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY-100635 (0.03-3.0 mg/kg), had no effects on conditioned fear. Neither enhancing the level of food deprivation nor pretreatment with the amnesic agent scopolamine induced anxiolytic-like effects in the present CER test. The anxiolytic-like effects of ipsapirone in this test were completely reversed by WAY-100635. These results indicate that 5-HT1A agonist, but not antagonist actions, induce an anxiolytic effect in the CER test in rats.", 
    "7": "Neuroactive steroidal modulation of immobilization-stress and possible involvement of GABA-A and mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptors (MDR) has been investigated in mice. Immobilization of mice for 2 h induced intense antinociception, anxiety state, and associated with a fall in adrenal ascorbic acid levels. Pretreatment with high dose of progesterone (10 mg/kg), a precursor of neurosteroids, significantly decreased the stress-induced antinociception, anxiety and fall in adrenal ascorbic acid, while low doses (1 and 5 mg/kg) or hydrocortisone (10 and 100 mg/kg) were ineffective. In contrast, progesterone (1 mg/kg, for 9 days) produced a significant antistress effect, which was blocked by GABA-A antagonists picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) and bicuculline (1 mg/kg), but not by flumazenil (2 mg/kg), a specific benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist. 4'-chlordiazepam (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg), a specific high affinity MDR agonist, produced significant anti-stress effect in a flumazenil-insensitive manner, but was blocked by pretreatment with PK11195 (1.5 mg/kg), a selective partial agonist of MDR, and with bicuculline (1 mg/kg), a potent GABA-A receptor antagonist. At higher doses, progesterone and 4'-chlordiazepam which are effective in immobilization stress also reduced locomotion. However, lower doses of progesterone (6.5 mg/kg) neither affected locomotion, nor produced any motor toxicity on rota-rod test. At the lower doses, the MDR ligand 4'-chlordiazepam (50 micrograms/kg) decreased locomotor activity, without altering motor toxicity on rota-rod test. Further, the per se effects of these treatments on unstressed mice were not significantly different from those of untreated controls, except for plus-maze test. The antistress profile of progesterone may be attributed to the in vivo production of neurosteroid allopregnanolone, thus resembled that of BZDs. Furthermore, the antistress actions are flumazenil-resistant, reaffirming that there may be an increase in the levels of pregnane neurosteroids in vivo, which may act on a specific allosteric site on GABA-A receptors distinct from BZD site. Because 4'-chlordiazepam binds to MDRs and stimulate mitochondrial neurosteroidogenesis, the anti-stress effects of 4'-chlordiazepam may be imputed to its MDR-induced neurosteroids, which then act on GABA-A receptors. These data suggest a pivotal role for GABA-A and mitochondrial DBI receptors in the antistress actions of neurosteroids and reinforces their ameliorative effect in physiological stress.", 
    "8": "Following stressor exposure BALB/cByJ mice exhibit hypersecretion of corticosterone and marked brain catecholamine alterations. In addition, mice of this strain exhibit impairments of performance in a Morris water-maze, which may be exacerbated by footshock application. In the present investigation it was demonstrated that early-life handling of mouse pups (coupled with brief separation periods from the dam over the course of 21 days postpartum) reduced the learning impairments seen when mice were tested in the Morris water-maze at 120 days of age and also prevented stress-induced disturbances in this task. Likewise, cross-fostering BALB/cByJ mice with a C57BL/6ByJ dam prevented the performance deficits. In contrast, C57BL/6ByJ mice cross-fostered to a BALB/cByJ dam exhibited proficient performance. Thus, maternal factors may be important in determining the Morris water-maze disturbances, provided that this was applied on the BALB/cByJ genetic background. Stressor exposure exacerbated the performance disturbances in BALB/cByJ mice, while diazepam treatment disrupted Morris water-maze performance in both BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6ByJ mice. Paralleling the behavioral changes associated with handling, the stress-induced hypercorticosterone secretion characteristic of the BALB/cByJ mouse was attenuated by the early handling procedure. Stressor exposure also produced strain-dependent variations of NE and 5-HT, but these effects were not appreciably influenced by the handling procedure. These data are consistent with the proposition that performance disturbances of BALB/cByJ mice tested in the Morris water-maze task are associated with excessive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal reactivity. Moreover, it appears that the influence of early-life stimulation may interact with genetic factors in determining endocrine and behavioral stress responses.", 
    "9": "Positron emission tomography and compartmental models allow the in vivo analysis of radioligand binding to receptor sites in the human brain. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was studied using a three-compartmental model and [11C]flumazenil. Four and five parameters were estimated from a single kinetic curve obtained with a multi-injection protocol, and parametric maps of receptor density and of the individual kinetic parameters were created with four-pixel sampling of the experimental images. The coefficient of variation on each estimated model parameter was calculated using the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix. However, these estimates are valid only under some statistical hypotheses which are not always verified with PET data. Thus, in order to verify the validity of the coefficient of variation of each parameter calculated with the covariance matrix, these results have been compared with the more rigorous statistical results provided by a Monte Carlo simulation. The study showed a negligible difference between the results obtained by the two methods for a low noise level in time-concentration curves encountered using large ROIs. However, this bias becomes less negligible when the noise level is high and some estimations of the coefficients of variation were unacceptable (> 100%) with the five-parameter model. Such difficulties did not occur with the four-parameter model which led to parametric images with good quality and acceptable estimates of coefficients of variation (less than 20% in about 75% of the ROIs).", 
    "10": "Effects of various forms of stress on the GABAA receptor-chloride ionophore complex in the brain of NMRI mice were investigated. Male albino mice were subjected to stress by placing them on small platforms (SP; 3.5 cm diameter) surrounded by water for 24 h. This experimental model contains several stress factors like rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation, isolation, immobilization, falling into water and soaking. As additional stress control groups we used animals subjected to isolation, large platform (9.0 cm diameter) and repeated swimming stress. SP stress induced an increase in the number of cortical benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors and a reduction in the GABA-stimulated 36Cl-uptake by brain microsacs, whereas none of these changes could be observed in animals exposed to isolation, swimming or large platform stresses. Furthermore, the amount of GABA-induced stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was reduced in cortical brain membranes of SP-stressed animals, an effect due to fact that these animals displayed an increase in the basal [3H]flunitrazepam binding, whereas the absolute level of maximally enhanced BDZ binding in the presence of GABA did not differ from those found in controls. Neither basal [3H]muscimol binding or thiopentone sodium-induced stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding were changed in any group of stressed mice. It is proposed that the observed upregulation in the number (Bmax) of cortical BDZ receptors in SP-stressed mice may represent a compensatory response to a stress-induced attenuation of GABAergic neurotransmission.",

Patients suffering from both disorders have more psychological, physical, and social impairment than do patients suffering from either illness alone. Mixed anxiety-depression is gaining recognition as a separate diagnosis and has been included in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, and in the appendix of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. Current treatment recommendations for comorbid depression and anxiety are based on clinical experience with the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders when they occur independently. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective for simultaneously occurring anxiety and depression, but the side-effect profiles of the MAOIs and TCAs limit their use for this condition. Benzodiazepines are useful for the acute treatment of anxiety symptoms and buspirone for chronic generalized anxiety, but neither agent is effective for the long-term treatment of depression. The recently available antidepressants nefazodone and venlafaxine may also be useful for this patient population. When possible, psychotherapy should be used in conjunction with pharmacotherapy to improve treatment outcomes.",

Additional boluses of alfentanil, 1 mg, were administered before noxious stimuli; group 2 (n = 25) received a loading dose of fentanyl, 25 micrograms/kg, midazolam, 1.5 to 3 mg, and pancuronium, 0.1 mg/kg for induction, followed by an infusion of fentanyl, 7 micrograms/kg/h, for maintenance. Additional boluses of midazolam (1.5 to 3 mg) and fentanyl (250 micrograms) were administered before noxious stimuli. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS. Cardiovascular parameters at eight intraoperative time points as well as time to extubation, morphine consumption, and pain scores were recorded. Induction of anesthesia was associated in both groups with a small but significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (1: 15 mmHg (15%); 2: 8 mmHg (8%) with significant decreases in cardiac index (1: 8%; 2: 8%) and left ventricular stroke work index (1: 24%; 2: 21%). Throughout surgery, hemodynamic profiles were comparable between groups except after intubation when the MAP was significantly lower in group 1 (75 +/- 12 mmHg) than in group 2 (89 +/- 17 mmHg). Group 1 required less inotropic support. Extubation was performed faster in group 1 (7.6 h) than in group 2 (18.0 h). Morphine requirements and pain scores were comparable between groups.",

    "25": "Sedation is currently administered to neonates experiencing pain and stress during intensive care for medical diseases, as well as postoperatively. Drugs commonly used for sedation in neonates include benzodiazepines (midazolam and lorazepam), chloral hydrate and opioids (fentanyl and morphine). Sedation protocols and dosage schedules are, in most cases, adapted from those which have been developed in children and even adults. The effectiveness and safety of the sedative agents remain underevaluated, however, due to the difficulties of quantifying pain and stress in neonates, and because of the limited use of validated scoring methods by practitioners. Among the benzodiazepines, midazolam is probably the drug of choice for continuous sedation. However, its elimination is delayed in the neonatal period and hypotension may occur when given as a bolus injection or when taken with opioids. Lorazepam requires further evaluation to exclude severe neurotoxicity. Chloral hydrate is administered orally, but because of its delayed elimination and risk of accumulation, a single administration for short term sedation is recommended. Among opioids, fentanyl (which was initially administered for postoperative analgesia) is now prescribed for sedation during mechanical ventilation. Tolerance and dependence may develop rapidly, limiting its usefulness for prolonged sedation. Although extensively studied in neonates, the efficacy and safety of morphine are not clearly determined, because of the limited number of patients included in individual studies. In addition, important interindividual differences in metabolism render dosage recommendations difficult. Alfentanil and sufentanil need further investigations to define their pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties in neonates. Although the choice of drug is important, the way the drug is used and monitored is equally important. All the drugs used for the sedation of neonates have large inter- and intraindividual differences in disposition, justifying specific pharmacological knowledge and individual dosage adjustments based on clinical evaluation of the patient and the monitoring of drug concentrations.", 
    "26": "The binding characteristics of KNI-272, a potent and selective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor, were evaluated in rat and human plasma, and in solutions of human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA). The unbound fractions (Fu) of KNI-272 were 12.13 and 2.24% in rat and human plasma, respectively, at the drug concentration of 1.0 microgram mL-1. Although KNI-272 binds to both AAG and HSA, the Fu of KNI-272 in AAG solution was 1.83%, and only one-quarter of that in HSA solution (Fu = 6.78%). Binding displacing agents, such as disopyramide, warfarin, diazepam, and digitoxin, were used to determine the binding site of KNI-272 on these plasma proteins. The Fu of KNI-272 in AAG solution increased 14-fold when disopyramide was added to the AAG solution. In addition, warfarin, diazepam, and digitoxin were added to HSA solution as representative drugs bound to distinct binding sites on HSA, namely sites I, II, and III, respectively. The Fu values of KNI-272 in HSA solution significantly increased when warfarin and diazepam were added. In particular, with the addition of warfarin to HSA solution, the Fu of KNI-272 increased to 16%. The modified Scatchard plots of KNI-272 binding to AAG and HSA both showed biphasic curves, and the KNI-272 binding sites at low concentration range on AAG and HSA disappeared with the addition of disopyramide and warfarin, respectively. Therefore, it is considered that KNI-272 binds to the identical site as disopyramide on AAG and site I on HSA in the low KNI-272 concentration range. By comparing the KNI-272 binding parameters obtained in human plasma and these protein solutions, we can assume that KNI-272 binding at low concentration in human plasma is mainly concerned with the binding on AAG. As KNI-272 concentration in plasma increases, HSA becomes concerned with KNI-272 binding.",

We used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to compare the functional and pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons from the control or diazepam-tolerant rats. Administration of diazepam (15 mg/kg p.o.) twice a day for 10 days induced tolerance as demonstrated by the decreased potency of acute diazepam i.p. injections to protect against pentylenetetrazole-induced clonictonic convulsions (10.5% of tolerant rats protected by 0.1 mg/kg of diazepam against 55% of nontreated rats, 48 hr after the last dose of the chronic treatment). The specific current induced by 1 microM GABA in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons 48 hr after withdrawal (10.5 +/- 1.3 microA/cm2) was similar to that observed in the control rats (8.7 +/- 0.8 microA/cm2). The EC50 value for GABA was unchanged by the chronic treatment [6.3 (5.4-7.1) and 7.5 (6.2-8.7) microM in neurons from the control and treated rats, respectively]. The potency of the nonselective allosteric modulator diazepam to stimulate Cl- currents was identical in cells from treated rats [EC50 values of 25 (20-30) and 34 (26-41) nM in the control and treated rats, respectively; P < .05], but the potency of the selective BZ1-site ligand zolpidem was decreased [EC50 values of 99 (88-111) and 267 (221-313) nM in the control and treated rats, respectively; P < .05]. The maximal potentiation of the GABA-induced current was significantly decreased with diazepam (maximal potentiation: 168.0 +/- 16.2 and 124.0 +/- 8.9% in the control and treated rats, respectively). These results suggest that tolerance to diazepam is accompanied in hippocampal neurons by a decrease in BZ1 binding sites and in the functional coupling of BZ/GABA recognition sites.",

    "39": "Diltiazem slows elimination of midazolam and alfentanil and may delay tracheal extubation after large doses of these anesthetic adjuncts. CYP3A-mediated drug interactions should be considered as confounders when recovery from anesthesia with midazolam and alfentanil infusions is assessed.", 
    "40": "1. Extracellular recordings from rat mesenteric paravascular nerve bundles were made in order to characterize the responses of different populations of afferents supplying the small intestine to intravenous cholecystokinin (CCK; in the form of sulphated CCK8). 2. Approximately 70% of mesenteric nerve bundles contained CCK-sensitive afferent fibres. Responsive afferents had low spontaneous discharge (1.6 +/- 0.3 impulses s-1) and showed a 14-fold increase in firing at the peak of the response to 50 pmol CCK with the overall response lasting several minutes. The onset of the response occurred after a latency of (3.9 +/- 0.1 s) following i.v. administration of CCK, which corresponds largely to the circulation delay in these animals. The threshold dose of CCK was < 5 pmol. 3. The response to 100 pmol CCK was completely abolished by devazepide (0.5 mg kg-1) and by chronic subdiaphragmatic vagotomy performed 10-14 days prior to experimentation, indicating that CCK sensitivity was via CCKA receptors and exclusively mediated via vagal afferents rather than splanchnic or enteric afferents. 4. Evidence that CCK-sensitive afferents had mucosal receptive fields was indicated by the lack of any response to luminal distension and the sensitivity of the CCK response to luminal anaesthesia. Furthermore, CCK-sensitive afferents responded to luminal hydrochloric acid (50 mM) in a slowly adapting manner. The response to acid was significantly reduced (P < 0.005), but not abolished, by devazepide at a time when the response to exogenous CCK had been completely eliminated. 5. The exquisite sensitivity of some vagal mucosal afferents to CCK suggests that they may play a physiological role in the reflex and behavioural consequences of CCK release from the small intestine, possibly acting in a paracrine fashion. However, this sensitivity to CCK represents only one aspect of the broad chemosensitivity of these mucosal afferents and is not an obligatory component of the signal transduction pathway.", 
    "41": "Haloperidol and lorazepam are commonly used to sedate ethanol (E)-intoxicated patients in emergency departments. This study was conducted to explore the role of ethanol in altering the potency of haloperidol and lorazepam with respect to cardiac conduction and contraction. For mechanical studies, isolated rat hearts were studied under isovolumetric conditions by using standard Langendorff technique. Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Heinseleit-Bicarbonate buffer containing haloperidol or lorazepam in concentrations ranging from 100 to 750 ng/ml (one heart per drug concentration). For both haloperidol and lorazepam individually, significant reductions in Left ventricular-generated pressure (LVGP) were observed at a concentration of 750 ng/ml (haloperidol = 2,250 nM and lorazepam = 2,000 nM). The addition of 20 and 65 mM ethanol shifted the concentration-response effect of haloperidol such that LVGP was significantly reduced at haloperidol = 500 and 300 ng/ml, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. basal control; paired t test). Ethanol produced no observable shift on the lorazepam concentration-response for LVGP. For electrophysiologic studies, hearts were perfused with haloperidol and lorazepam (300 ng/ml) +/- 65 mM ethanol. Compared with basal control, E + H significantly decreased heart rate (-74 +/- 12 beats/min) and increased His-ventricular conduction time (+7.6 +/- 1.5 ms vs. +1.7 +/- 0.6 ms for control hearts). Both haloperidol and EH significantly increased atrioventricular (AV) effective refractory period and the atrioventricular-His (AH) conduction interval. No significant changes in any electrophysiologic parameter were observed with ethanol or lorazepam perfused individually or with the combination of ethanol and lorazepam. Ethanol potentiates haloperidol-induced electromechanical depression of isolated rat hearts. Ethanol had no such effect on lorazepam.", 
    "42": "Benzodiazepines are frequently administered postmyocardial infarction, but their effect on heart period variability (HPV), a prognostic index of sudden arrhythmogenic death, is unclear. In fact, in both humans and animals, previous studies utilizing acute intravenous doses yielded mixed results. We hypothesized that lorazepam (LZ), by potentiating gamma-aminobutyric acid-A-ergic inhibition of preganglionic vagal neurons projecting to the heart, would reduce cardiac vagal modulation. We therefore tested LZ's effect on HPV over 24 hours of normal physiologic activity in human volunteers in the presence of steady-state LZ. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Seven healthy subjects received LZ or placebo for 1 week, 1 week taper, then crossed over. Electrocardiogram recordings measured HPV after the administration of drug and placebo for 24 hours. LZ increased mean heart rate by 8% (p < 0.002), decreased the standard deviation of R-R intervals by 9% (p < 0.05), decreased the percent differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals > 50 msec by 30% (p < 0.002), decreased the root-mean-square successive difference by 17% (p < 0.02), and decreased the natural logarithm of high-frequency power by 6% (p < 0.03). The significant heart rate increase and HPV decreases demonstrate vagolytic effects of LZ in healthy subjects during 24 hours of normal physiologic activity.", 
    "43": "Epilepsy research using positron emission tomography (PET) has provided considerable new information about ictal and interictal dysfunctions in human epilepsy. Neuroreceptor mapping with PET ligands has revealed altered central benzodiazepine receptor and opiate receptor densities in partial epilepsies interictally, and regional increases in endogenous opioid peptide concentrations during absence seizures. Imaging of perfusion and glucose metabolism during cognitive processing has shown interictal abnormalities of regional activation in partial and generalized epilepsies. The diagnostically robust patterns of interictal glucose hypometabolism are not adequately explained by macrostructural and microstructural alterations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Current investigations of the pathophysiology of interictal hypometabolism must address ultrastructural and neurochemical factors. Clinical PET in presurgical evaluation of medically refractory epilepsies remains an active area of research, but remarkably little antiepileptic drug research has exploited PET techniques.", 
    "44": "The direct effect of acetylcholine on pituitary growth hormone secretion during the postnatal period of the rat was studied using a superfusion system. Acetylcholine elicited a dose related stimulatory effect on growth hormone (GH) secretion in the pituitaries from 2-day old rats. M1 muscarinic agonist McN A343 mimicked the GH releasing effect of acetylcholine, nicotine was ineffective. The GH release elicited by acetylcholine diminished with postnatal development, it was small by the end of the third postnatal week and was not demonstrable in the adult pituitaries. The effect of acetylcholine was potently antagonized by pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) and 4-DAMP (M3 and M1 antagonist) but not by methoctramine (M2 antagonist). It is concluded that unlike in the adult, in the newborn rat the cholinergic regulation of pituitary GH secretion plays a prominent role directly at pituitary level most likely via M1 receptors.", 
    "45": "A study of 16 deaths associated with toxic concentrations of benzodiazepines during the period of 5 years leading up to July 1994 is presented. Cases where other drugs, including ethanol, had contributed to the death were excluded. All cases were subject to a full macroscopic and microscopic examination by pathologists, and all cases were subject to a full toxicological work-up. Preexisting natural disease was a feature of 11 cases. In the remaining five cases, death was caused solely by benzodiazepines. There were 14 suicides. Nitrazepam and temazepam were the most prevalent drugs detected, followed by oxazepam and flunitrazepam. Minimum toxic femoral blood concentrations of 7-aminonitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, and oxazepam were estimated as 0.5, 0.2, and 2 mg/L, respectively. Relating these deaths to prescription rates in Victoria suggest that flunitrazepam may be inherently more toxic if misused than other benzodiazepines currently available on the Australian market.", 
    "46": "Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that male and female rats exhibit a differential pattern of behavior in the elevated plus-maze as a function of age. In the present study, the influence of individual housing conditions on young animals treated with one of two classical anxioselective drugs, diazepam or pentylenetetrazole, was investigated in the elevated plus-maze. In Experiment I, males and females were housed for 30 days after weaning either individually or in groups, and tested in the elevated plus-maze at 60 days of age. In Experiment 2, the effects of diazepam (0.75 or 1.0 mg/kg) or of pentylenetetrazole (20 or 30 mg/kg) on the behavior of isolated or grouped rats were studied at 60 days of age in the elevated plus-maze. The results show that isolated housed animals tested with diazepam at 60 days of age exhibited increased frequency and time spent on the open arms of the apparatus compared to control rats. The effect of diazepam was not observed in grouped animals tested at 60 days of age. Pentylenetetrazole produced a decrease in the frequency and time spent on the open arms. This effect was more prominent in grouped animals. The results suggest that 60-day-old rats deprived of playfighting experience present high basal anxiety levels and also that rearing conditions (isolated or grouped) are able to interact with both anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of experimental drugs.", 
    "47": "We examined the topography of the MA-10 Leydig tumor cell mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). In previous studies, the 18 kDa PBR was found to be functionally associated with the voltage-dependent anion channel, located in the junctions between outer and inner membranes. Transmission electron (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) of immunogold labeled PBR on Leydig cell mitochondrial preparations showed that the 18 kDa PBR protein is organized in clusters of 4-6 molecules. Addition of hCG to Leydig cells induces a rapid, within 30 sec, increase in PBR ligand binding and morphological changes, namely redistribution of PBR molecules in large clusters (>7 particles). These hCG-induced changes were inhibited by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor and by the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam. AFM further demonstrated the rapid reorganization of the mitochondrial membrane, where the formation of contacts between the outer and the inner mitochondrial membrane may facilitate cholesterol transfer.", 
    "48": "Glucocorticoid excess has broad pathogenic potential including neurotoxicity, neuroendangerment, and immunosuppression. Glucocorticoid synthesis is regulated by ACTH, which acts by accelerating the transport of the precursor cholesterol to the mitochondria where steroidogenesis begins. Ginkgo biloba is one of the most ancient trees, and extracts from its leaves have been used in traditional medicine. A standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, termed EGb 761 (EGb), has been shown to have neuroprotective and antistress effects. In vivo treatment of rats with EGb, and its bioactive components ginkgolide A and B, specifically reduces the ligand binding capacity, protein, and messenger RNA expression of the adrenocortical mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a key element in the regulation of cholesterol transport, resulting in decreased corticosteroid synthesis. As expected, the ginkgolide-induced decrease in glucocorticoid levels resulted in increased ACTH release, which in turn induced the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. Because ginkgolides reduced the adrenal PBR expression and corticosterone synthesis despite the presence of high levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, these data demonstrate that PBR is indispensable for normal adrenal function. In addition, these results suggest that manipulation of PBR expression could control circulating glucocorticoid levels, and that the antistress and neuroprotective effects of EGb are caused by to its effect on glucocorticoid biosynthesis.", 
    "49": "Simultaneous to the discovery of binding sites for benzodiazepines in the central nervous system (CNS) was the observation that [3H]diazepam also bound to sites in peripheral tissues, including liver, heart, lung, adrenal, and kidney. These \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) have been well characterized, but their physiological significance remains elusive. Researchers have discovered candidates that may serve as endogenous ligands for the PBR. The PBR is both tonically and phasically regulated by neural and hormonal mechanisms. This site also appears to be a critical factor in the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis, the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in a variety of tissues. In addition, the tissue-specific, stress-induced regulation of renal PBR coupled with the pharmacological simulation of these effects by angiotensin II suggest that the physiological significance of this site in kidney may be related to the pathophysiology of hypertension. The potential relevance of these findings for the development of novel pharmacotherapies for stress-related disorders in humans such as hypertension is discussed.", 
    "50": "The anxiogenic benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG7142 increases dopamine turnover in rodent prefrontal cortex but not in other dopamine terminal field areas. FG7142-induced increases in prefrontal cortical dopamine receptor stimulation impair prefrontal-dependent, but not nonprefrontal-dependent, cognitive tasks in rats and monkeys. The degree of impairment correlates with levels of prefrontal cortical dopamine turnover in rats and can be blocked in rats and monkeys with dopamine receptor antagonists, suggesting that increased dopamine turnover is directly related to the cognitive deficits. The current study examined nondopaminergic drug effects on FG7142-perturbed biochemistry and cognition. Both the noradrenergic alpha-2 agonist clonidine and the glycine/NMDA antagonist (+)HA966 prevented the FG7142-induced increase in dopamine turnover in rodent prefrontal cortex. Infusion of (+)HA966 into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) also blocked this increase in dopamine turnover, indicating that critical modulatory effects of (+)HA966 on FG7142-induced changes in dopamine turnover are occurring at the level of mesoprefrontal dopamine neuron cell bodies. Systemic (+)HA966 and clonidine, but not propranolol or D-cycloserine, prevented FG7142-associated spatial working memory deficits in rats and monkeys. These results support the idea of a critical range of dopamine turnover for optimal prefrontal cortical cognitive functioning, with excessive dopamine turnover leading to cognitive impairment. These studies also provide evidence for the regulation of prefrontal cortical dopamine turnover and cognition by multiple neurotransmitter systems and suggest that the VTA is an important regulatory site for these effects.", 
    "51": "Phellopterin, a naturally occurring furanocoumarin found in the roots of Angelica dahurica, inhibits [3H]diazepam and ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate ([3H]Ro 15-1788) binding to the benzodiazepine site of the rat brain gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor in vitro with IC50 values of 400 and 680 nM, respectively. Two other naturally occurring furanocoumarins, byakangelicol and imperatorin were significantly less potent, with IC50 values for inhibition of [3H]diazepam binding of 8.0 and 12.3 microM, respectively. Scatchard plot analysis showed that the inhibitory activity of phellopterin was due to competitive inhibition of the benzodiazepine ligand binding. The results of GABA- and t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS)-shift assays suggest that phellopterin is a partial agonist of the central benzodiazepine receptors in vitro.", 
    "52": "Apart from its role in fast inhibitory transmission, only neurotrophic effects have been reported following activation of the GABAA receptor. Here, we show that n-butyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and n-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide, which are negative allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor acting at the benzodiazepine site, are neurotoxic for cerebellar granule neurones in culture. The beta-carboline-induced neuronal death is apoptotic since DNA internucleosomal fragmentation was induced and the neurotoxicity could be prevented by inhibitors of mRNA or protein synthesis. As GABA and benzodiazepine ligands (diazepam and Ro 15-1788) protect cerebellar granule cells against beta-carboline-induced toxicity, these data raise the possibility that the interaction between the beta-carbolines and the GABAA receptor is the triggering event leading to neuronal apoptosis.", 
    "53": "We examined the postnatal development of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs), labelled with [3H]PK 11195, in rat brain and peripheral tissues. Specific [3H]PK 11195 binding exhibited a heterogeneous patterns of postnatal development in the rat: three patterns of increase, decrease and no change. Hence, the density of the PBRs can be independently regulated in each tissue during postnatal development, and the postnatal alterations in the density might be parallel with the functional activities coupled to the receptors.", 
    "54": "Complete prevention of the killing of L929 fibroblasts by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in the presence of 0.5 microg/ml actinomycin D (ActD) was obtained with cyclosporin A (CyA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and aristolochic acid (ArA), a phospholipase A2 inhibitor. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBzR) agonists (PK11195, FGIN 1-27, or chlorodiazepam), agents known to potentiate induction of the MPT, potentiated the cytotoxicity of TNF in the absence of ActD, an effect prevented by CyA plus ArA. The MPT was demonstrated independently of its effect on viability as the CyA-sensitive loss of rhodamine 123 fluorescence from cells preloaded with the dye. Treatment with TNF and ActD resulted in the loss of 80% of rhodamine fluorescence within 6 h, a time prior to any loss of viability. CyA plus ArA completely prevented this effect of TNF. Potentiation of the cytotoxicity of TNF by PBzR agonists was associated with induction of the MPT, as assessed by the loss of rhodamine fluorescence. CyA plus ArA completely prevented the loss of rhodamine 123. Ceramide replaced TNF in killing L929 fibroblasts, an effect also prevented by CyA plus ArA. Ceramide in the presence of ActD resulted in the loss of rhodamine fluorescence, an effect that was again prevented by CyA plus ArA. In addition, CyA plus ArA prevented the ability of PBzR agonists to potentiate the cytotoxicity of ceramide. In the presence of each PBzR agonist, ceramide caused the loss of rhodamine fluorescence, an effect completely prevented by CyA plus ArA. D609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, completely prevented the killing by TNF, but not by ceramide, in the presence of ActD. D609 prevented induction of the MPT occurring with TNF, but not with ceramide. Inhibitors of endocytosis, as well as lysosomotropic amines, prevented the cytotoxicity of TNF, but not that of ceramide. It is concluded that the MPT is causally linked to the genesis of irreversible cell injury with TNF. In the face of an inhibition of protein synthesis, the MPT occurs as a consequence of the formation of ceramide.", 
    "55": "We investigated the effects of minor and major tranquilizers on ovarian and adrenal aldo-keto reductase activity towards five substrates in relation to ovulation in mature cycling rats. Nitrazepam (NZP) did not alter ovarian and adrenal weights or body weight, although ovulation was inhibited at 5 and 10 mg/kg. NZP decreased ovarian 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin F2 alpha (15KD-PGF2 alpha) and 4-benzoylpyridine (4BP) reducing activities. None of the doses of zopiclone (ZPC) influenced uterine and adrenal weights or body weight, but it increased ovarian weight at 10 mg/kg. No significant effects of ZPC on ovarian aldo-keto reductase activity were observed. NZP had inhibitory effects on adrenal aldo-keto reductase activity, whereas ZPC had a stimulatory effect. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) did not alter ovarian or adrenal weight, whereas the estrous cycles were abolished at 5 and 10 mg/kg. Reserpine (RSP) decreased ovarian weight and completely inhibited ovulation at 5 and 10 mg/kg, but it increased adrenal weight. Both CPZ and RSP decreased, dose dependently, ovarian aldo-keto reductase activity towards five substrates in agreement with the inhibition of ovulation. On the other hand, differences were found between the effects of CPZ and RSP on adrenal aldo-keto reductase activity. CPZ significantly increased 4BP reducing activity at 5 and 10 mg/kg, although no significant changes were observed in the other four reducing activities. RSP decreased 15KD-PGF2 alpha reducing activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the other four activities did not change.", 
    "56": "An efficient convergent synthesis of a homologous series of C8-linked pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers with remarkable DNA interstrand cross-linking activity and potent in vitro cytotoxicity is reported. The \"amino thioacetal\" cyclization procedure was used to produce the electrophilic DNA-interactive N10-C11 imine moiety during the final synthetic step. In order to construct the key A-ring fragments (9a-d), a versatile convergent approach has been developed to join two units of vanillic acid with alpha,omega-dihaloalkanes of varying length to provide the required bis(4-carboxy-2-methoxyphenoxy)alkanes while avoiding the formation of mixtures of monoalkylated and bisalkylated products.", 
    "57": "A gas chromatographic-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric (GC-NCI-MS) method for the quantitative analysis of clonazepam in human plasma is described. Clonazepam (M(r) = 315) was derivatized by N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane. A pre-conditioning procedure involving injection of a silyl-8 and ethyl acetate extraction solution from plasma reduces the interaction between clonazepam-TMS and the analytical system. The routine limit of quantification was set to be 0.25 ng/ml with an injection volume of 2 microliters and a sample volume of 1 ml. The signal-to-noise ratio was greater than five. The detection limit for clonazepam can reach 0.1 ng/ml. The isotope clonazepam-d5 was used as the internal standard.", 
    "58": "Diazepam (2 x 10(-5)-6 x 10(-4) M) induced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect on the perfused rat heart which was preceded by a transient concentration-dependent negative inotropic response. The influence of the Ca(2+)-entry blocking drug, flunarizine, and the adenosine receptor blocking drug, theophylline on these inotropic responses was studied. Flunarizine in concentrations of 10(-9)-10(-6) M antagonized the positive inotropic response to diazepam significantly; the negative inotropic response was reduced as well. At the lower concentrations of diazepam the negative inotropic response was completely abolished in the presence of flunarizine. The actions of the Ca(2+)-entry blocker were related to the concentrations used. Theophylline in concentrations up to 5 x 10(-5) M did not interfere with either inotropic response to diazepam. The results suggest that Ca2+ currents in the myocardium are involved with the response of the isolated heart to diazepam. It is concluded that the finding that the negative inotropic effect of diazepam was almost abolished by flunarizine suggests that the site of this response most be associated with Ca(2+)-current mechanisms.", 
    "59": "A full-length cDNA coding for common carp diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)/endozepine (EP)/acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) was isolated and sequenced. The deduced DBI/EP/ACBP is comprised of 87 amino acids (including initiating methionine) without possessing a signal peptide. Common carp DBI/EP/ACBP displays 77%, 78%, 70%, 63%, 61% and 45% identity with human, bovine, rat, frog, duck and yeast DBI/EP/ACBP, respectively.", 
    "60": "Results are presented of a liquid chromatographic-thermospray tandem mass spectrometric method of analysing different drugs in whole blood. Substances with hypnotic, sedative and tranquillising properties from the benzodiazepine, the thioxanthene, the butyrophenone, the methadone and the diphenylbutylpiperidine groups were investigated. It appears that ten to hundred times lower detection limits for the substances in whole blood can be reached with this method compared with methods more commonly used. Detection limits in the range 10-100 pg per injection (equivalent to 0.05-0.5 ng/ml whole blood) were reached for the majority of the compounds.", 
    "61": "Marked sex differences have been reported in behavioural responses of rats 24 h after exposure to a brief period of restraint (RT) stress. In the present study, differences in benzodiazepine (BZ) binding between male and female rat litter-mates randomly allocated to control or RT groups were investigated 24 h after RT. Scatchard analysis, using [3H] flunitrazepam, was carried out on the the frontal cortex and amygdala. In the frontal cortex, females had a significantly lower affinity and a greater number of BZ receptors than males; males, but not females, showed increased affinity after RT. In the amygdala, there was a tendency towards a greater number of BZ receptors in females, with no effect of RT on receptor number or affinity. These results provide evidence of sex differences in BZ binding both under basal conditions and 24 h after RT, which could contribute to the behavioural sex differences already reported.", 
    "62": "The effects of the epileptogenic agent, picrotoxin, on both the cardiovascular responses and the dopamine (DA) release in the amygdala were studied in anesthetized rats. In vivo voltammetry was used to measure change in extracellular concentrations of DA and its metabolites in the amygdala. Intravenous administration of picrotoxin produced hypertension, increased amygdaloid DA release and behavioral syndromes (such as increased masticatory movements, salivation, and forepaw tremors). Direct administration of picrotoxin into the amygdala also induced the same effects. The picrotoxin-induced effects were suppressed by activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors with diazepam or depleting brain DA with 6-hydroxydopamine. Blockade of central DA receptors with haloperidol also attenuated the picrotoxin-induced hypertension. These results indicate that picrotoxin affects interactions between GABA neurons and DA system in rat brain to induce hypertension during an epileptic attack.", 
    "63": "A series of tetracyclic imidazoquinoxaline analogs was developed which constrain the carbonyl group of the partial agonist 3-(5-cyclopropyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-[(dimethylamino)carbonyl] - 4,5-dihydroimidazo[1,5-alpha]quinoxaline (2, U-91571) away from the benzene ring. These analogs orient the carbonyl group in the opposite direction of the previously reported full agonist 1-(5- cyclopropyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-12,12a-dihydroimidazo[1,5- alpha]pyrrolo [2,1-c]quinoxalin-10(11H)-one (3, U-89267). A number of approaches were utilized to form the \"bottom\" ring of this tetracyclic ring system including intramolecular cyclizations promoted by Lewis acids or base, as well as metal-carbenoid conditions. The size and substitution pattern of the additional ring was widely varied. Analogs within this series had high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor on the alpha-aminobutyric acid A chloride ion channel complex. From TBPS shift and Cl- current assays, the in vitro efficacy of compounds within this class ranged from antagonists to partial agonists with only 18a identified as a full agonist. Additionally, several analogs were quite potent at antagonizing metrazole-induced seizures indicating possible anticonvulsant or anxiolytic activity. Unlike 3, analogs in this series did not have high affinity for the diazepam insensitive alpha 6 beta 2 delta 2 subtype. These results suggest that either constraining the carbonyl group away from the benzene ring or the greater planarity that results from the additional cyclic structure provides analogs with partial agonist properties and prevents effective interaction with the alpha 6 beta 2 delta 2 subtype.", 
    "64": "The effect of kainate on the voltage-activated current of cultured embryonic chick telencephalic neurones was studied by whole-cell voltage clamp recording. In addition to opening non-NMDA receptor coupled ion channels, kainate produced additional effects, with a slower time course: it modulated voltage-activated currents. These effects were blocked by the non-NMDA receptor antagonists CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) and GYKI 53784 ((-)-1-(4-aminophenyl)-3- methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4- dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine), indicating that non NMDA receptors are involved. It has been shown that the reversible inhibition of outward potassium currents was partly due to a decrease of current amplitude and partly to a marked shift of the inactivation curve towards more negative potentials.", 
    "65": "The aim of this pilot study was to systematically assess the influence of bilateral, sine wave ECT on autobiographical memory of past subjective experiences related to melancholia. Twenty-one inpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for a Major Depressive Episode, Melancholic Type, were included in the study. Twelve patients were treated by ECT (12 treatments), antidepressants and benzodiazepines; the comparison group comprised 9 patients treated by antidepressants and benzodiazepines. The Structured Interview Guide for the HDRS (SIGH-D) was used at admission and after the ECT treatment to standardize data collection about subjective experiences related to the depressive episode. Memory of subjective experiences related to melancholia was assessed with free-recall, cued-recall and recognition tasks. In addition, a free recall of events of the day on which the patients came to the hospital for their treatment was administered. These tasks were administered 1 week after the last treatment in the ECT-treated group and 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the treatment in the comparison group. Free-recall, cued-recall and recognition performances were significantly lower in the ECT-treated group than in the comparison group. No significant correlation was found between memory of events related to hospital admission and memory of subjective experiences related to depression. In conclusion, bilateral, sine wave ECT impairs autobiographical memory of subjective experiences related to melancholia in subjects tested 1 week after completion of a course of ECT.", 
    "66": "The behavioral effects of several benzodiazepine (BZ) (omega) receptor ligands were compared using the Mouse Defense Test Battery which has been designed to assess defensive reactions of Swiss mice confronted with a natural threat (a rat) and situations associated with this threat. Primary measures taken before, during and after rat confrontation were escape attempts, flight, risk assessment and defensive threat and attack. The drugs used included non-selective BZ (omega) full (clonazepam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam) and partial (bretazenil and imidazenil) agonists, and BZ-1 (omega1) selective (abecarnil, CL 218,872 and zolpidem) receptor ligands. With the exception of clonazepam, non-selective BZ (omega) receptor compounds only partially affected flight behaviors. The drugs reduced some but not all flight measures in response to the approaching rat, whereas clonazepam attenuated all flight reactions. In contrast to their mild and inconsistent actions on flight, the non-selective BZ (omega) receptor agonists displayed clear effects on risk assessment when subjects were chased by the rat. When contact was forced between the subject and the rat, the non-selective BZ (omega) receptor full agonists reduced defensive threat and attack reactions, while the partial agonists imidazenil and bretazenil only weakly attenuated defensive attack behavior. Similarly, after the rat had been removed from the test area, the non-selective BZ (omega) receptor full agonists displayed greater efficacy than the partial agonists in reducing escape attempts. Overall, results obtained with the selective BZ-1 (omega1) receptor ligands demonstrated either no clear effects or no specific action on defensive reactions. Taken together, these data demonstrate that: (1) non-selective BZ (omega) agonists displaying high intrinsic activity affect a wider range of defensive behaviors than non-selective BZ (omega) receptor partial agonists; (2) the defense system does not involve primarily BZ (omega) receptors containing the alpha1-subunit.", 
    "67": "This study was designed to explore whether differences in the psychomotor, subjective and memory effects of different benzodiazepines (BDZ) relate to differences in their potencies. Two BDZs with similar kinetics but different potencies were compared. Flunitrazepam (0.5 and 1.0mg, nitrazepam (5 and 10mg) or placebo were administered to 50 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, parallel group design. Subjects completed a test battery before and 1.5h post-treatment. The higher dose of the more potent BDZ, flunitrazepam, impaired episodic memory in relation to placebo. In contrast, differences in psychomotor and subjective effects between BDZ were less clear. We conclude that a main caveat to the conclusion that potency plays a role in determining BDZ amnestic effects is the possible contribution of sedation and differential task sensitivities to apparent differential effects of BDZ compounds.", 
    "68": "This multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and consequences of progressive or abrupt withdrawal of clobazam in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in a double blind study in comparison to lorazepam and buspirone. 128 outpatients suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder according to DMS III criteria were included in the study and treated for three weeks. They were randomly divided into 4 groups: group 1: 32 patients receiving clobazam, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo; group 2: 29 patients receiving clobazam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, clobazam being replaced by a placebo; group 3: 33 patients receiving lorazepam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, lorazepam being replaced by a placebo; group 4: 34 patients receiving buspirone, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo. The dosages were increased progressively during the first week of treatment. At the end of this time, the patients received either 30 mg clobazam or 30 mg buspirone or 3 mg lorazepam daily. After the first week, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) showed a significant improvement in clobazam and lorazepam groups but not in buspirone group. All the drugs were equally effective after three weeks of treatment. The anti-anxiety activity persisted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, without any signs of rebound anxiety or withdrawal syndrome. No clinically relevant differences were found between the 4 groups regarding safety. The side-effects reported were mainly drowsiness in clobazam and lorazepam groups, nausea and headache in buspirone group. In conclusion, clobazam like lorazepam improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of therapy, efficacy was comparable with the 3 drugs and persisted after treatment discontinuation.",

Acute BDZ treatments were shown not only to suppress cell proliferation in rat thymus but also to decrease TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 release from adult mouse macrophages. In the present investigation the effects of acute (10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg) and long-term (10.0 mg kg-1 day-1, for 21 days) diazepam treatment on carrageenin-induced paw edema were studied in rats. The results showed that acute treatment with high doses of diazepam decreased paw edema volume in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was observed as early as 1 h after the administration of the 20.0 mg/kg dose and continued until the last measurement was performed (8 h). In contrast, long-term diazepam administration did not modify the phlogistic-induced edema. Taken together, these data show that 1) acute diazepam treatment with high doses decreases the volume of the acute inflammatory paw edema developed by the organism as a response to carrageenin-induced injury, and 2) long-term diazepam treatment induces tolerance to this effect. These results are discussed in the light of a possible effect of diazepam on the components of the rat cellular and humoral immune/inflammatory reaction such as T lymphocytes and/or interleukins.",

    "74": "Emotional stress was caused in rats by changing the location of the gate in the shuttle chamber through which training had been accomplished in the previous experiments. The procedure led to disorder of the avoidance response (AR) and increase of intertrial responses (ITR). Phenazepam (0.1 mg/kg) prevented increase in the number of ITS. Piracetam (300 mg/kg) reduced the sharp growth of ISR but, in contrast to phenazepam, it provided a higher level of AR reproduction. The ISR were greater in piracetam than in phenazepam administration. The obtained results show that the suggested model allows the difference in the effects of piracetam and phenazepam to be disclosed.", 
    "75": "To clarify the demographic and clinicolaboratory features of postdialysis fatigue (PDF), we enrolled 85 patients on maintenance hemodialysis in a cross-sectional study using validated questionnaires and chart review. Forty-three patients complained of fatigue after dialysis. On formal testing using the Kidney Disease Questionnaire, the PDF group had statistically greater severity of fatigue and somatic complaints than the group of patients without subjective fatigue (P = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). On a scale measuring intensity of fatigue (1 = least to 5 = worst), the PDF group average was 3.4 +/- 1.2. PDF subjects reported that 80% +/- 25% of dialysis treatments were followed by fatigue symptoms. In 28 (65%) of patients, the symptoms started with the first dialysis treatment. They reported needing an average of 4.8 hours of rest or sleep to overcome the fatigue symptoms (range, 0 to 24 hours). There were no significant differences between patients with and without PDF in the following parameters: age; sex; type of renal disease; presence of diabetes mellitus, heart disease (congestive, ischemic), or chronic obstructive lung disease; blood pressure response to dialysis; type or adequacy of dialysis regimen; hematocrit; electrolytes; blood urea nitrogen; creatinine; cholesterol; albumin; parathyroid hormone; ejection fraction; and use of antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and narcotics. In the fatigue group, there was significantly greater use of antihypertensive medications known to have fatigue as a side effect (P = 0.007). Depression was more common in the fatigue group by Beck Depression score (11.6 +/- 8.0 v 7.8 +/- 6.3; P = 0.02). We conclude that (1) postdialysis fatigue is a common, often incapacitating symptom in patients on chronic extracorporeal dialysis; (2) no routinely measured parameter of clinical or dialytic function appears to predict postdialysis fatigue; and (3) depression is highly associated with postdialysis fatigue, but the cause-effect relationship is unclear.", 
    "76": "Alprazolam is one of the most commonly prescribed psychotropics drug all over the world. This suggests that alprazolam is very effective and safe. A multicentre clinical trial was carried out for assessing its efficacy and side effects. 130 patients suffering from anxiety disorders, mixed anxiety and depressive disorders and dysthtymia were involved in the trial. During 6 weeks they used to take from 1.5 to 2.5 mg. of alprazolam daily. Mental state has been assessed with Hamilton rating scales of anxiety and depression, Montgomery Asberg scale of depression and CGI scales. At the endpoint good recovery was found in 75% of the patients, mild recovery in 19%, and 6% got worse. The effect of treatment depends on individual patients' traits rather than on initial mental state. Adverse events were noted in a half of patients, were not severe and were going down during the treatment. 4.6% of patients dropped out because of adverse events, the others tolerated alprazolam well.", 
    "77": "Reported adverse reactions to orally administered sedative/hypnotics were systematically recorded during a 3-year period in a 1,000-bed teaching hospital. Reported cases were reviewed by a multidisciplinary committee and then by a pharmacist, and judgments were made as to type, severity, and outcome of adverse reactions. Probability that the reaction was caused by the medication was recorded in terms of both a global judgment and a systematic scale. The frequency of adverse reactions was calculated as a percentage of total doses of each agent dispensed by the pharmacy during the same time period. The assessment of benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotics indicated that adverse reactions were rare, ranging from frequencies of 0.05% of doses administered (lorazepam) to none (chlorazepate). The median frequency of reported adverse reactions was 0.01%, or 1 in 10,000 doses. The vast majority of reactions could be viewed as extensions of the therapeutic effect, were considered mild, and were without sequelae. All adverse reactions occurred in patients over 55 years old except for four patients under age 50 who received lorazepam. There were no reported cases of violent behavior or global amnesia.", 
    "78": "The relationship between reports of falling down and the administration of sedative/hypnotics or other psychotropic drugs was examined during a 1-year period in a 1,000-bed teaching hospital. It was found that patients who fell were approximately 2.7 times as likely to have received a psychotropic drug compared to control subjects matched for age, gender, and medical service. Orally administered benzodiazepines that were significantly associated with falls included temazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and lorazepam, but not triazolam, chlordiazepoxide, or chlorazepate. When viewed as the frequency of falls per dose dispensed by the pharmacy, the highest rates were with lorazepam (0.0012 falls/dose) and alprazolam (0.0010 falls/dose), whereas the lowest rate was for diazepam (0.00052 falls/dose). Falls with antidepressants were comparable to the higher rates with benzodiazepines; frequencies for nortriptyline and sertraline were 0.0021 and 0.0012 falls/dose, respectively. Patients receiving two or three psychotropic drugs concomitantly were 3.7 and 9.5 times, respectively, more likely to fall compared to control subjects. Patients under 21 years old who fell were also significantly more likely to have received a psychotropic medication compared to control subjects. Although these data are associational and do not necessarily imply causality, prudence indicates that the risk of falls be considered in making benefit/risk decisions about prescribing sedative/hypnotics.",

    "85": "The elderly frequently use psychoactive drugs including alcohol (ethanol), benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics, which have a propensity to cause abuse and dependence. Theoretically, the changes in pharmacokinetics of these agents in the elderly may modify their abuse and dependence potential. In the elderly, blood alcohol concentrations following an oral dose are higher, alcohol withdrawal syndrome follows a more severe and protracted clinical course and requires treatment with higher doses of chlordiazepoxide than needed for younger adults. However, there is no direct evidence that supports an increased direct abuse and dependence potential of alcohol because of its altered kinetics in the elderly. In the case of oxidatively metabolised benzodiazepine, both age-related pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic changes may increase their clinical effects in the elderly. The hypothesis that benzodiazepines have an increased abuse and dependence potential in the elderly has not been tested. Many of the benzodiazepines (e.g. alprazolam, triazolam and midazolam) are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A subfamily. The pharmacokinetics of these agents may be modified by inhibition of CYP3A due to concurrently administered medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Unfortunately, data on the direct measures of abuse and dependence potential of benzodiazepines are not available in the elderly. Thus, a conclusive statement on the contribution of age-related pharmacokinetic changes to benzodiazepine abuse and dependence cannot be made at the present time. The clinical effects of codeine do not appear to change with age. Codeine is O-demethylated to its active metabolite morphine by the genetically polymorphic CYP2D6 isozyme. The activity of this isozyme is unaltered by age, gender or smoking habits; however, it is subject to potent inhibition by some of the frequently used medications in the elderly, such as the antidepressants paroxetine and fluoxetine. This may result in an impairment in O-demethylation of codeine to morphine and may lead to a decrease in the abuse and dependence potential of codeine. Conversely, those with a very rapid CYP2D6 catalytic activity may have an increased potential for codeine abuse and dependence. The clinical significance of age-related pharmacokinetic changes should be evaluated within the context of clinical practice. Most physicians are inclined to prescribe lower doses to the elderly, which may offset the potential impact of altered pharmacokinetics on the abuse and dependence potential of psychoactive agents. In summary, the available data are not sufficient for a definitive conclusion on whether the pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly translate to an increase in the abuse and dependence potential of alcohol, benzodiazepines or opioids. In particular, the data on age-associated changes in direct measures of abuse potential of these agents are missing. Future comparative systemic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies assessing pertinent outcome measures on abuse and dependence potential of commonly used psychoactive drugs are required to resolve the ongoing controversy on risk factors for drug abuse and dependence in the elderly.", 
    "86": "Certain types of cancer pain fail to respond well either to systemic drug therapy or to spinal opioids because of the occurrence of intolerable adverse effects. In addition to spinal opioids other drugs may produce an antinociceptive effect when administered by the spinal route, such as local anesthetics, NSAID, alpha 2-agonists, calcium-channel blockers, NMDA antagonists, cholinergic drugs, peptides such as somatostatin, octreotide or calcitonin, adenosine agonists, benzodiazepines, neurokinin and cholecystokinin antagonists, nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and enkephalinase inhibitors. All these drugs may be administered in combination between them, realising the so called balanced spinal analgesia. The aim of this study is to analyse: the available methods for the evaluation of pharmacological interactions, the types of interaction between different spinal antinociceptive drugs and the role of balanced spinal analgesia in the treatment of cancer pain. Analysis of the presented data shows that the spinal synergism between opioids-local anesthetics and opioids-alpha 2-agonists can be useful in the treatment of opioid refractory cancer pain. Furthermore, the use of cholinergic drugs combined with opioids and alpha 2-agonists may be promising. Finally, even if the synergism between NSAID or NMDA antagonists with opioids or alpha 2-agonists have been proved, at the moment their use in man by the spinal route is not advisable because of the absence of adequate studies on their neurotoxicity and adverse effects.", 
    "87": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor has been the focus of considerable research effort over a decade. However, the definitive classification of this receptor and the full characterization of its pharmacology is still in progress. On the one hand, the selective serotonin-1A receptor partial agonist anxiolytics were developed first and represented a new class of pharmacological agents that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These compounds (e.g. buspirone, gepirone, tandospirone or ipsapirone) offered a completely different pharmacologic approach to this disorder from previous medications as benzodiazepines or alcohol. On the other hand, beta-adrenoceptor blockers (e.g. [-]-pindolol, [-]-propranolol) have been shown to have antagonistic properties on the 5-HT1A receptor side. Preliminary results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor blockers may be useful as adjunctive medication in the treatment of depression by augmenting the antidepressant efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. As the beta-adrenoceptor blockers show also affinities to other 5-HT receptors than the 5-HT1A receptor the recently discovered more selective 5-HT1A antagonists became of interest. The pharmacological properties and potential therapeutic utility of these novel compounds will also be discussed.", 
    "88": "Steroids which are synthesised de novo in the CNS are termed neurosteroids. In contrast to classical non-genomic steroid effects, neurosteroids interact with GABAa and NMDA receptors localized on the cell membrane. This mode of action implies an influence of neurosteroids on a variety of central nervous processes. More specifically, this compound class could act as an endogenous anxiolytic agent through modulation of the GABAa receptor complex, thereby presenting potential advantages over existing classes of anxiolytics, e.g. benzodiazepines, with regard to tolerance, dependence and abuse liability. The present paper reviews the current state of research in this field.",

The pups born were subjected to open-field exploratory behaviour, tunnel-board exploratory behaviour, elevated zero maze behaviour and social interaction tests at 8-9 weeks of age. The results indicate that prenatal diazepam treatment induces a significant increase in open-field ambulation, grooming, scratching and licking/washing, whereas rearing and faecal dropping remain unchanged. Significant reduction in tunnel-board exploratory activity, activity on zero-maze and social interaction were also observed in the prenatally diazepam treated offsprings. The results suggests that prenatal interference in the form of diazepam leaves a lasting imprint on offsprings resulting in hyper-emotional responsiveness and anxiety state.",

Patients with the following criteria were included: normal sexual function before SSRIs intake, exclusive treatment with SSRIs or associated with benzodiazepines, previous heterosexual or self-orone current sexual practices. We excluded patients with previous sexual dysfunction, association of SSRIs with neuroleptics, recently hormone intake and significant medical illnesses.",

Only 22.6% of the patients had a good tolerance about their sexual dysfunction. SD has positive correlation with the dose. The patients experienced substantial improvement in sexual function when the dose was diminished or the drug was withdrawn. Men showed more incidence of sexual dysfunction than women but women's sexual dysfunction was more intense than men.

Twenty-nine healthy two-to-four-year-old children participated in the study. Hydroxyzine was dripped nasally 10 minutes before treatment. The patient's crying, alertness, movement and general behavior were blindly assessed and statistically analyzed. No differences were found between the mean general behavior scores nor between the first and second visits in both groups. A significant difference (p < 0.02) was found in the acceptance of the face and nasal masks by children of the midazolam group between the first and second appointments. None of the children of this group cried nor moved at the first visit. The results of the study indicate that midazolam is somewhat more effective than hydroxyzine as a sedative agent for short procedures in young pediatric dental patients.",

For measurement of CBF with the Kety-Schmidt inert gas saturation technique, argon was used as indicator instead of nitrous oxide, because argon is less soluble in water and lipid such that arterial and hence organ saturation is attained earlier. Wash-in periods of 10 min were used for all measurements. For measurement of CBF with the intravenous xenon method 10 scintillation detectors placed lateral to the skull and an air detector for calculation of tracer recirculation were used. 10-15 mCi of 133Xe dissolved in physiological saline was injected via a peripheral i.v. cannula. For comparison with the Kety-Schmidt technique CBF15-values representing the flow of the grey and white matter were chosen. CBF was measured simultaneously with both methods under normocapnic (paCO2 43 +/- 3 mmHg), hypocapnic (paCO2 31 +/- 3 mmHg), and under hypercapnic (paCO2 54 +/- 4 mmHg) conditions.",

Hence, CMRO2 values calculated from CBF values obtained with the xenon method were reduced to about the same degree as those derived from CBF values measured with the Kety-Schmidt technique. There was no significant correlation between the CBF values of either method (y = 1.82x-8.58,r = 0.76 P = 0.357). Non-linear curve-fitting procedures yielded exponential CBF-paCO2 relationships for both methods, although the relative carbon dioxide reactivity was higher with the Kety-Schmidt technique than with the xenon method (y = 8.14 e0.039x vs y = 10,75 e0.023x).",

Results showed that alcohol-treated animals exhibited a delayed alternation deficit that was totally reversed by the administration of beta CCM administered before the retention trial only. 4. These findings show that the memory deficits observed in alcohol-treated animals are due to an impairment of the retrieval phase of memory processes, and that retrieval memory processes are sensitive to benzodiazepine receptor ligands.", 
    "99": "A problem of overprescribing of hypnotic medication ('sleeping tablets') was identified and quantified within a department of health care for older people in a district general hospital. Data on the volume of prescribing were obtained from computerized pharmacy records, and this information was supplemented by a retrospective survey of case notes of 100 patients. Sixty per cent of patients were prescribed a hypnotic at some stage during their hospital stay. Twelve per cent were prescribed a sleeping tablet on admission on an 'as required' basis but never took this medication, suggesting that such prescribing was becoming routine. As part of an ongoing pharmacy audit within the department, a policy was implemented to try to improve prescribing habits. Following this, hypnotic prescribing fell, with the average monthly number of sleeping tablets prescribed falling from 2392 to 734. A further survey of 100 case notes showed overall prescribing had fallen to 25%, although 2% were still prescribed a hypnotic on admission but never took it.", 
    "100": "Male and female animals of the SHA/Bru and SLA/Bru strains of rats were given extended two-way avoidance training in the shuttle box at the rate of 30 trials per day for 11 days. SLA/Bru animals increased their avoidance responses (AVRs) from approximately 10 to roughly 25%, whereas animals of the SHA/Bru strain remained unchanged at approximately 100% AVRs. SHA/Bru animals made a number of intertrial responses (ITRs) early in the experiment; these declined after about 3 days to the low level made by SLA/Bru animals. Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) had no effect on AVRs in animals of either strain, and had no effect on ITRs made by animals of the SHA/Bru strain, but increased ITRs, in a dose-dependent way, in animals of the SLA/Bru strain. These results are interpreted in terms of the well-established genetic difference in emotional reactivity between animals of the two strains and in terms of genetically determined differences in sensitivity to anxiolytic drugs such as CDP.",

ACTH response was significantly lower after flumazenil administration than after saline or midazolam. No significant treatment effect was found for the CRH-induced cortisol secretion.

    "102": "Animals or human subjects receiving brain stimulation in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG) show sudden fear-suggestive behavioral reactions and physical signs of autonomic activation which are reminiscent of the symptom profile characterizing a panic attack. An experimental situation in rats measuring dPAG stimulation self-interruption thresholds has been validated as realistically simulating several aspects of panic anxiety with objective signs of symptomatic and predictive validity using established antipanic and panicogenic agents; it was utilized here to evaluate the effects of various cholecystokinin B receptor ligands. A dose-dependent increase in self-interruption thresholds (antipanic-like effect) was recorded following injection of L-365,260 (3.2, 10 and 32 mg/kg i.p.), a CCKB receptor antagonist with good brain penetration, whereas no significant changes in thresholds were recorded following CI-988 (3.2, 10 and 32 mg/kg i.p.), a dipeptoid CCKB receptor antagonist with poor brain penetration. Latencies for self-interruption were not modified, suggesting that motor functions remained intact. No significant changes in self-interruption thresholds were recorded following peripheral administration of the CCKB receptor agonists CCK4 (0.03 to 0.32 mg/kg i.v.; 0.01 to 3.2 mg/kg i.p.) or the metabolically stabilized analog Boc-CCK4 (0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.p.). Systemic administration of the panicogenic compounds caffeine and yohimbine enhance acute anxiety in this model. These data indicate that, in the dPAG simulation of panic anxiety, central CCKB receptor blockade by L-365,260 induces antiaversive effects analogous to those observed following benzodiazepine receptor activation by clonazepam or alprazolam. Potency and efficacy of L-365,260 were lower than those of clonazepam or alprazolam, suggesting modest, but nonetheless authentic, antiaversive properties for this CCKB receptor antagonist. Lack of effects observed following peripheral administration of the agonists CCK4, and Boc-CCK4 or of the dipeptoid antagonist CI-988 is likely to reflect restricted brain penetration of those compounds in rats; it furthermore excludes a contribution of peripheral gastrin and CCKA receptors to the antipanic-like properties of selective CCKB receptor antagonists such as L-365,260.",

The benzodiazepines are detected with a diode array detector (DAD) at 240 nm and the peak purity analyses are performed at 210-365 nm. The recovery is over 97% for both analytes, and it is independent of the drug concentration. The intra-assay CVs vary between 0.7 and 2.2% and inter-assay CVs between 3.8 and 4.6% at therapeutic drug concentrations. The detection limit is 15 nmol l-1. The assay is linear from 30 to 20,000 nmol l-1 (clobazam) and from 170 to 105,000 nmol l-1 (norclobazam). This method leads to a very good separation of norclobazam from carbamazepine and phenytoin. None of the anti-epileptic or antidepressant drugs tested interfere with the assay.", 
    "104": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing marked pathology in the motoneuron system. The pathophysiology of the selective degeneration of motor neurons in the disease is as yet unknown, but evidence suggests that excitotoxic mechanisms might be involved. The present study was undertaken to determine whether defects in neurotransmitter receptors are involved in the disease, analyzing uniformly sampled specimens from neocortex and motorcortex. The binding to benzodiazepine, muscarinic cholinergic, and NMDA receptors in ALS brains was compared to that in control brains, using a single radioligand concentration of [3H]Ro 15-1788, [3H]QNB and [3H]MK-801. The benzodiazepine and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding was unaffected in any cortical region from the ALS subjects compared to controls. NMDA receptor binding labeled by [3H]MK-801 was significantly increased in several neocortical regions in the ALS group compared to the control group. Scatchard analysis of [3H]MK-801 binding in frontal cortex revealed a single binding site with an unaltered maximal binding capacity but an increased binding affinity of the site in the ALS group compared to the controls. The generalized alteration in the affinity of the binding site for [3H]MK-801 in the ALS cortex may indicate a modification of the NMDA receptor due to different sensitivity for endogenous modulators or to a different subunit composition of the NMDA receptor in ALS with altered functional properties. These findings may reflect a pathophysiological phenomenon in ALS.", 
    "105": "Assessment of treatment strategies in febrile seizures should be based on short- and long-term outcomes, with and without acute, intermittent, or chronic medical intervention, as well as short- and long-term side effects. Febrile seizures are a benign condition with a normal neurological, motor, intellectual, and cognitive long-term outcome and have a low risk of later epilepsy in most cases. Even many complex febrile seizures have a benign outcome. Prophylaxis may or may not reduce the recurrence rate, but does not appear to improve the long-term outcome as compared to acute treatment of seizures in progress. All agree that chronic prophylaxis with anti-epileptic agents is justified only in highly selected cases, if at all. Treatment with benzodiazepines during febrile episodes appears to effectively reduce the recurrence rate, provided adequate doses are given and compliance problems minimized. A selective approach to intermittent diazepam prophylaxis seems rational, as the recurrence risk and response to treatment are highly variable. An attractive alternative is acute treatment at seizure onset with rectal diazepam in solution given by the parents at home in order to prevent prolonged recurrent seizures. This regimen has the potential of moving the first line of anti-convulsant defence close to the child. It appears to be effective, inexpensive, feasible even for non-professionals, has few side effects and is well accepted by the parents. A reasonable policy would be to treat simple febrile seizures solely with acute rectal diazepam in solution and reserve intermittent diazepam prophylaxis for selected cases including those with multiple or prolonged recurrences, several risk factors for recurrent febrile seizures and other special situations.", 
    "106": "New advances in the knowledge on the physiopathogenesis of epilepsy and their relationship with sodium and calcium channels and with the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters actions have recently been developed. These knowledges have produced the research on new antiepileptic drugs which action places have specially based on the known impaired mechanisms. As the conventional drugs, the new therapeutic tool have produced a great advance in the therapy of epileptic events, specially in the refractory seizures, which represent 25-30% of the whole group of epilepsies. In the present work, we review the new drugs, ones have been registered, in order to their pharmacological properties, their efficacy their safety and their clinical indications as first-election or adjuvant drugs. We also discuss their known side adverse effects.", 
    "107": "We investigated the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment in clinic-based (n = 10) and community-based (n = 10) patients by studying the relationships between dose, plasma concentrations of methadone and non-prescribed drug-use using logistic regression. We found that clinic-based patients had significantly reduced odds of having a urine sample test positive for illicit drugs when compared to community-based patients (OR = 0.20; 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.38: p < 0.001). There was no relationship between either methadone dose or plasma methadone concentration and testing positive for non-prescribed drugs (including cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine, ecstasy, benzodiazepines). We looked specifically at the misuse of opiate drugs. Location was again important and clinic-based patients had significantly reduced odds of having a urine sample test positive for opiate drugs (OR = 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.71: p approximately 0.004). Opiate drug use in our patients was also significantly related to plasma methadone concentration, increasing noticeably when the drug concentration < 0.48 nmol/L (p approximately 0.04). We found no relationship between methadone dose and odds of having a positive urine drug test in either clinic- or community-based patients.", 
    "108": "Taijin-kyofu-sho (TKS) is thought to be a common, culture-bound disorder of social anxiety in Japan and Korea. Its phenomenology has been noted to overlap with that of social phobia. The \"offensive type\" of TKS, which has no direct parallel in Western classification, is characterized by a fear of offending others in social situations, which leads to social avoidance. There has been only one case of offensive-type TKS reported in the United States, and this case was not regarded as a variant of social phobia.", 
    "109": "The phenomenology and treatment of six patients who presented to New York City anxiety disorders research clinic psychiatrists with the offensive type of TKS are described. Features of TKS are compared with those of social phobia, as described in Western countries. Treatment outcomes for four patients are discussed and compared with TKS treatment experience in Japan and Korea and with treatment outcome in social phobia.", 
    "110": "In this anxiety clinic sample, features of the offensive type of TKS showed much overlap with symptoms of social phobia. Only two of four treated patients in this TKS sample received adequate trials of medication known to be effective for social phobia, and one of the two improved significantly.", 
    "111": "The offensive type of TKS may not be as culture-bound as previously thought. Further study is needed to determine whether such cases respond to medications and to cognitive-behavioral approaches that are effective for social phobia. How to classify the offensive type of TKS is uncertain, but social phobia should be considered in the differential diagnosis.", 
    "112": "Tetrazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative clinically used as a muscle relaxant. The aim of the present work was to examine its effect on uterine smooth muscle of the rat in estrus. Tetrazepam required micromolar concentrations to relax contractile responses induced by KCl and acetylcholine in Ca2+ solution, but not oxytocin-induced contraction. In Ca(2+)-free solution, tetrazepam inhibited Ca(2+)-induced contractions in depolarized uterus and vanadate-induced contractions. We suggest that tetrazepam relaxes contractile responses induced by activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and receptor-operated calcium channels with little selectivity or that it antagonizes the effect of calcium at subsequent steps, possibly intracellular stores sensitive to vanadate but not sensitive to oxytocin. The inhibition of contraction of rat uterus is not related to high-affinity peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "113": "Intrathecal midazolam for use as a post-operative analgesic when given alone and in conjunction with intrathecal diamorphine was assessed. Fifty-two patients scheduled for elective Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either bupivacaine (B), bupivacaine with diamorphine (BD), bupivacaine with midazolam (BM) or all three (BMD) by intrathecal injection. Post-operatively, no differences in visual analogue score (VAS), sedation or post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) could be demonstrated between groups. Patient-controlled analgesia system (PCAS) usage was significantly greater in group B when compared with the other groups. Pruritus was commoner in patients receiving diamorphine (BMD & BD). No side effects attributable to midazolam were identified. Intrathecal midazolam at this dose appears safe and has clinically detectable analgesic properties. The duration of useful analgesia appears to be short-lived."
