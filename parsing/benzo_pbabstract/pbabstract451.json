The experiments presented here show that the drug has a dose-dependent, slowly developing, long-lasting and reversible inhibitory action on the field potentials recorded from the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus, in vitro. Its action is similar to that of the well-known non-NMDA receptor blocker, CNQX. When the stimulus intensity-dependence of the population spikes was investigated, both drugs shifted the input-output curves in a parallel manner, while the maximum responses were only slightly depressed at the doses applied. With i.v. application, GYKI 52466 also inhibited the hippocampal field potentials recorded from the CA1 region of anesthetized rats dose-dependently. The inhibition was relatively weak compared to the effect found in earlier studies in the spinal cord, by the same doses. Four mg/kg i.v., a doses which is able to block spinal reflexes completely, caused an only about 20% depression of the recorded responses in the hippocampal CA1 area.", 
    "1": "The anxiolytic action of two 2,3-benzodiazepines: girisopam: GYKI 51,189 (EGIS 5810): (1-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-dimethoxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine), and GYKI 52,322 (EGIS 6775): (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-dimethoxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) was investigated in comparison to chlordiazepoxide and buspirone using three different animal models of anxiety: the lick conflict, the elevated plus maze and the open field methods in rats. Both 2,3-benzodiazepines exerted anxiolytic effect in all three tests used, however their pharmacological profile differs considerably from that of either chlordiazepoxide or buspirone. Using the animal models mentioned above the order of potency was GYKI 52,322 (EGIS 6775) > chlordiazepoxide > girisopam > buspirone.",

    "7": "Alcohol withdrawal is associated with a decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission. This explains the efficacy of benzodiazepines. However, an increase in adrenergic activity may also play a part in alcohol withdrawal symptoms, suggesting a potential efficacy of beta-blocking drugs. A double-blind comparative study of propranolol and diazepam was carried out in 28 patients suffering from moderate uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal. Patients were treated for 15 days with either 75 mg of propranolol or 30 mg of diazepam. The results show that both drugs at the dosages used are equipotent in reducing physical withdrawal symptoms and anxiety symptoms. This suggests that most likely the central as well as the peripheral effects determine the clinical usefulness of propranolol in the management of alcohol withdrawal. However, propranolol is ineffective in preventing major motor seizures, suggesting that different neurobiological mechanisms underlie the alcohol withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "8": "The effects of two recently developed gastrin receptor antagonists, PD 136450 and L-365,260, on pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion were investigated in rats. PD 136450 at a dose of 6 mg/kg s.c. (9.6 mumol) completely abolished acid secretion induced by pentagastrin. The inhibition of 18 mg/kg PD 136450 s.c. lasted for at least 8 h and was still effective after 14 days of treatment (18 mg/kg s.c. every 8 h). Acute application of L-365,260 at a dose of 3.8 mg/kg, which is equimolar (9.6 mumol) to 6 mg/kg PD 136450 reduced acid responses slightly. However, when L-365,260 was administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg, this antagonist completely abolished the pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. Furthermore, the effect of PD 136450 on endogenous gastric somatostatin and gastrin releases was tested in the isolated, vascularly perfused rat stomach. PD 136450 perfused at a concentration of 1 microM slightly increased somatostatin secretion after stimulation with a high dose of isoproterenol (10(-7) M). There was no effect of PD 136450 on basal or acetylcholine-stimulated gastrin secretion.",

The manifestations included loss of consciousness, focal sensorimotor deficits, diffuse dysesthaesiae, visual disorders and tremor. They lasted 10 to 45 minutes and occurred once per day to once per week. Organic pathology was dismissed on the basis of normal examinations and atypical course. In all patients questioning revealed symptoms that were those of acute anxiety. The fact that these attacks took place in suggestive (circumstances e.g. in crowds and car driving), and that they could be induced by challenge tests hyperpnoea, infusion of lactate) suggested that these disorders were consecutive to panic attacks.", 
    "10": "Suriclone is a new anxiolytic drug belonging to the family of cyclopyrrolones. The effects of acute and repeated doses of suriclone on subjective sleep, psychomotor performance and cognitive function were compared to those of placebo in young and elderly volunteers. Young volunteers randomly received suriclone 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg or placebo tid, and the elderly received suriclone 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg or placebo tid. After the first single dose and after a three-day treatment, subjects completed at 1, 2, 4, 12 and 24 h after drug administration the following battery of psychomotor and cognitive tests: critical flicker fusion threshold, choice reaction time, simulated car tracking test, the stroop test and the Sternberg memory scanning task. Visual analogue scales and the Leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire were also administered during the study. No significant effects of suriclone compared to placebo were seen on the psychomotor tests both in young and elderly volunteers. The only significant result was an improvement of the ease of getting to sleep in the young with 0.4 mg suriclone tid. In conclusion, there is little evidence to suggest that suriclone produces any measurable behavioural toxicity, so often seen with many of the benzodiazepines, in either young or elderly subjects.",

Phenazepam restores antibody formation in immunodeficiency induced by intoxication.

    "12": "The lateral tuberal nucleus is a circumscribed cell mass in the lateral posterior part of the hypothalamus, containing about 60000 neurons. It can be recognized in man and higher primates, probably not in other mammals. Its neurotransmitter content and connections with other parts of the brain are as yet unknown. But receptors for corticotropin-releasing factor and somatostatin, as well as muscarinic cholinergic receptors, benzodiazepine receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors have been localized within the confines of the nucleus. The lateral tuberal nucleus is affected in a number of human neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in Parkinson's disease are the least obvious: Lewy bodies appear in small amounts, the majority of them apparently lying outside a neuronal perikaryon. Neuronal loss does not occur. In Alzheimer's disease the number of neurons seems to be normal as well. Rarely silver staining tangles occur, and the deposition of A4/beta-protein in amorphous plaques is moderate. Yet, NTL neurons stain heavily in Alz-50 immunocytochemistry, while Alz-50 staining in NTL neurites is very dense. These changes are interpreted as indicating early Alzheimer-related pathology. In Huntington's disease the NTL loses neurons. This loss is related to the severity of the disease: patients who first display motor disturbances at an early age will lose more neurons than those who start later. The relation between these clinical characteristics and the severity of neuronal loss is such, that it seems likely that NTL neurons possess a special vulnerability for the effect of the Huntington gene. This could be related to their NMDA-receptor content. It is hypothesized that the NTL is involved in a neuronal network that regulates feeding and metabolism. NTL pathology may explain the peculiar catabolic state of many patients with Alzheimer's or Huntington's diseases.", 
    "13": "A significant minority of patients with schizophrenia fail to respond to neuroleptic medication alone. In some of these patients, adjunctive treatment with benzodiazepines may prove beneficial. Preclinical studies suggest that benzodiazepines significantly decrease brain dopamine release and turnover, perhaps by augmenting gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition of dopamine neuron activity. Double-blind clinical studies, however, have not conclusively established a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of schizophrenia, and it seems likely that some patients respond favorably, whereas others do not. We review preliminary new observations that approximately half of a group of treatment-resistant patients, studied in a double-blind treatment protocol, demonstrated clinically significant antipsychotic responses to adjunctive alprazolam. We also briefly describe long-term efficacy of alprazolam in several patients whom we have followed in open-label clinical settings. Possible predictors or biological concomitants of benzodiazepine responsivity, which may aid in delineating distinct subgroups of patients, are discussed, and recommendations for future research are presented.",

Eight patients with prolonged histories of abuse of cocaine, alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs were enrolled in this weekly group treatment at a community mental health center drug treatment program, while continuing in treatment with their current case manager or primary therapist. Six of the eight patients achieved periods of stable abstinence, documented by self-report, urine toxicology screens, continued group attendance, and improved social functioning.

    "15": "Behavioral and EEG effects of 2-(7-chloro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)-3-[(1,4)-dioxa-8-(azas piro-[4.5]dec-8- yl)carbonylmethyl]isoindolin-1-one (DN-2327; 1, 5 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) were compared to those of diazepam (0.2 and 1 mg/kg p.o.) and buspirone (1 and 5 mg/kg p.o.) in freely moving cats. DN-2327 did not affect motor coordination or the relative percentages of the three sleep-wakefulness stages. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) increased wakefulness and non-REM sleep, and buspirone (5 mg/kg) also increased wakefulness and decreased REM sleep. In addition, diazepam (1 mg/kg) caused severe motor disturbance, but buspirone did not. The cortical EEG power density spectra during wakefulness were changed almost dose-dependently by DN-2327 (decreased: 2-7.75 Hz; increased: 20-49.75 Hz), and dose-dependently by diazepam (decreased: 2-7.75 Hz; increased 13-49.75 Hz) and buspirone (decreased: 4-9.75 and 13-19.75 Hz). The effect of DN-2327 on the cortical EEG varied with the sleep-wakefulness stage. The power of the 4- to 7.75-Hz frequency (theta) band of the hippocampal EEG during wakefulness was decreased by diazepam and buspirone but not by DN-2327, while the peak frequency of its spectra was decreased only by diazepam. On the other hand, during non-REM sleep, DN-2327 decreased the power of the theta band as did diazepam. These results indicate that the behavioral and EEG effects of DN-2327 differ completely from those of buspirone and considerably from those of diazepam and that the EEG effect of DN-2327 varies with the sleep-wakefulness stage.", 
    "16": "The evaluation of sleep EEG patterns is mostly accomplished by visual analysis. With modern personal computers however, it is possible to perform signal detection within a reasonable length of time automatically. This paper presents a method for signal processing based on matched filtering. This allows the detection of sleep spindles and K-complexes in a sleep EEG recording with a high degree of accuracy. First the technique is described, and the results of a validation study based on the comparison of visual evaluations and computer analysis are presented. Thereafter, results of an application study are presented. Sleep spindle and K-complex density under the influence of lormetazepam and zopiclone were examined. Under both medications sleep spindle density increased while K-complex density decreased. Computation of Pearson's correlation coefficients demonstrated that the interindividual sleep spindle and K-complex variations under both treatments are highly correlated. The data suggest that lormetazepam and zopiclone, although chemically different, have a similar mode of action and display comparable effects on the sleep EEG.", 
    "17": "Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed in a random sample of a total of 195 men and 211 male alcoholic patients admitted for the first time during a period of two years from the same geographically limited area of Greater Stockholm as the sample. The same medical, social and neuroradiological methods were used for examination of the alcoholic inpatients as for the random controls. Laboratory tests were performed, including liver and pancreatic tests. Toxicological screening was performed and the consumption of hepatotoxic drugs was also investigated and the following were the types of drugs used: antiarrhythmics, antiepileptics, antiphlogistics, mixed analgesics, barbiturates, sulphonamides, benzodiazepines, clomethiazole and phenothiazine derivatives, all of which are metabolised by the liver. The group of male alcoholic inpatients and the random sample were then subdivided with respect to alcohol consumption and use of hepatotoxic drugs: Group IA, men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption and no use of hepatotoxic drugs; IB, men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption with use of hepatotoxic drugs; IIA, alcoholic inpatients with use of alcohol and no drugs; and IIB, alcoholic inpatients with use of alcohol and drugs. Group IIB was found to have a higher incidence of cortical and subcortical changes than group IA. Group IB had a higher incidence of subcortical changes than group IA, and they differed only in drug use. Groups IIB and IIA only differed in drug use, and IIB had a higher incidence of brain damage except for anterior horn index and wide cerebellar sulci indicating vermian atrophy. Significantly higher serum (S) levels of bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine amino-transferase (ALAT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and amylase were found in IIB. The results indicate that drug use influences the incidence of cortical and subcortical aberrations, except anterior horn index. It is concluded that the groups with alcohol abuse who used hepatotoxic drugs showed a picture of cortical changes (wide transport sulci and clear-cut or high-grade cortical changes) and also of subcortical aberrations, expressed as an increased widening of the third ventricle.", 
    "18": "The findings of this study extend the observations of Deutch et al. who suggested that NT in the ventral mesencephalon may be involved in the environmentally elicited activation of selectively responsive populations of mesotelencephalic dopamine neurons. The unconditioned response of NT-LI to electric footshock was observed only at an intensity of 500 microA and only in the lateral subdivision of the VTA. The selective effect of footshock stress on the NT content of a specific cell body group of the ventral mesencephalon suggests that NT mechanisms in the lateral VTA may, in part, underlie the stress-induced activation of dopamine neurons that originate in the lateral VTA. However, it should be noted that populations of dopamine neurons are activated by footshock intensities less than 500 microA, while NT concentrations of mesencephalic dopamine cell body groups are not altered by these shock intensities. The disparity weakens the possibility of a role for NT in the stress-induced activation of brain dopamine neurons unless NT mechanisms may be involved in transducing the effects of higher intensity stressors versus low intensity stressors. However, it should be noted that changes in the concentration of NT-LI represent an endpoint of unknown sensitivity and functional significance and best serve as an initial approximation of the effects of a manipulation on NT-containing neurons. It is plausible that NT mechanisms in the ventral mesencephalon may act in concert with other neuropeptides such as substance P and Met-enkephalin to transduce the effects of stressors on alterations in the activity of mesotelencephalic dopamine neurons that originate in the ventral mesencephalon. An examination of the effects of footshock stress on the content of prepro-NT mRNA in the dopamine cell body groups of the ventral mesencephalon would be of interest in assessing whether stress enhances NT gene expression or alters the characteristics of release of this neuropeptide in the ventral mesencephalon. Lacking NT receptor antagonists, it would also be of interest to determine the effects of the passive immunoneutralization of NT in the ventral mesencephalon on footshock-induced increases in the biochemically estimated activity of mesotelencephalic dopamine neurons to better understand the involvement of NT as a transducer of the effects of stress on dopamine neuronal activity. The distinct topography of conditioned versus unconditioned stress on the concentration of NT-LI in the dopamine cell body groups of the ventral mesencephalon suggests that NT may be involved in the differential activation of distinct dopamine neuronal populations by these different stressors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Studies of adenohypophyseal hormones, cortisol, T3, T4, thyroxine-binding globulin, testosterone, progesterone and estradiol in 90 neurotic men, treated or not with amitriptyline and benzodiazepines, allowed a conclusion that in the majority of them, endocrine functions were activated. 11 healthy men and 11 male patients underwent the three-day test with sinacten-depot (1 mg intramuscularly). The functional test data were compared over time by the methods of nonparametric statistics. The patients manifested a decrease of reserve potentialities of the pituitary-adrenal system, redistribution of the fractions of thyroid hormones, gonadotropins, the progesterone/estradiol ratio, a rise of prolactin and testosterone secretion. The drugs were found to improve the functioning of the pituitary-adrenal system. However, they did not contribute much to the positive changes in the pituitary-thyroid and other systems.", 
    "20": "To potentiate the psycho- and autonomic activity of phenazepam and to decrease its side effects, cranio-cervical electrophoresis of the drug is suggested. The method is realized with the aid of a special electrode helmet which permits localizing electrodes in the frontal and occipital areas and at different levels of the lateral surfaces of the neck. Phenazepam in the amount of 1 ml of 3% solution was administered from the cathode. 194 patients with the psychovegetative syndrome in the clinical structure of neurosis or neurosis-like condition were treated. The dynamics of the psycho-vegetative status was verified with the aid of psychometric and vegetative techniques. Cerebral hemodynamics was investigated by rheoencephalography. The data obtained demonstrate that the treatment suggested improves the patients' functional status, decreases reactive anxiety, raises the tempo of sensomotor reactions and attention activity, ameliorates short-term memory, exerts a sympatholytic action, and makes cerebral hemodynamics return to normal. The method produces fewer side effects as compared to the enteral intake of phenazepam.", 
    "21": "The aim of this review is to summarize the effects of acute and chronic treatment with barbiturates, ethanol and benzodiazepines on cholinergic mechanisms in the brains of experimental animals. A single dose of each of these substances reduces the turnover of ACh in the brain. Long-term treatment has the opposite effect; complicated interactions including decreased content of ACh are induced. Barbiturates have been shown to bind stereospecifically to muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the brain, but this has not been observed for ethanol or the benzodiazepines. The effects on the cholinergic system are affected by the length of treatment and choice of treatment regimen. No effect on cholinergic parameters, such as muscarinic receptors, in the brain is observed on withdrawal of ethanol or barbiturate treatment when the animals are still tolerant towards the substances. The increase in the number of muscarinic receptors observed in several brain regions on withdrawal is seen as a sign of cholinergic supersensitivity. The number of receptors returns to normal when abstinence convulsions have occurred. The assumption of a cholinergic influence is supported by the finding that atropine, given as a single dose on the day of withdrawal of barbital, can prevent the muscarinic receptor changes. Furthermore, long-term barbital or ethanol treatment can induce permanent persistent changes in the cholinergic system in the brain. Cognitive defects and a significant permanent reduction in the content of ACh can be measured in rats which have had long-term barbital treatment. Similarly, a reduced number of muscarinic receptors has been measured in different brain regions of chronic alcoholics. Accumulating data support the role of the cholinergic system in expressing symptoms of physical dependence on barbiturates, ethanol and benzodiazepines as well as in the permanent long-term effects observed after end of treatment.", 
    "22": "The treatment and management of neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenic patients, who comprise 5 to 25 percent of all patients with that diagnosis, are major problems for psychiatry. In addition, another large group of schizophrenic patients, perhaps 5 to 20 percent, are intolerant of therapeutic dosages of neuroleptic drugs because of extrapyramidal symptoms, including akathisia, parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Because about 60 percent of neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenic patients respond to clozapine and a large percentage of neuroleptic-intolerant patients are able to tolerate clozapine, it should be considered the treatment of choice for such patients until other therapies are proven to be superior. A trial of clozapine alone should usually be continued for up to 6 months before it is terminated or supplemental agents are tried. Plasma levels of clozapine may be useful to guide dosage. The major side effects of clozapine are granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis (1%-2%) and a dose-related increase in the incidence of generalized seizures. Psychosocial treatments such as education of the patient and the family about the nature of the illness, rehabilitation programs, social skills training, and assistance in housing are generally needed to obtain optimal benefit from clozapine, as with other somatic therapies. If clozapine is unavailable, unacceptable, or not tolerated, a variety of approaches may be employed to supplement typical antipsychotic drugs for patients who do not respond adequately to these agents alone. These include lithium; electroconvulsive therapy; carbamazepine or valproic acid; benzodiazepines; antidepressant drugs; reserpine; L-dopa and amphetamine; opioid drugs; calcium channel blockers; and miscellaneous other pharmacologic approaches. The evidence for the efficacy of these ancillary somatic therapies in treatment-resistant patients is relatively weak. Polypharmacy should be tried only for discrete periods and with clear goals. If these are not achieved, supplemental medications should be discontinued. Psychosurgery is not a recommended alternative at this time.", 
    "23": "Central dopaminergic transmission has been implicated in memory processes. The present experiments examined the effects of several direct acting dopaminergic agents on performance of a delayed-non-match-to-sample radial arm maze task. Preadministration of apomorphine (D1-D2 agonist; 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg), quinpirole (D2 agonist; 0.1 mg/kg), or SKF38393 (D1 agonist; 3 mg/kg) increased the latency of choices but did not affect any index of accuracy with a 1 h retention interval. Post-training administration of quinpirole (0.1, 0.2, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg), SKF38393 (0.3, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg), sulpiride (D2 antagonist; 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg), or SCH23390 (D1 antagonist; 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg) also did not affect accuracy, although quinpirole produced a dose-dependent increase in the latency of choices, assessed 10 h post-treatment. For comparison, pretraining and post-training administration of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (1, 3, 5 mg/kg) was also tested and produced dose-dependent impairments in mnemonic performance at either a 1 or 4 h retention interval. The effects of chlordiazepoxide are consistent with evidence indicating that GABAergic agents can influence memory processes. In contrast, the present findings indicate that (peripheral administration of dopaminergic agents IS) not sufficient to alter the mnemonic processes required for accurate performance of this DNMTS-RAM task.", 
    "24": "The anxiolytic profile of dexmedetomidine, a novel, highly-selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, was examined in rats in the elevated plus-maze test when administered either alone or in combination with the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam. Dexmedetomidine, 0.1-10 micrograms/kg, was inactive in modifying the rats' behavioral response in this test. Midazolam, 0.1-10 mg/kg, dose-dependently produced an anxiolytic-like profile characterized by an increased time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. A combination of dexmedetomidine 0.5 micrograms/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg produced a synergistic interaction. This heterergic interaction of dexmedetomidine on midazolam's anxiolytic-like profile was dose-dependently blocked by pretreatment with an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, atipamezole, 10-50 micrograms/kg, and a benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, 1.0 and 10 mg/kg, but not by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, 0.1-10 mg/kg. While the transmembrane signal transduction pathways for benzodiazepine- and alpha 2-agonist responses do not share any molecular component, there does appear to be \"crosstalk\" between these two systems. These may involve GABA or noradrenergic \"downstream\" effects of either dexmedetomidine or midazolam, respectively.", 
    "25": "Many studies of brain glucose utilization by positron emission tomography attempt to describe the modifications of the brain activity during psychiatric diseases. A major difficulty in such studies is the necessity to assess patients free of pharmacological treatment, in order to relate the measured changes in glucose utilization to the pathopsychology, and not to a drug effect. In this paper are reviewed the arguments from the literature allowing to estimate the drug washout time for considering the patients as drug-free. The review is focussed on the known effects of the psychotrops on brain glucose utilization. This time is approximately six months for the neuroleptics given orally, one month for antidepressants, and five and a half half-lives for benzodiazepines. Alternative research strategies for avoiding a long drug washout are mentioned, and ethical limitations are considered.", 
    "26": "For many patients, dental procedures can cause a great deal of anxiety and fear. These emotions are part of a stress reaction, which, in physiologic terms, can pose a serious risk, particularly to patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disorders. In each case the dentist must decide whether anxiolytic stress-reducing treatment is indicated, and which method should be used. Besides certain psychotherapeutic techniques, numerous drugs (neuroleptics, barbiturates, beta-blockers, and benzodiazepines) are available for this purpose. This paper reviews these types of drugs and offers recommendations for their use.", 
    "27": "Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a novel tranquilizing agent--gidazepam (I), a prodrug, and its physiologically active metabolite--7-bromo-5-phenyl-1,2-di-hydro-3H-1,4- benzodiazepine-2-one (II) in mice organism were studied. The form of relationship was determined between the dynamics of the anticonvulsant effect of labelled (2-14C-) I and II and the kinetics of the content of 14C-compounds in the experimental animals brain. It was noted that the biophase of the effect and the effector fragment of the scheme of biokinetics for I and II are identical. The effector prognosis of pharmacokinetics of I was realized. The comparison of the main characteristics of biokinetics for the prodrug (I) and drug (II) allowed us to reveal the nature of the quantitative differences of these pharmacological effects.", 
    "28": "At present the dominant position among anti-anxiety medications has changed from meprobamate to the benzodiazepine derivatives. In order to avoid benzodiazepine's (BZ) undesirable side effects such as impairment of psycho-motor function, memory impairment, low dose dependence and withdrawal symptoms, a third generation anxiolytic agent, buspirone, the focus of the aryl-piperazine group of anti-anxiety agents, has been introduced recently. Aryl-piperazine derivatives work as 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists and are known as serotonin normalizers. Therefore, they are expected to have not only an anxiolytic function but also an anti-depressant effect as well. A characteristic of the aryl-piperazine derivatives is that they have no sedative and muscle relaxant effects, and they do not have BZ's undesirable side-effects, especially in regard to withdrawal symptoms. However they have a rather weak anxiolytic action and a slow onset of action. Aryl-piperazine derivatives will not take the place of BZ, but the use of BZ and buspirone as bridge medications, making the most of the strong points of both, can be proposed as a way to compensate for their respective clisadvantages.", 
    "29": "The discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment in patients with panic disorder may be associated with emergent withdrawal and anxiety symptoms, relapse of panic, and the inability to complete benzodiazepine taper. Although some patients may respond to slow taper strategies or the use of pharmacologic adjuncts, many continue to experience significant difficulties during benzodiazepine discontinuation. This paper presents a cognitive-behavioral conceptualization of benzodiazepine discontinuation difficulties, emphasizing \"fear of fear\" cycles. From this perspective the discontinuation process is seen as exposing panic disorder patients to somatic sensations associated with panic at a time when there is both increased anxiety and concern about re-emergence or worsening of panic episodes. As a consequence, patients may re-enter a cycle of catastrophic interpretations of symptoms, increased vigilance and fear, and panic. Cognitive-behavioral interventions may ameliorate discontinuation-associated difficulties and prevent the return of the panic disorder. Preliminary data supporting the efficacy of these interventions are described.", 
    "30": "The evidence presented above indicates that GABA- and glutamate-activated ion channels are molecular sites of alcohol and anesthetic action. In view of the important role that these channels play in CNS excitability, it seems likely that the actions of alcohol and anesthetics on these channels contribute significantly to the behavioral effects of these agents. Although the behavioral effects of alcohol and anesthetics may well result from a combination of actions on different ion channels and other molecular sites in the CNS, it is of interest to consider whether the actions of these agents on particular types of ion channels may contribute to particular behavioral effects. In this regard, it should be noted that benzodiazepines potentiate GABAA responses, but do not produce intoxication or general anesthesia in their clinical dose range. Benzodiazepines are widely used clinically, primarily for their anxiolytic actions (26), suggesting that the potentiation of GABAA responses by ethanol and barbiturates may contribute to the anxiolytic effects of these agents. Since kainate and quisqualate channels mediate fast excitatory transmission in the CNS, inhibition of kainate and quisqualate receptor-activated responses would be expected to result in general CNS depression. This suggests that inhibition of kainate and quisqualate receptor-mediated responses may contribute to the general anesthetic effects of ethanol, trichloroethanol and barbiturates. NMDA channels are thought to mediate complex excitatory neural phenomena and cognitive function. In view of this, the observation that ethanol inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated responses over the concentration range that produces intoxication and the correlation between the potency of different alcohols for inhibiting NMDA-activated current and their potency for producing intoxication suggest that ethanol-induced inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated responses may contribute to the intoxicating effects of ethanol. Although these speculations are no doubt oversimplifications, the recognition that GABA- and glutamate-gated ion channels are molecular sites of alcohol and anesthetic action provides a basis for investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the action of these agents and the behavioral significance of those actions.", 
    "31": "Previously, we reported potent inhibition of triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) cellular uptake into a human liver cell line (HepG2) by central and peripheral receptor specific benzodiazepine (BZ) compounds and our working hypothesis of BZ's as direct competitors for the iodothyronine transporter, displacing T3 but not acting as a substrate for transport. In this report, we list other reported uptake inhibitors and compare them to 23 benzodiazepine receptor ligands, in their potency to inhibit cellular uptake of T3. The most potent inhibitors are restricted to the benzodiazepine class. From the BZ structure-activity relationship (SAR) for inhibition, we see that the nonfused phenyl ring may be essential for activity and the strongest relationship is seen with substitution at R2' where Cl greater than F greater than H. Substitution at R4' and hydroxyl substitution at R3 enhances potency as will alkyl groups at R1 or on the imidazole group in the 1,2-annelated series. With R7 substitution, Cl is preferred over NO2 but not necessarily H when R4' = Cl; this may reflect a slightly different orientation of the molecule with large aliphatic R1 groups and/or R4' substitution. The carbonyl at R2 in the 1,4 benzodiazepine series, enhances their potency. The resultant structure-activity relationship highlights the importance of the halogen-substituted nonfused phenyl ring and seems unique relative to other described benzodiazepine sites and/or effects.", 
    "32": "Several model systems have been used to test the hypothesis that the release of FFA in the brain is regulated by depolarization of neurons. This FFA release is likely the result of the activation of phospholipase A2. The increased neuronal activity that occurs due to synchronous depolarization during seizures causes activation of phospholipase A2. Decreasing neuronal activity by administering the anxiolytic, diazepam, appears to decrease the activity of phospholipase A2. The GABA antagonist, bicuculline, which causes depolarization by negating the hyperpolarizing tone imposed on neurons by GABA, causes FFA release in synaptosomes and in neurons in tissue culture. Likewise, the glutamate agonist, kainic acid, which depolarizes neurons by opening sodium channels, increases the activity of phospholipase A2. PC-specific phospholipase C, another enzyme important in the generation of the second messenger, DG, is also activated by depolarization. Several important questions remain to be answered. The site of FFA release, in terms of the pre-vs. postsynaptic membrane, is not clear, although the experiments with synaptosomes support the hypothesis that activation of phospholipase A2 may be an important regulator of presynaptic events. This idea has also been suggested by studies on the phenomenon of long-term potentiation, where free 20:4 or its metabolites may be involved in presynaptic facilitation of neurotransmitter release (Freeman et al., 1990; Massicotte et al., 1990; Williams et al., 1989; also see Dorman, this volume). The activation of the PI cycle and subsequent stimulation of protein kinase C may be a postsynaptic event important in the integration of inputs at the dendrite and soma or a presynaptic event involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release (Taniyama et al., 1990; El-Fakahany et al., 1990; also see Nishizuka, this volume). Therefore the stimulation of a PC-specific phospholipase C, which is capable of generating large amounts of DG over a prolonged period of time (Exton, 1990; Martinson et al., 1990; Diaz-Laviada et al., 1990), could occur at either site. Another important question is the role of FFA and DG in affecting cell-cell signaling events, particularly with regard to ion fluxes. Modulation of an acetylcholine-linked K+ channel in the heart by FFA and their oxygenation products has been reported (Kim and Clapham, 1989). The cardiac muscarinic receptor is linked to a hyperpolarizing K+ channel via a G protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that the centrally-acting alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine can offer significant protection against both the acute and chronic toxicity following irreversible cholinesterase inactivation with soman. The purpose of this study was to estimate the contribution of central mechanisms to soman toxicity in a rat model; and to determine the effectiveness of clonidine and a series of related agonists to offer protection against the acute and chronic manifestations of this toxicity. To investigate the central component of soman toxicity, animals were pretreated with the peripherally selective reversible cholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine, a standard protective agent. Pyridostigmine pretreatment resulted in significant improvement in survival following soman administration. However, pyridostigmine was not able to inhibit the signs of central soman toxicity, including convulsive behavior. Clonidine and several related drugs produced both a further reduction in lethality and a significant reduction in the central signs of soman toxicity. Signs of delayed toxicity to soman were apparent in rats surviving 48 h after administration as measured in open-field locomotor monitoring. Again, pyridostigmine did not offer protection against such delayed toxicity. When clonidine was included in the regimen, however, significant improvement in performance in this measure was observed. These results are consistent with our earlier findings of significant protection provided by clonidine and related drugs against acute and chronic manifestations of soman toxicity and provide further evidence that 1) central toxicity is an important contributor to soman's actions, and 2) stimulation of central alpha 2-adrenergic receptors limits the expression of this central toxicity.",

    "35": "Atipamezole is a new specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. In this study, first, the presence of specific 3H-atipamezole binding sites in the sagittal and coronal sections of mouse brain was established using autoradiography. In vitro experiments with mouse cerebral cortex membranes indicated that d-medetomidine, a new alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist structurally related to atipamezole, displaces labelled atipamezole more potently than noradrenaline. The saturation isotherm with d-medetomidine demonstrated high affinity binding with the apparent number of binding sites KD 1.36 nM and 760 fmol/mg, respectively. In the next series of experiments male mice were sacrificed immediately after copulation and cerebral cortex 3H-atipamezole and 3H-flumazenil binding was studied. Oxymetazoline and prazosin are known to label preferably alpha 2A and alpha 2B subtypes of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Therefore, parallelly with noradrenaline both these compounds were used to determine non-specific binding of 3H-atipamezole. When noradrenaline or oxymetazoline were used as displacing agents copulation caused a significant increase of 3H-atipamezole binding sites. No significant changes were observed when prazosin was used. 3H-Flumazenil binding remained unchanged by copulation. The up-regulation of 3H-atipamezole binding sites indicates that not only alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the periphery but also in the CNS may participate in the regulation of sexual behavior. Moreover, in regulation of sexual behavior central alpha 2-adrenoceptors may be more important than benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "36": "The binding of nine diazepines to human serum albumin (HSA) and to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was investigated by means of fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. The binding parameters of diazepam obtained from fluorescence agreed with those obtained from CD measurements. Diazepines have one tight binding site on both HSA and AGP. The binding parameters (nK) of the diazepine: HSA systems are slightly higher than those of diazepine:AGP systems. The relationship between the binding parameters for these two serum proteins and the physicochemical parameters of diazepines was studied by multiple regression analysis to elucidate the binding mode. Moreover, the effects of long-chain fatty acids and cesium chloride on the binding of diazepines to HSA and AGP were also studied. The driving force for the binding of diazepines to both proteins appears to be hydrophobic interaction. In addition, steric effects and electrostatic interactions may also contribute to the binding of diazepines to HSA and AGP, respectively.", 
    "37": "The aim of this study was to use the elevated X-maze to compare acute and chronic treatments of a 5-HT1A partial agonist, ipsapirone, a 5-HT2 antagonist, ritanserin, and a 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron, with those of established anxiolytic (diazepam) and anxiogenic (idazoxan) compounds. Acute diazepam (5 mg/kg IP) produced a significant increase in the percentage open:total entries and time and time spent in the end of the open arms (anxiolytic profile) on the elevated X-maze. Chronic treatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg IP twice daily for 14 days) still produced an anxiolytic profile which was not apparent 24 h after cessation of chronic treatment (withdrawal). In contrast, idazoxan given both acutely (0.25 mg/kg IP) and chronically (0.8 mg/kg/h at a flow rate of 5.5 microliters/h for 14 days, via osmotic minipumps) resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage open:total entries and time and time spent in the end of the open arms (anxiogenic profile). Acute administration of ipsapirone had no effect on any of the behavioural parameters at doses of 0.01 and 1 mg/kg IP, while 0.1 mg/kg IP produced a significant anxiogenic profile. Chronic treatment with ipsapirone (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg IP twice daily for 14 days) had no significant effect on rat behaviour on the X-maze but 24 h after ending treatment, ipsapirone at the highest dose used (1 mg/kg) produced a significant anxiogenic profile which was absent when the animals were tested 7 days after cessation of treatment. Ritanserin (0.05 and 0.25 mg/kg IP) had no effect acutely on any of the parameters measured but chronic treatment (0.25 mg/kg IP, twice daily for 14 days) produced a significant anxiolytic effect which was still present 24 h but not 7 days after cessation of treatment. Acute ondansetron (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg IP) had no effect while chronic ondansetron (0.01 mg/kg IP, twice daily for 14 days) produced a significant anxiolytic profile which was not a result of handling during the chronic dosing schedule, an effect was not measureable 24 h after treatment ended. The results demonstrate that the X-maze can detect anxiolytic activity in non-benzodiazepine drugs, as ritanserin and ondansetron showed anxiolytic profiles but only after chronic treatment. In contrast, the X-maze failed to detect any anxiolytic activity with the 5-HT1A partial agonist ipsapirone after either acute or chronic treatment.", 
    "38": "The effects of a range of 5-HT receptor antagonists were examined in an animal model of anxiety--the social interaction test. Six antagonists with high affinity for 5-HT1C receptors; mianserin, (+) mianserin, 1-naphthyl piperazine, ICI 169 369, pizotifen and LY 53857 all increased the time spent in active social interaction by pairs of weight-matched rats under high light unfamiliar conditions. As locomotion was only increased by 1-NP and then only at high doses, the effect of the drugs is consistent with anxiolysis. These properties were shared by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide but not by the specific 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin and altanserin, nor by the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B antagonists cyanopindolol and pindolol. Similarly, neither the adrenergic alpha 2 antagonist idazoxan, the alpha 2 antagonist and putative 5-HT1D partial agonist yohimbine nor the H1 antagonist mepyramine had any significant effect. Since (+)mianserin, LY 53857 and ICI 169 369 at least have low affinity for 5-HT3 receptors these receptors are also unlikely to be involved. The results therefore imply that the observed anxiolytic effects of the drugs are likely to be mediated by 5-HT1C receptor blockade.", 
    "39": "The sedative, anxiolytic, and amnesic effects of diazepam were compared to those of CL 218,872, a triazolopyridazine that has a preferential affinity for the benzodiazepine omega 1 receptor subtype. Spontaneous locomotion was assessed using a running wheel, anxiety was assessed using an open-field divided into central and peripheral areas (thigmotaxis), and amnesia was assessed using the Morris water maze. It was found that CL 218,872, like diazepam, depressed spontaneous locomotion, reduced anxiety, and impaired place learning in a dose-dependent manner. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist with a similar affinity for both omega 1 and omega 2 subtypes, reversed all of the effects of diazepam and antagonized the anxiolytic and amnesic effects, and some but not all of the sedative effects of CL 218,872. These results suggest that the selective activation of the omega 1 receptor subtype by CL 218,872 is sufficient to produce sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia in a manner similar to that produced by the coactivation of both the omega 1 and omega 2 receptor subtypes with diazepam.",

The animals were confronted with a free exploratory test especially adapted to reveal behavioural sedation, and with a two-box light/dark choice situation validated for the detection of anti-anxiety agents. These drugs were found to have anxiolytic properties at low doses, like benzodiazepines. Furthermore, the drugs exhibited sedative effects at higher doses. These results closely resemble those we found after administration of two other 5-HT1A agonists, 8-OH-DPAT and MDL 73005EF (NeuroReport, 1, 267-270, 1990).",

It is suggested that knowledge of being at risk might be a factor reducing the consumption of benzodiazepines.", 
    "42": "The effects of diazepam (5 mg t.i.d.), suriclone (0.2 and 0.4 mg t.i.d.) and placebo (t.i.d.) were assessed in 12 normal, healthy volunteer subjects after a single dose and after treatment for a period of 8 days. A battery of physiological, psychomotor and subjective tests was administered on days 1 and 8 both before and after drug and after a measured dose of ethanol. The effects of diazepam on the EEG were characteristic of benzodiazepines-a decrease in the slow frequency wave-bands, an increase in fast frequency wave-band and diminished evoked response amplitude. Suriclone had similar effects on fast frequency activity and evoked response amplitude but, in contrast to diazepam, also increased the slow frequency wave-bands after 7 days treatment. Some improvements in performance were seen with suriclone on critical flicker fusion, tapping speed, spiral maze and digit cancellation. In contrast, suriclone impaired performance to a greater extent than diazepam on digit symbol substitution and symbol copying. Body sway was also enhanced by suriclone to a greater extent than diazepam. Subjective ratings for mood and adverse-effects showed few differences between suriclone or diazepam. However, suriclone caused greater gastro-intestinal disturbances than diazepam, especially after ethanol, and subjects rated themselves as more antagonistic and more irritable on suriclone. Ratings for calmness suggested that in contrast to diazepam, suriclone had no anxiolytic effect. Several of the parameters tested showed a build up of effect with diazepam over the treatment period which was not seen with suriclone. It is suggested that this difference may be due to differences in elimination rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We describe the identification of 7-chloro-1-methyl-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4-dione (clobazam) bound to the serum orosomucoid from individuals actively taking this tranquillizer. This suggests not only that other endogenous factors limit access to the benzodiazepine binding site on human serum albumin, but also that the differential binding of benzodiazepines and their metabolites by orosomucoid should be considered in determining therapeutic doses, particularly in the acute phase response.",

The discontinuation of twice daily administration of diazepam (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) induced withdrawal anxiogenesis and a proconvulsant effect. In contrast, no such effects were seen following withdrawal from similar administration of CI-988. However, CI-988 dose-dependently (0.001-1.0 mg kg-1, s.c.) antagonized both the anxiogenesis and the proconvulsant effect following diazepam-withdrawal.", 
    "45": "1. The relevance of EEG effect parameters as a measure of the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepines was evaluated. The concentration-EEG effect relationships of the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam, partial agonist bretazenil, antagonist flumazenil and inverse agonist Ro 19-4603 were quantified and compared with the intrinsic efficacy and affinity of these compounds at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. 2. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the compounds were determined after a single intravenous bolus administration of 5 mg kg-1 midazolam, 2.5 mg kg-1 bretazenil, 10 mg kg-1 flumazenil or 2.5 mg kg-1 Ro 19-4603 to male Wistar derived rats. In a separate experiment the distribution between blood, cerebrospinal fluid and brain concentrations of these compounds was determined. A sensitive assay was developed to measure bretazenil and Ro 19-4603 concentrations in small samples of biological fluids. 3. The benzodiazepine-induced changes in amplitudes in the 11.5-30 Hz frequency band, as determined by aperiodic analysis, was used as EEG effect measure. Concentration-EEG effect relationships were derived by a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling procedure and in the case of midazolam, bretazenil and Ro 19-4603 successfully quantified by the sigmoidal Emax model. Large differences in maximal effect of midazolam (Emax = 73 +/- 2 microVs-1), bretazenil (Emax = 19 +/- 1 microVs-1) and Ro 19-4603 (Emax = -6.5 +/- 0.4 microVs-1) were observed, reflecting their differences in intrinsic efficacy. A close correlation was found between the EC50 values based on free drug concentration and receptor affinity as determined by displacement of [3H]-flumazenil in a washed brain homogenate at 37 degrees C. In the concentration range of receptor saturation flumazenil did not produce any changes in the EEG effect measure.4. The study demonstrated that the change in amplitudes in the 11.5-30 Hz frequency band of the EEG is a relevant measure of the pharmacological effect intensity of benzodiazepines, because it seems to reflect their affinity and intrinsic efficacy at the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "46": "Buspirone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and ethanol all reliably reduce the frequency of reticular-elicited hippocampal rhythmical slow activity. In the present experiments we tested a number of drugs which are not usually used for treating generalized anxiety disorders but which have been reported to have some anxiolytic properties. Clonidine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), baclofen (6 mg/kg, i.p.) and 8-hydroxy-di-n-propylamino tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) all reduced the frequency of rhythmical slow activity. The effect of all three drugs was reduced by the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a antagonist pindolol (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Pindolol had no effect on the reduction in rhythmical slow activity produced by sodium amylobarbitone, as has been previously reported for the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide. Flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, reduced the effects of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, i.p.), but not buspirone (10 mg/kg, i.p.). A combination of the selective beta 1 adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and the beta 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) did not reduce the effects of either buspirone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). These data show that there are at least two separate routes through which anxiolytic agents reduce the frequency of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity. Buspirone, clonidine, baclofen and 8-OH-DPAT act via a system dependent on 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a receptor activation. Benzodiazepines act via activation of the benzodiazepine receptor and probably share with barbiturates action at the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ionophore complex but do not produce their effects, directly or indirectly, by 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a receptor activation.", 
    "47": "The effect of three anxiolytic drugs, indorenate, ipsapirone and diazepam, on the burying behaviour of rats and mice was studied. All three drugs induced a reduction in burying behaviour interpreted as a reduction in anxiety. However, a species difference in the diazepam sensitivity was found: rats showed a clear effect after 1.0 mg/kg while already at 0.25 mg/kg an action was observed in mice. The serotonergic anxiolytics produced similar responses at similar doses (2.5-5.0 mg/kg) in both species. The serotonergic antagonists, pindolol (3.1 mg/kg), alprenolol (5.0 mg/kg) and methiotepin (0.31 mg/kg), induced a slight reduction in the time spent burying but effectively counteracted the anxiolytic action of the serotonergic agonists in mice but not in rats. By contrast, in rats, the beta blocker, practolol (0.5 mg/kg), was the only drug effective in preventing the anxiolytic actions of ipsapirone. The combined treatment of indorenate and methiotepin resulted in an impairment of motor coordination and ambulatory behaviour in both species studied, thereby suggesting that the lack of effect of such combination was mediated by altering the motor behaviour. Finally, the reduction in ambulatory behaviour in mice produced by ipsapirone was effectively prevented by the antagonists methiotepin, pindolol and alprenolol indicating the involvement of a serotonergic receptor in this effect. From these results it is concluded that a different mechanism underlies the anxiolytic actions of indorenate and ipsapirone in mice and rats.", 
    "48": "In experiments on rats the presence or absence was studied of the phenomenon of potentiation of anxiolytic action, estimated by the time of the animal stay in the light part of the chamber in tests of avoidance of \"the lighted ground\" or \"menacing situation\" at combined application of the pairs of substances of benzodiasepine and non-benzodiasepine series (elenium, indoter, campiron and campironin). Spectra of their neurochemical activity were determined in experiments on neurones of isolated spinal ganglia of rats with intracellular biopotentials records. It has been established that GABA-potentiating action of indoter and elenium, dopamine-negative action of campiron and campironin are significant in their anxiolytic action in the states of alarm of aversive genesis of different modalities. Serotoninmimetic effect of non-diasepine tranquilizers is of functional significance in the test of avoidance of \"the lighted ground\", but not of the \"menacing situation\". It is suggested that differences of neurochemical mechanisms of anxiolytic action of the tested tranquilizers testify to different neurochemical profiles of the neuronal \"matrices\" of the studied states of alarm.", 
    "49": "The sedative and cortisol suppressing properties of oxazepam (45 and 60 mg) and nitrazepam (10 and 15 mg) were examined in eight healthy male subjects. The most clear differences between oxazepam and nitrazepam were those seen with respect to the time course and until maximal effect (Tmax) of the different measurements. Nitrazepam showed maximal sedation after 1 h, maximal benzodiazepine level (RRA), and reaction time prolongation after 2 h, and maximal cortisol suppression after 3 h. Oxazepam showed maximal sedation after 2 h, maximal benzodiazepine levels, reaction time prolongation and cortisol suppression after 3 h. After administration of oxazepam (both doses) a transient return to baseline levels of cortisol was demonstrated. Whereas the degree of sedation correlated significantly within drug groups with the concurrent benzodiazepine levels, the Tmax of sedation was recorded 1 h earlier than the peak blood concentration (RRA) for both nitrazepam and oxazepam. The time course for cortisol suppression for the two compounds differed clearly from the other measurements and was not related to the peak blood concentration.", 
    "50": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the comparative effects of rapid vs graded correction of chronic hypoxia in vitro. Cerebral cortical cell cultures obtained from fetal mice were exposed to 5% O2 for 24 h and returned immediately to room air for the following 24 h (Group I); comparable cultures were exposed to 5% O2 for 24 h followed by 10% O2 for an additional 24 h before return to room air (Group II). At the conclusion of the experimental protocol (time 0), partial pressure of oxygen in the bathing medium of Group I cultures was significantly higher than that of Group II and non-hypoxic controls (151 mmHg vs 124 and 132 mmHg, respectively; P less than 0.05). Throughout the recovery period, Group II cultures evidenced improved neuronal survival (e.g. 35,800 vs 17,700 neurons/culture well at time 0, P less than 0.01), decreased lactate dehydrogenase efflux into the bathing medium, relative preservation of neuronal morphology, as well as higher specific and clonazepam-displaceable benzodiazepine binding and GABA uptake. Glutamate binding was not differentially affected and glutamine synthetase activity, a predominantly glial marker, was only modestly increased after graded reoxygenation. These results demonstrate that gradual reoxygenation after prolonged hypoxia in vitro (i) improves neuronal survival compared to rapid reoxygenation and (ii) delays the manifestations of metabolic dysfunction even though the length of hypoxic exposure is increased. The findings are also consistent with the concept that a period of relative hyperoxia may contribute to hypoxia-induced neuronal injury.", 
    "51": "The effects of phencyclidine (PCP) and NPC 12626 on punished responding were examined using a modified Geller-Seifter procedure in rats. Both drugs are known to antagonize N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated neurotransmission, albeit at different sites on the NMDA receptor complex. Rats were trained to lever press for food reinforcement under a multiple schedule, with responding in one component reinforced under a fixed-interval 60-sec schedule, while each response in the other component resulted in both food and brief electric shock. Both PCP and NPC 12626 produced selective increases in punished responding, although the effects were not as large as those produced by chlordiazepoxide. Repeated daily administration of each of these drugs for 6 days resulted in increases in punished responding during different portions of the treatment. A 5 mg/kg dose of chlordiazepoxide produced increases over the last 2 days of administration. PCP (2 mg/kg) produced an increase only during the second session, whereas NPC 12626 (30 mg/kg) produced increases for all but the first and fifth days of the 6-day regimen. Both competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists can have antipunishment effects in this model.",

Among the oxidants tested, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) gave the highest optical and chemical yields, while tert-butyl, tert-amyl, and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl hydroperoxides did not show such high enantio-selectivities.

In order to answer the question of whether the generally assumed two-week washout of psychoactive medication is sufficient for polysomnographic studies, we computed a post hoc analysis of EEG sleep recordings in 61 newly admitted depressed patients. The results indicate that after a 2-week withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines there are no major drug effects on visually scored polysomnograms. In addition, the observations raise the question of whether even a 1-week drug washout may be sufficient to exclude confounding effects of prior psychoactive medication on EEG sleep.",

The images of the intracellular distributions of the two drugs are easily obtained by selecting the fluorine atom of the molecules.

    "55": "The anticonflict activity of m-CPP, a non-selective agonist of 5-HT receptors, was studied in the drinking conflict test in rats. m-CPP administered in doses of 0.125-0.5 mg/kg increased the number of punished licks, the maximum effect having been observed after a dose of 0.25 mg/kg. The anticonflict effect of m-CPP (0.25 mg/kg) was antagonized by the non-selective 5-HT antagonist metergoline (1-4 mg/kg) and by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker SDZ 21009 (2 and 4 mg/kg) with affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. On the other hand, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN-190 (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), and the beta-blockers betaxolol (8 mg/kg) and ICI 118,551 (8 mg/kg) with no affinity for 5-HT receptors did not affect the effect of m-CPP. The effect of m-CPP was not modified, either, in animals with the 5-HT lesion produced by p-chloroamphetamine. These results suggest that the anticonflict effect of m-CPP described above results from stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors--most probably these which are located postsynaptically.",

    "57": "1. Although there is clear evidence for many controlled trials in the past 25 years that beta blockers are effective in anxiety disorders clear indications for their use are lacking. 2. The balance of evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of beta-blocking drugs is through peripheral blockade of beta-mediated symptoms. 3. Most evidence to the efficacy of beta-blockers comes from study of their use in generalized anxiety and in acute stress. 4. Because beta-blockers carry no risks of pharmacological dependence they may be preferred to many other anti-anxiety drugs.", 
    "58": "In earlier studies, it was found that exogenous carbon dioxide administration provoked high anxiety in panic disorder (PD) patients, whereas healthy normals and patients suffering from other anxiety disorders were hardly affected. Breath-holding provides a simple method to induce endogenous CO2 accumulation. Fourteen PD patients, 14 patients suffering from other anxiety disorders, and 14 healthy controls were asked to hold their breath as long as possible. Apnea times appeared to be longer in the normal control group than in the other two groups. Using a one-tailed t test, a trend for a difference was found between the PD subjects and other anxiety patients, the PD patients having slightly lower values. No differences were found with respect to increase in anxiety during breath-holding or the ratio of apnea times before and after hyperventilation.", 
    "59": "The present in vivo study elucidated the effect of other commonly comedicated drugs on the phenytoin (PHT) Scatchard binding parameters. Specimens of 150 epileptic patients chronically treated with anticonvulsant drugs were analyzed. The results of covariance analysis suggest that phenobarbitone, ethosuximide, diazepam and folic acid do not alter binding of PHT to serum albumin. The contribution of carbamazepine and medazepam to the free fraction of PHT (decrease of about 0.4%) and/or Scatchard binding capacity (increase of about 1/3) is ambiguous and not statistically significant at the p less than 0.05 level. On the contrary, we found a statistically significant decrease of PHT binding in patients comedicated with valproic acid (VPA) and primidone (PRM). The decrease of about 25% in binding capacity evoked an increase of about 1% (VPA), and 1.5% (PRM), respectively in PHT free fraction.", 
    "60": "This investigation assessed the mechanisms of Tetrazepam action on spasticity using a battery of electromyographic methods. Thirty patients with post-stroke spastic hemiparesis treated with Tetrazepam took part in the investigation. A questionnaire for assessment of subjective improvement after treatment used a 5-point scale. The 5-point scales were used to assess muscle tone, muscle strength and tendon reflexes. A battery of electromyographic methods was used to analyse different mechanisms of spasticity: for alpha-motoneuron activity--the F-wave parameters; for gamma-motoneuron activity--the TA/H amplitude ratio; for presynaptic inhibition--the ratio of H-reflex maximal amplitudes before and after vibration on the Achilles tendon (Hvibr/Hmax); for common interneuron activity--the flexor reflex parameters. Our results revealed that Tetrazepam reduces tone in spastic muscles and has a slight effect on tendon hyperreflexia. It has no influence on muscle strength, Babinski sign and ankle clonus. Tetrazepam acts by decreasing motoneurone activity and increasing presynaptic inhibition.", 
    "61": "Whilst tricyclic antidepressants are efficacious in all depressive syndromes, classical MAO-inhibitors differ substantially from them in their action. They are considered less effective in general and not very effective in endogenous depression, but recommended for the treatment of 'atypical' depression. A new class of RIMA (Reversible Inhibitors of MAO-A) represented by moclobemide requires a change in clinical thinking on antidepressants. Moclobemide shows the same efficacy in depression as tricyclics: its effects are similar in unipolar and bipolar affective disorders, and in patients with major depressive episode superimposed on dysthymia (double depression). As with classical antidepressants, the response rate tends to be lower, but is still present in psychotic depression. Agitated depressives do not respond less well than non-agitated patients to moclobemide. Patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression with melancholia tend to respond better than non-melancholics, but this may be associated with the significantly higher baseline severity observed in melancholics. A slightly higher response rate in patients without concomitant benzodiazepine treatment, compared to those with benzodiazepine comedication, may also be related to baseline differences in the severity of depression. Elderly depressives respond less well than younger patients to classical antidepressants, but with moclobemide, elderly patients do as well as younger ones.", 
    "62": "The features of panic and anxiety in the natural environment were studied by prospective self-monitoring in 39 patients with chronic agoraphobia and panic disorder. Panics overlapped greatly with anxiety episodes but were more intense. Panics occurred more often in public places than did anxiety episodes, but had otherwise similar symptom profile, time of occurrence, and antecedents. Most panics surged out of a pre-existing plateau of tonic anxiety which lasted most of the day. Spontaneous panics were less frequent than situational panics and occurred more often at home but were otherwise similar. These findings do not support the sharp distinction between panic and anxiety in DSM-III-R, not its emphasis on spontaneous panic in classifying anxiety disorders. Thoughts of dying and 'going crazy'/losing control accompanied only a minority of panic/anxiety episodes and seemed to be a product of intense panic rather than a cause.", 
    "63": "The clinical features and management of nine cases of mushroom poisoning due to Amanita pantherina (eight cases) and Amanita muscaria (one case) admitted to a children's hospital are described. Most ingestions were in the toddler age group with males being more frequently involved. Symptoms occurred between 30-180 min with the onset of central nervous system depression, ataxia, waxing and waning obtundation, hallucinations, intermittent hysteria or hyperkinetic behavior. Vomiting was rare. Seizures or myoclonic twitching occurred in 4/9 patients, but was controlled with standard anticonvulsant therapy. No other anticholinergic or cholinergic signs were prominent. Recovery was rapid and complete in all patients.", 
    "64": "Diazepam (2.0 mg/kg) was injected (IP) into rats 30 min before chlorpromazine (2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg) on ten occasions. All doses of chlorpromazine enhanced the capacity of diazepam to increase rats' exploration of the exposed arms of an elevated plus-maze, an animal screening test for anxiolytic and anxiogenic substances. When maze testing occurred during each of the ten diazepam----chlorpromazine trials (after diazepam but before chlorpromazine), this enhancement effect appeared on Trial 6 and persisted thereafter. Haloperidol (3.0 mg/kg, IP) changed diazepam-elicited plus-maze activity in the same manner as chlorpromazine; however, thioridazine (10.0 mg/kg) and pimozide (2.0 mg/kg) were ineffective. Additionally, haloperidol, like chlorpromazine, was found to reduce diazepam's muscle relaxation effect (inclined plane test) as a consequence of diazepam----haloperidol pairings; once again, thioridazine and pimozide proved ineffective. These results suggested that not all neuroleptics will alter diazepam activity, and also that dopamine blockade per se is not sufficient to induce such changes. While the reasons for the enhanced plus-maze effects of diazepam induced by haloperidol and chlorpromazine remain elusive, the diminished myorelaxant effect may be linked to a neuroleptic's capacity to induce muscular side effects: thioridazine and pimozide are far less likely to yield such effects than are chlorpromazine and haloperidol. Haloperidol administered chronically by itself was found to have an effect on diazepam-induced myorelaxation. Administration of this butyrophenone either orally (2.0 mg/kg daily for 22 days) or in depot form (haloperidol decanoate, 60.0 mg/kg IM once a month for four months) caused a diminished effect of diazepam in rats subjected to the inclined plane test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Pig brain extracts from both soluble and membrane fractions were found to contain potent inhibitors for GABA synthesizing enzyme, GAD, referred to as endogenous GAD inhibitors (EGIs) and for the binding of GABA agonist, muscimol, referred to as muscimol binding inhibitors (MBIs). EGIs and MBIs were first purified through gel-filtration Bio-Gel P-2 columns, in which multiple activity peaks were observed. One of them appears to be co-eluted with either L-glutamate or GABA. However, others are clearly separated from L-glutamate or GABA. EGIs were found to be low MW (less than 1,800 dalton), heat and acid-base stable, negatively charged, non hydrophobic substances. MBIs were found to be low MW (less than 1,800 dalton) neutral or positively charged substances. MBIs had no effect on [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZP) binding, indicating that they are not endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligands and they may act specifically on GABA binding site.", 
    "66": "Direct application of bicuculline methiodide (BIC) to noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons potently enhanced their sensory responsiveness. This increased responsiveness was due to the long-lasting expression of a new, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated component of the synaptic response. This enhancement only occurred when a high stimulus intensity was used to induce the sensory response. A similar increase in responsiveness was observed with stimulation of the nucleus paragigantocellularis (PGi), one of the major direct afferents to LC. This action of BIC was neither mimicked by picrotoxin, penicillin, or the GABA-B antagonist, 2-hydroxy-baclofen, nor by agents that directly depolarize LC neurons. In addition, the inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), did not mimic this effect of BIC. The BIC-potentiated response component was eliminated by direct application of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These results indicate that BIC, acting at a possibly novel site, unmasks NMDA receptors that can be activated by sensory stimuli. This may reflect a mechanism whereby interactions between two major neurotransmitter systems, excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and GABA, potently modulate signal transmission in the brain.", 
    "67": "The density of a drug in solution cannot be determined from a simple formula or from physicochemical tables, because it depends on the physical state of that substance in solution. The densities of agents which have been reported to be administered by the intrathecal route were measured at room and body temperatures. The results were compared with the density of cerebrospinal fluid. At room temperature, most drugs were isobaric with respect to cerebrospinal fluid, but as drugs warmed to body temperature they became relatively hypobaric.", 
    "68": "To determine the relative contributions of neural reflexes and intestinal hormones to the inhibition of gastric acid secretion by intestinal acidification, rats with an extrinsically denervated, transplanted segment of jejunum, and those with an innervated segment of jejunum, were studied. Postoperatively, meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion was measured. When the acid secretory response to intragastric liver extract reached a plateau, graded concentrations of hydrochloric acid or saline were instilled into the jejunal segments. Gastric acid secretion was inhibited by intrajejunal acid (pH 2.5) by 79% in the innervated rats and by 64% in the transplanted group. Thus at a pH of 2.5 there was a 15% greater maximum inhibition of plateau acid response in the innervated rats than in the transplanted rats, presumably because of the extrinsic neural contribution. To examine the hormonal mediators, the effects of a somatostatin monoclonal antibody and a CCK-A receptor antagonist (L 364718) on acid-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion were studied in transplanted rats. Treatment with a somatostatin monoclonal antibody or with L 364718 reduced the acid-induced (pH 2.5) inhibition of gastric acid secretion by 93 and 27%, respectively. Jejunal acidification inhibits gastric acid secretion in the rat by both neural and hormonal mechanisms. The hormonal mechanism is mediated by somatostatin and CCK.", 
    "69": "A single intake of hydroxyzine 25 mg was compared to placebo, and lorazepam 1 mg as a verum, in a double-blind, triple-crossover trial. Each of the 12 elderly volunteers was tested on three different days, once under each condition. At 2.5 hours after drug intake they were assessed or reassessed for attention, immediate and delayed (30') memory, cognitive ability and feelings of anxiety and fatigue. Some subjects mentioned a minimal sedation under hydroxyzine 25 mg and under lorazepam 1 mg, but only hydroxyzine preserved memory and attention, while lorazepam caused clear deficiencies in memory recall.", 
    "70": "Dormicum is a rapidly absorbed up-to date hypnotic of 3-4 hours' duration of action physiologically influencing the phases of normal sleep. In the course of the examination of 26 patients, 21 found the hypnotic action of 7.5-mg or 15-mg Dormicum doses to be highly effective. The drug proved to be an effective hypnotic also in the group of patients above 60 years of age (14). It is of special importance in the everyday practice of a general practitioner that the intake of Dormicum in the evening did not influence the physical and mental activity of the patients the next day.", 
    "71": "The investigations were aimed at the study of effects of preparations which belong to the benzodiazepine group-Clonazepam (CZ), on total bioelectric activity (EEG) and epileptic discharge induced by electrostimulation of the hippocampus in the experimental animals (awake adult rabbits). Clonazepam was administered both intramuscularly (i.m.) and intravenously (i.v.) at a dose of 0.2-2.5 mg/kg of the body mass. The obtained results show that the administration of clonazepam prolongs the duration and the arrangement of the spindle in the bioelectric activity in rabbits and stops epileptic attacks of the grand mal type.", 
    "72": "Substrates used to immobilize hepatocytes for transplantation govern attachment and long-term metabolic activity of these cells. The choice of these substrates is based on the familiarity with proteinaceous materials that are constituents of the extracellular matrix. The use of substrates that recognize carbohydrates on the cell surface may provide an alternative method to attach adult mammalian hepatocytes. In this study, immobilized lectins on tissue culture plasticware were used to support hepatocyte attachment. Long-term cultures with these substrates were compared with control cultures seeded on a mixture of collagen types I and III (Vitrogen). To evaluate the attachment efficiency and long-term maintenance of diazepam metabolic activity of hepatocytes seeded on different commercially available plasticware, four different types of polymers (supplied as 60-mm dishes) were tested. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine metabolized by the P450 intracytoplasmic pathway, is associated with a synaptic receptor (GABA-benzodiazepine receptor) which plays an important role in hepatic coma. Polymethylpentene, a derivative of polypropylene treated by plasma discharge, was the best polymer to maintain P450 phenotypic expression, although other polymers provided similar cell attachment efficiencies. The amounts of adsorbed concanavalin A, Arachis hypogaea (peanut), Lens culinaris, and Pisum sativum agglutinin correlate with the percentage values of hepatocyte attachment. Cell attachment to wheat germ agglutinin increased with increased lectin concentrations in spite of constant amounts of adsorbed lectin, whereas hepatocyte attachment to Bandieraea simplicifolia agglutinin was lower and did not change at different lectin concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
