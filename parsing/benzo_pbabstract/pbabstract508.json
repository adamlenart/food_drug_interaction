    "0": "Studies suggest that the 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam possesses a favorable anticonvulsant profile due to its minimal neurotoxicity. The anticonvulsant and motor impairment effects of clobazam and 2 1,4-benzodiazepine, diazepam and clonazepam, were compared by dose-response analysis in amygdala-kindled rats and on 3 tests of motor function: gross motor impairment, a vertical screen test, and muscle tone. All drugs produced a significant, dose-dependent decrease in the duration of both behavioral and electrographic kindled seizure measures. Forelimb clonus suppression was the most sensitive measure of anticonvulsant drug effect. The order of potency for all effects was clonazepam greater than diazepam greater than clobazam. ED50s for the benzodiazepines' effects on motor impairment were compared to their ability to protect rats from forelimb clonus. Different spectrums of action for the various benzodiazepines were found depending on the comparison measure. Clonazepam had the most favorable ratio of potency for anticonvulsant vs. motor impairment activity when ataxia rating was the comparison measure. Diazepam had the most advantageous profile when the more sensitive screen test was used for comparison. Clobazam was not found to have a superior spectrum of action when compared across these measures. The results emphasize the importance of dose-response analyses and the consideration of behavioral measures used to assess beneficial and adverse effects of anticonvulsants.", 
    "1": "This report describes our experiences with 129 awake oral and nasal fibreoptic intubations in 123 patients considered to be at high risk of aspiration of gastric contents. I.v. sedation was used on all but six occasions. Local anaesthesia was applied to the larynx and trachea through the working channel of the fibrescope on 85 occasions, and by transtracheal injection on 29. Rigid laryngoscopy was necessary after fibreoptic laryngoscopy failed in one patient (with a bleeding peptic ulcer) who vomited a large amount of fresh and clotted blood. No other patient regurgitated during the procedure, and no patient developed evidence of aspiration.", 
    "2": "The interaction of pirprofen with human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated by equilibrium dialysis and spectroscopic (UV absorption, fluorescence, CD, NMR) techniques. It was found that HSA binds pirprofen nonstereospecifically. The binding of pirprofen depends upon the N-B conformational change of albumin. Chloride ions appear to displace the drug from its binding site. The thermodynamic parameters suggest that the interaction may be explained by electrostatic as well as hydrophobic forces. The absorption spectral changes which accompanied the binding of pirprofen to HSA implied that the aromatic portion of drugs was inserted into the hydrophobic crevice in the protein, while the carboxyl group of the drug interacted with a cationic site on the albumin surface. The NMR data indicated that the pyrroline ring and propionic acid parts may be the major binding site for HSA. A specific binding site for pirprofen on the HSA was found to be site II, benzodiazepine site, using fluorescence probes and drug markers. In addition, from the binding data with modified HSA, it seems that Tyr-411 is specifically involved in pirprofen binding.", 
    "3": "We present seven cases of tremor caused by mild head injury without loss of consciousness. The interval between head trauma to onset of symptoms was 1 to 4 weeks. A posture and kinetic tremor of the hands and head occurred unassociated with other neurologic signs. Myoclonic-like jerking was frequently present. Neuroimaging studies were normal. Clonazepam administration resulted in tremor reduction in three patients and propranolol decreased tremor in one patient. A tremor, similar to essential tremor, can be a rare complication of head trauma.", 
    "4": "The role played by muscarinic receptor subtypes in the regulation of the migrating myoelectric complex was investigated in 7 dogs chronically implanted with bipolar electrodes along the small intestine. Pirenzepine (3-300 micrograms/kg i.v.) and atropine (1-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) were used as selective and unselective antagonist, respectively. Atropine (30 micrograms/kg) significantly delayed the onset of the next complex. On the contrary, pirenzepine displayed a biphasic action: low doses (less than 100 micrograms/kg) shortened the cycle period, whereas at 300 micrograms/kg the drug behaved like atropine. Pirenzepine affected the cycle period in the low-dose range by reducing the length of phase I. Both atropine and pirenzepine impaired the migration of the ongoing complex, and significantly reduced the migration velocity of the following one. These findings suggest that the initiation of the migrating myoelectric complex in the dog is under an inhibitory influence mediated by the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype; on the other hand, M2 receptor activation is needed for the onset of the activity front. Finally, both receptor subtypes determine the normal migration of phase III.", 
    "5": "The usual anterior and lateral routes used for superior laryngeal (SL) nerve blocks are not often used because too difficult to carry out. A simpler and easier technique is described, which blocks the SL nerve at the level of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. Because the nerve is not located accurately with this technique, a larger volume of local anaesthetic is required. This technique was tested in 31 patients scheduled for endoscopies with rigid tubes. The mean duration of endoscopy was 30 +/- 10 min. The use of 8 ml 1% lidocaine for the block 30 min surgical anaesthesia. In 2 patients, the SL nerve block alone was sufficient. In 26 others a complement with a benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam, n = 9, mean dose 0.8 mg; midazolam, n = 17, mean dose 5 mg) was required. In 4 of these patients, attempts of oesophagoscopy gave rise to hypertension and tachycardia. General anaesthesia with propofol and tracheal intubation were therefore used. In the last 3 patients, intercricothyroid jet ventilation was used, requiring general anaesthesia (propofol and succinylcholine). The SL nerve block was satisfactory in 24 patients with total vocal cord paralysis and no haemodynamic reaction to painful stimuli in the blocked area. No complication was observed. It is concluded that this technique is useful and easier to carry out than the usual ones.", 
    "6": "Adverse effects related to clozapine were assessed within a post-marketing drug surveillance program, the AMUP study, in two university psychiatric departments. In a randomly selected sample of patients (intensive drug monitoring) ADRs of any type were observed in 76% of clozapine-treated inpatients. Sedation, hypersalivation, increase in transaminases, and EEG changes were most frequently observed, but only rarely required changes in therapy. In 8.1% of 959 patients exposed to clozapine in the total inpatient population of the participating hospitals ADR led to withdrawal of clozapine; in 3.9% reactions judged as severe and potentially life-threatening occurred. Among these latter toxic delirium prevailed. In addition, four cases of severe cardiovascular and respiratory dysregulation were observed with the combination of clozapine and benzodiazepines. These cases and one case of sudden death under clozapine and haloperidol treatment are presented in some detail. The results obtained for clozapine are compared to data from this drug surveillance program for other neuroleptics.", 
    "7": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of oral codeine and oxazepam on afternoon cortisol secretion. Nine subjects received either oxazepam (30 mg) or codeine (30 mg) or placebo at 1700h on separate days in a counterbalanced design; the subjects were not aware of the sequence. Blood samples were collected with an indwelling intravenous catheter at 30-min intervals from 1500h to 1630h. Codeine, but not oxazepam, suppressed cortisol secretion. The trend of the declining cortisol values following codeine was significantly linear. These results are consistent with other evidence indicating the presence of an inhibitory opioid mechanism in the human hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The cortisol response to codeine may be a reliable and potentially useful paradigm for the study of the role of opioidergic mechanisms in HPA axis dysfunction.", 
    "8": "DF 594, 11-(N-methylnipecotyl)-6,11-dihydro-5H-pyrido[2,3-b]-1,5-benzod iazepin-5-one hydrochloride, is a new antimuscarinic compound endowed with high affinity for intestinal muscarinic receptors and showing potent inhibitory effects on intestinal motility. This study investigated the intestinal motor effects of DF 594 in fasting, conscious dogs, chronically fitted with electrodes and strain gauges along the small bowel. In a first series of experiments, we assessed the antispasmodic activity of the compound by comparing the ability of intravenous DF 594 or atropine to antagonize the stimulatory effect of bethanechol (100 micrograms/kg s.c.). ED50 values for inhibition of bethanechol-stimulated contractions were 13.9 (8.8-21.8) and 4.0 (1.8-8.7) micrograms/kg for DF 594 and atropine, respectively. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the effects of intravenous DF 594 and atropine on the migrating motor complex (MMC), monitoring heart rate as well. Similarly to atropine (30-100 micrograms/kg), DF 594 (100-300 micrograms/kg) blocked the further migration of an ongoing MMC and significantly delayed the onset of the following MMC. Unlike atropine, DF 594 had only a minor effect on heart rate at the highest dose tested (300 micrograms/kg). These data indicate that DF 594 is an effective antispasmodic agent at doses lower than those required to interfere with the MMC and is also less likely than atropine to induce cardiac side effects.", 
    "9": "The effects of a potent cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, L-364,718, on two forms of experimental acute pancreatitis in mice were evaluated. The antagonist prevented the hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema, and acinar cell vacuolization that followed administration of a supramaximally stimulating dose of the cholecystokinin analogue cerulein. In contrast, the same dose of L-364,718 (1 mg/kg/6 h) and an even higher dose (10 mg/kg/6 h) failed to prevent the hyperamylasemia, acinar cell necrosis, and mortality that followed administration of a choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet. These observations are at variance with those previously reported to follow administration of the relatively weak cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide (Niederau C et al. J Clin Invest 1986;78:1056-63). The observations reported in this communication suggest that cholecystokinin does not play an important role in diet-induced pancreatitis and that CCK receptor antagonists are unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of clinical acute pancreatitis.", 
    "10": "The effect of L-364,718, a cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, on exocrine pancreatic secretion, gastric secretion, and plasma levels of gastrointestinal (GI) peptides stimulated by gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) was examined in five conscious dogs. Intravenous infusion of graded doses of synthetic porcine GRP (18, 36, and 178 pmol/kg/h) caused significant and dose-dependent increases in pancreatic and gastric juice secretion and in plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide (PP), CCK, and gastrin. Intravenous injection of L-364,718 (20 nmol/kg) significantly inhibited GRP-stimulated pancreatic outputs of juice volume, protein, and amylase and plasma PP release. L-364,718, however, did not affect gastric juice volume and plasma levels of CCK and gastrin. The results suggest that endogenously released CCK is, at least in part, responsible for GRP-stimulated pancreatic protein and enzyme secretions and PP release in dogs. The results further suggest that GRP-stimulated pancreatic secretion might be, in part, a direct response of GRP to exocrine pancreas.", 
    "11": "The ability of the putative ethanol antagonist RO 15-4513 to antagonize ethanol - induced hypoactivity, hypothermia and hyperglycemia was investigated in rats. Although RO 15-4513 produced hypoactivity by itself, it attenuated ethanol - induced hypoactivity. This antagonism suggests that ethanol - induced hypoactivity is mediated by the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex which is thought to be the site of action of RO 15-4513. In contrast, although RO 15-4513 produced hypothermia by itself, it had no significant effect on ethanol - induced hypothermia. This suggests that the hypothermic effect of ethanol is not mediated by the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The fact that RO 15-4513, ethanol and the vehicle all produced hyperglycemia suggests a common stress effect and does not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn as to the interaction between ethanol and RO 15-4513 in modulating glycemic responses. These data indicate that the ethanol antagonism of RO 15-4513 is primarily confined to ethanol's behavioural effects and that ethanol's behavioural and physiological effects are mediated by neurochemically distinct mechanisms.", 
    "12": "Diazepam has been reported to decrease the cardiac toxicity of chloroquine but the precise mechanism involved remains unknown. Left ventricular papillary muscles from adult Wistar rats were exposed to 10(-4) M chloroquine and assigned to three groups: group I (n = 10) exposed to chloroquine alone; group II (n = 8) exposed to chloroquine and 10(-5) M diazepam; group III (n = 8) exposed to chloroquine and 10(-4) M diazepam. The main mechanical parameters measured were: maximum unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax), maximum lengthening velocity (maxVr), active force normalized per cross-sectional area (AF/s), contraction-relaxation coupling under low load (R1), load sensitivity of relaxation (Isot.A/Isom.A), and peak power output (Emax) determined from Hill's equation of the force-velocity curve. Data are expressed as mean percent of control values +/- SD, for groups I, II, III respectively. No differences between groups I, II, and III were noted for Vmax (87 +/- 13, 82 +/- 9, 86 +/- 7), maxVr (47 +/- 6, 48 +/- 11, 52 +/- 11), AF/s (87 +/- 16, 91 +/- 10, 83 +/- 11), Isot. A/Isom. A (113 +/- 9, 108 +/- 3, 109 +/- 7), or Emax (75 +/- 10, 81 +/- 12, 72 +/- 16). Chloroquine was shown to be a negative inotropic agent since it decreased Vmax, AF/s and Emax, but diazepam did not restore the intrinsic mechanical performance of rat cardiac papillary muscle exposed to chloroquine, therefore 1) the protective cardiovascular effects of diazepam in chloroquine poisoning are not related to an improvement in intrinsic cardiac mechanical properties; 2) inotropic agents are therefore necessary in combination with diazepam for the treatment of severe chloroquine poisoning.", 
    "13": "Forty-six orthopedic patients were studied to determine the incidence, natural history, and risk factors associated with post-operative delirium. Pre-operatively, patients were given a neuropsychological screening evaluation, the Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL), the Zung Depression Scale, the Anxiety Inventory Scale, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). A psychiatrist interviewed each patient on post-op day four for evidence of delirium as defined by DSM III criteria. Of the patients studied, thirteen (26%) were possibly or definitely delirious following surgery. Treatment with propranolol, scopolamine, or flurazepam (Dalmane) conferred a relative risk for delirium of 11.7 (p = 0.0028). Delirium was associated with increased post-operative complications (p = 0.01), poorer post-operative mood (p = 0.06), and an increase of about 1.5 days in length of stay (not significant). Delirious patients were significantly less likely than matched controls to improve in function at six months compared with a pre-operative baseline HAQ (t = 6.43, p less than 0.001).", 
    "14": "In Ophthalmic practice diazepam is often used a a premedicant. We report a case where administration of diazepam led to a state of acute delirium because of which surgery had to be postponed. The possible mechanisms for this reaction and the treatment is discussed. This side effect of diazepam should be kept in mind while dealing with delirium in the geriatric age group.", 
    "15": "The effects of the selective muscarinic M1-receptor antagonist pirenzepine and the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine on bombesin- and peptone-stimulated release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were studied in healthy subjects. To exclude any effect of changes in intraduodenal pH continuous intragastric titration was performed during all tests. Both pirenzepine (i.v. bolus 0.6 mg/kg) and atropine (i.v. bolus 15 micrograms/kg, followed by an infusion of 5 micrograms/kg.h) significantly reduced peptone-induced integrated mean rise of plasma PP from 28 +/- 5 to 8 +/- 4 and -2 +/- 5 pmol/l, respectively (n = 4). Both drugs also reduced bombesin-induced rise of plasma PP in all 4 subjects, from 27 +/- 12 to 6 +/- 4 and 7 +/- 1 pmol/l (0.05 less than p less than 0.1). It is concluded that cholinergic regulation of PP release is mediated mainly through muscarinic M1-receptors.", 
    "16": "The experiments were carried out in the younger adult (3 to 5 months of age) normotensive rats of Wistar strain and in the genetically hypertensive rats which were developed by Koletsky; the experiments were performed in both sexes. The behaviour of control and diazepam treated rats were traced in the holeboard and in the elevated plus-maze. In the control animals when compared to the normotensive rats of both sexes, the genetically hypertensive rats of both sexes show elevated aversion towards open space and hight (when the number of visits of centre and open arms is considered), and elevated total time of locomotor-exploratory activity; the hypertensive males show decrease and female increase in time spent and in number of head-dipping. Diazepam at both doses (0.5-1.0 mg/kg b. w.) alleviates aversion towards open space and hight in the elevated plus-maze only in the genetically hypertensive rats. Directed exploration (head-dipping) was increased in the genetically hypertensive rats of both sexes at both doses of diazepam; at higher dose directed exploration was decreased in the normotensive males. Diazepam shows no effect in the between-session habituation of directed exploration in the normotensive rats of both sexes; in the genetically hypertensive rats instead of the between-session habituation of directed exploration, in the second session (relative to the first one) there appeared elevation of directed exploration.", 
    "17": "The effects of the triazolobenzodiazepine anxiolytic, alprazolam, on the incidence of ischemia- and reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias was studied in the isolated buffer-perfused rat heart. Administration of alprazolam before and after myocardial ischemia resulted in a dosage-dependent reduction in the incidence and duration of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation and was significant at a concentration of 1 X 10(-3) mol/l alprazolam. This cardioprotective effect was not extended to ischemia-induced ventricular dysrhythmias. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that benzodiazepine drugs are able to provide a cardioprotective effect in the experimental setting of myocardial ischemia followed by coronary reperfusion.", 
    "18": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam has been studied in patients recovering from cardiac surgery, who required sedation for postoperative mechanical ventilation. Twelve males (mean age 64.5 years) with severe heart disease received an infusion of midazolam 15 mg.h-1 for 4 h, starting 1 to 3 h post surgery. Multiple blood samples were collected from each patient during the infusion and up to 48-93 h after it. The pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam were determined using both moment analysis and the program NONMEM. The average terminal half-life was 10.6 h. The prolonged elimination was mainly due to a decrease in its metabolic clearance (0.25 l.min-1). The maintenance infusion dose of midazolam in such patients should be reduced. The time to recovery after stopping an infusion depends upon the amount of drug in the body at that time and a simulation of the plasma concentrations after various infusion regimens suggests that recovery will be delayed after prolonged (greater than 48 h) administration of midazolam to these patients. However, after shorter infusions (less than 12 h), redistribution of the drug away from the site of action was still occurring and recovery would be expected to be relatively rapid.", 
    "19": "We have studied the acute effect of trimipramine (25, 50 and 75 mg) on nocturnal sleep in 6 young men. Fluoxetine (60 mg) and diazepam (10 mg) were included as controls for the potential changes in sleep measures. Trimipramine reduced awake activity, Stage 1 (drowsy) sleep, and the duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Non-REM (Stage 2) sleep was increased. Residual effects of trimipramine were present the next morning (9 h after ingestion) with impaired coding ability. The effects of trimipramine on sleep and daytime alertness are consistent with its complex pharmacological profile. Reduced wakefulness and sedation are most likely due to synergism between histamine H1, alpha 1-adrenoceptor, and dopamine receptor antagonism. Anticholinergic activity and possibly blockade of alpha 1-adrenoceptors would disturb the balance of transmitter activities which facilitates the optimal appearance of REM sleep. In this way the effects of trimipramine on nocturnal wakefulness and REM sleep are similar to drugs which inhibit the uptake of noradrenaline.", 
    "20": "The possible interference with 5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)-imidazole-4-carboxamide (DTIC)-mediated chemical xenogenization (CX) by antiemetic drugs was studied. DTIC was given alone or in combination with either dexamethasone or metoclopramide plus orphenadrine hydrochloride plus diazepam to CD2F1 mice bearing the histocompatible L1210 leukemia. Tumor cells were collected from treated animals and inoculated into histocompatible untreated and drug-treated recipients, for eight transplant generations. More than 50% of intact hosts rejected tumor cells between the fourth and sixth transplant generation, independently of antiemetic treatments. Positive controls treated with DTIC plus quinacrine (QC) confirmed that this antimutagenic compound entirely abrogates CX. The present results point out that the antiemetic regimens investigated in this study do not prevent CX. Since DTIC treatment requires intensive antiemetic support in man, these data are of clinical relevance for CX-oriented immunochemotherapy protocols.", 
    "21": "Effects of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine(MPP+), a putative neurotoxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP), on the contents of dopamine were examined in the various regions of the rat brain. Under anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium and flunitrazepam, MPP+ 150 micrograms/rat was intracerebroventricularly infused for 5 hours, at 30 micrograms/100 microliters/hr. Seven days later, the contents of dopamine, but not those of noradrenaline and activities of choline acetyl transferase in the brain were found to be significantly decreased, as compared to findings in the respective controls. The MPP+-induced depletion of dopamine was most evident in the striatum (38% of control). Contents of dopamine in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area were not significantly affected by MPP+. These results are interpreted to mean that intracerebroventricular continuous infusion of MPP+, in a relatively low concentration, induces a moderate but relatively specific disruption of central dopaminergic nerve terminals in rats, presumably by the selective accumulation of this neurotoxic agent into these nerve terminals.", 
    "22": "Midazolam is gradually replacing diazepam in neuroleptanalgesia with fentanyl and sufentanil because of its greater water solubility, greater hypnotic potency, shorter half-life, lack of pharmacologically active metabolites and low incidence of thrombophlebitis. In order to substantiate midazolam as being as safe and effective as diazepam in cardiac patients with severe coronary occlusion, hemodynamic measurements were made before and 10 min after completion of intravenous injection of 0.2 mg/kg i.v. midazolam (n = 45) and 0.4 mg/kg i.v. diazepam (n = 30), the doses which are identical to those used in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. All 75 patients were spontaneously breathing 40% O2 in air. No positional changes or stimulation of patients were allowed before and during the study. Of hemodynamic variables, systemic systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by both midazolam and diazepam. Midazolam also caused significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance with reduction in diastolic pressure and left ventricular stroke work index. No changes in heart rate, systolic and diastolic pulmonary artery pressures, cardiac output and index, stroke volume and index, pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular stroke work index and rate pressure product were observed following either midazolam or diazepam. No statistically significant differences were observed in any hemodynamic variable between those patients receiving midazolam or diazepam. It is concluded that midazolam is as safe as diazepam in cardiac patients with coronary obstruction.", 
    "23": "1. 5'(Isobutylthio)-adenosine (SIBA) and its analogs, at 100 microM, inhibited [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine binding to homogenates of whole brain and cortex (mainly M1 subtype receptors) by 11-30% and to cerebellum (mainly M2 subtype receptors) by 20-39%. 2. At 0.01-1.0 microM, stimulation of [3H]QNB and NMS-inaccessible [3H]QNB binding was observed, with the most induced by 1 microM 3-deaza-SIBA. 3. In contrast, [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) binding to whole brain and cortex was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with Ki values in the microM range. 4. As antagonists of acetylcholine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum (mainly M2 subtype receptors), the analogs were slightly more potent than pirenzepine, but several orders of magnitude less than atropine; the order of potency was opposite that determined for the binding of [3H]PZ to cortex. 5. Thus, SIBA and its analogs may have differential effects on muscarinic receptor subtypes and show some specificity for the M1 receptor subtype.", 
    "24": "Four anticancer agents, neothramycin, aclacinomycin, FK-565 and FK-156, were tested for their effects on concanavalin-A-induced interleukin-2 release from rat splenocytes in vitro. Neothramycin showed an enhancement of the release of interleukin-2, whereas aclacinomycin had no effect. FK-565 and FK-156 were found to inhibit the release of interleukin-2 under similar conditions. The inhibition was much more marked with FK-565. These drugs were also tested for their effects on the release of interleukin-1 from rat peritoneal exudate cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide in vitro. Neothramycin and aclacinomycin did not affect the release of interleukin-1; however, both FK-565 and FK-156 resulted in its enhanced release under these conditions.", 
    "25": "The distribution of muscarinic-M2 receptors in rat brain was investigated by in vitro autoradiography using [3H]AF-DX 116, a putative probe for the muscarinic-M2 receptor subtype. Incubation of rat brain coronal sections with 10 nM [3H]AF-DX 116 showed highest binding site densities in discrete areas such as the superior colliculus and certain thalamic and brainstem nuclei, similar to the distribution reported for [2H]acetylcholine/M2 sites. [3H]AF-DX 116 site densities were markedly lower in forebrain areas such as cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, in contrast to the distribution seen for [3H]pirenzepine-M1 binding sites, which were concentrated in these forebrain areas; however, differential patterns of labeling were observed for the two muscarinic-M2 probes, [3H]AF-DX 116 and [3H]acetylcholine, in the hippocampal formation. Although [3H]AF-DX 116 binding was broadly distributed in multiple subfields of the hippocampus, [3H]acetylcholine binding was discretely distributed in a manner resembling that of acetylcholinesterase staining. This suggests the existence of muscarinic-M2 subtypes in the CNS, especially in the hippocampal formation.", 
    "26": "This study shows that [3H]AF-DX 116 binds specifically, saturably, and with high affinity to putative muscarinic-M2 receptor sites in the rat brain. In homogenates of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum, [3H]AF-DX 116 appears to bind two subpopulations of muscarinic sites: one class of higher affinity sites (Kd less than 4.0 nM) and one class of lower affinity sites (Kd greater than 50 nM, except in the cerebellum). The apparent maximal capacities (Bmax) of [3H]AF-DX 116 sites in forebrain tissues ranged between 34 and 69 fmol/mg protein for the higher affinity site, and between 197 and 451 fmol/mg protein for the lower affinity site. In cerebellar homogenates, the maximal capacity of [3H]AF-DX 116 binding sites was 10.4 +/- 0.4 (Kd = 1.9 +/- 0.2 nM) and 39.1 +/- 2.6 (Kd = 26 +/- 7 nM) fmol/mg protein for the higher and the lower affinity site, respectively. Determination of the Kd for the higher and lower affinity [3H]AF-DX 116 sites from association and dissociation constants yielded similar values to those obtained from the saturation data. The ligand selectivity pattern reveals that AF-DX 116 is more potent than (-)QNB greater than atropine greater than methoctramine greater than 4-DAMP greater than gallamine greater than NMS greater than carbamylcholine greater than oxotremorine greater than pirenzepine much greater than nicotine in competing for the higher affinity [3H]AF-DX 116 sites. With few exceptions, the pattern was similar for the lower affinity sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "1. The paper presents a naturalistic study of 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and treatment response in panic disorder. 2. Twenty-eight patients unmedicated for at least one month were entered in a study of MHPG in panic disorder, and given the option of continuing or not continuing treatment. 3. At baseline and on average follow-up 6.8 months later, patients continuing in treatment had significantly lower MHPG than those who did not. 4. At baseline, the two groups of patients did not differ significantly as to number of panic attacks, Zung anxiety scale, and Beck and Hamilton Depression scales. 5. Treated patients did better on all clinical measures at follow-up. 6. Low MHPG may be related to persistence in seeking treatment for panic disorder, and perhaps to treatment response.", 
    "28": "Attacks of sustained dystonic postures of limbs and trunk can be initiated by mild environmental stimuli in an inbred line of Syrian hamsters. The trait is determined by an autosomal simple recessive genetic mutation, originally designated by the gene symbol sz, because the abnormal movements were thought to represent epileptic seizures. The attacks, which can be reproducibly initiated by placing the sz mutant hamsters in a new environment, begin with rapid twitches of the vibrissae, flattened ears, and flattened posture of the trunk while walking, followed by facial contortions, rearing, and sustained posturing of trunk and limbs, often resulting in falling over to the side or backwards. In the final stage, the hamsters became immobile, which can last for hours. An increased tone of limbs and trunk muscles can be palpated during the attack. Electromyographical recordings in awake, unrestrained mutant hamsters showed that the onset of the attack coincided with continuous tonic muscle activity and phasic bursts, which were present even when the animals did not move. During the attack, the animals continue to react to external stimuli. Bilateral electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings before and during motor disturbances in sz mutant hamsters showed no abnormalities. The severity of the dystonic syndrome in hamsters is age dependent with a peak at about 30-40 days of age. A score system for grading type and severity of dystonic attack was developed for use in drug activity studies. The severity of the attack was reduced or attacks were completely prevented by diazepam (1-2.5 mg/kg i.p.) and valproic acid (100-400 mg/kg i.p.) in a dose-dependent fashion. The latency to dystonic movements was significantly increased by diazepam but markedly reduced by subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazol (40 mg/kg s.c.). Diazepam antagonized the latency-reducing action of pentylenetetrazol in the hamsters. The pathophysiology and pharmacological sensitivity of the dystonic attacks in these animals remain to be further clarified, but the data indicate that the sz mutant hamsters might represent an interesting genetic model for paroxysmal dystonia. In view of these data, we propose that the hamster mutation should be re-named dystonic and that the new gene symbol should be designated dtsz.", 
    "29": "Levodopa-induced onset and end-of-dose dyskinesia are rare but disabling disorders. Although they can be attenuated by increasing and dividing the daily dose of levodopa, this does not constitute a therapeutic approach. In this pilot study, etybenzatropine, an anticholinergic drug, and diazepam, a selective benzodiazepine, were administered in addition to a single dose of levodopa in nine patients with Parkinson's disease. Both drugs tended to decrease the severity and the duration of onset and end-of-dose dyskinesia and to increase the duration of action of levodopa on parkinsonian symptoms.", 
    "30": "The convulsant properties of xanthine amine congener (XAC, 8-(4-(2-aminoethyl)-aminocarboxylmethyloxy)phenyl-1,3-dipropylxant hine) are compared to those of caffeine. Male Swiss albino mice were infused with convulsants through a lateral tail vein. Convulsion thresholds (i.e. the amount of convulsants required to elicit convulsions) of 39.8 +/- 2.0 mg/kg (n = 10) and 109.8 +/- 2.3 mg/kg (n = 10) were calculated for XAC and caffeine respectively. Pretreatment of animals with the adenosine receptor agonists 2-chloroadenosine, N6-cyclohexyladenosine or 5'-N-ethylcarboxamido-adenosine (1 mg/kg, i.p., 20 minutes prior to infusion) significantly decreased the seizure threshold of both XAC and caffeine. The adenosine uptake blockers, 6-nitrobenzylthioinosine or dipyridamole (0.25 mg/kg, i.p., 20 minutes prior to infusion) did not significantly affect the seizure threshold to either XAC or caffeine. The benzodiazepine agonist diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p., 20 minutes prior to infusion) significantly increased the seizure threshold to both XAC (p less than 0.05) and caffeine (p less than 0.01), whereas the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg, i.p., 20 minutes prior to infusion) significantly increased the seizure threshold to caffeine (p less than 0.01), but not XAC. The results suggest that actions at benzodiazepine receptors may be a tenable hypothesis to explain the convulsant actions of caffeine, but not those of XAC.", 
    "31": "Data on forged prescriptions in Sweden in 1982-1986 were studied as an indicator in an epidemiological survey of medication abuse. The annual number of prescription forgeries doubled during the 5-year period. Psychotropic drugs accounted for 62% and analgesics for 25% of all forgeries. Benzodiazepines were the major single drug group, comprising 52% of all forgeries during the period. The major benzodiazepines on the market in Sweden (diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam and flunitrazepam) were the subject of largest number of forgeries. When calculated in relation to the utilization (either total sales or the number of prescriptions), the analgesics codeine, pentazocine and ketobemidone were clearly at the head of the list, suggesting greater abuse liability of these drugs. It is suggested that the data on forged prescriptions can be used as a \"signalling mechanism\" in epidemiological surveillance of medication abuse, aimed at detecting changes in the prevalence as well as in the pattern of abuse.",

Such an understanding may provide a foundation for therapies aimed at prevention or perhaps even cure of some forms of human epilepsy.", 
    "33": "Fifty patients suffering from the alcohol dependence syndrome were detoxified over a 10-day period using a reducing regime of chlordiazepoxide. Twenty-four had been consuming minor tranquillisers together with alcohol prior to admission. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome was assessed daily but no differences were found between the 26 who had taken alcohol alone and the 24 who had taken a combination of alcohol and drugs. Four from each group had a transient hallucinosis and none had fits.", 
    "34": "The M2-cholinoceptor subtype selective antagonist AF-DX 116 was compared with atropine with respect to effects on heart rate and salivary flow in healthy volunteers. These effects were related with in vitro occupancy of M-cholinoceptor subtypes in radioreceptor assays of plasma samples. Radioreceptor assays comprised M1-cholinoceptors in bovine cerebral cortex and M2-cholinoceptors in pig heart and rat salivary gland membranes. 3H-pirenzepine served as a label in the cerebral cortex 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine in the heart and gland preparations. Oral administration of 240 mg AF-DX 116 led to a time dependent increase in heart rate with a maximum effect comparable to atropine 40 micrograms/kg i.v. The effects of both drugs on heart rate were matched by a greater than 80% occupancy of heart M2-cholinoceptors in the radioreceptor assay of plasma samples. In contrast to the complete inhibition of salivary flow after atropine, AF-DX 116 induced an increase of salivation. The effects on salivary flow coincided with a greater than 80% occupancy of glandular M2-cholinoceptors after atropine but no detectable occupancy after AF-DX 116. Occupancy of the M1-subtype amounted to 61.7% after AF-DX 116 and a blockade of inhibitory, presynaptic M1-autoreceptors at missing postsynaptic blockade of glandular M2-cholinoceptors might explain the hypersalivation induced by AF-DX 116.", 
    "35": "The drugs currently used in the emergency management of seizures are chiefly phenytoin, phenobarbital, diazepam, lorazepam, and paraldehyde. The combination of intravenous phenytoin and lorazepam has the advantages of rapid onset of action, sustained efficacy, and freedom from drug interactions. The intermittent oral or rectal administration of diazepam is especially useful for acute home treatment of recurrent seizures. Phenytoin prodrug (ACC-9653), an investigational new drug, is promptly absorbed after intramuscular injection. Unlike phenytoin, it does not require propylene glycol and high alkalinity for solubility and therefore does not produce soft-tissue injury after parenteral administration. It appears to be close to an ideal drug for the emergency management of seizures.", 
    "36": "Twelve normal subjects aged 24-41 years, and 12 subjects aged 62-79 years, received single 50-mg doses of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride by mouth and by intravenous injection on two occasions. Chlordiazepoxide volume of distribution was significantly correlated with body weight (r = 0.63, p less than 0.001), but was not related to age or sex. Among male subjects, elimination half-life was prolonged (20 vs. 8 h, p less than 0.025) and clearance reduced (20 vs. 43 ml/min, p less than 0.05) in elderly as opposed to young volunteers. Among women, there was no significant difference between elderly and young subjects in elimination half-life (12 vs. 13 h) or clearance (29 vs. 22 ml/min). Absolute bioavailability of oral chlordiazepoxide was not less than 100%, and was unrelated to age or sex. Among 20 subjects who received a single 1.0- to 1.2-gram intravenous dose of antipyrine on another occasion, clearance of chlordiazepoxide and of antipyrine were significantly correlated (r = 0.62, p less than 0.01). Like many other low-clearance oxidatively metabolized compounds, chlordiazepoxide clearance is reduced and half-life prolonged in elderly men, but not elderly women. Individual variations in chlordiazepoxide clearance are significantly correlated with those of antipyrine, a drug commonly used as an index of hepatic oxidizing capacity.", 
    "37": "The present study was aimed at investigating the alterations of the spontaneous saccadic eye movements of pigmented rats following ethanol administration. In addition we have studied the efficacy of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 in reversing the effects of alcohol on saccades. The horizontal component of spontaneous eye movements was recorded by means of the magnetic field search coil technique on 11 head-restrained, pigmented rats. After the intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (1 g/kg) spontaneous saccades showed: i) a backward post-saccadic drift, with an exponential-like time course (time constant 100-150 ms); ii) a remarkable reduction of mean saccadic amplitude, up to 37% of control; iii) a significant decrease of peak velocity, which was reduced to about 80% of control. All these effects appeared and developed within a few minutes after the administration and were still present one hour later. When Ro 15-4513 (5 mg/kg) was injected i.p., 15 min after ethanol, the post-saccadic drift amplitude was immediately reduced and the drift was completely abolished within about 30 min. Mean saccadic amplitude returned to control values within a few minutes and was then steadily maintained for the following period examined (30 min). On the contrary, peak velocity showed only a slight tendency to recover which never was significant. When the same dose of Ro 15-4513 was injected alone there was no post-saccadic drift. However, mean saccadic amplitude increased, almost immediately, up to 160% of control. Its value showed a slight constant decrease in the following 30 min. Peak velocity was only slightly increased (up to 106% of control), but never was significantly different from control. Our results show that ethanol induces a remarkable impairment in the performance of spontaneous saccades. The imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 is able to reverse completely only some of the alcohol-induced alterations, i.e. the post-saccadic drift and the reduction of saccadic amplitude, while it fails to counter efficiently the reduction of peak velocity. Ro 15-4513 exerts an intrinsic action, which is opposite to that of ethanol, on some of the saccadic parameters we have examined.", 
    "38": "1. Six consecutive patients with idiopathic spasmodic torticollis (ST) in whom initial amelioration with lorazepam was lost, improved following withdrawal from high doses of lorazepam (3 entered remission or virtual remission; 3 showed marked to moderate improvement). None of 12 control patients improved. 2. The possibility that benzodiazepine-receptor mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology of ST is proposed to explain these findings.", 
    "39": "1. Rat plasma corticosterone increases during 2 hr restraint stress. The animals then exhibit hypophagia and decreased locomotion occurs on placement 24 hr later in an open field. Repeating the restraint daily for 5-7 days leads to adaptation. Failure to adapt is the depression model which is associated with three factors implicated in the illness ie increased plasma glucocorticoid level, female sex and inadequate 5-HT function as revealed by behavioural response to the agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl 5-HT. However, the greater stress induced rise of corticosterone in female rats may reflect a greater response to activation of hypothalamic 5-HT receptors mediating corticoid release. 2. The model responds appropriately to chronic antidepressant pretreatment. Single injections of 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, ipsapirone, gepirone) but not of benzodiazepine anxiolytics have similar effects. Therefore, 5-HT1A agonists may have antidepressant activity. Both behavioural and neurochemical evidence indicates that the adaptive effects of 5-HT1A agonists on the depression model are associated with desensitisation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors.", 
    "40": "1. The anticonflict and the rotarod impairing effects of the triazolo-benzodiazepine alprazolam (APZ) and the conventional 1,4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) diazepam (DIZ) were studied in the rat. 2. After acute administration the two drugs displayed approximately equal potency with respect to anticonflict effects in Vogel's conflict test and in Montgomery's conflict test. The results obtained in the former model indicate that also the efficacies of the two drugs are approximately equal. The shapes of the dose response curves obtained in this model differed, however, markedly. Thus, while APZ displayed a wide high efficacy dose-range (0.5-16.0 mg/kg), a maximal effect of DIZ was obtained in a narrow dose-range only (around 4.0 mg/kg). 3. Acutely, APZ was more rotarod impairing than DIZ; total impairment after 2.0 mg/kg of APZ and 3.5 mg/kg of DIZ. 4. After daily treatment with doses producing approximately equal and close to maximal anticonflict effects (APZ 1.25 mg/kg/day; DIZ 3.0 mg/kg/day) tolerance developed to the rotarod impairing (6 days of treatment) and the anticonflict (Vogel's conflict test; 9 days of treatment) effects of both drugs. It appeared, however, as if tolerance was more pronounced to the ataxic/sedative effects (approximately a four-fold rightward shift of the dose-response curve) than to the anticonflict effect (approximately a two-fold shift) of APZ, whereas tolerance developed to about the same extent to the two effects of DIZ (approximately two-fold shifts). 5. In conclusion, for APZ, but not for DIZ, after long-term administration of a dose producing marked anxiolytic-like effects, the relationship anxiolytic-like effect vs. ataxic/sedative effects was altered. These findings offer a tentative explanation to the putative advantage of APZ over conventional BDZs in the treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "41": "1. A phase I study of buspirone was conducted in 7 healthy male volunteers. 2. Diazepam was selected as the control drug and administered in equipotent doses to buspirone. Dosage was initiated at 2.5mg and doubled until a maximum dosage of 20mg was attained. Subsequently, 10mg was administered once a day for three consecutive days. 3. Clinico-pharmacologically both drugs produced sleepiness/drowsiness, but dizziness, light-headed feeling and feeling of drunkenness were marked only in the diazepam group. 4. No drug-related abnormalities were observed in clinical laboratory test values, endocrinological tests and ECG. 5. On the Uchida-Kraepelin test, no change with the control values was observed under buspirone but subjects administered diazepam exhibited marked deterioration during the latter half of the test. Moreover, in the tapping test, significant impairment was observed in the diazepam group whereas buspirone had no effect. 6. On the EEG some fast waves were observed with diazepam whereas buspirone exhibited slow waves.", 
    "42": "In an experimental model of bleeding-induced hypovolemic shock causing the death of all saline-treated rats within 26 +/- 4 min, the intravenous injection of bombesin (2.5, 5 or 10 micrograms/kg) dose-dependently restored blood pressure, pulse amplitude, heart rate and respiratory function, and improved survival rate as assessed at the end of the experiment (2 h). The effect on cardiovascular and respiratory functions was prompt (within 1-2 min) and sustained. The release of cholecystokinin seems to be the main mechanism of action, because the anti-shock effect of bombesin is largely prevented by the CCK-antagonist, L-364,718.", 
    "43": "Over a 3 week period the hypnotic effect of zopiclone 7.5 mg, temazepam 20 mg and placebo was investigated in a double-blind, cross-over study in 60 out-patients. The hypnotic effect, subdivided in the parameters sleep quality, latency of sleep onset and status after awaking, was scored daily by the patient after arising. The results showed that zopiclone 7.5 mg and temazepam 20 mg were almost equally effective. In sleep quality and latency of sleep onset, there appeared to be a non-significant trend favouring zopiclone. Both hypnotics differ significantly from placebo. Mood and behaviour during the day, as well as somatic symptoms and side-effects, were also scored daily and showed no significant differences between the treatments. The third week, which was a placebo week for all patients, showed a gradual improvement in sleep quality. It supports the case for not prescribing hypnotics for more than 2 weeks.", 
    "44": "We have previously reported that administration of atropine (A) to unrestrained, sedentary, heat-stressed rats resulted in a dose-dependent increase in heating rate (rate of rise of core temperature, degree C/min). Additionally, we have demonstrated that the decrements in treadmill endurance and increments in heating rate of physostigmine (PH)-treated running rats can both be restored to control levels by pretreating the animals with A and diazepam (D). Our objective in the present work was to determine if the administration of D + PH to A-treated unrestrained, sedentary, heat-stressed rats (N = 16/group, 510-530 g) could improve their thermal tolerance. The following drugs were administered singly (at 10 min intervals) via lateral tail vein: vehicle-control (C), A (200 micrograms/kg), D (500 micrograms/kg), and PH (200 micrograms/kg). After drug administration, the rats were heat-stressed (Tamb = 41.5 degrees C) until a core temperature of 42.6 degrees C was attained when they were removed to a 26 degrees C chamber. The heating rates (degrees C/min) and tolerance times (min) of the respective groups were: C- 0.02, 235; A- 0.08, 58; A D- 0.06, 94; and A + D + PH- 0.04, 143. Administration of D with A significantly decreased heating rate, and D + PH more than doubled the thermal tolerance of A-treated rats. Thus, the combination of A + D + PH not only restores PH-induced performance and thermoregulatory decrements of rats exercised in a moderate environment, but also reduces A-induced heat intolerance.", 
    "45": "A very low calorie diet (Prodi) was administered to eleven otherwise healthy obese subjects for fourteen days. The daily intake of protein was 52.7 g and carbohydrate 25.7 g, corresponding to 360 kcal. The clearance of oxazepam and antipyrine was investigated before and after the diet period. Total oxazepam clearance was 1.04 ml.min-1.kg-1 and it decreased 0.88-fold after the diet. The mean clearance of unbound oxazepam was correspondingly reduced 0.88-fold. The elimination half-life increased to 1.22-times the control value, 7.9 h. No significant change was found in the volume of distribution or protein binding of oxazepam. Antipyrine clearance, estimated by the one-sample technique, was 52.4 and 51.8 ml.min-1, before and after the diet, respectively. It appears that a very low calorie diet with a sufficient protein and a very low carbohydrate content decreases the metabolism of oxazepam by glucuro-conjugation, whereas no effect was seen on the oxidative metabolism of antipyrine.", 
    "46": "Nine healthy, male subjects received controlled-rate i.v. infusions of a new formulation of pirenzepine to produce constant plasma levels of 40 ng/ml and 105 ng/ml. They also received stepped infusions resulting in plasma levels of 20, 40, 80 and 40 ng/ml for defined periods. Peptone-stimulated gastric acid and volume secretion and near point vision decreased dose dependently, whereas gastric acidity was unchanged. There was a significant correlation between inhibition of gastric acid secretion and the pirenzepine concentration in plasma and in gastric juice. During the stepped i.v. infusion, changes in near point vision were closely related to the plasma drug concentration. Antimuscarinic side-effects occurred more frequently when the plasma drug level was high. Overall, there was a close relationship between the plasma concentrations and the effects and side-effects of pirenzepine. Its gastric inhibitory action was characterized only by a reduction in gastric volume secretion. Increasing plasma concentrations during the first days of treatment may be essential for its efficacy as an antiulcer drug.", 
    "47": "Full recovery of short-term memory (maximum time of delayed reactions) and of the structure of situational conditioned reflex and differentiation inhibition in dogs is observed in 1.5-2.5 h after tranquil-anaesthesia (diazepam-ketamine in doses of 0.3-15 mg/kg correspondingly) and dissociative anaesthesia by ketamine (15 mg/kg) in 6-8 h after neuroleptanalgesia (droperidol-fentanyl 2.5-0.05 mg/kg correspondingly), 20-24 h after narcosis by thiopental sodium (30 mg/kg) and by the end of the 3d day after neuroleptanaesthesia (droperidol-ketamine 2.5-15 mg/kg correspondingly). The recovery of the reaction of memory trace reproduction (of conditioned reaction of passive avoidance in rats) after various types of general anaesthesia is observed mainly in the same sequence, but on the average a day later than the short-term memory in dogs.", 
    "48": "These experiments examined the role of several variables involved in the production of serious, stress-induced disease. Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that stress may not be medically dangerous except in animals with a predisposition or vulnerability to disease. Repeated exposure to cold-immobilization produced no detectable ill effects in healthy hamsters, but it was lethal for cardiomyopathic hamsters (CMHs). Experiment 3 showed that stressor intensity was also critical to the outcome of stress. CMHs succumbed when they were stressed in the supine position, but not when they were immobilized in the less stressful prone position. In Experiment 4, we attempted to reduce the stressfulness of cold-immobilization with the anxiolytic alprazolam. Alprazolam effectively blocked stress-induced mortality. In addition, we found that poststress body temperature was a crude predictor of an animal's ability to cope with stress. Alprazolam prevented CMHs from developing stress-induced hypothermia.", 
    "49": "In the present series of experiments, effects of a full benzodiazepine receptor agonist (diazepam) are described and compared with those of a partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist (ZK 91296) and an inverse partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist (FG 7142), both compounds of the beta-carboline family. In a rat model for generalized absence epilepsy, the anticonvulsant, the hypnotic and the myorelaxant properties were investigated, as well as effects on on-going behavior and effects on the electroencephalogram (EEG). While diazepam showed all behavioral and electrophysiological changes characteristic for the benzodiazepines, the partial agonist ZK 91296 reduced seizure activity without inducing any signs of sedation, sleepiness, myorelaxation and changes in behavior or EEG spectral content. The partial inverse agonist FG 7142 aggrevated epileptic activity, with slightly enhanced immobile behavior, suggesting some anxiogenic properties. The results not only demonstrate that the multiple effects of the benzodiazepines could be separated by these compounds, but also that the anticonvulsant activity is not related to changes in spectral content of the EEG. Because of its selective activity, ZK 91296 appears to be more suitable than diazepam in reducing seizure activity. Finally, FG 7142 seems a genuine partial inverse agonist which has some, but not all, of the inverse effects of a full agonist.", 
    "50": "The reversal of anticonvulsant effect of ethanol against chemoconvulsions by RO15-4513 was investigated in rats as this novel imidazobenzodiazepine (ethyl-8 azido-5, 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-Oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5a] [1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) is reported to antagonize the acute behavioral and biochemical effects of ethanol in animals. Reversal of ethanol effects on onset of myoclonic jerks, tonic extensor phase, mortality time and percent protection against mortality were compared with not only other anticonvulsant pentobarbital but also with another inverse agonist FG-7142. Pretreatment with RO15-4513 (4 mg/kg) reversed the protective effect of ethanol against bicuculline-induced tonic extensor phase and mortality (87%). This response was sensitive to reversal by RO15-1788 (10 mg/kg). However, onset of myoclonic jerks and duration of clonus were not significantly altered. It also reversed the effect against picrotoxin but the reversal against mortality was up to 50%. As compared to ethanol, RO15-4513 reversed partially the protective effect of pentobarbital against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced convulsions. FG-7142 failed to reverse the protective effect of ethanol and pentobarbital against bicuculline-induced tonic extensor phase although it reversed the effect against onset and mortality. It had no effect on the protective effect against picrotoxin-induced convulsions. Both RO15-4513 and FG-7142 possessed proconvulsant effects against bicuculline but not against picrotoxin. These observations suggest that RO15-4513 has a more preferential action against ethanol effects as compared to the other inverse agonist.", 
    "51": "In the latent inhibition (LI) paradigm, prior nonreinforced exposure to a stimulus retards subsequent conditioning to that stimulus when it is paired with reinforcement. The development of LI reflects learning not to attend to, or ignore, stimuli which predict no significant consequences. The present experiment tested the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on LI using a conditioned emotional response (CER) procedure consisting of three stages given 24 hr apart: preexposure, in which the to-be-conditioned stimulus, tone, was presented without reinforcement; conditioning, in which the preexposed stimulus was paired with shock; and test, where LI was indexed by animals' suppression of licking during tone presentation. Preexposure and conditioning were given off-baseline. CDP (5 mg/kg) was administered only in preexposure, only in conditioning, in both stages or in neither. The administration of the drug during tone-shock conditioning conducted off-baseline markedly reduced animals' suppression to the tone in a subsequent licking test which was conducted without the drug. The administration of CDP during nonreinforced preexposure to the tone abolished the development of LI, i.e., drug-treated preexposed animals did not show reduced suppression as compared to drug-treated nonpreexposed animals. These results demonstrate that CDP: a) blocks the acquisition of classically conditioned fear and b) disrupts animals' ability to learn that stimuli predict no significant outcomes.", 
    "52": "Five human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines were screened for the presence of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs), using [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS). T3M4 and COLO-357 cells exhibited specific, high-affinity binding to mAChRs. A small amount of [3H]NMS also bound in PANCI and ASPC-I cells, but not in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Atropine, pirenzepine (PZ), and 11-[[2-[(diethylamino) methyly]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido-[2, 3-b] [1, 4] benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) inhibited [3H]NMS binding and carbachol-mediated [3H]inositol monophosphate formation in both T3M4 and COLO-357 cells. The order of inhibition was: atropine greater than PZ greater than AF-DX 116. Carbachol did not alter [3H]inositol monophosphate formation in the other cell lines. These findings suggest that the mAChRs expressed in some human pancreatic cancer cells exhibit the pharmacologic characteristics of a muscarinic receptor subtype with an intermediate affinity for PZ and a lower affinity for AF-DX 116 and are functionally coupled to activation of phospholipid hydrolysis.", 
    "53": "Characterization of muscarinic receptor subtypes on the dog pancreas in situ was examined by using specific muscarinic receptor antagonists to study pancreatic exocrine secretion. Bethanechol caused an increase in pancreatic exocrine secretion, with a high concentration of protein and little effect on bicarbonate concentration. Thus bethanechol may mainly affect the muscarinic receptors of the acinar cells. Bethanechol-stimulated secretion was inhibited by pirenzepine (a specific M1 muscarinic antagonist), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP, a specific M3 muscarinic antagonist), and atropine (a mixed muscarinic receptor antagonist). However, [11-[[2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzo-diazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116, a specific cardioselective M2 antagonist) did not have any effects on bethanechol-stimulated secretion. Increased protein secretion in pancreatic juice stimulated by bethanechol was significantly inhibited by 4-DAMP and atropine and was suppressed by pirenzepine, but was not modified by AF-DX 116. Bicarbonate concentration was not modified by these antagonists. 4-DAMP, atropine, and pirenzepine caused a progressive parallel rightward shift in the dose-response curve of pancreatic secretion for bethanechol. Schild analysis of the data indicated a pA2 value of 8.7 for 4-DAMP, 7.9 for atropine, and 6.2 for pirenzepine, respectively. Thus 4-DAMP has 7.5 times and 440 times greater potency than atropine and pirenzepine to inhibit bethanechol-stimulated secretion. The slope of the Schild regression line was not different from 1. These results suggest that inhibitions of bethanechol-stimulated pancreatic secretion are competitive for 4-DAMP, atropine, and pirenzepine and that bethanechol-stimulated pancreatic secretion is mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors in dogs.", 
    "54": "Peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites were characterized in porcine aortic smooth muscle membrane preparation. [3H]PK11195 bound with high affinity to the membranes (Kd = 8.6 + 0.9 nM), whereas [3H]Ro5-4864 bound slightly to the membranes. The Ki value of Ro5-4864 obtained from the inhibition of [3H]PK 11195 binding was 1200 + 200 nM, which was 480 times weaker than that obtained in rat kidney. Furthermore, the Ro5-4864 effect was temperature-insensitive. When [3H]PK 11195 binding was examined in porcine, human and rat platelets, Ro5-4864 inhibited the binding in porcine and human platelets one order of magnitude less potently than that in rat platelets. These results suggest that low affinity for Ro5-4864 in porcine aorta smooth muscle originates in porcine tissue, but not in smooth muscle.", 
    "55": "Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent with a high emetic potential; it can lead to hypomagnesemia, which is caused by a renal wasting. Because of beneficial effects of magnesium in the therapy of motor disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract and its sedative, anticonvulsive effect in eclampsia, we tested parenteral magnesium sulfate as a potential antiemetic in patients receiving cisplatin. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was carried out in 20 patients receiving greater than or equal to 60 mg/m2 cisplatin. A standard antiemetic regimen consisting of a single dose of 10 mg diazepam and five times 0.5 mg/kg metoclopramide (every 2 h) was used. Simultaneously, 8 g magnesium sulfate or isotonic sodium chloride was infused over 4.5 h. The efficacy of magnesium was analyzed with an emetic score system; no difference was found between magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride. Only two patients were hypomagnesemic, and they had a better emetic score with the magnesium infusion. We conclude that the i.v. administration of magnesium during cisplatin therapy has no antiemetic effect, at least in normomagnesemic patients.", 
    "56": "Rats were given atropine for 2 weeks and a cholinesterase inhibitor, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) for 4 weeks. The secretory response of the submaxillary glands to pilocarpine and the muscarinic receptor binding to [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) and [3H]pirenzepine (PZ) in the submaxillary glands were investigated. Experiments were performed 48 and 24 hr after the last administration of atropine and DFP, respectively. Chronic atropine treatment enhanced the secretory response and increased the number of binding sites for [3H]QNB and [3H]PZ. The increase in number of binding sites for the 2 radioligands was almost the same. Chronic DFP treatment caused a marked decrease in the secretory response to pilocarpine, without affecting [3H]PZ and [3H]QNB binding. These results suggest that the cholinergic muscarinic M1 receptors may contribute to the development of the supersensitivity of the salivary glands caused by atropine, but not to the development of subsensitivity caused by DFP.",

The behavioral excitation appears similar to that observed following the administration of beta-carboline esters--agents reported to interact with benzodiazepine receptors and termed \"inverse agonists.\" The focus of the present study is to correlate the occurrence of changes in CS with behavioral excitation previously observed by others. Further, these studies are designed to show a parallel between the manifestations of benzodiazepine withdrawal and the pharmacologic effects of beta-carboline ethyl ester. Experiments were done in conscious unrestrained male Sprague-Dawley rats, with chronic i.v. catheters, using sound-attenuated one-way vision boxes. These studies compared the hormonal and behavioral changes induced by beta-carboline ethyl ester (beta CCE) with CGS-8216-precipitated withdrawal in rats treated with diazepam for 8 days. Rats treated chronically with diazepam (5 mg/kg/day), showed a significant increase in plasma (CS) following CGS-8216. Behavioral abstinence scores were also significantly elevated. beta CCE (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) showed a significant dose-related increase in plasma CS. Behavioral scores were also increased at doses of 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg. beta CCE-induced plasma CS increases were antagonized by CGS-8216 at doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg but not by 0.5 mg/kg. In animals chronically treated with diazepam, beta CCE evoked a more prolonged plasma CS elevation than in vehicle-treated animals suggesting a dual agonist/antagonist effect. These data suggest a parallel between CS elevations and behavioral effects during withdrawal as well as similarities between the action of beta CCE and the manifestations of this withdrawal.", 
    "59": "The pharmacodynamic potency of oral midazolam, a new ultrashort-acting hypnotic benzodiazepine, has been evaluated relative to a standard dose of triazolam, a well established oral benzodiazepine with a similar pharmacological profile. In a balanced design, double-blind cross-over study 6 healthy volunteers received 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg midazolam and 0.25 mg triazolam orally, at 8 a.m., at weekly intervals. Drug effects were repeatedly measured over 8 h by a new psychometric method, the threshold amplitude for perception of flickering light (TPF) assessed at 5 and 30 Hz. Auditory reaction time, digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), and self-rating by subjects served as reference standards. Median midazolam doses equivalent to 0.25 mg triazolam, interpolated on dose-response curves for peak effects, were 5.2 mg (TPF 30 Hz), 6.4 mg (TPF 5 Hz), 6.5 mg (DSST), and 7.4 mg (reaction time), respectively. Alternative methods of data analysis gave similar results. Introduction of TPF as a highly reproducible and sensitive measure of the effect of benzodiazepines on the CNS offers new opportunities to compare the relative potencies of different benzodiazepines in man. Since clinical experience has shown 0.25 mg triazolam to be safe and effective, it is concluded that the corresponding single oral dose of midazolam is between 5 and 8 mg.", 
    "60": "As deafness surgery is subject to the two imperatives of safety and reduction of bleeding, local anaesthesia constitutes a very satisfactory solution. The concomitant administration of Midazolam and Buprenorphine relaxes the patient and ensures analgesia and anterograde amnesia, allowing the surgeon to operate under excellent conditions. Over the last 6 months, except in one subject under the age of 16 years and one psychologically very fragile patient, all surgical operations for deafness, regardless of their importance, have been performed under local anaesthesia improved by means of diazanalgesia. It is probable that in the future, numerous cophosurgeons will adopt a similar protocol.", 
    "61": "Our aim was to determine the effects of pharmacological sedation on oral breathing induced by nasal obstruction in chronically prepared newborn and mature sheep. Nasal obstruction (5 min) was achieved by blocking tubes temporarily fixed into the nostrils. We continuously recorded EMG activity of the diaphragm, genioglossus and digastric muscles, intrapleural pressure and percent O2 saturation in arterial blood (SaO2). Blood samples were taken intermittently and analysed for SaO2, P02, PCO2 and pH. As previously reported, nasal obstruction in lambs and ewes led to asphyxial changes in blood gases and pH; lambs were affected more than ewes. Respiratory responses to nasal obstruction were retested after administration of pentobarbitone Na (5 and 10 mg/kg), diazepam (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) and alcohol (nominally 0.075 and 0.11% of blood w/v). Pentobarbitone and diazepam, both of which produced sedation, delayed the onset of oral breathing and led to a greater degree of asphyxia during nasal obstruction. EMG activities in the genioglossus and digastric muscles were inhibited by the drugs, whereas the depth of inspiratory efforts was not. Alcohol had no apparent sedative effect, nor did it significantly affect responses to nasal occlusion. We conclude that sedating doses of pentobarbitone and diazepam depress the effectiveness of oral breathing when the nose is blocked, probably owing to their inhibitory effects on activation of muscles maintaining patency of an oral airway.", 
    "62": "An oral combination of cinnarizine and lorazepam was studied for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting induced by strongly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. 56% of 59 chemotherapy courses in 29 patients were completed without emesis. Of the 42 cisplatin-containing regimens, 52% were without vomiting and 62% free of nausea. A further 11 patients (17 courses) received non-cisplatin emetogenic chemotherapy. In this group full emetic control was achieved in 65% of the courses. Diarrhea in 4% of the courses was the only side effect of this new oral combination.", 
    "63": "The kinetics of ethyl loflazepate were studied in patients with various degrees of renal failure. A strong correlation was noted between urinary excretion of metabolite loflazepate and creatinine clearance. In contrast, elimination half-life and total plasma clearance of the sum of loflazepate + descarboxyloflazepate seemed to be independent of the degree of renal impairment. These results indicate the absence of a risk of accumulation of the 2 main and active metabolites of ethyl loflazepate in patients with renal failure.", 
    "64": "1. To determine how the GABAergic mechanism operates in the generation of post-rotatory nystagmus, an experiment was performed with GABAergic drugs in rabbits. 2. Subconvulsive doses of picrotoxin (0.3-0.6 mg/kg, i.v.) and bicuculline (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased the number of post-rotatory nystagmus beats, whereas strychnine sulphate, at a subconvulsive dose (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), increased it. 3. Diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.v.) remarkably increased the number of post-rotatory nystagmus beats. Pretreatment with picrotoxin (0.45 mg/kg, i.v.), bicuculline (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) or semicarbazide-HCl (180 mg/kg, i.v.) antagonized the effects of diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.v.). 4. GABAergic mechanisms may play a modulatory role in the production of nystagmus rhythm. Strychnine-sensitive neurons involved in the vestibular mechanism may behave in a different manner from picrotoxin-sensitive neurons.", 
    "65": "The interactions that exist between benzodiazepines and surfactants provide micellar enhancement factors for their fluorimetric determination in the range 1.2-6.5, depending on the nature of both the benzodiazepine and the surfactant. A series of benzodiazepines and anionic surfactants were treated topologically to determine the influence of each benzodiazepine substituent on the basic benzodiazepine structure and the influence of both the hydrophobic moiety of the surfactant and its counter ion on the sensitisation process. Sensitisation parameters were used to quantify the effect of the chemical structures of both surfactants and drugs on their interaction.", 
    "66": "Chlordiazepoxide 40mg daily was used to prevent delerium tremens in a 64-year-old female with alcoholic liver disease. After 20 days, the drug was stopped because of the onset of progressive drowsiness. The kinetics of chloridazepoxide were within the predicted range for patients with liver disease, but the elimination half-lives of desmethylchlordiazepoxide and demoxepam were greatly prolonged at 346 hours and 150 hours, respectively. It is suggested that metabolite accumulation may have contributed to the coma, which is an unusual reaction to chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "67": "Unknown compounds that were not amenable to GC/MS were found during routine benzodiazepine HPLC screening in a postmortem case. The apparent thermolability made the application of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry mandatory. The moving-belt interface was used because of its value for identification based on the use of both electron impact and chemical ionization, which provided information on both structure and molecular weight. The herbicide diuron and four of its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine and had a total concentration as high as 100 mg/L. Metabolism via demethylation and hydroxylation appeared to be the major routes.", 
    "68": "Several studies suggest that GABAergic mechanisms may be involved in the modulation of melatonin secretion. However, conflicting results have been reported in animal studies; in humans the issue has not been widely investigated. In the present study, using a double-blind design, six healthy men received orally, at midnight, 10 mg of diazepam, a GABAergic agent, or placebo, on two different occasions 1 week apart. Blood samples were collected, in the dark, immediately before the drug administration, and at 12:30, 1, 2, 3, and 4 AM. Serum melatonin was measured by a radioimmunological method with [125I]melatonin as a tracer. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements disclosed a significant effect for treatment (P less than 0.01), for time (P less than 0.0004), and for treatment X time interaction (P less than 0.05). Following diazepam administration, serum melatonin levels observed at 2, 3, and 4 AM were significantly lower than the corresponding values following placebo (P less than 0.002 at 2 and 4 AM; P less than 0.03 at 3 AM [Students' paired t test]). These results show that nocturnal blood melatonin levels may be suppressed by the acute administration of a GABAergic agent, suggesting that GABA may be involved in the modulation of pineal activity in man.", 
    "69": "Several data suggest that muscarinic M-1 receptors are located on airway smooth muscle of human beings and dogs. Muscarinic M-1 receptors, whose stimulation is associated with enhancement of acetylcholine release, may also be located in the airway parasympathetic ganglia. To determine if postsynaptic muscarinic M-1 receptors mediate airway constriction, the action was compared of pirenzepine, that antagonizes selectively muscarinic M-1 receptors, and atropine, that blocks both muscarinic M-1 and M-2 receptors, on bronchial responses to methacholine inhalation in seven asthmatic patients. Pirenzepine and atropine gave protection against methacholine; however, the degree of protection by pirenzepine was significantly less than that given by atropine. Some inhibitory effect was obtained in all the patients studied after pirenzepine administration, even though some patients were only slight responders. The significant finding of the study is that pirenzepine partially inhibits the bronchospastic response to methacholine. This result suggests that muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle are also of the M-1 subtype.", 
    "70": "Since there have been only a few studies on muscarinic receptor subtypes in airway smooth muscle, the effect was investigated of pirenzepine on airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the functional responses compared from these patients with those from healthy subjects. Our data demonstrated that the therapy with pirenzepine significantly improved ventilatory function in patients with COPD. The data also suggested that this drug exerts its action on small airways, but not larger airways in normal subjects. It is possible that in healthy human beings pirenzepine produces mild bronchodilation by means of a vagal efferent blockade, while in patients with COPD, it may be effective because it not only decreases the activity of the vagal efferent pathway, but also decreases the sensitivity of vagal sensory endings and causes a vagal afferent blockade.", 
    "71": "Non-esterified fatty acids have been shown to displace diazepam from its plasma binding sites both in vitro and in vivo. However, the binding of other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam is not affected in similar situations. Flunitrazepam exhibits a substantial degree of binding to plasma proteins, therefore it was deemed interesting to investigate the role of free fatty acids on flunitrazepam binding to human plasma proteins. Incubation of plasma with sodium oleate (1.5 and 3.0 microEq per ml) produced a decrease in the binding of flunitrazepam. The free fraction increased from 4.20 +/- 0.34 to 6.30 +/- 0.53 and to 22.18 +/- 1.28% respectively). Sodium heparin administration (10IU/kg, intravenously) increased free fatty acids levels and produced similar changes in the binding of flunitrazepam. After ten minutes of heparin administration free fatty acids increased from 0.16 +/- 0.03 mEq/l to 0.34 +/- 0.01 mEq/l and the free fraction of flunitrazepam in plasma increased from 3.70 +/- 0.22% to 6.20 +/- 1.24%. These binding data further support a relationship between increases in the concentrations of free fatty acids and decreases in the fraction of flunitrazepam bound to plasma proteins.", 
    "72": "1. The effects of some centrally acting muscle relaxants on the post-rotatory nystagmus induced by rotatory stimulation were investigated in the rabbit, to examine the action of the drugs on vestibular function. 2. Tolperisone-HCl (5-10 mg/kg, i.v.) and baclofen (1-3 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased the number of post-rotatory nystagmus beats dose-dependently, whereas mephenesin (40-80 mg/kg, i.v.) and diazepam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) prolonged it dose-dependently. 3. The inhibitory effects of tolperisone-HCl and baclofen may provide some suggestions as to the mechanisms and sites of actions of centrally acting muscle relaxants, while the significance of the prolonging action of mephenesin remains unclear. 4. The prolonging action of diazepam is discussed with reference to GABAergic mechanisms.", 
    "73": "The maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values for [3H]PK 11195 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites were measured in the platelets of subjects immediately after examination stress and 10 days later, as well as in unstressed controls. Increased (52%; p less than 0.05) Bmax, but unaltered KD, values were observed immediately after the stress as compared to the controls. Ten days after the stress, a slight decrease (15%) in the number of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites was observed, but their values remained higher (29%) in comparison to unstressed controls. Levels of plasma stress hormones (cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin) did not differ in the stressed subjects from those of the controls.", 
    "74": "Malignant neuroleptic syndrome (MNS) together with agranulocytosis represents a relatively rare but the most difficult idiosyncratic reaction to the therapy with neuroleptics. The most prominent symptoms are as follows: hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, vegetative dysfunction and disturbance in consciousness. MNS usually occurs unexpectedly and unpredictably during the first days of the treatment with neuroleptics and most frequently it takes a remarkably rapid course. About 15-20% of the cases are lethal. The aim of the successful treatment is the early recognition of MNS preferably in the prodromal phases which can by the employment of adequate therapy interfere the evolution into the full clinical picture, i.e. to the lethal outcome. Efficient therapy includes: 1) interruption in the administration of neuroleptics, 2) regulation of water disbalance and electrolyte metabolism, 3) application of drugs which activate dopaminergine transmission insufficiency (bromocriptine, predominantly) or other disturbances induced by it in other neuronal systems which is obtained by the administration of anticholinergic antiparkinsonics and benzodiazepines (GABA effect), and 4) electroconvulsion. All aspects of MNS from the standpoint of actual level of knowledge are presented in this paper. The authors' own experience with the nine MNS cases registered at their clinic is also set forth. By the improvement in diagnostic and therapy no death due to MNS has been observed over the last few years.", 
    "75": "The effects of oral buspirone (BUS, 10 mg) and diazepam (DZP, 10 mg) were studied in 12 healthy women volunteers using subjective ratings, objective tests of psychomotor and cognitive functions and urinary dosage of catecholamine output. Drugs were randomly administered to the same subjects, in a crossover, double-blind study, each drug administration being separated by at least 1 week. BUS subjective effects were less severe than those of DZP and not accompanied by feelings of sleepiness that characterized DZP sedative effects. Furthermore, BUS did not impair psychomotor functioning while DZP induced both an impairment of central sensory processing and, to a lesser extent, an impairment in delayed memory.", 
    "76": "Positron emission tomography (PET) enables the study of neuropharmacological variables, such as regional receptor densities, alterations in receptor occupancy from endogenous neurotransmitters and exogenous drugs, and receptor plasticity in living human subjects. The purpose of this paper is to review the procedures currently used to study brain pharmacology based on the use of radioactive tracers and PET, and to identify open issues in this field. In particular, the article reviews methodology for tracer validation, including essential biochemistry and kinetic modeling, as well as present clinical applications of tracers used to study dopamine, opioid, benzodiazepine, and cholinergic receptors.", 
    "77": "In expectation of improving sensitivity, the standard 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was given to 10 depressed inpatients and repeated with theophylline or caffeine and again following 3 days of lorazepam with abrupt discontinuation. Two patients showed nonsuppression on the standard DST; 2 suppressors changed to nonsuppression after lorazepam discontinuation, and 1 also changed after theophylline. This increase from 20 to 40% sensitivity remains significantly less than a desirable minimum 80% sensitivity (p less than 0.001), which suggests that a consistent DST sensitivity of 80% in melancholia is unlikely to be attained.", 
    "78": "1. We evaluated the feasibility of using a simulated public speaking (SPS) test to assess the activity of anxiolytic drugs. SPS was achieved by requesting subjects to present a speech to an audiocassette recorder. Thirty volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups treated with 10 mg diazepam, 10 mg buspirone or placebo, under double-blind conditions. One h after drug administration, subjective states were measured by the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and by a Bodily Symptoms Scale (BSS). Heart rate and blood pressure were also recorded. 2. SPS induced both physiological and subjective changes characteristic of anxiety. Moreover, diazepam attenuated experimentally induced increases in excitement (as measured by VAMS) and agitation (as measured by BSS). Therefore, SPS using an audiocassette recorder is sensitive to a prototypical anxiolytic and may thus be a useful test for evaluating putative anxiolytics. 3. No effect was observed with the new anxiolytic drug buspirone. However, the present negative result may be explained by clinical data indicating that patients may experience a longer lag period before the onset of the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.", 
    "79": "PABA-serum and urine-concentration were studied in patients with normal, pathologic and pharmacologically inhibited pancreatic function. Secretin-pancreozymine test was selected as reference method. In patients with normal pancreas function and volunteers, PABA-serum-concentration was characterized by a rapid increase during the first 1 1/2 hours. A maximum increase of 32.42 +/- 10.04 mumol/l was reached after 90 minutes. In patients with exocrine pancrease insufficiency, difference to the control group was greatest after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Pharmacologic inhibition of the exocrine pancreas using pirenzepine also resulted in a significantly reduced PABA-serum-concentration after 30, 60 and 90 min. In correspondence to the delayed and smaller serum PABA increase, urine-PABA-concentrations were also diminished. Our results indicate that the optimal interval to differentiate between normal and impaired pancreas function with use of serum PABA determination is at 90 min after test begin.", 
    "80": "Death from malignant hyperthermia (MH) still occurs in France. However, anaesthesia of the MH susceptible (MhS) patient is quite possible without any more risk than for patients who are not MhS. Guidelines have been worked out: \"trigger\" drugs such as volatile anaesthetics (halothane, enflurane, isoflurane) and depolarizing muscle relaxants must be imperatively avoided; \"non-trigger\" drugs should be used, such as nitrous oxide, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, propofol, opiates, non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, amide or ester local anaesthetics at the usual doses without adrenaline. Moreover, dantrolene should be available in all hospitals, 12 bottles being a minimum at hand, or, better, 30 (about 10 mg.kg-1). In some cases, such as emergencies, an unprepared operating theatre, or an unprepared ventilator, the patient should be premedicated with 2.5 mg.kg-1 dantrolene intravenously. The ventilator, the circuit and the operating theatre should not contain any trace of halogenated vapour. The usual parameters, as well as temperature and expired CO2 concentration, should be closely monitored. MhS patients must also be given counselling. This includes explanations about MH, its genetic features, the main laboratory tests used to detect susceptibility, as well as advice about lifestyle, the use of drugs other than general and local anaesthetics, and a discussion concerning the association of MH with other diseases. This counselling is not always easy to provide, because many answers are not, as yet, definitive.", 
    "81": "A general overview upon most used products in odontopediatrics is presented; the factors which influence the determination of the adequate doses in children and some useful recommendations in dental clinical practice are described. The most prescribed products in pediatric odontology are summarized into two groups: a) benzodiazepine, for anxiety and lidocaine, aspirin and acetaminophen, dipirone and naproxen, for pain; and b) penicillin, erythromycin, for treatment of infections. Doses, pharmacologic effects, clinical indications, side effects and contraindications of the chemicals mentioned are described. Also, the article presents some of the aspects which justify the use, in our country, of certain medicaments prescribed in other nations reporting, the recommendations in order to prevent the use of other chemicals because of their lack of therapeutical advantages over the ones of first choice.", 
    "82": "Mice who were exposed to phenobarbital prenatally (B mice) had at adulthood deficits in the hippocampal eight-arm maze, spontaneous alternations, and water maze behaviors. Morphological studies revealed neuronal losses in the hippocampus. The surviving neurons had reductions from control in the number of dendritic branches, area and spine density, but wider fission angle than control. Neurochemical studies on the hippocampus revealed the following alterations: (a) decrease in NE level and the number of the NE cell bodies (b) no change in the serotonergic system (c) an increase in muscarinic receptors Bmax in the hippocampus; (d) no changes in GABA and benzodiazepine receptors. However, neonatal phenobarbital exposure caused an increase in the Bmax of GABA and benzodiazepine receptors. Transplantation of fetal septal cholinergic neurons into the hippocampus of B mice reversed most of the deficits in eight-arm maze behavior, while transplantation of noradrenergic cells did not affect the performance of B mice. In further studies on cholinergic mechanisms, the dopaminergic innervations in the septum (originating from A10), which are known to indirectly inhibit the activity of the septohippocampal cholinergic pathways, were destroyed by 6-OHDA. B mice treated with 6-OHDA had an increase in hippocampal ChAT activity and improved their eight-arm maze performance. Thus, understanding of the mechanism of a particular behavioral deficit enables one to correct it despite the nonspecific action of the neuroteratogen.", 
    "83": "A prospective study was carried out in 20 selected subjects undergoing ENT endoscopy, with spontaneous ventilation of room air after premedication with midazolam IM 1.5 kg-10 [corrected] and then sedation with 0.07 mg.kg-1 IV and dextromoramide 0.03 mg.kg-1 IV and local anesthesia. The procedure was satisfactorily completed in the 20 cases; alertness was preserved in the 20 cases; total amnesia for the procedure was obtained in 19 cases. There were significant alterations in systolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate but these remained within strictly physiological limits. Blood gas results were similarly affected but at the limit of normal in 6 cases after 30 minutes of the procedure. Cardiovascular tolerance was excellent but close surveillance of the sedative effects on ventilation was required. Provided these conditions are respected, midazolam would appear to be of particular interest in ENT endoscopy.", 
    "84": "In a double-blind multicentre trial to study the effect of pirenzepine in the treatment of non-ulcer dyspepsia, 104 of 128 patients, 52 in each of the study and control groups, completed the 4 weeks of the investigation. There was improvement of the endoscopic and clinical findings but no change of the degree of the mucosal inflammation or the extent of colonisation by campylobacter pylori. The mode of action of pirenzepine in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia associated with campylobacter related gastroduodenitis remains obscure. Further studies are needed to investigate the possibility of a causal relationship between mucosal colonisation with campylobacter pylori and gastroduodenitis specially in cases of non-ulcer dyspepsia.", 
    "85": "A double-blind study was carried out in 30 female patients with generalized anxiety disorders associated with depressive symptoms to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of etizolam and alprazolam. Patients were allocated at random to receive one or other drug at a dosage of 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 weeks. Assessments were made on entry and after 3 and 5 weeks of treatment using the Hamilton rating scales for anxiety and for depression. The results showed that both drugs had marked anxiolytic and antidepressive activity, there being significant reductions after treatment in mean total rating scores compared to baseline. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the two drugs, there was a trend for etizolam to be more effective in relieving anxiety somatization symptoms. Apart from moderate daytime drowsiness in a few patients, both drugs were considered to be extremely well tolerated."
