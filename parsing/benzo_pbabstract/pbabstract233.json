    "0": "As many as 30% of individuals diagnosed with depression are nonresponsive to traditional antidepressant medication. Augmentation and combination strategies have emerged in an attempt to address this issue. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine), when added to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine) have shown great promise in the treatment of these treatment-resistant patients. As of yet, the precise neural mechanisms responsible for the beneficial clinical effect of these combinations are not completely understood.", 
    "1": "Separate groups of rats received either saline or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) for 24 hours or 3 weeks via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. The effects of either intravenous saline or olanzapine (.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg) on locus coeruleus (LC) neuronal activity were then assessed via extracellular single-unit recordings.", 
    "2": "Acute administration of olanzapine produced a significant elevation of the firing rate and burst firing of LC cells, and chronic, but not acute, administration of fluoxetine decreased baseline and burst firing of LC cells; however, when given in combination, an interaction of fluoxetine and olanzapine was observed, with olanzapine causing a significantly greater increase in LC firing rate and burst firing after acute and chronic administration of fluoxetine.", 
    "3": "These results provide a potential neural mechanism for the beneficial clinical effects of the olanzapine/fluoxetine combination. The increase in baseline and burst firing of LC neurons in the groups receiving both fluoxetine and olanzapine would result in enhanced norepinephrine release in projection areas (e.g., prefrontal cortex), which could lead to a reduction in depressive symptoms.", 
    "4": "The combination of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (OLA) appears to be more effective for the treatment of resistant depression than single drugs. We hypothesize that such combination may determine a specific modulation of neuroplastic genes, which could contribute to therapeutic activity.", 
    "5": "We investigated the expression of the neurotrophic molecule basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) after acute or chronic administration of FLX and OLA, alone or in combination. Ribonuclease (RNase) protection assay and Western blot analysis were employed to determine FGF-2 expression in different brain structures and to identify the intracellular pathways possibly involved in FGF-2 modulation.", 
    "6": "After single injection, we found that FGF-2 mRNA levels were selectively upregulated in the prefrontal cortex only when the two drugs were coadministered, an effect paralleled by a significant increase of phosphorylated protein kinase B (P-Akt) levels. Conversely, chronic treatment with a combination of FLX and OLA (FLX+OLA) increased FGF-2 mRNA levels in prefrontal cortex, as well as in hippocampus and striatum.", 
    "7": "Based on these data, we hypothesize a role of endogenously synthesized FGF-2 in the effects of FLX/OLA combination on brain function and plasticity, which could contribute to its superior efficacy for the treatment of resistant depression.", 
    "8": "Sedation and analgesia can be routinely prescribed in head injury patients. The goals of such sedation are three: brain protection, prevention and treatment of intracranial hypertension and therapeutic facilitation. In such situation, the use of sedative and analgesic therapy should respect the rate of cerebral blood flow/cerebral oxygen consumption coupling while preserving cerebral perfusion pressure and decreasing the intracranial pressure. This treatment should have an analgesic and myorelaxing action with short and predictable time of action. The ideal sedation agent with all these properties does not exist. Only the combination of several different pharmacological classes of compounds may reach this goal. Benzodiazepines are the most frequently used agents. In most of the cases they are associated with analgesic agents such as opioid or ketamine. Opioids may be the basic analgesic agents because they do not produce brain haemodynamic modifications if arterial pressure is maintained. Among them, sufentanil, thanks to its pharmacokinetics properties, remains the most prescribed opioid. However, in the future, remifentanil that presents a fast elimination may be more frequently used for neurological follow up of patients. Ketamine whose use is subject of debate, has the main advantage of maintaining haemodynamic status. Ketamine has no side effects on brain haemodynamic when used with propofol or midazolam. Taking into account their deleting effect on haemodynamic status and immune system, barbituric are no longer used as long term sedative agents. However, their use is still recommended in the cases of refractory intracranial hypertension. Propofol remains the ideal sedative agent because of its short duration action but its use is limited by its cost. Its use may be recommended for short time sedations with or without an opioid drug. The curare use should be restrain to refractory intracranial hypertension to usual treatments and happening during stimulation.", 
    "9": "Systemic administration of nicotine suppresses food intake. Since gastric vagal afferents convey satiation signals to the hypothalamus in response to cholecystokinin, we investigated the possibility that nicotine increases afferent activity of the gastric vagal nerves by stimulating release of cholecystokinin. Furthermore, involvement of prostaglandins in the responses of gastric vagal afferents to nicotine was also investigated because prostaglandins stimulate gastric vagal afferent activity. Experiments were performed in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intravenous administration of 300 microg/kg but not 3 or 30 microg/kg nicotine produced biphasic increases in afferent activity. The maximum of the first increase was reached within 1 min, while that of the second increase was reached 10-15 min after nicotine injection. Pretreatment with MK-329, a type A cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the first increase, without influencing the second increase. Pretreatment with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, further reduced the first increase and abolished the second increase. These results suggest that nicotine can exert its anorexic effect via an increase in gastric vagal afferent activity which is caused by enhanced release of both cholecystokinin and prostaglandins.", 
    "10": "The inhibitory tone maintained throughout the central nervous system relies predominantly on the activity of neuronal GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors. This receptor family comprises various subtypes that have unique regional distributions, but little is known about the role played by each subtype. The majority of the receptors contain a gamma2 subunit and are sensitive to modulation by BZs (benzodiazepines), but differ with regard to alpha and beta subunits. Mutagenesis studies combined with molecular modelling have enabled a greater understanding of receptor structure and dynamics. This can now be extended to in vivo activity through translation to genetically modified mice containing these mutations. Ideally, the mutation should leave normal receptor function intact, and this is the case with mutations affecting the BZ-binding site of the GABAA receptor. We have generated mutations, which affect the BZ site of different alpha subunits, to enable discrimination of the various behavioural consequences of BZ drug action. This has aided our understanding of the roles played by individual GABAA receptor subtypes in particular behaviours. We have also used this technique to explore the role of different beta subunits in conferring the anaesthetic activity of etomidate. This technique together with the development of subtype-selective compounds facilitates our understanding of the roles played by each receptor subtype.", 
    "11": "Preservation of the ability to think clearly, in comfort, is a goal of end-of-life care. Recent research on delirium at the end of life suggests clinical strategies for prevention of cognitive impairment. Clinicians should consider early warnings of mild delirium such as impairment in attention and short-term memory by following the patient's ability to remember 3 words or to attend to digit span before the patient is disoriented. If cognitive impairment is noted, clinicians should pay attention to reversible causes. This article reviews clinical concerns about opiates, benzodiazepines, steroids, hepatic encephalopathy, timely use of neuroleptic medications, and caretaking strategies at home.", 
    "12": "There has been very limited information on the capacities of tropical fruits to inhibit human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity. Thus, the inhibitory effects of tropical fruits on midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity of CYP3A in human liver microsomes were evaluated. Eight tropical fruits such as common papaw, dragon fruit, kiwi fruit, mango, passion fruit, pomegranate, rambutan, and star fruit were tested. We also examined the inhibition of CYP3A activity by grapefruit (white) and Valencia orange as controls. The juice of star fruit showed the most potent inhibition of CYP3A. The addition of a star fruit juice (5.0%, v/v) resulted in the almost complete inhibition of midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity (residual activity of 0.1%). In the case of grape-fruit, the residual activity was 14.7%. The inhibition depended on the amount of fruit juice added to the incubation mixture (0.2-6.0%, v/v). The elongation of the preincubation period of a juice from star fruit (1.25 or 2.5%, v/v) with the microsomal fraction did not alter the CYP3A inhibition, suggesting that the star fruit did not contain a mechanism-based inhibitor. Thus, we discovered filtered extracts of star fruit juice to be inhibitors of human CYP3A activity in vitro.", 
    "13": "Prolonged use of opioids and benzodiazepines for the care of critically ill infants and children can generate physical dependence. We present a case of an 8-mo-old infant with Hunter's syndrome who was maintained on very large doses of fentanyl and midazolam and who could not be weaned from these drugs by conventional taper. We used dexmedetomidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, to facilitate opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal. A processed electroencephalogram (Bispectral Index) was used to guide the titration of dexmedetomidine in this neurologically impaired infant. This is the first report of this drug being used in an infant to manage chemical dependence withdrawal.",

    "15": "Early preclinical work demonstrated the potential role of spinal benzodiazepine pharmacology in regulating spinal nociceptive transmission. We review this preclinical activity and the evolving implementation of intrathecal midazolam in humans for pain management. Important elements in this development for use in humans are issues pertinent to safety and the preclinical reports that have increased our understanding of intrathecal midazolam toxicity. We seek to emphasize the time course of these studies and how they merged to provide enabling data that drove the clinical implementation. In the case of midazolam, we point to the potential issues that arose when preclinical safety data were unreasonably ignored and how consideration of preclinical safety data can serve to facilitate drug development by demonstrating reasonable safety profiles that document the minimal degree of potential risk to the patient. Issues that are of continuing relevance to the use of intrathecal midazolam, including issues of formulation and kinetics, are considered.", 
    "16": "The intrathecal use of midazolam has evolved over 20 years though a combination of preclinical and clinical investigations. We review the time course of this development to define critical elements that should be pursued in reducing the risk associated with the clinical use of a novel spinal drug.", 
    "17": "We investigated the safety of midazolam administered by continuous intrathecal infusion in relevant animal models. Preservative-free midazolam was delivered to sheep and pigs by using implanted infusion systems (SynchroMed pumps plus silicone catheters). Sheep received midazolam 5 mg/d (n = 4) or 15 mg/d (n = 7) or saline (n = 2) for 43 days at 125 micro L/h. One sheep received 10 mg/d. Infusion concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 2.5 mg/mL (5 mg/d) and from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/mL (15 mg/d). Pigs were evaluated for toxicity only and received 15 mg/d (n = 2) or saline (n = 1) for 43 days at 125 micro L/h. Behavior, neurologic function, and vital signs were documented. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid chemistry and cytology were evaluated, and histology was performed on spinal cord tissue. Behavior and neurologic function remained normal in all subjects. Gross and microscopic evaluation of spinal tissue revealed mild inflammation surrounding the catheter tract in both the midazolam-treated and the saline-treated groups. This inflammation was likely attributable to the mechanical presence of the catheter. These data demonstrate that continuous intrathecal infusion of preservative-free midazolam at doses up to 15 mg/d were well tolerated.", 
    "18": "We investigated the toxicity of preservative-free intrathecal midazolam delivered continuously via implanted infusion systems in sheep and pigs. Doses of 5-15 mg/d were well tolerated. The lack of neurotoxicity observed suggests that intrathecal midazolam may be an alternative for the treatment of intractable pain that is unresponsive to opioids.", 
    "19": "Recent investigations have sought to improve intrathecal analgesia by combining opioids with other classes of analgesics. In this study we assessed the ability of intrathecal midazolam to increase the potency and duration of the analgesic effects of intrathecal fentanyl without causing adverse effects. Thirty parturients with cervical dilations 2-6 cm were randomized to receive either intrathecal midazolam 2 mg, fentanyl 10 micro g, or both combined to initiate analgesia. Pain scores were recorded before and at 5-min intervals for 30 min after the injection and then every 30 minutes until the patient requested further analgesia. The presence and severity of nausea, emesis, pruritus, headache, and sedation, in addition to arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, sensory changes to ice, motor impairment, cardiotocograph, and Apgar score were also recorded. The parturients were assessed after 2 days and 1 mo for neurologic impairment. Preinjection pain scores were unaltered by intrathecal midazolam alone and moderately decreased by fentanyl. Intrathecal midazolam increased the analgesic effect of fentanyl. No treatment altered cardiorespiratory variables or caused motor impairment. The addition of intrathecal midazolam to fentanyl did not increase the occurrence of any maternal adverse event or abnormalities on the cardiotocograph. We conclude that intrathecal midazolam enhanced the analgesic effect of fentanyl without increasing maternal or fetal adverse effects.", 
    "20": "Treatment of labor pain with epidural injections of local anesthetic is complicated by decreases in arterial blood pressure and leg weakness. This study showed that a mixture of two drugs, fentanyl and midazolam, could provide powerful pain relief when the drugs were given together spinally without such side effects.", 
    "21": "Despite conflicting evidence regarding the safety of intrathecal midazolam from animal investigations, its clinical use is increasing. We investigated the potential of intrathecal midazolam to produce symptomatology suggestive of neurological damage. This study compared two cohorts of patients who received intrathecal anesthesia with or without intrathecal midazolam (2 mg). Eighteen risk factors were evaluated with respect to symptoms representing potential neurological complications. The definitions of these symptoms were made wide to maximize the chance of counting patients with neurological sequelae after intrathecal injections. Eleven-hundred patients were followed up prospectively during the first postoperative week by a hospital chart review and 1 mo later by a mailed questionnaire. Symptoms suggestive of neurological impairment, including motor or sensory changes and bladder or bowel dysfunction, were investigated. Intrathecal midazolam was not associated with an increased risk of neurologic symptoms. In contrast, neurologic symptoms were found to be increased by age >70 yr (relative risk, 8.72) and the occurrence of a blood-stained spinal tap (relative risk, 8.07). The administration of intrathecal midazolam, 2 mg, did not increase the occurrence of neurologic or urologic symptoms, as suggested by some preclinical animal experimentation.", 
    "22": "Intrathecal midazolam provides segmental analgesia, but conflicting animal studies have cast doubts on its safety. This investigation studied the effect of intrathecal midazolam by observing two cohorts of patients. In clinical practice, intrathecal midazolam (2 mg) did not increase adverse neurological symptoms compared with conventional therapies.", 
    "23": "The development of effective antiemetic prophylaxis is one of the most significant steps forward in the area of supportive care. Fifteen years ago, patients receiving chemotherapy had to face the fact that nausea and vomiting were inevitable adverse effects, which could only be partially prevented by treatment with antiemetics such as dopamine (DA) D2 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids. The first group of drugs specifically developed as antiemetics was the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT](3)) receptor antagonists. These drugs have dramatically improved prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced emesis, particularly when used in combination with a corticosteroid. This combination has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of patients vomiting, whereas the improvement in the prophylaxis of nausea has been less successful. Another group of antiemetics, the neurokinin (NK) 1 receptor antagonists, has recently been developed, and the first drug in this class, aprepitant, has been approved by the FDA and the EU authorities. Studies have showed that patients benefit from the use of this drug in combination with standard antiemetic therapy (5-HT 3 receptor antagonist plus a corticosteroid), both in the acute and delayed phase of nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This development has not only led to improved efficacy but also to a decreased risk associated with the use of antiemetics. One of the problems with traditional antiemetics, for example, the DA D2 receptor antagonists, is the risk of unpleasant adverse effects including restlessness and dystonic reactions. To avoid these adverse effects, combination with benzodiazepines or antihistamines was necessary, often resulting in sedation. Modern research also includes pharmacogenomic investigations. This has led to speculation about the importance of drug-drug interactions involving antiemetics through competition for metabolism by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The worst possible interaction would be a decrease in the effect of different cytotoxins but there is no evidence that such interactions are of importance in daily clinical practice. Guidelines are useful tools in the optimisation of antiemetic prophylaxis but, unfortunately, implementation of the evidence-based recommendations is far from successful. A prerequisite for further optimisation of antiemetic prophylaxis is updating of the guidelines, including recommendations for the use of NK 1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant), followed by implementation of these recommendations in the clinic. Future research must include 'the difficult trials' focusing on the remaining groups of patients with severe chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, including patients with refractory and breakthrough emesis.", 
    "24": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by initial pancreatic injury resulting from the activation of digestive enzymes and, later, widespread inflammation to distant organs. The aim of this study was to study whether the time-course of inflammatory events during AP induced by bile-pancreatic duct obstruction (BPDO) varies after lowering the acinar enzyme content by L364,718 (0.1 mg/kg/day) administration over 7 days before inducing AP. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping was used to analyse the following at different AP stages: distribution of major circulating leucocyte subsets, activation state of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as reflected by CD11b expression and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production and the contribution of T-cell-derived pro-(TNF-alpha) and anti-(IL-10) inflammatory mediators. TNF-alpha plasma levels and neutrophil infiltration in pancreas and lung were also measured. At early BPDO times, L364,718 treatment partially inhibited leukocytosis and increase in peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes as well as TNF-alpha expression by monocytes. However, from 6 h onwards after BPDO, L364,718 treatment was unable to prevent either pancreatic and lung neutrophil infiltration or the release of TNF-alpha from activated monocytes. By its action on circulating lymphocytes, L364,718 treatment enhanced the severity of the inflammatory response induced by BPDO. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were recruited from earlier BPDO times, and 12 h after BPDO, T cells displayed a significantly higher reserve of TNF-alpha able to be released under stimulation but lower functional reserve of interleukin-10 (IL-10) than observed in untreated rats. It is concluded that lowering the acinar enzyme content through L364,718 treatment prevents earlier systemic immune events in BPDO-induced AP. However, at the point of maximal injury, the inflammatory response became pronounced, largely due to the role played by activated T lymphocytes.", 
    "25": "Since benzodiazepines have been used widely in the treatment of anxiety, sleeplessness, and epilepsy, the receptor sites for the benzodiazepine are of prime importance. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies and receptor modeling via Flexible Atom Receptor Model (FLARM) for the binding affinities of a series of imidazobenzodiazepines at five recombinant receptor subtypes were carried out successfully. The 3D-QSAR models for all five receptor subtypes were examined by a set of test set and demonstrated their high predictability for affinities of imidazobenzodiazepines at five receptor subtypes. The pseudoreceptors yielded by FLARM were compared to the united pharmacophore/receptor model. The result shows that two hydrogen bonds and other regions in the united pharmacophore/receptor model are presented in the pseudoreceptors, which demonstrates the receptor modeling capability of FLARM. The models and pseudoreceptors can help design high affinity ligands on the GABA(A)/BZ receptor and understand the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "26": "To determine the involvement of the globus pallidus in mediating epilepsy, the effects of microinjection of a GABA uptake blocker (tiagabine), a benzodiazepine agonist (zolpidem) and a GABA-B receptor agonist (baclofen) on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced tonic seizure were examined in adult rats. Administration of PTZ induced tonic seizures in all control animals, accompanied with a 100% mortality rate. Pretreatment with bilateral intrapallidal microinjection of tiagabine (1 mM) suppressed the incidence of tonic seizures to 67.7% and reduced the mortality rate to 16.7%. Furthermore, the latency to tonic seizures was 1,275 +/- 277 s, which was significantly longer than that of the corresponding control animals (319 +/- 225 s). On the other hand, administration of zolpidem (1 mM) was without significant effects on the mortality rate, the incidence and latency of the tonic seizure. In sharp contrast, microinjection of baclofen (1 mM) completely suppressed PTZ-induced tonic seizures and reduced the mortality rate to 0%. This effect was largely abolished by co-injection of the GABA-B receptor antagonist CGP55845. To elucidate the direct cellular action of baclofen, the excitability and membrane potential of globus pallidus neurons were studied by cell-attached and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the brain slice. Bath application of baclofen (50 microM) significantly reduced the firing of these neurons, and was often accompanied by a clear membrane hyperpolarization, in a CGP55845-sensitive manner. These data suggest that activation of GABA-B receptors in globus pallidus could significantly modulate PTZ-induced tonic seizures.", 
    "27": "During the last few years there have been numerous publications concerning glucose dysregulation and antipsychotic treatment with new-onset diabetes and exacerbation of existing disease being reported. At the same time three anecdotal reports describing decrease of blood glucose level during clozapine and olanzapine treatment were published. Here we report two cases of clinically significant dose-related reductions in glucose levels in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients suffering from pre-existing type 2 diabetes during high dose (40 mg/day) olanzapine treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first report of decreasing glucose blood levels in association with olanzapine therapy in pre-existing type 2 diabetes. Antipsychotic treatment with high doses of olanzapine showed that the relationship between olanzapine and glucose regulation is more unambiguous than usually assumed.", 
    "28": "There is a need for further studies in order to define the influence of high dose olanzapine for schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.", 
    "29": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is often regarded as a safe choice for psychosis management. We hereby report an aged case that presented with conscious depression, bradycardia, hypotension, miosis and hypothermia. Olanzapine was thought to be the offending agent. His condition improved with supportive therapy.", 
    "30": "This article is a report on a complicated case of delusional disorder in pregnancy and lactation, and effective multidisciplinary treatment. Few reports in the literature concern delusional disorder in pregnancy, or regard olanzapine's safety in pregnancy and lactation. A gravid woman in her third trimester merited twin diagnoses of delusional disorder and borderline personality disorder, and was successfully treated with olanzapine and psychotherapy during pregnancy and lactation. Her infant was large for gestational age (LGA) and had Erb's palsy, which resolved, and remained healthy at six months, with continued breastfeeding. Her delusional beliefs did not recur, nor did she have postpartum depression or psychosis.", 
    "31": "We reviewed the current diagnosis and treatment of status epilepticus (SE). The SE is defined as the condition in which a seizure persists for a sufficient length of time or is repeated frequently enough that recovery between attacks does not occur. Until recently, the most popular duration of seizures qualifying as SE has been 30 min. Nonetheless some clinicians suggest that the duration of the seizures that qualifies the SE should be shorter. In clinical settings the diagnosis of SE could be difficult without EEGs in patients who have complex partial SE or subtle SE, as their manifestation is coma without apparent motor sings. Pseudo-SE (psychogenic seizures) should be included in the differential diagnosis. Antiepileptic treatment should be administered immediately according to the protocol once the diagnosis of SE is made. In patients with refractory SE, general anesthesia with propofol or midazolam is recommended. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the brain is effective for the treatment of SE in experimental animals, however further studies are necessary for clinical use.", 
    "32": "Upon clinical examination of involuntary movement, its correct diagnosis and classification is most important for choosing its most appropriate treatment. Correct diagnosis of involuntary movements should be based on their clinical characteristics rather than laboratory data. First attention should be paid to the way of its occurrence; whether it repeats itself at a relatively regular period or it occurs irregularly. Among irregular movements, chorea and ballism (us) belong to the same category clinically as well as neuropharmacologically; both respond to benzodiazepine and D2 receptor blockers. Dyskinesia and akathisia are often drug-induced. Athetosis often overlaps chorea and dystonia. Dystonia is characterized by excessive muscle contraction in terms of strength, spread and duration. Recently involvement of the sensori-motor cortex is emphasized in generation of focal dystonia. Myoclonus is usually caused by abrupt muscle contraction but also by sudden cessation of muscle contraction (negative myoclonus). Myoclonus and tics are usually irregular, but they can be rhythmic or quasiperiodic. Tremor is often associated with dysfunction of basal ganglia, cerebellum or thalamus, but recently an increasing attention has been paid to involvement of the sensori-motor cortex. Some involuntary movement could show features of two or more kinds of involuntary movements or it may shift among different kinds of involuntary movements or among different subgroups of that particular involuntary movement. Therefore, it is not advisable to feel obliged to classify every single involuntary movement into any pre-existing category. Instead a more flexible approach is warranted.", 
    "33": "The impossibility of treating patients with sleep disorders adequately means that, as specialists, we have to look for new pharmacological treatments and for this reason we examined the information in the paper by Salin Pascual (1999) about the increase in deep sleep when olanzapine is used as an antipsychotic drug.", 
    "34": "We decided to use this medication in six females and three males who were suffering from different sleep disorders that conditioned their chronic insomnia. The dosages of olanzapine used ranged from 2.5 and 10 mg in a single dose. The clinical history and progress were used to elaborate the results and conclusions. The result was positive in eight of the nine patients, five who were administered the medication as monotherapy and three as polytherapy.", 
    "35": "The population studied is insufficient to prove the effectiveness of the drug, but the fact that in eight of our patients the treatment clearly improved their symptoms leads us to think that this line of research must be continued.", 
    "36": "The use of atypical antipsychotic agents is associated with the induction of both an indolent progression to insulin-resistant diabetes and an idiosyncratic beta-cell toxicity presenting as diabetic ketoacidosis, both of which are usually reversible or improved subsequent to cessation of treatment. The underlying mechanisms are unclear at present. Nonetheless, in light of the now numerous reports on the adverse metabolic effects of these drugs, the Consensus Development Conference which met in November 2003 recommends that metabolic risks be considered when starting atypical antipsychotic drugs. Their operative checklist includes baseline screening of candidates for antipsychotic treatment, which includes personal/family history of diabetes, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and fasting lipid profile, and then follow-up of these parameters. Furthermore, the health professionals, patients, family and caregivers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, especially when acute decompensation occurs which is commensurate with diabetic ketoacidosis. We wish, through this short report, to raise the awareness of physicians treating psychiatric patients to the possibility of new-onset diabetes during therapy with atypical antipsychotic drugs and to emphasize the necessity for increased vigilance and close metabolic follow-up of these patients. Moreover, the choice of the best antipsychotic treatment for each patient should take into consideration the diabetogenic effect of the different treatment options as well the other side effects.", 
    "37": "(1) Lithium is the first-line treatment for patients with acute mania. For patients with psychosis or intense agitation, an oral neuroleptic can be added (haloperidol or chlorpromazine, the best-assessed drugs of this class). (2) The licensed indications for oral olanzapine, a neuroleptic, explicitly mention the treatment of acute mania. (3) The clinical evaluation dossier on olanzapine in this setting (10 mg to 15 mg/day) is not particularly impressive. In particular, clinical trials included patients with a variety of associated psychotic symptoms. (4) The only comparative trial against another neuroleptic, haloperidol at a high starting dose (10 mg), showed that olanzapine was no more effective. The same applies to a trial comparing olanzapine with disodium valproate. (5) One placebo-controlled trial tested olanzapine as an additional treatment in patients who did not respond adequately to lithium or valproate disodium. Olanzapine potentiated the antimanic effects of the original treatment but also increased the incidence of adverse effects. (6) In patients with acute mania, the main adverse effects of olanzapine are drowsiness, weight gain, dizziness, and dry mouth. In the trial comparing olanzapine with haloperidol, olanzapine caused fewer extrapyramidal side effects but more weight gain than haloperidol. (7) Olanzapine costs 20 times more than haloperidol in France. (8) In practice, olanzapine is just another neuroleptic approved for the treatment of acute mania in patients with psychotic symptoms and agitation. There is no evidence that olanzapine has the best risk-benefit ratio in this category.", 
    "38": "1 Nootropic drugs increase glucose uptake into anaesthetised brain and into Alzheimer's diseased brain. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TRH, which has a chemical structure similar to nootropics increases cerebellar uptake of glucose in murine rolling ataxia. This paper shows that nootropic drugs like piracetam (2-oxo 1 pyrrolidine acetamide) and levetiracetam and neuropeptides like TRH antagonise the inhibition of glucose transport by barbiturates, diazepam, melatonin and endogenous neuropeptide galanin in human erythrocytes in vitro. 2 The potencies of nootropic drugs in opposing scopolamine-induced memory loss correlate with their potencies in antagonising pentobarbital inhibition of erythrocyte glucose transport in vitro (P<0.01). Less potent nootropics, D-levetiracetam and D-pyroglutamate, have higher antagonist Ki's against pentobarbital inhibition of glucose transport than more potent L-stereoisomers (P<0.001). 3 Piracetam and TRH have no direct effects on net glucose transport, but competitively antagonise hypnotic drug inhibition of glucose transport. Other nootropics, like aniracetam and levetiracetam, while antagonising pentobarbital action, also inhibit glucose transport. Analeptics like bemigride and methamphetamine are more potent inhibitors of glucose transport than antagonists of hypnotic action on glucose transport. 4 There are similarities between amino-acid sequences in human glucose transport protein isoform 1 (GLUT1) and the benzodiazepine-binding domains of GABAA (gamma amino butyric acid) receptor subunits. Mapped on a 3D template of GLUT1, these homologies suggest that the site of diazepam and piracetam interaction is a pocket outside the central hydrophilic pore region. 5 Nootropic pyrrolidone antagonism of hypnotic drug inhibition of glucose transport in vitro may be an analogue of TRH antagonism of galanin-induced narcosis.", 
    "39": "In addition to its action as a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to mediate excitatory action by activating cation currents in some cell types in invertebrates. However, to date no GABA receptor capable of mediating such action has been identified at the molecular level in insects. Using a systematic expression screening approach, we found that the Drosophila ligand-gated ion channel subunits GRD and LCCH3 combine to form cation-selective GABA-gated ion channels when coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The heteromultimeric receptor is activated by GABA (EC50=4.5 microm), muscimol (EC50=4.8 microm) and trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (EC50=104.5 microm), and partially by cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (EC50=106.3 microm). Picrotoxin effectively blocked the GABA-gated channel (IC50=0.25 microm), but bicuculline, TPMTA, dieldrin and lindane did not. The benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and diazepam did not potentiate the GABA-evoked current. Our data suggest that heteromultimeric channels composed of GRD and LCCH3 subunits form GABA-gated cation channels in insects.", 
    "40": "Terminal restlessness is an important issue in the management of symptoms at the end of life with between 25% and 88% of dying patients exhibiting this condition. (1-5) The purpose of this review was to examine the empiric evidence about the pharmacological treatment for terminal restlessness. All available literature, in all languages, from 1966-2002 including randomized trials, concurrent observations, retrospective chart reviews, single case studies, clinical practice guidelines, expert consensus, single expert opinion articles, and editorials were reviewed as \"best available evidence.\" Of the 72 articles reviewed, 14 met the criteria and were chosen for analysis. Despite the majority of authors recommending neuroleptic medications as a first or second line pharmacological treatment of restlessness, a number of studies demonstrated the effectiveness of other medications such as benzodiazepines (notably midazolam and lorazepam), or phenothiazines, either alone or in combinations. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that a single medication or class of medications is appropriate for terminal restlessness. There is a clear need for additional trials of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and combination protocols to determine which protocols are the most effective and have the least side effects.", 
    "41": "To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of quetiapine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder.", 
    "42": "Electronic databases; industry submissions made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.", 
    "43": "Randomised trials and economic evaluations that evaluated the effectiveness of quetiapine, olanzapine or valproate semisodium in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder were selected for inclusion. Data were extracted by one reviewer into a Microsoft Access database and checked for quality and accuracy by a second. The quality of the cost-effectiveness studies was assessed using a checklist updated from that developed by Drummond and colleagues. Relative risk and mean difference data were presented as Forest plots but only pooled where this made sense clinically and statistically. Studies were grouped by drug and, within each drug, by comparator used. Chi-squared tests of heterogeneity were performed for the outcomes if pooling was indicated. A probabilistic model was developed to estimate costs from the perspective of the NHS, and health outcomes in terms of response rate, based on an improvement of at least 50% in a patient's baseline manic symptoms derived from an interview-based mania assessment scale. The model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the alternative drugs when used as part of treatment for the acute manic episode only.", 
    "44": "Eighteen randomised trials met the inclusion criteria. Aspects of three of the quetiapine studies were commercial-in-confidence. The quality of the included trials was limited and overall, key methodological criteria were not met in most trials. Quetiapine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium appear superior to placebo in reducing manic symptoms, but may cause side-effects. There appears to be little difference between these treatments and lithium in terms of effectiveness, but quetiapine is associated with somnolence and weight gain, whereas lithium is associated with tremor. Olanzapine as adjunct therapy to mood stabilisers may be more effective than placebo in reducing mania and improving global health, but it is associated with more dry mouth, somnolence, weight gain, increased appetite, tremor and speech disorder. There was little difference between these treatments and haloperidol in reducing mania, but haloperidol was associated with more extrapyramidal side-effects and negative implications for health-related quality of life. Intramuscular olanzapine and lorazepam were equally effective and safe in one very short (24 hour) trial. Valproate semisodium and carbamazepine were equally effective and safe in one small trial in children. Olanzapine may be more effective than valproate semisodium in reducing mania, but was associated with more dry mouth, increased appetite, oedema, somnolence, speech disorder, Parkinson-like symptoms and weight gain. Valproate semisodium was associated with more nausea than olanzapine. The results from the base-case analysis demonstrate that choice of optimal strategy is dependent on the maximum that the health service is prepared to pay per additional responder. For a figure of less than 7179 British pounds per additional responder, haloperidol is the optimal decision; for a spend in excess of this, it would be olanzapine. Under the most favourable scenario in relation to the costs of responders and non-responders beyond the 3-week period considered in the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of olanzapine is reduced to 1236 British pounds.", 
    "45": "In comparison with placebo, quetiapine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium appear superior in reducing manic symptoms, but all drugs are associated with adverse events. In comparison with lithium, no significant differences were found between the three drugs in terms of effectiveness, and all were associated with adverse events. Several limitations of the cost-effectiveness analysis exist, which inevitably means that the results should be treated with some caution. There remains a need for well-conducted, randomised, double-blind head-to-head comparisons of drugs used in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder and their cost-effectiveness. Participant demographic, diagnostic characteristics, the treatment of mania in children, the use of adjunctive therapy and long-term safety issues in the elderly population, and acute and long-term treatment are also subjects for further study.", 
    "46": "Weak transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex results in excitability shifts during and after the end of stimulation, which are most probably localized intracortically. Anodal stimulation enhances excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation reduces it. Although the after-effects of tDCS are NMDA receptor-dependent, nothing is known about the involvement of additional receptors. Here we show that pharmacological strengthening of GABAergic inhibition modulates selectively the after-effects elicited by anodal tDCS. Administration of the GABA(A) receptor agonist lorazepam resulted in a delayed, but then enhanced and prolonged anodal tDCS-induced excitability elevation. The initial absence of an excitability enhancement under lorazepam is most probably caused by a loss of the anodal tDCS-generated intracortical diminution of inhibition and enhancement of facilitation, which occurs without pharmacological intervention. The reasons for the late-occurring excitability enhancement remain unclear. Because intracortical inhibition and facilitation are not changed in this phase compared with pre-tDCS values, excitability changes originating from remote cortical or subcortical areas could be involved.", 
    "47": "The effect of anxiety on impairment in activities of daily living was examined among elderly individuals residing in a long-term care setting. Eighty one subjects received complete assessments of psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, and ability to perform daily living tasks. A multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the relative influence of anxiety, cognitive status, and depressive symptoms on daily living skills. The presence of anxiety was significantly associated with reduced functional status in performing activities of daily living. This relationship remained significant even after controlling for the presence of concurrent depressive symptoms as well as cognitive impairment. Anxiety is a significant source of morbidity among elderly individuals and substantially impairs social function over and above the effects of depression and cognitive decline. Current interventions for anxiety such as benzodiazepines may have adverse cognitive effects, hence more specific intervention strategies for anxiety may be very important for this population.", 
    "48": "Atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated beneficial effects on affective symptoms, in addition to antipsychotic activity. Consequently, their role in the treatment of bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant or psychotic depression has been explored. Adjunctive atypical antipsychotic therapy appears to benefit patients experiencing manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and some studies suggest that monotherapy may also be efficacious. Clinical studies of patients with schizoaffective disorder and major depression support the use of atypical antipsychotics to treat depression. This review focuses on risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone and provides evidence that these drugs demonstrate activity against manic episodes of bipolar disorder when used as adjunctive therapy and possibly as monotherapy and that depression in patients with schizoaffective disorder also responds to these agents.", 
    "49": "As the opening scenario illustrates about Mary and Bob, bipolar disorder can be devastating to individuals and families. Managing symptoms through psychotropic medications can help people with mental illness better manage their lives. Our brief review of the current research supports the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic medications and, therefore, supports their use in treating bipolar disorder.", 
    "50": "Many anxiety disorders are not treated to remission (symptom-free state); however, this should be the minimum goal of therapy. Antidepressant therapies have shown significant beneficial effects in the management of anxiety disorders, with some variability in results in specific disorders. In social anxiety disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine extended release (XR) have demonstrated efficacy, with response rates varying between 40% and 68%. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and cognitive-behavioural therapies are also effective. In patients with generalized anxiety disorder, benzodiazepines, paroxetine, and venlafaxine XR have demonstrated remission rates that are 15% to 25% higher than placebo. In patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, about 60% to 70% of patients experienced a response with antidepressant therapy, compared with about 40% on placebo, while remission rates in one study were 30% with venlafaxine, 24% with sertraline, and 20% with placebo. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a 25% to 35% improvement in symptom scores was reported in 20% to 65% of patients. In the management of panic disorder, paroxetine and venlafaxine XR doubled the percentage of patients who were panic-free, compared with placebo. Ongoing antidepressant therapy further improved remission rates, and many patients with anxiety disorders required extended treatment trials before experiencing benefit. In most clinical trials, some benefits were seen within 3 to 4 weeks but continued to accrue throughout the 3- to 6-month duration of the trial. In the acute phase, patients with anxiety disorders should be treated aggressively with antidepressants for extended periods and may require long-term therapy to maintain benefits. Cognitive-behavioural therapy is another mainstay in the treatment of all anxiety disorders; exposure to feared situations is necessary to move beyond phobic avoidance and functional impairment to full recovery, the ultimate goal of therapy.", 
    "51": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the kinetics and dynamics of midazolam when administered by three different infusion schemes, using electroencephalography to measure pharmacodynamic effects. In a three-way crossover study, 8 volunteers received midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) by constant-rate intravenous infusion. The durations of midazolam infusions for the three trials were 1 minute, 1 hour, and 3 hours. Plasma midazolam concentrations and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the 13- to 30-Hz range were monitored for 24 hours. Based on separate analysis of each subject-trial, mean values for volume of distribution and distribution or elimination half-life did not significantly vary. Central compartment volume and clearance differed among the three midazolam infusion trials; however, the magnitude of change was small. EEG activity in the 13- to 30-Hz range significantly increased for all three midazolam infusion trials. Plots of midazolam plasma concentration versus pharmacodynamic EEG effect for the 1-hour and 3-hour infusion trials did not reveal evidence of either counterclockwise or clockwise hysteresis. Plots from the 1-minute infusion trial demonstrated counterclockwise hysteresis, consistent with an equilibration effect-site delay. This was incorporated into a kinetic-dynamic model in which hypothetical effect-site concentration was related to pharmacodynamic EEG effect via the sigmoid E(max) model. Analysis of all three infusion trials together yielded the following mean estimates: maximum EEG effect, 16.3% over baseline; 50% maximum effective concentration, 31 ng/mL; and an apparent rate constant for drug disappearance from the effect compartment which approached infinity. Despite the delay in effect onset during the 1-minute midazolam infusion, midazolam infusions in duration of up to 3 hours produce CNS sedation without evidence of tolerance.", 
    "52": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of two noncompetitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists, GYKI 52466 and GYKI 53405 (the racemate of talampanel) on the generation of spike-wave discharges (SWD) parallel with the vigilance and behavioral changes in the genetic absence epilepsy model of WAG/Rij rats. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of GYKI 52466 (1-[4-aminophenyl]-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine; 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.), the prototypic compound of the 2,3-benzodiazepine family, caused a fast dose-dependent increase in the number and cumulative duration of SWD. These changes were accompanied by dose-dependent increase in duration of light slow wave sleep (SWS1) and passive awake, vigilance states associated with the presence of SWD. In addition a short, transient behavioral activation occurred that was followed by strong ataxia and immobility, decrease of active wakefulness and increase in deep slow wave sleep. GYKI 53405 (7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8-methyl-8,9-dihydro-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-b][2,3]benzodiazepine, the racemate of talampanel, 16 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to affect any measure of SWD and vigilance. When used as a pretreatment, GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg) slightly attenuated SWD-promoting effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, it decreased cumulative duration and average time of paroxysms. In conclusion, AMPA receptors play moderate role in regulation of epileptic activity, and some of these effects are connected to their effects on vigilance in this model.", 
    "53": "In some mammals, epileptic seizures have been induced in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and other limbic structures after the sudden suppression of chronically infused GABA. This hyperexcitability state induced by the endogenous neurotransmitter resembles the withdrawal seizure-responses to other GABA(A) receptor agonists such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol. Hyperexcitability induced by GABA withdrawal also persists in in vitro preparation. Hippocampal slices, obtained from rats with seizures induced by GABA-withdrawal showed field potential oscillations and paroxysmal activity in the Ammon's horn region 1. During GABA-withdrawal hyperexcitability the threshold of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) decreased to a point in which a brief frequency stimulation that normally failed to produce long lasting changes in synaptic strength, was now able to induce LTP. Facilitation of the LTP induction was associated with a decreased GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory activity, because the effect of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, was occluded during hyperexcitability and the dose-response curve for bicuculline showed a 50% efficacy reduction with a shift in the effective concentration required for half-maximal activation from 4.5-1.1 microM relative to controls. Nevertheless, the dissociation constant of the antagonist did not change significantly. Our results support the idea that changes in hippocampal plasticity under altered inhibitory neurotransmission states, like those induced by withdrawal syndromes to anxiolytic, sedative or anticonvulsant drugs may be engaged during seizures.", 
    "54": "Diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) is the only medication approved by the US FDA for the management of selected, refractory patients with epilepsy, on stable regimens of antiepilepsy drugs, who require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased seizure activity. An analysis of the safety of diazepam rectal gel reveals that this formulation has certain advantages over intravenous diazepam administration: most notably a very low incidence of respiratory depression, low potential for abuse and the opportunity for out-of-hospital use by non-professional caregivers. Sedation is the most common adverse effect of rectal diazepam treatment, occurring in approximately one-quarter of patients, although drug-induced somnolence is difficult to distinguish from normal post-ictal sedation. Overdosage of diazepam rectal gel is rarely associated with serious clinical consequences, and overdoses of up to 330% of the maximum recommended dosage have been reported without any respiratory or cardiac depression. Under-administration may be a serious safety issue because of morbidity that may result if seizures are not terminated. Chronic administration may cause tachyphylaxis and should be avoided.", 
    "55": "In simulated discrimination conditioned reflex of active avoidance (CRAA) in T-maze, the effect of bilateral microinjections of the muscarinic receptor M1 selective blocker pirenzepine on the CRAA formation and behaviour in the \"open filed\" test, was studied in rats. A sharp worsening of the CRAA learning and a significant increase in the motor activity were shown to occur in rats following the microinjections as compared with control rats. The change in the motor responses seems to account for the worsening of the CRAA learning. Another reason of the phenomenon could involve a disorder in perception of conditioned signals and their poor differentiation. The data obtained and the literature data suggest a complex character of changes induced by the blockade of the M1 muscarinic receptors of the neostriatum.", 
    "56": "The aim of this study is to identify a possible function of Active Sleep (AS), also known as Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REM) in humans, as a protective state during early Central Nervous System (CNS) development. Previous research suggest pharmacological agents that inhibit high levels of neuronal activity in the CNS (e.g., benzodiazepines, ethanol, and anesthetics) precipitate massive CNS programmed cell death (PCD), in developing mammals. AS is characterized by high levels of CNS activity at levels comparable to waking. AS occupies up to 75% of the circadian cycle in developing mammals (rodents from postnatal days 1-14 days (p1-p14), and humans from prenatal month seven to postnatal year one). Many studies have implicated AS as having an active role in the normal development of the visual system and have documented myriad behavioral anomalies as a result of AS deprivation. Reduced adult brain mass has also been observed after AS deprivation in developing rats during this period, however, no study to date has documented this process as it occurs (i.e., the cellular mechanisms that result in behavioral anomalies or reduced adult brain mass). The purpose of this study is to begin documentation of this process by utilizing histological techniques that identify the PCD process, if it occurs, after acute and prolonged AS deprivation in rats from ages p7 to p14 (a time of active synaptogenesis). Our methodology includes utilization of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine, to deprive rat pups of AS at ages varying from p7 to p14. Pilot data from our laboratory has shown that an acute exposure to clonidine significantly reduces time spent in AS. The animals that were AS deprived also showed a statistically significant decrease in brain mass and have stained positively for PCD. If our hypotheses are correct, this research will have major implications with regard to determining the function(s) of REM sleep.", 
    "57": "Psychotic symptoms frequently occur in patients with comorbid medical disorders and present a diagnostic and treatment challenge. They may be a part of an independent psychiatric illness associated with the underlying medical condition or induced by substance use or medications. The presence of psychotic symptoms can contribute to misdiagnosis or complicate the management of the comorbid medical illness. Psychiatrists must be familiar with the assessment and management of psychotic disorders in patients with comorbid medical disorders. Medications that may be used to treat psychosis include antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, or possibly certain anticonvulsants. Selecting the appropriate medication requires knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of different agents and their side effect profile. Understanding the neuropsychiatric effects of medications and drug-drug interactions may help in preventing psychotic symptoms.", 
    "58": "We report the case of a 17-year-old-boy with schizophrenia who developed tardive dystonia after 9 months of treatment with olanzapine. This case and the relevant literature show that when neuroleptic treatment is indicated, switching to another atypical neuroleptic might be helpful for both tardive dystonia and schizophrenia. In such a case, clozapine appears to be the first-line therapeutic option.", 
    "59": "Compared to other laboratory animals, little is known about the use of anesthetics in birds, potentially resulting in the use of improper dosing regimens.

    "60": "Exposure to di (n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) in utero impairs the development of the male rat reproductive tract. The adverse effects are due in part to a coordinated decrease in expression of genes involved in cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis with a resultant reduction in testosterone production in the fetal testis. To determine the dose-response relationship for the effect of DBP on steroidogenesis in fetal rat testes, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received corn oil (vehicle control) or DBP (0.1, 1.0, 10, 50, 100, or 500 mg/kg/day) by gavage daily from gestation day (GD) 12 to 19. Testes were isolated on GD 19, and changes in gene and protein expression were quantified by RT-PCR and Western analysis. Fetal testicular testosterone concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay. DBP exposure resulted in significant dose-dependent reductions in mRNA and protein concentration of scavenger receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and cytochrome P450c17. Testicular testosterone was reduced at doses of 50 mg/kg/day and above. Whole-testis expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) mRNA, which functions with StAR to transport cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane, was upregulated following exposure to DBP at 500 mg/kg/day. By immunocytochemistry, however, PBR protein was reduced in interstitial cells and also expressed but not reduced in gonocytes. Our results demonstrate a coordinate, dose-dependent reduction in the expression of key genes and proteins involved in cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis and a corresponding reduction in testosterone in fetal testes following maternal exposure to DBP, at dose levels below which adverse effects are detected in the developing male reproductive tract. Alterations in gene and protein expression and testosterone synthesis may serve as sensitive indicators of testicular response to DBP.", 
    "61": "Olanzapine has previously been shown to stimulate the growth of neuronal cells in culture. A major goal of the present studies was to determine if olanzapine also provided neuroprotection to pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. Olanzapine was mitogenic and enhanced the survival of PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and 3T3 preadipocytes, but not L6 myoblasts or myeloma cells. It protected neuronal cells from death induced by serum and glutamine deprivation, amyloid beta peptide (25-35), and fluphenazine. Molecular mechanisms of the neuroprotection by olanzapine were explored, specifically the activation of various protein kinase signaling pathways including Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), ERK1/2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38. Olanzapine treatment led to rapid phosphorylation of kinases from all three pathways in PC12 cells. Phosphorylation of Akt was blocked with selective inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002), which implicates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in the signaling cascade. Short-term mitogenic effects of olanzapine were abolished with a selective inhibitor of Akt, but not by inhibition of the ERK pathway. Other antipsychotic drugs stimulated phosphorylation of a subset of the kinase panel, but not all three kinases. The present findings demonstrate that olanzapine has both mitogenic and neuroprotective effects in neuronal cells.",

    "63": "Superimposed muscle spasms result in simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles which are detectable by electromyography (EMG) and relieved by administration of benzodiazepines. The exacerbation of SPS by emotional stressors often results in the referral of these patients for psychiatric assessment although this was more common before the discovery of an association with antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD antibodies). Formerly known as stiff-man syndrome, the female to male ratio is 2:1 and the principle paraneoplastic variant is associated with breast cancer. Although rare, this is a disease of middle age that severely curtails the functional capacity of those it strikes. It is frequently associated with diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. IVIg is recently demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of SPS; diazepam remains useful in managing the symptoms.",

    "65": "Since its discovery in 1988 by Yanagisawa et al., endothelin (ET), a potent vasoconstrictor, has been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. Many research groups have embarked on the discovery and development of ET receptor antagonists for the treatment of such diseases. While several compounds, e.g., ambrisentan 2, are in late clinical trials for various indications, one compound (bosentan, Tracleer) is being marketed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Inspired by the structure of ambrisentan 2, we designed a novel class of ET receptor antagonists based on a 1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-2-one scaffold. Here, we report on the preparation as well as the in vitro and in vivo structure-activity relationships of these derivatives. Potent dual ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonists with affinities in the low nanomolar range have been identified. In addition, several compounds efficiently reduced arterial blood pressure after oral administration to Dahl salt sensitive rats. In this animal model, the efficacy of the benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-2-one derivative rac-39au was superior to that of racemic ambrisentan, rac-2.", 
    "66": "We conducted a prospective double-blind study of accelerated dose titration of olanzapine in the treatment of newly admitted acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia. Patients were randomized to either oral olanzapine (10 mg per day) or oral haloperidol (10 mg per day), plus lorazepam as needed (up to 12 mg per day). Antipsychotic dosage was increased to 20 mg per day as early as day 3. Patients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Agitation subscale during the first 24 hours of treatment, daily for the first week, then weekly until study completion. Significant within-group improvement was demonstrated in PANSS Agitation scores for both groups as early as 1 hour after initiating therapy (-5.79 +/- 6.30 for olanzapine and -4.89 +/- 6.05 for haloperidol, P <.001). This study demonstrated that accelerated dose titration of oral olanzapine is as efficacious as oral haloperidol in reducing acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "67": "Animals chronically administered with diazepam (DZM -- 2 mg/kg/day i.p.) or vehicle (VEH) for 21 days were tested in a fear-conditioning paradigm 4 days after the last administration. Increased freezing was observed in DZM withdrawn rats as compared to VEH injected control rats in both associative and nonassociative context and this increase was greatest for the DZM withdrawal group in the paired context. In animals anesthetized with urethane, single pulses in the medial prefrontal cortex evoked a field potential including a population spike (PS) in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) of control animals, whereas in DZM withdrawn animals multiple PSs were evoked. In brain slices from control rats, stimulation of the external capsule evoked a field potential including a PS in the BLA, whereas in DZM withdrawn rats multiple PSs were evoked. The amplitude of the PS was smaller in slices obtained from DZM withdrawn rats than from control rats, and paired pulse inhibition was significantly less in the former. Perfusion with DZM 2 microM of slices obtained from DZM withdrawn rats eliminated repetitive spiking. GABAergic blockade with 50 microM picrotoxin in control rats resulted in the appearance of multiple secondary PSs. In slices from DZM withdrawn rats high-frequency stimulation induced a highly significant potentiation that lasted at least 2 h (LTP), whereas in control rats the same stimulation did not induce LTP. Neuronal hyperexcitability leading to facilitated LTP observed in BLA of DZM withdrawn rats could be due to depressed GABAergic activity (dysinhibition). The increased synaptic plasticity may be at the root of the increased fear learning observed in withdrawn animals.", 
    "68": "In a previous work [J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 23 (2000) 447] a rapid high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, using a monolithic column in HPLC coupled with a diode-array detector, was developed for the quantitative determination of benzodiazepines in whole blood. The present method has been applied to the assay of eight benzodiazepines amongst the most frequently encountered in forensic toxicology: clonazepam, desalkylflurazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, nordiazepam and oxazepam. The sample pre-treatment involved a liquid-liquid extraction of blood samples by n-butyl chloride. The separation was carried out in reversed-phase conditions using a Chromolith Performance (RP-18e 100 x 4.6 mm) column. The mobile phase was composed of a phosphate buffer (35 mM, pH 2.1) and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) and the flow-rate was 2 ml/min. The duration of the analysis was less than 4 min and the results of validation, including linearity, precision, recovery, limit of quantification, were satisfactory. The therapeutic and toxic concentrations usually encountered for these substances could be measured. The compounds were separated by a monolithic column which, on account of its particular structure, could bear higher flow-rates than usually found for this kind of analysis. The present method has been applied to two real cases and was tested with about 30 compounds.", 
    "69": "Glutamate receptor currents were examined in horizontal cells from cultured human retina using whole-cell recording procedures. Horizontal cells possess both AMPA and kainate receptors and both produce significant sustained currents. The kainate-induced current did not show significant desensitization and was not enhanced by concanavalin A. The sustained AMPA current was smaller than the kainate current, but the difference was almost entirely due to pronounced desensitization. The horizontal cell AMPA current was enhanced by cyclothiazide but not by PEPA, indicating the presence of the flip receptor variant. GYKI-52466 blocked the AMPA response (IC50 = 5 microM against 100 microM AMPA) but also blocked the kainate response (IC50 = 45 microM against 100 microM kainate). The diversity of glutamate receptors in human horizontal cells suggests that synaptic input to these neurons may be multiplexed through both kainate and AMPA channels.", 
    "70": "We obtained intracellular recordings from transient, On-Off amacrine and ganglion cells of the turtle retina. We tested the ability of neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists to modify the responses to light stimuli. The metabotropic glutamate agonist, 2-amino-phosphonobutyric acid (APB), selectively blocked On responses, whereas the amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, GYKI, blocked both On and Off responses. Although GYKI appeared to block excitation completely, suggesting an absence of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated responses, it was found that in the presence of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) blockers, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) was prolonged. The late component of the EPSP was blocked by the NMDA antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (D-AP5). Picrotoxin (PTX) and bicuculline (BCC) induced a mean hyperpolarization of -6.4 mV, suggesting a direct effect of GABA on transient amacrine and ganglion cells, since antagonism of a GABA-mediated inhibition of release of glutamate by bipolars would depolarize third-order neurons. The acetylcholine agonist, carbachol, or the nicotinic agonist, epibatidine, depolarized all On-Off neurons. This action was blocked by d-tubocurarine. Cholinergic inputs to On-Off neurons increase their excitability without altering the pattern of light responsiveness.", 
    "71": "Earlier we implicated nitric oxide (NO) in mediation of the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines. Since benzodiazepines work through facilitation of GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission, this study was designed to determine whether the direct-acting gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor agonist THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol) evokes behavioral effects similar to those of benzodiazepines and whether behavioral effects of THIP are also NO dependent. When challenged with either chlordiazepoxide or THIP in an elevated plus-maze paradigm, male NIH Swiss mice exhibited a dose-related increase in open-arm activity. The chlordiazepoxide-induced effects were sensitive to antagonism by a benzodiazepine antagonist, and the effects of THIP were blocked by a GABAA receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NG-nitro arginine antagonized the effects of both chlordiazepoxide and THIP; similar pretreatment with the D-isomer, D-NG-nitro arginine, which is inactive as an NOS inhibitor, was without effect on chlordiazepoxide and THIP. These findings indicate that chlordiazepoxide and THIP evoke similar behavioral effects in mice in the elevated plus-maze through actions on different parts of the GABAA receptor, and that NO appears to play a key role in mediation of the behavioral effects of both chlordiazepoxide and THIP.", 
    "72": "We have established an animal model for olanzapine-induced body weight gain, and used it to explore the relation between this weight gain, excessive food consumption, gross motor activity, and macronutrient choice. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received olanzapine (OLAN) or diluent (1.2mg/kg per day) via gavage for 10 days. Rats receiving OLAN exhibited significant increases in body weight when compared with control rats. Body weight returned to control levels once OLAN treatment was discontinued. Food consumption among the OLAN-treated group was significantly greater than among control rats between 6 and 10 days of treatment. Between 4 and 10 days of treatment, feed efficiency (grams of weight gained/grams of food consumed) was also significantly greater among animals receiving OLAN. In contrast, chronic administration of haloperidol (0.04mg/kg; q.d.; gavage) did not influence body weight or food consumption of treated rats. Gross motor activity was significantly reduced by OLAN between 1 and 10 days of treatment, also returning to control levels when treatment was discontinued. No significant changes were observed in brain DA, DOPAC, HVA or 5-HIAA among animals receiving OLAN daily for 30 days; however, 5-HT levels were significantly elevated. In contrast, acute (1.2mg/kg; 2h; i.p.) administration of OLAN significantly increased brain DOPAC and HVA levels without affecting those of 5-HT or 5-HIAA. OLAN (1.2mg/kg; q.d.; 10 days) administration did not alter macronutrient choice (carbohydrate:protein ratio) of rats. These data show that an animal model of OLAN-induced weight gain is readily generated, and suggest that the weight gain results at least in part from increased food intake, reduced gross motor activity, and enhanced feed efficiency.", 
    "73": "Fipronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) is a highly active, broad spectrum insecticide from the phenyl pyrazole family, which targets the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor. Although fipronil is presently widely used as an insecticide and acaricide, little information is available with respect to its metabolic fate and disposition in mammals. This study was designed to investigate the in vitro human metabolism of fipronil and to examine possible metabolic interactions that fipronil may have with other substrates. Fipronil was incubated with human liver microsomes (HLM) and several recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms obtained from BD Biosciences. HPLC was used for metabolite identification and quantification. Fipronil sulfone was the predominant metabolite via CYP oxidation. The K(m) and V(max) values for human liver microsomes are 27.2 microM and 0.11 nmol/mg proteinmin, respectively; for rat liver microsomes (RLM) the K(m) and V(max) are 19.9 microM and 0.39 nmol/mg proteinmin, respectively. CYP3A4 is the major isoform responsible for fipronil oxidation in humans while CYP2C19 is considerably less active. Other human CYP isoforms have minimal or no activity toward fipronil. Co-expression of cytochrome b(5) (b(5)) is essential for CYP3A4 to manifest high activity toward fipronil. Ketoconazole, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits 78% of the HLM activity toward fipronil at a concentration of 2 microM. Oxidative activity toward fipronil in 19 single-donor HLMs correlated well with their ability to oxidize testosterone. The interactions of fipronil and other CYP3A4 substrates, such as testosterone and diazepam, were also investigated. Fipronil metabolism was activated by testosterone in HLM but not in CYP3A4 Supersomes. Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in HLM was inhibited by fipronil. Fipronil inhibited diazepam demethylation but had little effect on diazepam hydroxylation. The results suggest that fipronil has the potential to interact with a wide range of xenobiotics or endogenous chemicals that are CYP3A4 substrates and that fipronil may be a useful substrate for the characterization of CYP3A4 in HLM.", 
    "74": "The platelet aggregation is a crucial step in a pathophisiology of thromboses, leading to development of cardio-vascular diseases (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, strokes, etc.). The final step in the aggregation is the binding of fibrinogen to receptor - glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) on the surface of activated platelets. In recent years the increasing attention is paid to the role of fibrinogen antagonists in the prevention of thrombosis. The search for these compounds is based on the molecular design of structures mimicking some fragment of RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence, responsible for the binding of fibrinogen to GP IIb/IIIa. Up to now, a large number of potent and selective GP IIb/IIIa antagonists, including non-peptide inhibitors are identified (derivatives of benzodiazepines, aminobenzamidinosuccinyles, isoxazolines, isoquinolines). The modification of natural peptide structures for obtaining of more active and selective fibrinogen receptor antagonists is realized in several ways: substitution of main pharmacophores of RGD sequence; cyclization of RGD-containing peptides; design of conformationally constrained peptidomimetics. For the treatment of chronic cardio-vascular diseases, the clinic needs high orally active RGD-peptidomimetics. This task is realized by obtaining of prodrugs on the base of the most potent RGD-mimetics. In our laboratory the molecular design and synthesis of non-peptide fibrinogen receptor antagonists were carried out. The series of RGD-mimetics on the basis of 4-oxo-(piperazine-1-yl)butyric acid as Arg-mimetic and beta-aryl-beta-alanines as Asp-Phe-mimetics were synthesized. Obtained RGD-mimetics showed a high antiaggregatory activity in vitro experiments with IC(50)values of 10(-7) - 10(-9) M.", 
    "75": "Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes (alpha, betaI, betaII, gamma, delta, epsilon, eta, theta) are major receptors of tumor promoters and also play a crucial role in cellular signal transduction via the second messenger, 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DG). Each isozyme of PKC is involved in diverse biological events, indicating that it serves as a novel therapeutic target. Since PKC isozymes contain two possible binding sites of tumor promoters and DG (C1A and C1B domains), the design of agents with binding selectivity for individual PKC C1 domains is a pressing need. We developed a synthetic C1 peptide library of all PKC isozymes for high-throughput screening of new ligands with such binding selectivity. This peptide library enabled us to determine that indolactam and benzolactam compounds bound to the C1B domains of novel PKC isozymes (delta, epsilon, eta, theta) in some selective manner, unlike phorbol esters and DG. Simpler in structure and higher in stability than the other potent tumor promoters, a number of indolactam and benzolactam derivatives have been synthesized to develop new PKC isozyme modulators by several groups. We focused on the amide function of these compounds because recent investigations revealed that both the amide hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen of indolactam-V (ILV) are involved in hydrogen bonding with the C1B domains of PKCdelta. Synthesis of several conformationally fixed analogues of ILV led to the conclusion that the trans-amide restricted analogues with a hydrophobic chain at an appropriate position (2,7) are promising leads with a high binding selectivity for novel PKC isozyme C1B domains. We also developed a new lactone analogue of benzolactam-V8 (17) which shows significant binding selectivity for the C1B domains of PKCepsilon and PKCeta. Furthermore, our synthetic approach with the PKC C1 homology domains clarified that diacylglycerol kinase beta and gamma are new targets of phorbol esters.",

    "79": "Annual rates of BDZ prescribing in Belgrade from 1990 to 1999 were rather uniform (approx. 25 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day), with slight tendency to decrease. In Serbia as a whole, there were significant differences in the annual prescribing rates over the period 1998-2000. The wholesale of BDZ in Serbia significantly increased between 1991 and 2001, with the peak of 133 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day in 1999. The wholesale of BDZ was significantly greater that the rates of prescribing in corresponding years. Over the 10 year period, the numbers of visits to GPs and psychiatrists and the number of neurotic diagnoses were significantly reduced. The use of BDZ in psychiatric hospital increased significantly in 1999 as compared to 1998, although the number of admissions and the occupancy of hospital beds were reduced. In primary health care, diazepam was the most frequently prescribed drug predominantly for non-psychiatric diagnoses.",

Oral (0.5 mg/kg) and rectal (0.35 mg/kg) midazolam was compared in view of acceptance of the mode of treatment and local anesthesia, level of amnesia, and adverse effects. Although oral or rectal midazolam application has similar characteristics in respect to ease of working, the oral midazolam application should generally be preferred because it is more easily accepted by pediatric patients.", 
    "82": "Mechanisms underlying the pathological characteristics of the various anxiety disorders have yet to be fully elucidated. One of the most widely accepted mediators known to play a central role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is the g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. Evidence supporting the role of a dysfunctional GABA system has resulted from clinical experience with the benzodiazepines, as well as subsequent determination of mechanism of action, genetic engineering, and neuroimaging studies of the GABA receptor. The concatenation of results suggests a relative deficiency in GABA neurotransmission, which can be augmented by agents acting on different components of the GABA system. Agents such as the benzodiazepines, neuroactive steroids, and barbiturates act as allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor; b-carboline and the barbiturates function as direct GABA agonists. Valproate, gabapentin, pregabalin, and vigabatrin increase brain GABA levels or neurotransmission at least in part by targeting the metabolic pathways of GABA. Tiagabine selectively increases synaptic GABA availability by blocking the reuptake of GABA via transporter inhibition. Evidence exists, to a greater or lesser extent, that all of these agents possess anxiolytic properties, as would be expected by their mechanisms of action. This article reviews the findings implicating the GABA system in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and describes the potential role of agents that modulate GABA neurotransmission in the treatment of these disorders.", 
    "83": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a 18-kDa high-affinity drug and cholesterol binding protein, that has been implicated in several physiological processes, such as cholesterol transport and mitochondrial respiration. Specific PBR ligands regulate cell proliferation, although their action is controversial and probably cell-type specific. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of PBR in cells of mesenchymal origin, i.e. human fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells, as well as its role in the regulation of their proliferation. Both mesenchymal cell types express high levels of PBR, localized exclusively in mitochondria. PBR-specific drug ligands, the isoquinoline carboxamide PK 11195 and the benzodiazepine Ro5-4864, at relative high concentrations (10(-4)M), exert a strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation by arresting the cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, while no apoptotic cell death was observed. In normal fibroblasts, this inhibition was correlated with a decrease in the activation of the cell cycle markers ERK and c-Jun. PBR knockdown by RNA inhibition did not affect the proliferation of either cell type and did not influence the inhibitory effect of PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 on cell growth. These data suggest that in fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells PBR drug ligands inhibit cell proliferation in a PBR-independent manner. These results are in contrast to data reported on cells of epithelial origin, suggesting that the origin of the cells is crucial in defining the role of PBR in their proliferation, and raise caution in the commonly made assumption that PBR mediates cell functions affected by PBR drug ligands.", 
    "84": "The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of prophylactic treatment for patients with febrile convulsions (FCs) in whom electroencephalograms (EEGs) revealed epileptiform discharges. We retrospectively investigated 43 patients who met the following criteria: (a) at least one FC during the study period; (b) epileptiform discharges were first recognized; (c) no unevoked seizures before epileptiform discharges were first seen; (d) normal psychomotor development and no neurological abnormality; and (e) follow-up >3 years. The clinical characteristics, treatment, and a later occurrence of FCs or unevoked seizures were studied. EEGs revealed focal epileptiform discharges in 25 patients and generalized ones in 18. There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of FC or occurrence of unevoked seizures between those with focal and generalized epileptiform discharges. No prophylaxis was performed in ten patients, 14 patients being treated with intermittent diazepam and 19 with a daily anticonvulsant. The rate of recurrence of FC was not significantly different between patients with and without prophylaxis. Unevoked seizures were only observed in two patients undergoing daily treatment. Intermittent or daily anticonvulsant therapy will not reduce the risk of recurrence of FCs or later development of unevoked seizures in patients with FC with epileptiform discharges.", 
    "85": "The startle potentiated startle (SPS) paradigm has been reported to be an effective procedure for studying the conditioned enhancement of acoustic startle in the absence of electric shocks or extinction. This study examines the effects of two anxiolytic treatments, buspirone and alprazolam, on this SPS effect. Subjects were tested in the SPS paradigm 2 days a week (Monday and Thursday) for 10 weeks. Each startle test session consisted of 10 Noise Alone trials (115 dB acoustic noise burst presented for 40 ms) and 10 Light+Noise trials (115 dB acoustic stimuli presented during the latter 40 ms of a 3,540 ms period in which a 15-watt light was illuminated). Although there was no difference in startle amplitude on Noise Alone trials when compared to Light+Noise trials initially, by the end of the first test session and continuing throughout the duration of the experiment, startle amplitude on Light+Noise trials was significantly (approximately 50-75%) greater than on Noise Alone trials. After five control (i.e., no injection) SPS test sessions, once-weekly drug challenges were conducted over the course of 7 weeks. In these weekly drug challenges, subjects received acute treatment with various doses of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic alprazolam (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg) or the novel anxiolytic buspirone (1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mg/kg); subjects also received vehicle treatment (0.5% methylcellulose) on one treatment day. All treatments were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), 15 min before the start of startle testing. Consistent with previous reports, buspirone increased and alprazolam decreased startle amplitude on the Noise Alone trials; these effects were dose-related. Both agents reduced the magnitude of the SPS effect when it was expressed as the Light+Noise startle amplitude minus the Noise Alone startle amplitude. These findings are similar to the effects of these treatments in the traditional shock-based fear-potentiated startle paradigm.", 
    "86": "Benzodiazepines are sedative hypnotics that produce marked anterograde amnesia in humans. These pharmacological properties are thought to result from the potentiation of GABA-A receptor function and subsequent attenuation of long-term potentiation (LTP), however many reports have suggested this is not the case for triazolam. Using electrophysiological recordings in a cell line expressing recombinant GABA-A receptors, we confirm that triazolam is an efficacious positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors. Triazolam also slowed the decay of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents, reduced the amplitude of fEPSPs elicited during a theta burst and reduced the magnitude of LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurones in vitro. These data show that triazolam modifies LTP induction consistent with an enhancement of GABA-A receptor function via activation of the allosteric benzodiazepine-site.",

    "91": "Ischemic injury to the CNS results in loss of ionic homeostasis and the development of neuronal death. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ is well established, but there are few studies of changes in intracellular Cl- ([Cl-]i) after ischemia. We used an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation) to examine changes in [Cl-]i and GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses in hippocampal slices from adult rats. Changes in [Cl-]i were measured in area CA1 pyramidal neurons using optical imaging of 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium chloride, a Cl--sensitive fluorescent indicator. Oxygen-glucose deprivation induced an immediate rise in [Cl-]i, which recovered within 20 min. A second and more prolonged rise in [Cl-]i occurred within the next hour, during which postsynaptic field potentials failed to recover. The sustained increase in [Cl-]i was not blocked by GABA(A) receptor antagonists. However, oxygen-glucose deprivation caused a progressive downregulation of the K+-Cl- cotransporter (KCC2), which may have contributed to the Cl- accumulation. The rise in [Cl-]i was accompanied by an inability of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol to cause Cl- influx. In vivo, diazepam is neuroprotective when given early after ischemia, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. Here, we added diazepam early after oxygen-glucose deprivation and prevented the downregulation of KCC2 and the accumulation of [Cl-]i. Consequently, both GABA(A) responses and synaptic transmission within the hippocampus were restored. Thus, after oxygen-glucose deprivation, diazepam may decrease neuronal excitability, thereby reducing the energy demands of the neuron. This may prevent the activation of downstream cell death mechanisms and restore Cl- homeostasis and neuronal function",

While this component has gained great importance in studies on clinical populations and in basic research on auditory information processing, the involvement of different neurotransmitters in the generation of this component is less well understood. We investigated the impact of the benzodiazepine lorazepam as a GABA agonist on the neuromagnetic MMN (MMNm) and auditory evoked field component N100m. A group of 12 healthy subjects was studied in single blind trials under the following three conditions: after the intake of 1.25 mg lorazepam, 100 mg caffeine or placebo. Neuromagnetic recordings were obtained before drug intake and three times after it. Controlled visual attention was tested additionally using a version of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). The neuromagnetic activity was reconstructed by a single moving dipole, and the dipole moment and its latency were compared between conditions and time points of measurement. Lorazepam diminished the signal detection performance in the CPT 25 min after drug intake. The source of the field component N100m was attenuated, most significantly in the recording 105 min after lorazepam intake. The attenuation of the MMNm under lorazepam became significant at 105 min, but was visually less apparent, because in all conditions a decrease of the MMNm dipole moment within the course of a session was observed. Besides the already known effects of benzodiazepines on controlled attention functions, preconscious attention functions as reflected in the MMN are impaired by acute benzodiazepine intake. MMN studies on clinical populations have to be controlled for the recording time because of the strong habituation of this component.", 
    "103": "Previously, we reported (Cagetti, Liang, Spigelman, and Olsen, 2003) that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment leads to signs of alcohol dependence, including anxiety and hyperactivity, accompanied by reduced synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (A) receptor (GABAAR) function and altered sensitivity to its allosteric modulators consistent with a measured switch in subunit composition. In this study, we separated the synaptic and extrasynaptic components of GABAAR activation in recordings from pyramidal CA1 cells of hippocampal slices and demonstrated marked differences in the responsiveness of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs to agonists and allosteric modulators in control rats, and in the way they are altered following CIE treatment. Notably, tonic inhibition mediated by extrasynaptic GABAARs was differentially sensitive to the partial agonist gaboxadol (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol; THIP) and the allosteric modulator zolpidem, compared with the miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the same cells from saline-treated rats. After CIE treatment, potentiation of tonic currents by diazepam and zolpidem was lost, whereas potentiation by the alpha4 subunit-preferring benzodiazepine Ro15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and THIP was only partially reduced. Potentiation of synaptic GABAAR currents by zolpidem was eliminated after CIE, whereas THIP slightly inhibited mIPSCs from control rats and greatly enhanced them after CIE treatment. These results are consistent with alpha1 subunit decreases at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs, whereas alpha4 subunits are increased at synaptic and decreased at extrasynaptic GABAARs. Behaviorally, THIP was active as a hypnotic and anxiolytic but not as an anti-convulsant against pentylenetetrazol seizures in control rats. Only slight tolerance was observed to the sleep time, but not to the anxiolytic, effect of THIP after CIE. Thus, differential alterations in synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs appear to play an important role in the brain plasticity of alcohol dependence, and withdrawal signs may be profitably treated with GABAergic drugs such as THIP, which does not show cross-tolerance with ethanol.", 
    "104": "Ghrelin secretion has been reportedly increased by fasting and energy restriction but decreased by food intake, glucose, insulin, and somatostatin. However, its regulation is still far from clarified. The cholinergic system mediates some ghrelin actions, e.g. stimulation of gastric contractility and acid secretion and its orexigenic activity. To clarify whether ghrelin secretion undergoes cholinergic control in humans, we studied the effects of pirenzepine [PZ, 100 mg per os (by mouth)], a muscarinic antagonist, or pyridostigmine (PD, 120 mg per os), an indirect cholinergic agonist, on ghrelin, GH, insulin, and glucose levels in six normal subjects. PD increased (P < 0.05) GH (change in area under curves, mean +/- SEM, 790.9 +/- 229.3 microg(*)min/liter) but did not modify insulin and glucose levels. PZ did not significantly modify GH, insulin, and glucose levels. Circulating ghrelin levels were increased by PD (11290.5 +/- 6688.7 pg(*)min/ml; P < 0.05) and reduced by PZ (-23205.0 +/- 8959.5 pg(*)min/ml; P < 0.01). The PD-induced ghrelin peak did not precede that of GH. In conclusion, circulating ghrelin levels in humans are increased and reduced by cholinergic agonists and antagonists, respectively. Thus, ghrelin secretion is under cholinergic, namely muscarinic, control in humans. The variations in circulating ghrelin levels induced by PD and PZ are unlikely to mediate the cholinergic influence on GH secretion.",

The expression of bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein was determined, respectively, by in situ hybridization in tissue sections and Western blot on tissue samples from rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. The bcl-2 mRNA positive cells were increased in these regions after drug treatments, and quantitative analysis revealed that the upregulation of bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein is significantly greater than in vehicle control (p<0.05 or p<0.01). It is demonstrated that neuroprotective protein Bcl-2 is involved in the action of atypical antipsychotic drugs, and might represent a neuroprotective mechanism of these drugs.",

Animal studies have clearly demonstrated sedative efficacy for these compounds in acute studies. However, relatively less is known regarding their efficacy under brief periods of repeat administration or following intermittent dosing. Therefore zolpidem, a short-acting GABAAR modulator with selectivity for the type-I (omega1) benzodiazepine receptor, was studied for efficacy in altering rat sleep architecture as determined by electrocorticogram (ECoG) and electromyogram (EMG) activity over a 7-day sub-chronic administration period. Zolpidem caused significant reductions in wakefulness entries and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep entries and duration, with increases in Delta sleep duration throughout the administration period. Examination of sleep architecture 24 h after cessation of sub-chronic zolpidem administration revealed a decrease in Delta sleep, suggesting that repeated zolpidem administration might elicit enduring modifications to sleep organization. This was not seen following similar dosing of diazepam. The efficacy of sub-chronic administration of zolpidem to alter sleep architecture was enhanced when the administration regimen was repeated following a 7-day hiatus. Significant increases in Delta sleep duration, with significant decreases in light sleep and wakefulness were observed during the repeated exposure to zolpidem. Therefore, sub-chronic administration of zolpidem affected lasting modifications in sleep organization that appeared both 1 day following administration and during reiterated administration without eliciting tolerance.",

These compounds have consistently higher binding affinity for the GABAA alpha5 receptor subtype over the other benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptor subtypes (alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3). Compounds with a range of efficacies for the benzodiazepine site of alpha5-containing GABAA receptors were identified, including the alpha5 inverse agonist 3,3-dimethyl-8-methylthio-5-(pyridin-2-yl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one 22 and the alpha5 agonist 8-ethylthio-3-methyl-5-(1-oxidopyridin-2-yl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one 19.", 
    "108": "Vasopressin receptor antagonists can elicit ion-sparing diuretic effects (i.e., aquaresis) in vivo by blunting the action of the circulating hypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin. We have identified two new series of basic tricyclic benzodiazepines, represented by general structure 1, which contain compounds that bind with high affinity to human V2 receptors. For example, (S)-(+)-8 and 5 are potent and selective V2 receptor antagonists with pronounced aquaretic activity in rats on oral administration.", 
    "109": "The objective of this research was to model benzodiazepine deagglomeration profiles of percent agglomerated versus time when interactive mixtures containing micronized benzodiazepines were added to water. Micronized diazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and, for ternary mixtures, micronized sodium lauryl sulfate were mixed with lactose-povidone granules (250-355 microm). After rapid dissolution of the lactose granules, bimodal particle size distributions of benzodiazepines, determined by laser diffraction particle sizing, represented dispersed and agglomerated distributions. The concentrations of agglomerated particle decreased with time and approached constant values. Deagglomeration profiles were determined and best modeled by a three-parameter single-exponential decay equation. A nonlinear least-squares approach was used to estimate the concentration of dispersible (C(0)) and nondispersible agglomerates (C(0a)) and the deagglomeration rate constant (K(a)). Increasing benzodiazepine and sodium lauryl sulphate concentrations in the lactose-povidone mixtures increased both dispersible and nondispersible agglomerate concentrations. Deagglomeration rate was relatively fast with half-lives around 15 min. The estimated parameters of C(0a) and K(a) may provide useful information in optimizing the design of formulations of poorly water soluble, micronized drugs to maximize their dispersion.", 
    "110": "Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist with specific action at the central benzodiazepine receptor. It is used when benzodiazepine intoxication is suspected. Its use has also been reported in cannabis intoxication, chloral hydrate overdose, hepatic encephalopathy, and alcohol intoxication. We report the case of a 7-month-old male infant with a depressed level of consciousness after intentional intoxication of antihistamines, whose mental status fully recovered after administration of flumazenil. To our knowledge, this is the first case in children where flumazenil has been reported to reverse antihistamine-induced coma.", 
    "111": "Bz-423 is a 1,4-benzodiazepine with selective lymphotoxic properties and potent therapeutic activity against lupus-like disease in autoimmune mice. In NZB/W lupus-prone mice, Bz-423 specifically kills germinal center B cells, which are the cells that drive disease both in this model and in human systemic lupus erythematosus. In this report, the mechanistic basis for the selective action of Bz-423 is investigated. We show that Bz-423-induces superoxide as an immediate early response and that this reactive oxygen species is more effective as a second messenger death signal in B cells activated by B cell receptor stimulation compared with resting cells. As a result, low [Bz-423] that are not cytotoxic to non-stimulated cells kill stimulated cells in synergy with anti-immunoglobulin M antibodies. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that Bz-423 extends the rise in intracellular calcium that accompanies anti-immunoglobulin M stimulation, and this effect mediates the synergistic death response. Because B cell hyperactivation and altered calcium signaling is a distinguishing feature of autoreactive lymphocytes in lupus, the mechanism by which Bz-423 induces apoptosis preferentially targets disease-causing cells on the basis of their activation state. Thus, molecules like Bz-423 could form the basis for new and selective anti-lupus agents.", 
    "112": "Differentiation of pseudoseizures from epileptic seizures and hysterical stridor from asthma is key to the treatment of patients. Both pseudoseizures and hysterical stridor are associated commonly with sexual abuse, eating disorders, depression, substance abuse, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Failure to reach an appropriate diagnosis results in inappropriate medical care including recurrent intubations, antiepileptic drugs, and excessive hospitalizations. This case represents the first instance of reported pseudoseizures in a patient with hysterical stridor secondary to childhood sexual abuse.", 
    "113": "Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, is usually given intravenously in status epilepticus. The aim of this study was to determine whether intranasal midazolam is as safe and effective as intravenous diazepam in the treatment of acute childhood seizures. Seventy children aged 2 months to 15 years with acute seizures (febrile or afebrile) admitted to the pediatric emergency department of a general hospital during a 14-month period were eligible for inclusion. Intranasal midazolam 0.2 mg/kg and intravenous diazepam 0.2 mg/kg were administered after intravenous lines were established. Intranasal midazolam and intravenous diazepam were equally effective. The mean time to control of seizures was 3.58 (SD 1.68) minutes in the midazolam group and 2.94 (SD 2.62) in the diazepam group, not counting the time required to insert the intravenous line. No significant side effects were observed in either group. Although intranasal midazolam was as safe and effective as diazepam, seizures were controlled more quickly with intravenous diazepam than with intranasal midazolam. Intranasal midazolam can possibly be used not only in medical centers, but also in general practice and at home after appropriate instructions are given to families of children with recurrent seizures.", 
    "114": "SJG-136 is a synthetic pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer in which two DNA-alkylating subunits are linked through an inert propanedioxy tether. Biophysical and biochemical studies of SJG-136 have shown a remarkable affinity for DNA and potent cytotoxicity in vitro. On this basis, together with its unique sequence selectivity and interstrand DNA cross-linking activity, SJG-136 has been selected for clinical trials. This study examines the pharmacological characteristics of SJG-136 and provides the first report of pharmacokinetic properties for this agent. A sensitive, selective and reproducible reversed-phase gradient LC/MS assay has been developed for detection and analysis, where a molecular ion ( m / z 557.2) is detectable for the SJG-136 parent imine. Fluorescence detection (260 nm excitation, 420 nm emission) gives a limit of sensitivity of 5 nM (2.5 ng ml(-1)) for analysis of SJG-136 in mouse plasma. Extraction efficiencies from plasma were >65% across a range of concentrations (5-1000 nM). Following administration to mice at the MTD (i.p., 0.2 mg kg(-1)), high peak plasma concentrations of SJG-136 were seen ( C (max) = 336 nM) at 30 min after dosing. A calculated terminal t (1/2) of 0.98 h and AUC of 0.34 microM.h resulted in a clearance rate of 17.7 ml min(-1) kg(-1). The PBD dimer binds only moderately to proteins (65-75%), and in vitro cytotoxicity studies confirmed IC(50) values of 4-30 nM with a panel of human cell lines. This finding demonstrates that plasma concentrations achieved in the mouse are substantially higher than those required to elicit an anti tumour response in vitro. This report forms an important phase in the pre-clinical characterization of the compound.", 
    "115": "We studied the effects of low-dose midazolam with propofol for patient control sedation (PCS) in 30 healthy (ASA grade I) patients who were randomly allocated into two equal groups (n = 15 in each). They were given a propofol infusion of 2mg/kg/h after a bolus dose of 0.7 mg/kg. The second group was given the 2mg/kg/h propofol infusion after a dose of midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and a bolus dose of propofol 0.7 mg/kg. The standard dose for PCS was propofol 0.2mg/kg in both groups. Clinical data were taken and haemodynamic variables, and oxygen saturation were recorded before and on the 5th, 10th, 20th, and 30th minutes during the operations. The level of sedation, amnesia and conditions of each patient were evaluated during the study. Patients' satisfaction was recorded using a modified visual analogue scale (VAS). All results were evaluated statistically. We conclude that low-dose midazolam with propofol during PCS neither reduced oxygen saturation nor prolonged the time of discharge. Low-dose midazolam with propofol also improved the acceptability and comfort for patients and made the operation easier, which makes it preferable to propofol alone."
