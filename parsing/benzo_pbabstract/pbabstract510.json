    "0": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the major physiological regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, considerable evidence indicates that CRF may be responsible for integrating not only the endocrine, but the autonomic and behavioral responses of an organism to stress as well. In addition, clinical studies indicate that CRF of both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic origin may be hypersecreted in major depression as well as other psychiatric disorders. These findings, taken together, led to the hypothesis that the efficacy of antidepressant and/or anxiolytic drugs may be related to their actions on CRF-containing neural pathways in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, alterations of CRF concentrations in 18 rat brain regions were studied after acute administration of a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine) or one of two triazolobenzodiazepines (alprazolam or adinazolam) that possess anxiolytic properties typical of benzodiazepines, as well as purported antidepressant activity unique to these compounds. Treatment with alprazolam or adinazolam increased hypothalamic CRF concentrations, which was associated with lower plasma ACTH concentrations. In contrast, the concentration of CRF was markedly reduced in the locus coeruleus, amygdala, and several cortical regions by either triazalobenzodiazepine. Acute treatment with imipramine was without effect on CRF concentrations in any brain region studied. Of particular interest is the finding that the two triazolobenzodiazepines exert effects on CRF concentrations in the locus coeruleus and hypothalamus that are opposite to CRF changes seen after stress.", 
    "1": "Ninety-eight schizophrenic outpatients receiving pharmacotherapy were surveyed on two census days, 18 months apart. From this study sample it was found that, as recently as 1987, 18% of the patients were prescribed three classes of neuroactive drugs--16% two antipsychotic drugs simultaneously. Of antipsychotics receivers, 44% were prescribed anticholinergics, 3% antidepressants, and 4% benzodiazepines. Between census days, a significant shift from use of oral antipsychotics to the depot form of administration occurred, while polypharmacy frequency remained unchanged. An analysis of the data will provide guidelines for rendering a more rational pharmacological treatment.", 
    "2": "Activity of hippocampal neurons was recorded in a dissociated culture under patch-clamp conditions. Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (PSCs) were evoked in response to short pulse application of glutamate to other neurons in the culture dish. These PSCs were suppressed by topical application of acetylcholine (ACh) near the recorded neuron. The dose-dependent effect of the muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine indicates that the effect of ACh is mediated by an M2 receptor. ACh did not affect inward current responses to direct application of glutamate onto postsynaptic neurons. This indicates that ACh may interfere with the release process and not with the postsynaptic response to the neurotransmitter. In some cells, ACh reduced inward Ca currents recorded in the presence of Na and K channel blockers. This effect was atropine sensitive and may underly the reduced PSCs. It is suggested that ACh modulates release of neurotransmitters by reducing presynaptic Ica and thereby reducing evoked PSCs.", 
    "3": "In an investigation of benzodiazepine (BDZ) prescription patterns, psychiatrists in private practice were found to exhibit \"therapist non-compliance\" with regard to general medical recommendations for BDZ use. The findings indicate that BDZ prescriptions in general (53% among patients treated with psychotropics) as well as long-term treatment of patients (37%) are quite common among private practice psychiatrists. BDZ treatment is not restricted to \"minor psychiatric disorders\", and contrary to the guidelines, even patients with substance dependence are not excluded. A positive association was found for BDZ use and patients' self-reported symptoms and health complaints, the number of other medications prescribed and age. In a discussion of therapist non-compliance it is proposed that this may be a consequence of a symptom-based treatment model, individual health concepts, the doctor-patient relationship and physician's cost-benefit analysis. Thus, psychiatrists' non-compliance may reflect to some extent a case-oriented treatment rationale.", 
    "4": "A method is described for the quantative determination of gastric mucosal lesions induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in mice and rats. The area and number of gastric lesions present in formalin-fixed, glycerol-cleared mucosa is determined by computerized visual image analysis using instrumentation as described. The method is also applied to the determination of the protective effects of anti-ulcer agents (e.g. prostaglandin E2, pirenzepine). Thus this method affords unambiguous sensitive and determination of the percentage area of the mucosa damaged and the number of the lesions.", 
    "5": "The possible anxiolytic activity of riluzole, a drug which interferes with glutamic acid neurotransmission, was studied in rats using operant conflict procedures. In both \"anxiolytic\" and \"anxiogenic\" procedures, riluzole alone did not possess any anticonflict or proconflict effect at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg PO. Riluzole over the same dose-range was able to antagonize the well known proconflict effect of the beta-carboline derivative FG 7142, an inverse agonist at the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ionophore receptor complex. This effect could be related to the possible interaction of riluzole with glutamic acid neurotransmission, since it has been demonstrated previously that beta-carbolines such as DMCM and beta-CCM were able to deplete the levels of aspartic and glutamic acids in rodent cortex, perhaps by enhancing release of amino acid neurotransmitters. If one subscribes to the hypothesis that the anxiety induced by beta-carboline derivatives is related to depression, riluzole might be of value in the treatment of anxiety related to depression.", 
    "6": "1. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of diazepam (1.5-6 mg/kg) decreased the core body temperature (BT) of the rats. The effect was dose-dependent. 2. The hypothermia produced by diazepam (6 mg/kg, i.p.) was decreased in animals pretreated with high doses of bicuculline (BIC, 3 mg/kg, i.p.), while low doses of BIC (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the hypothermia. 3. Picrotoxin (PIC, 1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment also decreased the hypothermic effect of diazepam. 4. Pretreatment of animals with atropine (AT, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) or propranolol (PRO, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the hypothermic response of diazepam. Phenoxybenzamine (PHEN, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), methergoline (METH, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or pimozide (PIM, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) did not change the diazepam hypothermia. 5. Single administration of BIC, PIC, PRO, PIM or METH also induced hypothermia. 6. One can postulate that diazepam hypothermia may be induced through GABAA receptor sites. However, further studies will clarify this hypothesis.", 
    "7": "A simultaneous consideration of plasma and urine data of unchanged drug and active metabolites, taking into account the metabolic process of the precursor, is described. The maximum likelihood principle was used to estimate parameters. This methodology is highly efficient in determining the contribution of the two main and active metabolites in the pharmacological response of ethyl loflazepate. It also may serve in the search for optimum dosage regimens in clinical practice.", 
    "8": "1. The two-compartment black and white box first described by Crawley and Goodwin (1980) has been used to study anti-anxiety properties of drugs but has not been validated. 2. An automated test system and validation of the protocol for the evaluation of compounds with anxiolytic or anxiogenic potential is described. 3. The box is partitioned into black and white sections with an interconnecting opening and is equipped with micro-switch photoelectric controls (light source and photoreceiver) and an interface connected to the menu-driven computer during anxiety testing. 4. Plasma corticosterone levels in naive mice maintained on a reversed L:D cycle was significantly reduced following restricted exposure to the brightly lit white section but not in the red-illuminated black section. 5. The optimal structural configuration in different test situations was found to be a square rather than a round box. 6. Under normal conditions, mice spend about 60% of the time in the dark compartment so that the exploratory activities and time spent in the white section are taken as a measure of anxiety. 7. Compounds examined included the reference anxiolytic diazepam, nicotine, naloxone, MDL 72222, ICS 205 930 and buspirone, all of which increased mouse exploratory activities in the white section. PTZ, beta-CCP, morphine and amphetamine increased exploration in the black compartment and reduced exploration in the white area. 8. Fluphenazine and imipramine had no specific effects on anxiety responding, although the cataleptogenic effect of fluphenazine was apparent. 9. Daily repeated testing was possible with a maximum of up to four trials a week using naive animals during the 5-min test session. 10. The results suggest that the rapid and automated test system for the assessment of changes in measures of anxiety is not only valid for large scale evaluation of compounds but could be used to elucidate mechanisms of drug action and the CNS pathways linked with anxiolysis and/or anxiogenesis.", 
    "9": "Triacylglycerol and glycogen contents in the gastric mucosa were studied in 20 patients with duodenal ulcer before and after two-week treatment with cimetidine, pirenzepine or proglumide. Determinations of both metabolic substrates were performed in mucosal slices taken from gastric corpus and antrum during endoscopic examination: the results were expressed per mg of protein. Concentrations of triacylglycerol were significantly elevated after treatment with any of the blocking agents: in the gastric corpus by 88% after cimetidine application, 69% after pirenzepine and 102% after proglumide; in the antrum by 76, 59 and 132%, respectively. No significant changes in the mucosal contents of glycogen were observed. It is concluded that an increase in the mucosal concentration of triacylglycerol can be connected with an inhibition of the gastric acid secretion following treatment with receptor-blocking drugs.", 
    "10": "Acute i. p injection of diazepam (3 mg/kg) significantly decreased the open field behaviors (locomotion and rearing) of rats. However, when diazepam (3 mg/kg) was given ip daily for 15 consecutive days, no depressive effect on the open field behaviors was observed. After the open field observation, rats were immediately decapitated and brain slices of cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and brain stem were stimulated by high K+ (65 mmol/L) to cause the release of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT). Diazepam (9 mumol/Ls) significantly depressed the release of monoamine neurotransmitters caused by high K+, which were antagonized by Ro 15-1788 (5 mumol/L) in vitro. Acute administration of diazepam (ip 3 mg/kg) also significantly depressed the release of monoamine neurotransmitters caused by high K+ from all regions observed. However, hippocampus showed tolerance to the depressive effects of diazepam on the releases of NA and DA, and amygdala only on the release of DA, caused by high K+, when given ip chronically (3 mg/kg, 15 d). Our results suggest that the depressive effect of benzodiazepines on the release caused by anxiogenic factors of catecholamine in the hippocampus, front cortex and amygdala regions may be one of the mechanisms of sedative and anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "11": "The authors report on a patient, admitted to a regional hospital in a comatose state of uncertain origin. Anexate (Flumazenil, Ro 15-1788) was used to demonstrate the etiology of this benzodiazepine-induced coma. The almost immediate effect of flumazenil injection on EEG in benzodiazepine induced coma is shown.", 
    "12": "The influence of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 on the motivational properties of rewarding (morphine, nicotine and diazepam) and aversive (naloxone, phencyclidine and picrotoxin) drugs was studied in the rat in a two-compartment place-conditioning paradigm, which included a pre-conditioning test for spontaneous place-preference. The specific D1 dopamine-receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.05 mg/kg SC), paired with both compartments or, separately, with the preferred or with the non-preferred compartment, failed to affect the spontaneous unconditioned preference of the animal. Pairing of morphine (1.0 mg/kg SC), nicotine (0.6 mg/kg SC) or diazepam (1.0 mg/kg IP) with the less preferred compartment induced significant preference for that compartment. Pairing of SCH 23390 (0.05 mg/kg SC) with both compartments completely blocked the place-preference induced by morphine, nicotine and diazepam. Naloxone (0.8 mg/kg SC), phencyclidine (2.5 mg/kg SC) or picrotoxin (2.0 mg/kg IP) paired with the preferred compartment elicited place-aversion. Pairing of SCH 23390 (0.05 mg/kg SC) with both compartments abolished also the place-aversion induced by naloxone, phencyclidine and picrotoxin. The results indicate that blockade of dopamine transmission blocks the motivational properties of rewarding as well as aversive stimuli. It is suggested that neuroleptics rather than simply blocking the rewarding impact of positive reinforcers (anhedonia, lack of pleasure) exert a more general influence on conditioned behaviour by blocking the affective impact of negative as well as positive reinforcers (apathy, lack of motivation).", 
    "13": "The consumption of benzodiazepine drugs (BDZ) in Chile in the period 1982-1986 has been studied by the DDD method. National use was assessed using drug import forms as a source of information, assuming that the total amount imported was manufactured and consumed in the same year. The utilization did not show a constant pattern, being 32.7, 33.6, 50.2, 34.9, and 31.3 DDD 1000 per inhabitants per day in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986, respectively. During the study period, diazepam was the most commonly used agent amongst anxiolytic BDZ, reaching a peak of 27.1 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1984, and flunitrazepam was the most popular hypnotic, attaining its maximum in 1986 (6.4 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day). The use of BDZ at community pharmacy level was also evaluated, employing the International Marketing System (IMS) as the source of information. At that level the pattern of utilization showed a constant increase during the study period, being 14.9 and 25.8 DDD/1000 inhabitants/per day in 1982 and 1986, respectively. In community pharmacies the anxiolytic BDZ most often consumed was diazepam (maximum 9.1 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1985), and the commonest hypnotic was flunitrazepam (peak 6.0 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1986). National consumption of BDZ appeared higher and more variable than use at the community pharmacy level, but in both there was greater usage of anxiolytic than of hypnotic BDZ, and diazepam and flunitrazepam were the most popular agents.", 
    "14": "Orthopaedic operations were performed in 340 rabbits when developing biodegradable rods for the fixation of fractures. The rabbits were anaesthesized by injecting medetomidine combined with ketamine and diazepam (MKD) subcutaneously. The mortality due to the anaesthesia was zero. Arterial blood gas analyses showed a moderate decrease in the haemoglobin oxygen saturation and compensated respiratory acidosis, which was well tolerated by the animals. It is concluded that MKD anaesthesia is well suited for orthopaedic operations in the rabbit.", 
    "15": "Our understanding of how new antiepileptic drugs work mirrors what we know about how currently marketed antiepileptic compounds exert their action--that information is scarce and elusive. The mechanism of action of antiepileptic drugs is nevertheless inextricably linked to epileptogenesis itself, and investigations of several promising new compounds are underway to establish the levels at which these drugs act. Compounds act on synapses and membranes as well as affecting receptors, neurotransmitters, and peptides. The most extensive data are available on drugs that inhibit the action of GABA or its receptors, including new benzodiazepine-like agents and barbituric-acid derivatives. The few drugs that act by inhibiting the effects of excitatory amino acids are reviewed. Finally, the maximal electroshock test is an empirical method to determine the antiepileptic properties of a drug; several agents under development have been effective in this screening technique.", 
    "16": "The muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the benzodiazepine lorazepam both produce transient impairments in memory and attention in normal volunteers. These impairments can be reversed by appropriate agents such as the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine in the case of scopolamine or the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 in the case of lorazepam. In this paper we investigated the pharmacological specificity of these reversals by examining the interactions of scopolamine and Ro 15-1788 and of lorazepam and physostigmine. There was no evidence that the effects of scopolamine and lorazepam on cognitive function could be attenuated by Ro 15-1788 and physostigmine, respectively. The results are discussed in terms of pharmacological models of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "17": "Intracellular recordings were made from neurons in the submucous plexus of the guinea-pig caecum. Muscarinic agonists (acetylcholine, bethanechol and muscarine) depolarized about 70%, and hyperpolarized about 30% of the submucous plexus neurons. Low concentrations of pirenzepine reversibly antagonized both responses. The measured dissociation constants (KD) of 10-30 nM for the depolarizations and 1-3 nM for the hyperpolarizations suggest that each response was mediated by muscarinic M1 cholinoceptors. The muscarinic depolarization and hyperpolarization were associated with a decreased and an increased conductance, respectively, and the reversal potential for the muscarinic responses varied as the potassium concentration varied, always being around the potassium equilibrium potential. In cells depolarized by muscarinic agonists these agents appeared to decrease a potassium conductance that could also be inactivated by substance P. In approximately 30% of the submucous neurons, the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential, elicited in response to single or repetitive focal stimuli (1-10 pulses at 20-40 Hz), appeared to consist of a large component which was sensitive to the blocking action of idazoxan (100-300 nM) and a small component which was idazoxan-insensitive. The latter (muscarinic slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential) was completely abolished by pirenzepine. The concentrations of pirenzepine which caused a 50% depression ranged from 5 to 20 nM. The muscarinic slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential was increased in amplitude and duration by physostigmine (100-300 nM). The muscarinic slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential was accompanied by a decrease in membrane input resistance, and was reversed in polarity near the potassium equilibrium potential. When muscarine induced a hyperpolarization and/or focal stimulation elicited a muscarinic slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential in the presence of idazoxan (100-300 nM), the intracellular injection of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) produced a progressive membrane hyperpolarization during which the muscarinic hyperpolarizing responses were attenuated. It is concluded that the muscarine-induced reduction in potassium conductance is mediated through a muscarinic M1 receptor which has a relatively low affinity for pirenzepine. The muscarine-induced increase in potassium conductance is probably produced by the association of a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein with another muscarinic M1 receptor that has a relatively high affinity for pirenzepine.", 
    "18": "The benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) is an intrinsic allosteric modulatory site of the GABAA-receptor-chloride channel complex of neuronal membranes mediating the main action of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The BZR is unique in recognizing three classes of ligands, two of them producing opposite modulatory effects on the GABAA receptor function in an allosteric fashion (agonists and inverse agonists) and the third acting as antagonists of the two others. Agonists and partial agonists of the BZR (belonging to various chemical classes) have therapeutic applications as broad-spectrum tranquilizers and specific anxiolytics- anticonvulsants, respectively. The BZR antagonist flumazenil, recently introduced in therapy, increases the versatility of agonists in therapy and greatly simplifies the treatment of agonist overdosing. Inverse agonists are interesting probes to analyse the biological basis of anxiety-related emotional disorders.", 
    "19": "Clobazam (Odipam) and Diazepam were investigated by the double blind study method in patients with nonpsychotic anxiety. It was found out that both drugs had equal anxiolytic and tranquilizing effect with the same adverse effects. Greater frequency of excellent marks concerning the final therapeutic effect of Odipam in respect to other marks pointed to its better clinical tolerance, so that this drug was recommended as daily tranquilizer.", 
    "20": "The effects of 1,4-diazepines with two annelated heterocycles [brotizolam (WE 941), ciclotizolam (WE 973) and WE 1008] on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated chloride influx into rat brain membrane vesicles were examined. Brotizolam enhanced GABA (30 microM)-stimulated 36Cl- influx (146.1% of control), while ciclotizolam and WE 1008 showed only a small enhancement (119.3% and 119.1%, respectively) of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. Brotizolam resulted in a left shift of the GABA dose response curve at lower concentrations of GABA (10 microM), while at higher concentrations of GABA (1 mM), brotizolam caused a reduction of the maximal response. The enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake by brotizolam (0.1 microM) was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. At higher concentration of GABA (300 microM), brotizolam inhibited GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in a dose dependent manner and Ro15-1788 failed to antagonize this effect. These results suggest that 1) brotizolam produces an enhancement of GABA (30 microM)-stimulated chloride influx through the benzodiazepine receptor. 2) brotizolam inhibition of GABA (300 microM)-stimulated chloride influx involves an additional mechanism, and 3) the sedative-hypnotic action of brotizolam may be related to its high efficacy at the benzodiazepine/GABA-gated chloride channel.", 
    "21": "The distribution of pinazepam and its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam was studied in fetuses of New Zealand rabbits on the 20th and 27th day of pregnancy. The concentrations of both compounds were also measured in the maternal brain, liver and uterus. Pregnant rabbits were sacrificed at 0.5, 2, 4 and 12 h after intravenous administration of pinazepam (5 mg/kg). The concentrations of pinazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam in various biological specimens were measured by a specific gas-chromatographic procedure. Pinazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam rapidly crossed the placenta. In 20 day old fetuses, comparable concentrations of pinazepam were found in the liver, brain, heart, lungs and kidneys. In contrast, the liver of 27 day old fetuses accumulated pinazepam at concentrations higher than the other tissues. The hepatic extraction of pinazepam, already described in adult rabbits (1), develops prenatally. A preferential accumulation of pinazepam rather than N-desmethyldiazepam was also observed in the maternal uterus. In this tissue the concentrations of pinazepam were 5-10 times higher on the 27th rather than the 20th day of pregnancy. The stage of pregnancy influences the distribution pattern of pinazepam in rabbit fetuses and their mothers.", 
    "22": "The search for a biochemistry of memory may be divided into two consecutive periods: the search for molecular memory coding in the brain (1960-1975), and the ongoing search for biochemical correlates of learning or memory. During the first period, three main methods were used: chemical analysis of macromolecules after learning, studying the effects on learning of compounds (antibiotics) impairing macromolecule synthesis, and attempting chemical transfer of information items acquired by the brain (\"memory transfers\"). None of the three methods succeeded in clearly demonstrating that memory is chemically encoded. Subsequent modern work has focused on the search for correlates between brain chemical mechanisms and memory processes: the role of protein synthesis in memorization, peptide modulation of learning, and the role of the main neurotransmitter systems (particularly acetylcholine, catecholamines, GABA and glutamic acid). The correlates, which are to be interpreted with caution, are based on both pharmacological results in animals and clinical data in man.", 
    "23": "A multicenter study compared the antidepressant efficacy and the tolerance of two doses of milnacipran (50 mg and 100 mg/day) and amitriptyline (150 mg/day) in three parallel groups of 45 major depressive inpatients defined by Research Diagnostic Criteria. After a wash-out period of 4-7 days on placebo with lorazepam and/or nitrazepam if necessary, patients were randomly assigned to a daily dose of milnacipran 50 mg, milnacipran 100 mg or amitriptyline 150 mg reached on the 5th day and then stable over a 4-week period, with weekly assessments by means of the Montgomery and Asberg depression scale, the Hamilton depression scale, the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) and the Target Emergent Signs and Symptoms. Results showed significant superiority of both milnacipran 100 mg/day and amitriptyline over milnacipran 50 mg/day at the end of the treatment period. However, amitriptyline induced a nonsignificant trend toward more rapid improvement after 2 weeks of treatment, mainly based on items related to insomnia, supporting more sedative properties of amitriptyline as compared to milnacipran. Anticholinergic side-effects were significantly lower with milnacipran than with amitriptyline, explaining why milnacipran 100 mg exhibited at the end of the treatment period, a nonsignificantly better efficacy index on the CGI. Moreover, in contrast to milnacipran, amitriptyline was responsible for a significant decrease in blood pressure and a significant weight gain.", 
    "24": "The literature on the effects of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs on performance in tasks requiring sustained attention is confusing. This review is an attempt to evaluate the usefulness of vigilance tasks in the assessment of adverse effects of benzodiazepines. The long, monotonous, character of these tasks may be more relevant to many tasks performed in everyday life than the short, and often stimulating, tasks commonly employed in test batteries. From 37 available studies, 26 were examined in detail. In young, normal volunteers, vigilance tasks were found to be sensitive, often dose dependently, to the impairing effects of drugs, even in low doses (2.5 mg diazepam). With these subjects the tasks may be successfully used to compare different benzodiazepines with respect to residual activity. Both accuracy and speed of performance appear to be affected. However, in people actually using the drugs (\"patients\"), adverse effects on performance are usually not found. There is no evidence that benzodiazepines aggravate the vigilance decrement occurring under normal conditions. They do affect overall level of perceptual sensitivity, but show less effects on response criterion. The drugs do not seem to interact with anxiety or sleep quality in their effect on performance, but there are few studies with patients, and the assessment of anxiety is not without problems. It is unlikely that impairments in vigilance are simply a byproduct of global, sedative effects, but there is uncertainty regarding measures of general sedation. Developing tolerance with repeated doses has been noted only occasionally, but the opposite of tolerance, aggravated impairment, has also been reported.", 
    "25": "In a double-blind and cross-over study 12 healthy subjects took temazepam 20 mg in two different formulations (soft gelatine capsule or uncoated tablet) and matched placebo at one-week intervals. Plasma temazepam concentrations at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 8, 12 and 24 hours after treatment were analyzed by gas chromatography. Psychomotor performance was measured objectively (digit symbol substitution, letter cancellation, Maddox wing test) and subjectively (visual analogue scales) before the drug intake and 1, 2 and 3 hours later and the plasma benzodiazepine concentrations were analyzed also by radioreceptor bioassay. The two different formulations were compared in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic terms, and the gas chromatographic and radioreceptor assays were compared. The soft gelatine capsule produced higher peak plasma concentrations than the uncoated tablet. The computed AUCs and elimination half-lives proved to be similar after either formulation. A satisfactory correlation between the bioassayed benzodiazepine concentrations and chemically assayed temazepam was shown. In pharmacodynamic terms the results suggest a shorter and somewhat smaller subjective response for the capsule than for the tablet form.", 
    "26": "The goal of this experiment was to determine the correlations among different behavioral and neurobiological measures in aged rats. Aged Sprague-Dawley rats were given a battery of cognitive and sensorimotor tests, followed by electrophysiological assessment of sleep and biochemical measurements of various neurotransmitter systems. The behavioral tests included the following: Activity level in an open field; short-term and long-term memory of a spatial environment as assessed by habituation: spatial navigation, discrimination reversal, and cue learning in the Morris water pool; spatial memory in a T-maze motivated by escape from water; spatial memory and reversal on the Barnes circular platform task; passive avoidance; motor skills. Sleep was assessed by electrographic cortical records. The following neurotransmitter markers were examined: Choline acetyltransferase; the density of nicotinic, benzodiazepine and glutamine receptors in the cortex and caudate nucleus; endogenous levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in the cortex and hippocampus. The duration of bouts of paradoxical sleep was strongly correlated with several cognitive measures and selected serotonergic markers. This finding suggests that changes in sleep patterns and brain biochemistry contribute directly to deficits in learning and memory, or that the same neurobiological defect contributes to age-related impairments in sleep and in learning and memory.", 
    "27": "1. To evaluate the influence of beta-blockers and minor tranquilizers on autonomous stress response, 40 healthy subjects selected with regard to personality traits were randomly assigned to 5 groups. 2. Mental arithmetic induced the most pronounced increase in heart rate (HR), blood pressure and epinephrine secretion. 3. Beta-blockers reduced HR increases due to mental stress, whereas the minor tranquilizer reduced skin conductance level throughout the whole trial. 4. Our data provide evidence that different structured situations induce specific response patterns that are differentially modified by beta-blockers and minor tranquilizer.", 
    "28": "1. The therapeutic efficacy on several neuroses between CM6912 and diazepam (DZP) was comparatively investigated by means of intergroup comparison method in a double-blind trials. CM6912 was given to CM-1 group on the basis of twice daily dose of 1 mg each in the morning and evening and to CM-2 group on the basis of once daily dose of 2 mg only in the evening and DZP was given to another group on the basis of three times each dose of 2 mg. 2. As for the overall evaluation, no significant differences were found in the percentages of final global improvement rating among three groups. It resulted in \"markedly improved\" by 22% in CM-2 group, 18% in CM-1 group and 15% in DZP group in order, and \"more than moderately improved\" by 62% in CM-2 group, 56% in DZP group and 51% in CM-1 group in order. 3. As for the overall safety rating, no differences were found in the incidence of adverse reactions. 4. As for the global utility rating, it resulted in \"extremely useful\" by 22% in CM-2 group, 14% in CM-1 group and 8% in DZP group in order, showing significant superiority of CM-2 group to DZP group (p less than 0.05). It resulted in \"more than useful\" by 58% in CM-2 group, 52% in DZP group and 50% in CM-1 group in order.", 
    "29": "Fluphenazine decanoate (25 mg/kg IM every 3 weeks x 6) resulted in spontaneous vacuous chewing mouth movements and jaw tremor in male Sprague-Dawley rats. These movements could be suppressed by the selective D1 or D2 dopamine antagonists SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg) and raclopride (0.5 mg/kg), respectively, and by CCK-8S (50 micrograms/kg). Fluphenazine-induced mouth movements were unaffected by the selective CCK antagonist MK-329, and by a dose of physostigmine (50 micrograms/kg) sufficient to stimulate mouth movements in placebo treated rats. Scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg) suppressed spontaneous mouth movements in placebo-treated rats, but the effect on fluphenazine-induced mouth movements was not significant. A higher dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg) did suppress the neuroleptic-induced mouth movements, but also induced hyperactivity, characterized by increased sniffing and grooming. These findings indicate that mouth movements resulting from the chronic administration of neuroleptics to the rat may serve as a useful pharmacological model of tardive dyskinesia in the human, and suggest that a relative increase of D1 activity as well as impaired CCK function may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder.", 
    "30": "Chlordesmethyldiazepam a long-acting benzodiazepine was compared with lorazepam a short-acting one in a double-blind placebo cross-over study against generalized anxiety disorders. Chlordesmethyldiazepam therapy was more effective than lorazepam. Clinical efficacy, drowsiness and insomnia seem well correlated with pharmacokinetic properties of these two benzodiazepines. These results further support the use of a long-acting benzodiazepine rather than a short-acting one as an anti-anxiety agent.", 
    "31": "Ritanserin, a benzydrilen-piperidine derivative, with a potent, selective and long-lasting antagonist activity on serotonin type 2 receptors, has shown anxyolitic properties and a lesser sedative profile than benzodiazepines. Ritanserin and lorazepam at therapeutical doses, were compared in eight healthy volunteers in a double-blind, cross-over study in order to detect possible different impairments of performances. Before and during the treatment, all subjects were daily submitted to a test of rapidity and regularity of response to acoustic and visual stimuli by means of an electronic device. A visual analogue scale for the self-assessment of the drowsiness degree was also administered. Ritanserin did not modify reaction times, while lorazepam significantly prolonged them. The analysis of data within treatments significantly favoured ritanserin, while between treatments there was only a trend in favour of ritanserin. The analogical scale for concentration showed a significant reduction with lorazepam, whereas for drowsiness no alteration occurred with either drug.", 
    "32": "Twenty Nigerians with labile essential hypertension (LEH) were asked to record their blood pressure and pulse rate for 14-16 hours using the Remler Portable Ambulatory Blood Pressure Recorder while exposing themselves to the stress of Lagos traffic. The average blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate for the test day (ASBP, ADBP and APR) were determined in a cross-over randomised open design before (C), after one week on placebo bidaily (P1), after one week on bromazepam 1.5 mg bidaily (B), after one week on placebo bidaily (P2) and after one week on labetalol 100 mg bidaily (L). Allocation to the active drugs was randomised. All drugs were administered at 8.00a.m. and 8.00p.m. respectively. The maximum blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate MxSBP, MxDBP and MxPR were similarly determined. Both B and L significantly reduced ASBP, ADBP, APR, MxSBP, MxDBP and MxPR but L produced a much greater reduction in the above parameters than B. Side effects observed included drowsiness with B (two subjects) and postural dizziness with L (one subject). Both drugs were effective in controlling LEH but L was more effective than B in reducing stress hypertension.", 
    "33": "Fatal intoxications in the 15-34 age group in the five Nordic countries during the years 1984 and 1985 (Sweden only in 1984) were investigated. The known drug addicts were studied separately. The highest incidence of intoxications, calculated per 10(5) population, was found in Finland (11.3), followed by Denmark (10.3), Sweden (8.5), Iceland (7.2) and Norway (6.6). The percentage of intoxications caused by drugs was 92 in Denmark, 71 in Norway, 66 in Sweden, 50 in Finland and 17 in Iceland. Ethanol intoxications were seen 5-7 and 2-3 times as frequently in Finland and in Iceland, respectively, than in the other three countries. Carbon monoxide intoxications accounted for two-thirds of all fatal intoxications in Iceland. Drug addicts accounted for 62% of all fatal intoxications in the Danish material. The corresponding figures were 33% in the Norwegian, 16% in the Swedish and 5% in the Finnish material. No deaths in drug addicts were found in Iceland. Most drug addicts in Denmark, Norway and Sweden died of hard drugs and most in Norway and Sweden, from heroin or morphine, whereas in Denmark other strong analgesics, such as methadone, dextropropoxyphene and ketobemidone, accounted for 40% of all hard-drug-related fatal intoxications. To a certain extent the results reflect differences in the legal autopsy routines in the various Nordic countries. However, the ascertainment of drug addicts is assumed to be near-complete in each country.", 
    "34": "Putative interactions between the specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan and benzodiazepines (BDZs) were examined in two different rat conflict models; Vogel's drinking conflict test (VT) and Montgomery's conflict test (MT) (the elevated +-maze). In the MT, idazoxan (0.031 mg/kg) produced anxiogenic-like effects, which were counteracted both by the triazolo-BDZ alprazolam (APZ; 0.2 mg/kg) and the conventional BDZ diazepam (DIZ; 0.2 mg/kg). In fact, the anxiolytic-like effects of APZ were significantly potentiated when co-administering idazoxan. A tendency to such a phenomenon was seen also in rats treated with DIZ and idazoxan. In the VT, the anxiolytic-like effects both of APZ (1.0 mg/kg) and DIZ (4.0 mg/kg) were significantly enhanced when co-administering idazoxan (1.0 mg/kg) in a dose not affecting the behavior per se. Similar potentiating phenomena by behaviorally inert doses of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (idazoxan 1.0 mg/kg; yohimbine 2.0 mg/kg) were seen with regard to the ataxic/sedative effects of the BDZs (APZ 0.25 mg/kg; DIZ 1.5 mg/kg). The present results provide further support for the notion that the anxiolytic-like effects of BDZs are not related to attenuation of Locus Coeruleus activity. In addition, it is suggested that the potentiation caused by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist is mediated via a noradrenaline induced increase in signal-to-noise ratio in target neurons of the brain noradrenergic system.", 
    "35": "Tetrazepam is a 1,4 benzodiazepine (BZD) clinically used in France and Germany as a muscle relaxant. The activity of tetrazepam was compared to that of diazepam, baclofen, mephenesin and chlormezanone in mice, in pharmacological models which are predictive of muscle relaxant and sedative properties. Tetrazepam was active in all the 6 tests of muscle relaxation (traction, chimney, inclined screen, grip force, horizontal grid and morphine-induced Straub tail). The overall muscle relaxant potency of tetrazepam was inferior to that of diazepam, but was clearly superior to that of chlormezanone and mephenesin. Baclofen was less active than tetrazepam in 3 tests (traction, horizontal grid, and grip strength), but more active in the other 3 tests. The administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 blocked the effects of tetrazepam and diazepam in 2 representative tests, morphine-induced Straub tail and the rotarod test, but did not modify the activities of the other centrally acting muscle relaxants in these same models. The selectivity ratio (ED50 rotarod or ED50 locomotor activity/ED50 in each muscle relaxant test) for tetrazepam was superior to that of diazepam and all the other muscle relaxant drugs examined. It is concluded that tetrazepam exerts its muscle relaxant activity by stimulating central BZD receptors, and presents the advantage of a wide dissociation between muscle relaxant and sedative potencies.", 
    "36": "The potency, selectivity and specificity of atipamezole [MPV-1248, 4-(2-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl)-1H-imidazole], as an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist was studied. In receptor binding studies [( 3H]-clonidine and [3H]-prazosin displacement) an alpha 2/alpha 1 selectivity ratio of 8526 was obtained for atipamezole, while idazoxan and yohimbine showed ratios of 27 and 40, respectively. Atipamezole had also about a 100 times higher affinity on alpha 2-adrenoceptors than the reference compounds. In the electrically stimulated prostatic portion of rat vas deferens, atipamezole showed potent competitive antagonistic activity against clonidine (pA2 8.6) and medetomidine (pA2 8.7) at presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. In the epididymal portion of the rat vas deferens, atipamezole had only weak competitive antagonistic activity against phenylephrine (pA2 5.0). In binding studies and studies with isolated organs, atipamezole had no effect on beta 1-, beta 2-, H1-, H2-, 5-HT1-, 5-HT2-, muscarine, DA2-, tryptamine, GABA, opiate and benzodiazepine receptors. In the pithed rat, atipamezole, like idazoxan, had partial alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor effects in addition to potent alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking activity. In mice, medetomidine-induced sedation was effectively antagonized by atipamezole. These results show that atipamezole is a potent, selective and specific antagonist of both centrally and peripherally located alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "37": "The selective serotonin-1A receptor partial agonist anxiolytics represent a new class of pharmacologic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These compounds offer a completely different pharmacologic approach to this disorder from previous medications. The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) anxiolytics buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, and SM-3997 have several important new and unique features that will be reviewed in this paper. These features include no cross-tolerance with alcohol or benzodiazepines, no evidence of abuse or misuse potential, and no withdrawal symptoms or rebound anxiety on cessation of therapy. The 5-HT1A anxiolytics have no muscle relaxant, sedative, or anticonvulsant properties and do not impair psychomotor functioning. They do have a slower onset of effect than standard benzodiazepines-clinical response is usually noted in 1-3 weeks. The side effect profile is quite different from that of the benzodiazepines. It includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and restlessness. Some patients with GAD who have received chronic (greater than 1 month) benzodiazepine therapy may not respond as well to these compounds initially as will patients with no prior benzodiazepine treatment, especially if the benzodiazepine has been discontinued only recently. These compounds, buspirone in particular, have been shown to have excellent maintenance and prophylactic properties and to be well tolerated with long-term therapy (greater than 3 months). Because of their unique mechanism of action and side effect profile, and no evidence of misuse or abuse potential or interference with mental acuity, these compounds represent a definite advance in the pharmacologic management of GAD.", 
    "38": "In examining anxiety and the response of animal models to serotonergic drugs, four aspects should be taken into account: (1) the serotonin receptor is subdivided into at least six receptor subtypes; (2) benzodiazepines have acute anxiety-relieving effects, whereas antidepressants, serotonin-uptake inhibitors, buspirone, and serotonin antagonists have antianxiety effects only after prolonged administration; (3) diagnostic criteria differentiate several distinguishable anxiety disorders that have different responsiveness to serotonin-related drugs, and (4) various types of animal models exist, each responding differently to serotonin-related drugs. Perhaps particular animal models are relevant only for the study of one particular type of anxiety disorder. This differentiated view will be used when discussing the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes in anxiety disorders and anxiety models. The 5-HT1A receptor is implicated in anxiety by the compounds buspirone and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-aminotetraline) (OHDPAT). The 5-HT1B or the 5-HT1D receptors play a role in the 'defensive burying' anxiety model and probably mediate antidepressant and antianxiety effects of serotonin-uptake inhibitors. The 5-HT1C receptor plays a role in the aversive brain stimulation anxiety model and could play a role in antianxiety effects of mianserin. The 5-HT2 receptor is selectively blocked by ritanserin. In animal 'conflict models' for anxiety, 5-HT-2-receptor antagonists are active, although they are weaker than the benzodiazepines. The 5-HT3-receptor antagonists are reported to be active in social interaction models for anxiety; however, clinical experience in anxiety using these compounds is not yet available.", 
    "39": "In order to elucidate the role of the amygdala in rat conflict behavior in a water lick suppression test, we examined the effect of lesions of various nuclei of the amygdaloid complex on this behavior. An anticonflict effect was produced by a lesion of the anterior part of central and basolateral amygdala, and lesion to the posterior part of the central amygdala, but not by posterior of the basolateral amygdala or medial amygdala lesions. These results suggest that the amygdala, especially the anterior part of the central and basolateral nuclei, plays an important role in conflicting behavior of rats in the water lick test. In a second experiment, the effects of benzodiazepine- and GABA-antagonists on the anticonflict action of diazepam, zopiclone, and phenobarbital injected into the anterior part of central and basolateral amygdala were examined, also using a water lick suppression test. A dose-dependent anticonflict action was produced by systemic administration as well as by intra-amygdala injection of diazepam, zopiclone, lormetazepam, flurazepam and phenobarbital. The order of potency was lormetazepam greater than zopiclone greater than or equal to diazepam greater than flurazepam greater than or equal to phenobarbital for both routes of injection. The anticonflict effects of diazepam and zopiclone injected into the amygdala were completely reversed by Ro15-1788 and beta-CCM but not by bicuculline, while the anticonflict effect of phenobarbital was reversed by beta-CCM but not by Ro15-1788 or bicuculline. The present results strongly suggest that the anterior nuclei of central and basolateral amygdala are important sites of action of antianxiety drugs, and that an anticonflict action produced by intra-amygdala injection of benzodiazepines or barbiturate is mediated through the different receptor mechanisms.", 
    "40": "In drug discrimination studies benzodiazepine-trained animals have typically responded on the drug lever when tested with barbiturates. In a recent study, greater specificity appeared to be shown when lorazepam was used as a training drug. The generality and limits of this finding were explored in the present set of experiments. The asymmetrical cross-generalization found in lorazepam- and pentobarbital-trained baboons was replicated in rats and was shown not to be a function of either lorazepam (0.1., 0.32, or 1.0 mg/kg) or pentobarbital (10 or 25 mg/kg) training dose (i.e., pentobarbital-trained rats responded on the drug lever in tests with lorazepam, but lorazepam-trained rats did not show comparable pentobarbital generalization). In the next experiment, groups of rats were trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), triazolam (0.1 mg/kg), or diazepam (1.0 mg/kg). Generalization to both lorazepam and pentobarbital was shown by these rats. Finally after daily pentobarbital administration, lorazepam-trained rats made a sufficient number of responses after high pentobarbital doses to permit extension of the range of pentobarbital doses tested. Pentobarbital generalization increased, but still did not occur in all rats and was unreliable in successive tests in the same rats. These results suggest less homogeneity in the discriminative stimulus effects of \"depressant drugs\" than generally has been recognized.", 
    "41": "Rats (N = 12) were trained to discriminate midazolam (1 mg/kg, IP) from vehicle in a food reinforced operant conditioning procedure. Midazolam, flunitrazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital showed dose-dependent substitution for midazolam. Buspirone and Ro 15-1788 did not substitute for midazolam. The midazolam cue was dose-dependently antagonized by Ro 15-1788. In rats (N = 12) trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (3 mg/kg, IP) from vehicle midazolam, flunitrazepam, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide substituted completely and dose dependently for chlordiazepoxide. The relative potency of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam was three times less in the midazolam-trained animals than in the chlordiazepoxide-trained animals. Response rate and latency data further support the main finding that the midazolam cue is similar, but not identical to the cue of classical benzodiazepines.", 
    "42": "We examined the anxiolytic effects of a variety of anti-depressant drugs, administered either acutely or chronically, in an animal model of anxiety involving novelty-suppressed feeding in food-deprived rats. Following a single injection of desipramine (10 mg/kg) amitriptyline (10 mg/kg), mianserin (10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), buspirone (4 mg/kg), gepirone (4 mg/kg) or nomifensine (10 mg/kg), there was no decrease in the latency to begin eating in the novel environment such as occurred with diazepam (2 mg/kg). In fact, an increased latency was observed for desipramine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, and nomifensine. In contrast, chronic (21 days) treatment with each of the above-mentioned drugs, except nomifensine, significantly reduced the latency to begin eating relative to vehicle controls. These findings suggest that a variety of tricyclic and novel anti-depressant drugs acquire anxiolytic properties following chronic administration.", 
    "43": "The recognition of an unfamiliar juvenile rat by an adult rat has been shown to imply short-term memory processes. In this study the effect of various psychotropic drugs on this investigatory behaviour was examined. The procedure was as follows: an unfamiliar juvenile rat was placed in the home cage of an adult rat for 5 min. The time spent by the adult rat in investigating the juvenile was recorded. The adult rat was then immediately treated with vehicle or test compounds, and was again exposed for 5 min to the same juvenile 2 h later. At this time point vehicle-treated rats no longer recognized the juvenile rat, i.e. the time of investigation was similar to that observed during the first presentation. Arecoline (1 and 3 mg/kg IP), physostigmine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg SC), RS86 (0.5 mg/IP) and nicotine (0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg IP) reduced in a dose-dependent fashion the time spent in investigating the juvenile during the second exposure. This result cannot be attributed to nonspecific effects, since it was not observed when a different juvenile was used for the second exposure. The effect of arecoline was reversed by scopolamine, but not by methylscopolamine. Aniracetam reduced investigatory behaviour at the dose of 50 mg/kg IP. FG 7142 (5 mg/kg IP) and beta-CCM (0.4 mg/kg IP) were also active and their effect was reversed by Ro 15-1788. DL-Amphetamine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg IP), nomifensine (1.25-10 mg/kg IP) and strychnine (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg IP) were ineffective or reduced this behaviour unspecifically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The present study explored whether the profiles of action of benzodiazepines on intraspecies conflict behavior in mice are different. The occurrence of seven behavioral elements was observed in aggressive and timid singly-housed male mice treated with drugs in paired interactions with untreated non-aggressive males. At low doses, some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, oxazepam and diazepam) inhibited defenses, escapes, or attacks, but did not reduce other activities (social sniffing, walking, rearing), and actually increased most of them. At comparable doses, other benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, clonazepam and chlordiazepoxide) stimulated only social sniffing, but reduced rearing or walking. Further benzodiazepines (triazolam and lorazepam) reduced defenses, escapes and attacks only at doses that suppressed most of the remaining activities as well. Thus, the nine benzodiazepines tested exhibited different profiles of action in the present study. Alprazolam, oxazepam and diazepam appeared least sedative, while triazolam and lorazepam were most sedative.", 
    "45": "The pro-aggressive effects of low doses of benzodiazepines on maternal aggression in rats were studied. Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam and alprazolam produced bell-shaped dose-response curves, with increased aggression at low doses. Only alprazolam significantly reduced aggression at higher doses. A comparison of the drug effects on different aggressive elements revealed that chlordiazepoxide and oxazepam increased the frequency of more elements of the aggressive repertoire than diazepam or alprazolam. Thus, although all benzodiazepine receptor agonists increased aggression, there were significant quantitative differences in their effects.", 
    "46": "Opioids and benzodiazepines modulate the ultrasounds that rats emit before being presented with aversive stimulation. Mild, intermittent 10 s electrical tail stimulation induces rats to emit 20-30 kHz ultrasounds before and after the stimulation. Analysis of the temporal parameters of the sounds via a customized computer system reveals them to be emitted in bouts of about five sounds, each sound being separated from the next by 0.2-0.35 s pauses. Morphine decreases the per cent time vocalizing during the pre-stimulation period, with 6 mg/kg being fully suppressive. This effect is reversed by 1 mg/kg naloxone pre-treatment. Chlordiazepoxide and morphine have opposite effects on the temporal structure of the pre-stimulation calls; chlordiazepoxide induces longer bouts with more pulses, and morphine dissolves the bout structure into a series of single pulses. These differential and selective effects of morphine and benzodiazepines on the occurrence and temporal structure of ultrasounds may be relevant to characteristics of different affective expressions.", 
    "47": "Nine radiolytical products have been identified in a methanolic solution of Medazepam exposed to gamma-irradiation. A decomposition model taking into account these radiolytical products is presented. The formation of the individual radiolytical products can be deduced from analogous reactions of the radicals e-sdv., H, CH2OH, OH and HO2/O2- with several substances. Based on this knowledge of the radiochemical behaviour of Medazepam scavenger systems against radiolysis in solution can be developped.", 
    "48": "1. Using homogenates of supraoesophageal ganglia from locust we observed specific binding of [35S]-TBPS which was linear with protein concentration up to 7 mg/ml, showed a pH optimum at pH 9.0 and was linear with NaCl concentration up to 350 mM. 2. Kinetic analysis of the binding showed positive cooperativity as a result of changes in on and off-rates with occupation of the binding site by the ligand. The apparent KD = 417 nM and Bmax = 1083 fmol/mg of membrane protein were calculated using a computer program for dose-response curve fitting. 3. The binding was enhanced by GABA, pentobarbital and benzodiazepines. Picrotoxinin had no effect on the binding at 0.1 mM. Only the cage convulsants TBPS and IBP were able to displace the binding. 4. Whilst the characteristics of the binding are similar to those reported for house fly thorax and abdomen preparations they are significantly different from those reported for house fly head, cockroach nerve cord and rat brain.", 
    "49": "Low doses of ethanol increase responding for brain stimulation. Recently, other intoxicating effects of ethanol have been reversed by the imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro 15-4513. Possibly, Ro 15-4513 blockade also acts on reward-enhancing properties of ethanol. Rats trained to alternately shuttle between nose poke and lever operanda for rewarding stimulation to the medial forebrain bundle, were tested following intragastric intubations of ethanol (18%, 1.35 g/kg), Ro 15-4513 (3 mg/kg in 18% ethanol), or vehicle. Ro 15-4513 reversed ethanol-enhanced effects on reinforced responses. Because Ro 15-4513 did not completely block instrumental responding for brain stimulation, we conclude its effects on ethanol were not acting on the same reward substrate as the current and consummatory response.", 
    "50": "Loprazolam is a 1,4-benzodiazepine with hypnotics properties, useful for acute or chronic insomnia. His half-life of 7 to 8 hours in healthy adults, it may have advantages over benzodiazepines of short and longer-acting hypnotics. Although Loprazolam has been shown to have anti-anxiety, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects, a longer acting benzodiazepine may be more appropriate when this prolonged effects is desired. Loprazolam would appear how a effective hypnotic with minimal side effects, which come to cover a place between the benzodiazepines with short and long half-life.", 
    "51": "A battery of tests designed to elicit reactions to a variety of non-painful threat stimuli was used to study the effects of chlordiazepoxide (5-20 mg/kg), diazepam (1-5 mg/kg) and midazolam (1-10 mg/kg) on the defensive repertoire of wild Rattus rattus. The most consistent effect of benzodiazepine treatment, across compounds and tests, was a marked reduction in defensive threat and attack behaviors, with midazolam effective over a wider range of situations. In contrast, effects on freezing and flight reactions were more variable, differing substantially as a function of stimulus context. The general profile of observed changes in defense cannot be explained in terms of either non-specific behavioral suppression or a global reduction in defensiveness. Rather, our findings suggest that benzodiazepines may primarily induce a shift within the defense repertoire.", 
    "52": "The imidazo-diazepinone RO 16-6028 is a benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist which exhibits some anti-conflict effects in the two-chambered light/dark test without significantly affecting the behaviour of mice confronted with the staircase test. In addition, this drug slightly reduced locomotion and more markedly rearing in a free exploration procedure. These results indicate that RO 16-6028 appears to produce some anxiolytic and sedative properties like full agonists, but with weaker magnitude. This could be related to the benzodiazepine partial agonistic profile of the compound.", 
    "53": "A difference spectrophotometric procedure is described for the assay of nitrazepam in tablet formulations. The method is based on the measurement of absorbance at 282 nm of a solution of the tablet extract in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (pH 1) relative to that of an equimolar solution in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (pH 13). The method is precise and selective for nitrazepam in the presence of the tablet excipients and 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone, the principal hydrolysis product of nitrazepam. The absence of a constant isosbestic point in the difference spectrum of nitrazepam during hydrolysis in alkaline solution indicates the presence of a previously unrecognized intermediate hydrolysis product.", 
    "54": "A review of scientific and clinical evidence indicates: (1) benzodiazepines have an abuse liability and can cause physical dependence, (2) abuse liability is of a lower order of magnitude than that associated with common intoxicants such as barbiturates, opioids or stimulants, (3) sustained, exclusive use of benzodiazepines for inducing intoxication occurs but, it is infrequent, (4) benzodiazepines tend to be secondary drugs to a preferred primary intoxicant; in experimental paradigms normals prefer placebo to benzodiazepines, (5) susceptibility to physical dependence varies widely as low doses are sufficient to produce it in some but very high multiples are not sufficient to produce it in many others, (6) factors predisposing to physical dependence are: total lifetime dose, previous exposure to drugs cross-tolerant, such as alcohol or barbiturates, concomitant severe medical/psychiatric problems, and severe persisting stress. Individual susceptibility to abuse and to become dependent on benzodiazepines should be investigated much more vigorously than it has heretofore.", 
    "55": "A case of 17 year old female with acute benzodiazepines (800 mg of bentazepan and 400 mg de chlordiazepoxide) and tricyclic antidepressants (500 mg of imipramine) self poisoning is reported. Initial examination showed comatous patient (Glasgow coma scale 7, sedation scale 4) and a critical respiratory failure with a suspicious of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Supportive measures were started and flumazenil administered intravenous (0.1 mg/min) until a total dose of 1.2 mg; 15 minutes later neurological state was absolutely normal. We conclude that flumazenil is a selective and useful benzodiazepine antagonist in the treatment of acute benzodiazepine poisoning.", 
    "56": "The acute and subchronic effects of orally administered buspirone (acute: 15 mg; subchronic: 5 mg t.i.d.; Day 7:5 mg) and bromazepam (acute: 6 mg; subchronic: 2 mg t.i.d.; Day 7: 2 mg) on psychomotor and cognitive parameters were explored vs placebo in a randomized, double-blind crossover design with three periods in 12 healthy male volunteers. The washout periods between active treatments lasted one week. Psychomotor and cognitive measurements were taken with the Oculodynamic Text (ODT), which is a computerized psychophysiological online testing device for the simultaneous measurement of electrooculographic and performance (signal identification) parameters. Subjective side effects were recorded with a symptom checklist (41 items) with regard to the first and seventh day of administration. Intradiurnal assessments were done at 0, +1, +3, and +5 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 7 of each of the three randomized treatment periods. Buspirone behaved placebo-like in the EOG and signal-identification parameters after acute and subchronic administration. After bromazepam the respective parameters were significantly impaired--acutely as well as subchronically. Acute and subchronic buspirone was significantly superior to bromazepam with regard to the majority of psychophysiological parameters. The incidence of acute side effects was higher for both active treatments than for placebo. With buspirone there were fewer acute and subchronic side effects than with bromazepam. The side effect profiles of the three preparations were different. With regard to all active treatments the incidence of side effects was lower on Day 7 after the subchronic dosing period--with a third of the subchronic dose--than after the first single administration.", 
    "57": "The effect of adding bromazepam to treatment of duodenal ulcer with ranitidine was investigated in 30 out-patients. Under double-blind conditions one group of 15 patients received, for 14 days, 300 mg ranitidine and 6 mg bromazepam in the evening as a single dose. The other group received the same dose of ranitidine together with placebo, also for 14 days. In addition to measurements of gastric acid secretion after fasting and following histamine provocation, psychological ratings (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Zung Self-Assessment Scale for Anxiety) were carried out. Basal acid secretion was the same in both groups. During treatment, maximal acid output was significantly lower in the group of patients taking bromazepam than in those taking placebo. Similarly, significant differences were seen in favour of bromazepam in the psychological tests. It is concluded that these results confirm that bromazepam exerts a significant influence on acidity, over and above the effect of ranitidine. This effect, in all probability, is modulated by the emotional environment of individuals.", 
    "58": "The present review discusses the available data on the kinetic properties of non-opiate abused drugs including psychomotor stimulants, hallucinogens and CNS-depressants. Some of the drugs of abuse reviewed here are illicit drugs (e.g. cannabis, cocaine), while others are effective pharmacological agents but have the potential to be abused (e.g. benzodiazepines). Although some of the drugs mentioned in this review have been in use for centuries (e.g. caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, cannabis), knowledge of their kinetics and metabolism is very recent and in some cases still incomplete. This is partially due to the difficulties inherent in studying drugs of abuse in humans, and to the complex metabolism of some of these drugs (e.g. cannabis, caffeine) which has made it difficult to develop sensitive assays to determine biological pathways. Although drugs of abuse may have entirely different intrinsic pharmacological effects, the kinetic properties of such drugs are factors contributing to abuse and dependence. The pharmacokinetic properties that presumably contribute to self-administration and drug abuse include rapid delivery of the drug into the central nervous system and high free drug clearance. Kinetic characteristics also play an important role in the development of physical dependence and on the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome: the longer the half-life, the greater the likelihood of the development of physical dependence; the shorter the half-life, the earlier and more severe the withdrawal. The balance between these 2 factors, which has not yet been carefully studied, will also influence abuse patterns. The clinical significance of kinetic characteristics with respect to abuse is discussed where possible.", 
    "59": "This chapter comprises three sections that cover the main aspects of benzodiazepines and alcohol: (1) the basic pharmacology of benzodiazepines; (2) use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of withdrawal; and (3) the use of benzodiazepines in treating alcoholics. The basic studies suggest that a major site of action of alcohol may be the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex and that compensatory alterations in this complex may underly withdrawal. In the section on alcohol withdrawal, interactions between the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, sympathetic nervous system, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are discussed. Use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are reviewed, including the possibility that the benzodiazepines may prevent withdrawal-induced \"kindling.\" Lastly, we review indications for, and efficacy of, benzodiazepines in long-term treatment of patients with alcoholism. Benzodiazepines are not indicated for the treatment of alcoholism. Furthermore, they have very few indications in alcoholics and their dependency-producing potency has to be appreciated when they are used in patients with alcoholism.", 
    "60": "The debrisoquine/sparteine phenotype was determined in 51 patients with depression, who were subdivided into 3 groups in terms of their drug treatment. Log (MR) for each group was compared. Patients treated with benzodiazepines had the same distribution of log (MR) as the healthy population, but the distribution was shifted towards higher values in patients treated with neuroleptics and antidepressants. It appears that the phenotypic expression of debrisoquine oxidation may be modified by drugs whose metabolism follows the same route as debrisoquine. The debrisoquine test must be carefully interpreted in patients receiving several drugs in the same time.", 
    "61": "The interaction of a highly potent and selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole with ethanol was investigated in tests assessing a number of ethanol's behavioral effects. Atipamezole antagonized ethanol's effects on directed exploration in a holeboard test, reduced observer-rated intoxication and also reduced the duration of loss of righting reflex caused by ethanol. Similar effects were produced by another alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan. The magnitude of the effects was comparable to that produced in the same animal models by the imidazodiazepine Ro 15-4513, which antagonizes ethanol by an action at central benzodiazepine receptors. Whereas Ro 15-4513 possesses marked behavioral effects on its own, atipamezole is comparatively inactive in all paradigms so far tested. The data suggest that alpha-2 adrenoceptors can play an important role in modulating the intoxicating effects of ethanol.", 
    "62": "CGS 20625 (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10-octa hydrocyclohepta[b]pyrazolo-[3,4-d]pyridin-3-one) is a potent and selective ligand for the central benzodiazepine receptor (IC50 = 1.3 nM), with little or no affinity to several other neurotransmitter receptor binding sites in vitro. CGS 20625 had a gamma-aminobutyric acid ratio of 0.9 and increased t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding by 20% in vitro, a profile indicative of a partial agonist or mixed agonist/antagonist. In vivo, CGS 20625 blocked a pentylenetetrazol discriminative cue with an ED50 = 1.7 mg/kg p.o. The compound selectively increased conflict responding in the Cook-Davidson paradigm with a minimal effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg p.o., as compared with 3.0 mg/kg p.o. for diazepam. At doses as high as 100 mg/kg p.o., CGS 20625 had no effect on variable interval responding, suggesting minimal sedation. Unlike diazepam, CGS 20625 had no effect on rotorod performance at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o. indicating no overt muscle relaxation, and did not potentiate the action of ethanol in this behavioral paradigm. Also, CGS 20625 had no marked effect on locomotor behavior, did not potentiate hexobarbital sleep time and had no sedative activity at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o. CGS 20625 was efficacious in preventing pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures (ED50 = 0.7 mg/kg p.o.), had less efficacy with no clear dose-response relationship against picrotoxin-induced seizures and had no effect on either strychnine or electroshock-induced convulsions at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Five pigeons were trained to discriminate injections of midazolam (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg i.m.) from saline with responding maintained under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food delivery. When other benzodiazepines were tested, they consistently produced greater than 80% of midazolam-appropriate responding. The order of potency for substituting for midazolam was triazolam greater than alprazolam = diazepam = lorazepam greater than midazolam greater than flurazepam = nitrazepam greater than nordiazepam. The barbiturate phenobarbital (10-100 mg/kg) substituted for midazolam in three of four pigeons whereas pentobarbital (1.0-30 mg/kg) substituted in only two of five pigeons. Several nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics were also evaluated. Methaqualone (3.0-56 mg/kg) substituted in only one of four pigeons and meprobamate (30-100 mg/kg) failed to substitute in any pigeon tested. CL 218,872, when administered either i.m. (0.3-30 mg/kg) or p.o. (1.0-56 mg/kg), and buspirone (0.3-30 mg/kg) did not substitute for midazolam. Compounds from pharmacological classes not related to midazolam also failed to substitute for midazolam. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; 0.03-1.0 mg/kg) antagonized the discriminative stimulus properties of midazolam in a dose-related manner in all pigeons tested. However, this antagonism could not be overcome with increasing doses of midazolam in all pigeons. The results of the present study demonstrate that midazolam is an effective discriminative stimulus in the pigeon. Benzodiazepine anxiolytics, but not other compounds with sedative and/or anxiolytic properties, were found to reliably substitute for midazolam. These results suggest that the discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam are pharmacologically selective.", 
    "64": "Eight children exposed in utero to benzodiazepines had characteristic dysmorphic features, growth aberrations, and central nervous system abnormalities from birth. Their dysmorphic characteristics resembled those of the fetal alcohol syndrome, although they had greater focal involvement of cranial nerves, with a sullen and expressionless face, and they more often had impairment of vitality at birth. One infant died and at autopsy had varying degrees of distortion of neuronal migration, with concomitant heterotopias. Five of the eight mothers had regularly consumed benzodiazepines, and the three remaining mothers had blood samples during pregnancy revealing benzodiazepine concentrations indicative of regular use. Our findings indicate that maternal consumption of benzodiazepines may be teratogenic in humans.", 
    "65": "Pure enantiomers of 3-substituted-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones, obtained by HPLC resolution on chiral stationary phases, show significant differences in their pharmacological activity. The occurrence of biotransformation during the pharmacological test is monitored using a new chromatographic method. The reliability of the pharmacological activity data is discussed.", 
    "66": "Research of the alcohol action mechanism on the SNC in acute alcoholic intoxication (AAI) has been dealt in various ways. On one side the alcohol action--apparently most unspecific--on cellular membranes has been studied. Other authors, instead, have studied more specific alcohol effects on three types of neurotransmitters: opioid peptides, GABA and catecholamines. The effect of alcohol on cellular membranes seems to be beyond any doubt. Alcohol action on specific neurotransmitters is the object of controversy, especially in the case of endogenous opioids. There are data which strongly support the participation of the GABA receptors in the AAI. Modifications produced in the cellular membrane by alcohol action can modify the structure of the function of the membrane receptors. On the other hand, distinct receptors may be localized in the same neuron, while the existence of interactions between different neurotransmitters is well known. Therefore, the various hypotheses previously stated are not mutually exclusive.", 
    "67": "The linking event between the activation of muscarinic M1 receptors and the stimulation of polyphosphoinositide (PPI) turnover was studied in rat brain synaptosomes from the muscarinic M1 enriched cerebrum and M2 enriched cerebellum. The muscarinic M1 selective antagonists, pirenzepine and trihexyphenidyl, and M2 selective antagonist AF-DX-116 were chosen to displace the non-selective labeled cholinergic ligand, 3H-QNB, binding to these two regions of the brain synaptosomes. The IC50 values obtained for these agents revealed a typical characterization of the receptor subtypes of these two regions as they are. Carbachol-induced a stimulation of the PPI turnover cycle: namely, a decrease in 32Pi incorporation into phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (TPI) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (DPI), and an increase in this incorporation into phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA) in rat brain synaptosomes from the cerebrum. However, this event was only barely detectable in the synaptosomes from the cerebellum. The IC50 values obtained for these antagonists to block the carbachol-induced PPI turnover cycle in the synaptosomes from the cerebrum were close to the values obtained for the displacement of 3H-QNB binding to the same preparation, and were far away from those values obtained in the synaptosomes from the cerebellum. Our results suggest that there is evidence to support the view that muscarinic M1 receptors are coupled to the PPI turnover event in rat cortical synaptosomes.", 
    "68": "The spectrum of neurological complications associated with heroin addiction has changed in the past six years because of the progressive knowledge of the neurological complications related to HIV infection. We reviewed 48 heroin addicts with neurological complications and 452 heroin overdose who were seen in the Emergency Unit of our hospital during 1988 and the publications since 1967. Regarding the overdose we present the results of a prospective study leading to determine the causes. We emphasize the relationship with the level of total morphine in serum, instead of conjugate morphine, and with the presence of high levels of benzodiazepines found in the plasma rather than an hypothetic hypersensitivity phenomenon. We resume the neurological complications related with heroin addiction: spongiform leukoencephalopathy, epileptic seizures, stroke, transverse myelopathy and neuromuscular complications such mononeuropathy, plexopathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, rhabdomyolysis, fibrosing myopathy, musculoskeletal syndrome and acute bacterial myopathy. Some of such complications (i.e. transverse myelitis, polyradiculoneuropathy, leucoencephalopathy) must rise the suspicion of an HIV infection. Likewise, in patients assisted for overdosage we believe it's necessary rule out myoglobinuria by means of CPK serum levels and detection of urine hematic pigments without red blood cels in the urine sediment, in order to prevent and treat the renal failure. We report the results of muscular biopsy found in the musculoskeletal syndrome, which are similar to those found in alcoholic myopathy. Finally, we describe the clinical and diagnostic aspects in an unusually neuromuscular complication: the acute bacterial myopathy.",

    "70": "Prenatal benzodiazepine administration has been associated with alterations in behavior in young and mature animals. Prior studies of neurochemical changes in animals treated in utero have produced conflicting results. We used a chick embryo system to assess the effects of chronic lorazepam administration on binding and function at the GABAA receptor in late embryos and in mature animals. Administration of lorazepam for 10 days of embryonic development (E8-E18) led to decreases in binding of the chloride channel ligand TBPS and in muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake in late embryos (E18). Similar alterations were observed in mature animals after the same regimen of prenatal lorazepam. Persistent alterations in GABAA receptor binding and function after prenatal lorazepam may be due to effects of neuronal differentiation or on receptor regulation. These neurochemical effects may underlie the behavioral abnormalities associated with prenatal benzodiazepine administration.", 
    "71": "Treatment of time-pregnant Long Evans rats with 1.25 mg/kg s.c. diazepam (2.5 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats) from gestational day 14 to 20 produced transient depression of an olfactory guided behavior (nest odor behavior) in suckling offspring. Enhanced drug sensitivity to diazepam was seen in adult male and female off-spring as indicated by increased temperature depression. In addition, increased sensitivity to an opiate (morphine) was noted for the female offspring in the tail flick test. Treatment of the pregnant dam with diazepam or clonazepam, a benzodiazepine with selective affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor, resulted in a marked depression of cellular immune responses in the offspring of both sexes up to 2 months of age. Drug treatment during early fetal period (GD 12-16), at a time central benzodiazepine receptors are not present in all brain regions of the fetal brain, did not affect the quality of cellular immune responses, whereas treatment from GD 16 to 20 was effective. Prenatal diazepam effects are discussed in view of presence and functionality of both central and peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the fetus.", 
    "72": "Recently, [123I]Ro16-0154 has been introduced as a potential benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor imaging tracer for SPECT. We investigated the biodistribution of [123I]Ro16-0154 in humans and compared it with the animal data. There was a rapid and high 123I-uptake in the brain comparable to rCBF. In the following images, however, regionally different changes were observed, resulting in a subsequent intracerebral retention parallel to the known distribution of BZD receptors. The results suggest that [123I]Ro16-0154 is of potential clinical use as a BZD receptor imaging agent.", 
    "73": "The olivocochlear innervation has been postulated to regulate active mechanical processes in the mammalian cochlea. Histochemical studies led to the suggestion that a subpopulation of these efferent nerves, which predominantly terminate on outer hair cells (OHCs), are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic. By means of two monoclonal antibodies, we were able to visualize GABAA-receptor immunoreactivity at the basal pole of isolated sensory cells. Both subunits of the GABAA receptor, the alpha- and beta-subunit, are known to form the transmembranous GABA/benzodiazepine-receptor complex and were present on OHCs. In addition, these inhibitory receptors were more numerous in the apical turns of the cochlea, indicating another criterion for distinguishing the apical from basal turns of the cochlea. These results support the concept that a subpopulation of axosomatic synapses at the basal pole of OHCs liberate the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA into the synaptic cleft. Binding of the transmitter to these newly observed subsynaptic receptors is possibly followed by a change in OHC motility and a subsequent modulation of the movement of the basilar membrane.", 
    "74": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding sites were studied by using 3H-diazepam and 3H-Ro 5-4864 in intact lymphocytes from peripheral blood (PBL), in comparison to kidney and cerebellum. Experiments with 3H-diazepam performed at equilibrium and measuring kinetics revealed that BDZ binding sites are indeed present in rat PBL. The binding is saturable (Bmax 557 fmoles/10(6) cells), with high affinity (KD = 9.3 nM) and reversible. Specific binding sites are also observed by saturation experiments with 3H-Ro 5-4864 (Bmax 175 fmoles/10(6) cells, KD 2.2 nM). In addition, analysis of saturation isotherms obtained with 3H-diazepam indicates that BDZ binding sites are also present in human PBL. Scatchard plot of binding isotherms revealed an apparent single population of sites in all cases. The pharmacological characterization of BDZ binding sites in PBL, as compared with those of kidney and cerebellum, showed that these sites belong to the so-called \"peripheral type.\"", 
    "75": "Lorazepam (LZ), a benzodiazepine group of drug, inhibits Mg2+ and (Na+,K+) ATPases (EC 3.6.1.3) activity of human foetal and adult brain. The inhibitory effect neither varied with respect to the region (i.e. cerebrum and cerebellum) nor with the age of the foetus. The inhibition of ATPases activity indicates that the neuronal transmission processes, may be affected and raises the possibility of developmental disturbances.", 
    "76": "The in vitro quantitative autoradiographic technique was used to characterize the distributions of alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic, D1 and D2 dopaminergic, 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 serotonergic, M1 and M2 cholinergic, GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors in the motor (Brodmann's area 4) and somatosensory (Brodmann's areas 3, 1 and 2) cortex of the adult rhesus monkey. All receptor subtypes studied were present throughout all layers of both areas. In the somatosensory cortex, each receptor had its own laminar distribution. Some subtypes of the same receptor (5-HT1 and 5-HT2; alpha 1 and alpha 2) had complementary distributions while others (beta 1 and beta 2; D1 and D2; M1 and M2) had largely overlapping distributions. In contrast, different receptors had remarkably coincidental distributions in the motor cortex. In this area, they all tended to concentrate in layers I, II and the upper part of layer III. However, such coextensive distribution of many types of neurotransmitter receptors is not observed in motor cortex of rats and humans and therefore may be a distinctive feature of motor cortex in the rhesus monkey. The findings described in this paper indicate that somatosensory and motor areas are distinct in their receptor architecture and that receptor autoradiography provides a useful complement to classical histological techniques in elucidating areal differences in the cortex.", 
    "77": "Amoxapine inhibits GABA-stimulated chloride conductance by acting on the GABAA-receptor chloride-ionophore complex which can be studied using membrane vesicles prepared from rat cerebral cortex. Amoxapine produces a right shift in the GABA concentration-response curve for the stimulation of 36Cl- uptake into these vesicles with no apparent change in the maximum response. Schild analysis of these data gave a pA2 value of 5.52 with a slope of 0.79. Amoxapine inhibits the binding of the GABAA receptor selective antagonist [3H]SR 95531 with an IC50 value of 3.45 microM and a pseudo Hill coefficient of 0.83. In contrast, 10 microM amoxapine inhibits [3H]flunitrazepam binding by less than 25% while the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 reduces the amoxapine inhibition of GABA-stimulated chloride conductance only at high concentrations. These data suggest that amoxapine does not inhibit chloride conductance by acting as a benzodiazepine inverse agonist and either acts directly on the GABAA receptor as an antagonist or blocks GABA activity at a site closely coupled to it. The ability of amoxapine to inhibit GABA-stimulated chloride conductance is a likely explanation for its proconvulsant activity observed at high doses.", 
    "78": "Alprazolam, a novel benzodiazepine derivative is thought to be effective in the treatment of anxiety, panic, and depressive disorders. There is considerable interest in alprazolam's mechanism of action, particularly whether its profile of actions might resemble that of the alpha 2 adrenoreceptor agonist, clonidine. The present study assessed the biochemical, cardiovascular, and behavioral responses of healthy volunteers to acute intravenous infusions of alprazolam and placebo. Alprazolam reduced ACTH and cortisol while increasing growth hormone. There was a transient reduction in plasma norepinephrine and only modest effects on cardiovascular parameters. Subjects became quite sedated after intravenous alprazolam. This pharmacodynamic profile resembles that previously reported for traditional benzodiazepines, although alprazolam may be a more potent stimulator of growth hormone release. Alprazolam's effects on growth hormone resemble those of clonidine, but unlike clonidine, alprazolam has relatively little effect on plasma catecholamine and cardiovascular parameters. This suggests that alpha 2 mechanisms do not play a primary role in alprazolam's mode of action. Since alprazolam infusion affects three different measures (ACTH/cortisol, growth hormone, and plasma norepinephrine) thought to be dysregulated in depression, challenge with intravenous alprazolam may prove to be a useful \"probe\" in affective disorders.", 
    "79": "The effect of various detergents treatment on the specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 (2nM) to peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) in calf and rat kidney, adrenal gland, and cerebral cortex membranes was studied. At a concentration of 0.025%, Triton X-100 increased [3H]PK 11195 specific binding to calf kidney, adrenal gland, and cerebral cortex membranes by 20-40%. At the same concentration, Triton X-100 scarcely affected specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 to rat cerebral cortex but decreased binding to rat kidney and adrenal gland membranes by 20-30%. At a concentration of 0.05% of Triton X-100, [3H]PK 11195 specific binding to calf kidney, adrenal gland, and cerebral cortex membranes was increased by 10-20%; whereas [3H]PK 11195 specific binding to rat kidney, adrenal gland, and cerebral cortex membranes was decreased by more than 40%. The increase in [3H]PK 11195 specific binding to calf kidney membranes following Triton X-100 (0.05%) treatment was apparently due to an increase in the binding affinity of PBS, since the density remained unaltered; whereas, the decrease in [3H]PK 11195 specific binding to rat kidney membranes was due to a decrease in both binding affinity and density of PBS. On the other hand, the detergents 3- [(3- cholamidopropyl)- dimethylammonio] - 1 - propane sulfonate (CHAPS), Tween 20, deoxycholic acid, and digitonin have a similar effect on [3H]PK 11195 specific binding to PBS in both calf and rat kidney membranes.", 
    "80": "1. Dissociation constants and Hill coefficients were determined for 13 ligands inhibiting the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepine receptors of guinea pig hippocampus at 2 degrees C and 37 degrees C. 2. The ratio of I50 in the absence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to that in the presence of 10(-5) M GABA (the GABA-shift) was found to vary from 0.4 to 2.5. 3. There was no correlation between the pharmacological activity of the ligand and the GABA-shift, or between the pharmacological activity and the magnitude of the increase in affinity of the ligand for the receptor as the temperature decreased from 37 degrees C to 2 degrees C. 4. A correlation was observed between the temperature-induced affinity change and the GABA-shift at 37 degrees C."
