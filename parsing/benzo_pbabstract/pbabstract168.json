Forty piglets aged 4 to 7 days were randomly assigned to receive a mixture of ketamine 15 mg kg-1, climazolam 1.5 mg kg-1 and azaperone 1.0 mg kg-1, IN or IM, 10 minutes prior to castration. Physiological parameters were measured. Castration was videotaped for evaluation by 3 independent observers using a scoring system. Reaction and vocalization to the skin incision and cutting of spermatic cord was evaluated and scored (0 = no reaction, 16 = strong reaction). The IN group had a significantly higher (P < 0.01) castration score, compared to the IM group. There was an association between castration score and room temperature in the IN group (with temperatures below 18 \"C associated with a higher castration scores (P < 0.001). Heart rate was significantly higher 10 minutes after castration in the IN group (P < 0.05). Respiratory rate was significantly higher in the IM group at time points -5, -1, 10, 20 and 30 (P < 0.05). The IN group was walking significantly (P < 0.0001) faster than the IM group. In conclusion, this combination provides effective anaesthesia for routine castration of newborn piglets when administered IM. IN administration provided shorter recovery times but had significantly higher castration scores.", 
    "1": "A single-tissue compartment model with plasma input is the established method for analysing [(11)C]flumazenil ([(11)C]FMZ) studies. However, arterial cannulation and measurement of metabolites are time-consuming. Therefore, a reference tissue approach is appealing, but this approach has not been fully validated for [(11)C]FMZ. Dynamic [(11)C]FMZ positron emission tomography scans with arterial blood sampling were performed in nine drug-free depressive patients and eight healthy subjects. Regions of interest were defined on co-registered magnetic resonance imaging scans and projected onto dynamic [(11)C]FMZ images. Using a Hill-type metabolite function, single (1T) and reversible two-tissue (2T) compartmental models were compared. Simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and full reference tissue model (FRTM) were investigated using both pons and (centrum semiovale) white matter as reference tissue. The 2T model provided the best fit in 59% of cases. Two-tissue V(T) values were on average 1.6% higher than 1T V(T) values. Owing to the higher rejection rate of 2T fits (7.3%), the 1T model was selected as plasma input method of choice. SRTM was superior to FRTM, irrespective whether pons or white matter was used as reference tissue. BP(ND) values obtained with SRTM correlated strongly with 1T V(T) (r=0.998 and 0.995 for pons and white matter, respectively). Use of white matter as reference tissue resulted in 5.5% rejected fits, primarily in areas with intermediate receptor density. No fits were rejected using pons as reference tissue. Pons produced 23% higher BP(ND) values than white matter. In conclusion, for most clinical studies, SRTM with pons as reference tissue can be used for quantifying [(11)C]FMZ binding.", 
    "2": "The anticholinergic propiverine (1-methyl-4-piperidyl diphenylpropoxyacetate), which is used for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome, has functionally active metabolites [M-1 (1-methyl-4-piperidyl diphenylpropoxyacetate N-oxide) and M-2 (1-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate N-oxide)], but the site of actions of these metabolites is uncertain. Propiverine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is extensively biotransformed in the liver, giving rise to several active metabolites (M-1 and M-2). This study determines the effect of M-1 and M-2 on voltage-dependent nifedipine-sensitive inward Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca)) using patch-clamp techniques and fluorescent Ca(2+) imaging [after electrical field stimulation (EFS) and acetylcholine (ACh)] in the murine urinary bladder. In conventional whole-cell recording, propiverine and M-1 but not M-2 inhibited the peak amplitude of I(Ca) in a concentration-dependent manner at a holding potential of -60 mV (propiverine, K(i) = 10 microM; M-1, K(i) = 118 microM). M-1 shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ca) to the left at -90 mV by 7 mV. Carbachol (CCh) reversibly inhibited I(Ca). This inhibition probably occurred through muscarinic type 3 receptors, coupling with G-proteins, because nanomolar concentrations of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine greatly reduced this inhibition, whereas pirenzepine or 11-([2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperdinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) at concentrations up to 1 microM was almost ineffective. In the presence of M-2, the CCh-induced inhibition of I(Ca) was blocked. In fluorescent Ca(2+) imaging, M-2 inhibited EFS-induced and ACh-induced Ca(2+) transients. These results suggest that M-1 acts, at least in part, as a Ca(2+) channel antagonist (as it inhibited I(Ca)), whereas M-2 has more direct antimuscarinic actions.", 
    "3": "Glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are major excitatory and inhibitory retinal neurotransmitters. The balance between these signals is a key principle of organization at retinal level. Although glutamate-induced excitotoxicity could mediate retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma, the GABAergic system was not previously examined in this disease. The aim of this work was to study the retinal GABAergic activity in eyes with ocular hypertension induced by hyaluronic acid (HA). For this purpose, weekly injections of HA were performed unilaterally in the rat anterior chamber, whereas the contralateral eye was injected with saline solution. At 3 weeks of treatment with HA, GABA turnover rate, glutamic acid decarboxylase activity, and both glutamate- and high K(+)-induced GABA release significantly decreased, whereas GABA uptake increased in HA-treated eyes. The binding of t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to GABA(A)/benzodiazepine Cl(-) channels significantly increased in eyes injected with HA as compared with vehicle-injected eyes. Changes in GABA uptake and TBPS binding persisted at 6 weeks of treatment with HA. These results indicate a dysfunction of the retinal GABAergic activity in hypertensive eyes, which could suggest the involvement of GABA in glaucomatous neuropathy.", 
    "4": "Neo-natal rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when isolated from their mothers and littermates. Clinically effective anxiolytics reliably reduce USVs, making this behavior a useful animal model of the anxiolytic potential of novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of anxiety. Here, we assess the hypothesis that USV duration (total time spent vocalizing) is a more sensitive measure of anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacy than USV number by testing established and putative anxiolytics in this model. Negative geotaxis and righting reflex latency were measured to assess sedating properties. The benzodiazepines, CDP (1-10 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg), the 5HT(1A) partial agonist, buspirone (0.3-3 mg/kg), and the mGluR5 antagonist, MTEP (1-30 mg/kg), reduced USV duration at lower doses and to a greater magnitude than USV number. The benzodiazepines, unlike buspirone and MTEP, produced measurable sedation, but it was dissociable from reductions in USV duration. The SSRI antidepressants, fluoxetine (1-30 mg/kg) and citalopram (0.3-30 mg/kg), reduced USV duration more than number with no measurable effect on sedation. The tricyclic antidepressants, imipramine (1-10 mg/kg) and amitriptyline (1-30 mg/kg), had no effect dissociable from sedation. These data support USV duration as a more sensitive and useful measure than USV number in the isolated rat pup model.",

    "9": "The global use of benzodiazepines and cyclopyrrolones is generally high. The hypnotic and anxiolytic effects of these agents typically diminish after a period of weeks or months of continuous use. Patients may thus be caught in a trap where the usefulness of these substances is reduced and doses are consequentially escalated, and where a subsequent phased reduction in dose can be difficult. Although considerable resources have been expended on reducing the use of these agents, no unambiguous and effective method has been identified.In Denmark, it is estimated that there are approximately 100 000 benzodiazepine-dependent patients, constituting approximately 2% of the general population. The prescription of dependency-producing drugs (including benzodiazepine/cyclopyrrolone agents) in Denmark is regulated according to Danish directive CIR nr 12, introduced on 13 January 2003, which aimed for restrictions in the prescribing of benzodiazepine and cyclopyrrolone drugs while setting revised guidelines for the re-evaluation of these agents. However, by 2004, the use of these drugs had decreased by only 1.7%, far from the official objective of a 50% reduction. This article describes an effective strategy implemented in general practice in Denmark to reduce the use of benzodiazepine and cyclopyrrolone agents, while at the same time challenging practitioners' ingrained habits and prejudices in this field.", 
    "10": "An intervention involving new regulations for the prescription of benzodiazepines and cyclopyrrolones was introduced to ten Danish medical practices, comprising 13 medical practitioners and a patient base of approximately 18 500 patients. The new intervention was essentially in accordance with the official Danish regulations, such that a prescription for benzodiazepines and cyclopyrrolones could only be issued for 1 month at a time, and only following consultation. Telephone prescriptions were eliminated. Use was monitored using the Danish registration system, Ordiprax, which monitors sales of prescription medicine. All users of benzodiazepines and cyclopyrrolones within the ten practices, with the exception of seriously psychiatrically and physically ill patients, were included.", 
    "11": "Fifteen months after the inception of the intervention, the use of cyclopyrrolones was reduced by 50.3%. Use of benzodiazepine-hypnotics was reduced by 46.5% and use of benzodiazepine-anxiolytics was reduced by 41.7%. The reorganisation of prescription patterns proved to be significantly easier than practitioners had expected. During the first 3 months, only 4.3 additional consultations per week per 1000 patients were required. Subsequently, this number fell to 2.1 additional consultations. The usual collaborative partners, such as psychiatrists, homecare services, hospitals and substance abuse units, were essentially not deployed. No serious side effects developed in patients in whom drug use was reduced.",

Replacement of the amide of VIII with an amidine moiety gave the 5-amino-2-phenyl[1,2,3]triazolo[1,2-a][1,2,4]benzotriazin-1-ones IX, which maintain a nanomolar potency at the A3 AR with selectivity over the BzR. Insertion of a p-methoxybenzoyl at the 5-amino moiety enhanced A3 AR affinity and selectivity over the A1, A2A, and A2B ARs. The best result of our lead optimization efforts is 9-chloro-5-(4-methoxybenzoyl)amino-2-phenyl[1,2,3]triazolo[1,2-a][1,2,4]benzotriazin-1-one (23), which displayed a Ki of 1.6 nM at the A3 AR and no significant affinity at the other ARs or the BzR.

Classical anticholinergic syndrome should be readily diagnosed by the experienced clinician ('hot as a hare, red as a beet, dry as a bone, blind as a bat and mad as a hatter'). Acute presentations should be treated with benzodiazepines and supportive care. Treatment of the delirium with haloperidol may be harmful. Lack of familiarity with anticholinergic syndrome may also delay the diagnosis or result in potentially harmful treatments.

Research on cannabis is especially lacking, given that worldwide it is the most commonly used illicit drug in schizophrenia, is used at higher rates in schizophrenia than in the general population, and makes its own unique contribution to the onset and prognosis of schizophrenia. In the present paper an overview of the neuropsychology literature on substance use in schizophrenia is presented, with special emphasis on cannabis.

All drugs with proven antipsychotic effects block dopamine D(2) receptors to some degree. The ongoing development of the dopamine and other neurotransmitter receptor systems during childhood and adolescence may affect clinical response and susceptibility to side effects in youth. A literature search was conducted of clinical trials of antipsychotics in children and adolescents with EOSS disorders between 1980 and 2007 from the Medline database, reference lists, and conference proceedings. Trials were limited to double-blind studies of duration of 4 or more weeks that included 15 or more patients. Ten clinical trials were identified. Antipsychotic medications were consistently found to reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms in children and adolescents when compared with placebo. The superiority of clozapine has been now demonstrated relative to haloperidol, standard-dose olanzapine, and \"high-dose\" olanzapine for EOSS disorders. However, limited comparative data are available regarding whether there are differences among the remaining second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in clinical effectiveness. The available data from short-term studies suggest that youth might be more sensitive than adults to developing antipsychotic-related adverse side effects (eg, extrapyramidal side effects, sedation, prolactin elevation, weight gain). In addition, preliminary data suggest that SGA use can lead to the development of diabetes in some youth, a disease which itself carries with it significant morbidity and mortality. Such a substantial risk points to the urgent need to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or mitigate weight gain and diabetes early in the course of treatment in this population.",

Methamphetamine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450s, the latter also being involved in the metabolism of many drugs and other xenobiotics. The effect of methamphetamine pretreatment (10 mg kg-1, intraperitoneally once daily for 6 days) on the activity of the P450 enzymes was assessed both in the rat isolated perfused liver and in vivo. The rate of 4-hydroxydiclofenac production was significantly enhanced in vivo, indicating a possible stimulatory effect on P4502C6. Similarly, the kinetics of tolbutamide and dextromethorphan in isolated perfused rat liver indicate a significant increase in both P4502C6 and the P4502D subfamily. No significant changes in midazolam kinetic in the isolated perfused rat liver were observed. The potential for methamphetamine to cause drug interactions is of clinical relevance and, therefore, it warrants further investigation. Until further drug interaction experiments are accomplished, the co-administration of drugs with methamphetamine should be conducted with caution.",

The effects of the discharge of diazepam (DZP) suppositories from the rectum on the plasma DZP concentration and its anticonvulsant action were investigated in rats. The plasma DZP concentration reached a maximum at approx. 30 min after the rectal administration of a 5 mg/kg DZP suppository. The discharge of the DZP suppository from the rectum at 5 or 10 min after rectal administration significantly reduced the plasma DZP concentration and the anticonvulsant action of the DZP suppository against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. However, when the suppository was discharged from the rectum after 20 min, the plasma DZP concentration and the anticonvulsant action were only slightly but not significantly decreased. These results suggest that the discharge of the DZP suppository in the early phase, within 20 min, decreases the plasma concentration and the anticonvulsant action of the DZP suppository in rats. Therefore, when the suppository is discharged from the rectum immediately, sufficient observation and proper treatment are necessary.",

The serotoninergic systems has been analyzed. Quantitative data were calculated by inner standart method. Oxidazed forms of Midazolam were qualitatively and quantitatively identified. Our data proved the ability of Midazolam to adsorb on the albumin and globulin fraction of plasma. Metabolism of serotonin and triptopchan is closely dependent on the concentration of psychotropic drug. Concentration of aminoacids (triptophan, tirosyn) in the blood is synshronized with the course of pharmacokinetic of the psychotropic preparation and functional state of serotoninergic system. Alterations may be due, on the one hand, to exhaustion of the stores, and on the other hand, to deterioration of the monoamines' synthesis process. The investigation of pharmacokinetics of invariable form of Midazolam and its oxidized metabolits is very important for practical medicine. Effective action of pshychotropic drugs is impossible without extensive knowlege of their phramacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. They are concerned with the need to dermine concentration in body fluids.",

Data from 51 drugs were collected; 41 of them are still in the market. Of the 51 drugs, 12 (23.5%) do not have retrievable genotoxicity or carcinogenicity data. The remaining 39 (76.5%) have at least one genotoxicity or carcinogenicity test result. Of these 39, 12 (30.8%) have at least one positive finding: 9 tested positive in at least one genotoxicity assay, 8 in at least one carcinogenicity assay, and 5 gave a positive result in both at least one genotoxicity assay and at least one carcinogenicity assay. In terms of correlation between results of the various genotoxicity assays and absence of carcinogenic activity in mice and/or rats or in other species, none of the 11 non-carcinogenic drugs tested positive in one of the various genotoxicity assay systems. Concerning the predictivity of genetic toxicology findings for the result(s) of long-term carcinogenesis assays, 18 drugs had both genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data; of these 11 (61.1%) were neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic, 2 (11.1%) were carcinogenic in at least one sex of mice or rats but tested negative in genotoxicity assays, and 5 (27.8%) gave a positive response in at least one genotoxicity assay and in at least one carcinogenicity assay. Only 8 (19.5%) of the 41 marketed benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine analogues had all data required by current guidelines for testing of pharmaceuticals.",

Since the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is abundant on brain macrophages, we hypothesized that [(3)H]DAA1106, a new PBR ligand, can label infected and activated brain macrophages in HIVE. Using cell culture and postmortem brain tissues from HIVE and a macaque model of HIVE, we show that [(3)H]DAA1106 binds with high affinity to activated and infected macrophages in regions of synaptic damage. Further, binding affinity reflected by lower K(D) (dissociation constant) values and the B(max) (total number of binding sites) to K(D) ratios reflective of ligand-binding potential was significantly higher with [(3)H]DAA1106 compared to the extensively characterized PBR ligand [(3)H](R)-PK11195. These data suggest that DAA1106 binds with high affinity to activated and infected brain macrophages and possesses binding characteristics beneficial for in vivo use in the detection and clinical monitoring of HIVE using positron emission tomography.", 
    "49": "The presence of circulating antibodies from primary Sj\u00f6gren Syndrome (pSS) patients enable to interact with rat cerebral frontal cortex by activating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). ELISA assay for PGE2 generation, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was measured in cerebral frontal cortex slices by production of [U-14C]-citruline and mRNA isolation/quantitative PCR for COX-1 and COX-2 gene expression were carried out. By ELISA assay, it was shown that IgG from pSS patients reacted to cerebral frontal cortex cell surface and with human M1 and M3 mAChR. Beside pSS IgG displayed an agonistic-like activity stimulating NOS activity and PGE2 production associated with an increased COX-1 mRNA gene expression, without affecting COX-2 mRNA levels. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and NOS prevented pSS IgG effects upon both PGE2 production and COX-1 mRNA levels. The results support the notion that serum IgG auto antibodies in pSS patients target cerebral mAChR may have pathogenic role in immune neuroinflammation and on cognitive dysfunction present in pSS patients.", 
    "50": "Neurochemical studies document involvement of benzodiazepine (BDZ) and mu opioid receptors in seizure development and their possible age-related role during epileptogenesis. To study developmental changes of this role LiCl/pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE) was induced in P12, P25 and/or adult rats. This SE leads to epilepsy in all adult and subpopulation of immature rats. Using in vitro autoradiography, benzodiazepine (BDZ) and mu opioid receptor binding was evaluated 1 week (early phase of epileptogenesis) and 3 months (chronic phase) after SE in 27 brain structures involved in seizure generation and spread (amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei). The pattern of receptor binding changes was related to the age at SE, interval after SE and to brain structures. Enhanced BDZ binding was found 1 week after SE in many cortical areas in P12 and also in the amygdala complex and dentate gyrus in both P12 and P25. No changes of BDZ binding occurred in adults at that time, but 3 months after SE a decrease of binding appeared in all evaluated areas in both adult and P25 but not P12 rats. This decrease did not reflect neuronal loss. mu opioid receptors were less significantly affected but clear tendency to decrease binding occurred in adult rats in various cortical, amygdala and thalamic regions early after SE. Changes were less expressed in immature rats. Our data support the hypothesis that age-related changes of receptor properties may participate in different functional consequences of SE including epileptogenesis (more common in older age groups) and behavioral changes.",

All the reactions involved here are highly effective in giving the desired products under mild conditions.", 
    "52": "High levels of expression of the Na+-K+-2Cl- (NKCC1) cotransporter in immature neurons cause the accumulation of intracellular chloride and, therefore, a depolarized Cl- equilibrium potential (E(Cl)). This results in the outward flux of Cl- through GABA(A) channels, the opposite direction compared with mature neurons, in which GABA(A) receptor activation is inhibitory because Cl- flows into the cell. This outward flow of Cl- in neonatal neurons is excitatory and contributes to a greater seizure propensity and poor electroencephalographic response to GABAergic anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital and benzodiazepines. Blocking the NKCC1 transporter with bumetanide prevents outward Cl- flux and causes a more negative GABA equilibrium potential (E(GABA)) in immature neurons. We therefore tested whether bumetanide enhances the anticonvulsant action of phenobarbital in the neonatal brain", 
    "53": "Recurrent seizures were induced in the intact hippocampal preparation in vitro by continuous 5-hour exposure to low-Mg2+ solution. The anticonvulsant efficacy of phenobarbital, bumetanide, and the combination of these drugs was studied",

    "55": "Thus, alteration of Cl- transport by bumetanide enables the anticonvulsant action of phenobarbital in immature brain. This is a mechanistic demonstration of rational anticonvulsant polypharmacy. The combination of these agents may comprise an effective therapy for early-life seizures.",

Flunitrazepam was compounded and doses were administered in an 8-oz liquid solution. Primary data analyses examined subjective effects, response rates, distribution of choices between the risky and nonrisky option, and personality correlates related to peak drug effects. Individual-subject data were submitted to a computational modeling analysis (EVM) that provided parameter estimates corresponding to components of valence; updating expectancies about alternatives (learning/memory); and consistency between choices and expected outcomes (sensitivity to learned outcomes).",

    "60": "At sufficiently high doses, flunitrazepam can engender increases in risky decision making. Globally, these changes appear similar to previous effects we have observed after acute administration of alcohol and alprazolam.

    "61": "Infections with orthopoxviruses usually lead to cross-protection among all species of the family. This has been a prerequisite for successful eradication of smallpox. Here we report the rare case of a 17-year-old male, who survived a generalised cowpox virus infection of unusual severity but surprisingly did not show a proper seroconversion. Only a very weak antibody production was observed in early and late serum samples, which initially appeared to be cowpox virus specific in immunofluorescence. No neutralising antibodies were detected and in Western blotting antibody specificity was restricted to the orthopoxvirus H3L protein only. The patient had been hospitalised for alcohol and cannabis intoxication 2 months prior to the orthopoxvirus infection and high levels of cannabinoids have been found repeatedly in the urine and upon one occasion also benzodiazepines. As these substances are known to interfere with antibody production and no immunodeficiencies were detected, drug-induced immunosuppression can be suspected as the most likely cause. Therefore a possible link between \"soft\" drug use and sufficient immunosuppression to warrant alterations in vaccine policies using live virus vaccines like smallpox vaccine should be further studied.", 
    "62": "This study investigated whether the association between depression and diabetes was influenced by the presence of chronic somatic disease. To distinguish between depression and other psychosocial complaints, we studied the onset of diabetes in antidepressant (AD) users and benzodiazepine (BD) users, respectively. From the PHARMO database, which includes complete drug prescription data, we identified subjects using (i) no ADs and no BDs; (ii) AD but no BD; (iii) BD but no AD; and (iv) AD and BD. A total of 60 516 individuals (age: 45.5+/-17 years; 42.1% men) were followed from their first prescription for AD or BD until end of registration or a first prescription for antidiabetic drugs. The crude incidence rate in AD but no BD users was not increased compared with no AD and no BD users. After adjustment for age, sex and chronic diseases, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.05 (0.88-1.26) for AD but no BD users, 1.21 (1.02-1.43) for BD but no AD users and 1.37 (1.12-1.68) for AD and BD users compared with no AD and no BD users. We did not find an increased risk of diabetes in individuals using ADs. The association between BD use and diabetes was partly explained by chronic somatic comorbidity.",

An acquisition system for inputting digitalized absorption spectra into personal computers and a BASIC program for calculating derivative spectra were developed. Then, applications of the system to drug analyses that are difficult with traditional absorption methods are described. Following this, studies on the interactions of drugs with biological macromolecules by the DS and NMR methods were discussed. An (1)H NMR study elucidated that the small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) has a single membrane made of a phosphatidylcholine bilayer, and that chlorpromazine interacts with both the outer and inner layers. (13)C NMR revealed a reduction of the dissociation constants of phenothiazine drugs due to their interaction with SUV. The partition coefficients of phenothiazine, benzodiazepine and steroid drugs in an SUV-water system and the effects of cholesterol or amino lipids content on these partition coefficients were examined by the DS method. The binding constants of phenothiazine drugs to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the influence of Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), Br(-), and I(-) on these binding constants were determined by DS. It was found that I(-), Br(-), Cl(-) reduce the binding constants in this order, and that Na(+) and K(+) have no effect. A (19)F NMR study revealed that triflupromazine binds to BSA and human serum albumin in two regions including Site II with different populations, and that a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, niflumic acid, binds Sites Ia and Ib.", 
    "64": "We have previously reported the expression of CYP genes in human myeloblastic and lymphoid cell lines, and the induction of the CYP3A4 and GSTP1 genes by oxidative stress in the human erythroleukemia cell line, K562. To further elucidate the role of drug metabolizing enzymes in hematogenesis, we have characterized the expression of CYP genes in hemin-induced differentiated K562 cells. After incubation with 50 microM hemin for 3 d, the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 genes was induced by 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively. In contrast, the CYP1B1 and CYP2E1 genes were downregulated in these cells to below 10% of the control levels. Moreover, these changes correlated with the hemin dose and culture time. Metabolism of midazolam, a probe substrate for CYP3A4, in the differentiated K562 cells increased by 2-folds, suggesting that the induction of CYP3A4 activity is consistent with the mRNA level. If these changes in the CYP expression profile in hematopoietic cells occurred, the susceptibility to xenobiotics and/or the therapeutic drugs of the cells might be influenced, and it also affects the metabolism of endogenous substrates, such as steroids and prostaglandins.",

PSQI scores were significantly lower (indicating better sleep quality) in the 22 patients who discontinued BDZ (8.9 +/- 0.9) than in 39 with urine BDZ (11.2 +/- 0.7, P = 0.04). Sleep quality in patients who continued abusing BDZ improved more in the 'melatonin first' group than in the 'placebo first' group, with no differences in sleep quality improvement in patients who stopped BDZ. CONCLUSION Most improvement in sleep quality was attributed to BDZ discontinuation. Although melatonin did not enhance BDZ discontinuation, it improved sleep quality, especially in patients who did not stop BDZ.",

This rapid modification contributes to a reduction in GABA-mediated inhibition and the development of benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance. Previous hypotheses to explain the modification have included an alteration in the structural composition or posttranslational modification of the receptors. In a cultured hippocampal neuron model, we found that there was differential subcellular distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits and that the constitutive internalization of GABA(A) receptors containing a beta2/3 subunit was rapid and activity-dependent. Based on this finding, we posit that an activity-dependent increase in the rate of internalization of synaptic GABA(A) receptors during SE contributes to the reduction in inhibitory transmission and the development of benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance.",

The mechanism and brain region(s) that account for this action of flumazenil remain unknown. This investigation explored the potential role of several brain regions (amygdala, raphe, inferior colliculus, nucleus accumbens, and paraventricular hypothalamus) for these actions of flumazenil.", 
    "116": "Rats were surgically implanted with guide cannulae directed over the brain region of interest and then treated with an ethanol diet for three 7-day dietary cycles (5 days on ethanol diet followed by 2 days on control diet). At approximately 4 hours, flumazenil was administered intracranially into each of the first 2 withdrawals. Examinations of anxiety-like behavior followed 1 week later during a third withdrawal. In other animals, restraint stress sessions or intra-amygdala DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) injections, preceded by intraperitoneal flumazenil injections, were substituted for the first 2 ethanol treatment cycles to assess the potential anxiety-sensitizing action of stress or a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, respectively.", 
    "117": "Flumazenil treatment of the amygdala during the first 2 withdrawals blocked the development of sensitized anxiety seen during a third withdrawal. Similar actions of flumazenil were found when stress sessions substituted for the first 2 cycles of ethanol exposure and withdrawal. Amygdala treatment with DMCM magnified the anxiety response to the single subthreshold chronic ethanol treatment, and prophylactic flumazenil blocked this effect.", 
    "118": "Intra-amygdala flumazenil inhibits the development of anxiety sensitized by repeated ethanol withdrawal, stress/ethanol withdrawal, or DMCM/ethanol withdrawal. These actions suggest that site-specific and persistent effects of flumazenil on gamma-aminobutyric acid-modulatory processes in this brain region are relevant to sensitized behavioral effects seen in alcoholism.", 
    "119": "It has previously been reported that general learning ability (GLA) correlates positively with exploratory tendencies in individual outbred mice. This finding suggests the possibility that variations in stress reactivity modulate GLA and thus its relationship to exploratory tendencies. Here, the authors investigated the potential role of stress reactivity in regulating this relationship by assessing the effects of the anxiolytic chlorodiazepoxide (CDP; 10 mg/kg) on subjects' performance in a battery of diverse learning tasks as well as exploratory behaviors and stress reactivity. CDP-treated mice exhibited reductions in stress-induced corticosterone levels and behavioral reactivity to mild stressors and a corresponding increase in exploration. However, CDP-treated mice did not exhibit facilitated acquisition of any of the learning tasks and expressed GLA comparable to controls. Results indicate that although reduced stress reactivity promotes exploration, this does not translate into an up-regulation of GLA, suggesting that the relationship between GLA and exploration is not mediated by stress reactivity. The authors propose that variations in GLA reflect individuals' propensity for novelty seeking, whereas exploration reflects both stress reactivity and novelty seeking, the latter of which may underlie the relationship between exploration and GLA.",

Overdose with opioids and opiate products, was higher in male patients than in female patients. The most frequently involved drug groups were benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and analgesics. The most common cause of accidental poisoning was overdose by drug abusers. The Poisoning Severity Score was minor in 25.4%, moderate in 52.2%, and severe in 17.1% of patients.

    "124": "Mechanical ventilation is a stressful experience in neonates resulting in changes in neuroendocrine parameters, pain scores, and physiologic responses. Assisted ventilation in neonates is presumed to be associated with chronic repetitive pain, which in turn is associated with adverse long-term sequelae. Reasons to routinely sedate ventilated neonates include improved ventilator synchrony, improved pulmonary function, and decreased neuroendocrine responses, including cortisol, beta-endorphine, and catecholamines. Reasons not to treat include the well-known adverse side effects of pain medication, especially the opiates, including hypotension from morphine, chest wall rigidity from fentanyl, and tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal from both opiates and benzodiazepines. Additionally, adverse effects such as death and IVH are not improved with preemptive treatment. Chronic pain assessment is poorly validated and difficult to assess in this population, and most studies have evaluated only acute pain scores. If patients are treated, opiates are the most common class of drugs, with morphine the most well studied. Fentanyl may be advantageous in hypotensive, younger neonates because it has fewer cardiovascular effects. The benzodiazepines, midazolam and lorazepam, have been used in ventilated neonates, but midazolam has been associated with adverse effects in one small study so concern remains regarding its use. Significant gaps in our knowledge exist, especially in regard to long-term effects of treatment, or lack thereof, and in the assessment of the chronic pain associated with assisted ventilation.",

However, when administered at 1h during PISE, MPEP at 200mg/kg, combination of MPEP (200mg/kg) with MK801 (0.1mg/kg) or with MK801 (0.1mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5mg/kg), combination of SIB1893 (200mg/kg) with MK801 (0.1mg/kg) could effectively control behavioral SE, and were neuroprotective. In particular, the combination of MPEP with MK801 and diazepam could stop both behavioral SE and electrical SE (under EEG monitoring) within a few minutes after the administration. HPLC study showed that a high level of MPEP was maintained in the blood and its metabolism rate was slow in experimental mice with PISE. We therefore concluded that the combination of MPEP (200mg/kg) with MK801 (0.1mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5mg/kg) could effectively stop SE and its subsequent neuronal loss in the hippocampus when administered 1h during PISE. It may provide a new approach to effectively control intractable SE.",

An analysis was performed using the methods of mixed treatment comparison (MTC) to enable indirect comparisons to be made between the treatments. An economic model of treatments for the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder was developed.", 
    "138": "Forty-five trials were included in the clinical effectiveness review; all but one studied adults. This review found that for the prevention of all relapses, lithium, valproate, lamotrigine and olanzapine performed better than placebo, with lithium and lamotrigine having the strongest evidence. For depressive relapse prevention, valproate, lamotrigine and imipramine performed better than placebo, with evidence strongest for lamotrigine and weakest for imipramine. For manic relapses, lithium and olanzapine performed significantly better than placebo. The MTC found that the best treatment for bipolar I patients with mainly depressive symptoms was valproate, followed by lithium plus imipramine. For bipolar I patients with mainly manic symptoms, olanzapine was the best treatment. From the studies investigating psychosocial interventions, there were few data for each comparison and outcome. The evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), in combination with usual treatment, is effective for the prevention of relapse. Group psychoeducation and possibly family therapy may also have roles as adjunctive therapy for preventing relapse. The results from the decision analytic model developed on the cost-effectiveness of long-term maintenance treatments of bipolar I patients suggest that the choice of treatment is dependent upon a number of factors: the previous episode history of a patient and the mortality benefit assumed for lithium strategies. The results from the base-case analysis for patients with a recent history of depression suggest that valproate, lithium and the combination of lithium and imipramine are potentially cost-effective depending upon the amount that a decision-maker is willing to pay for additional health gain. Using conventional amounts that the NHS is prepared to pay for health gain, then the lithium-based strategies appear to be potentially cost-effective for this group. For patients with a recent history of mania, the choice of pharmacological intervention appears to be between olanzapine and lithium monotherapy. Again using conventional threshold as a reference point, the results suggest that lithium is the most cost-effective therapy. Excluding the additional mortality benefit associated with lithium-based strategies resulted in all treatments for patients with a recent history of a depressive episode being dominated by valproate and, in the case of patients with a recent history of a manic episode, by olanzapine.",

Olanzapine and lithium are efficacious for the prevention of manic relapses and valproate, lamotrigine and imipramine for the prevention of depressive relapse. There is some evidence that CBT, group psychoeducation and family therapy might be beneficial as adjuncts to pharmacological maintenance treatments. Insufficient information is available regarding the relative tolerability of the treatments or their relative effects on suicide rate and mortality. For patients with a recent depressive episode, valproate, lithium monotherapy and the combination of lithium and imipramine are potentially cost-effective. For patients with a recent manic episode, olanzapine and lithium monotherapy are potentially cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness estimates in both groups of patients were shown to be sensitive to the assumption of a reduced suicidal risk associated with lithium-based strategies. Further research is needed into the adverse effects of all treatments and the differential effects of agents. Good-quality trials of valproate, of combination therapy, e.g. lithium plus a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, of psychosocial interventions and of the disorder in children are also required.",

These drugs are often prescribed in order to find therapeutic uses in the fields of personality disorders, addictions, and dysfunctional behaviours that have not been accepted as indications (compassive use). This study enabled us to make a detailed description of the use of psychiatric drugs at the Madrid III prison, a centre with one of the lowest levels of pharmaceutical expenditure in the region. For a two-week period, all prescriptions of psychotropic drugs were collected and registered along with data of several possible conditioning factors. 20.5% of the population was receiving some kind of psychiatric drug; 76% of those inmates undergoing treatment were receiving one or two psychotropic drugs; 65% were taking sedatives, 38% antidepressants and 27% antipsychotic medication. The total amount of psychotropics consumed was 9,840 DDDs, 46% of which were sedatives, 17% of those being antidepressants and the other 14% antipsychotics. The total cost of the fortnight's treatment was 5,379 euros, 72% of which was spent on antipsychotic medication. There are signs that compassive use of the latest generation of antipsychotics and antiepileptics, and the newer antidepressants are a main cause of the dramatic increase in cost, and cost efficiency has not always been clearly demonstrated. One of the key influencing factors on amount, type and cost of treatment was the prescriptor. An unexpected result was that of finding no relationship between age, nationality, grade or other individual variables and prescription of different kind of medication, with the exception of benzodiazepines.",

She then abruptly stopped the medication and presented to the emergency room one week later with waxing and waning attention, confusion, disorientation and visual hallucinations. Oral lorazepam was dosed according to a protocol employing the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale (CIWA). Her symptoms of delirium resolved rapidly and she was discharged home on day three. A review of the literature did not show any other reports of carisoprodol withdrawal induced delirium. Such withdrawal symptoms could be expected as the mechanism of action of carisoprodol is similar to that of hypnotic sedatives.

MDI was established by postmortem blood screening. Of 24 cases, 13 were determined to be suicides, 9 were accidents, and 2 were indeterminate. The mean age was 37 years. Men were more likely to die from MDI by accident while women were more likely to die from suicide. The mean number of drugs found in suicides was 4, compared to 2 in accidents (p=0.0274). Opiates, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, ethanol, and cocaine were equally likely to be present in either group. Other legal drugs were more likely to be found in the suicides (p=0.0115). Ethanol was considerably less common in fatal MDI than controlled prescription drugs such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and also less common than other prescription drugs.

It has previously been proposed that gastrin acts as a cofactor during gastric carcinogenesis and hypergastrinemic transgenic INS-GAS mice are prone to developing gastric adenocarcinoma, particularly following H. pylori infection. We hypothesised that the increased risk of carcinogenesis in these animals may partly result from altered susceptibility of gastric epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis. Gastric corpus apoptosis was significantly increased 48 h after 12Gy gamma-radiation in mice rendered hypergastrinemic by transgenic (INS-GAS) or pharmacological (omeprazole treatment of FVB/N mice) methods and in both cases the effects were inhibited by the CCK-2 receptor antagonist YM022. However, no alteration in susceptibility to gamma-radiation-induced gastric epithelial apoptosis was observed in mice overexpressing progastrin or glycine-extended gastrin. Apoptosis was also significantly increased in gastric corpus biopsies obtained from H. pylori-infected humans with moderate degrees of hypergastrinemia. We conclude that hypergastrinemia specifically renders cells within the gastric corpus epithelium more susceptible to induction of apoptosis by radiation or H. pylori. Altered susceptibility to apoptosis may therefore be one factor predisposing to gastric carcinogenesis in INS-GAS mice and similar mechanisms may also be involved in humans.",

A properly trained anaesthetist, administering anaesthesia according to their knowledge of pharmacology and patient and surgical characteristics, assisted by clinical signs and monitoring, can minimize this risk. Relying upon volatile-based anaesthesia delivered at a concentration of at least 0.5 MAC may be effective, but this precludes the use of total intravenous anaesthesia techniques and in any case may lead to unwanted hypotension. Equipment failure may occur. Benzodiazepines do not protect the patient from awareness. The development of electroencephalographic monitors of anaesthetic depth provides an opportunity to prevent awareness. Two large scale studies, one of which was a randomized trial, have identified a 5-fold reduction in risk of awareness when depth of anaesthesia using bispectral index monitoring was used. The incidence of awareness can be further reduced with currently available techniques used more widely.",

While the use of incremental enteral sedation has increased, there is a paucity of published evidence to evaluate its safety. This study sought to assess the safety of individualized dosing of enteral sedation for adults in the dental outpatient setting. The authors sent a mail survey to members of the Dental Organization for Conscious Sedation (DOCS) concerning their practice and practitioner characteristics. Anonymous treatment forms with monitoring records were collected from respondents and analyzed for pre-specified adverse event criteria. The majority of respondents reported practicing incremental enteral sedation for two to five years, accounting for less than 10% of their practice. Incremental enteral sedation, either alone or in combination with nitrous oxide and oxygen, was used most frequently. Monitoring with both pulse oximetry and automated blood pressure (BP) were prevalent. Triazolam was the drug used most commonly for enteral sedation. Of the 7740 cases submitted, 1686 (21.8%) met event criteria; the most frequent event was a decrease of more than 25% in diastolic BP from pre-drug baseline. Neither provider training nor the percentage of practices engaged in incremental enteral sedation were associated with any event; however, practicing incremental enteral sedation for less than 12 months was a significant predictor of any event (p = 0.001). Risk of having an event was not related to practice factors (that is, the time spent practicing incremental enteral sedation, the percentage of the practice devoted to practicing incremental enteral sedation, the number of cases performed, or the type of monitoring) or training factors. This survey represents the largest number of subjects reported in the literature concerning enteral sedation. These observations provide evidence for the safety of enteral sedation when these drugs and combinations are administered by properly-trained dentists who monitor patients with pulse oximetry, BP measurement, and direct observation.",

Serum MDMA level 2 hours after ingestion was with 785 ng x mL(-1) above the dose considered lethal for adults (>500 ng x mL(-1)). After ingestion the patient showed life-threatening tachycardia of 210 beats min(-1), hyperthermia of 38.9 degrees C, seizures, and hypertension of 125/70 mmHg. Under supportive treatment (benzodiazepine, body cooling, rehydration therapy), 6 hours after admission, body temperature as well as the elevated blood pressure and heart beat had returned to normal values. Nine hours after ingestion the serum MDMA level was still 274 ng x mL(-1). The patient made a full clinical recovery and afterwards appeared to be a healthy boy. This case illustrates the need to consider the possibility of accidental Ecstasy ingestion in the differential diagnosis of a child suffering from convulsions with fever.", 
    "165": "This study was designed to determine if chronotropic responses induced by neurally released acetylcholine are modified by subtype-selective blockade of cardiac muscarinic cholinoreceptors. In anesthetized cats, a single burst of vagal stimulation was generated with an incremental time delay after the P wave of the atrial electrogram (P-Stimulus interval). The slope of the relationships between P-Stimulus and P-P intervals was used to assess changes in responsiveness of cardiac pacemaker to vagal effects throughout the cardiac cycle. An increase in P-Stimulus interval over the initial portion (approximately 120 ms) of the cardiac cycle produced a significant increment in lengthening of the P-P interval. Once the maximal negative chronotropic response was achieved, a further increase in P-Stimulus interval by only approximately 25 ms resulted in profound (by 80-90%) reductions in vagal effects, thus yielding a bimodal vagal phase response curve. Antagonists of M1 (pirenzepine), M2 (methoctramine and gallamine), and M3 (4-DAMP) muscarinic cholinoreceptors produced a reduction in the magnitude of maximal lengthening of cardiac cycle as well as an increase in latency of vagal effects. However, the increment in prolongation of P-P interval induced by a given change in timing of vagal stimulation during cardiac cycle was reduced by M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor blockers, but was unaffected by 4-DAMP. None of the antagonists modified the range of P-Stimulus intervals over which the maximum-to-minimum change of vagal responses occurred.

A large prospective, randomised, controlled study is warranted to investigate the efficacy and safety of ivLEV for the treatment of SE.", 
    "179": "Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a delayed adverse drug reaction associated with the use of aromatic anticonvulsant drugs. It has been most commonly reported with the use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital. Although its occurrence is rare, 1 in every 1000-10,000 exposures, AHS is a serious adverse event often resulting in hospitalization and even death. The clinical manifestations of AHS include a triad of symptoms consisting of dermatologic rashes, fever, and evidence of systemic organ involvement. Diagnosis is most frequently based on the recognition of this triad of symptoms and clinical judgment. The exact mechanism of AHS remains to be determined but is thought to have at least three components: deficiency or abnormality of the epoxide hydroxylase enzyme that detoxifies the metabolites of aromatic amine anticonvulsants, associated reactivation of herpes-type viruses, and ethnic predisposition with certain human leukocyte antigen subtypes. Arene oxides, the toxic intermediaries in the metabolism of anticonvulsant drugs, can accumulate and directly bind to macromolecules, causing cell death, as well as act as prohaptens that bind to T cells, initiating an immune response and systemic reactions. Management of AHS primarily includes discontinuation of the associated anticonvulsant drug. Systemic corticosteroids are usually required for full recovery. An important issue regarding AHS is the cross-sensitivity among aromatic anticonvulsant drugs, which has been reported to be 40-80%. This means that patients with a history of AHS should avoid further use of any aromatic anticonvulsant drug. In addition, a familial association with AHS exists, and family members of the patient with AHS should be educated that they may be at increased risk for developing AHS if they use aromatic anticonvulsant drugs. Anticonvulsant drugs that are generally considered safe are valproic acid and benzodiazepines. Other nonaromatic anticonvulsant drugs should also be acceptable. Pharmacists as health care providers can play an important role in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AHS.",

Although in vitro data are routinely used for the prediction of drug interactions, in vitro systems are not dynamic and sometimes fail to predict drug interactions. We sought to use the rat as an in vivo screening model to predict pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole. The pharmacokinetic studies were conducted following an oral dose of CYP3A substrates and an optimized oral regimen of ketoconazole. In vitro reaction phenotyping was conducted using individual human and rat cDNA-expressed CYP enzymes and human or rat liver microsomes in the presence of ketoconazole. The in vitro experiments indicated that the test compounds were largely metabolized by CYP3A in both human and rat. The compounds could be rank-ordered with respect to the increase in C(max) and area under the curve (AUC) values relative to midazolam in the presence of ketoconazole. The degree of pharmacokinetic interaction with ketoconazole was dependent, in part, upon their in vitro metabolism in the presence of rat CYP3A1/3A2 and in rat and human microsomes, co-incubated with ketoconazole, and on their fraction metabolized (f(m)) in the rat relative to other disposition pathways. Based on the rank-order of interaction, the compounds could be prioritized for further preclinical development.", 
    "192": "Lignin is a durable aromatic network polymer that is second only to cellulose in natural abundance. Lig-8, a lignophenol derivative from bamboo lignin, is a highly potent neuroprotectant. It protects human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis by preventing caspase-3 activation via either caspase-8 or caspase-9. It exerts this antiapoptotic effect by protecting mitochondrial membrane permeability from damage by H2O2 or the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand PK11195. Lig-8 has been also shown to scavenge the reactive oxygen or nitrogen species in vitro. Furthermore, lig-8 suppresses apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation, tunicamycin (endoplasmic reticulum [ER]-stress inducer), or proteasome inhibitor in pheochromocytoma cells. In addition, in vivo, lig-8 reduced intravitreal N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced retinal damage (decreases in retinal ganglion cells and inner plexiform layer thickness) in mice. Lig-8 prevents neuronal damage partly by inhibiting excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this article, we review the protective effects of lig-8 against apoptosis induced by various stimuli. Apoptosis is an active, energy-dependent process through which living cells initiate their own death. It can be induced by a variety of physiological and pharmacological stimuli. Apoptotic cell death is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, or Huntington disease as well as glaucoma. We believe that the elucidation of the mechanism of antiapoptotic action of lig-8 may help in finding new approaches to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "197": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major neurological complication in patients with severe liver disease. While the pathogenesis of HE is unclear, elevated blood and brain ammonia levels are believed to be major etiological factors, and astrocytes appear to be the primary target of its toxicity. A notable feature of ammonia neurotoxicity is an upregulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) (formerly referred to as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor or PBR), which is found on the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, the precise significance of this upregulation is unclear. To examine its potential role in ammonia-induced astrocyte dysfunction, we downregulated the TSPO using antisense oligonucleotides, and examined whether such downregulation could alter two prominent features of ammonia gliotoxicity, namely, the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and astrocyte swelling. Nontransfected cultures treated with NH4Cl (5 mM; 48 h) showed a significant increase in astrocyte cell volume (37.5%). In cultured astrocytes transfected with TSPO antisense oligonucleotides, such cell swelling was reduced to 17%, but this change was not significantly different from control cell volume. Similarly, nontransfected cultures treated with NH4Cl (5 mM; 24 h) exhibited a 40% decline in the cyclosporin A-sensitive mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) (P < 0.01) (a measure of the MPT). By contrast, cells transfected with TSPO antisense oligonucleotides did not display a significant loss of the DeltaPsi(m) following ammonia exposure. Our findings highlight the important role of the TSPO in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity.",

    "199": "Scalp infiltration with epinephrine-containing lidocaine solution can elicit significant hypotension before craniotomy under general anesthesia. A prospective randomized controlled study was designed to observe whether a lighter depth of general anesthesia could prevent the unintentional hypotension induced by the epinephrine scalp infiltration during neurosurgery or not. Fifty patients undergoing scheduled neurosurgery involving craniotomy were randomly allocated into 2 groups. After anesthesia induction, anesthesia was maintained with propofol 2 mug/mL and rimifentanil 2 ng/mL by target-controlled infusion in group 1, and propofol 4 microg/mL and rimifentanil 4 ng/mL in group 2 (control group), respectively. All the patients received epinephrine scalp infiltration with 1% lidocaine 16 mL containing epinephrine 5 microg/mL. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were recorded at 30-second interval from the baseline to 5 minutes after the beginning of local infiltration. Bispectral index readings indicated group 1 had the lighter general anesthesia than group 2 (P<0.05). MAP was higher (P<0.05) and heart rate was lower (P<0.05) at 1.5 minutes time point in group 1 than group 2. The mean percentage of maximal decrease in MAP was group 1 (13%) <group 2 (24%) (P<0.05). The mean percentage of maximal increase in MAP was group 1 (10%)> group 2 (4%) without significant difference (P>0.05). The results implied that keeping a lighter general anesthesia caused less decrease in arterial blood pressure and was a relative effective method to prevent hypotension episode induced by epinephrine scalp infiltration.",

Solubility of the drugs in such lipid carrier were determined by using differential scanning calorimetry and confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction study. The results showed that drug possessing relatively high solubility in the lipid carrier used could lead to a higher amount of drug recovered in the drug-lipid microparticles produced. However, too high amount of dissolved drug imposed an adverse effect on the solidification of the lipid carrier during ASES processing, which led to partial film formation in the production column and hence a lower yield of microparticles. Such adverse effect was not the case for the drugs with low solubility in the carrier but there was an incomplete recovery of drug in the produced microparticles due to the partial extraction by the supercritical gas instead. The maximum amount of drug recovered in the ASES-prepared microparticles was found to correlate to the solubility of drug in the lipid carrier so that it might be utilized as a predictive parameter for determining the amount of drug to be incorporated into the microparticles.",

    "210": "Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of functional capacities of most if not all organs, a reduction in homeostatic mechanisms, and a response to receptor stimulation. Also, loss of water content and an increase of fat content in the body are reported. Therefore, understanding the influence of age-dependent changes in composition and function of the body on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs is important before prescribing drugs to elderly patients. In this study, a Medline search for articles published in the period between 1975 and June 2006 was conducted with use of the key words aging, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics to review data related to alteration in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in elderly patients. Analysis of data revealed that the most important pharmacokinetic changes in old age include a decrease in the excretory capacity of the kidney more than the decline in the rate of hepatic drug metabolism. On the other hand, pharmacodynamic changes in the elderly are frequent and commonly ascribed to alteration in the sensitivity to drugs, irrespective of changes in drug disposition. For instance, the sensitivity of the cardiovascular system to beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists decreases in old age, and the incidence of orthostatic episodes in response to drugs that lower blood pressure increases. However, the central nervous system becomes vulnerable in the elderly to agents that affect brain function (eg, opioids, benzodiazepines, and psychotropic drugs). Therefore, these drugs must be used very cautiously in this age group. In conclusion, the complexity of the interactions between polypharmacy, comorbidity, altered pharmacodynamic sensitivity, and even modest changes in pharmacokinetics in elderly necessitate the medical approach \"start low and go slow\" for aged subjects, especially if drug therapy is considered beneficial or absolutely necessary for them.", 
    "211": "This study was conducted to identify how often parents of children with epilepsy encounter barriers to the use of diazepam rectal gel in day care or school settings and how these barriers affect the child and family. Sixty-four parents completed an 18-item questionnaire documenting their experience with asking their child's school to administer diazepam rectal gel. No data regarding its actual use in the school was obtained. Forty-three parents (68%) had asked their school to administer diazepam rectal gel; 35 (81%) reported school agreement, and 8 (19%) reported refusal. In 5 of these refusals, the cited reason was legal concerns, and in 5 cases the refusal had some adverse effect on their family's life. Most children prescribed diazepam rectal gel do not encounter resistance to its use in school and day care settings. Barriers to its use are usually due to legal concerns and significantly affect the family's quality of life."
