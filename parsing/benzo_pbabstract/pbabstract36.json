Occasionally, cases require analysis of drugs from tissues fixed in formalin solution. To improve the estimation of the level of drug in tissues following formalin fixation, we studied drug concentrations in human tissues, liver and kidney, that were collected from a drug-positive autopsy case. Parts of tissues were preserved in formalin solution for 1, 3, 6 and 13 months. Tissues obtained before and after preservation, along with tissue-exposed fixatives, were assayed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; all of the samples were assayed for the presence of drugs and changes in the drug concentrations both before and after preservation in formalin. Concentrations of assayed drugs decreased upon fixation in formalin; levels of these drugs did not necessarily show further decreases during subsequent storage in fixative, up to 13 months. Distinct trends in drug levels were found in liver and kidney. In liver, the levels of chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, and promethazine decreased to 23-39% at 1 month after preservation; all 3 of these drugs were detected at all tested time points of preservation. Bromazepam was not detected at 13 months after preservation. Milnacipran was the most unstable after preservation in formalin solution among all of the assayed drugs. In kidney, all assayed drugs exhibited reduced stability during preservation compared to levels in liver. Methamphetamine and methylenedioxymethamphetamine were not detected in any time points of tissues. The proportions of the drugs that remained within the tissues differed between liver and kidney. Also, S-oxide compounds of chlorpromazine and levomepromazine, which were not observed before preservation, were detected in fixed liver tissues and their fixatives at 3, 6 and 13 months of preservation. These results suggest that analyses in formalin-fixed tissues need to include analysis of various organ-tissues and their fixatives at multiple time points for the duration of preservation. These analyses should include detection of chemical degradation/denaturation products, such as S-oxides of chlorpromazine and levomepromazine.", 
    "1": "This review examines some of the issues encountered in the use of sedation in patients receiving respiratory support from non-invasive ventilation (NIV). This is an area of critical and intensive care medicine where there are limited (if any) robust data to guide the development of best practice and where local custom appears to exert a strong influence on patterns of care. We examine aspects of sedation for NIV where the current lack of structure may be contributing to missed opportunities to improve standards of care and examine the existing sedative armamentarium. No single sedative agent is currently available that fulfils the criteria for an ideal agent but we offer some observations on the relative merits of different agents as they relate to considerations such as effects on respiratory drive and timing, and airways patency. The significance of agitation and delirium and the affective aspect(s) of dyspnoea are also considered. We outline an agenda for placing the use of sedation in NIV on a more systematic footing, including clearly expressed criteria and conditions for terminating NIV and structural and organizational conditions for prospective multicentre trials.", 
    "2": "The goal of the study was an evaluation of the degree, in which nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the benzodiazepines (BZs)-induced recognition memory impairment in rats. The novel object recognition (NOR) test was used to examine recognition memory. The current research focused on the object memory impairing effects of diazepam (DZ; 0.5 and 1mg/kg, sc) and flunitrazepam (FNZ; 0.1 and 0.2mg/kg; sc) in 1-hour delay periods in rats. It was found that acute ip injection of L-arginine (L-arg; 250 and 500 mg/kg; ip), 5 min before DZ administration (0.5mg/kg, sc) prevented DZ-induced memory deficits. On the other hand, it was also proven that L-arg (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg; ip) did not change the behaviour of rats in the NOR test, following a combined administration with FNZ at a threshold dose (0.05 mg/kg; sc). It was also found that 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg; ip) induced amnesic effects in DZ in rats, submitted to the NOR test, following a combined administration of 7-NI with a threshold dose of DZ (0.25mg/kg; sc). However, following a combined administration of 7-NI (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg; ip) with FNZ (0.1mg/kg; sc), it was observed that 7-NI inhibited the amnesic effects of FNZ on rats in the NOR test. Those findings led us to hypothesize that NO synthesis suppression may induce amnesic effects of DZ, while preventing FNZ memory impairment in rats, submitted to NOR tasks.", 
    "3": "The objective of the present investigation was to optimize diazepam (Dzp)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NP) to achieve delivery in the brain through intranasal administration. Dzp nanoparticles (DNP) were formulated by nanoprecipitation and optimized using Box-Behnken design. The influence of various independent process variables (polymer, surfactant, aqueous to organic (w/o) phase ratio, and drug) on resulting properties of DNP (z-average and drug entrapment) was investigated. Developed DNP showed z-average 148-337 d.nm, polydispersity index 0.04-0.45, drug entrapment 69-92%, and zeta potential in the range of -15 to -29.24 mV. Optimized DNP were further analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ex-vivo drug release, and in-vitro cytotoxicity. Ex-vivo drug release study via sheep nasal mucosa from DNP showed a controlled release of 64.4% for 24 h. 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay performed on Vero cell line showed less toxicity for DNP as compared to Dzp suspension (DS). Gamma scintigraphy and biodistribution study of DNP and DS was performed on Sprague-Dawley rats using technetium-99m-labeled ((99m)Tc) Dzp formulations to investigate the nose-to-brain drug delivery pathway. Brain/blood uptake ratios, drug targeting efficiency, and direct nose-to-brain transport were found to be 1.23-1.45, 258, and 61% for (99m)Tc-DNP (i.n) compared to (99m)Tc-DS (i.n) (0.38-1.06, 125, and 1%). Scintigraphy images showed uptake of Dzp from nose-to-brain, and this observation was in agreement with the biodistribution results. These results suggest that the developed poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NP could serve as a potential carrier of Dzp for nose-to-brain delivery in outpatient management of status epilepticus.",

Involvement with drugs and temperament/character traits were assessed through the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and the Temperament and Character Inventory - Revised (TCI-R), respectively. Interactions among variables were analyzed using MANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment.", 
    "6": "Novelty seeking was the trait most associated with increased involvement with alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine. There was a significant association between harm avoidance and benzodiazepine use. Persistence was lower in cannabis-, benzodiazepine-, and cocaine-dependent subjects, as well as in hallucinogen abusers. Self-directedness was reduced in dependents of all drug classes. No strong relationships were found between other temperament or character dimensions and the severity of drug use.", 
    "7": "Novelty seeking was associated with increased involvement with all drugs studied in this sample, although to a lesser extent with benzodiazepines and hallucinogens. The temperament and character profile for benzodiazepine use was different from that of other drugs due to the relationship with higher harm avoidance and self-transcendence and lower self-directedness.",

    "9": "Health care outcomes were measured over a 1-year posttreatment period for episodes of antipsychotic therapy initiated between 1997 and 2002. Four episode categories were defined: restart after lapse in therapy, switch after break, switch without break, and augmentation. We estimated the impact of clozapine or olanzapine using mixed model regression for costs by type of service and days of uninterrupted drug therapy. Time to admission in an acute hospital, psychiatric hospital, or longterm care facility, and time to suicide attempt were compared using Cox proportional hazards models.", 
    "10": "Clozapine increased duration of therapy and decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalization or suicide attempts compared to olanzapine. However, increased drug costs and use of community mental health centers (CMHC) for complete blood count (CBC) monitoring overwhelmed any offsetting savings.", 
    "11": "Clozapine is more expensive than olanzapine over the first year of treatment, primarily due to frequent CMHC visits required for CBC monitoring. However, fewer psychiatric hospitalizations, reduced suicide attempts, and longer duration of treatment should generate more benefits over time, which could eventually outweigh clozapine's higher first-year costs.", 
    "12": "Brain networks can support learning by promoting acquisition of task-relevant information or by adhering to validated rules, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Upon learning, local inhibitory parvalbumin (PV)-expressing Basket cell networks can switch to opposite configurations that either favor or interfere with further learning, but how this opposite plasticity is induced and relates to distinct learning requirements has remained unclear. Here, we show that PV Basket cells consist of hitherto unrecognized subpopulations, with distinct schedules of neurogenesis, input connectivities, output target neurons, and roles in learning. Plasticity of hippocampal early-born PV neurons was recruited in rule consolidation, whereas plasticity of late-born PV neurons was recruited in new information acquisition. This involved regulation of early-born neuron plasticity specifically through excitation, and of late-born neuron plasticity specifically through inhibition. Therefore, opposite learning requirements are implemented by distinct local networks involving PV Basket cell subpopulations specifically regulated through inhibition or excitation.", 
    "13": "The optimal method of cooling hyperthermic patients is controversial. Although controlled data support ice water submersion, many authorities recommend a mist and fan technique. We report two patients with drug-induced hyperthermia, to demonstrate the rapid cooling rates of ice water submersion.", 
    "14": "Case 1. A 27-year-old man presented with a sympathomimetic toxic syndrome and a core temperature of 41.4\u00b0C after ingesting 4-fluoroamphetamine. He was submerged in ice water and his core temperature fell to 38\u00b0C within 18 minutes (a mean cooling rate of 0.18\u00b0C/min). His vital signs stabilized, his mental status improved and he left on hospital day 2. Case 2. A 32-year-old man with a sympathomimetic toxic syndrome after cocaine use was transported in a body bag and arrived with a core temperature of 44.4\u00b0C. He was intubated, sedated with IV benzodiazepines, and submerged in ice water. After 20 mins his temperature fell to 38.8\u00b0C (a cooling rate of 0.28\u00b0C/min). He was extubated the following day, and discharged on day 10.", 
    "15": "In these two cases, cooling rates exceeded those reported for mist and fan technique. Since the priority in hyperthermia is rapid cooling, clinical data need to be collected to reaffirm the optimal approach.", 
    "16": "Many patients with epilepsy experience 'clusters' or flurries of seizures, also termed acute repetitive seizures (ARS). Seizure clustering has a significant impact on health and quality of life. This review summarizes recent advances in the definition and neurophysiologic understanding of clustering, the epidemiology and risk factors for clustering and both inpatient and outpatient clinical implications. New treatments for seizure clustering/ARS are perhaps the area of greatest recent progress.", 
    "17": "Efforts have focused on creating a uniform definition of a seizure cluster. In neurophysiologic studies of refractory epilepsy, seizures within a cluster appear to be self-triggering. Clinical progress has been achieved towards a more precise prevalence of clustering, and consensus guidelines for epilepsy monitoring unit safety. The greatest recent advances are in the study of nonintravenous route of benzodiazepines as rescue medications for seizure clusters/ARS. Rectal benzodiazepines have been very effective but barriers to use exist. New data on buccal, intramuscular and intranasal preparations are anticipated to lead to a greater number of approved treatments. Progesterone may be effective for women who experience catamenial clusters.", 
    "18": "Seizure clustering is common, particularly in the setting of medically refractory epilepsy. Clustering worsens health and quality of life, and the field requires greater focus on clarifying of definition and clinical implications. Progress towards the development of nonintravenous routes of benzodiazepines has the potential to improve care in this area.",

This neurologic condition is associated with increased risk of nocturnal hypertension as well as cardiovascular events and affects patient's sleep, which leads to anxiety, depression, and decreases quality of life. Presence of RLS in patients on hemodialysis is associated with higher mortality rate. Most of the times, patients have indescribable symptoms. The aim of this review was to provide physicians with information to be aware and turn their attention to the patient's symptoms, which are the most important clue to diagnosis of RLS.", 
    "20": "For data extraction, we reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, the Cochrane collaboration, and Up to Date databases with the keywords of restless legs syndrome, sleep disorders, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The most recent review articles, clinical trials, and cross-sectional studies with large sample sizes that had used International RLS Study Group criteria (IRLSSG) and had focused on demographic characteristics and renal function were included. This situation has described in primary and secondary forms. The former usually occurs in younger patients and seems to have genetic tendencies and the latter is due to the iron deficiency state, pregnancy, and ESRD.", 
    "21": "Two major theories are developed regarding the pathophysiology of RLS. The first one concerns central nervous system dopamine imbalance and the second one concerns intracellular iron dysregulation. The most common used pharmacologic agents in treatment of RLS are dopamine agonists. Other used therapeutic agents include levodopa, Alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands, opioids, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, clonidine, iron therapy in low levels of serum ferritin, and nonpharmacologic therapies.",

    "23": "Benzodiazepines (BZ or BZD) are a class of gabaminergic psychoactive chemicals used in hypnotics, sedation, in the treatment of anxiety, and in other CNS disorders. These drugs include alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), clonazepam (Klonopin), and others. There are two distinct types of pharmacological binding sites for benzodiazepines in the brain (BZ1 and BZ2), these sites are on GABA-A receptors, and are classified as short, intermediate, or long-acting. From the thienobenzodiazepine class (TBZ), Olanzapine (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine) (Zyprexa) was used as an example to demonstrate the antagonism of this class of compounds for multiples receptors including: dopamine D1-D5, \u03b1-adrenoreceptor, histamine H1, muscarinic M1-M5 and 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3 and 5-HT6 receptors. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent, structurally related to clozapine, and extensively used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder-associated mania, and the behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The functional blockade of these multiple receptors contributes to the wide range of its pharmacologic and therapeutic activities, having relatively few side effects when compared to other antipsychotics agents. Thienobenzodiazepines (such as Olanzapine) are characterized as multi- receptor- targeted- acting- agents. This mini-review discusses these 2 drug classes that act on the central nervous system, the main active compounds used, and the various receptors with which they interact. In addition, we propose 12 olanzapine analogues, and generated Random Forest models, from a data set obtained from the ChEMBL database, to classify the structures as active or inactive against 5 dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 and D6), and dopamine transporter.", 
    "24": "Drug-impaired driving is a complex area of forensic toxicology due in part to limited data concerning the type of drugs involved and the concentrations detected. This study analyzed toxicological findings in drivers from fatal motor vehicle collisions (FMVCs) in Ontario, Canada, over a one-year period using a standardized protocol. Of the 229 cases included in the study, 56% were positive for alcohol and/or drugs. After alcohol, cannabis was the most frequently encountered substance (27%), followed by benzodiazepines (17%) and antidepressants (17%). There were differences in drugs detected by age but no marked difference in drugs detected between single and multiple FMVC's. Not all drugs detected were considered impairing either due to drug type, concentration or case history. The findings indicate the importance of comprehensive drug testing in FMVCs and highlight the need to consider a variety of factors, in addition to drug type and concentration, when assessing the role of drugs in driving impairment.", 
    "25": "In recent years, the aging population has been growing, and the operative techniques and anesthetic methods have advanced. With these developments and medical support, the number of operations on very elderly patients has been increasing. We report the perioperative management of off-pump CABG for a 93-year-old man. When the heart was displaced during the operation, hypotension was induced and a marked reduction of his bispectral index (BIS) to \"1\" appeared. During the perioperative period, the patient developed delirium that was difficult to manage, but he was discharged from the hospital without any complications on POD 21. As part of the perioperative management, intraoperative cerebral circulatory management with attention to cerebral perfusion and prevention of postoperative delirium is crucial.", 
    "26": "Various types of antipsychotics have been developed for the treatment of schizophrenia since the accidental discovery of the antipsychotic activity of chlorpromazine. Although all clinically effective antipsychotic agents have common properties to interact with the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) activation, their precise mechanisms of action remain elusive. Antipsychotics are well known to induce transcriptional changes of immediate early genes (IEGs), raising the possibility that gene expressions play an essential role to improve psychiatric symptoms. Here, we report that while different classes of antipsychotics have complex pharmacological profiles against D2R, they share common transcriptome fingerprint (TFP) profile of IEGs in the murine brain in vivo by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Our data showed that various types of antipsychotics with a profound interaction of D2R including haloperidol (antagonist), olanzapine (antagonist), and aripiprazole (partial agonist) all share common spatial TFPs closely homologous to those of D2R antagonist sulpiride, and elicited greater transcriptional responses in the striatum than in the nucleus accumbens. Meanwhile, D2R agonist quinpirole and propsychotic NMDA antagonists such as MK-801 and phencyclidine (PCP) exhibited the contrasting TFP profiles. Clozapine and propsychotic drug methamphetamine (MAP) displayed peculiar TFPs that reflect their unique pharmacological property. Our results suggest that transcriptional responses are conserved across various types of antipsychotics clinically effective in positive symptoms of schizophrenia and also show that temporal and spatial TFPs may reflect the pharmacological features of the drugs. Thus, we propose that a TFP approach is beneficial to evaluate novel drug candidates for antipsychotic development.", 
    "27": "Several studies have highlighted an increased risk of dementia in benzodiazepine users. As dementia incidence and benzodiazepine use are both high, particularly in the elderly, even a moderate increase in this risk would induce a tremendous number of cases and have a major public health impact.", 
    "28": "The aim of this article was to systematically review published observational studies having assessed the relation between benzodiazepine use and dementia, to assess and rank their quality and to provide a balanced opinion about the plausibility of a causal relationship.", 
    "29": "Out of the ten studies retrieved, nine reported an increased risk of dementia in benzodiazepine users. The risk increased with cumulative dose and treatment duration and when long-acting molecules were used. Even if the causal nature of this association remains unproved, the reviewed material provides arguments for evoking a causal link. Further research would be necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this effect, if any, to evaluate the risk of exposure in younger population and the influence of risk factors such as depression. In any case, the body of evidence seems sufficient for avoiding prescriptions or renewals that are not fully justified and indiscriminate long-term use.", 
    "30": "We present a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) triggered by clobazam in a 13-year-old girl who was subsequently treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.

    "31": "Positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors (GAMs) acting at specific subtypes of GABAA receptors effectively restore compromised spinal pain control in rodents. Studies addressing a similar antihyperalgesic effect in humans are sparse and are hampered by sedative effects of nonselective GAMs available for use in humans. We present results from a randomized controlled double-blind crossover study in 25 healthy volunteers, which addressed potential antihyperalgesic actions of clobazam (CBZ) and clonazepam (CLN) at mildly sedating equianticonvulsive doses. Clobazam was chosen because of its relatively low sedative properties and CLN because of its use in neuropathic pain. Tolterodine (TLT) was used as an active placebo. The primary outcome parameter was a change in the area of cutaneous UVB irradiation-induced secondary hyperalgesia (ASH), which was monitored for 8 hours after drug application. Sedative effects were assessed in parallel to antihyperalgesia. Compared with TLT, recovery from hyperalgesia was significantly faster in the CBZ and CLN groups (P = 0.009). At the time point of maximum effect, the rate of recovery from hyperalgesia was accelerated by CBZ and CLN, relative to placebo by 15.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-30.5), P = 0.040, and 28.6% (95% CI 4.5-52.6), P = 0.022, respectively. Active compounds induced stronger sedation than placebo, but these differences disappeared 8 hours after drug application. We demonstrate here that GAMs effectively reduce central sensitization in healthy volunteers. These results provide proof-of-principle evidence supporting efficacy of GAMs as antihyperalgesic agents in humans and should stimulate further research on compounds with improved subtype specificity.", 
    "32": "Goats are rarely anaesthetised; consequently, scant information is available on the efficacy of anaesthetic drugs in this species. Alfaxalone is a relatively new anaesthetic agent, of which the efficacy in goats has not yet been studied. In this study, the sedative and alfaxalone sparing effects of midazolam and butorphanol, administered alone or concomitantly, in goats were assessed. Eight clinically healthy goats, four does and four wethers, were enlisted in a randomised crossover manner to receive intramuscular sedative treatments consisting of saline 0.05 mL/kg, or midazolam 0.30 mg/kg, or butorphanol 0.10 mg/kg, or a combination of midazolam 0.30 mg/kg with butorphanol 0.10 mg/kg before intravenous induction of general anaesthesia with alfaxalone. Following induction, the goats were immediately intubated and the quality of anaesthesia and basic physiological cardiorespiratory and blood-gas parameters were assessed until the goats had recovered from anaesthesia. The degree of sedation, quality of induction and recovery were scored. When compared with saline (3.00 mg/kg), midazolam,administered alone or with butorphanol, caused a statistically significant increased level of sedation and a reduction in the amount of alfaxalone required for induction (2.00 mg/kg and 1.70 mg/kg, respectively). Butorphanol alone (2.30 mg/kg) did not cause significant changes in level of sedation or alfaxalone-induction dose. During induction and recovery, the goats were calm following all treatments, including the control group. Cardiorespiratory and blood-gas parameters were maintained within clinically acceptable limits. The present study showed that midazolam, administered alone or combined with butorphanol, produces a degree of sedation that significantly reduces the dose of alfaxalone required for induction of general anaesthesia in goats, without causing any major adverse cardiorespiratory effects.", 
    "33": "Evidence from human post mortem, in vivo and animal model studies implicates the neuroimmune system and activated microglia in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study aim was to further evaluate in vivo neuroinflammation in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using [(11)C]-PBR28 positron emission tomography. Ten patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (seven males, three females, 38-68\u00a0years) and ten age- and [(11)C]-PBR28 binding affinity-matched healthy volunteers (six males, four females, 33-65\u00a0years) completed a positron emission tomography scan. Standardized uptake values were calculated from 60 to 90\u00a0min post-injection and normalized to whole brain mean. Voxel-wise analysis showed increased binding in the motor cortices and corticospinal tracts in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis compared to healthy controls (p FWE\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Region of interest analysis revealed increased [(11)C]-PBR28 binding in the precentral gyrus in patients (normalized standardized uptake value\u00a0=\u00a01.15) compared to controls (1.03, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In patients those values were positively correlated with upper motor neuron burden scores (r\u00a0=\u00a00.69, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and negatively correlated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.66, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Increased in vivo glial activation in motor cortices, that correlates with phenotype, complements previous histopathological reports. Further studies will determine the role of [(11)C]-PBR28 as a marker of treatments that target neuroinflammation.", 
    "34": "The long term use of antiepileptic drugs possesses many unwanted effects; thus, new safe combinations are urgently mandated. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant effect of kava alone or in combination with a synthetic anticonvulsant drug, diazepam (DZ). To this end, female Wistar rats were divided into two subsets, each comprising 6 groups as follows: group (i) received 1% Tween 80 p.o. and served as control, while groups (ii) and (iii) received kava at two dose levels (100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.). The remaining three groups received (iv) DZ alone (10\u00a0mg/kg p.o.) or kava in combination with DZ (v) (5\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) or (vi) (10\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.). Results of the present study revealed that kava increased the maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) and enhanced the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam following both acute and chronic treatment. Moreover, neither kava nor its combination with DZ impaired motor co-ordination either acutely or chronically. Furthermore, kava ameliorated both the reduction in locomotor activity as well as changes in liver function tests induced by chronic administration of DZ. Moreover, no elevation was shown in the creatinine concentration vs. control group following chronic administration of kava or DZ either alone or in combination with kava. In conclusion, the present study suggests the possibility of combining a low dose DZ with kava to reduce harmful effects and might be recommended for clinical use in patients chronically treated with this synthetic anticonvulsant drug.",

Classes 1 and 2 were associated with poorer social and medical characteristics. Class 2 was also associated with greater prevalence of impulsive spectrum mental disorders. Class 3 was associated with greater prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders and cognitive dysfunction, and Class 4 was associated with higher prevalence of psychotic illness.",

    "45": "In rats, prenatal stress (PS) induces persistent changes in the brain that eventually can be translated in altered behavior leading to a greater consumption of psychostimulants in the offspring during adulthood. Though many studies have been carried on the effects of PS on stimulant drug responsiveness, little is known about susceptibility to benzodiazepines dependence in this animal model. We hereby examined the long-lasting impact of PS exposure during the last 10 days of pregnancy on the vulnerability to benzodiazepine addiction in adult rats. In addition, we also investigated the link between PS and the sensitivity to anxiolytics. Our results reveal that PS offspring exhibited a significantly greater preference to the diazepam-paired side than control offspring in the conditioned place preference. Importantly, we found that PS enhanced the anxiolytic effects of diazepam in the elevated plus maze paradigm. This work demonstrates that PS increased the abuse potential of benzodiazepines and the sensitivity to anxiolytic drugs in offspring of stressed mothers. Thus, investigating the interactions among addiction and PS may contribute to a better understanding how early life events modify neural circuitry and thereby behavior.",

The purpose of this study was to find out whether CAP affects rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) by using cocktail probe drugs in vivo. A cocktail solution at a dose of 5\u2009mL/kg, which contained phenacetin (15\u2009mg/kg), omeprazole (15\u2009mg/kg), and midazolam (10\u2009mg/kg), was given orally to rats treated for 7\u2009d with oral administration of CAP. Blood samples were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by HPLC-MS. The results showed that treatment with multiple doses of CAP had no significant effect on rat CYP1A2. However, CAP had a significant inhibitory effect on CYP2C19 and an inductive effect on CYP3A4. Therefore, caution is needed when CAP is co-administered with some CYP substrates clinically because of potential drug-CAP interactions.",

However, the National Health Insurance Drug Price list in Japan does not include any drug specifically used for the sedation. Although benzodiazepines are the main medication, their use in cases of gastrointestinal endoscopy has not been approved. This has led the Japan Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Society to develop the first set of guidelines for sedation in gastrointestinal endoscopy on the basis of evidence-based medicine in collaboration with the Japanese Society for Anesthesiologists. The present guidelines comprise 14 statements, five of which were judged to be valid on the highest evidence level and three on the second highest level. The guidelines are not intended to strongly recommend the use of sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy, but rather to indicate the policy as to the choice of appropriate procedures when such sedation is deemed necessary. In clinical practice, the final decision as to the use of sedation should be made by physicians considering patient willingness and physical condition.",

We aimed to assess whether long-term benzodiazepines use is risk for cancer.We conducted a longitudinal population-based case-control study by using 12 years from Taiwan National Health Insurance database and investigated the association between BZDs use and cancer risk of people aged over 20 years. During the study period, 42,500 cases diagnosed with cancer were identified and analyzed for BZDs use. For each case, six eligible controls matched for age, sex, and the index date (ie, free of any cancer in the date of case diagnosis) by using propensity score. For appropriate risk estimation, we observed the outcomes according to their length of exposure (LOE) and defined daily dose (DDD). To mimic bias, we adjusted with potential confounding factors such as medications and comorbid diseases which could influence for cancer risk during the study period. The data was analyzed by using Cox proportional hazard regression and conditional logistic regression.The finding unveils benzodiazepines use into safe and unsafe groups for their carcinogenicity. The use of diazepam (HR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.92-1.00), chlorodizepoxide (HR, 0.98; 95%CI, 0.92-1.04), medazepam (HR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.84-1.21), nitrazepam (HR, 1.06; 95%CI, 0.98-1.14), oxazepam (HR, 1.05; 95%CI, 0.94-1.17) found safer among BZDs. However, clonazepam (HR, 1.15; 95%CI, 1.09-1.22) were associated with a higher risk for cancers. Moreover, specific cancer risk among BZDs use was observed significantly increased 98% for brain, 25% for colorectal, and 10% for lung, as compared with non-BZDs use.Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, medazepam, nitrazepam, and oxazepam are safe among BZDs use for cancer risk. Our findings could help physicians to select safer BZDs and provide an evidence on the carcinogenic effect of benzodiazepines use by considering the LOE and DDD for further research.",

In the present study urine and/or blood samples of suspected drug users in criminal cases were analysed by GC-MS for 38 SDDs, and for the most frequent illicit and psychoactive licit drugs in Hungary. Between July 2012 and June 2013, 2744 suspected drug users were sampled in Budapest and during 2012 and 2013, 774 persons were sampled in South-East Hungary (Csongr\u00e1d County - neighbour the Romanian and Serbian borders). In Budapest 71.4% of cases, and in South-East Hungary 61% of cases were positive for at least one substance. Pentedrone was the most frequent SDD in both regions; however, the frequency distribution of the remaining drugs was highly diverse. SDDs were frequently present in combination with other drugs - generally with amphetamine or other stimulants, cannabis and/or benzodiazepines. The quarterly distribution of positive samples indicated remarkable seasonal changes in the frequency and pattern of consumption. Substances placed on the list of illicit drugs (mephedrone, 4-fluoro-amphetamine, MDPV, methylone, 4-MEC) showed a subsequent drop in frequency and were replaced by other SDDs (pentedrone, 3-MMC, methiopropamine, etc.). Newly identified compounds from seized materials were added to the list of new psychoactive substances (\"Schedule C\"). While the risk assessment of substances listed in Schedule C has to be performed within 2 years after scheduling, continuous monitoring of their presence and frequency among drug users is essential. In summary, our results suggest which substances should be dropped from the list of SDDs measured in biological samples; while the appearance of new substances from seized materials indicate the need for developing adequate standard analytical methods.",

From May to June 2014, we conducted an online parent-reported survey to collect information about the demographics, disease-specific clinical characteristics, as well as current and past use of antiepileptic medications by European patients with Dravet syndrome. We present data from 274 patients with Dravet syndrome from 15 European countries. Most patients were between 4 and 8years of age, and 90% had known mutations in SCN1A. Their epilepsy was characterized by multiple seizure types, although only 45% had more than 4 tonic-clonic seizures per month on average. The most common drug combination was valproate, clobazam, and stiripentol, with 42% of the total population currently taking stiripentol. Over a third of patients with Dravet syndrome had taken sodium channel blockers in the past, and most had motor and behavioral comorbidities. Our study helps define the current typical European patient with Dravet syndrome. The results from this survey may have important implications for the design of future clinical trials that investigate new treatments for Dravet syndrome.",

The IPI index has been validated for adults and children older than 1 year of age. In this study we aimed to study the value of IPI monitoring during pediatric endoscopic procedures. Our data consisted of 124 measurements of 109 patients undergoing different procedures (upper endoscopy 84 patients, colonoscopy 6 patients, both 9 patients). The data was divided into 3 groups based on the drug type used: propofol only, 5 patients (group 1); propofol & midazolam, 89 patients (group 2); propofol, midazolam and Fentanyl, 15 patients (group 3). Patients in group 2 and 3 had significantly higher IPI levels than group 1. Significantly lower IPI values were found between ages 4-6 compared to 7-12 years old. High midazolam dose was associated with lower IPI levels during the procedure. No significant differences were found for propofol doses. Patients who had an anesthetist present had lower IPI levels during the procedure compared to those who did not. No differences were noted between the different procedures. IPI alerted all apnea episodes (58 events, IPI = 1) and hypoxia (26 events, IPI \u2264 3) episodes, whereas pulse oximetry captured only the hypoxia episodes (IPI sensitivity = 1, specificity 0.98, positive predictive value 0.95). Younger patient age, use of propofol alone, higher midazolam doses and presence of anesthetist are all associated with lower IPI levels.",

Regression analysis showed that referral to psychiatry was associated with being male, native, psychiatric background, greater severity, lower global functioning, and behavioral disorders. Clinical observation (in a box) was associated with being female, greater severity, and psychotic or behavioral symptoms. Prescription of benzodiazepines was associated with anxiety, no history of addiction, and lower global functioning.

In addition, the compounds 5c and 6a,b have been evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity on some of the selected human cancer cell lines and these conjugates have exhibited significant cytotoxic activity. Further, the DNA-binding ability of these new conjugates has been evaluated by using thermal denaturation (\u0394Tm) studies.

By reviewing the most relevant studies (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLit, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library), a correct assessment to make the diagnosis (e.g., DSM-5, delirium assessment tools), the identification of the possible etiological factors, and the application of multicomponent and integrated interventions were reported as the correct steps to effectively manage delirium in palliative care. In terms of medications, both conventional (e.g., haloperidol) and atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole) were shown to be equally effective in the treatment of delirium. No recommendation was possible in palliative care regarding the use of other drugs (e.g., \u03b1-2 receptors agonists, psychostimulants, cholinesterase inhibitors, melatonergic drugs). Non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., behavioral and educational) were also shown to be important in the management of delirium.

Three patients presenting to the hospital with conditions limiting more typical routes of medication or fluid administration were treated with this new device; patients were administered water for hydration, lorazepam for treatment of alcohol withdrawal, ondansetron for nausea, acetaminophen for fever, aspirin for antiplatelet effect, and methimazole for hyperthyroidism. Placement of the device was straightforward, absorption of administered medications (judged by immediacy of effects, where observable) was rapid, and use of the device was well tolerated by patients, suggesting that this device may be an appealing alternative route to medication and fluid administration for a variety of indications in acute and critical care settings.",

Children who were <36 months of age, had congenital heart disease with PAH, and had been treated at our hospital between October 2011 and April 2013 (n = 187) were included in this retrospective study. Either dexmedetomidine/fentanyl (Group Dex) or midazolam/fentanyl (Group Mid) was used for postoperative sedation. The main outcome variables included delirium scores, supplemental sedative/analgesic drugs, ventilator use, and sedation time. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale (5.2 \u00b1 5.3 vs. 7.1 \u00b1 5.2 in the Dex and Mid groups, respectively; P = 0.016) and the incidence of delirium (18.2 vs. 32.0 % in the Dex and Mid groups, respectively; P = 0.039) were significantly lower in the Dex group than in the Mid group. Total sufentanil, midazolam, and propofol doses given during the operation did not differ between the two groups. Group Dex patients required significantly lower doses of adjunctive sedative/analgesic drugs than group Mid patients in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU; midazolam, P = 0.007; morphine, P < 0.001). In conclusion, we found no differences between dexmedetomidine/fentanyl and midazolam/fentanyl in terms of the duration of sedation, mechanical ventilator use, and CICU stay in children with PAH. However, patients in the Dex group required a lower additional sedative/analgesic drugs and had a lower incidence of delirium than patients in the Mid group.",

Modulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) chloride via GABAA receptor activation to achieve relaxation of precontracted ASM represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic option. Since human ASM GABAA receptors express only the \u03b14- and \u03b15-subunits, there is an opportunity to selectively target ASM GABAA receptors to improve drug efficacy and minimize side effects. Recently, a novel compound (R)-ethyl8-ethynyl-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methyl-4H-benzo[f]imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] diazepine-3-carboxylate (SH-053-2'F-R-CH3) with allosteric selectivity for \u03b15-subunit containing GABAA receptors has become available. We questioned whether this novel GABAA \u03b15-selective ligand relaxes ASM and affects intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) regulation. Immunohistochemical staining localized the GABAA \u03b15-subunit to human ASM. The selective GABAA \u03b15 ligand SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 relaxes precontracted intact ASM; increases GABA-activated chloride currents in human ASM cells in voltage-clamp electrophysiology studies; and attenuates bradykinin-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i, store-operated Ca(2+) entry, and methacholine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in peripheral murine lung slices. In conclusion, selective subunit targeting of endogenous \u03b15-subunit containing GABAA receptors on ASM may represent a novel therapeutic option to treat severe bronchospasm.", 
    "141": "As the sedative use increases due to the effectiveness and relatively safe profile, the abuse potential is also increasing. This study was conducted to examine the usage of four sedative agents in endoscopic examination and to compare the propofol use with the other three sedatives. Using National Health Insurance claims data from 2008 to 2012, we identified the number of cases of conscious sedation during endoscopy using one or more of the following agents: propofol, midazolam, diazepam, and lorazepam. The general characteristics of patients and medical service providers were analyzed, and the regional and annual distributions of frequency of use were compared. We also identified patient cases with excessive number of endoscopic examinations. Among the total of 3,156,231 sedatives users, midazolam was the most commonly used agent (n=2,845,250, 90.1%). However, the largest increase in patient number, which increased from 11,410 in 2008 to 28,170 in 2012, was observed with propofol. While the majority of patients received an annual endoscopy, we identified several suspected abuse cases of patients receiving endoscopies repetitively as many as 114 times in five years. The rise of sedative use in endoscopic examinations and several patient cases of repeated sedative administration suggest a potential risk for abuse. Medical service providers should be cautious when using sedatives and carefully review each patient's medical history prior to the procedure.", 
    "142": "The cytochrome P450-dependent mono-oxygenase system is responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemopreventive agents, chemical toxins and carcinogens, and >80% of therapeutic drugs. Cytochrome P450 (P450) activity is regulated transcriptionally and by the rate of electron transfer from P450 reductase. In vitro studies have demonstrated that cytochrome b5 (Cyb5) also modulates P450 function. We recently showed that hepatic deletion of Cyb5 in the mouse (HBN) markedly alters in vivo drug pharmacokinetics; a key outstanding question is whether Cyb5 modulates the activity of the major human P450s in drug disposition in vivo. To address this, we crossed mice humanized for CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 with mice carrying a hepatic Cyb5 deletion. In vitro triazolam 4-hydroxylation (probe reaction for CYP3A4) was reduced by >50% in hepatic microsomes from CYP3A4-HBN mice compared with controls. Similar reductions in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation and metoprolol \u03b1-hydroxylation were observed using CYP2D6-HBN microsomes, indicating a significant role for Cyb5 in the activity of both enzymes. This effect was confirmed by the concentration-dependent restoration of CYP3A4-mediated triazolam turnover and CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol and debrisoquine turnover on addition of Escherichia coli membranes containing recombinant Cyb5. In vivo, the peak plasma concentration and area under the concentration time curve from 0 to 8 hours (AUC0-8 h) of triazolam were increased 4- and 5.7-fold, respectively, in CYP3A4-HBN mice. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of bufuralol and debrisoquine were significantly altered in CYP2D6-HBN mice, the AUC0-8 h being increased \u223c1.5-fold and clearance decreased by 40-60%. These data demonstrate that Cyb5 can be a major determinant of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 activity in vivo, with a potential impact on the metabolism, efficacy, and side effects of numerous therapeutic drugs.", 
    "143": "The cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use are numerous and can be severe, with mechanisms of cardiotoxicity unique to cocaine that include sympathomimetic effects, blockade of sodium and potassium channels, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, and disruption of excitation-contraction coupling.

Cocaine-associated chest pain is particularly common and, in some instances, associated with a more severe cardiac syndrome, such as myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, or endocarditis. Therapy for cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction is similar to treatment in non-cocaine users, except for differences in the use of benzodiazepines and phentolamine and avoidance of beta-blockers in the acute setting. In this review, we discuss the most up-to-date literature regarding the mechanisms of cocaine-associated cardiotoxicity and clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment; we also discuss relevant controversies while proposing several important areas for future research.",

We hypothesized that frequent BZD and Z-drug use among these patients may be associated with psychiatric illnesses, particularly in long-term users. Methods. We included 1,081 patients with HIV between 1998 and 2011 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and matched them according to age, sex, and comorbidity with uninfected controls to investigate the psychiatric diagnoses and prescriptions of BZDs and Z-drugs. Cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) was assessed as the indicator of the duration of medication exposure. Patients exhibiting a cDDD exceeding 180 were defined as long-term users. Results. The patients with HIV had an increased risk of any use (odds ratio (OR):\u20098.70, 95% confidence interval (CI):\u20096.82-10.97) and long-term use (OR:\u20095.06, 95% CI:\u20093.63-7.04) of BZD and Z-drugs compared with those without HIV during the follow-up after demographic data and psychiatric comorbidities were adjusted. Conclusion. A large proportion of the HIV-infected patients received prescriptions of BZDs and Z-drugs. Mood disorders, insomnia, anxiety disorders, HIV infection, and substance use disorder were substantial predictors among the BZD and Z-drug users. These findings suggest that providing psychiatric services for HIV-infected patients is vital.",

Using population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling, evacetrapib and anacetrapib pharmacokinetics were characterized using available concentration-time data, and steady-state conditions were simulated. Published 2-compartment models for each compound were adapted to include a hypothetical third compartment representing a depot into which drug could partition. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling was used to predict steady-state conditions and terminal half-life based on known physicochemical and dispositional properties. The PopPK model described the anacetrapib data well, showing a likely third compartment with estimated apparent volume of 40,700\u2009L. Anacetrapib's estimated half-life for this compartment was 550 days. Simulations for evacetrapib using a hypothetical 3-compartment model, the third compartment being consistent with that of the anacetrapib model, produced predictions inconsistent with reported results, indicating that evacetrapib did not substantially accumulate into a large compartment. The PBPK simulations were consistent with PopPK results, predicting accumulation for anacetrapib (but not evacetrapib) followed by very slow elimination.

Fentanyl and its metabolites were quantified by LC/MS/MS in blood and urine samples obtained over 24\u2009hour. Exposure of fentanyl (AUC0- \u221e ) was significantly increased to 133% and systemic clearance was reduced to 78% by ketoconazole, norfentanyl formation was significantly delayed and partial metabolic clearance decreased to 18%. Fentanyl had no influence on midazolam exposure and CYP3A activity whereas ketoconazole decreased CYP3A activity to 13%. Although fentanyl N-dealkylation is substantially inhibited by ketoconazole, exposure of fentanyl itself increased by one third only. Clinically fentanyl dosage adjustments may become necessary when ketoconazole or other strong CYP3A inhibitors are given simultaneously. Fentanyl itself does not influence CYP3A activity.",

    "166": "2,961 subjects who used zolpidem for the first time longer than 3 months between 1998 and 2000 were identified in the National Health Insurance system of Taiwan. Subjects without a history of zolpidem use were randomly selected as a comparison cohort and frequency matched to zolpidem users based on age, sex, and index date. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was based on the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Its incidence until the end of 2009 was calculated and its hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis.", 
    "167": "The overall incidence of Parkinson's disease was greater among zolpidem users than in the comparison cohort (HR = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.45-2.45). However, there was no difference in Parkinson's disease incidence between these 2 cohorts after 5 years of observation. The risk of Parkinson's disease increased with increasing zolpidem dose, with an HR of 0.70 for low-dose users (< 400 mg/y) and 2.94 for high-dose users (\u2265 1,600 mg/y). The incidence of Parkinson's disease was greater in subjects using zolpidem only (HR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.66-3.33) compared to those using benzodiazepines only (HR = 1.31; 95% CI, 0.91-1.90). By stratified analysis, zolpidem use with concurrent depression (HR = 4.79) increased the risk of Parkinson's disease compared to that of zolpidem users without concurrent depression.", 
    "168": "Zolpidem use might unmask preclinical Parkinson's disease, especially in patients with depression. However, large population-based, unbiased, randomized trials are warranted to confirm this finding.", 
    "169": "A series of new dibenzodiazepinone-type muscarinic receptor ligands, including two homo-dimeric compounds, was prepared. Sixteen representative compounds were characterized in equilibrium binding studies with [(3)H]N-methylscopolamine ([(3)H]NMS) at the muscarinic receptor subtype M2, and seven selected compounds were additionally investigated at M1, M3, M4 and M5 with respect to receptor subtype selectivity. The side chain of the known M2 preferring muscarinic receptor antagonist DIBA was widely varied with respect to chain length and type of the basic group (amine, imidazole, guanidine and piperazine). Most of the structural changes were well tolerated with respect to muscarinic receptor binding, determined by displacement of [(3)H]NMS. Compounds investigated at all subtypes shared a similar selectivity profile, which can be summarized as M2>M1\u2248M4>M3\u2248M5 (46, 50, 57, 62-64) and M2>M1\u2248M4>M3>M5 (1, 58). The homo-dimeric dibenzodiazepinone derivatives UNSW-MK250 (63) and UNSW-MK262 (64) exhibited the highest M2 receptor affinities (pIC50=9.0 and 9.2, respectively). At the M2 receptor a steep curve slope of -2 was found for the dimeric ligand 63, which cannot be described according to the law of mass action, suggesting a more complex mechanism of binding. In addition to equilibrium binding studies, for selected ligands, we determined pEC50,diss, an estimate of affinity to the allosteric site of M2 receptors occupied with [(3)H]NMS. Compounds 58 and 62-64 were capable of retarding [(3)H]NMS dissociation by a factor >10 (Emax,diss >92%), with highest potency (pEC50,diss=5.56) residing in the dimeric compound 64. As the monomeric counterpart of 64 was 100 times less potent (62: pEC50,diss=3.59), these data suggest that chemical dimerization of dibenzodiazepinone-type M receptor ligands can enhance allosteric binding.",

Predictors were calculated in 6-month intervals and exactly 6 months before a drug overdose: opioid use (mean daily morphine-equivalent dose), benzodiazepine use (days' supply), antidepressant use (days' supply), zolpidem use (days' supply), mental health disorders (depression, anxiety/PTSD, psychosis), pain-related conditions, and substance use disorders (alcohol, other drug).", 
    "175": "A total of 1,385 (0.67%) subjects experienced a drug overdose (incidence rate 421/100,000 person-years).

Longer-term antidepressants (91-180 days) were protective for persons with depression, with 20% lower AORs for overdose versus short-term (1-30 days) or none. For persons without depression, the AORs of overdose were increased for antidepressant use, but greatest (AOR\u2009=\u20091.98) for short-term use versus none. The AORs of overdose increased with the duration of benzodiazepine therapy among all subjects, with over 2.5-fold higher AORs for 91-180 days versus none.", 
    "176": "Opioids and longer-duration benzodiazepines were associated with drug overdose among all subjects, but opioid risk was greatest for persons with depression.

    "177": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of once- versus twice-daily dosing of risperidone and olanzapine on clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia. Data from phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) schizophrenia study were used. Patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to treatment with risperidone and olanzapine, and were also randomly assigned to once-daily (N=173 and 169, respectively) or twice-daily (N=168 and 167, respectively) dosing and followed for up to 18 months. Discontinuation rate and time to discontinuation were used as primary outcome measures to compare the two groups. The following outcome measures were also analyzed: efficacy, safety, medication adherence, adverse events, and concomitant psychotropic medications. No significant differences in discontinuation rates and time to discontinuation were observed between the once- and twice-daily dosing groups (P>0.05) in patients receiving risperidone or olanzapine. The once-daily dosing group demonstrated significantly lower mean daily doses of risperidone and olanzapine across phase 1, and lower rates of hospitalization for exacerbation of schizophrenia, sleepiness, and orthostatic faintness in patients receiving olanzapine (P<0.05) compared to the twice-daily dosing group. No significant differences were found in any other outcome measures between the two dosing groups. In conclusion, effectiveness and efficacy outcomes between once- and twice-daily dosing for risperidone and olanzapine were not significantly different. However, in view of the lower mean dose and better side effect profile, it is advisable to adhere to a once-daily dosing regimen, especially in the case of olanzapine.",

The most commonly involved substances were drugs (253, 55.1%) followed by household products (137, 29.8%). The drug groups most involved were psychotropic drugs (62, 24.5%), which included benzodiazepines (54), anti-catarrhal (41, 16.2%), and antipyretics (39, 15.4%).",

The child was initially treated with 3 vials of antivenom specific for that scorpion species and showed a transient, though clinically relevant neurologic improvement. Her clinical course of sympathomimetic toxicity resumed and she was treated with intravenous fluids and benzodiazepines after blood analysis showed significant levels of d-methamphetamine. This case report is to specifically underline the clinical confusion in discerning between these two conditions and the realization of limited and/or expensive resources that may be used in the process.",

    "184": "Forty-five patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in the study, including 15 cases with normal liver function (Group N), 15 cases with moderate fatty liver according to both the results of ultrasonic diagnosis of moderate fatty liver and the laboratory results of elevated alanine transaminase less than 3 times the normal (Group M), and 15 cases with end-stage liver disease (Group S). Each patient received a single dose of 5 mg midazolam intravenously. CYP3A activity was measured by plasma 1'hydroxymidsazolam/midazolam (1'-OH-MDZ/MDZ) ratio at 2 h after administration of midazolam.", 
    "185": "They was no significant difference in CYP3A activity between the patients with normal liver function and moderate fatty liver (P=0.332). The activity of CYP3A in Group S was lower than in Group N and Group M (P=0.000). Multiple linear regression analysis showed a statistically significant linear relationship between the activity of CYP3A and alanine transaminase (ALT, R2=0.682, P=0.000), and total bilirubin (TB, R2=0.519, P=0.002). There were no other factors, including albumin (ALB, P=0.881) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP, P=0.497), correlated with the activity of CYP3A.", 
    "186": "We conclude that the activity of CYP3A in patients with end-stage liver disease decreased. The decrease in the activity of CYP3A was determined by the increase in the serum concentration of ALT and TB and not by patient's age or body weight. ALT and TB therefore might have predictive value for the activity of CYP3A. An abnormal liver function test likely gives the clinician a hint about dosage adjustment.", 
    "187": "Background. Poisoning with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) is still a major concern for emergency physicians and intensivists. Concomitant ingestion of other psychoactive drugs especially benzodiazepines with TCAs may make this clinical situation more complex. This study aimed to compare the arterial blood gas (ABG) values and the outcome of treatment in patients with coingestion of TCA and benzodiazepine (TCA + BZD) poisoning and TCA poisoning alone. Methods. In this cross-sectional study which was carried out in a tertiary care university hospital in Iran, clinical and paraclinical characteristics of one hundred forty TCA only or TCA + BZD poisoned patients (aged 18-40 years) were evaluated. ABG analysis was done on admission in both groups. Outcomes were considered as survival with or without complication (e.g., intubation) and the frequency of TCA poisoning complications. Results. Arterial pH was significantly lower in TCA + BZD poisoning group compared with TCA only poisoning group (7.34 \u00b1 0.08 and 7.38 \u00b1 0.08, resp.; P = 0.02). However, other complications such as seizure, and the need for the endotracheal intubation were not significantly different. All patients in both groups survived. Conclusions. Concomitant TCA plus BZD poisoning may make the poisoned patients prone to a lower arterial pH level on hospital admission which may potentially increases the risk of cardiovascular complications in TCA poisoning.", 
    "188": "Sedation during gastrointestinal endoscopy is often achieved using propofol or midazolam in general population. However, impaired protein synthesis, altered drug metabolism, and compromised hepatic blood flow in patients with liver cirrhosis might affect the pharmacokinetics of sedatives, placing cirrhotic patients undergoing endoscopy at a greater risk of adverse events. The objective of this study was to assess comparative efficacies and safety of propofol and midazolam in cirrhotic patients undergoing endoscopy.", 
    "189": "Randomized, controlled trials comparing propofol with midazolam in cirrhotic patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy were selected.

    "190": "Five studies between 2003 and 2012, including 433 patients, were included. Propofol provided a shorter time to sedation (weight mean difference: -2.76 min, 95% confidence interval: -3.00 to -2.51) and a shorter recovery time (weight mean difference -6.17 min, 95% confidence interval: -6.81 to -5.54) than midazolam did. No intergroup difference in the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or hypoxemia was observed. Midazolam was associated with the deterioration of psychometric scores for a longer period than propofol.", 
    "191": "This meta-analysis suggests that Propofol sedation for endoscopy provides more rapid sedation and recovery than midazolam does. The risk of sedation-related side effects for propofol does not differ significantly from that of midazolam. The efficacy of propofol in cirrhotic patients undergoing endoscopy is superior to those of midazolam.", 
    "192": "This report is a follow-up to a study on fatal poisoning in drug addicts conducted in 2012 by a Nordic working group. Here we analyse data from the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Data on sex, number of deaths, places of death, age, main intoxicants and other drugs detected in the blood were recorded. National data are presented and compared between the Nordic countries and with data from similar studies conducted in 1991, 1997, 2002 and 2007. The death rates (number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) increased in drug addicts in Finland, Iceland and Sweden but decreased in Norway compared to the rates in earlier studies. The death rate was stable in Denmark from 1991 to 2012. The death rate remained highest in Norway (5.79) followed by Denmark (5.19) and Iceland (5.16). The differences between the countries diminished compared to earlier studies, with death rates in Finland (4.61) and Sweden (4.17) approaching the levels in the other countries. Women accounted for 15-27% of the fatal poisonings. The median age of the deceased drug addicts was still highest in Denmark, and deaths of addicts >45 years old increased in all countries. Opioids remained the main cause of death, but medicinal opioids like methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl and tramadol mainly replaced heroin. Methadone was the main intoxicant in Denmark and Sweden, whereas heroin/morphine caused the most deaths in Norway. Finland differed from the other Nordic countries in that buprenorphine was the main intoxicant with only a few heroin/morphine and methadone deaths. Deaths from methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl increased immensely in Sweden compared to 2007. Poly-drug use was widespread in all countries. The median number of drugs per case varied from 4 to 5. Heroin/morphine, medicinal opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and alcohol were the main abused drugs. However, less widely used drugs, like gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), methylphenidate, fentanyl and pregabalin, appeared in all countries. New psychotropic substances emerged in all countries, with the largest selection, including MDPV, alpha-PVP and 5-IT, seen in Finland and Sweden.", 
    "193": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, can acutely induce fasting insulin resistance, but we do not know whether it is able to modulate the meal-induced insulin sensitization (MIS). Two main experimental groups (control and olanzapine-treated) were created with two subgroups (fasted and re-fed) within each. After oral vehicle/olanzapine administration, the first meal size and duration and the total amount of consumed food was recorded in conscious rats. Then, under anaesthesia, the carotid artery and jugular vein was prepared and cannulated to obtain samples for blood glucose and hormone determination as well as for insulin/glucose infusion, respectively. Basal insulin sensitivity and MIS was determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) calculation and by rapid insulin sensitivity test, respectively. In fasted animals, olanzapine increased blood glucose and plasma insulin and reduced basal insulin sensitivity, but it failed to modify other hormone levels. Postprandial leptin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels increased, and ghrelin level decreased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) both in vehicle- and olanzapine-treated groups, but plasma insulin increased only in vehicle-treated animals. Furthermore, decrement in ghrelin level was attenuated in olanzapine-treated animals compared to controls. There was no significant change in the first meal size and duration or in the total amount of food consumed. Olanzapine had no effect on the MIS. We demonstrated that olanzapine can induce insulin resistance without weight gain in healthy rats. Furthermore, the MIS was preserved after acute olanzapine treatment. The blunted postprandial ghrelin and insulin response could contribute to the effect of olanzapine on feeding behaviour. Pharmacological induction of MIS may improve the olanzapine-induced insulin resistance.", 
    "194": "Myoclonic status epilepticus or mixed absence-myoclonic status is uncommon in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), often precipitated by sleep deprivation, withdrawal of medication, or inadequate antiepileptic drugs (Thomas et al., 2006; Crespel et al., 2013). Such episodes respond well to benzodiazepines or valproate (Crespel et al., 2013). We present the video-EEG of a 24-year-old woman with JME and bipolar disorder. She had a confusional state five days after withdrawal of clonazepam (14 mg/d) and introduction of oxazepam (200 mg/d), followed by catatonic stupor with subtle myoclonus of the face and the arms. The EEG showed absence status (figures 1, 2), which stopped after IV injection of clonazepam (1 mg) (figure 3). Consciousness returned to normal [Published with video sequence and figures (1)]."
