Intravenous injections of ketamine or midazolam decreased the cerebral blood flow (CBF) by one third, as measured by intermittent 133Xe washout. By means of pharmacodynamic models, the effects on the CBF could be predicted from the arterial drug concentrations. The high-resolution CBF vs. time curves thus generated allowed the calculation of cerebral drug levels from arterio-venous concentration gradients in spite of a continuously changing regional blood flow. By their effects on the CBF, ketamine and midazolam decrease their own rate of transport to the brain, the immediate 30-35% drops in CBF giving similar reductions in initial net influx of drug. Physiological pharmacokinetic models assuming a constant regional blood flow are therefore not appropriate. Under clinical conditions, the CBF is determined mainly by the effects of the anesthetics and by the arterial CO2 tension. CBF changes in either direction influence the transport of drugs to the brain and may consequently result in impaired or exaggerated drug effects.", 
    "1": "Fasting and postprandial plasma CCK levels of 102 normal subjects were measured by bioassay with dispersed rat pancreatic acini. The reference values ranged from 0 to 4.2 pmol/L (CCK-8 equivalents) for fasting and from 1.1 to 13.5 pmol/L for postprandial state. There was no significant difference between male and female, or in different age groups. The effects of CCK receptor antagonists of 3 different categories on CCK bioactivity in plasma measured by the bioassay were investigated. L 364,718 (5 nmol/L), proglumide (1.0 mmol/L), or Bt2-cGMP (0.1 mmol/L) was either extracted by SEP-PAK C18 cartridges together with human plasma containing 8 pmol/L of CCK-8, or added into the plasma extracts before the assay. The CCK bioactivity was inhibited by all of the 3 CCK antagonists. The action of L364,718 could be eliminated by the procedure of plasma extraction, but not of proglumide or Bt2-cGMP. It was suggested that CCK bioassay can be used even if L364,718 was administered. However, CCK cannot be measured accurately if there are proglumide or Bt2-cGMP in the plasma.", 
    "2": "The ability of the heart to respond to adrenergic stimulation diminishes with aging, and this may be one of the factors contributing to the age-associated decline in cardiac stress responsiveness. On the other hand, little is known about the impact of aging on the responsiveness of the heart to cholinergic stimulation. In this study, we determined the chronotropic and inotropic responses of the isolated, Langendorff-perfused hearts from adult (6-8 months) and aged (28-30 months) rats to cholinergic agonists so as to assess age-related alterations in postsynaptic cholinergic control of heart function. The results showed the following. (i) In isolated perfused spontaneously bearing rat hearts, the negative chronotropic response to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-5) M) was up to 4-fold greater in the aged compared with adult hearts; this age-related difference was less marked (2-fold) but not abolished in the presence of a maximally effective concentration (5 microM) of the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine. (ii) The cholinesterase-resistant agonist carbachol (10(-9)-2.5 x 10(-6) M) elicited a 2- to 3-fold greater negative chronotropic response in the aged compared with adult hearts. (iii) In isolated perfused, electrically paced (4 Hz) rat hearts, carbachol (10(-9)-10(-5) M) elicited a concentration-dependent negative inotropic response, which was 2-fold greater in the aged compared with adult heart at all carbachol concentrations. (iv) Acetylcholinesterase activities (micromoles per gram per hour) were 50-60% lower in the aged atria (83 +/- 21) and ventricles (24 +/- 6) than in adult atria (210 +/- 20) and ventricles (47 +/- 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The chronic effects of carbamazepine administration (5, 10, 20 mg/kg i.p. daily for 14 days) on the anxiogenic response to pentylenetetrazole were studied in the light/dark aversion test. In mice, these effects were compared with those of sodium valproate (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg i.p.), a putative anxiolytic drug, and lorazepam (0.025, 0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg i.p.), a well-established anxiolytic drug. The results showed that the anxiogenic-like behavior induced by subconvulsant doses of pentylenetetrazole (15 mg/kg i.p.) was antagonized by the chronic administration of lorazepam as well as sodium valproate, a GABA agonist. In fact, the increased aversion of mice for the light compartment of the light/dark box was reduced. Carbamazepine failed to significantly alter the anxiogenic-like behavior of mice. These findings provide further evidence for the absence of anxiolytic properties of carbamazepine and for a behavioral anxiolytic profile of valproate similar to that of benzodiazepines.", 
    "4": "Supernatants of a human malignant cell line established from a CNS metastasis, contained several proteins with putative growth regulating functions. BioGel P-10 gel filtration chromatography, reverse phase HPLC purification, and amino-terminal sequencing of purified peptides resulted in characterization of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M, 10 kD), ubiquitin (6 kD), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2, 21 kD). In addition, CNBr cleavage and purification of resulting peptides revealed diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI, 8 kD) and melanoma inhibiting activity (MIA, 11 kD). The secretion of beta 2M as part of the HLA-class I complex may be related to impaired autologous anti-tumour immune function; ubiquitin may play a role in activation or deactivation of extracellular proteins or cell-cell interactions. As HTZ-19 cells respond in a dose-dependent manner to midozolam, DBI may interfere with growth regulation mediated by diazepam receptor sites. In a collagenolytic assay, TIMP-2 interfered with metalloproteinase functions, which are required for degradation of collagen type IV and organotopic metastasis. MIA is clearly associated with a proliferation inhibiting effect on HTZ-19 cells. In conclusion, although this tumour shows a degree of progression, several proteins with putative functions at different cellular levels were identified, related to proliferation as well as to the type of metastasis.", 
    "5": "Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) has been used as a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method to correlate the affinities of several antagonists towards CCK-A receptors with their steric and electrostatic fields. In this publication, we describe, for the first time, a field-fit operation as an alignment technique. These results could serve as a guide for the design of new non-peptide antagonists.", 
    "6": "Methadone maintenance therapy is designed to reduce the need for addicts to use heroin or other illegal opiates. Death in patients starting on such a program has not previously been documented. We report the death of 10 persons who died within days of starting a methadone maintenance program administered by general practitioners. Their bodies were subject to a full autopsy by forensic pathologists, with a full toxicological examination. The mean starting dose had been 53 mg, which had been increased to a mean of 57 mg by the final dose. Death occurred after a mean of 3 days. The mean blood methadone concentration at death was 2.1 mumol/L. Complete toxicological analysis showed that six subjects had additional drugs present including two with alcohol, two with benzodiazepines and morphine, and one with benzodiazepines alone. Pathological examination revealed the presence of chronic persistent hepatitis in all subjects and bronchopneumonia in five. The causes of death were given as methadone toxicity or methadone toxicity in combination with bronchopneumonia. Our observations highlight the dangers of methadone in the first days of starting on a maintenance program, particularly when the starting doses are relatively high and subjects have no demonstrated tolerance to opiates.", 
    "7": "Antipsychotic medications have altered the treatment of psychosis. The effect of typical agents is presumed to be associated with dopamine D2-receptor blockade. Response to these drugs can be evaluated by measuring target symptoms. Behavioural symptoms are generally first to respond, followed by affective symptoms, and then symptoms of disturbed cognition and perception. Predictors of response include age of onset, premorbid function, family history, cognitive function, ventricle size, and levels of homovanillic acid. As all conventional antipsychotic medications of comparable dose are generally of equivalent efficacy (with the exception of clozapine), choice is based on past response and the patient's tolerance of adverse effects. When antipsychotic agents are administered in the short term to control agitated dangerous behaviour, they can be given intramuscularly and augmented with benzodiazepines. For the ongoing treatment of psychosis, haloperidol 5 mg/day, or its equivalent, is usually sufficient. Continuation of treatment after an acute episode may be decided on the basis of chronicity of the psychotic illness. Relapse rates are higher when patients do not continue to receive medication. Lower maintenance doses may result in higher relapse rates but fewer adverse effects. Long-acting intramuscular depot preparations may be used to aid compliance in long term therapy. Adverse reactions correlate with potency. High potency drugs (i.e. those with greater D2 postsynaptic receptor affinity) are generally associated with extrapyramidal symptoms, including acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia and Parkinsonism. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is associated with all neuroleptic drugs. Low potency agents may cause orthostatic hypotension, sedation and anticholinergic effects. Clozapine has been shown to be effective in 30 to 40% of patients resistant to previous treatment. It does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms, but does have side effects similar to those of low potency agents and may cause agranulocytosis; it is therefore reserved for those patients who have not responded to therapy with 2 other agents. Several other atypical drugs are currently being investigated.", 
    "8": "Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRT) inhibitors (R82913; (+)-S-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-9-chloro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)- imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione; Cl-TIBO; and BI-RG-587, nevirapine) were used to select resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants by passage in cell cultures of wild-type or 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine; AZT)-resistant strains. Similar to other NNRT inhibitors, Cl-TIBO induced a single mutation (Y181 to C) in reverse transcriptase (RT) that accounted for the resistance. BI-RG-587 induced a different mutation (V106-->A) in AZT resistance backgrounds. A series of viable HIV-1 variants was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the RT, which harbored multiple drug resistance mutations, including Y181 to C. HIV-1 that was co-resistant to NNRT inhibitors and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine resulted when a 2',3'-dideoxyinosine resistance mutation (L74 to V) was also present in RT. By contrast, however, the Y181 to C mutation in an AZT resistance background significantly suppressed resistance to AZT, while it conferred resistance to NNRT inhibitors. However, the V106-->A substitution did not cause suppression of preexisting AZT resistance. Since certain combinations of nucleoside analogs and NNRT inhibitors might result in the development of co-resistance, careful analysis of clinical isolates obtained during combination therapy will be needed to determine the potential significance of these observations.", 
    "9": "The drug Ro5-3335 [7-chloro-5-(2-pyrryl)-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(H)-one] inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression at the transcriptional level through interference with Tat-mediated transactivation (M.-C. Hsu, A. D. Schutt, M. Holly, L. W. Slice, M. I. Sherman, D. D. Richman, M. J. Potash, and D. J. Volsky, Science 254:1799-1802, 1991). We confirmed this specific inhibitory effect in a quantitative bioassay based on transactivation of a chimeric gene comprising the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter fused to the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli and transfected in a HeLa cell line expressing Tat. Ro5-3335 was found to inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven lacZ gene expression at a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.5 microM. The in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of Ro5-3335 was highly dependent on the nature of the host cells. The highest selectivity index, 50, was found in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. The selectivity index was between 1 and 10 in the CD4+ T-cell lines CEM, MOLT-4 (clone 8), and HUT-78. In MT-4 and MT-2 cells, Ro5-3335 had no inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication. The absence of anti-HIV-1 activity of Ro5-3335 in MT-4 cells was confirmed by using different parameters of virus replication and different multiplicities of infection. In persistently HIV-1-infected HUT-78/IIIB/LAI cells, Ro5-3335 failed to demonstrate any activity at subtoxic concentrations. The cytotoxicity of Ro5-3335 was significantly lower in peripheral blood lymphocytes than in the CD4+ T-cell lines.", 
    "10": "Benz[e]indenes (BIs) are tricyclic molecules that can be envisioned as steroids without an A-ring. Because certain steroids are known to alter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in central neurons, we examined the effects of a substituted BI resembling 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP) on GABA-gated chloride currents in cultured postnatal rat hippocampal neurons. The compound, BI-1, reversibly potentiated GABA currents at concentrations of > 10 nM, with an EC50 value of 0.2 microM. BI-1 increased the apparent affinity of GABA for its receptor, decreasing the GABA EC50 from 9 microM to 3 microM. BI-1 had no effect on the shape of the GABA current-voltage relationship and did not alter the GABA reversal potential. The effects of BI-1 were not altered by benzodiazepine or picrotoxin site antagonists. At concentrations up to 10 microM, where maximal effects on GABA currents were seen, BI-1 did not directly activate a membrane current. This contrasts with the effects of 3 alpha-OH-DHP, which activated chloride currents at concentrations that were subsaturating for GABA potentiation. These results suggest that the BIs may be useful for determining the mechanisms by which steroids potentiate GABA responses and directly gate chloride channels.", 
    "11": "We investigated the way in which hexamethonium and pirenzepine, a selective muscarinic (M) 1 receptor antagonist, modify the release of catecholamines from dog adrenal gland in response to endogenous and exogenous acetylcholine (ACh) in vivo. Output of epinephrine (EPI), and norepinephrine (NE) was determined from adrenal venous blood by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Intraarterial (i.a.) injections of ACh (1.5 and 3 micrograms) or muscarine (3 and 6 micrograms) into the phrenicoabdominal artery and splanchnic nerve stimulation (SNS, 3 Hz) produced marked increases in EPI and NE output. Hexamethonium (1 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) inhibited the increases in EPI and NE output in response to exogenous ACh and SNS. Pirenzepine (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) inhibited the ACh-induced increases in EPI and NE output but did not modify the SNS-induced increases. The muscarine-induced increases in EPI and NE output were also inhibited by pirenzepine. These results indicate that the exogenous ACh-induced release of adrenal catecholamines is mediated through both nicotinic and M1 receptors, in contrast to the predominant mediation of nicotinic receptors in response to endogenous ACh.", 
    "12": "The frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and of micronuclei were determined in lymphocyte cultures of 25 patients who attempted suicide with diazepam, 6-12 h, 72 h and 30 days after self-poisoning. These data were compared with those of healthy controls. The frequencies of numerical aberrations showed a significant increase immediately after self-poisoning. However, this effect could not be detected on the 3rd and 30th days after self-poisoning.", 
    "13": "Many goitrogenic xenobiotics that increase the incidence of thyroid tumors in rodents exert a direct effect on the thyroid gland to disrupt one of several possible steps in the biosynthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones. This includes: (1) inhibition of the iodine trapping mechanism (thiocyanate or perchlorate); (2) blockage of organic binding of iodine and coupling of iodothyronines to form thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) (e.g. sulfonamides, thiourea, methimazole, and aminotriazole, amongst others); (3) inhibition of thyroid hormone secretion by an effect on proteolysis of active hormone from the colloid (lithium or an excess of iodide). Another large group of goitrogenic chemicals disrupts thyroid hormone economy by increasing the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones through an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. This group includes CNS-acting drugs (phenobarbital, benzodiazepines), calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, nifedipine), steroids (spironolactone), retinoids, chlorinated hydrocarbons (chlordane, DDT, TCDD), polyhalogenated biphenyls (PCB, PBB), and enzyme inducers. Thyroid hormone economy also can be disrupted by xenobiotics that inhibit the 5'-monodeiodinase which converts T4 in peripheral sites (e.g. liver and kidney) to biologically active T3. Inhibition of this enzyme by FD&C Red No. 3, amiodarone, and iopanoic acid lowers circulating T3 levels which results in a compensatory increased secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and an increased incidence of follicular cell tumors in 2-year or lifetime studies in rats. Physiologic perturbations alone, such as the feeding of an iodine-deficient diet, partial thyroidectomy, natural goitrogens in certain foods, and transplantation of TSH-secreting pituitary tumors in rodents also can disrupt thyroid hormone economy and, if sustained, increase the development of thyroid tumors in rats. A consistent finding with all of these goitrogens, be they either physiologic perturbations or xenobiotics, is the chronic hypersecretion of TSH which places the rodent thyroid gland at greater risk to develop tumors through a secondary mechanism of thyroid oncogenesis.", 
    "14": "In isolated dispersed pancreatic acini, we have characterized the interactions between cholecystokinin (CCK) and CCK receptors by simultaneously measuring CCK-33 immunoreactivity and CCK bioactivity. Incubation of acinar cells with CCK-33 at cell density of 0.2-0.3 mg acinar protein per ml resulted in stimulation of amylase release concomitant with significant and time-dependent decrease of the immunoreactive CCK. With L-364,718 (0.1 microM), a specific CCK receptor antagonist, immunoreactive CCK levels in the media were not significantly altered during incubation; however, CCK-stimulated amylase release was almost completely abolished (94% inhibition). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (1 nM) significantly potentiated CCK stimulated amylase release without affecting immunoreactive CCK in the media. Insulin (167 nM) did not affect the CCK stimulated amylase release or immunoreactive CCK in the media. Incubation of acinar cells with CCK-33 at 4 degrees C did not affect the levels of immunoreactive CCK; however, a significant change in levels of immunoreactive CCK were found at 37 degrees C at 90 min. Incubation of cell free medium with CCK-33 in the presence or absence of secreted enzymes revealed no changes in CCK immunoreactivity in the medium at 90 min. Addition of bacitracin in the incubation media did not affect the CCK immunoreactivity or bioactivity. These findings indicate that in isolated rat pancreatic acini, CCK-33 stimulates amylase release through a receptor that is specifically blocked by L-364,718. Specificity of the interactions of CCK-33 with acinar cells in the media appears to be receptor-mediated and time- and temperature-dependent.", 
    "15": "Ro 5-3335, a novel antagonist of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat activity, inhibits acute and chronic HIV-1 infection in T lymphocytes. Here we describe the effects of Ro 5-3335 on the accumulation of viral DNA during primary infection, the induction of virus from a latently infected cell line, and the expression of virus upon activation of naturally infected T cells. Ro 5-3335 permitted initial DNA synthesis during primary infection, but inhibited the subsequent increase in viral DNA copy number. The induction of HIV-1, as determined by the synthesis of p24 core antigen, was inhibited by 99% by Ro 5-3335 in both the model cell line and naturally infected T cells.", 
    "16": "Male Wistar rats were classified as susceptible (S) and resistant (R) to audiogenic seizures (AS) by evaluation of their response to high-intensity sound stimulation (110.3 dB). R rats injected with bicuculline into the inferior colliculus (IC) preferentially displayed audiogenic-like seizures with gyri, jumping and atonic falling, without important tonic-clonic components but with postictal contralateral asymmetry and hyperreactivity. These audiogenic-like seizures were blocked by clobazam microinjection into the substantia nigra (SN) and partially modified by SN vehicle injection. Injection of vehicle or clobazam into the SN of susceptible rats (S) did not modify the occurrence of AS. This may suggest the participation of GABAergic regulation in the development of audiogenic-like seizures in R rats and a defect in GABAergic neurotransmission in S rats.", 
    "17": "The synthesis of some derivatives and analogues of 12,13,14,14a-tetrahydro-9H,11H-pyrazino-[2,1-c]pyrrolo[1,2- a][1,4]benzodiazepine (isonoraptazepine) is reported. The new derivatives have been subjected to pharmacological tests for evaluation of antidepressant effects. Neurobehavioral assays were also carried out to acquire data on neurotoxicity and sedative action. Isonoraptazepine analogues and derivatives lacked the pharmacological activity of mianserin and aptazepine and showed properties similar to imipramine. Molecular modeling studies revealed structural similarities between isonoraptazepine derivatives and imipramine, thus explaining the similar pharmacological profile found in some of the tests employed. Based on pharmacological data the title compounds cannot be regarded as alpha 2 presynaptic adrenoceptors antagonists. In vitro studies for receptor binding gave support to this observation. The above studies lead us to conclude that isonoraptazepine derivatives are conformationally restricted analogues of imipramine, but their antidepressant activity cannot be correlated to inhibition of 5HT uptake. Among the derivatives tested, 7b and 8e show some affinity for the d-fenfluramine receptor site, a serotonin presynaptic site connected with anorectic activity.", 
    "18": "The mammalian GABAA receptor is a multisubunit protein containing a variety of binding sites for psychotropic agents. One of the most widely used of these drugs, ethanol, enhances the function of GABAA receptors in certain circumstances but not others. Previous studies have demonstrated that alternative splicing of the gamma 2L GABA subunit results in an ethanol sensitive and an ethanol-insensitive form, when combined with alpha and beta subunits. We have used in vitro mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes to show that the consensus site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C contained in the gamma 2L insert is critical for modulation by ethanol but not benzodiazepines, and manipulation of the phosphorylating enzymes in oocytes containing alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L can prevent ethanol enhancement. It is likely that phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a specific site on the GABAA receptor protein can act as a control mechanism for neuronal responses to alcohol exposure.", 
    "19": "This study was designed to determine the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the inhibition of gastric HCl secretion by duodenal peptone, fat and acid in dogs with chronic gastric and pancreatic fistulas. Intraduodenal instillation of 5% peptone stimulated both gastric HCl secretion and pancreatic protein secretion and caused significant increments in plasma gastrin and CCK levels. L-364,718, a selective antagonist of CCK-A receptors, caused further increase in gastric HCl and plasma gastrin responses to duodenal peptone but reduced the pancreatic protein outputs in these tests by about 75%. L-365,260, an antagonist of type B receptors, reduced gastric acid by about 25% but failed to influence pancreatic response to duodenal peptone. Addition of 10% oleate or acidification of peptone to pH 3.0 profoundly inhibited acid secretion while significantly increasing the pancreatic protein secretion and plasma CCK levels. Administration of L-364,718 reversed the fall in gastric HCl secretion and significantly attenuated pancreatic protein secretion in tests with both peptone plus oleate and peptone plus acid. Exogenous CCK infused i.v. in a dose (25 pmol/kg per h) that raised plasma CCK to the level similar to that achieved by peptone meal plus fat resulted in similar inhibition of gastric acid response to that attained with fat and this effect was completely abolished by the pretreatment with L-364,718. We conclude that CCK released by intestinal peptone meal, containing fat or acid, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on gastric acid secretion and gastrin release through the CCK-A receptors.", 
    "20": "The injection into the rat striatum of the polyamines spermine and spermidine (30-300 nmol) produced, 1 week after injection, a dose related loss of the neuronal markers glutamate decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase and a decrease in the density of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (as labelled with [3H]TCP). In parallel, an increase in peripheral type benzodiazepine (p) binding site density (a marker of the associated glial reaction and macrophage invasion) was observed. Intrastriatal injection of putrescine (300 nmol) did not significantly alter any of these markers. The effect of spermine on these neuronal and glial markers was maximal 3 days after injection, and tended towards control levels at 16 days post injection. The neurotoxic effects of spermine were confirmed by histological analysis demonstrating a massive neuronal loss around the injection site and an accumulation of astrocytes and phagocytes. The neurotoxic effects of spermine (250 nmol) were not antagonised by the previous administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Thus polyamine neurotoxicity in vivo does not seem to involve NMDA receptor activation, although it may possibly be related to the multiple effects of these compounds on diverse calcium channels and processes regulating calcium homoeostasis.", 
    "21": "We investigated whether pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PA-CAP27 and PACAP38) had any effect on gallbladder motility in conscious dogs, in which force transducers were chronically implanted in the gastric antrum, duodenum and gallbladder. PACAP27 and PACAP38 were administered intravenously during the digestive and interdigestive states at doses of 30, 100 and 300 pmol/kg. By way of comparison, cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) was administrated at doses of 3, 9 and 27 pmol/kg. As a result, each peptide evoked transient and tonic contractions both in the digestive and interdigestive states, and the effect on the motor index was dose dependent. PACAP27 and PACAP38 were 0.11 +/- 0.03 and 0.04 +/- 0.01 as potent as CCK-OP in the digestive state, and 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.02 +/- 0.01 in the interdigestive state, respectively, on a molar basis. Although PACAP27 and PACAP38 belong to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) family, intravenous administration of 300 pmol/kg of VIP had no effect on interdigestive gallbladder motility, but on the other hand inhibited gallbladder motility in the digestive state. The contractile effects of PACAP27 and PACAP38 were almost completely abolished by pretreatment with atropine or hexamethonium, but not with L364718. An in vitro study using canine gallbladder strips showed that PACAP27 and PACAP38 had no effect on spontaneous gallbladder motor activity evoked by electric field stimulation, CCK-OP or acetylcholine. It was concluded that PACAP27 and PACAP38 stimulate gallbladder motility in conscious dogs through a preganglionic cholinergic mechanism.", 
    "22": "Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) robustly stimulated the binding of 1 nM [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) to rat brain membranes with an EC50 of 146 microM in chloride-free buffer and 23 microM in buffer containing 200 mM NaCl. NaCl showed an EC50 of 40 mM for its ability to increase the potency of propofol. The ability of a range of anions to potentiate propofol's interactions with the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor was closely correlated with their permeabilities at this ion channel. Propofol, at a concentration of 300 microM, decreased the EC50 for the potentiation of FNZ binding by NaCl from 39 mM to 13 mM, with no change in the maximal potentiation. At a concentration of 30 microM, propofol significantly decreased the EC50 for potentiation of FNZ binding by the neurosteroid alphaxalone whilst increasing that for potentiation by pentobarbitone. We conclude that propofol is a potent barbiturate-like modulator of [3H]flunitrazepam binding.", 
    "23": "In vivo microdialysis was utilized to determine the effects of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands on cortical acetylcholine (ACh) release in awake young and aged rats. There were no significant differences in baseline cortical ACh release as a function of age. While administration of the BZR selective inverse agonist ZK 93 426 increased ACh release in both groups of animals, the aged rats exhibited a greater stimulation. Unexpectedly, under the present testing conditions, the BZR agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP) had no systematic effect on ACh release in either group. The presence or absence of these drug effects or drug-age interactions was not secondary to the impact of these compounds on behavioral activity. Cortical ACh release could also be stimulated by turning off the lights in the observation room or by the systemic administration of scopolamine. Aged rats were at least as able as their younger counterparts to respond to these manipulations with increased release. These results suggest that basal and stimulated release of cortical ACh is not impaired at the ages studied. Moreover, selective inverse BZR agonists may be a potent way of trans-synaptically stimulating cortical cholinergic transmission.", 
    "24": "We studied the effects of modification of duration of seizures induced by electroconvulsive stimuli (ECS) on the changes in concentration of neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurokinin A (NKA), substance P (SP) and neurotensin (NT)-like immunoreactivity (-LI) in specific rat brain regions. Rats were divided into groups pretreated with saline, indomethacin, flurbiprofen or diazepam prior to either six sham ECSs or six ECSs. After sacrifice by focused microwave irradiation, brains were dissected into frontal cortex, occipital cortex, striatum, hippocampus, pituitary and hypothalamic sections. Peptides were extracted and measured in extract aliquots by specific radioimmunoassays. Repeated ECS increased NPY-LI and NKA-LI in the hippocampus and the occipital cortex. No effect on SP-LI or NT-LI was found. Indomethacin and flurbiprofen had no effect on the tonic seizure time following ECS, and they did not affect the ECS-induced alterations of the brain peptides. Diazepam pretreatment decreased the tonic seizure time following ECS in a dose-dependent manner. However, diazepam did not modify the ECS-induced increase in NPY-LI and NKA-LI concentrations. The results firmly establish that ECS leads to specific peptide increases in discrete rat brain regions and raise the possibility that such changes may not entirely be a consequence of seizures per se.", 
    "25": "The gene encoding the rat mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) was cloned and characterized. Hybridization of a previously cloned cDNA for MBR to genomic Southern blots indicated that the gene was probably present at one copy per haploid genome. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends with rat adrenal RNA was used to obtain 47 nt of additional sequence upstream from our previously cloned MBR cDNA proving to be a crucial step in cloning the first exon of this gene. The MBR gene is comprised of four exons spanning approx. 10 kb. The first intron, contained within a 8-kb stretch of this gene, is located within the 5'-untranslated sequence, whereas the remaining two introns are much shorter (641 and 854 bp) and interrupt the coding sequence. The third intron contains sequences homologous to rodent B1 repetitive elements and a novel sequence closely resembling part of a repetitive element belonging to the Alu family in humans.

Kd was increased in suicides, and when brain sections from control subjects were incubated in the bath fluid that had previously served to incubate sections from suicides, Kd was increased in the same way. Results are discussed in terms of possible modulators of benzodiazepine binding sites, mainly tissue GABA and amino acid concentrations.", 
    "27": "Concurrent effects of benzodiazepines on stress-induced activation of the three classical \"stress\" systems: pituitary-adrenal, adrenomedullary, and sympathoneural systems have not been extensively investigated in humans. In the present study, the effects of alprazolam (1.5 mg) on plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), epinephrine, norepinephrine, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG, the intraneuronal metabolite of norepinephrine), and mood states were examined in 10 healthy volunteers undergoing glucoprivic stress. Glucoprivic stress was induced by intravenous administration of the glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), at a dose (50 mg/kg) that impairs cellular glucose metabolism and produces a state comparable to hypoglycemia. Alprazolam and 2DG were administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. 2DG produced robust elevations in plasma ACTH and epinephrine levels, modest elevations in plasma norepinephrine levels, and decreases in plasma DHPG levels. Alprazolam significantly attenuated the 2DG-induced increases in plasma ACTH and epinephrine, but did not significantly effect plasma norepinephrine and DHPG. These data suggest that benzodiazepines attenuate metabolic stress-induced activation of the pituitary-adrenal and adrenomedullary systems but do not effect 2DG-related effects on peripheral sympathoneural function. The possible mechanisms involved are discussed.", 
    "28": "Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) is a 9-kDa polypeptide that colocalizes in glial, adrenocortical, and Leydig cells with the mitochondrial DBI receptor (MDR). By binding with high affinity to the MDR, DBI and one of its processing products--DBI-(17-50)--regulate pregnenolone synthesis and have been suggested to participate in the immediate activation of adrenal steroidogenesis by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenals of hypophysectomized rats (1 day after surgery), ACTH failed to acutely affect the amount of adrenal DBI and the density of MDR but increased the rate of DBI processing, as determined by the HPLC profile of DBI-(17-50)-like immunoreactivity. The similar latency times for this effect and for ACTH stimulation of adrenal steroidogenesis suggest that the two processes are related. The ACTH-induced increase in both adrenal steroidogenesis and rate of DBI processing were completely inhibited by cycloheximide; this result suggests the requirement for the de novo synthesis of a protein with a short half-life, probably an endopeptidase. This enzyme, under the influence of ACTH, may activate formation of a DBI-processing product that stimulates steroidogenesis via the MDR. In support of this hypothesis is the demonstration that in hypophysectomized rats the MDR antagonist PK 11195 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide completely inhibited the adrenal steroidogenesis stimulated by ACTH and by the high-affinity MDR ligand 4'-chlorodiazepam.", 
    "29": "Data were analyzed from 905 opiate addicts who participated for the first time in a methadone maintenance program in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, between 1979 and 1989. Data of their physical and psychological state at the time of application for the methadone maintenance program were related to data of the addiction history and program progress. Only one fifth of the participants in the methadone maintenance program report to be in good health. Poorer health corresponds to reported psychological disorders. No correlation between demographical data and health status could be found, except that less qualified patients were in poorer health. Poorer health status is associated with the consumption of a higher amount of heroin per kg body weight and often with consumption of benzodiazepines before entrance into the methadone maintenance program. Methadone maintenance patients with a lower health status are given higher methadone doses. Compared to patients in better shape, more do not work before and during the methadone program. The physicians express less optimism with regard to the success of the program in patients in poorer health, and these are more often expelled from the program by their physicians or the health department. The results indicate that patients generally profit from the methadone maintenance treatment. However, better integrated patients and persons in better health may derive greater benefit from the methadone maintenance treatment.",

    "31": "We used receptor autoradiography to ascertain the distribution of GABAA and GABAB binding sites in the cerebellar cortex of the red-eared turtle (Pseudemys scripta). GABAA binding sites were found in both molecular and granule cell layers with highest levels in the granule cell layer. GABAB binding sites were found at highest level in the molecular layer. Benzodiazepine binding sites were found in approximately equal abundance in both layers. Little binding of any ligand was seen in the Purkinje cell layer. Our results are similar to those found in mammals and other non-mammalian vertebrates and indicate that the organization of inhibitory pathways of the cerebellar cortex has been conserved in the course of vertebrate evolution.", 
    "32": "In 61 acute schizophrenic patients the effects of haloperidol (HPL) and lorazepam combined vs. HPL alone and the interaction between these drugs were evaluated. Patients were assigned to groups randomly. The study design was open. Study duration was 28 days. Psychopathology was evaluated on the basis of BPRS scores. Extrapyramidal side-effects were rated according to Simpson and Angus (1970). Pharmacological parameters included serum levels of lorazepam, HPL, and reduced HPL. Mean daily lorazepam dosage was 0.05 mg/kg, mean HPL dosage 0.5 mg/kg. None of the patients treated with lorazepam and HPL achieved better BPRS total or subscores, nor did their condition improve faster than in patients treated with HPL alone. A significant linear relationship between lorazepam serum levels and oral dosage was found, but none between lorazepam serum levels and BPRS total score, subscore reduction, or extrapyramidal side-effects. The authors conclude that beneficial effects of lorazepam in the treatment of acute psychosis are scant and may not justify the risks incurred with routine comedication of lorazepam.", 
    "33": "Endozepines represent a novel family of regulatory peptides that have been isolated by their ability to displace benzodiazepines from their binding sites. All endozepines derive from an 86 amino acid precursor polypeptide called diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), which generates, through proteolytic cleavage, several biologically active endozepines. The aim of the present study was to compare the molecular forms of endozepines present in different regions of the rat brain and in various peripheral organs using an antiserum raised against the central (biologically active) region of DBI. Combination of HPLC analysis and RIA detection revealed the existence of two major forms (peaks I and II) of endozepine-immunoreactive peptides. The retention times of the two peaks (36 and 39 min, respectively) were identical in all tissues or organs tested. Western blotting analysis of cerebral cortex extracts confirmed the existence of two immunoreactive species with apparent molecular weights 4000 and 6000 Da, which respectively correspond to peaks I and II. Tryptic digestion of peaks I and II generated a single immunoreactive peptide that coeluted with the synthetic octadecaneuropeptide ODN [DBI(33-50)]. These results show that, in different parts of the brain and in various peripheral organs, DBI is rapidly processed to generate two peptides of apparent molecular weight of 4000 and 6000 Da, which both possess the biologically active determinant of endozepines.", 
    "34": "The effects of the gastrointestinal hormone and neurotransmitter cholecystokinin (CCK8) are complex, since it exhibits both an insulinotropic and a glucagonotropic effect. We investigated CCK8 in vivo with respect to glucose fluxes (production and elimination) at both low (6 mM) and high plasma glucose levels (9 mM) using the primed constant D-[3-3H]glucose infusion technique. In the presence of high glucose levels there was a dose-dependent increase in glucose elimination by CCK8. No effect of CCK8 on glucose production at a high glucose infusion rate (500 mg/kg per h) was observed in contrast to a low glucose infusion rate (100 mg/kg per h); plasma glucagon levels were elevated. All effects on glucose production and elimination were specific, since they were abolished by the CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. In summary, glucose elimination was slightly increased by CCK8 at low glucose levels but increased to a greater extent at high glucose levels; glucose production was increased by CCK8 only at low glucose levels. Thus, CCK is a regulator of glucose homeostasis.", 
    "35": "The pharmacodynamics and pharmacodynamic interactions of benzodiazepines have been determined using amplitudes in the 12-30 Hz frequency band of the EEG as a measure of the pharmacological response. Following the administration of a single intravenous dose, plasma concentration and pharmacological effect versus time profiles were determined and subjected to simultaneous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling to derive individual concentration EEG effect relationships. For flunitrazepam, midazolam, oxazepam and clobazam the concentration EEG effect relationships could be characterized on basis of the sigmoid Emax model. The values of the EC50 differed widely. A close correlation between the value of the EC50 and the affinity to the nanomolar benzodiazepine receptor in vitro was observed. For midazolam, bretazenil, flumazenil and Ro 19-4603 in addition to differences in potency also widely different values of the Emax were observed, which are in agreement with the known pharmacological properties of these compounds. The pharmacodynamic interaction between midazolam and flumazenil was characterized both under steady-state and non steady-state conditions. It was found that the effects of combined treatment with these drugs can be described and predicted on the basis of a competitive interaction model. The findings of these studies demonstrate that on the basis of an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic approach, important information on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacodynamic interactions of CNS active drugs can be obtained.",

The results of the study show that regarding influence on sleep quality and daytime well-being the non-benzodiazepine Z is significantly superior to placebo and slightly superior to the benzodiazepines F and T. 3. The advantage of Z treatment is the better daytime well-being after taking the hypnotic for sleep induction the night before. 4. This study shows that a quality standard equal to that in clinical practice may be achieved in private practice.", 
    "37": "The new potential anxiolytic ritanserin was studied in a double-blind manner vs. alprazolam, diazepam and placebo in 23 healthy subjects. The subjects belonged either to a high anxiety level group or a low anxiety level group, in order to study the effect of the anxiety level on the pharmacodynamic responses. The assessments included cognitive function (memory tests), psychomotor performance [Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF), Choice Reaction Time (CRT)], subjective ratings of alertness and overnight sleep and stress paradigm. Ritanserin (10 mg), alprazolam (0.75 mg), diazepam (10 mg) and placebo were given as single oral doses following a latin square design. Groups were well contrasted on the Cattell anxiety scale and were not overlapping. On no psychometric variable have there been any interactions between the anxiety level and the drug factor. At baseline an anxiety-related difference between the two groups was observed: lower CFF value in the high anxiety group (-1.4 Hz). Both benzodiazepines impaired psychomotor assessment and memory function and increased sleepiness. Ritanserin decreased CFF values without significantly affecting CRT on which nevertheless a trend to impairment was observed. Memory tests, and subjective ratings of alertness were unaffected by ritanserin. A trend to an antistress effect was observed on electrodermogram after ritanserin. Both benzodiazepines decreased central nervous system arousal and memory while ritanserin was inactive except on CFF. Recent data support the hypothesis that 5-HT2 blockers decrease pupil diameter which is a well known covariate of flicker frequency.", 
    "38": "Fifteen healthy male volunteers aged over 60 years received acute and repeated doses of paroxetine 20 mg or placebo, and acute doses of lorazepam 1 mg (as a positive internal control) with or without alcohol (0.6 g/kg of body weight) administered openly in a double blind balanced crossover study in which each subject acted as his own control. Psychomotor performance and cognitive function were assessed using a test battery which included critical flicker fusion, choice reaction time, compensatory tracking, Stroop and memory scanning tests. Subjective ratings of mood and sleep were recorded using line analogue rating scales. The pattern of results indicated that paroxetine had little or no effect on most of the test variables, and in some instances (critical flicker fusion thresholds) improved information processing ability. This was in marked contrast to the lorazepam verum which produced sedation and disruption of performance. Paroxetine had a slight antagonistic effect on alcohol induced sedation whereas impairment of performance with lorazepam was potentiated by co-administration of alcohol. The low behavioural toxicity of paroxetine in elderly volunteers has important implications for the pharmacotherapy of depression.", 
    "39": "1. Measurement of nociceptive thresholds at two skin sites in rats with chronic intrathecal catheters has allowed study of drug actions demonstrated to be at spinal level. 2. Using this preparation we have demonstrated segmental antinociceptive effects following intrathecal administration of agonists selective for benzodiazepine receptors, mu, kappa and delta opioid receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors and alpha adrenoceptors. 3. Such effects were dose related and were suppressed by appropriate selective antagonists. 4. Antagonist dose-response curves have been constructed for suppression of antinociceptive effects of various agonists. This has revealed complex interactions between spinal systems; for example midazolam produces its actions by activating an opioid system involving delta receptors.", 
    "40": "Binding equilibria for decanoate to a defatted, commercially available human serum albumin preparation were investigated by dialysis exchange rate determinations. The binding isotherm could not be fitted by the general binding equation. It was necessary to assume that the preparation was a mixture of two albumin components about 40% of the albumin having high affinity and about 60% having low affinity. By affinity chromatography we succeeded in purifying the low-affinity component from the mixture. The high-affinity component, however, could not be isolated. We further analyzed the fatty acid and drug binding abilities of the low-affinity component. The fatty acids decanoate, laurate, myristate and palmitate were bound with higher affinity to the mixture than to the low-affinity component. Diazepam was bound with nearly the same affinity to the low-affinity component as to the albumin mixture, whereas warfarin was not bound at all to the low-affinity component.",

    "42": "Pathology related to dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) develops later in cingulate cortex than in medial temporal areas. Therefore, end-stage cases have earlier forms of pathology in cingulate cortex, and postmortem studies of this region may provide a window on processes that temporal cortices pass through decades before death. Five classes of DAT have been described on the basis of neuron degeneration and receptor binding in posterior cingulate cortex. The present study assessed binding of 3H-oxotremorine-M with pirenzepine (OXO-M/PZ), a protocol for presynaptic muscarinic receptors, and thioflavin S-stained neuritic plaques (NPs) in cingulate area 23a in 12 DAT cases distributed over four classes of pathology and in nine age-matched control cases. OXO-M/PZ binding was significantly elevated in layers I, II, IV, and VI of all DAT cases and was very high in layer V compared to control cases. Almost 75% of the layer Va increase was due to binding in classes 2 and 3, while classes 1 and 4 were least affected. In class 3 cases, neuron density in layer Va was inversely correlated with OXO-M/PZ binding (r = -0.98) and primitive NP densities (r = -0.93). The close association between neuron densities and presynaptic muscarinic ligand binding in some classes confirms that there are independent classes of DAT. The high and inverse correlations between cortical pathology and ligand binding in class 3 cases suggest that there is a progression in class 3 pathology. Finally, elevated OXO-M/PZ binding and a report of increased choline uptake suggest that cholinergic axons sprout in DAT, and this sprouting may be associated with a progressive loss of postsynaptic elements.", 
    "43": "We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of the currently recommended low doses of midazolam for conscious sedation compared with diazepam for colonoscopy. Each agent was administered in a fixed ratio dose in combination with meperidine, and titrated incrementally to allow for adequate sedation prior to initiating and during the procedure. The currently recommended starting dose of midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) proved to be very appropriate for pre-medication. In contrast, the currently recommended starting dose of diazepam (0.10 mg/kg) proved excessive in 21% of patients (especially in those aged > 65). The low initial and incremental doses of midazolam compared favorably with diazepam in all efficacy parameters studied and exceeded diazepam in post-procedure amnesia scores (p = 0.01). Moreover, the sedative effects of midazolam at these lower doses were not lost despite long duration procedures (> 40 min). We conclude that midazolam, given in small incremental doses, in combination with meperidine, produces effective conscious sedation for colonoscopy and exceeds diazepam in its amnestic effect.",

The pharmacokinetic profile was affected by age, sex and anaesthetic technique. Advancing age was associated with a reduced clearance and a longer elimination half-time; clearance was greater and elimination half-time was shorter in males than in females. Clearance was also greater in patients anaesthetized with isoflurane than with the two other techniques. Age, sex and anaesthetic technique did not significantly affect the volume of distribution.", 
    "46": "This randomized, double-blind and double-dummy study was carried out in order to compare the perioperative sedation after premedication with either brotizolam 0.25-0.50 mg sublingually or diazepam 5-10 mg orally. Sixty-two patients aged 18-60 years scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery in general anaesthesia were included. Assessments were: 1. auditory continued response time (ACRT); 2. coma scale; 3. anxiety scale; and 4. final patient questionnaire. One hour after premedication the brotizolam group was more sedated, based on ACRT (P < 0.01) and the coma scale (P < 0.05). The final questionnaire showed (P < 0.05) that the brotizolam group was more satisfied with the effect of the premedication. Seven hours after the premedication the ACRT scores in both groups were similar to those before premedication and all the patients could walk about freely. In conclusion, as a premedicant in outpatients sublingual brotizolam appears to be a good alternative to diazepam.", 
    "47": "The effects of some analgesic-antipyretics on the spinal reflex potentials were studied in spinal cats. Aminopyrine at 25-100 mg/kg, i.v. produced a marked increase in mono- and poly-synaptic reflex potentials (MSR and PSR), and a decrease in dorsal root reflex potentials (DRR) in a dose-dependent manner. The amplitude of DRR decreased by aminopyrine was reversed by diazepam at 0.2 mg/kg, i.v.; however, the increased amplitudes of MSR and PSR were not affected by diazepam. Pretreatment of semicarbazide at 200 mg/kg, i.v. did not influence the increasing effect of aminopyrine on MSR and PSR. DL-5-Hydroxytryptophan produced facilitation of the MSR and PSR. In DL-5-hydroxytryptophan-treated cats, the amplitude of MSR was further increased by aminopyrine. Methysergide at 1 mg/kg, i.v. antagonized this increasing effect of aminopyrine on MSR and PSR. These observations suggest that the excitatory action of aminopyrine may be partly related to 5-hydroxytryptamine and not connected to the GABAergic mechanism. Other pyrazolone derivatives were also studied. Isopropylantipyrine at 50 mg/kg, i.v. produced increases in MSR and PSR. Intravenous sulpyrine at 500 mg/kg, antipyrine at 50 mg/kg or 4-aminoantipyrine at 50 mg/kg did not affect the reflex potentials. The non-pyrazolones, acetaminophen and indomethacin, did not increase the MSR and PSR. These results suggest that the N-dimethyl or isopropyl residue at the 4 position of the pyrazolone structure plays an important role in the excitatory action of analgesic-antipyretics in cat spinal cord.", 
    "48": "Kainic acid (KA 4-14 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) produces automatisms (scratching until third postnatal week, \"wet dog\" shakes thereafter), and clonic and tonic-clonic seizures in rats aged 7, 12, 18, 25, and 90 days. Administration of carbamazepine (CBZ) i.p. (25 or 50 mg/kg), phenobarbital (PB 20-80 mg/kg), clonazepam (CZP 0.2 or 1 mg/kg), or valproate (VPA 200 mg/kg) influenced neither incidence nor latency of automatisms. Clonic seizures that are regularly observed after the third postnatal week in controls were either abolished or substantially suppressed by any of the aforementioned antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Tonic-clonic seizures observed in the first 3 postnatal weeks were suppressed only by solvent [including propyleneglycol (PEG), ethanol, and water]; the effect of AEDs on tonic-clonic seizures was proconvulsant instead. The automatisms were most resistant to AED therapy. These results induce some doubts about the adequacy of the KA model for identifying AEDs effective against complex partial seizures, but forthcoming AEDs that suppress automatisms in the KA rat model might also be active against human complex partial seizures.", 
    "49": "Benzodiazepines for sedation may decrease the PaO2, the arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), and the CO2 response more in the elderly than in the young. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in blood gases due to i.v. midazolam or sublingual flunitrazepam given as premedication in elderly patients for unilateral cataract surgery. METHODS. Fifty patients over 65 years of age with treated arterial hypertension and other co-existing diseases (ASA III-IV) were randomly assigned to have: (1) i.v. midazolam titrated until they became drowsy (17 patients; 2.85 +/- 0.84 mg [mean +/- SD]); (2) sublingual flunitrazepam (16 patients; 0.005 mg/kg); or (3) no sedation (17 patients; controls). On entering the operating theatre, the radial artery was cannulated and the first blood gas analysis was obtained. The premedication was then given. At 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after premedication, before and 10 min after retrobulbar block, before operation, 5 and 15 min after the beginning of the operation, 10 and 20 min after administration of 500 mg acetazolamide i.v. during the operation, and 10 and 20 min after the operation additional arterial blood samples were analysed (a total of 15 measuring points). Pulse oximetry, invasive blood pressure, and ECG were continuously monitored. All patients received oxygen 3 l/min during the operation by nasal cannula. Differences between the three groups were analysed by Student's t-test or U-test and a P value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS. The patient demography, including duration of anaesthesia and operation, was similar in the three groups (Table 1). No significant differences were seen in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, PaO2, pulse-oximetric oxygen saturation (SpO2), base excess, or serum bicarbonate levels. The PaCO2 increased in patients after midazolam (P < 0.01) and flunitrazepam (P < 0.05) until the beginning of the operation compared with the control group (Fig. 3); 20 min after the operation there was still a significant difference between the midazolam group and the controls. SaO2 was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the midazolam group 10 and 20 min after administration of premedication compared with the control group, but was within physiological limits (Fig. 5). Despite titration, 2 patients had severe respiratory insufficiency 3 min after midazolam: the SpO2 decreased below 85% and the paO2 below 55 mmHg. The paCO2 was higher (P < 0.05) in the midazolam group 10 min after acetazolamide compared with the controls. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the study show the potential hazards of i.v. midazolam in the elderly. If sedation is required for cataract surgery under local anaesthesia, we recommend sublingual flunitrazepam or the use of benzodiazepines with lower hypnogenic effects in the elderly. A thorough preoperative discussion of anaesthesia and the operation might be an adequate substitute for any premedication in high-risk patients; the best blood gas analysis results were obtained in the control group.", 
    "50": "The effects of pentazocine, diazepam and midazolam in 100 patients to reduce the uncomfortable feeling during epidural block procedure were studied. All patients (ASA I-II) were premedicated with intramuscular atropine sulfate 0.5 mg and hydroxyzine 50 mg. To relieve pain and anxiety during epidural block procedure, pentazocine (15 mg; 20 Cases or 30 mg; 20 Cases), diazepam (5 mg; 20 Cases) or midazolam (2.5 mg; 20 Cases) was given intravenously in the operating room before epidural procedure. After the epidural block, patients were anesthetized with nitrous oxide-oxygen-isoflurane or nitrous oxide-oxygen-sevoflurane. The following day, patients' self-assessments of pain during epidural block procedure were categorized as good and fair. The effects of drugs were compared between patients with im premedication only with patients with further iv administration. Patients with pentazocine 15 mg were similar to the patients given only im premedication. Pentazocine 30 mg and diazepam 5 mg tended to allay the patients' pain feeling. Midazolam 2.5 mg was effective producing anterograde amnesia and antianxiety effects. Small doses of midazolam were effective to relief patients' uncomfortable feeling.",

Propofol produced more pain on injection (39% vs. 4% and 6% in the alfentanil and midazolam groups, respectively). Episodes of arterial oxygen saturation less than 90% were more frequent with alfentanil (28%) than with midazolam (3%) or propofol (13%). Using the visual analog scale, patients reported comparable levels of discomfort, anxiety, and sedation during the operation in all three treatment groups. Postoperative picture recall was significantly decreased with midazolam versus alfentanil and propofol. Finally, postoperative nausea was reported more frequently in the alfentanil group (29%) than in the midazolam (10%) or propofol (18%) groups, contributing to a significant prolongation of the discharge time in the alfentanil-treated patients.",

This study is a clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of flunitrazepam premedication, EMLA cream, and alfentanil continuous infusion for management of children undergoing such catheterization. Fourteen consecutive subjects aged 5-20 yr with Fontan shunts (right atrium to pulmonary artery) undergoing elective haemodynamic and electrophysiological catheterization were sedated with an individually titrated alfentanil infusion. After oral premedication with flunitrazepam 2 mg, the mean induction dose and mean maintenance requirement of alfentanil were 4.4 +/- 2.7 micrograms.kg-1 and 10.3 +/- 8.6 micrograms.kg-1 x hr-1, respectively. Mean oxygen consumption during haemodynamic catheterization was 4.1 +/- 0.4 ml.kg-1 x min-1 with an average individual variation of 10%. For every patient, tranquil and stable conditions during catheterization could be produced. It is concluded that alfentanil infusion is a method of sedation of children and adolescents with Fontan shunts during haemodynamic and electrophysiologic catheterization. However, continuous monitoring of ventilation and an understanding of the slow circulation time after Fontan operation are essential with such sedation in these patients.", 
    "60": "3S(-)-N-(2,3-Dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-yl) -1H-indole-2-carboxamide (devazepide), a potent and selective cholecystokininA (CCKA) antagonist, has been shown to reverse the inhibitory effect of exogenously administered CCK-8 on food intake. In all tests, however, the inhibition of food intake could have been due not only to the CCK-8 administered but also to synergistic interactions between administered CCK-8 and endogenous satiety signals, such as glucagon or CCK released from the small intestine, elicited by the postingestive effects of the test diet. To eliminate these possible interactions, we investigated the effect of devazepide on the inhibitory effect of CCK-8 on the intake of a milk diet during 30 min of sham feeding, a procedure that minimizes or eliminates the postingestive satiating effect of food. Under these conditions, devazepide was a potent antagonist of the inhibitory effect of CCK-8 (16 mumol/kg, IP): The approximate ED50 was 625 ng/kg (1.3 nmol/kg) and the threshold dose was between 62.5 and 625 ng/kg.", 
    "61": "A role has been proposed for cholecystokinin (CCK)-A-type receptors in mediating the anorectic action produced by serotonergic stimulation in rats. We examined the effect of pretreatment with the CCK-A antagonist devazepide (DVZ) on anorexia produced by peripheral administration of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] or CCK-8 in 3-h food-deprived rats consuming a 30-min test meal of sweetened mash. The anorectic effect of CCK-8 (4.0 nmol/kg, IP) was antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by DVZ (0.03, 0.10, and 0.30 mumol/kg, IP), with even the lowest dose producing a significant reversal. Under identical testing conditions, a supramaximal dose of DVZ (.75 mumol/kg) did not attenuate the reductions in food intake produced by either a moderate (4.0 mumol/kg) or a high dose (10.0 mumol/kg) of 5-HT. These data confirm established findings that the anorectic action of peripheral CCK depends upon CCK-A receptors. However, peripherally administered 5-HT reduces food intake independently of CCKergic function.", 
    "62": "Drinking was induced in food-deprived rats by a fixed-time 1-min schedule of food presentation. With three rats, d-amphetamine (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) led to a dose-related increase in licking early in the interfood intervals, the peak of the temporal distribution of licking being shifted to earlier values. These effects were seen even when d-amphetamine had no effect on overall rates of licking and drinking. With another three rats, however, diazepam (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg) did not shift the peak of the temporal distribution of licks in interfood intervals, even at doses that produced small increases in overall rates of licking and drinking. However, diazepam did reduce the peak of the distributions of licks at doses that did not decrease water intake and licks per minute.", 
    "63": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of triazolam (0.25 mg) on the arousal response to airway occlusion during nonrapid eye movement sleep in normal subjects. Six male subjects (mean age +/- SD, 28.1 +/- 7.1 yr) had their arousal response tested by occluding a mask covering the nose with the mouth sealed. After an adaptation night, subjects were studied on two consecutive nights. They ingested triazolam (0.25 mg) or placebo one-half hour before bedtime in a randomized double-blind crossover manner. Mask occlusion was performed 1 to 4 h after triazolam/placebo ingestion while the subjects breathed a mixture of air and oxygen adjusted to produce an arterial oxygen saturation of 98%. The maximal deflections in airway pressure were measured at a supraglottic location during airway occlusion to reflect the degree of inspiratory effort. The time to arousal (mean +/- SEM) was significantly longer on triazolam nights (32.0 +/- 5.2 versus 22.6 +/- 3.2 s, p < 0.01). The maximal airway suction pressure preceding arousal was higher on triazolam nights (26.5 +/- 2.0 cm H2O versus 20.0 +/- 1.2 cm H2O, p < 0.02). Conversely, the rate of increase in inspiratory effort (maximal pressure) during occlusion was not decreased by triazolam. We conclude that triazolam prolongs the time to arousal following airway occlusion by increasing the arousal threshold.", 
    "64": "The high incidence of postoperative emesis after strabismus surgery in pediatric outpatients can be reduced by the prophylactic administration of droperidol 75 micrograms/kg intravenously. However, this may be associated with profound sedation, delayed discharge, dysphoria, agitation, and extrapyramidal symptoms in this population. Because lorazepam used as an antiemetic in children during chemotherapy decreased the incidence of nausea and vomiting, we compared the antiemetic effects of lorazepam and droperidol in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 129 healthy children undergoing surgical correction of strabismus. The children, aged 1-13 yr, were randomly allocated into three groups. The children in group 1 received droperidol 75 micrograms/kg intravenously; those in group 2 received lorazepam 10 micrograms/kg intravenously; and those in group 3 received placebo. Anesthesia consisted of halothane, nitrous oxide in oxygen, and atracurium. Study drugs were administered intravenously after induction of anesthesia but before surgery. In children 3-13 yr old, administration of either lorazepam or droperidol was associated with a lower (P < 0.024) incidence of postoperative vomiting. There was no difference between the antiemetic effect of lorazepam and that of droperidol. The incidence of postoperative agitation was greater in the droperidol group (P < 0.001) than in the lorazepam and placebo groups. Postdischarge vomiting was less (P < 0.009) in children younger than 3 yr of age. Lorazepam, similar to droperidol, has an antiemetic effect in outpatient children 3-13 yr old undergoing strabismus correction, but it is associated with less postoperative agitation than is droperidol.", 
    "65": "The combined use of midazolam and spinal anesthesia is common in clinical practice. Despite the known potential for each to alter ventilation, the effect of their interaction has not been examined. Nineteen healthy volunteers were studied to assess the impact of intravenous midazolam (0.05 or 0.075 mg/kg), spinal anesthesia (T3-T8; mean level, T6), and their combination on resting ventilation and ventilatory responses to progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia. Resting ventilatory pattern was altered significantly by each condition. Midazolam caused a 29% decrease in resting tidal volume and a 24% decrease in mean inspiratory flow rate, while respiratory frequency increased by 14% and minute ventilation remained unchanged. By contrast, spinal anesthesia alone caused a 32% increase in tidal volume, a 24% increase in mean inspiratory flow rate, and a 13% increase in minute ventilation accompanied by a 14% decrease in respiratory frequency. The combination of midazolam and spinal anesthesia caused a significant decrease in minute ventilation (19%), tidal volume (28%), and mean inspiratory flow rate (27%), all of which were significantly more than the predicted sum of the individual interventions. Midazolam and spinal anesthesia each produced a significant decrease in hypercapnic ventilatory response slope, whereas their combination provoked no net change in hypercapnic ventilatory response slope. Interpretation of the hypercapnic ventilatory response data was complicated by shifts in the position of the ventilatory response curve, particularly under the spinal anesthesia condition. It is concluded that intravenous midazolam depresses resting ventilation, spinal anesthesia stimulates resting ventilation, and their combination has a modest synergistic effect of depressing resting ventilation.", 
    "66": "Repeated exposure to organophosphates has been shown to cause a decrease in muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. The present study measured the modulation of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes in rat brain areas during and following a 2-week daily exposure to the organophosphate disulfoton. The radioligands [3H]telenzepine and [3H]AFDX 384 were utilized to label M1 and M2 receptors, respectively. The study found comparable down-regulation in both [3H]telenzepine- and [3H]AFDX 384-labeled receptors in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum during exposure. Recovery of M2 subtype was slower than recovery of M1, especially in the hippocampus. The results suggest that M1 and M2 receptor subtypes may be similarly regulated in response to subchronic exposure to organophosphates, but that recovery of receptor subtypes to control levels may be governed by distinct factors.", 
    "67": "This study investigated the levels of oxygen saturation and pulse rates of patients undergoing minor oral surgery under local analgesia, with (20 patients) or without (20 patients) intravenous sedation with midazolam. The results indicated that a statistically significant fall in arterial blood oxygenation of 1% to 2%, as measured by pulse oximetry, followed midazolam administration; however, this was physiologically insignificant. Both groups showed a similar postoperative small fall in oxygen saturation. Transient episodes (24 to 36 seconds) of physiologically significant mild hypoxia occurred during breath holding, but this condition was readily corrected by encouraging patients to breathe deeply. Midazolam had a small but significant calming effect on the higher preoperative pulse rates exhibited by anxious patients, but this effect was not sustained during the operating period. Both sedated and unsedated patients showed episodes of tachycardia that could have significance for patients with cardiac disease.",

    "69": "The effect on in vitro migration of leucocytes and lymphocytes of various drugs used in anaesthesia have been determined in the concentration range 10(-2) to 10(-6) M. The drugs included, thiopentone, bupivacaine, lignocaine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, hydrocortisone, morphine (with and without preservative), lorazepam, suxamethonium, pancuronium and atropine. Toxicity and effect on random mobility after incubation for 1 and 18 h were also determined. Thiopentone depressed leucocyte function at a concentration of 10(-5) M which is comparable to clinical plasma concentrations. Increasing the duration of exposure of the cells to the drugs significantly lowered the concentrations at which depression of function was observed. At concentrations used during local infiltration in clinical practice, bupivacaine and lignocaine were toxic to both leucocytes and lymphocytes. Adrenaline, whilst having no direct effect on cell function, potentiated the effect of lignocaine. Morphine showed no effect at 10(-4) M, a level 1,000 times greater than the reported toxic plasma levels. However, this level falls within the range reported for drug addicts. No effects were found for the other drugs.", 
    "70": "To better define the physiologic relevance of the cholinergic muscarinic input to the rabbit colon and the role of different muscarinic receptor subtypes, we studied the effects of atropine, telenzepine (MI antagonist) and DF594 (M3 antagonist) on colonic motility in eight conscious rabbits fitted with bipolar electrodes and strain gauges along the proximal colon. In some experiments, the chronotropic and mydriatic effect of the pharmacological agents were also assessed. Two main patterns of spike activity were identified: short spike bursts (SSBs), which were usually stationary, and long spike bursts (LSBs), which were usually propagated. Both myoelectrical patterns were dose-dependently inhibited by atropine (0.06-4 mumol/kg). Atropine, at the doses of 2-4 mumol/kg, abolished both myoelectrical and mechanical activity. Telenzepine (0.008-0.125 mumol/kg) dose-dependently inhibited migrating LSBs without significant effect on SSBs. Higher doses (0.25-0.5 mumol/kg) inhibited both LSBs and SSBs. DF594 (0.06-2 mumol/kg) dose-dependently inhibited both migrating LSBs and SSBs. The three antimuscarinic agents, at doses that inhibited colonic spike activity by approximately 80% (equiactive doses), behaved as follows on heart rate and pupil diameter: atropine induced tachycardia and mydriasis, telenzepine had no effect, and DF594 induced slight mydriasis with no effect on heart rate. We conclude that spontaneous motility in the rabbit proximal colon depends on a muscarinic excitatory input. M3 receptors are involved in the control of both LSBs and SSBs, while M1 receptors play an important role in the regulation of LSBs. The development of selective antimuscarinic drugs, acting on a given motility pattern and with minimal side effects, may offer new perspectives in the treatment of functional bowel motor disorders.",

The radiolabeled bolus was deposited on the dorsal mucosal surface at the distal end of the right and left main bronchus via flexible bronchoscopy. The movement of the microspheres toward the trachea was visualized and recorded using a scintillation camera; quantitative evaluation utilized the condensed image.", 
    "76": "The technique was validated in a bronchoscopy model and in an intubated patient by moving a radioactive drop in a catheter through the main bronchi at velocities from 0 to 20 mm/min. The velocities determined by the image processing technique correlated well with the data by the model and patient determination (right bronchus, r = 1.0; left bronchus, r = 1.0). In seven ventilated patients, mechanical irritation by the fiberscope produced no significant effect on BTV. The BTV was measured preoperatively in seven conscious patients one day before surgery while they received local anesthesia with 10 ml of 1 percent lidocaine and postoperatively while they received intubation anesthesia. The preoperative and postoperative BTV values showed no significant differences (10.5; 5.7 to 13.7 mm/min; vs 9.7 (3.7 to 15.3) (median with range).",

    "78": "Volunteer male subjects received single 1.0 mg oral doses of alprazolam and of clonazepam on two occasions, during coadministration of 40 mg/day fluoxetine or of placebo. When the sequence of trials was placebo first and fluoxetine second, fluoxetine coadministration significantly prolonged alprazolam half-life (20 versus 17 hours) and reduced clearance (48 versus 61 ml/min). No effect of fluoxetine was seen when fluoxetine was given first and placebo second, because norfluoxetine persisted into the placebo phase even though fluoxetine had been discontinued 2 weeks earlier. Fluoxetine had no significant effects on clonazepam elimination half-life or clearance regardless of the sequence of fluoxetine and placebo administration. In the fluoxetine-placebo sequence, fluoxetine significantly increased the rate of clonazepam absorption. Thus fluoxetine appears to impair clearance of alprazolam by way of microsomal oxidation but does not alter clearance of clonazepam by way of nitroreduction. The very slow elimination of norfluoxetine should be considered in the design of clinical or pharmacokinetic studies that involve fluoxetine.", 
    "79": "The possible influence of long-term treatment with lansoprazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of diazepam was investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers. In this double-blind randomized crossover study, 60 mg lansoprazole or placebo was administered once daily for 10 days. One hour after administration on day 7, 0.1 mg/kg diazepam was administered intravenously, and blood was collected up to 96 hours after the injection for plasma diazepam and desmethyldiazepam measurement. During the placebo session, the plasma elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of diazepam were 26.0 +/- 1.6 hours, 22.5 +/- 1.1 ml/hr/kg, and 0.82 +/- 0.04 L/kg, respectively. These parameters were not significantly different during the lansoprazole session. The mean plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam were similar in both sessions. These findings illustrate that long-term treatment with a therapeutic dose of lansoprazole does not interfere with the metabolism of diazepam.", 
    "80": "Outbred CD-1 mice were exposed to oxazepam (15 mg/kg PO twice/day) on days 12-16 of fetal life, i.e., at a critical ontogenetic stage of Type II benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor increase, and fostered at birth to untreated dams. At adulthood, radial arm maze performance, activity-habituation test in an open-field arena (either single 15-min test or three 5-min sessions at 24-h intervals), approach to a novel stimulus object, and amphetamine or scopolamine effects thereon were assessed in male progeny. Overall, the oxazepam exposed (OX) mice were much less efficient in the radial arm maze task than the vehicle exposed (VEH) animals. Pre-test scopolamine injection, but not amphetamine, significantly impaired the arm maze performance of OX mice when compared with the corresponding VEH-scopolamine animals. In separate nonlearned behavioral tasks, prenatal oxazepam did not affect either baseline activity levels in the open field or the response to the amphetamine and the scopolamine challenge, while it considerably increased the latency of first approach to a novel object and produced a deficit of habituation in the course of the subsequent exploratory period. Concomitant investigation at the neurochemical level showed that the adult OX animals had a significant increase in both Bmax and in the affinity (Kd) of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the hippocampal formation when compared to the vehicle-exposed controls.",

According to logistic regression analysis, the relationships between plasma alprazolam concentration and response, as reflected by number of panic attacks reported, phobia ratings, physicians' and patients' ratings of global improvement, and the emergence of side effects, were significant. However, there was no significant relationship between plasma alprazolam concentration and the degree of generalized anxiety symptoms.",

The drug-treated cells remained viable, showed significantly reduced levels of the full-length and spliced HIV-1 mRNAs as detected by Northern (RNA) blot hybridization, and maintained integrated HIV-1 DNA. In immunoprecipitation studies with drug-treated cells, the levels of free 55-kDa CD4 protein increased and gp160 complexed with CD4 decreased in amount.

    "97": "We performed a retrospective chart review to determine the onset, duration, safety, and clinical sedative effects of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg intranasal midazolam in young children during laceration repair. Of 408 children treated for lacerations during an 8-month period, 42 (10%) received intranasal midazolam. Documentation was adequate for detailed analysis in 40 cases. Data are reported as mean +/- standard deviation and the frequency with 95% confidence limit (CL) estimates. The mean age of the study population was 32 +/- 9 months (range 12 months to 6 years), and the mean body mass was 14.5 +/- 3 kg. Topical or injected local anesthesia was used in 37 cases. Overall, 73% (CL 56% to 85%) of the children achieved adequate sedation. However, those receiving 0.2 to 0.29 mg/kg had adequate sedation in only 27% (CL 6% to 60%) of the cases compared with 80% (CL 52% to 95%) and 100% (CL 79% to 100%) when 0.3 to 0.39 and 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg respectively were administered. When achieved, sedation occurred within 12 +/- 4 minutes, recovery occurred at 41 +/- 9 minutes, and discharge occurred at 56 +/- 11 minutes. No vomiting or clinically significant oxygen desaturation (defined as a drop of > 4% or to < 91%) was observed. We conclude that intranasal midazolam is a safe and effective sedative for laceration repair under local anesthesia in preschool-aged children.

The drugs studied in the lighted space and threatening situation avoidance tests showed an anxiolytic effect. Picrotoxin was found to be effective in inhibiting the anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide, levopironine and campironine, but it failed to affect the antianxious action of campirone.

Using a combination of radioligand binding and electrophysiological techniques, several distinct receptors have now been identified. These include an L-glutamate-gated chloride channel which has no known counterpart in the vertebrate nervous system, and a putative kainate/quisqualate receptor with pharmacological properties different from those of the existing categories of vertebrate excitatory amino acid receptors. GABA receptors have also been characterized in the cockroach nervous system. Bicuculline, benzodiazepines and steroids have revealed important differences between certain insect GABA-gated chloride channels and vertebrate GABA receptors. Identifiable neurones may facilitate the allocation of specific functions to amino acid receptor subtypes. In view of the existence of subtypes of amino acid receptors in insects, it is of interest to examine how this is reflected at the molecular level in terms of receptor subunit composition and amino acid sequence. Preliminary molecular cloning studies on insect GABA receptors are described.", 
    "101": "It was shown that low NaCl concentrations (less than 50 mM) had more pronounced stimulatory effect on [3H]-diazepam ([3H]-DZ) binding in brain membranes of Balb/c (C) mice than in C57B1/6 (B6) mice. These interstrain differences disappeared after emotional stress in \"open field\" (OF) test. Low doses of diazepam (0.75 mg/kg) and hydazepam (1 mg/kg) induced anxiolytic effect in C mice and restored their normal [3H]-DZ binding level in the presence of NaCl. On the opposite, effects of the same doses of the benzodiazepines were not revealed either on the behavior in OF test or on stimulating properties of NaCl in B6 mice. Both benzodiazepines (10 mg/kg) induced similar behavior (sedative) and receptor (decrease of NaCl stimulating ability) in B6 and C mice. We made a conclusion that the ability of NaCl to increase [3H]-DZ binding is a physiological index which reflects hereditary differences in emotional-stress reactions and behavioral effects of benzodiazepine tranquillizers.", 
    "102": "Fischer-344 rats aged 4, 12, or 18 months were trained in a simple or choice reaction time task (SRTT; CRTT). Animals were required to detect a brief (50 ms), rarely, and unpredictably occurring signal that was presented either at the central panel light (SRTT) or above one of the two levers (CRTT). Animals reported detection by pressing either lever (SRTT) or the cued lever (CRTT) within 3 s. False alarm rates were obtained from a nonsignal 3-s bin. In comparison to younger animals, 18-month-old animals showed a reduced signal detectability, and this effect did not interact with practice. These results suggest that age affected vigilance and practice did not attenuate this effect. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (at subsedative doses; 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg) and the beta-carboline ZK 93 426 (1, 3, and 5 mg/kg) failed to affect signal detectability. Scopolamine HBr and MBr impaired detectability and responsivity to a similar extent. However, scopolamine MBr, unlike the tertiary compound, failed to affect response accuracy in the CRTT. It is speculated that the failure of chlordiazepoxide to affect performance was related to low processing demands of both tasks. Although these behavioral models show good face validity, they do not allow determination of the major components of attentional processes (perceptual sensitivity, response criterion, processing capacity). Animal behavioral paradigms that allow determination of such components are required for the investigation of the neuronal basis of age-related changes in attentional abilities.",

    "104": "The average therapeutic effect of classical tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the second and third generation varies between 60-70%. Moreover, tricycklic antidepressants are associated with undesirable effects mostly anticholinergic and \"cardiotoxic\", which may be a contraindication in particular in patients with multiple diseases and in older age groups. The authors compared two new alternative therapeutic procedures, represented by new highly effective benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants, as regards the therapeutic effect and side-effects. From this comparison ensues that their general therapeutic effect is on average comparable with the effect of tricyclic antidepressants, however, in the spectrum of their undesirable symptoms the anticholinergic effects are absent. Recent benzodiazepines have a better effect on depressions where anxiety and agitation are in the foreground. Their effect on depressive core symptoms is more marked, as compared with anticonvulsants. The most frequent side-effects are fatigue, somnolence and vertigo. Anticonvulsants have a balanced effect in different syndromological forms of depression. Undesirable effects are mostly gastrointestinal. In the authors' trials it did not lead to hypomania.",

    "110": "Administration of ethanol for 40 days, at 10.53 +/- 0.25 g/kg/day did not modify levels of dopamine (DA) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum of the rat; however, the concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) and the ratio of turnover were increased in a statistically significant way (P < 0.05). Twenty-four hours after withdrawal of ethanol appears as the central time of the ethanol-induced abstinence syndrome, showing noticeable decreases in levels of DA (P < 0.05) and DOPAC (P < 0.05), with respect to control and chronically ethanol-treated groups. The concentrations of DA, DOPAC and HVA and ratio of turnover values showed a tendency to return to control normal levels of 48 hr after ethanol withdrawal, although the differences still showed statistical significance (P < 0.05). The intraperitoneal injection of saline, the water soluble benzodiazepine midazolam, the barbiturate thiopental and somatostatin, in single doses, resulted in a noticeable increase in levels of DA, DOPAC and HVA and ratio of turnover values. The intraperitoneal injection of midazolam produced statistically significant decreases in levels of DOPAC and ratio of turnover values (P < 0.01) in rats 48 hr after withdrawal of ethanol, with respect to control and chronically ethanol-treated animals, in contrast to the absence of changes produced when injecting thiopental or somatostatin.", 
    "111": "A total of 103 cases of amitriptyline (AT) overdose (group 1) and 81 cases of overdose with a fixed combination of AT and chlordiazepoxide (CDE) (group 2), treated at our Intensive Care Unit or reported to our Poison Information Center between 1985-1990, were evaluated with respect to clinical course, symptoms and outcome, as well as efficacy of therapy. The mean amount of AT was considerably higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (13 mg kg-1 vs 7.7 mg kg-1). The most frequent symptoms in both groups were impaired consciousness, anticholinergic symptoms, seizures, arrhythmia and hypotension. Respiratory insufficiency necessitated respirator therapy in 63 of the patients. Two patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 did not survive. Therapy included primary detoxification by gastric lavage and repeated administration of activated charcoal. In four of eight patients with cardiac conduction disturbances, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate led to a significant reduction in QRS duration and AV interval. Physostigmine was effective in eight of 14 patients with pronounced anticholinergic symptoms. No effect was observed in the other six patients. Haemoperfusion, which was performed in five patients, led to rapid improvement of coma after initiation of therapy in four patients. The clinical efficacy of haemoperfusion in AT overdose despite the high volume of distribution of AT deserves further investigation. The rather high average overdose of AT implies that large package sizes of AT were available to the patients. A major step towards prevention of serious AT overdose would be the prescription of package sizes containing a total of less than 500 mg AT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "112": "The performance of three widely used rat lines (Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, and Long Evans hooded) were evaluated in behavioral test systems that are sensitive to benzodiazepines. The in vivo effects of flunitrazepam and the brain [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding were determined and compared in these rat lines. The behavioral end points evaluated in this study were anxiolysis, measured using the automated elevated plus-maze; sedation by modification of locomotor activity; hyperphagia following food deprivation; protection for pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions; and hypothermia. There were comparable results in the hypnotic, hypothermic, anticonvulsant, and feeding tests in these lines following flunitrazepam administration. However, the behavior of the Long Evans hooded rat was most amenable to the detection of drug-induced changes in the anxiety test. There was no difference in the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) or the affinity (Ki) of the Ro 15-1788 or flunitrazepam binding in either the cerebellum or whole brain (minus cerebellum) in the three rat lines as determined by the competitive binding against [3H]Ro 15-1788. Thus, while these rat lines exhibited similar behavioral profiles in most tests the modest differences in the baseline responses and the ability to detect anxiolysis at lower doses of flunitrazepam observed with Long Evans hooded rats makes them particularly suited for these types of studies.", 
    "113": "Although five muscarinic receptor subtypes have now been cloned, only three receptor subtypes have been demonstrated pharmacologically in bronchial tissue (designated M1, M2 and M3). By using drugs that show selectivity for these receptor subtypes, in combination with a sensitive and specific high-pressure liquid chromatography method that enables the direct measurement of acetylcholine (ACh) release, the existence and function of these muscarinic receptor subtypes was investigated in rabbit trachea in vitro. Atropine and ipratropium bromide, nonselective antimuscarinic agents, dose-dependently suppressed contraction of rabbit trachea induced by transmural electrical stimulation, but at the same time enhanced the release of ACh, suggesting the presence of an autoregulatory feed-back system. The M2/M4 receptor antagonists methoctramine, 11-((2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one, 5,11-dihydro-11-([(2-(2-[(dipropylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)ethyl) amino]carbonyl)-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one and 11-((4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one also dose-dependently increased ACh release during electrical stimulation, indicating that the powerful negative feedback system is mediated by presynaptic autoreceptors of the M2 or M4 type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
