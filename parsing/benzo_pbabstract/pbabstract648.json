    "0": "1 The elimination and metabolism of diazepam in man was investigated following the induction of the liver microsomal enzyme system by antipyrine. 2 Seven healthy volunteers were given 1200 mg antipyrine as an inducing agent for a period of 14 days. Before and after the induction period the elimination of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam was measured in the plasma by gaschromatography. As parameters of liver microsomal enzyme activity, antipyrine elimination and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase in the plasma, D-glucaric acid and 6-beta-hydroxycortisol urinary excretion were measured on both occasions. 3 Following the induction period most parameters of microsomal enzyme activity measured were significantly changed indicating an increase of the microsomal enzyme system. The elimination of diazepam was significantly altered having a half-life of 37 h before and 18 h afterwards combined with a significant increase in total body clearance after the induction period, although the volume of distribution remained unaltered. The formation of the main metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam was not changed, but its elimination was increased having a half-life of 139 or 58 h respectively. 4 The elimination of unchanged diazepam and desmethyldiazepam is significantly increased by the induction of the liver microsomal enzyme system using antipyrine as an inducing agent in healthy volunteers, which might be important under certain clinical conditions.", 
    "1": "Clonazepam (5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-7-nitro 2H-1,4 benzodiazepin-2-one) (2 mg/kg) reduced a p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus in mice by 50%. This antimyoclonic action of clonazepam was counteracted by the serotonin (5-HT) receptor blockers methysergide, metergoline and cinnanserin and potentiated by the 5-HT uptake inhibitors fluoxetine and chlorimipramine. Clonazepam (4 mg/kg) reduced plasma tryptophan by 27%, but had no effect on brain tryptopham, 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HT synthesis and 3H-5-HT receptor binding. Clonazepam (10(-5) M) inhibited brain synaptosomal 3H-5-HT uptake by 23% and increased 3H-5-HT release by 24%. However, 2-8 mg/kg of clonazepam administered intraperitoneally had no effect on 5-HT uptake or release. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists (muscimol, acetylenic GABA, amino-oxyacetic acid) and the GABA antagonists bicuculline and isoniazid had no effect on p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus. Furthermore, bicuculline did not counteract the antimyoclonic effect of clonazepam. We suggest that the antimyoclonic action of clonazepam is mediated by enhancement of serotonergic rather than GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "2": "Neurotransmitter receptor binding of 5 ligands was examined in the striatum, substantia nigra (SN) and frontal cortex of rats which had received either unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway (NSP) or unilateral kainic acid lesions of the striatum. 6-OHDA lesions of the NSP significantly reduced [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) and [3H]naloxone ([3H]Nal) binding by 31% and 28% respectively, in the denervated striatum compared to the contralateral side. Scatchard analysis revealed that the alteration in [3H]DHA binding was not due to a change in the affinity of the beta-adrenergic receptor for [3H]DHA. In marked contrast to these changes in the striatum, destruction of the NSP resulted in a significant increase in [3H]DHA and [3H]Nal binding by 44% and 26%, respectively, in the frontal cortex of the lesioned compared to the control side. 6-OHDA lesions in the NSP did not alter striatal receptor binding for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB), [3H]muscimol ([3H]Mus) or [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]Flu). Similarily, intrastriatal kainic acid injections did not alter striatal receptor binding for [3H]Nal, [3H]Flu or [3H]Mus. Of the various receptor densities measured in the SN after the above lesions the only alteration observed was a 43% increase in [3H]Flu binding following 6-OHDA lesions of the NSP. Scatchard analysis indicated no change in the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for [3H]Flu. 6-OHDA lesions of the NSP did not alter [13H]QNB or [3H]Nal binding in the SN. Striatal kainic acid lesions did not alter nigral [3H]QNB or [3H]Flu binding. The results are discussed in terms of neurotransmitter localization and plasticity within the striatum, SN and frontal cortex.", 
    "3": "In 100 patients with only for a short time existing pains in the region of neck, shoulder and arm and inconspicuous laboratory and X-ray findings by means of the galvanic test of the muscular function and Janda's test of the muscular function a vastly intact nerve-muscle-apparatus was proved. In the ENR-test after Brengelmann and Brengelmann clear introversion values, significantly high neurodizism values and slightly increased rigidity values were shown. Also the VELA-values were significantly higher than in the normal comparative group. In an additional inquiry predisposing biographical references for the existence of actual conflicts were found. As to the inclusion of further biographical data, 68% of intense affect reactions, 16% of functionally fixed neurotic reactions, 9% of primary and 7% of secondary neurotic maldevelopments are concerned. After a 4-week- hard-and-fast date (15 mg/a day) the complaints improved without a clear retrogression of the neurotic constellations. At the same time a change of the initially slightly increased conducting values of the skin and of the vegetative complaints appeared. A cervico-brachial psychalgia is present, when an organic muscle disease was excluded, when in the ENR-test high values to neuroticism, to introversion and rigidity are found and when a temporary connection to actual conflicts are the result.", 
    "4": "Effects were examined of atropine, diazepam, pethidene, promethazine, scopolamine, omnopon and papaverine on basal and noradrenaline-stimulated lipolysis in rat isolated fat cells and on rat adipose tissue cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity. Papaverine at high concentration (1 mM) inhibited both basal and hormone-stimulated lipolysis, whereas diazepam enhanced basal lipolysis. At a 'clinical dose', omnopon increased both basal and noradrenaline-stimulated lipolysis. Adipose tissue cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was strongly inhibited by 1 mM diazepam, papaverine, promethazine and omnopon (280 microgram ml-1). Lack of enhancement of lipolysis by the established cAMP phosphodiesterase antagonist papaverine, is compatible with simultaneous inhibition also of adipose adenyl cyclase. Diazepam-stimulated lipolysis is compatible with its phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity. It is proposed that papaverine-containing omnopon may offer some survival advantages during surgical stress by facilitating a caloric supply.", 
    "5": "Thermodynamic data relative to the reversible interaction between human or bovine serum albumin and some organic ligands (S- and R-warfarin, d- and l-oxazepam hemisuccinate, phenyl-butazone, fluorescein) in dilute aqueous solution were determined by means of gel permeation chromatography and microcalorimetric measurements. From an analysis of these data and on the basis of fluorescence titrations the identity of the \"primary\" binding site on the proteins for some ligands was evidenced, while in other cases a cooperative binding of two different ligands to different binding sites could be discerned.", 
    "6": "In experiments on mice it has been shown that synthesis of conditioned reflex and behavioural approaches is advantageous for the more complete qualitative and quantitative characteristic of group learning and performance of conditioned avoidance reaction in rodents. The efficiency of group learning and performance of this reaction depend not only on the individual characteristics of animals (ability or inability to learning) but also on the type of hierarchic relationships in the group. The possibility is suggested to use this model for investigating the modulating effect of psychotropic agents on group learning and performance of avoidance reaction.", 
    "7": "Forcing a rat to swim in a situation from which there is no escape results in an increase in plasma corticosteroid level. This rise was selectively inhibited by benzodiazepines, phenobarbital and meprobamate but not by other psychotropic drugs like trycyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, neuroleptics and amphetamines. This effect of benzodiazepines is of central origin since diazepam did not block the rise in plasma corticosteroid level produced by adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Diazepam also had no effect on plasma corticosteroid levels in hypophysectomized rats or in rats treated with betamethasone. Brief stress did not alter binding of [3H]diazepam in vitro nor binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in vivo.", 
    "8": "By sulfuration of 4-methyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepinone-2 (1) its 2-thione 2 was synthesized. From this compound 2-hydrazone 3 and s-triazole derivatives 4 and 5 were obtained. Screening revealed that only compound 2 showed strong inhibitory activity in the spontaneous motility test, weak synergism with hexobarbital, weak antinflammatory activity in the carrageenin test and strong analgesic activity in the hot plate test.", 
    "9": "Differences in the dehydration rates of tetrahydro-1,4-benzdiazepine-2-one in the liver, kidney and adrenals of mice, rats and guinea pigs have been revealed. It has been found that the enzyme catalyzing the substrate conversion into its dihydroderivative is localized in the microsomal and soluble fractions of the organs tested and has a pH optimum of 9,0. The enzyme activity depends on the concentation of phosphate ions in the incubation medium.", 
    "10": "A series of new fluorinated 2,4'7/8-trisubstituted-3H-1,5-benzodiazepinium monoperchlorates have been synthesized and characterized by IR and NMR spectral studies. Representative compounds have been screened for their CNS activity viz., behavioural, analgesic, anticonvulsant and antireserpine. 8-Chloro-2-(4'-fluorophenyl)-4-phenyl-3H-1,5-benzodiazepinium monoperchlorate has shown pronounced antireserpine activity.", 
    "11": "Intravenous administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) caused respiratory depression in both rats and cats. The maximally tolerated dose of CDP was found to be 165 +/- 15 mg/kg, i.v., in rats. Pretreatment with picrotoxin (1.5 mg/kg) or naloxone (20 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly increased the maximally tolerated dose of CDP to 330 +/- 40 mg/kg, i.v., and 270 +/- 35 mg/kg, i.v., respectively. The protective effects of both naloxone and picrotoxin were absent in bilaterally vagotomized rats. Naloxone pretreatment (25 mg/kg, i.v.) was also found to block the respiratory depressant effects of CDP in anesthetized cats, but had no effect on the cardiovascular actions of CDP. It is possible that the respiratory effects of CDP are due to its actions on GABA receptors, and that peripheral GABA receptors may mediate the protective actions of picrotoxin and naloxone.", 
    "12": "It has been established in experiments on mini pigs of Siberian origin that phenazepam given at a dose of 1 mg/kg per os during organogenesis has no embryotoxic or teratogenic action. The drug content in the blood of pregnant animals was determined simultaneously. A conclusion is drawn about perspectiveness of using mini pigs for testing embryotoxic activity of drugs.", 
    "13": "In a prospective study 44 children, aged 6 months to 5 years, admitted to hospital with febrile convulsions or epilepsy, were treated with diazepam in solution administered rectally during 59 generalised attacks. Rectal administration of diazepam was effective in the acute treatment of convulsions in 80% of cases. In 10% the treatment failed, whereas diazepam administered intravenously had prompt effect; another 10% of the convulsions wer resistant to diazepam, irrespective of the route of administration. The therapeutic effect was significantly correlated with the duration of convulsions before treatment started. Early treatment (convulsions less than or equal to 15 minutes) had effect in 96%, and late treatment (convulsions greater than 15 minutes) in 57% of cases. A total of 317 children admitted with febrile convulsions were treated prophylactically with diazepam administered rectally whenever the temperature was greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C. No case of significant respiratory depression or other serious side effects was observed. The rapid and reliable anticonvulsant effect of diazepam given rectally and the very few side effects makes this treatment a valuable alternative to IV administration in childhood.", 
    "14": "A simple, isocratic, reversed-phase, high-pressure liquid chromatographic procedure was developed for the determination of chlordiazepoxide and its major metabolites in plasma and urine. The within-run coefficient of variation was 3.4-8.0%, and the day-to-day variation was 4.0-8.0%. Recoveries of 80-91% with sensitivity limits of 50 ng/ml were obtained for the parent drug and its metabolites. Plasma and urine samples collected after single intravenous and single oral doses were analyzed using this procedure.", 
    "15": "In two studies, each on 16 healthy volunteers, the effects of pirenzepine on esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) contractile activity were studied under double blind conditions. One study was carried out on subjects who had fasted, the other on subjects who had ingested a standard meal. Each subject underwent two experiments, one with i.m. injection of 0.2 mg/kg body weight pirenzepine, the other with an injection of solvent. Heart rate, respiratory rate, electroencephalogram, and reaction time to acoustical stimuli were recorded to control for cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous effects respectively. Pirenzepine under both fasting and nonfasting conditions caused significant decreases in number, amplitude, and duration of swallow-contractions. LES pressures under both conditions were significantly lower after pirenzepine than after the solvent. Pirenzepine furthermore caused a significant heart rate deceleration and respiratory acceleration, as well as an increased power in the faster Beta- and decreased power in the Alpha-range of the EEG. In conclusion, pirenzepine inhibits esophageal and LES contractile activity and also affects the central nervous system by a direct or indirect mechanism. An application of pirenzepine in hypertensive states of the LES and the esophagus seems possible and deserves further investigation.", 
    "16": "In contrast to other benzodiazepine, Ro 5-3663 produces convulsions in mice. The CD50 of 7.0 mg/kg i.v. falls between that of picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol. An electrophysiological study was made of the effects of this convulsant benzodiazepine on spinal reflexes and on ganglionic depolarization evoked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the unanesthetized spinal cat, Ro 5-3663 (15 mg/kg i.v.)depressed the dorsal root potentials and abolished the dorsal root reflexes evoked by muscle and cutaneous afferent inputs. The monosynaptic reflex was typically depressed, whereas polysynaptic potentials were enhanced. Diazepam reversed the depression of the dorsal root reflex and dorsal root potential produced by the convulsant benzodiazepine and reduced the enhancement of the polysynaptic potential. Presynaptic inhibition was attenuated by the convulsant, whereas strychnine-sensitive postsynaptic inhibition was slightly potentiated. Ro 5-3663 reduced the amplitude and duration of the GABA-evoked negative surface potential recorded from the superior cervical ganglion. The results indicate that the convulsant benzodiazepine acts in an opposite manner to the depressant benzodiazepines and support the hypothesis that these two types of compounds act through a modulation of GABAergic mechanisms.", 
    "17": "The analgetic activity of dipidolor and diazepam as well as absence of such an effect in pipolfen were established in experiments on 200 albino rats of both sexes. The combined action of the drugs is manifested in the form of potentiated sinergism shown by increased potency and duration of analgesia.", 
    "18": "It has been shown in experiments on rats that diazepam (I mg/kg) abolishes an inhibitory action of cytalopram, the serotonine reverse uptake inhibitor (10 mg/kg) on the self-stimulation effect. Activation of self-stimulation was observed during diazepam action and in the presence of a decrease in the activity of serotoninergic processes, that was achieved by parachloramphetamine administration in doses of 5 and 15 mg/kg. It is concluded that the activating effect of diazepam is not mediated through the serotoninergic systems of the brain.", 
    "19": "Previous clinical studies establishing the efficacy of midazolam maleate (RO 21-3981), a new water-soluble benzodiazepine for induction of anesthesia, have not critically evaluated the effects of this agent on the cardiovascular system. The present study compares the cardiovascular effects of midazolam maleate and diazepam in conscious dogs. Systemic arterial, pulmonary arterial and central venous pressures, cardiac output, LVmax dP/dt, heart rate and regional coronary blood flow were measured 3 min following intravenous administration of diazepam (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/kg) or midazolam maleate (0.25, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg). Midazolam maleate increased heart rate 10--20 per cent with all three doses and decreased mean arterial blood pressure approximately 10--20 per cent at 1.0 and 10 mg/kg. Cardiac output was increased 10--12 per cent with all three doses of midazolam maleate, and LVmax dP/dt was decreased 13--16 per cent at the two higher doses. Diazepam at all three doses did not alter heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure. Diazepam, 1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg, produced significant (17 per cent) decreases in LVmax dP/dt, and 2.5 mg/kg produced a significant (10 per cent) increase in cardiac output. Neither drug in any dosage altered regional coronary blood flow, systemic or coronary vascular resistance, stroke volume, or stroke work. Maximum alterations in cardiovascular variables occurred with doses of midazolam maleate that are 10--15 times the recommended clinical induction dosage. It is concluded that in concentrations necessary for induction of anesthesia midazolam maleate has minimal effects on cardiovascular function.", 
    "20": "Discriminant function analyses were applied to data obtained from anxious psychiatric outpatients treated with either chlordiazepoxide (n = 353) or placebo (n = 259) and depressed outpatients treated with either amitriptyline (n = 310) or placebo (n = 328), who had participated in controlled drug trials of 4 weeks' duration, in an attempt to identify factors associated with complaints of drowsiness made by these patients. Although the magnitude of the relationships between individual predictors and drowsiness was small, several factors emerged which had consistent impact across treatment groups. Predictors of complaints of drowsiness attributed to active drugs arose primarily from demographic attributes probably reflective of life style, and from illness and treatment history. In contrast, predictors of drowsiness attributed to placebo were almost exclusively confined to indices of the severity of several aspects of presenting symptomatology. In particular, more frequent complaints of drug-induced drowsiness were found among better educated individuals with an illness of long duration. Complaints of placebo-induced drowsiness were more common among patients with more severe emotional (phobic-obsessive) symptomatology and more frequent headaches and among those individuals in whom hypochondriasis was less severe.", 
    "21": "A number of technical and clinical conditions reportedly associated with diazepam-related thrombophlebitis were investigated. Diazepam alone and in combination with fentanyl and methohexital was administered intravenously to 519 healthy, predominantly young adult patients undergoing routine oral surgery for removal of third molars. Indirect evidence is provided to show that two slightly different vasculopathies are involved: thrombophlebitis, in which pain and induration are both present but in which there is a slight delay in the time of inception of the condition; and phlebothrombosis, in which the reaction is almost immediate but pain is not significant and induration of the vein is the predominant feature. The overall incidence was 2.3% for thrombophlebitis and 9.8% for phlebothrombosis. There were four significant variables associated with phlebothrombosis: use of tobacco, use of oral contraceptives, multiple injections of diazepam, and pain during injection. The only significant variable associated with thrombophlebitis was the site of injection.", 
    "22": "Diazepam (5 x 10(-8) - 10(-6) M) was found to augment recurrent inhibition of pyramidal neuron firing in a dose-dependent manner in rat hippocampal slices. To determine possible loci of this effect, diazepam was locally administered by pressure ejection from a micropipette, while recording action potentials from single inhibitory (\"basket\") interneurons. Diazepam induced reversible and reliable increases in interneuron firing in response to stimulation of Schaffer collateral and commissural afferents. Taken together with previous electrophysiological reports, these data suggest that benzodiazepines may augment central inhibition by increasing either the excitability of inhibitory interneurons, or by increasing the strength of excitatory afferents to these cells.", 
    "23": "Because of the high concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei, an attempt was made to enhance GABAergic transmission in patients with cerebellar disease. Maximum tolerated doses of sodium valproate, a drug which inhibits the degradation of GABA, failed to influence cerebellar deficits in a double blind crossover study on six patients.", 
    "24": "Rats and mice were exposed to several different stress situations to investigate whether brain benzodiazepine receptors were sensitive to altered external or internal environmental circumstances. All stresses were applied for several days. Electrical foot shock and post-natal isolation of newborn pups resulted in small (7--25%; P less than 0.05--0.001) decreases in benzodiazepine receptor binding in some cerebral cortex or hippocampal areas while immobilization stress resulted in a small (9%; P less than 0.05) increase in frontal cortex. Other brain areas (i.e., striatum, cerebellum, pons-medulla, and occipital cortex) and other stress forms (isolation of male mice, forced swimming in cold water, or chronic amphetamine intoxication) did not change receptor binding. The effect of prolonged stress on benzodiazepine receptors is complex and not very pronounced.", 
    "25": "The potencies of four benzodiazepine minor tranquilizers in depressing respiratory function were investigated in rats and cats anesthetized with pentobarbital. The effect of the drug on respiration was studied in the rat, and the effect on the phrenic nerve activity which reflects the activity of an inspiratory centre was investigated in the cat vagotomized bilaterally at the level of the neck. The change of blood pressure, heart rate and pCO2 in expiration were also recorded simultaneously in experiments with the cat, an infra-red CO2 gas analyzer (Model LB-1, Beckman) was used to measure the pCO2. Respiration in the rat was decreased by the oral administration of diazepam 10, 20 mg/kg or chloridazepoxide 20, 40 mg/kg. Although the pre-administration level of ventilation was not decreased by oxazolam or chloxazolam, both 20, 40 mg/kg, p.o., the level after administration was slightly lower than that after the administration of CMC alone. Diazepam, given intravenously either as a CMC-suspension or as the preparation Cercine, in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, suppressed both the number of the burst discharges and the magnitude of the integrated signal of the discharge of the phrenic nerve of the cat. Chlordiazepoxide 1 mg/kg, i.v. also slightly decreased the magnitude of the integrated signal. Oxazolam 1 mg/kg, i.v. had little effect on the phrenic activity. Cloxazolam 1 mg/kg, i.v., on the other hand, tended to increase the magnitude of the integrated signal but only immediately after the administration. It is suggested that the potencies which depress the respiratory function vary for each minor tranquilizer, namely the ddpressive actions of oxazolan and cloxazolam are weaker than those of diazepam and chloridiazepoxide.", 
    "26": "A series of 1-substituted 6-aryl-4H-s-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines was prepared and evaluated for central nervous system activity. It was found that electronegative substituents, such as trifluoromethyl, were detrimental to activity in this series. On the other hand, many compounds with electron-donating substituents at C-1 had interesting activity. In addition to showing anxiolytic potential, some were also active in tests useful for detecting antidepressant and antipsychotic activity. Several analogues with 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl and 4-morpholinyl substituents at C-1 were of particular interest.", 
    "27": "The single drug therapy of diazepam can be introduced to effectively control convulsions in eclampsia. This treatment will have particular application in rural obstetrics where eclampsia is seen in severe form. The dose schedule of diazepam, as described in this study, shows the therapy to have a stabilizing effect on hypertension and pulse rate. It causes neither respiratory depression nor oliguria. Diazepam is an effective muscle relaxant. Its depressive effect on the newborn is in no way inferior to that of lytic cocktail therapy. The drug is readily available at low cost, even in the remote rural areas, and can be easily administered by any doctor or midwife.", 
    "28": "Utilizing standard microiontophoretic techniques and recording extracellularly in cats, we studied the effects of flurazepam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, on the spike activity of single cerebral neurones and its interactions with several excitatory and inhibitory putative neurotransmitters. Large iontophoretic doses (5--30 nA, 0.1 M solution) of flurazepam induced a depression of spike amplitude. Smaller doses (less than 5 nA, 0.1 M solution or 20--50 nA, 20 mM in 0.16 M NaCl) reduced the excitation produced by glutamate, aspartate, and homocysteate, but antagonism of acetylcholine-evoked excitations required large flurazepam doses (up to 30 nA, 0.1 M solution). Even lower doses of flurazepam (less than 10 nA, 20 mM in 0.16 M NaCl) enhanced the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but antagonized that of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and had no effect on dopamine-induced inhibition of firing. Hence, only GABA-evoked inhibitions were significantly potentiated by flurazepam. These results demonstrate the multiple possible interactions between a benzodiazepine and different putative neurotransmitters in the mammalian cerebral cortex.", 
    "29": "With modern light anaesthesia the problem of awareness during surgery has defied analysis, because no physical sign reliably signals the conscious level. A test has been developed which entails direct communication with the patient at the end of surgery, noting the earliest moment after withdrawal of nitrous oxide at which he makes the appropriate response to a verbal request, the \"time to correct response\" (TCR). This test showed premedication with lorazepam 4 mg/70 kg to be significantly better than morphine 10 mg for ensuring unconsciousness when the main anaesthetic agent was nitrous oxide, in two groups of patients undergoing abdominal surgery (P less than 0.01). All patients who had lorazepam were able, on request, to hold up the head a few minutes after surgery. Thus the benefits of light anaesthesia were retained whilst ensuring unconsciousness.", 
    "30": "Intraperitoneal administration of diazepame and phenazepame into rats /at a dose 50 mg/kg/ within 4 days did not induce liver microsomal enzymes. After administration of chlordiazepoxide at the same dose content of cytochrome P-450 was increased and the rate of dimethylaniline demethylation was elevated. Content of protein as well as NADPH-cytochrome-c-reductase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities were increased after intraperitoneal administration of all the preparations at a dose 100 mg/kg within 4 days. Experiments on the potentiation of hexenal effect demonstrated the decrease in the time of sleep in animals, treated with chlordiazepoxide at a dose 100 mg/kg of body weight.", 
    "31": "The effects of acute or chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide on several feeding parameters were studied in the rat. Given acutely, chlordiazepoxide reduced the rate of feeding, at lower dose levels (5.0 or 10.0 mg kg-1) tended to prolong feeding duration, and at a higher dose (15.0 mg kg-1) reduced the amount of food intake. Food texture can influence feeding parameters too; but the effects of the drug did not interact with the effects of food texture. After 9 daily injections of the drug, there were several indications of the development of tolerance to the effects of the drug on the feeding parameters. A possible role of 5-HT mechanisms in the reduction of eating rate produced by the drug is considered.", 
    "32": "The effect of tranquilizers on the intensity of vestibulospinal reflexes and motor activity was studied in 900 centrifuged albino mice. Chemically heterogenous tranquilizers (meprobamate, elenium, nicolit) were applied in therapeutic doses. Actometric studies have shown that the tranquilizers possess group capacity for increasing animal resistance to the action of adequate stimuli to the vestibular apparatus. Meprobamate has exhibited the most pronounced protective effect.", 
    "33": "Phenazepam undergoes aromatic and C3-hydroxylation in the microsomes of albino rats. Saturation of phenazepam oxidising enzymes proceeds at different substrate concentrations for both processes. Interaction of cytochrome P-450 with phenazepam is accompanied by spectral changes in the type II hemoprotein.", 
    "34": "Phenazepam was compared to diazepam in a double-blind study made in 32 patients. The drugs were administered by month in doses of 0.0025 mg/kg and 0.005 mg/kg. respectively 1--2 days before surgery with the use of general anesthesia. Anxiety assessed by means of the brain evoked potential test and by a clinical test according to Gologorsky's scale reduced 2 hours following both phenazepam and diazepam administration. Phenazepam elicited a more pronounced and more lasting tranquilizing effect as compared to that of diazepam. Phenazepam was concluded to be a powerful anxiolytic and sedative agent recommended for premedication before surgical interventions.", 
    "35": "The place of pharmacotherapy, behaviour therapy and biofeedback techniques in the general strategy of treating anxiety states is critically discussed. The dangers and disadvantages of barbiturates are described and the value and limitations of other drugs are considered. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs have a limited but valuable role in some patients, neuroleptics have a strictly limited place in treatment, and the role of antidepressants of various kinds is considered when anxiety is part of a depressive illness. The benzodiazepines are the most important group of drugs available for the treatment of anxiety states. The differences between various benzodiazepines are presented, with particular reference to their onset of action, half-life and the relevance of active metabolites of some of these drugs. A knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of the benzodiazepine drugs is of practical importance to the clinician. Emphasis is placed on the doctor-patient relationship and psychotherpeutic management in which drugs and other treatment serve as tactical aids in the general strategy of care.", 
    "36": "The benzodiazepines are potent anticonvulsants for a wide variety of experimental and clinical seizure disorders. The demonstration of saturable, high-affinity and stereospecific binding sites for the benzodiazepines in the mammalian central nervous system suggests the presence of pharmacological receptors mediating the anticonvulsant properties of these compounds. The good correlation between the anticonvulsant potencies of a series of benzodiazepines and their ability to inhibit 3H-diazepam binding in vitro further supports this hypothesis, but evidence for a direct interaction between benzodiazepines and their receptors, and a subsequent inhibition of seizure activity (or elevation of seizure threshold) is lacking. Recent reports from our laboratory and others have demonstrated the feasibility of labelling benzodiazepine receptors in vivo following parental administration of tritiated benzodiazepine. This technique permits one to study the relationship between the anticonvulsant activity of the benzodiazepines in vivo and the number of 'drug-occupied' receptors in vitro. We now report that there is an excellent correlation between benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by diazepam and protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that only a small fraction of benzodiazepine receptors need be occupied to produce a complete anticonvulsant effect.", 
    "37": "The release of [3H]DA synthesized from [3H]tyrosine was estimated in the two caudate nuclei (CN) during the unilateral nigral application of glycine and GABA-related compounds in 'enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9' cats using push-pull cannulae. Glycine (10(-5) M) reduced the release of [3H]DA in both CN and these effects were antagonized by strychnine (10(-5) M). A decrease in [3H]DA release was also seen in both CN during the unilateral nigral application of diazepam (10(-5) M). In contrast, muscimol (10(-6) M) and GABA (10(-5) M) stimulated [3H]DA release on both sides. The effect of GABA was blocked by picrotoxin (10(-5) M). Picrotoxin alone stimulated the release of [3H]DA in the ipsilateral CN and was without effect in the contralateral side. Bicuculline (10(-5) M) stimulated [3H]DA release only in the contralateral CN. A symmetric increase in [3H]DA release in both CN was also observed during the unilateral nigral application of potassium (30 mM). A model involving a facilitatory polysynaptic pathway originating from the substantia nigra (SN) and acting presynaptically on ther terminals of the contralateral DA neurons is proposed to explain the changes in [3H]DA release induced in the contralateral CN in these various situations. The results are discussed taking into account previous data on the reciprocal control of the two dopaminergic pathways induced by the unilateral nigral application of dopaminergic drugs.", 
    "38": "The effects of THIP and isoguvacine on 3H-flunitrazepam binding to washed membranes prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rats have been examined. THIP, which has only minimal stimulatory effects on benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor binding, has been found to inhibit the stimulation induced by small concentrations (2 microM) of exogenous GABA. While isoguvacine stimulates BZ receptor binding, although to a smaller extent than GABA, it also antagonizes the stimulation of BZ receptor binding induced by GABA. Thus THIP and isoguvacine exhibit the properties of a partial agonist of GABA-stimulated BZ receptor binding.", 
    "39": "Acquisition of autoanalgesia (behaviorally activated antinociception) was assessed across 7 consecutive days by shocking rats 10 sec after the determination of their tail-flick latencies. Thus the effect of conditioned fear on antinociception was being investigated, since each shock preceded the subsequent tail-flick test by 24 h. Autoanalgesia was acquired by the second fear-conditioning trial. Although pretreatment with naltrexone or diazepam had no effect, spinal cord transection at the thoracic level effectively obviated autoanalgesia. Investigations of opiate and opioid binding indicated significantly less binding in the fear-conditioned rats as well as an inverse relationship between binding and antinociception. These changes in binding are suggestive of partial mediation of autoanalgesia by an endogenous opiate peptide that is released by the fear-conditioning procedure.", 
    "40": "The effect of betadrenol on examination anxiety was tested in a double-blind study simulating \"examination situations\". The sample consisted of 60 normal students. After a test examination without prior treatment, each subject was given a single dose of either 40 or 100 mg betadrenol, or a benzodiazepine derivative at the recommended dosage, or a placebo. The test was repeated one hour later. Heart rate, blood pressure and skin resistance were measured continually throughout the progressively complicated psychological test. The increase in the heart rate was significantly lower in the betadrenol-treated subjects than in those given benzodiazepine or a placebo. The behaviour of the blood pressure was similar. Significant improvements in subjective condition and skin resistance in response to betadrenol were contrasted with deterioration after benzodiazepine, and no change after placebos. Improvement in mental alertness in the betadrenol group differed significantly from that in the benzodiazepine group, and there was also an improving trend in reactions. This shows that betadrenol can subdue examination anxiety. Betadrenol was far more effective than a benzodiazepine derivative in all the parameters tested, including psychophysical performance relating to control of a motor vehicle.", 
    "41": "21 patients with peptic ulcers were treated with 2X25 mg Pirenzepin daily. A decrease in basal and Pentagastrin-stimulated HCl-secretion was found. Patients with duodenal ulcers (n = 12) or gastric ulcers (n = 9) became painless within 6 to 11 days. 18 ulcers healed under treatment with Pirenzepin. Patients with duodenal ulcer showed recovery sooner than patients with gastric ulcer. One year later recurrent ulcers were observed in 4 cases. Side-effects of Pirenzepin did not occur.", 
    "42": "A short classification and brief clinical description of epileptic seizures are presented. The pharmacokinetic principles underlying modern drug treatment of epileptic seizures are discussed and the drug(s) of choice for different seizure types are listed according to their clinical efficacy. The current view of using single-drug therapy rather than polypharmacy, whenever possible, is emphasized.", 
    "43": "The method of plotting of hystograms of distribution according to the frequency intervals between pressing the redal (the method of active avoidance with no discriminating control) permits one to estimate slight shifts in the character of operative activity of rats occurring under the effect of emotional stress. The design of the simple multichannel apparatus for developing and studying of habits of active avoidance in several animals is presented.", 
    "44": "Two cases are described who developed epileptic seizures whilst taking maprotiline hydrochloride in therapeutic dosage. In both cases the electroencephalogram was normal and the fits stopped on withdrawal of the drug.", 
    "45": "A death case following a suicidal overdose of flurazepam (Dalmadorm) is reported. The body was found after 3 month near a highway. The course of the intoxication is in question as benzodiazepines are believed to be relatively save drugs. The death might have occured rapidly because of the acute toxic actions of the drug overdose as well as after a protracted course involving additional complications like inflammatory alteration of the myocard or hypothermia during a coma. Flurazepam and its major metabolites were analysed in blood and urine. The toxic levels of flurazepam (0.51 mg/l), N1-desalkylflurazepam (0.14 mg/1) and N1-hydroxyethylflurazepam (9.0 mg/1) in the blood amounted to 20--50 times higher than therapeutic levels, with flurazepam and metabolites being in only slight altered relation to each other. The overdose is considered to have been above 2.4 g (80 tablets). The resorption of the drug was complete. The analytical findings in blood and urine as well as in the GI-tract are in satisfactory agreement. The analytical data of flurazepam and its metabolites are discussed in detail, taking metabolic and pharmacokinetic parameters, autopsy findings and case circumstances into consideration. A final decision about the course of the intoxication is not possible. This case shows however the fatal consequences of a flurazepam overdose although alcohol or other drugs were not involved.", 
    "46": "Brain-specific binding sites have been isolated on synaptosomal membrane fragments which recognize pharmacologically active benzodiazepines (BDZ's) and triazolopyridazines (TPZ's). While early evidence indicated the existence of a single homogeneous class of BDZ binding sites, more recent biological and pharmacological studies support the notion of BDZ receptor multiplicity. We now propose that two biochemically distinct BDZ receptors exist in brain which are responsible for the mediation of different pharmacological activities. Type I BDZ receptors display a high affinity for both BDZ's and TPZ's, are not coupled to GABA receptors or to chloride ionophores, and are the sites which mediate anxiolytic actions. Type II BDZ receptors display a high affinity for BDZ's, display a low affinity for TPZ's, are coupled to GABA receptors and/or chloride ionophores, and are the sites which mediate pharmacological effects other than anxiolytic activity.", 
    "47": "The acute treatment of rats with diazepam induces pronounced changes in brain enkephalin concentrations, as was estimated for methionine(met)-enkephalin and in some representative experiments for leucine(leu)-enkephalin, employing highly specific radioimmunoassays. Diazepam selectively increased the enkephalin concentrations in the hypothalamus by about 35%, and lowered it in the corpus striatum by roughly 25%; no changes could be detected in the medulla oblongata/pons or midbrain. The drug-induced changes displayed a rapid onset. Peak effects were reached by 2 to 5 min after injection. Changes observed in the hypothalamus were only short lasting and were apparently parallelled by diazepam concentrations in the brain, whereas the decrease in the striatum was of markedly longer duration. Presently, the mechanism underlying all these changes is unknown. Whereas an increase in enkephalin concentrations in the hypothalamus may be discussed in terms of the anti-stress effect of benzodiazepines, the observed drop in striatal enkephalin is not obviously to be correlated to behavioural changes induced by these drugs.", 
    "48": "Ketamine did not provide adequate anaesthesia for pneumoencephalography in a 10-week-old child with agenesis of the corpus collosum. Associated neurological defects are the most likely reason for this failure."
