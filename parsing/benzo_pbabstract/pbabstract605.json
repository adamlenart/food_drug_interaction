    "0": "Two female infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) were treated with diazepam for the control of seizures. The first infant had seizures, lethargy, and respiratory distress in the first 24 hours of life. The diagnosis of NKH was made at 3 weeks of age and she was then placed on a regimen of strychnine and a low-protein diet. Strychnine therapy was discontinued after three months of treatment because there was no improvement in the seizure control or in the patient's condition. At 5 months of age the patient was referred to our clinic for further work-up. The second infant had seizures, hypotonia, and respiratory distress shortly after birth. She was treated with phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin, which had no effect on her seizures. The baby was referred to our clinic at 8 months of age and diagnostic studies revealed NKH. All previous medications were stopped and both infants were placed on diazepam, a competitor for glycine receptors in the CNS. Choline and folic acid were added for one-carbon unit transfer and sodium benzoate to bind excessive glycine. Both infants responded to this treatment with cessation of seizures; they became more responsive and alert, and their EEGs showed remarkable improvement despite the persistence of elevated glycine levels in plasma, CSF, and urine. Diazepam as a competitor for the receptors of glycine may prove helpful in controlling the intractable seizures associated with NKH.", 
    "1": "Several esters of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and tested in respect to their affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor in bovine cortex membranes. Out of these derivatives, the methyl, ethyl, and n-propyl ester were clearly the most potent, while the n-butyl, benzyl, and 3-pyridylmethyl ester were considerably less active. Moreover, several beta-carboline-3-carboxylates with ethanol derivatives as ester alcohol components were all less active than the ethyl or n-propyl ester themselves. It is concluded that the affinity of beta-carboline-3-carboxylates to the benzodiazepine receptor is profoundly dependent on molecular size, as well as hydrophobic and electronic parameters of the ester alcohol component.", 
    "2": "Nicotinamide is a ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor and has been reported to have anticonvulsant activity. In addition, our previous clinical experience has raised the possibility that it may also potentiate the action of barbiturates. Therefore, we have examined the anticonvulsant activity and neurotoxicity of nicotinamide alone and in combination with phenobarbital in mice. Nicotinamide had its maximal anticonvulsant effect 15 min and its maximal sedative effect 45 min after intraperitoneal injection. At 15 min, the median effective dose was 586.5 mg/kg against bicuculline and 2,019 mg/kg against pentylenetetrazol. Nicotinamide was ineffective against maximal electroshock. It had a sedative effect, with a median toxic dose of 874.8 mg/kg by the Rotorod Toxicity Test at 45 min. At doses that were ineffective by themselves (0.01 effective dose) nicotinamide potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of phenobarbital against bicuculline and pentylenetetrazol, but the toxicity was not potentiated and therefore the therapeutic index of phenobarbital was improved by nicotinamide. These results suggest that nicotinamide may be useful as a therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of epilepsy with phenobarbital or primidone.", 
    "3": "In our laboratory, we have studied the mechanism of action of tumor-inhibitory antibiotics, including bleomycin, phleomycin, adriamycin, aclarubicin, neothramycin, macromomycin, auromomycin, chartreusin, pluramycin, neopluramycin, xanthomycin A, angustmycins A and C, blasticidin S and phenomycin. The recent advances are summarized. Screening of microorganism for new antitumor antibiotics based upon our studies on mechanism of action are currently ongoing. We are interested in drug-resistance of tumor cells, and have obtained drug-resistant sublines of murine lymphoblastoma L5178Y cells. We have found that glycoprotein synthesis and alkaline phosphodiesterase (APD) activity of the plasma membrane are higher in adriamycin (ADM)-, aclarubicin (ACR)- and bleomycin (BLM)-resistant cell sublines than in the parental cells. An inhibitor of APD has been isolated from a soil Streptomyces, and identified with 2-crotonyloxymethyl-4,5,6-trihydroxycyclohex-2-enone (COTC). COTC inhibits growth of the drug-resistant cells more significantly than the parental cells, and exhibits synergistic activity with ACR against ACR-resistant cells. COTC is a SH inhibitor. Although COTC is a multifunctional drug, the inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha and some mitotic process may be related to its lethal action. In the course of our screening, we have found that a strain of Sterptomyces hygroscopicus produces two substances: one inhibits thymidine and uridine uptake of human leukemic K562 cells, and the other stimulates it. The inhibiting substance has been identified with tubercidin, and the stimulating one has been found to be a novel pyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidine antibiotic, cadeguomycin. Cadeguomycin shows low acute toxicity in mice, enhances DTH reaction, and inhibits Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma in mice. The antibiotic exhibits synergistic effects with arabinosylcytosine against growth of K562 cells. Saframycin, discovered by Prof. Arai, Chiba University, is effective against Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma, P388 and L1210 leukemia, and B16 melanoma in mice. The target is DNA. Stubomycin, discovered by Dr. Umezawa, Kitasato Institute, is effective against Sarcoma 180, Ehrlich carcinoma, P388 leukemia, IMC carcinoma and Meth-A tumor in mice, and shows low acute toxicity. The target is plasma membrane.", 
    "4": "The effect of zotepine (2-chloro-11-(2-dimethyl-aminoethoxy) dibenzo [b, f] thiepin), a new neuroleptic, and other neuroleptics, minor tranquilizers, antidepressants, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamine drugs, antiparkinsonian drugs, alpha-, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, hypnotics and central muscle relaxants on apomorphine (APM)- and methamphetamine (MAP)-induced rotational behaviour was investigated in rats with unilateral lesions of the substantia nigra. Only the neuroleptics dose-dependently depressed both rotational behaviours. The minor tranquilizers also depressed both behaviours, but their effect was non-specific. The neuroleptics could be divided into two groups according to their relative effect on the APM- and MAP-induced rotational behaviour. The high-ratio group (fluphenazine, haloperidol, perphenazine, pimozide and zotepine) depressed the MAP-induced rotational behaviour more strongly than the APM-induced one, whereas the depressive effect of the low-ratio group (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, thioridazine and clozapine) was the reverse. Zotepine, while belonging to the high-ratio group, was markedly lower in ratio than the other neuroleptics in this group. The correlation between the different effect of the two groups of neuroleptics and their clinical effect is discussed.", 
    "5": "Ex vivo benzodiazepine receptor occupation by six benzodiazepine hypnotics in the mouse brain was investigated with respect to the time course after oral administration and with respect to the in vitro potency as benzodiazepine receptor ligands. All drugs were administered as solutions. Receptor occupation, as indicated by the inhibition of specific [3H] flunitrazepam binding, occurs very rapidly after oral administration of all benzodiazepines tested with about 80% or even more of maximal inhibition already seen within 30 min after oral administration. However, the onset is somewhat faster with midazolam and temazepam than with the other four derivatives. The duration of benzodiazepine receptor occupation in the mouse brain differed markedly for the six benzodiazepines in agreement with their very different pharmacokinetics in this species. Except for midazolam, there was a good correlation between in vitro receptor affinity and ex vivo receptor occupancy, suggesting that all drugs except midazolam reach the receptor in the CNS similarly. Midazolam has a large first pass metabolism after oral administration which seems the reason for the lower ex vivo potency relative to the in vitro affinity. It is concluded that a fast onset of receptor occupation is a rather general property of benzodiazepines when administered orally as solutions.", 
    "6": "Alprazolam underwent a facile 1,4-benzodiazepine ring-opening reaction in an acidic aqueous solution to form a benzophenone compound. The reaction was demonstrated by means of UV, IR, and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Its reverse cyclization reaction to alprazolam occurred when an acidic solution was neutralized. Both the ring-opening and the cyclization rate constants were obtained from the overall rate constant measured at 25 degrees over a pH range of 0.5--8.0; the latter was measured by monitoring the UV spectral change of the reaction. Although the equilibrium was favored for the benzophenone compound in acidic solutions, it was possible to directly measure the cyclization rate at three acidic pH values by providing a sink condition for the product, alprazolam, using a biphasic reaction system. The bell-shaped cyclization rate pH profile was interpreted in terms of a change in the rate-determining step. The pH profile of the ring-opening rate showed an inflection point indicating a different reactivity of mono- and dicationic alprazolam. The apparent equilibrium between alprazolam and the benzophenone compound at a given pH was estimated from the rate constants for the ring-opening and cyclization reactions. The results agree with the apparent pKa measured by a conventional UV spectrophotometry and a titration technique. The pKa of monocationic alprazolam, the reactive species for the covalent hydration, was determined from the pH dependence of the initial absorbance when an alprazolam solution is acidified.", 
    "7": "1 During 1978--1980 general toxicological investigations were performed on specimens from 211 patients (62 male, 149 female) aged 65 years and over. 2 The investigations were an important factor in establishing the diagnosis in 32 of 91 (28 male, 63 female aged 65--92 years, median 73 years) poisoned patients, most (75) of whom had deliberately taken overdoses. 3 Seventy-one patients were severely poisoned (grade 3--4 coma) and 10 died. Benzodiazepines (49%) and barbiturates (43%) were the drugs encountered most frequently, although 54% had ingested more than one pharmaceutical preparation. 4 In the survivors the depth of coma was usually greatest in patients poisoned principally with barbiturates, whilst the duration of coma and the incidence of respiratory complications were greater in those poisoned with benzodiazepines. However, there was considerable variability in the depth and duration of coma associated with a given initial plasma concentration within both groups. 5 Although general toxicological investigations can provide useful diagnostic information when poisoning is suspected in elderly patients, unequivocal interpretation of the results obtained is not always possible.", 
    "8": "Multiunit activity was recorded simultaneously in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus dorsalis CA 1 area, the nucleus locus coeruleus and the nucleus raph\u00e9 dorsalis of enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9 rats; drugs were injected intravenously in increasing doses. Chlordiazepoxide decreased multiunit activity dose-dependently to a similar extent in substantia nigra, hippocampus and dorsal raph\u00e9, but was less effective in the locus coeruleus. Midazolam reduced multiunit activity in all 4 nuclei to a similar degree and was more potent than chlordiazepoxide. Specific benzodiazepine antagonists completely reversed the effects of the two benzodiazepines. Pentobarbitone was a less potent depressant than chlordiazepoxide, and its effect was not reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788.", 
    "9": "The enterohepatic circulation of radioactive material after administering [14C]temazepam was evaluated in three sets of male Wistar strain rats connected in pairs by bile duct-duodenum cannulae. After a single oral dose (10 mg kg-1) to the donor rat, the excretion of radioactivity in the urine and faeces of both rats and in the bile of the recipient rat was determined. Mean total recovery of the administered radioactivity was 92.2%. Based on the amount remaining in the donor rat (gastrointestinal tract and faeces), 81.7% of the dose was absorbed by the donor. The total amount recovered from the recipient, 69.4% of original dose (85.1% of donor's absorbed dose), represented the amount excreted in the donor's bile. Similarly, 54.1% of the original dose (77.9% of the transferred biliary excretion from donor) was reabsorbed by the recipient, and the biliary excretion from this animal (45.9% original dose) accounted for 86.% of the amount reabsorbed.", 
    "10": "Classical pharmacological dependence accompanied by euphoria, clinical evidence of tolerance and escalation of dosage are very rare with the benzodiazepines. However, there is now abundant evidence that prolonged administration of doses within the therapeutic range leads to true dependence in a significant minority of patients. This dependence is characterised by withdrawal symptoms on stopping treatment; these include perceptual disturbances, epileptic seizures, weight loss, insomnia and autonomic symptoms. As some of the symptoms are qualitatively different from those of anxiety neurosis, and as the withdrawal syndrome commonly lasts between 5 and 15 days, the possibility that the symptoms represent a return of pre-existing anxiety can be discounted. The withdrawal syndrome is more likely if: (a) the benzodiazepine has been taken in regular dosage for more than 4 months; (b) higher dosages have been used; (c) the drug is stopped suddenly; and (d) a short acting benzodiazepine has been taken. The withdrawal syndrome is most likely to occur when there is a rapid fall in blood benzodiazepine concentrations; this may be associated with altered sensitivity of benzodiazepine receptors. The syndrome can best be avoided by gradual reduction of dosage. The temporary prescription of other drugs, particularly beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, may attenuate withdrawal symptoms, but antipsychotic drugs in low dosage are of no benefit.", 
    "11": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 48 anxious outpatients with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with bromazepam (18 mg/day), diazepam (15 mg/day), or placebo, after a 1-week washout period. From week 1 onward both active drugs were superior to placebo in relieving anxiety symptoms. Bromazepam was found to be significantly more effective than diazepam with respect to the somatic anxiety factor and the total score for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the fear/anxiety factor of the Patient's Self-Rating Symptom Scale. Plasma concentrations of diazepam plus active metabolites were correlated significantly (r = 0.60, p less than 0.05) with the percentage reduction in self-rating anxiety scores. Bromazepam plasma concentration measurements showed greater variability than those of diazepam and were not found to be correlated significantly with clinical response. It is suggested that the use of strict diagnostic criteria (1978 draft of the third edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), adequate sample sizes, and a 4-week study period gave increased sensitivity for the detection of significant differences between the two benzodiazepines.", 
    "12": "The interaction between lorazepam (1.0 mg) and low doses of alcohol (1/6 or 1/2 gill of vodka, equal to 6.5 or 19.6 g, respectively) was investigated in a variety of performance tests using a double-blind crossover design. The effects on mood ratings and bodily symptoms were also studied. The subjects were normal student volunteers. Lorazepam significantly impaired performance in a digit symbol substitution test and in number and verbal learning tasks. In the latter, long term recall was also impaired. Alcohol increased subjects' simple reaction time. Self-ratings of sedation were significantly increased by both lorazepam and alcohol alone, and these sedative effects were additive when the drugs were combined. Both lorazepam and alcohol had anxiolytic effects when taken alone, but when combined they made subjects more anxious than they were on placebo. This anxiogenic action of the drug combination was found on two occasions under test conditions where significantly different levels of state-anxiety were observed. These results suggest that benzodiazepine treatment should not be combined with even small quantities of alcohol because of the risk of both psychomotor impairment and possible anxiogenic effects.", 
    "13": "Flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam are compared in terms of initial and short term efficacy, effectiveness during intermediate and long term use, withdrawal effects, and general side effects. The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hang-over). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.", 
    "14": "This article reviews the clinical literature of flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam. The long half-life drug flurazepam and the short half-life drug triazolam produced similar results in terms of clinical improvement and adverse effects when equivalent dosages were administered. Temazepam, in the present U.S. formulation, appeared to be less effective in sleep latency than the other two compounds.", 
    "15": "The kinetic properties of three benzodiazepine hypnotics are reviewed. Flurazepam serves as a precursor for at least two rapidly appearing and rapidly cleared metabolites that may contribute to sleep induction and are nonaccumulating. The final metabolite of flurazepam (N-desalkylflurazepam), however, has a long half-life and accumulates during repeated dosage. Temazepam has a relatively slow rate of absorption and an intermediate half-life in the range of 10 to 20 hours. Triazolam has an intermediate rate of absorption; due to its ultrashort half-life (1.5 to 5 hours), triazolam is a non-accumulating hypnotic. Taken together with sleep laboratory studies and clinical trials, knowledge of the kinetic profile of benzodiazepine hypnotics can assist in evaluating their clinical benefits and disadvantages.", 
    "16": "Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, was compared with diazepam in fat emulsion (Diazemuls) as sedation for outpatient gastroscopy in a randomized double-blind fashion. Midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 was found to be approximately equipotent to Diazemuls 0.15 mg kg-1. There were no differences concerning speed of recovery and all patients were considered ready for discharge after 2 h. Venous tolerance was good for both drugs. With the same degree of sedation, midazolam produced a higher frequency of amnesia (60% v. 7%; P less than 0.001) for the endoscopic procedure. Although the patients appeared to prefer midazolam to Diazemuls, this difference was significant only in patients who had not previously undergone gastroscopy (P less than 0.05). The high degree of amnesia with midazolam may be an advantage in sedation for unpleasant procedures like gastroscopy.", 
    "17": "One hundred patients aged 5-13 yr were randomly allocated to four groups in a double-blind study of premedication. Drugs studied were lorazepam, diazepam and trimeprazine. A placebo group was included. All the drugs appeared satisfactory as premedicants. Lorazepam induced the most sedation immediately after surgery, but by 4 h lorazepam and diazepam appeared similar. Lorazepam produced better amnesia than the other drugs. There were no untoward side-effects and no cardiorespiratory depression in any group. Lorazepam appears a suitable premedicant for children.", 
    "18": "The binding of the novel ligand [3H]Ro 5-4864 to membrane preparations of rat kidney and brain was studied. [3H]Ro 5-4864 binds with high affinity (Kd = 0.6 nM) to a single saturable population of benzodiazepine recognition sites on renal membranes. Binding is rapidly reversible and, based on its pharmacological spectrum, takes place at the peripheral-type, Ro 5-4864-sensitive receptor. Specific high-affinity (Kd = 1.1 nM) [3H] Ro 5-4864 binding to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site can also be demonstrated using rat brain membranes. [3H] Ro 5-4864 lacks stereospecificity with regard to chiral activity in position 3. A comparison of benzodiazepine inhibitory potency and structural features reveals that whereas a 4'-substitution assures specificity for the peripheral-type receptor, an N-methyl moiety is essential for optimal activity. [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to brain membranes is temperature sensitive and is not modulated by barbiturates, convulsants, gamma-aminobutyric acid and chloride anions. The pyrazolopyridine derivative tracazolate inhibits [3H] Ro 5-4864 binding. The regional and subcellular distribution of binding is distinctly different from that previously demonstrated for [3H]benzodiazepine binding in the brain. The olfactory bulb shows the highest binding density, whereas the cerebral cortical, striatal and hippocampal areas are lowest among those areas studied. In the brain, [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding was found to sediment with the nuclear fraction. In conclusion, the present study shows that [3H]Ro 5-4864 is a selective ligand of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site that can unequivocally be demonstrated in the kidney as well as the brain. The physiological significance of these findings, however, remain to be established.", 
    "19": "The actions of etazolate (SQ20009) on cultured cortical neurons have been examined in electrophysiological experiments and in receptor binding studies. Etazolate (0.3 to 100 microM) prolongs the duration of spontaneously occurring IPSPs. Higher concentrations of etazolate produce an increase in membrane chloride conductance, an effect which is picrotoxinin and bicuculline sensitive. Etazolate potentiates the response to exogenously applied GABA and acts synergistically with diazepam to enhance GABA-mediated conductance. Etazolate does not increase glycine-mediated conductance changes. Etazolate increases [3H]flunitrazepam binding and stimulates the GABA enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. In addition, GABA stimulates the etazolate enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. The etazolate-mediated increases in binding are Cl- dependent and picrotoxinin and bicuculline sensitive. The dose response relationships for etazolate-mediated effects are similar in physiological experiments and in binding studies. These data suggest that etazolate interacts with the postsynaptic GABA receptor complex at a site distinct from either the GABA recognition site or the benzodiazepine binding site to enhance GABA-mediated inhibition and to increase benzodiazepine binding.", 
    "20": "Psychotropic drugs are widely prescribed and tend to be used on a long-term basis. The barbiturates are known to induce tolerance and dependence, with a well-defined and often severe withdrawal syndrome from high doses. By contrast, the benzodiazepines are infrequently associated with tolerance and dependence at high doses. Recent work, however, has suggested that a definite withdrawal syndrome can supervene on discontinuation of long-term normal doses of benzodiazepines. In view of the widespread and chronic use of the benzodiazepines, this may represent a major problem. The theoretical implications of such normal-dose dependence are discussed.", 
    "21": "Early morning insomnia, a significant increase in wakefulness during the final hours of drug nights, occurred after 1 or 2 weeks of nightly administration of benzodiazepine hypnotics with short elimination half-lives, when tolerance had begun to develop. Early morning insomnia may be a variant of rebound insomnia and therefore specific to benzodiazepines, or it may occur with any rapidly eliminated sedative-hypnotic agent.", 
    "22": "The histamine H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine potently inhibited [3H]muscimol and enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding in membranes prepared from several brain regions in the rat, including the dorsal raphe nucleus. As further examined in cortical membranes, this effect on both GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites was specific for imidazole-derived H2-receptor antagonists (potency: cimetidine greater than metiamide greater than tiotidine) and not observed with either several H1-receptor antagonists or histamine. These data indicate a striking similarity between the actions of cimetidine (and other imidazole-derived H2-receptor antagonists) and GABA on binding parameters at the GABA receptor complex.", 
    "23": "The water soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, was compared with thiopentone as an intravenous induction agent in unpremedicated patients undergoing cystoscopy as out-patients. Induction time was longer with midazolam, though subsequent transition to halothane inhalation anaesthesia was smooth and uneventful. Both drugs had similar effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and were without local irritation following intravenous injection. Recovery was more prolonged with midazolam, tests of memory and unaided mobility showing greater impairment one hour after anaesthesia. Notwithstanding a slower and less predictable onset of unconsciousness and somewhat slower recovery phase, midazolam provides a safe alternative to thiopentone as an induction agent suited to minor surgical procedures.", 
    "24": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, were studied with respect to three pharmacological activities exerted by diazepam in rats. Two of these, release of shock-induced suppression of drinking and attenuation of non-reward-induced cessation of responding for food, reflect the anxiolytic property of benzodiazepines. The amnesic-like effect of diazepam was also investigated. Ro 15-1788 (in doses ranging from 4 to 16 mg/kg p.o.) completely reversed diazepam (2 mg/kg)-induced release of behavior in both punishment and non-reward procedures. In contrast, Ro 15-1788 reduced but did not completely abolish diazepam-induced amnesia. These data suggest that the anticonflict and anti-frustration effects of benzodiazepines probably involve similar receptor types which nevertheless differ from those chiefly implicated in the amnesic-like activity of benzodiazepines.", 
    "25": "Lorazepam was compared with diazepam for the treatment of status epilepticus in a double-blind, randomized trial. Seventy-eight patients with 81 episodes were enrolled. Patients received one or two doses of either 4 mg of lorazepam or 10 mg of diazepam intravenously. Seizures were controlled in 89% of the episodes treated with lorazepam and in 76% treated with diazepam. The times for onset of action of the medications did not differ significantly. Adverse effects occurred in 13% of the lorazepam-treated patients and in 12% of the diazepam-treated patients. Respiratory depression and arrest, the most frequent adverse effects, were treated symptomatically; no adverse sequelae were noted.", 
    "26": "Status epilepticus is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. General treatment is aimed at restoring physiologic homeostasis, and drug therapy is aimed at arresting the convulsive activity and preventing its recurrence. Concurrent administration of diazepam and either phenytoin or phenobarbital will be effective in most cases. After the status epilepticus has been treated the underlying cause should be investigated and, if possible, treated.", 
    "27": "Rats were treated with repeated intraventricular injections of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) (10 micrograms/rat, twice daily for 8 days), 36 h after the last injection, the total number of 3H-diazepam binding sites was increased in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus by 63, 51 and 38%, respectively. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the dissociation constants (KD) between beta-CCE and solvent treated rats. In contrast, chronic beta-CCE administration failed to change the number of the apparent affinity of 3H-beta-CCE binding sites in all the brain areas examined. The results suggest that beta-CCE is an antagonist at the 3H-diazepam binding sites.", 
    "28": "The drugs most commonly used in self poisoning are the psychotropics, but the proportion of patients given these drugs who take overdoses is unknown. In a prospective study of 43117 people in Oxfordshire, prescriptions issued by general practitioners were linked with records of hospital admissions and deaths. During two years there were 79 episodes of deliberate self poisoning leading to hospital admission or death. The number of patients who took overdoses of psychotropic drugs was small in relation to the total number prescribed such drugs. Of 5600 people aged 10 or older who received psychotropic drugs during one year, 17 (3.0 per 1000) poisoned themselves with these drugs within 12 months. The rate of self poisoning with psychotropic drugs declined significantly with increasing age (p less than 0.001). Almost three quarters of the patients who took overdoses of prescribed psychotropics received further psychotropic drugs during the three months after their admission to hospital.", 
    "29": "Therapeutic drug monitoring can involve quantitation in either microgram, nanogram or picogram concentrations present in a complex biological matrix (whole blood, urine or tissue). The chemical structure of a compound influences not only the analytical method best suited to its quantitation, but also its acid/base character (pKa) and its extractability. The dose administered, the bioavailability of the dosage form, and the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug govern the circulating concentrations of either the parent drug and/or its metabolites present in vivo, and dictate the ultimate sensitivity nd specificity required of the analytical method. The degree of sample preparation required is dependent on the analytical method used (gas--liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography) and on the tolerance of the specific type of detection system to contamination. Factors leading to compound losses during sample preparation (adsorption, stability) are critical at low concentrations and can adversely affect the reliability of an assay, therefore maximizing the overall recovery of the assay is essential not only for high sensitivity but also for good precision and accuracy. Therefore, the criteria to be used in sample preparation should aim to optimize all of the above factors in the overall development of a reliable and validated method for the compound suitable for use in clinical therapeutic monitoring.", 
    "30": "The case of a seventeen-year-old girl in whom typical particularly disabling Gilles de la Tourette syndrome had developed three years earlier is reported. The usual therapeutic agents (benzodiazepines, clomethiazole, paraldehyde, choline chloride) had proved totally or partially ineffective. Under 300 mg of tiapride per day given intramuscularly, the hyperkinesia and phonatory tics resolved rapidly. Conversion to a daily dosage of 900 mg of tiapride given orally ensured the permanence of this improvement and the patient was able to resume a nearly normal life.", 
    "31": "The high-affinity binding site for [3H]Ro 5-4864 has been solubilized from rat kidney using 1% Triton X-100. After lowering the concentration of detergent and using a poly(ethylene glycol) gamma-globulin assay, it has been possible to demonstrate solubilization of about 90% of the binding sites. A single soluble class of binding sites with a Kd of 1.8 nM is found. The order of potency of benzodiazepines is identical for the solubilized receptor and the membrane-bound form. Gel filtration revealed a major peak of binding activity with apparent molecular weight of 215000 and a Stokes' radius of 5.03 nm.", 
    "32": "Benzodiazepines reliably produce overconsumption of food and fluids. Opiate antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, block the benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia and hyperdipsia at low doses. Hence, activation of endogenous opioid mechanisms may be closely involved in the benzodiazepine facilitatory effects on ingestional behavior. Evidence is reviewed that opiate antagonists diminish feeding and drinking responses, and may enhance satiety processes in feeding and drinking, in addition to selectively diminishing the palatability of attractive foods and fluids. It is proposed that a single mechanism of action of the opiate antagonists would be sufficient to account for both effects on feeding and drinking. Biochemical data confirm that acute benzodiazepine treatment in vivo is associated with a naloxone-reversible release of striatal enkephalin. It is possible therefore that there is a close association between the behavioral and biochemical data, which both show that acute benzodiazepine effects are reversed by opiate antagonists. The implied relationship between benzodiazepine and endogenous opioid mechanisms may be relevant to the question of concurrent opiate-benzodiazepine abuse.", 
    "33": "Inhibition of GABA transaminase which led to a several-fold increase of GABA levels in the goldfish optic tectum or diazepam pre-treatment, were unable to protect tectal neurons from kainic acid neurotoxicity, as judged by light and electron microscopic observations and by the drop of marker enzymes for neurotransmitters. In an in vitro preparation of tectal slices GABA, added to the incubation medium, had no effect on a metabolic parameter (CO2 production from exogenous glucose) related to the excitatory action of kainic acid. It is concluded that, in the goldfish optic tectum, pharmacological manipulation cannot enhance the activity of GABAergic circuits to the extent necessary to block the neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic action of kainic acid.", 
    "34": "Caffeine, a potent central stimulant, is known to competitively inhibit the specific binding of both adenosine and benzodiazepine receptor ligands to brain membranes in vitro. In mice receiving a diet containing non-toxic doses of caffeine (200 or 400 mg/kg diet) for periods up to 40 days, a dose-related increase in the number of binding sites for [3H]-CHA and [3H] DPX was observed in whole brain membranes without modifications of the receptors' affinity. Furthermore, a transitory increase in the number of [3H]-DZP binding sites was observed. These preliminary data seem to confirm the involvement of the adenosine receptors in the mode of action of caffeine and may be relevant to the development of both tolerance and dependence to some of the central effects of this compound.", 
    "35": "The benzodiazepines are a class of drugs used to alleviate anxiety. As such they constitute one of the most commonly prescribed compounds, due in part to their efficacy and safety. The physiological effect of these drugs is probably through interactions with a low affinity benzodiazepine binding site and two (types 1 and 2) higher affinity sites. The ontogenesis of these latter two binding sites in the rat differs, with the type 2 binding site being predominant at birth and the type 1 binding site increasing in number after the second week after birth. The differential development of these two receptor types is important because the immature organism may have different physiological and behavioural responses from the adult. Here we demonstrate an important difference: that a prototypic benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, and a water-soluble benzodiazepine, flurazepam, produce behavioural convulsions in the preweanling rat. The convulsions are antagonized by the benzodiazepine blocker Ro-15-1788. The triazolopyridizine CL-218872, specific to the type 1 receptor, does not share this action. We suggest that this paradoxical convulsant effect of chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam is due to activation of the type 2 receptor in the absence of the type 1 receptor in the immature rat.", 
    "36": "A systematic approach for evaluating the abuse of drugs in patients presenting to the hospital emergency room is presented from the laboratory point of view. This comprehensive screen involves qualitative colorimetric tests, ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry, thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Laboratories with varying resources can adopt the screen presented. Thirty-two cases were evaluated with the methodology; these included tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, phencyclidine, methaqualone, and barbiturates. Increasing misuse of drugs requires that the clinical laboratory have a systematic approach to identify and confirm the presence of these drugs in emergency room patients.", 
    "37": "The effect of tobacco smoking on alprazolam pharmacokinetics is investigated. Ten healthy men (five smokers and five nonsmokers) between 19 and 42 years old received a single oral 1-mg alprazolam dose followed 48 hours later by alprazolam 0.5 mg every eight hours for six days. Multiple serum samples were collected following the initial dose and after the last 0.5-mg dose and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography for alprazolam. Pharmacokinetic values were calculated, and mean data from the smoking and nonsmoking groups were compared. Mean plasma alprazolam concentrations during the single-dose phase were comparable between groups. During the multiple-dose phase, mean plasma concentrations were 15-30% lower in the smokers. Total body clearance of alprazolam was 24% greater and the apparent volume of distribution was 17% less in smokers. The elimination half-life was 49% greater in nonsmokers. These differences were not significant. Changes were not observed in elimination half-life or clearance after alprazolam cessation. Steady-state pharmacokinetic values during the multiple-dose phase correlated with values observed following the single dose. Although not significantly different, alprazolam elimination was more rapid in smokers than in nonsmokers.", 
    "38": "Using two infusion anaesthesiamethods for laryngomicroscopy in 187 non-selected patients we studied the recovery phase with the aid of a special questionnaire filled in by the recovery room nurse. Premedication was with Thalamonal and atropine. Muscle relaxation was achieved by a succinylcholine drip. Induction doses: fentanyl 0.05-0.1 mg and thiopental 3-5 mg/kg bodyweight (Th-group) or diazepam 10-20 mg and ketamine 1 mg/kg bodyweight (K-group). Infusion doses: Thiopental 11.7 mg/min. (Th-group) or diazepam 0.2 mg/min. and ketamine 2 mg/min (K-group). Anaesthesia lasted for 20-30 min. We observed and noted during recovery: Breathing, cough-frequency and -quality, alertness, reaction to speech and stimulation, orientation, motor behaviour and well-being. Anaesthesia was sufficient in both groups. The patients of the K-group woke up earlier and their laryngeal reflexes seemed to stabilize quicker than in the Th-group. Because of the elevation of blood pressure caused by the stimulation of the laryngoscopy both methods are not recommended for patients at risk from high blood pressure.", 
    "39": "The influence of clonazepam on thalamo-cortical phenomena was studied in acute experiments in 20 rats. Early components of cortical responses to electrical stimulation of either LA or VDM thalamic nuclei remained unchanged. Only the latency of the late N2 component was significantly shortened after CZP. CZP did not change the incidence of rhythmic after-discharge (\"thalamo-cortical spindles\") and tended to prolong them. Two types of self-sustained after-discharges of an epileptic nature which could appear after the end of rhythmic thalamic stimulation were influenced differently: Spike-and-wave type was invariably suppressed, serrated wave type of SSAD was generally unchanged by CZP. This last finding speaks in favour of the hypothesis that these two types of SSADs could serve as models of two different epileptic seizures.", 
    "40": "Experiments employing a rodent circling model were conducted to test the predictive capacity of the theory which states that striatonigral gamma-aminobutyrate neurones transmit striatal information influencing the animal's locomotion and orientation. In agreement with this proposal, blocking nerve conduction in one substantia nigra with procaine, or nigral gamma-aminobutyrate receptors with bicuculline administered stereotaxically, frequently forced rats to move ipsiversively to systemic apomorphine, as though the treatment had impaired striatonigral transmission on that side of the brain. Attempts to reverse the direction of apomorphine circling by stimulating gamma-aminobutyrate receptors with muscimol, by facilitating the amino acid's action with flurazepam, or by increasing its synaptic concentration either with a breakdown inhibitor (ethanolamine O-sulphate or 4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid) or an uptake blocker (cis-1,3-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) in one nigra, proved unsuccessful. In fact, ethanolamine O-sulphate, flurazepam and muscimol all gave the appearance of hindering rather than enhancing the passage of striatal-derived motor information through the nigra. Broadly speaking, these drugs gave predictable behavioral responses from the ventromedial thalamus, suggesting they were acting in accordance with known mechanisms. The anomalous behaviour with ethanolamine O-sulphate may be attributed to its elevating gamma-aminobutyrate levels in other brain areas, since similar ipsiversive rotations occurred if gamma-aminobutyrate catabolism was prevented at a wide variety of extranigral sites. A simple explanation for the paradoxical ipsiversive behaviours produced by intranigral flurazepam or muscimol in combination with systemic or intracerebral injection of dopamine agonists, is that they act via presynaptic receptors to inhibit the release of endogenous gamma-aminobutyrate and thereby impede striatonigral outflow ipsilaterally.", 
    "41": "Some circulatory parameters were examined, using tetrapolar chest rheography and rheoencephalography, in patients with essential hypertension of stages I-II during emotional stress after oral administration of 5 mg seduxen. Seduxen was not shown to prevent hypertensive response to emotional stress. In the post-stress recovery period, this drug reduces the duration of hypertension. Seduxen is conducive to redirecting the trends of hemodynamic response of hypertensive patients so that it becomes similar to that of normal subjects. In patients with hypokinetic response to emotional stress, seduxen restores the autoregulation capacity of cerebral vessels.", 
    "42": "Sedative-hypnotic antiepileptic drugs have potentially toxic effects, but their removal is often thought to be difficult and dangerous. We completely withdrew all barbiturates and benzodiazepines from 78 patients with intractable epilepsy (48 inpatients and 30 outpatients). Initially, 19 patients had plasma levels of sedative drugs above the therapeutic range; 28 were taking more than one of these drugs. Dosages of nonsedative antiepileptic drugs were adjusted to provide optimal seizure control. After 6 months of outpatient follow-up, 69 patients remained on a nonsedative regimen: 35 (51%) showed improvement in both drug toxicity and seizure control, 13 (19%) in toxicity alone, 8 (12%) in seizure control alone; 12 (16%) were unchanged, and 1 was worse. Of 9 patients restarted on sedative antiepileptic drugs by their private physicians, 4 had more toxic symptoms than at discharge, 1 had more frequent seizures, 3 were unchanged, and 1, who had had a temporal lobectomy after drug withdrawal, had less frequent seizures. Sedative drugs are not necessary for optimal seizure control, even in intractable epilepsy, and they may be safely withdrawn.", 
    "43": "Factors affecting the loss of diazepam from i.v. admixtures to flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and to various administration sets were studied. Admixtures containing diazepam and 0.9% sodium chloride injection were stored for up to 550 hours in flexible PVC bags and in glass vials at various temperatures. Diazepam injection containing two different solvents was used. Initial diazepam concentrations in storage studies ranged from 25 to 100 micrograms/ml and pH ranged from 4.2 to 7.5. To determine availability of diazepam after infusion through administration sets, solutions (50 micrograms/ml) from glass containers were run through six different sets at 1 ml/min for seven hours. In storage studies, the difference in composition of the solvent was found to have only a slight effect on the rate and extent of diazepam loss. Diazepam loss was unaffected by pH. For admixtures stored in 1000-ml flexible PVC bags, the fractional loss of diazepam was greater at small volumes. The diazepam concentration of solutions in flexible PVC bags decreased more rapidly during infusion than during storage of the total original volume. The fraction of diazepam remaining in stored solutions was independent of the initial concentration, but the rate and extent of diazepam loss was greater at higher temperatures. Diazepam loss was dependent on length of flexible PVC tubing, and diazepam availability was greater with faster flow rates. In solutions infused through the polyolefin Tridilset, 100% of the diazepam remained. When storage of diazepam admixtures in PVC bags or administration through PVC tubing cannot be avoided, measures to minimize the rate and extent of diazepam loss include decreasing the temperature and the storage time and increasing the surface-area-to-volume ratio and the flow rate. Equations are presented for calculating the amount of diazepam delivered.", 
    "44": "Diazepam dose preference was studied in 10 human subjects in a hospital setting. Subjects were allowed to select between a standard compound (diazepam or pentobarbital) and one of several doses of diazepam (2-40 mg/capsule) on an ad lib basis. When 5 or 10 mg/capsule diazepam was the standard, no clear cut diazepam dose preference was found. When 30 or 50 mg/capsule pentobarbital was the standard, clear cut diazepam dose preference in some subjects was found. The shape of the dose preference function differed among subjects. Within subjects, diazepam dose preference differed within the self-administration day, with some subjects preferring one dose in the morning and a different dose later in the day.", 
    "45": "A sub-population of beagles with abnormal behavioral patterns has been identified, isolated and tested for responsively to selected classes of psychoactive drugs. The abnormal behavior was ameliorated by anxiolytics and antidepressants but not by antipsychotics, an antihistaminic, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, a beta-adrenergic blocker, or an anticholinergic drug. Improvement occurred after a single dose of the anxiolytic drugs but did not occur until 10-18 days after daily dosing with standard tricylic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitor isocarboxazid. This delayed onset in beagles resembles that seen on use of these drugs in humans. The results with these drugs suggest that the abnormal behaviors of the beagles are related to anxiety and are in part depressive in nature. This colony provides an animal model of abnormal behavior which allows evaluation of the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of drugs and estimates of the onset of action of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "46": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP-0, 5, 10 mg/kg) on feeding, rearing, and ambulatory locomotion of male Holtzman rats were investigated in an open-field arena under 3 different conditions of food deprivation (0, 24, 48 hr). Both CDP and food deprivation enhanced feeding, with their combined effects being essentially additive. Also, CDP significantly decreased both rearing and ambulatory locomotion, although this effect tended to be counteracted by increases in food deprivation. The interrelationship (correlation) of the behavioral effects of CDP suggested that the reduction in activity measures is due, in part, to the competing or incompatible nature of feeding and that rearing and ambulatory locomotion are somewhat redundant measures of activity under the present conditions.", 
    "47": "This study reports on tolerance and cross-tolerance to the rotarod (RR)-disrupting effects of various central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Female rats trained on the RR were fed ground chow containing pentobarbital (PB, 2.0 mg/g chow) or methaqualone (MQ, 1.0 mg/g chow) and were injected twice daily (PB) or daily MQ) with 30 mg/kg IP for 6 days. Control rats received ground chow and saline injections. On day 7 the subjects were tested with various doses of PB, MQ, diazepam (DZ), or ethanol (ET) for disruption of RR performance over the time-course of the drug effect (up to 12 hours). Control animals demonstrated a dose-dependent duration of impairment for all 4 agents. Both groups receiving chronic drug showed a prominent decrease in duration of RR impairment after PB, a less marked decrease after MQ, and even less of a decrease after DZ. However, neither chronic drug group showed an appreciable tolerance to the RR disruption of ET, relative to the control group. Based on the time of 50% recovery (RR performance recovering to 90 seconds or more), both chronic treatments resulted in a significant shift of the dose-response curves for PB, MQ and DZ to the right. Therefore, the degree of tolerance and cross-tolerance in rats chronically treated with PB or MQ was dramatic for PB and MQ, was significant for DZ, but was not demonstrable for ET.", 
    "48": "The total syntheses of naturally occurring E-tomaymycin (1E) and its olefinic geometrical isomer, Z-tomaymycin (1Z) are described. The Z-isomer was found to have the same anti-bacterial activity as E-isomer (1E).", 
    "49": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study was carried out in which the effects of midazolam (0.08 mg.kg-1) and hydroxyzine (1.5 mg.kg-1), with or without atropine (0.4 mg) or hyoscine (0.4 mg) were compared as intramuscular premedicants. Midazolam produced quicker onset of action, greater anxiolysis for the first hour, greater amnesia, less local irritation and a higher overall rating by the patients. Drowsiness, while also greater after midazolam, was neither marked nor prolonged. Both drugs were given similar overall ratings by the anaesthetists who administered the anaesthetics. Neither drug produced systemic toxicity. Of the two drugs known to produce amnesia, midazolam had a more profound effect and had an earlier onset than hyoscine. Midazolam (0.08 mg.kg-1) shows good potential as an intramuscular premedicant, especially when anaesthetic induction occurs 30 to 60 minutes later. Hyoscine, but not atropine, enhances the effects of the sedative drugs.", 
    "50": "Oxazepam and diazepam were compared in healthy elderly volunteers. Absorption of diazepam was faster than oxazepam and onset of clinical effects were more profound. Diazepam accumulation was extensive, washout was slow and active compounds were present two weeks after the last dose. Oxazepam accumulation was significantly less and elimination significantly faster than diazepam. There was no difference between oxazepam and diazepam in sedation or fatigue during the drug treatment, but sedative effects persisted for two weeks after diazepam therapy was discontinued. Sedation rapidly returned to baseline in the oxazepam group. Thus, the differing pharmacokinetic profiles of diazepam and oxazepam have clinical consequences during multiple dosage in the elderly.", 
    "51": "Fourteen healthy volunteers received a single i.v. dose of antipyrine (1.2 g) on two occasions, once before and once during cimetidine treatment (300 mg every 6 hr). In a similar manner, 8 subjects received diazepam (10 mg), 11 subjects received acetaminophen (650 mg) and 8 subjects received lorazepam (2 mg), all by the i.v. route, once before and once during cimetidine coadministration. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated increased antipyrine elimination T1/2 during cimetidine treatment (16.7 vs. 10.9 hr; P less than .001) on the basis of decreased total metabolic clearance (0.46 vs. 0.72 ml/min/kg; P less than .001). Likewise, diazepam T1/2 was increased (58 vs. 39 hr; P less than .01) during cimetidine treatment due to decreased total metabolic clearance (0.42 vs. 0.30 ml/min/kg; P less than .01). In contrast, cimetidine did not alter T1/2 or the clearance of lorazepam (T1/2, 16.8 vs. 15.3 hr; clearance, 1.03 vs 1.07 ml/min/kg) or acetaminophen (T1/2, 2.66 vs. 2.60 hr; clearance, 4.8 vs. 4.5 ml/min/kg), both drugs which undergo conjugative biotransformation. In an animal model used to assess the effect of cimetidine on acetaminophen toxicity, the LD50 of acetaminophen alone in Charles River CD-1 mice was 480 mg/kg (95% confidence interval: 436-528 mg/kg). With simultaneous 75 mg/kg of cimetidine treatment, the LD50 for acetaminophen was significantly increased (P less than .05) to 1020 mg/kg (95% confidence interval: 962-1081 mg/kg). Thus, cimetidine slows the metabolic clearance of antipyrine and diazepam, drugs biotransformed by hepatic oxidation, but does not alter the kinetics of acetaminophen or lorazepam, both metabolized by conjugation. Cimetidine may decrease the toxicity of high-dose acetaminophen by preventing formation of the hepatotoxic oxidative metabolites, although having no effect on conjugation of acetaminophen which yields nontoxic metabolites that are subsequently cleared from the body.", 
    "52": "Status epilepticus is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. General treatment is aimed at restoring physiologic homeostasis, and drug therapy is aimed at arresting the convulsive activity and preventing its recurrence. Concurrent administration of diazepam and either phenytoin or phenobarbital will be effective in most cases. After the status epilepticus has been treated the underlying cause should be investigated and, if possible, treated.", 
    "53": "Genetically-determined stereotypic behavioral convulsions (GDSC) resulting from the autosomal recessive mutation tottering (tg) were studied in C57BL/6J mice. GDSC was found to be reliably induced in (tg/tg) homozygotes with 30 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a dose that is significantly below the threshold for induction of generalized clonic convulsions in (tg/+) heterozygotes and (+/+) wild type C57BL/6J mice. The effects of anticonvulsant drugs on GDSC were studied in (tg/tg) mice induced by 30 mg/kg PTZ. Ethosuximide (250 mg/kg), phenytoin (25 and 50 mg/kg), sodium phenobarbital (25 and 50 mg/kg), naloxone (6 mg/kg), valproic acid (150 mg/kg), sodium valproate (200 mg/kg) and aminooxyacetic acid (25 mg/kg) were all without effect on PTZ induced GDSC. In contrast to its usual anticonvulsant action, phenytoin caused GDSC in (tg/tg) mice. Diazepam (4 mg/kg) was completely effective in blocking GDSC 2 hr post administration. Ethosuximide (250 mg/kg), which did not protect (tg/tg) mice against GDSC, was able to protect both (tg/tg) and (tg/+) mice against generalized clonic-tonic convulsions induced by 85 mg/kg PTZ. These results suggest a novel mechanism of action for the induction of GDSC by 30 mg/kg PTZ in (tg/tg) mice which may involve benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "54": "The facile synthesis of [1,2,3]triazolo((4,5-d][2]benzazepines and dibenzo[c,f][1,2,3]triazolo[3,4-a]azepines by the addition of sodium azide to acetylenic benzophenones is described. Examination of the pharmacological data indicates that selected triazolobenzazepines are as potent as diazepam in the anti-pentylenetetrazole test and are weaker in the inclined screen and rotarod tests, suggesting that these compounds have antianxiety properties similar to diazepam with fewer deficits in motor coordination. In addition, a possible diazepam antagonist was found in the triazolo-benzazepine series. The dibenzotriazoloazepines were found to be inactive in four standard CNS screening procedures.", 
    "55": "Chlordiazepoxide (5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg but not 2.5 mg/kg) administered on 10 successive sessions, significantly impaired the reinforcement-cued discrimination performance of male Sprague-Dawley rats. On three postdrug (saline) recovery sessions, groups previously treated with the drug demonstrated good recovery in discrimination performance. An analysis of response components indicated that the discrimination impairment was due to less inhibition of responding during \"no-go\" phases of the task by the drugged than control animals. While changes in responding during reinforcement phases may also contribute to the performance of drugged animals, no clear pattern emerges from the present study.", 
    "56": "It was examined whether the anticonvulsant activity of valproic acid (di-n-propylacetic acid, DPA) was exerted via the inhibitory GABA system in the central nervous systems (CNS). Dorsal root reflexes (DR-DRR) were not augmented but intensely suppressed following the administration of DPA (50 and 200 mg/kg, i.v.). DPA did not depolarize the resting dorsal root potentials. These electrophysiological findings may indicate that DPA does not potentiate GABA system in the spinal cord of rats. DPA (1 and 10 mM) neither affected the binding of 2 or 40 nM of [3H]muscimol nor the binding of [3H]diazepam in the rat brain membranes; the same concentrations of DPA did not affect the enhancement of binding of [3H]diazepam induced by the addition of GABA (100 microM). The result obtained from binding assays indicates that DPA does not interact with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The findings in the present study do not support the proposal that the anticonvulsant action of DPA is exerted by potentiation of the GABA system in the CNS.", 
    "57": "The head-turning behavior in electrical stimulation of right and left caudate nuclei was tested in chronic experiment in cats. Local head-turning in contra-or ipsilateral direction was found in stimulation of the right caudate nucleus while in the left caudate stimulation generalized locomotor reactions such as controlateral circling, were a more frequent feature. Drugs exerted different effects on reactions of the right and left caudate nuclei to electrical stimulation. L-DOPA and haloperidol increased the intercaudate asymmetry whereas apomorphin and clozapine revealed no such effect. The neurophysiological mechanisms of intercaudate asymmetry and its contribution in pathogenesis of extrapyramidal disorders, are discussed.", 
    "58": "The olfactory cortex slice from the guinea pig has been used to test the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788. Bath application of muscimol has a GABA-mimetic effect on the resting input conductance of these neurones. Benzodiazepines increase the potency of muscimol and increase the duration of postsynaptic inhibitory conductance. To measure the effect of muscimol, the input conductance was measured either directly using intracellular microelectrodes or by measuring its effect on the amplitude of the evoked compound potentials recorded from the slice surface after stimulating the lateral olfactory tract. The potentiation of postsynaptic inhibition produced by benzodiazepines was measured indirectly by their effect on the amplitude of the second of two evoked compound potentials. All of the potentiating effects of diazepam, clonazepam, flurazepam and chlordiazepoxide were blocked by Ro 15-1788 (0.01-10 mumol/l). Ro 15-1788 up to a concentration of 10 mumol/l had no effect on any of the synaptic or electrical responses when applied alone. General anaesthetics which also potentiate inhibition were unaffected by Ro 15-1788. It is concluded that Ro 15-1788 is a highly potent and specific benzodiazepine antagonist in this preparation.", 
    "59": "The onset and duration of action of benzodiazepines after single oral doses depend largely on absorption rate and the rate and extent of distribution. The rate and extent of accumulation during multiple dosage depend on elimination half-life and clearance. A framework is proposed for classification of benzodiazepines according to elimination half-life. Long acting benzodiazepines have half-life values usually exceeding 24 h. Drugs in this category have long-acting pharmacologically active metabolites, often desmethyldiazepam, accumulate extensively during multiple dosage, and may have impaired clearance in the elderly and those with liver disease. Intermediate and short-acting benzodiazepines have half-life values from 5-24 h and active metabolites are uncommon. Accumulation during multiple dosage is less extensive than with the long-acting group and diminishes as the half-life becomes shorter. Age and liver disease have a small influence on metabolic clearance. The half-life of ultrashort-acting benzodiazepines is less than 5 h. These drugs are essentially nonaccumulating. Pharmacokinetic classification may assist in understanding differences among benzodiazepines, but does not explain all of their clinical actions.", 
    "60": "The possible involvement of myosin in elevation of neural folds in the chick was studied. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed the presence of myosin in the neuroepithelium as early as the neural-plate stage and was concentrated in the apical regions of neuroepithelial cells where microfilaments are known to be organized into discrete bundles. This fluorescent pattern persisted until closure of the neural tube. Actin-specific fluorescence followed a similar distribution pattern as myosin. Diazepam (Valium/Roche), at 400 micrograms/ml, was found to preferentially inhibit elevation of neural folds in explanted stage 8 embryos within 6 hr of incubation. Affected neuroepithelial cells were often less elongated, contained thinner and less conspicuous microfilament bundles, and had apical surfaces which were smoother and broader than the controls. These morphological changes were accompanied by a considerable reduction in the intensity of myosin-specific fluorescence, particularly in the cell apices. Results suggest that (1) diazepam inhibits elevation of neural folds through its disruptive effects on the organization and contractility of apical microfilament bundles in developing neuroepithelial cells and (2) myosin may be directly involved in elevation of neural folds.", 
    "61": "Research on the benzodiazepines has shown that they have certain advantages over the opiates as premedicants. Diazepam, which produces good tranquilization, is well absorbed when given orally though absorption is influenced by other drugs given at the same time. Oral lorazepam leads to more prolonged sedation and amnesia but the final elimination is more rapid. Several new intravenous anaesthetics have been introduced during the last five years but none seems likely to replace thiopental. The theoretical disadvantages of thiopental are offset by its water-solubility, and the use of Cremophor EL in preparations of propanidid, alphaxalone, di-isopropyl phenol and one preparation of diazepam has led to many hypersensitivity reactions. Ketamine is gradually finding its rightful place in anaesthesia but its use is becoming limited to anaesthesia in difficult circumstances. The future concomitant use of other drugs and separation of isomers of ketamine may again broaden its applications. The new water-soluble steroid minaxolone has its own disadvantages, and the water-soluble benzodiazepine midazolam is as unpredictable for induction of anaesthesia as diazepam.", 
    "62": "This double-blind study of the effects of diazepam on painful cervical muscle spasms compared with those of phenobarbital and an inert placebo employed clinical, electrogoniometric and electromyographic recording methods for evaluation and computer analysis. The clinical results were equivocal but the technological recordings revealed a statistically significant greater desirable effect of diazepam compared to the other 2 treatments which would be expected to have only minor nonspecific effects.", 
    "63": "The relationship between treating physician's prognosis and treatment response to active drug or placebo in samples of 517 anxious and 569 depressed outpatients who had participated in 4-week double-blind drug trials was examined. Log-linear analyses employing diagnosis, prognosis, treatment (active drug or placebo), and treatment response were conducted. Anxious patients had been treated with either chlordiazepoxide or placebo, and depressed patients had received either amitriptyline or placebo. Significant differences were found, suggesting that physician prognosis is related to pharmacologically induced symptom relief in anxious but not in depressed patients. In the depressed patient sample, prognosis and improvement were found to be significantly related in placebo but not drug-treated patients.", 
    "64": "The problem of benzodiazepine receptor localization in the rat hippocampal formation has been approached using several methods of selective deafferentation, followed by [3H]flunitrazepam binding studies. The intraventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine reduced, after 14 days, the norepinephrine content of the hippocampal formation by 68.4%, and decreased the number of binding sites by 32%, without change in affinity. The intraventricular injection of 5,6 dihydroxytryptamine reduced the serotonin content by 61.5% but did not alter the [3H]flunitrazepam binding. The intraventricular bilateral injection of 0.5 micrograms kainic acid selectively destroyed the pyramidal neurons in area CA3 of both hippocampi and produced an increase of 28% in [3H]flunitrazepam binding, without change in affinity. These results are discussed in relation to our previous observations about benzodiazepine receptor changes after fimbria-fornix transection. The reduction in [3H]flunitrazepam binding after administration of 6-hydroxydopamine suggests the possible localization of the benzodiazepine receptors on adrenergic presynaptic terminals. The increase in binding sites after destruction of CA3 pyramidal cells, which are the site of origin of commissural fibers, is tentatively interpreted as resulting from the sprouting of mossy fibers that replace the associational-commissural projections.", 
    "65": "Diazepam and meprobamate significantly attenuated the increases in grooming behavior induced by peptides. Significant increases in total grooming frequency over a thirty minute observation period were produced by intraventricular administration of 1 microgram ACTH1-24 and by 1 microgram bombesin to awake rats. Diazepam 1 mg/kg IP blocked the peptide-induced increases in grooming. Non-sedating doses of diazepam also completely reversed the grooming seen when rats were placed in a novel environment. The functional antagonism between anxiolytics and stress-related peptides supports the concept of interacting brain mechanisms mediating stress and anxiety."
