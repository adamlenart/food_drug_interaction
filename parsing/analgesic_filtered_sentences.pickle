aS'12132774 | d-arabinose | Based upon the hydrolysis of arbutin and aesculin and the fermentation of salicin and D-arabinose, four distinct biotypes could be recognised among the 73 H. alvei isolates tested; biotype 1 (D-(-)-arabinose-positive only) accounted for 75% of all isolates analysed.'
p97
aS'16988054 | harmol | In the present study, the involvement in this process of Mrp3 and Mrp4, two basolateral efflux transporters, was evaluated by analyzing the hepatic basolateral excretion of the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of acetaminophen, 4-methylumbelliferone, and harmol in Abcc3(-/-) and Abcc4(-/-) mice using a cassette dosing approach.'

aS'24990389 | manoyl oxide | MvELS is active in vitro and in vivo with three different prenyl diphosphate substrates forming the marrubiin precursor 9,13-epoxy-labd-14-ene, as identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, manoyl oxide and miltiradiene.'
p99
aS'8904818 | veranisatin a | Veranisatin A and the related compound, anisatin, were tested for the other pharmacological activities such as locomotor activity and analgesic effect.'
p100
aS'8614248 | nonivamide | Other analogs of capsaicin, such as dihydrocapsaicin and nonivamide, also formed similar metabolites via aliphatic hydroxylation.'
p101
aS'9151727 | nonivamide | Because its initial application to skin produces pain, nonpungent analogs such as olvanil and glyceryl nonivamide (GLNVA) were synthesized to enhance its clinical use.'
p102
aS'25455106 | nonivamide | We conclude that nonivamide treatment exerts analgesic action in chronic low back pain and causes the release of the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory neuropeptide somatostatin which may play pivotal role in the pain-relieving effect.'
p103
aS'8904818 | veranisatin c | Veranisatin A and the related compound, anisatin, were tested for the other pharmacological activities such as locomotor activity and analgesic effect.'
p104
aS'8904818 | veranisatin b | Veranisatin A and the related compound, anisatin, were tested for the other pharmacological activities such as locomotor activity and analgesic effect.'
p105
aS'26692456 | swertiajaponin | Polynomial regression analysis showed the association between the contents of swertiajaponin, swertisin, trans-aconitic, and chicoric acids with the antitumor necrosis factor- activity of the extracts and fractions.'
p106
aS'8661934 | benzoyl-coa | This represents another case in which benzoyl-CoA is a central intermediate in anaerobic aromatic metabolism.'
p107
aS'24022687 | 3-dehydroquinate | The correlation analysis of gene expression and active compound contents support the idea that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and phosphomevalonate kinase in the mevalonate pathway and 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase in shikimate biosynthesis are potentially closely related to the accumulation of paeoniflorin and benzoylpaeoniflorin.'
p108
aS'10418340 | ginkgetin | In this study, ginkgetin was evaluated for in vivo antiarthritic and analgesic activities.'
p109
aS'10418340 | ginkgetin | When analgesic activity was measured, ginkgetin showed a dose-dependent inhibition in an animal model of acetic acid-induced writhing.'
p110
aS'10418340 | ginkgetin | All these results indicate that ginkgetin may be a potential antiarthritic agent having analgesic activity.'
p111
aS'11988854 | ginkgetin | Ginkgetin, a biflavone from Ginkgo biloba leaves, was previously reported to be a phospholipase A2 inhibitor and this compound showed the potent antiarthritic activity in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis as well as analgesic activity.'
p112
aS'16327145 | ginkgetin | Ginkgetin, a biflavone from Ginkgo biloba leaves, was previously reported to be a phospholipase A(2) inhibitor and this compound showed the potent antiarthritic activity in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis as well as analgesic activity.'
p113
aS'15368673 | albafuran a | Five new compounds, named guangsangons A (1), B (5), C (6), D (7), and E (8), along with four known compounds, albafuran C (2), kuwanon X (3), kuwanon P (4), and kuwanon Y (9) were isolated from Morus macroura Miq..
