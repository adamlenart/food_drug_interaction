S"This study assessed the effect of manidipine on normal subjects' monocyte gene and protein expression of OxSt-related proteins such as p22(phox), a NAD(P)H oxidase system subunit, critical in generating O2-, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), induced by and protective from OxSt, and compared manidipine with the ACE inhibitor captopril and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, in the presence and absence of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) as an inducer of OxSt.Co-incubation of manidipine with NaAsO2 dose-dependently decreased p22(phox) mRNA production from basal: 0.87 +/- 0.1 d.u., 0.69 +/- 0.06 and 0.66 +/- 0.09 at 100, 300 and 500 nM respectively versus 0.99 +/- 0.2, P < 0.04, while HO-1 mRNA production was increased by the same concentrations of the drug: 0.87 +/- 0.1 d.u., 0.92 +/- 0.1, 0.98 +/- 0.1 respectively versus 0.63 +/- 0.07; P < 0.03."

aVIn addition, ACE inhibitory activity was observed in a boiling water extract of asparagus.
p1455
aVThe ACE inhibitor purified and isolated from asparagus was identified as 2\u2033-hydroxynicotianamine.

aVIn conclusion, 2\u2033-hydroxynicotianamine in asparagus may be one of the factors inhibiting ACE activity in the kidney, thus preventing hypertension and preserving renal function.
