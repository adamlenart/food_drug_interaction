aS"19491701 | potato | We report an unusual case of acute 'familiar' digitalis poisoning in three patients who had eaten potato dumplings flavoured with leaves of Borago officinalis L. unconsciously mixed with leaves of Digitalis purpurea L. A complicated clinical course with marked bradyarrhythmias was presented, with good evolution thanks to the use of digoxin-specific antibody Fab fragments."

aS'9626955 | potato | Five kinds of synthetic oligonucleotide probes labeled with biotin (BIO) were designed for the detection of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), and their sensitivities were compared with that of a digoxigenin (DIG)- or BIO-labeled cDNA probe.'

aS'22593939 | salicylic acid | This systematic literature review revealed that 47 % of all serious MEs were caused by seven drugs or drug classes: methotrexate, warfarin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), digoxin, opioids, acetylic salicylic acid, and beta-blockers; 30 drugs or drug classes caused 82 % of all serious MEs.'
p216
aS'2849595 | salicylic acid | Examples include antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, erythromycin); the cardiac stimulant digoxin from foxglove (Digitalis purpurea); salicylic acid, a precursor of aspirin, derived from willow bark (Salix spp.'

aS'11128247 | salicylic acid | This strategy was applied for the production of biomass and glycosides digitoxin and digoxin in shoot cultures on MS medium supplemented with 7.5 M BA and several treatments with plant growth regulators, incubation period, abiotic (salicylic acid, mannitol, sorbitol, PEG-6000, NaCl, and KCl), biotic (Aspergillus niger, Helminthosporium sp., Alternaria sp., chitin, and yeast extract) elicitors, and precursors (progesterone, cholesterol, and squalene).'
p218
aS'6773155 | salicylic acid | All basic drugs tested (verapamil, dipyridamole, amiodarone, nifedipine, diltiazem, ajmaline, chlorpromazine, imipramine, disopyramide, quinidine, procainamide, propranolol and lidocaine: 50 microM) except for procainamide, propranolol and lidocaine significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the uptake of digoxin, whereas acidic drugs (salicylic acid and phenytoin) had no effect.'
p219
aS'17385805 | n-butanol | After the addition of digoxin as an internal standard (IS), rat plasmas were extracted with n-butanol saturated with pure water and all analytes were separated on a reversed-phased C(18) column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (0.5 mM ammonium chloride) and pumped at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.'
p220
aS'16307859 | n-butanol | After a liquid/liquid extraction (LLE) with n-butanol and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gradient separation with acetonitrile-NH4Cl solution (0.5 micromol/L) as the mobile phase, the anions adduct [M + Cl]- at m/z 819.4 of astragaloside-IV, and [M + Cl]- at m/z 815.35 of internal standard (IS) digoxin were analyzed by electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode.'
