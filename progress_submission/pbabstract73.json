However, direct measurements of their effects on the splanchnic veins, perhaps the most important volume reservoir, have not been reported. We assessed the effect of acute heart failure and the subsequent administration of hydralazine, enalaprilat, and nitroglycerin on the splanchnic venous pressure-volume relation in intact dogs.", 
    "1": "Experimental acute ischemic heart failure was induced in 19 splenectomized dogs by microsphere embolization of the left main coronary artery. Embolization was repeated until left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) reached 20 mm Hg and cardiac output decreased by 50%. The splanchnic vascular pressure-volume relation was determined by radionuclide plethysmography during the control stage, after acute heart failure had been established, and after administration of a vasodilator (hydralazine, enalaprilat, or nitroglycerin) at a dose sufficient to reduce mean aortic pressure by approximately 20%. Induction of acute heart failure was associated with a decrease in the splanchnic vascular volume from 100% to 86 +/- 2% and an increase in LVEDP from 6 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 mm Hg (P < .001). There was a parallel leftward shift of the splanchnic vascular pressure-volume curve. After the administration of hydralazine, enalaprilat, and nitroglycerin, the splanchnic vascular volumes increased from 86% to 88 +/- 3%, 96 +/- 3%, and 113 +/- 3%, respectively (P = NS, P < .01, and P < .001, respectively, versus heart failure). After drug administration, the LVEDPs were 18 +/- 2, 16 +/- 1, and 13 +/- 1 mm Hg (P = NS, P < .05, and P < .001, respectively, versus heart failure).", 
    "2": "Acute heart failure was associated with a parallel leftward shift of the splanchnic venous pressure-volume relation (venoconstriction). Splanchnic (systemic) venoconstriction may in part explain the increased LVEDP during acute heart failure by displacement of blood to the central compartment. Subsequently administered enalaprilat and, to a greater degree, nitroglycerin produced splanchnic venodilation, thereby lowering LVEDP. Hydralazine had no significant effect on the splanchnic veins and only a modest effect on LVEDP. In this model, splanchnic capacitance changes appear to modulate change in left ventricular preload.", 
    "3": "Previous attempts in animals failed to reproduce the metabolic, pathological, and clinical situations encountered in homocystinuric patients. Minipigs on a methionine-rich caseinate-based diet, however, have a special long-lasting postprandial plasma accumulation of methionine, the metabolic precursor of homocysteine. We hypothesized that these minipigs develop hyperhomocysteinemia in the long term. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition prevents atherogenic alteration of viscoelastic functions of arterial pulsatility and compliance and reduces fragmentation of vascular elastic laminae in the minipigs. We consequently analyzed the therapeutic effects of the captopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination against the typical hyperhomocysteinemia-induced alterations of vascular elastic features.", 
    "4": "Thirty-two G\u00f6tingen minipigs were randomized as control diet-fed (C), captopril (25 mg/d)/hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/d)-treated C (C+Cp), caseinate-based diet-fed (M), and M+Cp minipigs. After 4 months, M and M+Cp animals had hyperhomocysteinemia (9.64 +/- 4.10 mumol/L, n = 16) compared with C and C+Cp minipigs (5.67 +/- 1.14 mumol/L, n = 16) (P < .05). In the M group, one minipig died from thromboembolic syndrome, and one had pulmonary infarction. M minipigs presented with systolic-diastolic hypertension and extended reactive hyperemia, as well as a mega-artery syndrome in hyperpulsatile arteries due to expanded volumetric compliance, curtailed stiffness, strengthened vascular tension, and prevalence of the viscous wall component. In their arterial tree, hypertrophic endothelial cells covered a thickened subendothelial space. Major elastic lamina dislocations were observed, as well as hypertrophy and reorientation of smooth muscle cells, resulting in the settlement of spreading pathways for medial cells between muscular laminae. In C+Cp and M+Cp animals, serum and lung ACE activity were inhibited by 74% and 40%, respectively. Although the treatment with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide did not modify the hyperhomocysteinemia per se, the therapeutic effects of the drug combination are made evident by the absence of death and ischemic diseases in the M+Cp group. Specifically, the drug combination prevented diastolic hypertension and improved aortic blood flow by normalizing peripheral resistances, abolished the vascular hyperpulsatile characters, and restrained the fragmentation and the splitting of elastic fibers in capacitance arteries. In contrast, the drugs slightly prevented systolic and mean hypertension. In addition, the aortic stiffness and stress response remained altered and vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy was still observed in the M+Cp group.", 
    "5": "In minipigs, the present methionine-rich caseinate-based diet induced hyperhomocysteinemia, which reproduces the metabolic and histopathological situation found in homocysteic patients. Our results show that hyperhomocysteinemia-induced vascular alterations favor the viscous component of the wall rheology to the detriment of the elastic component. Furthermore, they extend to hyperhomocysteinemia the therapeutic effects characteristically shared by ACE inhibitors in association with hydrochlorothiazide against the atherogenic activation of elastinolytic processes.", 
    "6": "A comprehensive evaluation of arterial load characteristics and left ventricular energetics in systemic hypertension has been limited by the need for invasive techniques to access instantaneous aortic pressure and flow. As a consequence of this methodological limitation, no data exist on the effects of long-term antihypertensive therapy on global arterial impedance properties and indexes of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Using recently validated noninvasive techniques, we compared in hypertensive patients the effects of chronic oral treatment with ramipril, nifedipine, and atenolol on arterial impedance and mechanical power dissipation as well as indexes of MVO2.", 
    "7": "Sixteen African-American subjects with systemic hypertension were studied with a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol. Instantaneous central aortic pressure and flow, from which arterial load characteristics can be derived, were estimated from calibrated subclavian pulse tracings (SPTs) and continuous-wave aortic Doppler velocity in conjunction with two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic measurements of the aortic annulus, respectively. To derive ventricular wall stress and indexes of MVO2, left ventricular short- (M-mode) and long-axis (2D echo) images were acquired simultaneously with SPTs. Data were collected at the end of a 2-week washout period (predrug control) and after 6 weeks of treatment with each agent. Although all three agents reduced diastolic blood pressure to the same extent, different effects on mean and systolic pressures and vascular impedance properties were noted. Nifedipine reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR; 1744 +/- 398 versus 1290 +/- 215 dyne-s/cm5) and increased arterial compliance (ACL; 1.234 +/- 0.253 versus 1.776 +/- 0.415 mL/mm Hg). This improvement in arterial compliance was not entirely accounted for by the reduction in distending pressure. Ramipril also decreased TPR (1740 +/- 292 versus 1437 +/- 290 dyne-s/cm5) and increased ACL (1.214 +/- 0.190 versus 1.569 +/- 0.424 mL/mm Hg), but with this agent, the change in arterial compliance was explained solely on the basis of a reduction in distending pressure. Atenolol, in contrast, did not affect either TPR or ACL. In agreement with the compliance results, nifedipine and ramipril significantly lowered the first two harmonics of the impedance spectrum, but atenolol did not. None of these agents resulted in a significant change in characteristic impedance or in the relative amplitude of the reflected pressure wave. Total vascular mechanical power and percent of oscillatory power remained unaltered with all antihypertensive treatments. Only ramipril and nifedipine reduced the integral of both meridional and circumferential systolic wall stresses, indicating that MVO2 per beat was reduced with these agents. Stress-time index, a measure of MVO2 per unit time, decreased significantly with ramipril but not with nifedipine because of an increase in heart rate noted in 10 of 16 patients (mean increase, 10 beats per minute). Thus, a reduction in MVO2 coupled with unchanged total vascular mechanical power suggests improved efficiency of ventriculoarterial coupling with ramipril and with nifedipine in the subset of patients in whom heart rate remained unchanged. In contrast, there was no evidence of a reduction in wall stress, stress integral, or stress-time index with atenolol.", 
    "8": "The noninvasive methodology used in this study constitutes a new tool for serial and simultaneous evaluation of arterial hemodynamics and left ventricular energetics in systemic hypertension. In this study, we demonstrate the differential effects of chronic antihypertensive therapies on systemic arterial circulation and indexes of MVO2 in African-American subjects. Consideration of drug-induced differential responses of arterial load and indexes of MVO2 with each drug may provide a more physiological approach to the treatment of systemic hypertension in indivi", 
    "9": "Plasma endothelin levels are elevated approximately two- to threefold in a number of chronic pathophysiological conditions associated with hypertension. Results from recent studies indicate an important interaction between endothelin and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The role of the RAS in mediating the increases in arterial pressure produced by long-term pathophysiological elevations in circulating levels of endothelin is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to chronically increase circulating levels of endothelin within the pathophysiological range and determine the long-term cardiovascular and renal actions of endothelin in control dogs (n = 6) and in dogs pretreated with a converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI) (n = 6) or CEI + angiotensin II (ANG II) replacement (n = 6). Infusion of endothelin-1 for 8 days at a rate of 2.5 ng.kg-1.min-1 increased plasma endothelin from 7.1 +/- 0.9 to 19.8 +/- 3.3 pg/ml. In control dogs, endothelin increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 19% (90 +/- 2 to 107 +/- 3 mmHg) while decreasing renal blood flow (RBF) by 30% and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 15-20%. Long-term elevation of circulating endothelin produced similar elevations in MAP in dogs pretreated with CEI (+16%) or CEI + ANG II (+17%). Similar decreases in RBF and GFR also occurred in response to endothelin in all three groups. These results indicate that although long-term increases in circulating endothelin within the pathophysiological range produce significant increases in arterial pressure, this effect does not appear to be mediated by the RAS.", 
    "10": "The effect of dietary protein on renal function and on renal microvascular reactivity to angiotensin II was determined in rats fed a high-protein diet (40% protein), a low-protein diet (6% protein), or a normal diet (23% protein). Inulin clearance was higher in high-protein-fed rats (n = 7) than in rats fed a low-protein diet (n = 7), 0.88 +/- 0.14 (means +/- SE) vs. 0.54 +/- 0.07 ml.min-1.g kidney wt-1 (P < 0.05). We also used videomicroscopy to assess the effect of angiotensin II on the renal microcirculation in a hydronephrotic kidney preparation. The afferent and efferent arterioles constricted to angiotensin II and norepinephrine in both high- and low-protein-fed rats; this constriction was diminished to angiotensin II but not to norepinephrine, in rats fed a high-protein diet (-24.3 +/- 4.5, -20.2 +/- 4.2%) compared with rats fed a low-protein diet (-39 +/- 5.1, -39.1 +/- 5.7%). The vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II in rats fed a high-protein diet and a normal diet were significantly greater following inhibition of angiotensin II formation with captopril but not in low-protein-fed rats. The apparent high-endogenous level of angiotensin II among rats fed a high-protein diet may account for the diminished reactivity to exogenous angiotensin II. Thus alterations in intrinsic vascular reactivity to angiotensin II are not responsible for the altered hemodynamics associated with dietary protein.", 
    "11": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) dramatically worsens hypertensive illness. Because the genesis of LVH appears to be multifactorial, antihypertensive treatment should aim to reduce not only pressor values but also the hypertrophic ventricular mass. This result can be obtained only when drugs able to act on both pathogenetic factors are used. To evaluate the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy on regression of LVH, 21 patients with stage 2 essential hypertension were treated for a year with either atenolol (120 mg/d orally), a cardioselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or ramipril (5 mg/d orally), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue activity. Both treatments produced significant control of hypertension and regression of LVH. No statistically significant difference between treatments was noted, except for heart rate, which was substantially unchanged by ramipril but significantly decreased by atenolol. Both drugs were well tolerated. Atenolol and ramipril have a major role in the long-term treatment of hypertension and in the regression of hypertension-associated LVH.", 
    "12": "Captopril (Tenziomin) treated rats after subtotal (5/6) nephrectomy showed conspicuously better function of kidney tissue remnants than untreated animals. Histology was the same in both groups--focal glomerulosclerosis, anisocytosis and anisokaryosis of tubular epithelial cells, hyperplasia of proximal tubuli. Proteinuria was substantially lower in treated animals. Lectin histochemistry showed differences between superficial and juxtamedullary nephrons in glycoprotein contents and function. An important finding was selective binding of WGA lectin in brush border of proximal convoluted tubuli of juxtamedullary nephrons. Differences in lectin binding between nephrectomized and intact control animals were rather quantitative than qualitative.", 
    "13": "In nine normal subjects, specific airway conductance was measured by whole body plethysmography before and immediately after hypocapnic hyperventilation. This procedure, forced expiratory manoeuvres and arterial blood pressure measurements were carried out before and 4 h after placebo and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, in a double-blind, randomized study design. Bronchoconstriction to hypocapnic hyperventilation was shown by a reduction in specific airway conductance on all occasions (P < 0.001). A reduction in mean blood pressure was obtained after enalapril compared to placebo (P < 0.05). No significant change attributable to enalapril was observed in any lung function measurement either at rest or immediately after hypocapnic hyperventilation, despite an expected enhancement of endogenous angiotensin converting enzyme activity by alkalosis. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme revealed no effect of the endogenous activity of this enzyme on airway calibre either at rest or during the bronchoconstrictor response to hypocapnic hyperventilation.",

    "19": "This study tested whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril can modify the glucose transport system in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle. Obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats (approximately 300 g)--a model of insulin resistance--were administered by gavage either a single dose (50 mg/kg body weight) or repeated doses (50 mg/kg/d for 14 consecutive days) of captopril. Corresponding groups of age-matched, vehicle-treated lean (Fa/-) littermates (approximately 170 g) were also studied. Glucose transport activity in the epitrochlearis muscle was assessed by in vitro 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake. The increase in 2-DG uptake due to insulin (2 mU/mL) in muscles from vehicle-treated obese rats was less than 50% (P < .05) of the increase observed in muscles from lean rats. Short-term captopril treatment improved insulin-stimulable 2-DG uptake in muscles from obese rats by 46% (P < .05), and this enhanced insulin action due to captopril was completely abolished by pretreatment with the bradykinin antagonist HOE 140 (100 micrograms/kg). Long-term treatment with captopril produced a 60% improvement in insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake (P < .05). Contraction-stimulated 2-DG uptake was significantly impaired (-31%, P < .05) in the obese rat, but was not altered by long-term captopril treatment. These findings indicate that both short- and long-term treatments with captopril significantly improve insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle of the obese Zucker rat, and that this improvement involves bradykinin metabolism. These data therefore support the hypothesis that captopril-induced improvements in glucose disposal result in part from an enhancement of the skeletal muscle glucose transport system.", 
    "20": "Pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin (ANG) IV, the 3-8 amino acid fragment of ANG II, were compared with responses to ANG I, ANG II, and ANG III and to other vasoactive peptides in the isolated blood perfused rat lung. In terms of relative activity, ANG IV was similar in potency to bradykinin and serotonin but was approximately 100-fold less potent than ANG I, ANG II, and ANG III. PD-123319, an AT2-receptor antagonist, enhanced pressor responses to the four angiotensin peptides and to bradykinin but did not significantly change the pressor response to serotonin or to ventilatory hypoxia. DuP-753, an AT1-receptor antagonist, significantly decreased pressor responses to the four angiotensin peptides and enhanced the pressor responses to bradykinin but not to serotonin. Captopril and enalaprilat increased the pressor response to ANG IV. Meclofenamate and N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester shifted the dose-response curve for ANG IV to the left in a manner similar to that observed with ANG II and ANG III. These data show that ANG IV has significant vasoconstrictor activity and suggest that responses are mediated by the activation of AT1 receptors and that vasopressor responses of the angiotensin peptides may be modulated by activation of AT2 receptors. These results also suggest that responses to ANG IV are modulated by the release of vasodilator prostaglandins and nitric oxide and that AT2 receptors have little, if any, role in mediating or modulating the pressor response to ventilatory hypoxia.", 
    "21": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reduce cardiac mass in both clinical and experimental cardiac hypertrophy. Because cytoplasmic Na+ and pH have been implicated as regulators of cell growth, we examined the effect of treatment with an ACE inhibitor on intracellular Na+ activity (alpha iNa) and pH (pHi) in the heart. After treatment of rabbits with captopril for 8 days alpha iNa was reduced relative to controls (3.6 +/- 0.4, n = 8, vs. 8.2 +/- 0.4 mM, n = 9, P < 0.001), whereas pHi was unchanged. To account for the difference in alpha iNa we measured electrogenic Na(+)-K+ pump activity in single isolated myocytes. Treatment with captopril increased pump currents at near-physiological levels of intracellular Na+ but had no effect at near-saturating levels of Na+. A similar increase in Na(+)-K+ pump activity occurred in rabbits treated with another ACE inhibitor, enalapril, but not with the vasodilator, hydralazine. We speculate that a decrease in alpha iNa after treatment with captopril may contribute to the well-documented ability of ACE inhibitors to reduce cardiac mass.", 
    "22": "Neutral endopeptidase inhibition (NEP-I) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-I) act synergistically to produce acute beneficial hemodynamic effects in models of heart failure. Blockade of the formation of angiotensin II (Ang II) acting together with potentiation of the natriuretic peptides, bradykinin and other vasoactive peptides may mediate the interaction of dual enzyme inhibition. In this study, the potential roles of Ang II repression and bradykinin potentiation were evaluated in conscious cardiomyopathic hamsters with compensated heart failure. The Ang II AT1 receptor antagonist, SR 47436 (BMS-186295), was administered at 30 mumol/kg, i.v. followed by i.v. infusion at 1 mumol/kg/min in combination with NEP-I (SQ-28603 at 30 mumol/kg i.v.). Cardiac preload (left ventricular end diastolic pressure) and afterload (left ventricular systolic pressure) decreased significantly more after the combination of Ang II blockade and NEP-I than after either treatment alone. This indicated that repression of Ang II contributes importantly to the NEP-I/ACE-I interaction. Bradykinin B2 receptor antagonism by Hoe 140 at 100 micrograms/kg, i.v. significantly blunted the decrease in left ventricular end diastolic pressure but not the decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure after dual NEP-I/ACE-I (SQ-28603 and enalaprilat each at 30 mumol/kg, i.v.). This suggests that bradykinin potentiation contributes to the preload-reducing, but not the afterload-reducing, acute effects of NEP-I/ACE-I. Hence, both Ang II repression and bradykinin potentiation are factors contributing to the synergistic hemodynamic effects of combined NEP-I and ACE-I in hamsters with heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "At a time when deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke are markedly declining, mortality from heart failure is increasing. Heart failure is a costly and devastating disease, and throughout much of the industrialized world, escalating health-care costs constitute a serious burden on both public and private systems of financing health care, and about one-third of all heart failure patients are admitted to hospital each year. Both prevalance and incidence of heart failure increase steeply with increasing age. The prevalence rate is about 1% at the age of 50, whilst at the age of 80 and above, almost one out of 10 persons will suffer from heart failure. Until recently, the goals for heart failure treatment were to relieve symptoms and enhance functional capacity. Recently, some large scale studies have shown that ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality, prevent development of heart failure, avoid the need for hospitalization and improve prognosis. ACE inhibitors may therefore have promising effects both on patients and on society. A challenge for the future must be early recognition and timely and adequate treatment of heart failure. Such a strategy might have great economic benefits as far as public health is concerned. However, the most rewarding efforts for the population will be to prevent the underlying causes of coronary heart failure as well as risk factors for heart failure. This review will study the magnitude of heart failure as a growing public health problem, the underlying causes, risk factors and treatment.", 
    "24": "The objective of this study was to assess individual responses to antihypertensive treatment by N-of-1 trials using blood pressure self-monitoring in 79 patients of both sexes referred to a hypertension clinic. Thirty-five patients who remained untreated (study 1) and 44 N-of-1 trial participants (study 2) were consecutively selected if their clinic blood pressure was between 160/95 and 220/115 mm Hg and there were no hypertensive complications. Blood pressure was measured daily at home for 21 days (three consecutive measures, morning and evening). Each N-of-1 trial was a single-blind treatment consisting of two successive 10-day treatment pairs, each pair comprising 5 days of placebo followed by 5 days of 20 mg enalapril once daily in the morning. Study 1 showed no significant blood pressure regression toward the mean over 20 days and justified the choice of 5-day treatment periods in study 2. In study 2, blood pressure fell significantly 12 hours after the first administration of enalapril and rose within 24 hours of the end of the 5-day active treatment period. Using evening blood pressure values (12 hours after enalapril intake) from the first treatment pair, 33 patients were classified as responders (diastolic blood pressure fall > or = mm Hg). In 16 of these 33 patients, the fall in blood pressure above 6 mm Hg was not maintained in the morning, 24 hours after drug intake.

    "25": "Phase II of two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertension in the rat is characterized by elevated blood pressure and near-normal plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) but is reversed by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. We hypothesized that this angiotensin dependence is due to enhanced responsiveness to the slow pressor effect of Ang II caused by renal artery stenosis. To test this idea, we submitted rats to either renal artery clipping or sham operation. These groups were immediately subdivided; some animals received enalapril in their drinking water (508 mumol/L), and the rest drank distilled water only. After 10 to 14 days, catheters were inserted into the aorta and vena cava, and the rats were housed in metabolism cages. After 3 control days of measurement of mean arterial pressure and other variables, the enalapril-treated groups received an intravenous infusion of Ang II at a dose of 3.8 pmol/min (4 ng/min) for 14 days. Rats not drinking enalapril received only saline vehicle (2 mmol Na+ per day). After 3 days of Ang II infusion, the enalapril-treated 2K1C rats had attained a significantly higher level of mean arterial pressure than the enalapril-treated sham rats. At the end of the Ang II infusion, mean arterial pressure in enalapril-treated 2K1C rats was 151 +/- 6 mm Hg versus 107 +/- 7 mm Hg in enalapril-treated sham rats. Mean arterial pressure in the enalapril-treated sham rats after Ang II infusion was not significantly different from that of untreated sham rats (109 +/- 2 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Left ventricular hypertrophy in response to pressure overload may be modified by neurohumoral activation. To investigate the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system, we studied rats after banding of the ascending aorta that developed severe left ventricular hypertrophy associated with normal plasma renin but elevated cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels. Rats were treated with vehicle, ACE inhibitor (ramipril), angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (losartan), or vasodilator (hydralazine) during weeks 7 through 12 after aortic banding. A significant regression of left ventricular mass index as determined by serial echocardiography was observed in ramipril- and losartan-treated groups during weeks 9 through 12 after banding, whereas hypertrophy further increased in vehicle- and hydralazine-treated groups. Twelve weeks after banding, relative left ventricular weights and myocyte widths were markedly increased in vehicle- and hydralazine-treated groups, whereas ramipril and losartan significantly reduced these parameters. In addition, molecular adaptations in left ventricular hypertrophy, such as upregulation of left ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide and downregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA levels, were blunted by ramipril or losartan treatment. Hypertrophic regression was associated with reduced mortality in rats treated with ramipril (11%) and losartan (13%) versus hydralazine (20%) and vehicle (31%). Thus, the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the maintenance of chronic left ventricular hypertrophy. Blockade of the system may result in regression of the hypertrophic phenotype and improve survival in rats despite persistent pressure overload.",

We undertook this study to determine whether the rat mesenteric artery produces aldosterone and to investigate the effects of adrenalectomy, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, Ang II, or potassium on aldosterone production in vascular tissue. Isolated rat mesenteric arteries were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution for 4 hours. The perfusate was collected and chromatographed in a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) system. The fraction corresponding to synthetic aldosterone was collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The aldosterone concentration in the perfusate from the adrenalectomized rats and rats treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was measured using radioimmunoassay after HPLC separation. The mass spectra of synthetic aldosterone and aldosterone isolated from the perfusate of rat mesenteric arteries were identical. Aldosterone production in the mesenteric arteries of adrenalectomized rats was increased and of rats treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was reduced compared with that of controls. Ang II (1.9 x 10(10) mol/L) and potassium (6.0 mmol/L) increased aldosterone production in mesenteric arteries. This study shows that the rat mesenteric artery produces aldosterone and that the intravascular renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may contribute to vascular tone.",

Systolic blood pressure and body weight were measured each week from 6 to 20 weeks of age. During treatment, Hoe 140 treatment resulted in lower blood pressures than in controls. Rampiril caused a larger fall in blood pressure over the same period. The ramipril plus Hoe 140 group had the lowest blood pressures of any group during treatment. After treatment, the blood pressure of Hoe 140-treated SHR was similar to that of untreated SHR. After ramipril, blood pressure rose but plateaued significantly below values in controls. In contrast, withdrawal of combined ramipril and Hoe 140 treatment caused a rapid rise of systolic blood pressure to levels significantly higher than in ramipril-treated SHR but less than in controls. The antihypertensive effects of Hoe 140 during the development of genetic hypertension may represent a direct effect of the drug or some alteration in the normal relation between bradykinin and blood pressure. The antagonism by Hoe 140 of the long-term blood pressure reduction after ramipril withdrawal indicates that the persistent effects of ACE inhibitors may in part be due to the accumulation of bradykinin during a critical stage of development.",

As assessed by an intention-to-treat analysis, the mean difference in minimal coronary lumen diameter (mean +/- 1 SD) between the postangioplasty and follow-up angiogram at 6 months (primary end point) was -0.35 +/- 0.51 for the placebo group and -0.37 +/- 0.52, -0.45 +/- 0.52 and -0.412 +/- 0.53, respectively, for the 1-, 5- and 10-mg twice daily cilazapril groups (p = NS). Clinical events during follow-up did not differ among the four study groups. Multivariate analysis revealed only six variables as independent predictors of the loss of minimal lumen diameter: duration of angina < 6 months, history of myocardial infarction, minimal lumen diameter before and after angioplasty as well as a proximal lesion location and reference diameters. Traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis did not relate to restenosis.",

    "35": "Ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction involves changes in ventricular size, shape, structure, and matrix that impact on function. Prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after infarction with captopril reduces ventricular enlargement and improves clinical outcome, but whether enalapril produces similar benefits is controversial.", 
    "36": "The effect of enalapril during healing between 1 day and 6 weeks after myocardial infarction on in vivo changes in ventricular size, shape, mass, and function (asynergy, or akinesis and dyskinesis, and ejection fraction), as determined by serial two-dimensional echocardiography, hemodynamics, postmortem topography (planimetered short- and long-axis ventricular contours), and collagen content (determined by levels of hydroxyproline, a marker for collagen), was measured in 25 instrumented dogs. The dogs were randomized 1 day after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to a control group (no treatment) and a group receiving oral enalapril (2.5 mg BID). Compared with no treatment, enalapril produced a sustained lowering of left atrial pressure but no difference in heart rate and mean blood pressure over the 6 weeks. Also compared with no treatment, enalapril modified in vivo remodeling parameters between 1 day and 6 weeks, with less elongation of the asynergy-containing segment, a lower expansion index (ratio of endocardial lengths of infarct to non-infarct-containing segments demarcated by papillary muscle landmarks), less scar wall thinning, a lower thinning ratio (ratio of average thickness of infarcted wall to average thickness of the normal wall), smaller ventricular volume, less regional bulging and aneurysm frequency, prevention of the increase in ventricular mass, less total extent of asynergy, and higher volume ejection fraction. At postmortem examination, scar mass was similar in the two groups, but topographic maps with enalapril revealed less infarct bulging, flatter infarct scars, and less noninfarct wall thickness. In addition, postmortem collagen content was similar in noninfarct zones of the two groups but lower in infarct zones of the dogs given enalapril.", 
    "37": "Prolonged enalapril therapy, in a dose that did not lower blood pressure, during healing after anterior infarction produced prolonged reduction of left ventricular preload in dogs. This diastolic unloading was associated with limitation of remodeling parameters (infarct expansion and thinning, progressive ventricular dilation and hypertrophy, and regional bulging), less total asynergy, and improved left ventricular ejection fraction. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was associated with lower collagen content in the infarct area and altered scar topography, these effects did not impact negatively on overall remodeling and function.", 
    "38": "The past two decades have witnessed tremendous advances in the pharmacologic therapy of patients with left ventricular dysfunction and chronic heart failure. The pharmacologic repertoire has been and continues to be expanded with newer agents carefully subjected to the rigor of well-designed clinical trials. Treatment has consequently evolved from pathophysiologically guided therapy predicated on older concepts to evidence-guided therapy supported by results of major clinical trials that continue to expand the understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex syndrome. The goals of therapy have ambitiously evolved from the immediate symptomatic relief offered by diuretics; to the short-term hemodynamic improvement in the circulation produced by direct vasodilators; to the intermediate-term improvement in functional capacity and exercise tolerance associated with vasodilators, nitrates, and digoxin; and to the final frontier of long-term improvement in morbidity and survival associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. In addition to the expansion of the understanding of the epidemiology, natural history, and pathophysiology of chronic heart failure, several important lessons in clinical pharmacology have been learned from the clinical trials of the last decade. Many other questions, however, remain unanswered. The role of diuretics, although uncontested in the acute stabilization of congested patients, has yet to be rigorously evaluated in stable patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction on ACE inhibitors. The long-term effects of nitrates on morbidity and mortality have not yet been established in patients with either ischemic or nonischemic ventricular dysfunction. Vasodilators as a class, and perhaps because they are not a homogeneous class, have had a mixture of successes and failures. There is no evidence that pure vasodilation in and by itself improves survival. There is ample evidence, however, that it improves the circulation and consequently the response to diuretics. This improvement may translate into intermediate-term improvement in functional capacity, but this benefit is seldom sustained. Hemodynamic improvement in the circulation may not always translate into longer-term improvement in morbidity and reduction in mortality. The syndrome of chronic heart failure from systolic left ventricular dysfunction has emerged as a disease of mechanical dysfunction and maladaptation. The maladaptation is a consequence of deleterious effects of compensatory neurohormonal mechanisms: the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, arginine vasopressin, and most likely a host of other mechanisms. The degree of activation of these mechanisms has been established as a marker of prognosis, and the effects of pharmacologic agents on these mechanisms may well determine their long-term effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The analysis of currently used therapeutic targets provides considerable input in the choice of current and future therapies for dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Of the ion flux agents, a definitive answer concerning digoxin will soon be available. Currently, digoxin is likely of benefit to patients with persistent heart failure and significantly enlarged hearts despite therapy with preload and afterload reducing agents. Most currently available calcium channel blocking agents do not appear to be effective, although newer agents such as amlodipine and felodipine have yet to be adequately tested. Vesnarinone, which operates through the sodium and potassium rectifying channels and has limited phosphodiesterase inhibition, appears to provide a significant improvement in mortality and in symptoms. Part of the latter effect may be due to its anticytokine properties, which are currently being investigated. Analysis of vascular endothelial agents indicate that not all of the vasoactive agents improve survival, as demonstrated with prazosin and flosequinan. The dose of agents may be important, again demonstrating that less is better. Finally, those with additional effects, such as inositol triphosphate stimulation, may offer additional unique properties that may, in the future, provide benefit. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are potentially beneficial in the short term but clearly should be avoided for long-term use. Lower doses of these agents are now being investigated, but the weight of evidence is against agents that operate primarily through phosphodiesterase inhibition. Renin angiotensin agents are the most efficacious of therapies available at this time. New angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are likely to add little to what is already known.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The renin-angiotensin system is intimately involved in the control of sodium and water balance, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, mitogenesis and the regulation of vascular tone. There is evidence that many of these effects may be controlled at a local level by independent tissue renin-angiotensin systems. Drugs that are specific inhibitors of the cascade have proved powerful tools for dissecting the physiology of the renin-angiotensin system, and are of major benefit in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure. Recent evidence suggests that variations in the genes coding for components of the system may affect the risk of developing hypertension and ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "41": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy has been associated with a substantial (> or = 20%) reduction in the risk of major ischemic events in two recent clinical trials with long-term follow-up: Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) and the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study. Participants in these studies included patients with a low ejection fraction (< or = 0.35 in SOLVD and < or = 0.40 in SAVE), generally without symptoms of congestive heart failure. Approximately 80% of patients enrolled in SOLVD and all participants in SAVE had histories of ischemic heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (SAVE). In both SOLVD and SAVE the risk of experiencing a major ischemic event such as myocardial infarction was reduced significantly following prolonged ACE inhibitor therapy. In the SOLVD trial, this effect was evident across a range of patient subgroups, including varying concomitant drug therapies. In both studies, several months elapsed before this benefit became apparent, suggesting an effect on underlying ischemic pathophysiology. A third trial of ACE inhibitor therapy postinfarction, the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) Study, demonstrated a 27% reduction in all cause mortality but no effect on myocardial infarction after a 15-month mean follow-up. No effect of ACE inhibition on risk of survival or reinfarction was reported in the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS-II), which began the drug within 24 hours of infarction and terminated follow-up at 6 months, a time not likely to demonstrate infarction reduction benefit based on the SOLVD and SAVE observations. Neither AIRE nor CONSENSUS-II had objectively determined left ventricular dysfunction as an entry criterion, as did SOLVD and SAVE, but AIRE mandated \"clinical\" congestive heart failure prior to randomization. More recently, preliminary results from the third Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-3), the Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-4), and the Chinese Captopril Trial suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor mortality benefits post-myocardial infarction would be detected in these megatrials as early as 35 days after the event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "42": "An understanding of the role of the aortic elastic properties indicates their relevance at several sites of cardiovascular function. Acting as an elastic buffering chamber behind the heart (the Windkessel function), the aorta and some of the proximal large vessels store about 50% of the left ventricular stroke volume during systole. In diastole, the elastic forces of the aortic wall forward this 50% of the volume to the peripheral circulation, thus creating a nearly continuous peripheral blood flow. This systolic-diastolic interplay represents the Windkessel function, which has an influence not only on the peripheral circulation but also on the heart, resulting in a reduction of left ventricular afterload and improvement in coronary blood flow and left ventricular relaxation. The elastic resistance (or stiffness), which the aorta sets against its systolic distention, increases with aging, with an increase in blood pressure, and with pathological changes such as atherosclerosis. This increased stiffness leads to an increase in systolic blood pressure and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure at any given mean pressure, an increase in systolic blood velocity, an increase in left ventricular afterload, and a decrease in subendocardial blood supply during diastole, and must be considered a major pathophysiological factor, for example, in systolic hypertension. The elastic properties of the aortic Windkessel can be assessed in vivo in humans in several ways, most easily by measuring the pulse wave velocity along the aorta. The higher this velocity, the higher the elastic resistance, that is, the stiffness. Other methods depend on assessment of the ratio between pulse pressure and aortic volume changes (delata P/delta V), which can be assessed noninvasively by ultrasonic or tomographic methods. All assessments of vessel stiffness have to take into account the direct effect of current blood pressure, and thus judgements about influences of interventions rely on an unchanged blood pressure. Alternatively, to derive the \"intrinsic\" stiffness of the aortic wall one has to correct for the effect of the blood pressure present. Recently reports about pharmacologic influences on the elastic properties of the aorta have emerged in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Despite the findings in randomized trials of a significant effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing morbidity and mortality of patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, the morbidity and mortality of these patients remains relatively high. One potential strategy to further improve morbidity and mortality in these patients is blockade of a aldosterone. Many clinicians have assumed that ACE inhibitors would block both angiotensin II and aldosterone. However, there are data to suggest that aldosterone production may \"escape\" despite the use of an ACE inhibitor. An escape of aldosterone production has several important consequences, including: sodium retention, potassium and magnesium loss, myocardial collagen production, ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial norepinephrine release, endothelial dysfunction, and a decrease in serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Due to the potential importance of these mechanisms, the finding that there is a significant correlation between aldosterone production and mortality in patients with heart failure, as well as evidence that an aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, when administered to patients with heart failure treated with conventional therapy including an ACE inhibitor results in increased diuresis and symptomatic improvement, an international prospective multicenter study has been organized, the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES Pilot Study), to evaluate the safety of blocking the effects of aldosterone in patients with heart failure treated with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "44": "The effects of fosinopril and nifedipine on left ventricular (LV) mass were evaluated in 35 hypertensive patients with LV mass index greater than 110 g/m2 in female and 130 g/m2 in male patients. The goal of therapy was also to obtain a seated diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of less than 90 mmHg. The patients were studied by echocardiography after 2 weeks of placebo treatment and 4, 12, and 24 weeks of monotherapy with active drugs. Both fosinopril and nifedipine reduced SDBP to a normal level after 6 months of treatment (p < .001). Regression of LV hypertrophy was achieved by either agent (p < .001), with fosinopril being more effective than nifedipine (p < .002). In conclusion, both fosinopril and nifedipine effectively reduce SDBP and achieve important regression of LV hypertrophy.", 
    "45": "We studied the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on the response of arterial intima after balloon denudation. Captopril (3 mg.kg-1/d) was administered to 4 miniature pigs after abdominal aortic balloon denudation. As controls, 4 pigs were only denuded abdominal aorta without using captopril. All animals were given high cholesterol diet immediately after abdominal aortic denudation. At the end of the 6th and 10th month, 8 pigs were sacrificed equally in two times. Irregular protrusion of arterial wall was observed in all animals at gross anatomy. In the control group, the atherosclerotic plaque was identified via sudan stains. The neointima proliferative response after arterial denudation was found, but the degree of neointima proliferation at captopril group was significantly decreased as compared to non-captopril group (P < 0.01). Microscopic examination showed smooth muscle cell proliferation of arterial neointima in non-captopril group, while slight connective tissue proliferation in captopril group. Electronmicroscopically endothelial cells showed protrusion and their connective gap was increased in the control group. Many platelets were adhered to the arterial neointima, the smooth muscle cells were mainly of secretary type in the same group. The endothelial cells were normal, smooth muscle cells of the neointima were mainly of contractile type in the captopril group. These results illustrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor inhibits the proliferative response after arterial intima denudation, on the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme may play an important role in neointima proliferative response after intima injury.",

Balloon angioplasty was performed in model animals. Captopril-treated (n = 8, captopril 12.5 mg.kg-1/d) group which received captopril 7 days before to 4 wk after angioplasty were examined by dot blot hybridization.

    "47": "To explore the mechanisms by which angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) prevents the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), captopril (Cap 100 mg.kg-1/d was administered orally to male spontaneously hypertensive rats from intrauterine period to 16 weeks of age. Male and age-matched untreated WKY rats and SHR were used as controls. Experiments were performed at 40 weeks of age. SBP, left ventricular weight to body weight ratio (LVW/BW), myocardial hydroxyproline (Hypro) and norepinephrine (NE) were determined. The levels of c-myc and c-fos mRNA in the left ventricle were measured by Northern blot. Early-onset Cap therapy significantly decreased SBP at 16 weeks of age. After discontinuance of treatment for 24 weeks, SBP of SHRcap was still maintained at a level lower than that of untreated SHR. LVW/BW and Hypro in SHR cap were markedly reduced. The expression of myocardial c-myc mRNA (n = 5) was decreased by 72% in SHRcap compared with that in the untreated SHR, but the expression of c-fos mRNA (n = 7) and NE was not different between the untreated SHR, SHRcap and WKY rats. These results indicate that early Cap treatment may permanently prevent the development of hypertension, inhibit myocardial hypertrophy (MH), and interstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, the prevention of MH is associated with a decrease in myocardial c-myc mRNA levels, and the development and regression of MH may be irrelevant to proto-oncogene c-fos expression.",

The CZE method achieved better selectivity for several degradants of interest within a much shorter analysis time than did the LC method.

    "50": "Human skin fibroblasts produce in culture an elastase-type metalloendopeptidase which can hydrolyze synthetic elastase-substrate as Suc ala3 pNA and degrade also elastic fibers when injected in the dermis or deposited on cryostat-skin sections [3-8]. Here we describe further characterization of this enzyme activity using metallo-enzyme inhibitors as well as specific inhibitors of known Zn-endopeptidases such as angiotensin converting enzyme and enkephalinase. Among the metal complexing agents tested only EDTA and o-phenanthrolin could inhibit the elastase-type activity of fibroblasts, other known metal complexing substances capable of reacting with Zn (2,2' dipyridyl, diethyl dithiocarbamate and other metal chelators) were ineffective as was also lisinopril, an ACE-inhibitor [13]. Phosphoramidon and retrothiorphan, specific enkephalinase inhibitors [12] did strongly inhibit the elastase type activity of human skin fibroblasts (IC50 10(-8) M). Ethanol at conc-s used to dissolve organic, water insoluble inhibitors (50-100 microliters/ml) strongly inhibited the enzyme. It appears that the metal prosthetic group of fibroblast elastase (presumably, Zn) is not directly accessible to several of the low M. Wt complexing agents. The efficiency of enkephalinase inhibitors suggest a possible relationship between this enzyme and fibroblast-elastase.", 
    "51": "The effect of intensified blood pressure (BP) control with a reduction of the diastolic BP to < or = 85 mm Hg on renal function and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was studied in 28 men with primary hypertension (aged 62 to 72 years) treated for 13 +/- 5 years with beta-blockade, diuretics, or hydralazine. They were compared with 25 normotensive (NT) men of similar age. At baseline (BL), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) (clearance of inulin and para-aminohippurate), and the UAE were studied. Thereafter, all antihypertensive drugs except beta-blockers were withdrawn and either felodipine (5 to 20 mg; n = 13) or ramipril (2.5 to 10 mg; n = 15) was added in a double blind, randomized fashion. Hydrochlorothiazide was added if necessary. The investigations were repeated after 6 weeks and 1 year of double-blind treatment. At BL, the BP and the renal vascular resistance (RVR) were significantly higher and GFR and RPF were significantly lower in both hypertensive groups than in NT. After 1 year, the BP treatment goal was reached by all patients in the felodipine group but only by two-thirds in the ramipril group in spite of addition of diuretics to 60% of the latter group. In the felodipine group, the BP, GFR, and RVR after 1 year no longer differed significantly from normal. The UAE and the fractional albumin clearance increased significantly after 1 year's treatment in the felodipine group but did not change in the ramipril group. The fractional albumin clearance, however, did not differ significantly from normal either at BL or after 1 year's treatment in any of the hypertensive groups. It is therefore possible to reduce BP and improve renal function in primary hypertension to levels not significantly different from normal after treatment with felodipine in combination with beta-blockade. Although this regimen increased the low UAE slightly, the fractional albumin clearance changed less and did not differ significantly from normal. The ramipril/beta-blocker combination reduced BP less and did not change the slightly reduced renal function or the UAE.", 
    "52": "We previously described delayed pressor response (DPR) 3 h after endothelin (ET)-1 injection in normotensive rats. In the current study, we examined effects of the ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 (0.01 mumol/kg/min intravenously, i.v.), phosphoramidon (100 mumol/kg i.v.), the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor SQ28603 (112 mumol/kg + 0.04 mumol/kg/min i.v.), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (10 mumol/kg i.v.), and the thromboxane receptor antagonist, SQ29548 (0.5 mumol/kg + 0.5 mumol/kg/h i.v.) on DPR. Vehicle and ET-1 (1.0 nmol/kg i.v.) were administered on day 1; vehicle or drug and ET-1 were administered on day 2. BQ123 inhibited DPR 36% (vehicle 44 +/- 5, BQ123 28 +/- 3 mm Hg); phosphoramidon inhibited DPR 56% (vehicle 45 +/- 4, and phosphoramidon 20 +/- 5 mm Hg). DPR was unchanged after SQ28603 (vehicle 39 +/- 2 and SQ28603 44 +/- 2 mm Hg), enalaprilat (vehicle 39 +/- 2 and enalaprilat 38 +/- 7 mm Hg), or SQ29548 (vehicle 46 +/- 6 and SQ29548 43 +/- 3 mm Hg). The results suggest that DPR 3 h after ET-1 injection in rats is mediated in part through ETA receptors. DPR does not appear to involve thromboxane or synthesis of angiotensin II (AII), but may be related to synthesis of ET-1.",

A pressor experiment demonstrated that 100 mg/kg fosinopril or captopril almost completely inhibited ACE activity in vivo. Another study established that feeding hamsters 0.05% cholesterol and 10% coconut oil resulted in rapid and progressive accumulation of oil red O-stained macrophage-foam cells in the aortic arch. In the regression study, three groups of hamsters were fed the same atherogenic diet for 4 weeks to induce fatty lesions in the arch. After 4 weeks, plasma lipids, blood pressure (BP), and atherosclerosis were quantified in control hamsters. Beginning at 4 weeks, the two remaining groups of hamsters were treated with 100 mg/kg/day fosinopril or 100 mg/kg/day captopril for 6 more weeks while receiving the atherogenic diet. After 6-week treatment, plasma lipids, BP, and atherosclerosis were quantified in the two treated groups (i.e., study week 10), and they were compared with the 4-week controls. As compared with that in controls, fosinopril decreased plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterols by approximately 69%. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased by 16% and total triglycerides decreased by 56% as compared with that of controls. Captopril did not alter LDL plus VLDL cholesterols or total triglycerides, but HDL cholesterol decreased by 24% as compared with that of the control group.

    "54": "The effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and a Japanese medicinal plant named sairei-to, after administration either alone or in combination, on survival-time due to the protection of proteinuria and the preserving of renal function, was studied in the rat with subtotal nephrectomy. Resection of 2/3 of the left kidney and removal of the right kidney was performed in 28 male Wister rats (220-250 g). The rats were divided into four groups: (1) control (without sairei-to or enalapril); (2) with sairei-to (2.5% in rat chow); (3) with enalapril (50 mg/l in drinking water); and (4) the combination of enalapril and sairei-to. The actual survival-times until natural death after renal ablation in these four groups were 92 +/- 3, 128 +/- 8, 199 +/- 19, and 194 +/- 13 days, respectively. Urinary protein excretion and renal function were markedly protected in the enalapril-treated rats. Urinary endothelin excretion was also attenuated in enalapril-treated rats. Statistical analysis revealed the absence of benefits with sairei-to alone or in combination treatment. In conclusion, enalapril provides protection of proteinuria and preserves renal function, which results in a longer survival-time in the rats having subtotal nephrectomy. However, sairei-to does not show such beneficial effects.", 
    "55": "The primary objective in this multicentre, double-blind randomised, parallel study was to compare the metabolic effects of 12 months of treatment with an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) with those of a selective beta-blocker (atenolol) in patients with mild hypertension. The patients (35-69 years of age) were included if they were without antihypertensive drugs and after six months of nonpharmacological treatment had supine DBPs between 90 and 104 mmHg; 220 patients were randomised to enalapril (20 or 40 mg/day) and 218 to atenolol (50 or 100 mg/day). After 12 months of treatment, atenolol significantly increased the glucose concentrations at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after an oral intake of 75 g glucose (P < 0.01), while enalapril did not. Atenolol significantly increased fasting blood glucose and insulin concentration 120 minutes after glucose intake, while enalapril did not. Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides increased significantly in patients having atenolol but not in those having enalapril. HDL cholesterol decreased significantly in the atenolol group but not in the enalapril group. The proportions of patients with clinical adverse experiences were similar in both treatment groups. These results indicate that enalapril does not influence either glucose tolerance or lipoprotein metabolism while atenolol does. These findings are consistent over the 12 month treatment period and confirm earlier short-term study results.", 
    "56": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ramipril and nitrendipine on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and impaired renal function. Forty patients with mild hypertension with NIDDM and persistent albuminuria (> 300 mg/24h) were studied. After a 3-week run-in period on placebo, patients were randomly treated with ramipril 5 mg once daily or nitrendipine 20 mg once daily for 6 months, according to a double-blind design. Blood pressure (BP), UAE, creatinine clearance and glycosilated haemoglobin were evaluated at the end of the placebo period and after 1,3 and 6 months of active treatment. Both ramipril and nitrendipine significantly lowered BP values without affecting glucose homeostasis and renal function. Despite equivalent BP control, only ramipril afforded a significant reduction in UAE, thus suggesting that the antiproteinuric effect of ramipril is at least partially independent of its anti-hypertensive effect.",

Similar values were noted in hepatically impaired patients: 926.0 +/- 293.9 ng.hr/mL and 1,255.4 +/- 434.0 ng.hr/mL for first dose and steady-state, respectively. No statistically significant differences were detected in fosinoprilat pharmacokinetic values between healthy and hepatically impaired subjects. Absence of accumulation can be attributed to the dual route of elimination of fosinoprilat reported in previous studies. Renal excretion of fosinoprilat in hepatically impaired patients prevents increased accumulation. The present findings suggest that the starting dose of fosinopril used in hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function can also be used in patients with hepatic impairment secondary to cirrhosis.", 
    "58": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was incubated with 20 microM of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, fosinopril and quinapril or ethanol. Oxidation of LDL was initiated by addition of CuSO4 and monitored for production of conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid peroxides. The inhibition of production of conjugated dienes was expressed as the lag phase in minutes. The lag phase for control samples was 55.2 +/- 6.1 (mean +/- s.e. mean) min and for captopril 86.4 +/- 7.0 min (P = 0.0058). Quinapril had a small but nonsignificant effect, fosinopril and ethanol had no effect. LDL incubated with captopril showed only 13.8% of TBARS and 22.7% of lipid peroxides produced by control (100%) after 1 h. Increasing concentrations of captopril showed a linear increase in the lag phase. We conclude that captopril increases the resistance of LDL to copper-induced oxidation.",

Before treatment serum ACE activity differed significantly between the genotypes, with serum ACE activity 56% higher in DD than II subjects, and the genotype explaining 40% of between-subject variance in serum ACE activity. 3. After oral enalapril 10 mg the absolute fall in serum ACE activity was significantly larger in DD than II subjects at 2, 4, and 6 h (by 9.0 (95% CI 0.7-17.2), 10.7 (3.8-17.6), and 9.7 (2.8-16.6) nmol ml-1 min-1 respectively), but not at 24 h (fall in II > DD by 1.1 (-8.9 to 6.7) nmol ml-1 min-1). 4.

Eighty-eight of 97 (91%) patients experienced a repeat of their cough symptoms. Sixty-four patients entered the double-blind part of the study where they were treated with enalapril 20 mg and a renin inhibitor for up to 4 weeks in random order. These periods were separated by a minimum 4 week placebo wash out. 3. Of 59 evaluable patients who received enalapril a second time, 37 (62.7%) experienced cough again. Of 62 patients on the renin inhibitor 16 (25.8%) experienced cough, however as it was not equi-efficacious to enalapril no valid comparison could be made. 4. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cough is not reproducible within patients, as other factors are involved in the aetiology.

    "61": "1. The aim of this study was to analyse the pharmacological characteristics, and second-messenger coupling-mechanisms, of bradykinin B1 receptors in an intact tissue, the rabbit urinary bladder; and to investigate the influence of inhibition of endogenous peptidases on kinin activities. 2. In preparations of rabbit mucosa-free urinary bladder, at 90 min after mounting of the preparations, bradykinin (1 nM-10 microM) evoked contractile responses. In contrast, the B1 receptor-selective agonist [des-Arg9]-BK (10 mM-10 microM) was only weakly active at this time. Contractile responses to [des-Arg9]-BK increased with time of tissue incubation in the organ bath, reaching a maximum after 3 h, when the pD2 estimates were 6.4 +/- 0.3 for bradykinin, and 6.9 +/- 0.2 for [des-Arg9]-BK. 3. Once stabilized, responses to [des-Arg9]-BK in the bladder were competitively antagonized by the B1 receptor-selective antagonists [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK and D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8,des-Arg9]-BK ([des-Arg10]-Hoe140) (pKB estimates were 6.1 +/- 0.1 and 7.1 +/- 0.1, respectively; n = 17-21), but responses were unaffected by the B2 receptor-selective antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK (Hoe140) (100 nM; n = 4). Contractile responses to bradykinin itself were partially, but significantly, inhibited by the B1 receptor-selective antagonist, [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK (10 microM) (P < 0.05), or by the B2 receptor-selective antagonist Hoe140 (100 nM) (P < 0.005) alone, and were largely blocked by a combination of the two antagonists (P < 0.0001). 4. The combined presence of the carboxypeptidase inhibitor DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoicacid (mergetpa; 10 microM), the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, phosphoramidon (1 microM),and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat (1 microM) increased the potency of bradykinin17 fold (P<0.001), but that of [des-Argl-BK was unchanged (P>0.05): pD2 estimates were 7.6 +/- 0.1 and 6.8 +/- 0.1 for bradykinin and [des-Argl-BK, respectively, in treated preparations. In the presence of peptidase inhibitors, the affinities of the antagonists [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK and [des-Arg'j-Hoel4O were unchanged as compared with those determined in the absence of peptidase inhibitors (P> 0.05).[Leu8,des-Argj-BK inhibited responses to bradykinin under these conditions (n = 4).5. In endothelium-denuded preparations of the rabbit isolated aorta, an archetypal B1 receptor preparation,contractile responses to the B1 receptor-selective agonist [des-Argl-BK (10nM- 1O0 AM) (and to bradykinin) increased progressively with time of tissue incubation; and [des-Argl-BK responses were completely antagonized by the B. receptor antagonist [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK (pKB 6.3 +/- 0.2; n = 13).6. In experiments measuring stimulation of hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol in rabbit urinary bladder,[des-Argl-BK (10 microM- 1 mM), and bradykinin (100 microM) significantly increased accumulation of inositol phosphates (P<0.0001). The increase in accumulation of inositol phosphates evoked by [des-Arg9]-BK(10 microM - 1 mM) was significantly inhibited by [des-Arg'j-Hoe 140 (10 microM) (P <0.01).7. We conclude that in the mucosa-free rabbit urinary bladder, [des-Argl-BK evokes contraction largely via activation of B1 receptors which have similar properties, including time-dependent induction,to B1 receptors in the rabbit isolated aorta. Bradykinin evokes contraction via stimulation of both B1 and B2 receptors, but does not require conversion by peptidases in order to activate B1 receptors. We demonstrate, for the first time, B1 receptor-coupling to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in an intact tissue preparation.", 
    "62": "Antihypertensive therapy has been used for almost 40 years to reduce blood pressure and to prevent morbidity and mortality related to the hypertensive state. Cardiovascular events are related to the initial elevation of blood pressure; the benefits of treating malignant, severe or moderate hypertension are well established. Although large scale clinical trials have demonstrated a decrease in morbid events when mildly elevated blood pressures is treated, the benefits are neither universal or dramatic and treatment is certainly less cost effective than no treatment. Recently it has been emphasised that the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is determined only in part by blood pressure, and that it is also influenced by age, gender, race and the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors. For example, in older individuals where the absolute risk of vascular complications is greater than in younger individuals for any given level of blood pressure, the benefits of therapy will be greater. It has been suggested that in younger individuals with mild hypertension and a low absolute risk of developing cardiovascular morbid events it may be more appropriate to monitor the effects of drug therapy on measures of cardiac and vascular damage that are associated with the hypertensive state. Drug therapy has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing the incidence of stroke, congestive cardiac failure and renal failure associated with elevated blood pressure. Meta-analysis of randomised large scale clinical trials indicates that drug therapy may not reduce coronary events to the extent expected in patients with hypertension. One plausible explanation is that the trials have been of insufficient duration to detect the benefit of blood pressure lowering on coronary heart disease. It has also been suggested that certain adverse metabolic effects associated with the use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers employed in these trials may have partially offset the benefits of blood pressure reduction. However, the clinical significance of these drug-induced metabolic disturbances remains unclear. Experimental data suggesting differences in the ability of antihypertensive drugs to inhibit atherosclerosis in animal models are also of interest, but again the relation of the findings to the clinical situation is unknown. Thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha-blockers can produce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). While LVH is clearly a strong and independent predictor for coronary disease, it remains to be shown that a lower risk for coronary morbid events exists in patients whose LVH has undergone regression over and above that attributable to blood pressure reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Twenty-four patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery were studied. Either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat, 0.06 mg/kg, (n = 12), or saline solution (= control group; n = 12), was randomly and blindly administered intravenously when the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) increased to 90 mmHg after induction of anesthesia. Cardiorespiratory parameters were studied before injection, during the subsequent 30 minutes, precardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), post-CPB, and at the end of surgery. MAP was significantly reduced 5 minutes after administration of enalaprilat. The peak reduction of blood pressure was observed after 30 minutes (from 98 +/- 4 to 68 +/- 8 mmHg). Even immediately before CPB (112 +/- 12 minutes after injection of enalaprilat), MAP and systemic vascular resistance were significantly lower than baseline values. Heart rate remained almost unchanged in both groups. Cardiac index increased slightly in the enalaprilat patients (maximum: +0.75 L/min/m2 20 minutes after injection). Filling pressures (central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) were also significantly reduced by enalaprilat. There were no differences from the control patients with regard to changes in right ventricular hemodynamics (right ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular end-diastolic volume, right ventricular end-systolic volume), pulmonary gas exchange (PaO2), or intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting (Qs/Qt). VO2 increased only in the enalaprilat patients (from 179 +/- 28 to 230 +/- 30 mL/min) (p < 0.05).

    "64": "Asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and complex ventricular arrhythmias in elderly persons without heart disease should not be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and complex ventricular arrhythmias in elderly persons are associated with an increased incidence of coronary events, primary ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, especially if abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy or silent ischaemia are present. beta-Blockers should be used in the treatment of elderly patients with ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemic or nonischaemic heart disease if there are no contraindications to beta-blocker therapy. I would reserve the use of amiodarone in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in elderly patients who cannot tolerate or who do not respond to beta-blockers. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used in treating elderly patients with ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with congestive heart failure. In patients with ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, I would use beta-blockers plus ACE inhibitors. If elderly patients have life-threatening, recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs, invasive intervention is indicated. Until the results of prospective, randomised, clinical trials evaluating the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator are available, I recommend using the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in elderly patients who have medically refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "65": "Scavenging of superoxide radical by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (CAP), a thiol compound, was studied by several investigators and the results were contradictory; while some reported a high superoxide scavenging activity of CAP others found that CAP removed superoxide inefficiently. In this work we show that in the presence of copper ions the apparent rate of superoxide removal by CAP (molar ratio CAP:CuSO4 4:1) was two orders of magnitude higher (approximately 1.5 x 10(5) M-1s-1 at pH 7.4) than the literature value for superoxide scavenging by CAP alone (< 10(3) M-1s-1 at pH 7.4). We presume that in the presence of copper ions a CAP/copper complex with a SOD-mimicking activity is being formed. Similar results were also obtained with another thiol glutathione (GSH). The possible role of the CAP/copper complexes in the anti-inflammatory effect of CAP is discussed.",

This study examines the effect of high-dose ramipril, an ACE inhibitor that does not contain a sulfhydryl group, on the development of intimal hyperplasia in experimental vein bypass grafts. Twenty New Zealand White rabbits underwent common carotid interposition bypass grafting. Twelve were treated with ramipril (2 mg/kg/day; po) five days prior to surgery and thereafter until harvest. The remaining 8 animals were used as controls. Vein grafts were harvested at twenty-eight days by pressure fixation (80 mmHg). The grafts were sectioned into proximal, middle, and distal thirds, and the thickness of the intima and the media and the area of the lumen from each segment were determined by videomorphometry. The effect of ramipril on the [H3]thymidine incorporation into DNA of serum-stimulated smooth muscle cells (culture passage 6 to 12) was also assessed. There was a 50% mortality rate in the rabbits that received ramipril, and this was assumed to be related to the high dose of the drug. Ramipril treatment reduced mean vein graft intimal area by 34% (P > 0.05), but this was accompanied by an increase of 73% in the mean medial area of the vein grafts as compared with controls. These changes resulted in a decrease in the mean intimal ratio (intima/[intima + media]) by 39% in the ramipril group as compared with controls.

    "67": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is frequent in hypertension although there is no close correlation between the level of blood pressure and the cardiac mass. The HYCAR study has shown a dissociation in the reversibility of left ventricular hypertrophy: ramipril at doses of 1.25 or 5 mg per day reduces left ventricular mass independently of its effects on the blood pressure. Nevertheless, it remains to be shown by a prospective study that the reduction of the blood pressure and the cardiac mass have additional benefits in the prevention of coronary artery disease in hypertensive subjects. In the meantime, two points resume the objectives of treatment of hypertension with respect to left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary risk. Firstly, prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy is better than its cure. Early prevention is based on accurate measurement and interpretation of the blood pressure according to international recommendations. Prevention necessitates good control of the blood pressure and it would appear to be particularly effective in patients who respond well to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Secondly, when left ventricular hypertrophy is present, it is possible to reduce the left ventricular mass: however, it remains to be seen whether this is accompanied by a normalisation of structure and function. This requires control of the blood pressure using either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in good responders to this family of drugs or another type of antihypertensive agent. In the latter case, the association of a low dose of ramipril may be envisaged when left ventricular hypertrophy persists despite good control of the blood pressure. This hypothesis requires testing with an appropriate prospective therapeutic trial.", 
    "68": "The role of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the regulation of local synthesis of angiotensin II has not been clearly defined. The authors investigated the local factors which might orientate the effects of ACE inhibitors to particular organs in the Wistar rat. The in vivo study of the effects of low doses of ramipril on the myocardium showed that cardiac ACE was significantly inhibited by the non-antihypertensive dose of 0.01 mg/kg whereas the inhibition only occurred from doses higher than 0.1 mg/kg in the other tissues studied. In the kidney: the affinity of 3H-ramiprilate for the brush borders of the proximal tubular cells was increased by high concentrations of chloride ions as observed in the renal parenchyma, the presence of esterases makes local activation of ramipril (diester) into ramiprilate (active diacid) possible, prolonged treatment with ramipril leads to a lowering of the concentration of ACE in the brush border of the proximal tubular cells, verified after the elimination of the ACE inhibitor fixed on the tissue. These data indicate that the myocardium and the kidney could be privileged targets of the action of ramipril.",

Furosemide was continued during the double blind treatment period. Echocardiography and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were performed just before the randomisation and at 6 months.

    "70": "In renal hypertensive rats with pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, given in a high blood pressure lowering dose as well as in a low, non-antihypertensive dose, prevented and regressed left ventricular hypertrophy. These beneficial effects were abolished by coadministration of the specific bradykinin receptor antagonist (HOE 140) in the prevention--but not in the regression studies. Vascular function of rats with pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy was impaired, whereas treated animals showed a reversal to normal. The angiotensin II subtype AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, was barely active in the prevention, however markedly active in the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. From these experimental studies in rats with pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy and vascular dysfunction we conclude that inhibition of bradykinin degradation induced by ramipril may contribute to the antihypertrophic action during the prevention phase, whereas attenuation of angiotensin II formation may be more important during the regression period. In another model, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR and stroke prone SHR)--a non-renal hypertensive model--cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy could be reduced by chronic high-dose ramipril treatment in prevention and regression studies, whereas the low dose regimen only reduced left ventricular hypertrophy in the regression experiments. In addition, both doses improved the myocardial capillary supply to the heart leading to improved function and metabolism. In comparison, vascular hypertrophy of the mesenteric artery could only be prevented by early-onset high dose treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor but not once hypertrophy has been established.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "1. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how angiotensin I (AI), angiotensin II (AII), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor; ACE-I) and a serine proteinase inhibitor contribute to the protein metabolism of cultured newborn spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) heart cells. We examined the uptake of [3H]-uridine and [3H]-proline into cultured cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. 2. Both AI and AII increased the uptake of [3H]-uridine into myocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the effect of AI was denied in the presence of the ACE-I with the concentration of 10(-6) g/mL. Both AI and AII increased the uptake of [3H]-proline into cardiac fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner. However, this effect was only partially abolished in the presence of 10(-6) g/mL of the ACE-I, which was the maximal concentration that did not exert any effect on the [3H]-proline uptake. In the presence of AII receptor antagonist, [Sar1, Leu8]-AII, the uptake of [3H]-proline into cardiac fibroblasts was completely inhibited. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of AI on the uptake of [3H]-proline into cardiac fibroblasts were completely inhibited in the presence of a serine proteinase inhibitor in addition to the ACE-I. 3. These results suggest that an ACE-I has different effects on protein metabolism in the heart and also suggest the presence of serine proteinase in cultured cardiac fibroblasts from SHR.",

Its antihypertensive effect is produced by a reduction in the smooth muscle tone of peripheral vascular beds resulting in a decrease in total peripheral resistance without significant effect on cardiac output or heart rate. In benign prostatic hyperplasia, doxazosin's effect of relieving bladder outflow obstruction is produced through a reduction in prostatic tone mediated via alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. In most comparative trials doxazosin has proven to be equally effective as the comparator drug in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It has been used in a variety of patient populations including the elderly, Blacks, smokers, and patients with concomitant disease states such as renal dysfunction, hypercholesterolaemia, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and respiratory disease. Doxazosin has also been used successfully in combination with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, diuretics, calcium channel antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with hypertension that is uncontrolled with monotherapy. Doxazosin has a beneficial effect on some of the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease including elevated serum lipid levels, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy. Modest decreases in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides are seen with doxazosin therapy while small increases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and the high density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio are consistently reported. Some studies have reported an improvement in glucose tolerance although this effect has been more consistently seen in nondiabetic patients than in patients with NIDDM. Additionally, doxazosin produces a similar reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy to other antihypertensive agents. Modelling-based calculations suggest that doxazosin significantly reduces the risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, although this remains to be confirmed in long term prospective studies. Doxazosin appears to be a promising agent in the treatment of urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

One SR+, the thyroxine-binding globulin, a high-affinity thyroid hormone binder, emerged as a particularly reliable senescence biomarker, showing the highest aging-related variation (8-fold increase from 6 to 30 mo) and not belonging to the APR class. Chronic treatment with perindopril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor used in heart and renal disease therapy, significantly enhanced thyroxine-binding capacity, possibly by preventing age-related alterations of serum lipids. Serum protein patterns prove valuable both as indexes for selecting aging animals free from superimposed pathologies and as parameters of senescence-induced changes in protein biosynthesis.", 
    "88": "The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (Lisinopril, MSD) or calcium blocker (Nifedipine retard, MSD) treatment during three months on blood pressure (measured with sphygmomanometric method and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring--ABPM) and urinary albumin excretion in essential hypertension class I acc. to WHO. Fifteen untreated patients aged 38 +/- 5 years with essential hypertension participated in the study and received diet with normal sodium content. Urinary albumin excretion was measured by RIA method in two 24 hour urine collections and mean value was calculated. ABPM was measured with Spacelabs monitor. After first examination 8 patients were randomly selected for the treatment with lisinopril and 7 patients to the treatment with nifedipine. The doses of both drugs were gradually adjusted to reach diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. After 3 months of treatment urinary albumin excretion and blood pressure was found in both after treatment in patients treated with lisinopril but not in those receiving nifedipine. In patients treated with lisinopril a correlation between the decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (measured by ABPM) and decrease of urinary albumin excretion was demonstrated. It was concluded that the normalization of blood pressure induced by lisinopril treatment in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension and normoalbuminuria is accompanied with significant diminution of urinary albumin excretion which suggests preventive action of the drug in the development of microalbuminuria. Diminution of urinary albumin excretion caused by lisinopril is probably due to both the decrease of blood pressure and the specific renal action of the drug.", 
    "89": "Congestive left heart failure can be treated using three main strategies: change preload to optimize the Frank-Starling relationship, decrease after-load to reduce external work and increase cardiac contractility by inotropic stimulation. The third option is reviewed in this article, which discusses the pharmacological and clinical effects of different inotropic drugs as known in 1994. It is concluded that digitalis should be considered apart from other inotropic drugs. Even when in sinus rhythm, digitalis seems reasonable as an adjuvans to after-load reduction and diuretics. Chronic use of other inotropic drugs for congestive left heart failure is not recommended.",

In the paper there were included and described in detail the following classes: piracetam-type compounds, co-dergocrine-type compounds, vasodilators and haemorheological agents, cholinesterase inhibitors, ACTH and vasopressin analogs and angiotensin II and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Some compounds e.g. propentofylline, vincamine, THA and RA-octil were described in more detail.", 
    "92": "In the present review, the possibilities of ergometric and pharmacological \"intervention\" with a view to improving the validity of scintirenography are reported. Exercise renography at present does not have a defined role in clinical routine. This procedure, however, gives additional information in hypertensive patients with respect to renal ischemia. Captopril scintirenography can be recommended as a screening test for renovascular hypertension. Furosemide-\"intervention\" differentiates between obstructive uropathy and dilatation of renal collecting system without obstruction. This is true especially in newborns with congenital abnormalities of the upper urinary tract, in order to stratify these young patients for surgical or conservative treatment.", 
    "93": "Patients with advanced heart failure often remain severely symptomatic and have a high mortality rate despite currently available therapy. We studied the safety and efficacy of a new approach to the patient with refractory heart failure: continuous intravenous treatment via a portable infusion pump with epoprostenol (prostacyclin), a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. A group of 33 patients with severe heart failure (64% New York Heart Association class IV and 36% class III) and profound ventricular dysfunction (median left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.15)--despite prior treatment with diuretics (100%), digitalis (91%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (85%), and dobutamine (30%)--underwent a baseline 6-minute walk test prior to dose titration with epoprostenol during invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Subjects responding during the dose titration were randomized, on an open basis, to receive either continuous epoprostenol infusion via an indwelling central venous catheter plus conventional therapy or conventional therapy alone for 12 weeks. The initial dose-ranging study with epoprostenol produced a significant decline in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and a substantial increase in cardiac index despite a fall in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Symptoms related to vasodilation were noted within the first week after randomization to epoprostenol in 9 of 16 patients but resolved with adjustment of the infusion and concomitant medications in all but one subject. Dose adjustments during the chronic epoprostenol infusion were infrequent after the first week and complications related to the drug delivery system were rare. The change in distance walked from baseline to the last available 6-minute walk test was significantly greater in patients who received epoprostenol compared with patients assigned to standard therapy (72 +/- 40 vs -39 +/- 32 m, mean +/- SEM; p = 0.033). Our study suggests that long-term intravenous infusion of epoprostenol is feasible in patients with severe heart failure and our hemodynamic and functional results suggest clinical benefit as well. However, until recent results indicating an adverse effect of epoprostenol on survival are fully evaluated, the role of this drug in the treatment of advanced heart failure will remain uncertain.", 
    "94": "Membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is proteolytically released in soluble form into the medium. We find that this release is stimulated up to 50-fold by phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate and also by the addition of fresh, serum-containing media. Concomitant with the enhanced release is a marked decrease in levels of membrane-bound ACE, down to 7% of resting levels in the case of phorbol ester stimulation. Staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, abolishes the phorbol ester effect. Kinetic analysis of the stimulated release rate indicates that it is first order, likely due to substrate depletion; calculated half times, t1/2, are 174 +/- 12 min and 40 +/- 6 min for the media-change and phorbol ester stimulated rates, respectively. Thus, release of membrane-bound ACE in CHO cells is regulated, in part, by a PKC-dependent mechanism.", 
    "95": "Significant improvements in the success of angioplasty combined with a major reduction in complications have led to widespread use of the technique in the treatment of symptomatic patients with coronary disease. Restenosis, however, remains the most significant limitation of angioplasty, occurring in 20-50% of patients following a successful procedure. Over the past 10 years, more than 40 large randomized pharmacological trials have attempted to address this problem. Currently no single agent has clearly been shown to reduce restenosis. As a consequence of intensive research, improved understanding of the pathophysiology of restenosis as well as the design of clinical studies necessary to study the process has resulted. Recent experimental studies suggest that vascular remodeling may be as important as intimal hyperplasia, and future trials will need to address this aspect of the restenosis process. Current approaches to preventing restenosis include the use of combined drug therapy to attack several pathophysiological processes, local delivery of drug at the site of the injury to maximize drug effect, and the use of highly specific drugs including local gene therapy.", 
    "96": "Left ventricular dilatation and neuroendocrine activation are common after acute anterior myocardial infarction. Long-term treatment with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may improve outcome by attenuating these processes. We investigated whether the ACE inhibitor zofenopril, administered for six weeks after anterior myocardial infarction, could improve both short-term and long-term outcome.", 
    "97": "A total of 1556 patients were enrolled within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute anterior myocardial infarction, and they were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either placebo (784 patients) or zofenopril (772 patients) for six weeks. At this time we assessed the incidence of death or severe congestive heart failure. The patients were reexamined after one year to assess survival.", 
    "98": "The incidence of death or severe congestive heart failure at six weeks was significantly reduced in the zofenopril group (55 patients, 7.1 percent), as compared with the placebo group (83 patients, 10.6 percent); the cumulative reduction in the risk of death or severe congestive heart failure was 34 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8 to 54 percent; P = 0.018). The reduction in risk was 46 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 11 to 71 percent; P = 0.018) for severe congestive heart failure and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -11 to 60 percent; P = 0.19) for death. After one year of observation, the mortality rate was significantly lower in the zofenopril group (10.0 percent) than in the placebo group (14.1 percent); the reduction in risk was 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 51 percent; P = 0.011).",

    "100": "We have previously shown that peripheral injection of bradykinin in combination with the kininase II inhibitor, captopril, to rats produces a robust water intake. We now extend this observation to another kininase II inhibitor, enalapril. Water intake increases with dose of dose of bradykinin, but has an inverted U-shaped relationship with dose of kininase II inhibitor. The induced water intake is completely blocked by peripheral administration of the bradykinin antagonist, Hoe 140, and is partly attenuated by peripheral injection of an angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonist, losartan. Relative to captopril alone, the combination of captopril and bradykinin greatly elevated plasma renin activity, but did not reduce blood pressure. We further show that, while either bradykinin or enalapril alone induce little or no Fos-like immunoreactivity in areas of the brain related to fluid balance, their combination induces staining in many cells in the supraoptic and paraventricular magnocellular nuclei, as well as along the lamina terminalis. These data suggest that bradykinin may have a role in regulation of fluid balance, partly mediated through Ang II.", 
    "101": "Of the many publications on quality of life in medicine over the last 2 decades, only a minor fraction have been devoted to drug trials. The most frequently investigated are classes of drugs within cancer disorders, hypertension and depressive illness. Health-related quality-of-life (QOL) measurements are typically applied in chronic or subchronic disorders where the balance between effectiveness (disease-modifying drug effects) and safety (adverse drug reactions) are assessed by patients in terms of subjective well-being. In this context, quality of life is an attempt to help the doctor to listen to his or her patient. The components of QOL measurements are to be found within the PCASEE model where: P = physical indicators; C = cognitive indicators; A = affective indicators; S = social indicators; E = economic-social stressors or negative life events; and E = ego function or personality problems. Most variance in QOL measurements arises through operating in the cognitive (e.g. lack of control, concentration difficulties) or affective (e.g. depressed mood or anxiety) components. The most specific component is, of course, adverse drug reactions, which are typically gastrointestinal symptoms in cancer therapies, and circulatory symptoms and sexual function with antihypertensive drugs. However, the affective and cognitive components also have different weights within subclasses of drugs, such as antihypertensive agents. Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors act on the affective component (depression and anxiety) and calcium channel blockers on the cognitive component (neurasthenia). In general, patients with cancer or hypertension give more reliable assessments of their cognitive and affective symptoms than their doctors do, while patients with primary depression are less reliable than their doctors or relatives in measuring changes in the affective components of their illness when they are ill. Health-related QOL measurements have not only an impact on the doctor-patient relationship but also involve a holistic approach to drug treatment, by checking all the PCASEE components.", 
    "102": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a disease of massive clinical and economic importance throughout the developed world. Approximately 1% of the population are affected, with incidence and prevalence of CHF increasing with age. The major aetiological factor is ischaemic heart disease and, despite advances in treatment, mortality from CHF remains appallingly high, and comparable to that of many malignancies. The majority of patients with CHF require treatment with a diuretic, though there is now clear evidence that the addition of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor will not only improve symptoms but also reduce mortality and delay the progression of the disease. The vast economic impact of CHF is now becoming fully appreciated, with the majority of expenditure on hospital admissions. The earlier and more widespread use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of CHF would be highly cost effective, with substantial savings in hospitalisation costs, though new and effective treatments are still urgently required.", 
    "103": "Cough is a frequent side-effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We examined the effects of inhaled sodium cromoglycate in 10 patients with ACE-inhibitor cough in a double-blind crossover study. After a 2-week run-in, patients were randomised to either 2 weeks' inhaled sodium cromoglycate or placebo followed by a further 2 weeks on the other treatment. Patients kept a cough diary during each study period. Cough severity was recorded on a scale from 0 to 12. At the end of each study period the cough threshold to inhaled capsaicin was measured. 9 patients reported a reduction in cough after sodium cromoglycate. Median (range) daily cough scores during run-in and placebo periods were 3.6 (1.9-6.4) and 4.1 (0.6-8.1), respectively (p > 0.05). Median daily cough score after sodium cromoglycate was 1.8 (0.4-3; p < 0.01). There was a significant relation between initial cough severity and benefit from sodium cromoglycate; and cough-reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin was significantly reduced. Inhaled sodium cromoglycate is an effective treatment for ACE-inhibitor cough. Its effect may be due to suppression of afferent vagal activity.", 
    "104": "We investigated the redistribution of myocardial isoenzymes of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) in rats with right heart failure induced by monocrotaline and assessed the effect of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (1) control (n = 20), (2) control + enalapril (25 mg/kg/day) (n = 22), (3) monocrotaline (50 mg/kg) (n = 45), (4) monocrotaline (50 mg/kg) + enalapril (25 mg/kg/day) (n = 32). After 4 weeks, the monocrotaline group developed severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy with marked decrease in myocardial norepinephrine and increase in both plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and mortality rate (33.3%). The marked decrease in both MM and mitochondrial CK ('creatine shuttle') and the relatively constant BB and MB CK caused the net depression of total CK. The depression of LD1 (aerobic LD) was remarkable compared with the relatively constant total LD. In the monocrotaline+enalapril group, mortality rate (9.4%), cardiac hypertrophy and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide were all significantly reduced and myocardial norepinephrine recovered although pulmonary hypertension was not improved at all. However, myocardial total, MM and mitochondrial CK and LD1 activities were all recovered completely or partially in this group. Thus, enalapril reduced cardiac hypertrophy and failure and improved the prognosis in this model of pulmonary hypertension. This beneficial effect of enalapril was not associated with pulmonary vasodepression but with the inhibition of myocardial isoenzyme redistribution of CK and LD, i.e. the preservation of 'creatine shuttle' and aerobic LD.", 
    "105": "Heart failure (HF) represents a major problem in Western countries due to its high prevalence, frequent need for hospitalization and extremely severe prognosis. There have been remarkable advances in long-term drug therapy. During the last decade, the use of vasodilatators, in particular of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, has been added to the traditional therapy based on diuretics and digitalis. There have been several controlled clinical trials demonstrating the long-term benefits of these drugs for survival. ACE-inhibitors have reduced the risk of mortality in HF, not only by their systemic vasodilatator action but also by their positive effects on ventricular remodelling. In fact, their use has led to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and progression of pump dysfunction. A reduction in the incidence of coronary events was also observed. ACE-inhibitors, in combination with diuretics and digitalis, have been rightfully introduced into long-term therapy of HF. At present, other pharmacological options, like flosequinan, some beta-blockers, and some calcium antagonists such as felodipine and amlodipine, hold promise, but further controlled trials are required before they can be introduced into the therapeutic repertoire of HF management.", 
    "106": "In most elderly patients, cardiac failure is associated with multiple cardiac pathologies, and the most common underlying abnormality is ventricular systolic dysfunction with reduced ejection fraction. In patients without cardiac enlargement, diastolic dysfunction may be predominant and left ventricular ejection fraction may be normal. Echocardiography is particularly suitable to evaluate changes in cardiovascular function that accompany age either as changes in disease patterns or as changes resulting simply from aging. The effects of digitalis on systolic and diastolic dysfunction are briefly reviewed, as well as the effects of diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and anticoagulant drugs.", 
    "107": "As a class of therapeutic agents, the ACE inhibitors have proven to have long-term mortality benefit when used after myocardial infarction and among patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Clinical trial data also indicate that the use of ACE inhibitors is associated with reduced rates of recurrent coronary thrombosis, an observation that raises the possibility that the renin-angiotensin system may be directly involved in the thrombotic process and that the ACE inhibitors may have valuable fibrinolytic and/or antithrombotic effects. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies of angiotensin II and its interactions with the fibrinolytic system, particularly with the primary inhibitor of intravascular fibrinolysis, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), provide substantial support for this hypothesis. In addition, a series of cross-sectional studies have described a genetic linkage between a common ACE gene polymorphism (DD) and the prevalence of clinical cardiovascular events, an intriguing finding as this polymorphism may account for much of the population variability in plasma ACE levels. Taken together, the totality of available clinical and experimental findings support the possibility of a direct linkage between the ACE system and vascular thrombosis that merits further prospective evaluation.", 
    "108": "1. In order to evaluate the therapeutic effects of antihypertensive agents on malignant hypertension in M-SHRSP, EEG were performed as a non-invasive, therapeutic index. 2. Under pentobarbital anaesthesia, the EEG pattern of rats with severe hypertension and/or cerebrovascular lesions showed alternate short-active and long-depressive phases with spike and sharp waves. 3. When M-SHRSP were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 29,852) or a calcium antagonist (manidipine), the depressive phases became shorter and active phases longer. These changes were more prominent in manidipine treated rats than in SQ 29,852 treated rats. 4. The EEG spike- and sharp-wave complex seems to be a convenient index for evaluating cerebrovascular lesions and cerebral activity in M-SHRSP.", 
    "109": "1. Cardiovascular and renal benefits of a specific angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, losartan (LOS), were assessed in diabetic rats with renal impairment. 2. Uninephrectomized SHR made diabetic by streptozotocin administration were given LOS (5 mg/kg per day, i.p.) alone, captopril (CAP) (50 mg/kg per day, i.p.) alone, or a combination of CAP and LOS via osmotic minipumps for 8 weeks. 3. Both CAP alone and LOS alone completely blocked the development of hypertension in diabetic SHR in the same manner. CAP + LOS did not enhance the antihypertensive effects of LOS alone or CAP alone. 4. CAP + LOS, LOS alone and CAP alone significantly decreased urinary protein excretion and serum creatinine to the same extent. 5. These results indicate that both LOS and CAP exert antihypertensive and renoprotective effects in this model: these actions are mainly through inhibition of AII production.", 
    "110": "1. In the present study, we examined the effect of a novel angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, TCV-116, on carotid neointimal formation after balloon injury in SHR and WKY rats. 2. Oral administration of TCV-116 at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day reduced not only systolic blood pressure but also neointimal formation after carotid balloon injury. TCV-116 also suppressed cardiac hypertrophy. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (20 mg/kg per day), had a similar effect to that of TCV-116. 3. In the WKY experiment, both TCV-116 and lisinopril suppressed neointimal formation as well as systolic blood pressure, but did not suppress cardiac hypertrophy. 4. Although SHR showed markedly enhanced neointimal formation after balloon injury compared with age-matched WKY rat, both TCV-116 and lisinopril showed similar suppressive effects on neointimal formation in both SHR and WKY rats. 5. These results confirm the important role of angiotensin II in neointimal formation following balloon injury. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of the difference between SHR and WKY rats in the response of vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "111": "1. We assessed the potential of the kallikrein-kinin system in mediating the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), cilazapril (CIL) in rats with renal ablation. 2. Eight week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy. One week after the operation, the rats were divided into 5 groups: (i) vehicle; (ii) CIL 1 mg/kg per day per os (p.o.); (iii) Hoe140 (HOE) 70 mu g/kg per day given intraperitoneally (i.p.); (iv) CIL 1 mg/kg per day p.o. plus HOE 7 mu g/kg per day i.p.; (v) CIL 1 mg/kg per day p.o. plus HOE 70 mu g/kg per day i.p. The treatment lasted for 4 weeks. 3. CIL alone significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, heart weight and serum creatinine level. HOE alone did not induce any significant changes in these parameters. CIL in combination with HOE (7 or 70 mu g/kg per day) did not induce any changes in these parameters, in addition to those associated with the effects of CIL alone. 4. These results indicate that the kallikrein-kinin system might not play a major role in the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors in the rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure.", 
    "112": "1. We investigated the protective effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and a Ca antagonist on vascular injury in hypertension. 2. Thirteen week old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were orally given cilazapril (ACEI 10 mg per kg day) or nifedipine (Ca antagonist 30 mg kg per day) for 12 weeks. After the treatment, the aorta and superior mesenteric artery were excised, and subjected to the extraction of RNA. mRNA levels for the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin (FN), collagen type I (CoI), type III (CoIII) and type IV (CoIV) and laminin, were measured by northern blot analysis, using each specific cDNA probe. 3. In the mesenteric artery of SHRSP, TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were increased compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, being accompanied by a significant increase in mRNA levels for FN, CoI, CoIII, CoIV and laminin. In the aorta, only TGF-beta1 and fibronectin mRNAs were increased in SHRSP, but collagen and laminin were not increased. 4. Both cilazapril and nifedipine, to similar extents, suppressed the above mentioned increased gene expressions in both mesenteric artery and aorta, being associated with the improvement of vascular hypertrophy. 5. These results suggest that TGF-beta1 may be responsible for smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and the increased deposition of extracellular matrix in hypertensive blood vessels. Both cilazapril and nifedipine may lessen hypertensive vascular thickening, by suppressing the gene expression of TGF-beta1 and extracellular matrix.", 
    "113": "1. The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on blood pressure and spontaneous blood glucose levels in two rat models: our new diabetic hypertensive rat in which genetic hypertension and diabetes develop following cross-breeding of Cohen diabetic rat (CDR) and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR); and a rat in which hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia were induced by fructose diet. 2. The new strain of animal was fed the usual copper-poor sucrose diet, and for 4 weeks received enalapril. The fructose-induced hyperinsulinaemic animals were fed a fructose-enriched diet for 3 weeks, and enalapril 20 mg per kg per day was added to the drinking water for 2 more weeks. 3. The new strain of diabetic-hypertensive rats that received enalapril showed a significant decrease in blood pressure level. The fructose-fed animals showed a fall in insulin and blood pressure following the introduction of enalapril to their diet. 4. The present study confirms the advantage of the ACE inhibitor enalapril in improving the metabolic parameters of hypertensive diabetic rats, including insulin sensitivity.", 
    "114": "1. New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rats were treated with enalapril (20 mg/kg per day in drinking fluids) from age 4-10 weeks; one group (GHex-enal) was then taken off enalapril and followed for 6 more weeks to see if the drug-induced changes in blood pressure (BP) and structure of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) were long lasting once the enalapril was withdrawn. Control groups consisted of untreated GH and their normotensive (N) control strain. 2. Tail-cuff BP in GH treated rats fell significantly to N BP levels during treatment. On cessation of treatment BP rose rapidly. At age 16 weeks BP, although at a hypertensive level (mean +/- s.e.m., GHex-enal, 210.8 +/- 4.7 mmHg), was still significantly below the GH controls (230 +/- 6.9, P < 0.05), but above the N control group (137 +/- 3, P < 0.001). 3. Left ventricular (LV) mass in GH rats was reduced by enalapril to that in N rats; at the end of the subsequent period without treatment it was still significantly lower than the GH control group, but also significantly above the N group (GHex-enal, 255 +/- 6; GH 306 +/- 11; N 179 +/- 3, mg/100 g bodyweight). 4. The large changes in media, lumen and media/lumen ratio seen after 6 weeks of treatment were not sustained over the subsequent non-treatment period. However, values in the GHex-enal group at 16 weeks were closer to those in the N16 control group. 5. The persisting effects on smooth muscle (SM) cell density and SM fraction of the media contributed to an increase in SM cell volume which was significantly greater than the N16 group (P < 0.01). The number of layers of SM in the media was less than in the GH16 control group and not different from the N16 controls. 6. In GH rats the effect of ACEI on PB, LV mass and MRA structure is relatively longlasting once treatment is withdrawn.", 
    "115": "1. The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril was studied on fructose-induced hypertensive and hyperinsulinaemic rats. 2. 60 Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a fructose-enriched diet for 5 weeks, which produced hyperinsulinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypertension. Beginning with week 3 of the diet, lisinopril (10 and 20 mg per kg per day), ramipril (5 and 10 mg/kg per day) and enalapril (20 mg/kg per day) were given daily in drinking water for 2 weeks to 10 rats in each drug group. Ten rats fed only the fructose-enriched diet served as control. 3. Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly by the indirect tail-cuff method. Plasma insulin level was determined using RIA. 4. Data indicate that ACEI improve insulin resistance induced by high-fructose intake in rats; that despite their equal hypotensive effect, ACEI differ in their ability to improve insulin resistance; and that improvement of insulin resistance by ACEI is dose-dependent.", 
    "116": "1. We examined the effect of three doses (0.03, 0.3 and 3 mg/kg per day) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril, on the long-term blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of the Okamoto strain after treatment during the developmental stage of hypertension development. 2. While the 0.03 mg/kg per day dose, given between the ages of 4-10 weeks of age, failed to lower blood pressure, the two higher doses resulted in normotension over this treatment period as did the highest dose given between the ages of 4-20 weeks of age. 3. Only the 0.3 mg/kg per day dose resulted in a moderate (17%) long-term fall in blood pressure upon cessation of treatment when compared to untreated SHR controls. The highest dose, given over the 4-20 week period resulted in a significant rebound hypertension above the blood pressure level of untreated, control SHR. 4. The 3 mg/kg per day dose, whether given over the 4-10 or 4-20 week treatment period, resulted in 100% mortality in these groups by 52 weeks of age. There were no deaths in the groups receiving the two lower doses. 5. We conclude that treatment of SHR with perindopril during the developmental phase of hypertension development results in only a modest fall in long-term blood pressure upon cessation of treatment and that the relationship between the dose of this ACE inhibitor and long-term blood pressure is not linear. The 100% mortality in the two groups receiving the highest dose of perindopril may be due to either a toxic action of this drug or vascular rupture due to insufficient hypertrophy for the rapid rise in blood pressure upon cessation of treatment.", 
    "117": "1. Our results indicate that the drugs used in this study are very effective in malignant hypertension therapy. 2. For M-SHRSP treated with highly effective antihypertensive drugs, if blood pressure remains under 200 mmHg over the long-term, the structures of the small arteries and/or arterioles stay as well preserved as they do in WKY. 3. For M-SHRSP treated with drugs with a lower antihypertensive effect, the occurrence of cerebrovascular lesions and angionecrosis in the various organs are suppressed significantly, even though blood pressure remains over 250 mmHg over the long-term. Based upon effect alone, there is no difference between ACEI and a calcium antagonist. However, inhibition of the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells is more potent in the former than in the latter. 4. These results suggest that ACEI might have the potential to suppress smooth muscle cell proliferation independent of high blood pressure.", 
    "118": "1. The thermolysin digest of dried bonito, Katsuo-bushi, showed inhibitory activity (IC50 = 29 mu g/mL) for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and an antihypertensive effect after a single oral administration in SHR at a dose of 500 mg/kg. In a long-term feeding experiment, in which 3 week old SHR were fed a standard chow supplemented with the digest for 7 weeks, elevation of the systolic blood pressure was significantly suppressed by 15 mg/kg per day of the digest. 2. A digest of dried bonito by gastrointestinal proteases (pepsin-trypsin-chymotrypsin) failed to lower the blood pressure after a single oral administration (1000 mg/kg) in spite of a fairly strong ACEI activity (IC50 = 41 mu g/mL). 3. The ACEI activity of the thermolysin digest did not change after preincubation with gastrointestinal proteases or ACE. However, that of the pepsin-trypsin-chymotrypsin digest was reduced after the preincubation with ACE suggesting that the apparent inhibitory activity was due to ACE substrate peptides. 4. Eight ACEI peptides were isolated from the thermolysin digest. Most of them were true inhibitors or precursors that are converted into true inhibitors by ACE or gastrointestinal proteases in vivo. The precursor type peptides required a longer time than true inhibitors to show maximal antihypertensive effect after a single oral administration in SHR. Thus, the thermolysin digest of dried bonito is a mixture of a true inhibitor and precursor peptides differing from each other in maximally effective times.", 
    "119": "1. The mechanisms whereby angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reverse cardiac remodelling appear to involve angiotensin and/or bradykinin receptors. Previously we reported that cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts express angiotensin II (AII) receptors. In the present study we compared AII receptor binding, gene expression of angiotensinogen and the AII, Subtype 1A (AT1A) receptor, as well as morphological changes induced by selected hormonal treatments in cultured fibroblasts derived from SHRLJ or WKYLJ rats. 2. Fibroblasts were isolated from adult rat left ventricle by either collagenase B or collagenase P digestion. Collagenase B yielded cell preparations from SHRLJ which grew slower than cells from WKYLJ rats and expressed nearly two-fold fewer AII receptors (compared to WKYLJ) while collagenase P yielded SHRLJ cells with similar binding and growth properties to WKYLJ. A good correlation was observed between receptor binding and AII receptor, type 1A (AT1A) mRNA concentrations. In the presence of steroids collagenase B cells showed a higher tendency to transform towards a preadipocyte cell type, estimated by the formation of lipid containing vacuoles/cell, while collagenase P cells, mainly the SHRLJ type, start to differentiate toward a myofibroblast-like cell type in the presence of AII, as calculated by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin. 3. From the results obtained in this study it is evident that a subset of fibroblasts can be isolated from the SHRLJ heart using collagenase B or P which differ in growth rates, AII receptor binding, AT1A and angiotensinogen mRNA levels, morphology and steroid responsiveness when compared to fibroblasts isolated from cardiac WKYLJ tissue.", 
    "120": "1. Recent evidence indicates that cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload is associated with a decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ -ATPase of myocytes, which may contribute to a diastolic dysfunction of the heart by causing intracellular Ca2+ overload. To elucidate whether or not this is also the case in genetic hypertension, we examined cardiac mRNA levels of SR Ca2+ ATPase in 11 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by northern blot analysis. 2. Furthermore, to test the effects of short-term inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system on its expression, we treated 10 week old SHR with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (alacepril and imidapril) or an AT1 receptor antagonist (SC-52458) for 7 days. 3. Though the left ventricular weight of SHR was significantly higher than that of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (277 +/- 6 vs 237 +/- 4 mg/100 g bodyweight, respectively, P < 0.05), the level of SR Ca2+ -ATPase mRNA showed no difference between SHR and WKY at this age. 4. Moreover, the aforementioned three drugs did not at all affect the SR Ca2+ -ATPase expression of SHR. 5. Thus, the expression of SR Ca2+ -ATPase was not down-regulated in the heart of 11 week old SHR, and seemed not to be mediated by angiotensin AT1 receptor at this age. Since some evidence on pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy indicate that the decrease in SR Ca2+ -ATPase expression occur in prominent hypertrophy and in the failured heart, further studies on cardiac SR Ca2+ -ATPase expression in more aged SHR will be required.", 
    "121": "1. Malignant or precocious stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (M-SHRSP) showed hypertensive ocular fundus changes with severe hypertension, but various anti-hypertensive drugs given over a proper period improved funduscopic findings. 2. We treated a M-SHRSP with SQ29,852 (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ACEI) or manidipine (a calcium antagonist) and observed hypertensive vascular changes in the fundus. 3. The M-SHRSP treated with anti-hypertensive drugs lived longer and the hypertensive fundic changes improved in both groups. But there were some differences of histochemical staining reaction on the endothelial cell-surface and mucopolysaccharides accumulations between the treated group of ACEI and the group treated with the calcium antagonist. 4. In the treated group with calcium antagonist, the anionic ion functions of the endothelial cell-surface were impaired and organic retinal or choroidal damages appeared to have deteriorated.", 
    "122": "1. Before the onset of hypertension low frequency (0.04-0.1 Hz) MAP fluctuations are reduced in SHR when compared to WKY. We studied the effect of haemorrhage under alpha1 blockade or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) on the power spectra (PS) of each strain. 2. MAP was recorded from the caudal artery in conscious, 1 month old SHR and WKY. Three groups of rats were studied. Group 1, acute 2 mL haemorrhage; groups 2 and 3, injection of prazosin (0.25-2.5 mg/kg) or captopril (0.5-4 mg/kg), followed by haemorrhage, as in group 1. The PS was divided into 3 frequency bands, 0.004-0.04, 0.04-0.07 and 0.07-0.1 Hz. 3. In SHR, although the baseline MAP levels were similar to those of WKY, the PS was significantly damped in each of the 3 frequency bands. 4. Haemorrhage induced a similar MAP fall in both strains accompanied by an increase in the slow MAP fluctuations. However, in SHR the PS response was significantly greater than in WKY. The biggest response was in the slowest (0.004-0.04 Hz) frequency band, 8.7 +/- 1.7 vs 1.5 +/- 0.4 times baseline levels, respectively. 5. The difference between the two strains in the PS response to haemorrhage was eliminated by alpha1 blockade. The exaggerated response observed in haemorrhaged, unblocked SHR was reduced in the 3 frequency bands. 6. Captopril reduced the PS response to haemorrhage in SHR to the level observed in WKY in all 3 frequency bands. 7. The enhanced amplification of the MAP fluctuations in haemorrhaged SHR may indicate that SHR requires greater recruitment of control mechanisms than WKY to maintain MAP at a similar level to WKY.", 
    "123": "First-generation calcium antagonists have been used in patients with congestive heart failure with rather disappointing results. Therefore, second-generation dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, such as felodipine and lacidipine, have been developed that may be beneficial in congestive heart failure owing to their high vasoselectivity and more favorable neurohumoral modulation. The effects of lacidipine in patients with congestive heart failure, who remain symptomatic despite receiving long-term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, were investigated during a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Twenty-five patients were randomized to receive either lacidipine (4 mg once daily; 12 patients) or placebo (once daily; 13 patients). After 8 weeks of treatment patients receiving lacidipine showed a significantly higher increase in cardiac output (p < 0.01), and a significantly greater reduction in vascular resistance (p < 0.02) than those patients in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in filling pressures and heart rate. The arteriovenous oxygen content difference was significantly reduced in the lacidipine group (p < 0.01) without significant changes in arterial oxygenation, suggesting an increase in flow that was not a result of pulmonary shunting. Further peak oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing increased significantly in the lacidipine patients (p < 0.02). These beneficial effects were achieved without significant changes in neurohumoral parameters. Analysis of right and left ventricular ejection fractions revealed no cardiodepressant effects. Lacidipine was well tolerated during the course of the study, and adverse reactions were minor. These data suggest that lacidipine has a promising profile for the treatment of congestive heart failure patients, and that further investigation with second-generation dihydropyridines in the field of congestive heart failure appears warranted.", 
    "124": "Increase in lipid peroxidation (LP) is an indirect marker of free radical activation. The products of LP (malonyldialdehyde: MDA) are increased in diabetic patients, particularly those with angiopathy. Free radicals are eliminated by cellular enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In this study, the effect and the mechanism of action of captopril, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes from diabetics was investigated. LP and glutathione were studied in 10 type II diabetics (mean age: 57 +/- 10 yr, duration of diabetes: 12 +/- 6 yr) and in 10 healthy subjects (mean age: 30 +/- 5 yr). Lipid peroxidation levels were 20.69 +/- 4.68 MDA% in diabetics and 9.62 +/- 1.87 MDA% in normal subjects. The LP in erythrocytes of type II diabetics was decreased by the increasing concentrations of captopril (before captopril: 20.69 +/- 4.68, after captopril: (2 x 10(-5) M) 16.68 +/- 7.49 MDA%; (4 x 10(-5) M) 14.17 +/- 7.65 MDA%; (6 x 10(-5) M) 12.33 +/- 2.8 MDA%). No difference was found in the inhibition of LP between the captopril concentrations of 6 x 10(-5) M and 10 x 10(-5) M. After preincubation with captopril, the glutathione level did not change significantly in the diabetic and normal erythrocytes. Preincubation with 2-6 x 10(-5) M captopril showed no effect in the normal group (p > 0.05) but 10 x 10(-5) M captopril reduced lipid peroxidation (p < 0.01). In our study, the high levels of lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes from diabetic patients were decreased after preincubation with captopril. Decrease in the level of lipid peroxidation in vitro was independent of the glutathione level. Crosslink binding between MDA and captopril is suggested.", 
    "125": "A double blind placebo-controlled trial was performed to evaluate antihypertension efficacy and tolerance of a new inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme benazepril (a single daily dose 10-20 mg) versus captopril (50 mg 1-2 times daily) in 30 patients with mild and moderate hypertension. Monotherapy with benazepril continued 8 weeks. Antihypertension efficacy of benazepril made up 71%, of captopril 64%. Side effects occurred in 2 patients on benazepril and 1 on captopril. These two drugs produced no negative effects on renal function, electrolyte and lipid metabolism, but induced glucose lowering. Thus, benazepril single daily administration in patients with mild and moderate hypertension is effective and is tolerated well.", 
    "126": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian central nervous system. Like other neuropeptides, NPY is inactivated by specialized neuropeptidases. To trace the degradation of NPY, an assay was established using biotinylated NPY. Biotinyl-NPY was radiolabeled with Na125l by the chloramine-T method and bound to a streptavidin-agarose matrix. The amount of radiolabeling was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. The assay was carried out with five peptidases and inhibitors to demonstrate different specific activity. Measurable amounts of radioactivity were released by treatment with endopeptidase-24.18, plasmin, and trypsin, whereas dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) showed no activity in this assay. In the case of DPPIV this is due to a resistance of the assay to aminopeptidase attack. The assay is useful to study the specific degradation of NPY particularly by endopeptidases in all kinds of biological samples.", 
    "127": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled multicentre study with spirapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), has been conducted in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) of NYHA classes II-IV. After a placebo run-in period of 1-4 weeks, patients were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups: placebo (n = 48), spirapril 1.5 mg (n = 48), spirapril 3 mg (n = 53), spirapril 6 mg (n = 51) or enalapril 5/10 mg (n = 48). The primary objective was to assess changes in exercise tolerance, and the secondary objective was an assessment of cardiovascular signs and symptoms, quality of life, ejection fraction and chest X-ray findings. Exercise tolerance increased in all groups; however, no statistically significant differences were found between any of the groups. There was a statistically significant reduction of mortality in the pooled spirapril groups compared with placebo, and a trend for reduction of serious cardiovascular adverse events as well as duration of hospitalization. These effects and improvements in lung congestion appeared to be dose dependent. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the combination with first-generation calcium channel blockers had an unfavourable effect on exercise capacity and clinical parameters. Spirapril might be an effective alternative to enalapril in the treatment of patients with CHF. The role of the exercise tolerance test in establishing efficacy of ACEIs in CHF and the widespread use of nifedipine in CHF is questioned.", 
    "128": "A prospective observational cohort study of the angiotensin inhibitor, ramipril, was undertaken in four countries within the European Community-Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium. A total of 10,377 consecutive patients with essential hypertension were recruited to the study with the aim of follow-up for one year. Overall 37% of doctors who agreed to participate in the study actually enrolled at least one patient. One third of the doctors who enrolled patients in the study entered two thirds of patients studied. Some 15% of participating males and 27% of females were aged over 70 years. Newly diagnosed hypertensives comprised 22% of the study cohort, the proportion being highest in UK and Netherlands, whereas 53% were established hypertensives of two or more years' duration, the proportion being highest in Germany and Belgium. There were substantial differences among the participating countries in the concurrent treatment these patients were receiving for hypertension, with two or more co-therapies being most frequent in Germany and Belgium. There were also substantial differences in co-therapies for concurrent diseases among the participating countries, reflecting both standard therapeutic practices in local areas and differences in marketing of drugs in the different countries. This report describes the initial findings of this multinational study and emphasises the need to consider several major potentially confounding variables in the analysis of the outcome events both in this study and in other collaborative observational international monitoring schemes for adverse drug reactions.", 
    "129": "To investigate the effects of antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril on insulin sensitivity and related metabolic variables, the insulin sensitivity index (SI), determined with the Minimal Model Method of Bergman, fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, serum total triglyceride and lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, and blood pressure were assessed in 24 lean, non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension. Following a double-blind, randomised crossover design, these parameters were measured after a 4-week run-in period, after 8 weeks of lisinopril or placebo, and after an additional 8 weeks on placebo or lisinopril, respectively. Furthermore, the level of physical fitness was estimated using the Conconi bicycle ergometer test. SI was low in this study population (5.6 vs 13.3 x 10(-4).min-1.mU-1.l-1 in normal lean control subjects). It did not differ between the placebo run-in phase, the lisinopril phase, and the placebo crossover phase (5.8, 5.5, and 5.4 x 10(-4).min-1.mU-1.l-1, respectively). Moreover, during the administration of lisinopril, no significant changes occurred in fasting plasma insulin and glucose, areas under the glucose and insulin curves, glucose disappearance rate, serum total triglycerides, and cholesterol or lipoprotein cholesterol fractions. Heart rate at rest, body weight, and anaerobic threshold remained stable throughout the study. Compliance assessed by pill-counting exceeded 90% at all visits. These findings demonstrate that the ACE inhibitor lisinopril is neutral with regard to insulin sensitivity, plasma insulin and glucose, and lipoprotein metabolism in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "130": "This study examined the effects of lisinopril on diastolic function in 12 normotensive patients (mean age 72 years) with symptomatic congestive heart failure, intact left ventricular systolic function and abnormal diastolic function secondary to ischaemic heart disease in a placebo-controlled double blind crossover study, with each treatment dosed orally for 5 continuous weeks. Compared to placebo, lisinopril significantly decreased blood pressure, increased plasma renin activity without altering heart rate or plasma norepinephrine. There was no statistically significant improvement with lisinopril in radionuclide derived peak filling rate and time to peak filling rate, in Doppler echocardiographic measurements of the ratio of peak flow velocity in early diastole to the peak flow velocity of atrial contraction (E:A ratio) and in visual analogue scales of symptoms. Thus, although angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors may have an established role in the treatment of heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, its use in patients with isolated diastolic dysfunction remains unclear.", 
    "131": "Angiotensin (ANG) and kinin metabolizing enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1), neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (NEP-24.11; EC 3.4.24.11), and aminopeptidase M (AmM; EC 3.4.11.2), have recently been identified in a purified skeletal muscle glycoprotein fraction. We have analyzed the cellular localization of these enzymes. In cultured human skeletal muscle adult myoblasts, myotubes, and fibroblasts, kinins and angiotensins were metabolized by NEP-24.11 and AmM but not by ACE. NEP-24.11 degraded ANG II, ANG III. and bradykinin (BK) and converted ANG I to the active metabolite ANG(1-7). ANG III was converted to the novel ANG IV metabolite [des-Arg1]ANG III by AmM. These data suggest that, due to their abundance in the body, skeletal muscle myocytes and fibroblasts may play a major role in modulation of the systemic and local effects of angiotensins and kinins. This role could be particularly important in individuals receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "132": "A nontoxic peptide with bradykinin-potentiating activity was isolated from the dialyzed venom of the scorpion Buthus occitanus by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The pharmacological activity of the peptide was bioassayed by its ability to potentiate added bradykinin (BK) on the isolated guinea pig ileum as well as the isolated rat uterus for contraction. Moreover, the peptide potentiates in vivo the depressor effect of BK on arterial blood pressure in the normotensive anesthetized rat. Chemical characterization of the peptide was also performed. The amino acid composition of the peptide showed 21 amino acid residues per molecule including three proline residues. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Either N- or C-terminal ends were free. The sequence does not show a homology with bradykinin-potentiating peptides isolated from either scorpion or snake venoms. Furthermore, we did not find a significant sequence homology between the sequence of the isolated peptide and any of proteins or peptides in GenPro or NBRF data banks. The peptide also inhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and could not serve as substrate for the enzyme. It could be concluded that the mechanism of bradykinin-potentiating peptide (BPP) activity may be due to ACE inhibition.", 
    "133": "We have assessed the effect of thiorphan or captopril on proliferation of two human tumor cell lines, A549 and HL60 including their influence on the cytostatic activity of interferon alpha or doxorubicin. The results showed that captopril inhibits the proliferation of both A549 and HL60 cells lines but thiorphan has antiproliferative effect only on A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, neither captopril nor thiorphan administered in combination with interferon alpha or doxorubicin enhanced cytotoxic potential of doxorubicin and cytostatic activity of interferon alpha.",

The results showed that after administration of CP, the contents of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and cAMP and PA activity were significantly higher, PAI activity were remarkably lower than those of control group. These effects were dose-dependent. Our finding indicated that CP might act as a prospective drug for antithrombosis through promoting anticoagulation and fibrinolysis function and increasing antithrombus action of EC.", 
    "135": "Using whole-cell patch-clamp technique, the present study examined the effects of captopril on membrane currents of ventricular myocytes. The results were as follow: when the concentration of captopril was 6 x 10(-4)mol, the fast inward sodium current and slow inward calcium current were all decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Besides, when the concentration exceeds 10(-3)mol, the delayed rectifier potassium current was increased (P < 0.05) as well. But if the experimental concentration was under 6 x 10(-4)mol, these three kinds of currents was not affected. These findings suggested that captopril has no direct antiarrhythmic effect at the average therapeutic serum level.", 
    "136": "Inactivation of lipoamide dehydrogenase (LipDH) by the Cu(II)/H2O2 Fenton system (SF-Cu(II): (5.0 microM Cu(II), 3.0 mM H2O2) was enhanced by catecholamines (CAs), namely, epinephrine, levoDOPA (DOPA), DOPAMINE, 6-hydroxyDOPAMINE (OH-DOPAMINE) and related compounds (DOPAC, CATECHOL, etc.). After 5 min incubation with the Cu(II)/H2O2/CA system (0.4 mM CA), the enzyme activity decayed as indicated by the following percentage values (mean +/- S.D.; in parenthesis, number of determinations): SF-Cu(II) alone, 43 +/- 10 (18); SF-Cu(II) + epinephrine, 80 +/- 9 (5); SF-Cu(II) + DOPA, 78 +/- 2 (4); SF + Cu(II) + DOPAMINE, 88 +/- 7 (5); SF-Cu(II) + OH-DOPAMINE 87 +/- 6 (7); SF-Cu(II) +/- DOPAC, 88 +/- 3 (6); SF-Cu(II) + catechol, 85 +/- 6 (5). In all cases P < 0.05, with respect to the SF-Cu(II) control sample. CAs effect was concentration-dependent and at the 0-100 microM concentration range, it varied with the CA structure. Above the 100 microM concentration, CAs were equally effective and produced 90-100% enzyme, inactivation (Figure 2). In the absence of oxy-radical generation, the enzyme specific activity (mean +/- S.D.) was 149 +/- 10 (24) mumol NADH/min/mg protein. Assay of HO. production by the Cu(II)/H2O2/CA system in the presence of deoxyribose (TBA assay) yielded values much greater than those obtained omitting CA. Hydroxyl radical production depended on the presence of Cu(II) and H2O2 and significant H. values were obtained with OH-DOPAMINE, DOPAC, epinephrine, DOPAMINE, DOPA and catecol supplemented systems (Table 2). LipDH (1.0 microM) inhibited 50-80% deoxyribose oxidation, the inhibition depending on the CA structure (Table 2). Native catalase (20 micrograms/ml) and bovine serum albumin (40 micrograms/ml) effectively prevented LipDH inactivation by the Cu(II)/H2O2/CA system; denaturated catalase, SOD, 0.3 M mannitol, 6.0 mM ethanol and 0.2 M benzoate were less effective or did not protect LipDH (Table 3). Incubation of CAs with the Cu(II)/H2O2 system produced a time and Cu(II)-dependent destruction of CAs, the corresponding o-quinone, production as illustrated with epinephrine (figures 6 and 7), as illustrated with epinephrine and DOPAMINE (Table 4). These results support LipDH inactivation by (a) reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by CAs followed by Cu-catalyzed production of HO. from H2O2; (b) CA oxidation followed by the corresponding o-quinone interaction with LipDH. CAPTOPRIL, N-acetylcysteine, mercaptopropionylglycine and penicillamine prevented to various degree LipDH inactivation by the Cu(II)/H2O2/CA systems (Table 1). The former was the most effective and 0.4 mM CAPTOPRIL prevented about 95-100% the effect of Cu(II)/H2O2/CA systems supplemented with epinephrine, DOPAMINE and OH-DOPAMINE (Figures 3 and Table 1). LipDH increased and CAPTOPRIL inhibited epinephrine oxidation by Cu(II)/H2O2 (Figures 4 and 5). Since un-physiological concentrations of CAs and Cu(II) may be released in the myocardium after ischemia-reperfusion, the summarized observations may contribute to explain myocardial damage in that condition.", 
    "137": "Phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA) is commonly used to produce experimental edema and other tissue injuries in the lung. Lung injuries induced by the administration of PMA has been shown to be mediated mainly by neutrophils. Neutrophils recruited to the lower respiratory tract may damage lung tissues by releasing reactive oxygen species, neutral proteases, and lysosomal enzymes. The present study was conducted to investigate whether alpha-tocopherol, entrapped in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes and delivered directly to the lung, could counteract some of the PMA-induced lung injuries. Plain liposomes or alpha-tocopherol containing liposomes (8 mg alpha-tocopherol/kg body weight) were intratracheally instilled into the lungs of rats 24 hr prior to PMA exposure (25 micrograms/kg) and treated rats were killed 3 hr later. Lungs of control animals exposed to PMA developed an increase in lung weight and lipid peroxidation as well as a decrease in lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities. PMA treatment also caused an increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung, suggestive of neutrophil infiltration. Pretreatment of PMA-treated rats with plain liposomes had no effect on PMA-induced injuries. In contrast, pretreatment of rats with liposomal alpha-tocopherol, 24 hr prior to PMA administration, resulted in a significant elevation of pulmonary alpha-tocopherol concentration, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in MPO activity and reversal of PMA-induced changes in lung edema, lipid peroxidation, ACE and AKP activities. These results appear to demonstrate that the intratracheal administration of a liposome-associated lipophilic antioxidant, such as alpha-tocopherol, can significantly ameliorate the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species, putatively released from PMA-stimulated pulmonary target cells and infiltrating neutrophils.", 
    "138": "The development of highly sensitive and specific immunoassays allowed the characterization of bradykinin and desArg9-BK metabolism in vitro.

    "139": "Many individuals possess an allele of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, which contains an extra 287-kb fragment in intron 16 (Rigat et al. 1992). Although the functionality of this fragment is at present unclear, the absence (deletion, D) or presence (insertion, I) of this fragment appears to be related to both the amount and activity of circulating ACE. This paper reports the possible polymorphic response of ACE to the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat in 54 normal Chinese subjects that is independent of the I/D polymorphism. The kinetics of ACE inhibition with enalaprilat was studied in serum from 54 normal Chinese subjects. Enalaprilat appKi ranged between 0.46 and 2.16 nM. An antimode was observed at 1.4 nM. Four subjects could be characterized as being poor responders to enalaprilat.",

Physical examination of the patient, non-invasive tests and invasive tests have to be done to exclude secondary dilated cardiomyopathies. Treatment can be divided into baseline therapy, established treatment, e.g. ACE-inhibitors, digitalis and diuretics and optional treatment including betablocker, anticoagulation and an natural course of IDC for an individual patient is not clear although there are several prognostic parameters for this disease.", 
    "141": "In hypertensive patients with lipid abnormalities, an ideal antihypertensive agent would control blood pressure without interfering with lipid metabolism. The aim of the present study was to assess whether in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and alpha 1-antagonists, rilmenidine (RIL), the first antihypertensive drug that is selective to imidazoline receptors, fulfills these requirements. To assess the effects of RIL (daily doses of 1 mg o.d. or b.i.d.) in comparison to captopril (CAP) (doses of 25 or 50 mg b.i.d.), an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study was carried out. Fifty-one patients (mean age: 56.3 +/- 1.5 years) with mild-to-moderate hypertension (supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 165.1 +/- 2.0/99.1 +/- 0.6 mm Hg) and type 2a or 2b hyperlipidemia (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 5.38 +/- 0.16 mmol/L) were included in the study, and they were followed by their general practitioner at 4-week intervals. Twenty-six patients received RIL, and 25 received CAP. The permanence of hypercholesterolemia was checked twice before inclusion into the study, at 3-week intervals, for patients who had already been on a hypocholesterolemic diet for 6 weeks. Plasma lipid evaluation included total, LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A1 and B, lipoprotein (a), and, last, a uric acid assay. Assays were centralized at the Lipid Laboratory, CHU Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00e9tri\u00e8re, Paris. In each group, 1 patient withdrew from the study for personal reasons, and four patients required a dose adjustment (double dose) at the week 4 visit. After 8 weeks of therapy, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, with no statistically significant difference between groups (RIL, 20.5 mm Hg; CAP, 21.3 mm Hg; NS). Diastolic blood pressure also decreased (RIL, 13.9 mm Hg; CAP, 15.1 mm Hg; NS). No difference between groups was observed on the changes of lipid parameters between week 0 and week 8 visits. No severe adverse event occurred other than an asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in a CAP group patient at week 8. This study provides evidence that over a follow-up period of 8 weeks, both RIL and CAP are efficient and well-tolerated drugs in the first-line treatment of hypertensive patients with lipid abnormalities.", 
    "142": "It is generally accepted that the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a multifactorial phenomenon that also involves neurohormonal mechanisms. This finding may account for the ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to induce faster and more complete reversal of LVH than that observed with other antihypertensive treatments. The sympathetic system is also involved in the genesis of hypertension-induced LVH. We assessed the effects of satisfactory long-term treatment with rilmenidine, a new oxazoline with a potent antihypertensive action, on cardiovascular structural abnormalities and cardiac endocrine function in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Eleven patients underwent M-mode and two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, peripheral pulsed Doppler flowmetry, determination of plasma atrial natriuretic factor [(ANF) pg/ml] and renin activity, and 24-h urine electrolyte excretion under control conditions, after 4 weeks of blood pressure normalization, after 1 year of satisfactory antihypertensive treatment and, finally, 4 weeks after therapy withdrawal. I.VH (g/m2 body surface area) was reversed after 1-year treatment (from 152 +/- 5 to 131 +/- 4, p < 0.05). One-year treatment induced an improvement in brachial artery compliance (cm4/dyne.10(7)) (from 0.92 +/- 0.06 to 1.16 +/- 0.08, p < 0.05) that persisted after withdrawal of treatment (1.17 +/- 0.06, p < 0.05). Plasma renin activity and urinary electrolyte excretion did not change throughout the study, whereas ANF remained unchanged after blood pressure normalization (48.4 +/- 6.2 versus 44.7 +/- 2.9, NS), fell after reversal of LVH (28.6 +/- 3.4, p < 0.05), and remained significantly lower than under control conditions after therapy withdrawal (27.5 +/- 2.9, p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that a satisfactory long-term antihypertensive treatment with rilmenidine is able to reverse cardiovascular structural changes and to restore cardiac endocrine function.", 
    "143": "The effect of pH on the buccal and sublingual absorption of captopril was evaluated using in vitro techniques and human studies. Partitioning of captopril into n-octanol was lowest over the pH range 5 to 8 and highest at pH values 3, 4 and 9. Using the buccal absorption technique, the partitioning of captopril (2 mg) was examined in six healthy male volunteers from buffered solutions (pH 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Lowest buccal partitioning occurred at pH 3 while maximal buccal partitioning occurred at pH 7. These data clearly indicated that the buccal absorption of captopril pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined after administration of buffered sublingual captopril (pH 7, optimal hP for absorption as determined from the buccal partitioning data) and unbuffered sublingual captopril. The study was performed in eight healthy volunteers in a randomised single-blind cross-over fashion. The tmax for captopril was found to be approximately 11 minutes earlier after buffered versus unbuffered sublingual administration and AUC0-30 min increased by approximately 30% in the case of buffered captopril. Cpmas, AUC0-180 min and relative bioavailability did not differ between the buffered and unbuffered administration. Pharmacodynamic parameters (BP, heart rate and plasma renin activity) did not differ significantly between buffered and unbuffered sublingual administration. The increased rate of captopril absorption after buffered sublingual administration was small and is likely to offer little therapeutic advantage over conventional sublingual formulation.", 
    "144": "Idrapril is the prototype of a new class of ACE inhibitors, characterised by the presence of a hydroxdmic group. Six untreated in-patients with essential hypertension were given single oral doses of the calcium salt of idrapril, idrapril calcium (200 mg) and placebo according to a double blind, randomised experimental design. Supine and upright blood pressure, heart rate, plasma idrapril serum UCE, active renin and angiotensin II were measured at timed intervals for 24 hours after dosing. Plasma idrapril reached a peak after 2 hours (3.01 microgm x ml(-1)), and by 12 hours the compound had almost disappeared (67 ng x ml(-1)). Derived t1/2 was 1.4-2.2 h. ACE activity was suppressed [from 77.9 to 3.3 after 2 hours and 11.8 after 12 hours nmol(-1) x min(-1) x ml] and angiotensin II production inhibited [from 8.8 to 3.1 (after 1 hour) and 7.5 (after 24 hours) pg x ml(-1)]. Compared to placebo, idrapril calcium significantly lowered both supine blood pressure starting at 4 hours (idrapril calcium 140/93 mmHg; placebo 157/101 mmHg; placebo 147/100 mmHg), and upright blood pressure starting at 3 hours (idrapril calcium 135/95 mmHg; placebo 147/100 mmHg) up to 24 hours (idrapril calcium 132/92 mmHg; placebo 145/100 mmHg). Idrapril calcium appears to be an effective ACE inhibitor in essential hypertension, with a hypotensive action for up to 24 h.", 
    "145": "Two groups of drugs are actual for improving effects of insulin in vivo: alpha-1-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors. The objective of this study was to examine short-term effects of cilazapril and prazosin therapy on insulin sensitivity assessed by a 15' test of insulin tolerance of obese hypertensive persons. In groups of 8 patients insulin tolerance was tested prior to and 7 days after therapy by cilazapril dosed to 2.5 mg a day and prazosin 3 mean 1-2 mg a day. In this way satisfactory control of arterial tension was achieved. No significant changes of coefficient which enable assessment of insulin effects in vivo were established. However, in the group treated with cilazapril there were 6 out of 8 patients in whom coefficient increase was registered, so that among groups there was a significant difference in coefficient change in regard to therapy with better cilazapril effects.", 
    "146": "The effects of a single oral dose (5 mg) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, on the systemic and regional vascular responses to simulated orthostatic stress by the lower body negative pressure (LBNP) technique were investigated in eight healthy volunteers, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Arterial blood pressure remained unchanged throughout the study. Ramipril increased significantly forearm (venous occlusion plethysmography, + 37% +/- 4% from 1.98 ml.min-1.100 ml-1) and renal (PAH clearance, + 6 +/- 2% from 1.20 1.min-1) blood flows and decreased corresponding vascular resistances, 150 minutes after its administration and before LBNP. It also significantly reduced calculated filtration fraction and inhibited by approximately 86% plasma ACE activity. Lower body negative pressure at -10 and -20 mmHg induced a progressive and significant decrease in central venous pressure and significant increases in forearm, splanchnic (indocyanine green clearance) and total peripheral vascular resistances which were of the same magnitude after ramipril and placebo administrations. Ramipril blunted the LBNP-induced increase in renal vascular resistance observed at -20 mmHg after placebo but a similar increase in glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance) was observed at LBNP-10 and -20 mmHg after ramipril and placebo. Calculated filtration fraction increased after placebo (LBNP-10 mmHg) and ramipril (LBNP-20 mmHg). Finally, LBNP-induced changes in biological parameters were similar after ramipril and placebo at all levels of LBNP. Thus, ramipril does not interfere with the adaptive forearm and splanchnic vascular responses and preserves renal hemodynamics during orthostatic stress simulated by LBNP in healthy volunteers.", 
    "147": "The renal kallikrein system was studied in 62 patients with coronary heart disease complicated by Functional Classes (FC) I-IV circulatory insufficiency and in 18 apparently healthy individuals. The activity of the renal kallikrein-kinin system was found to decrease in parallel to increases in FC: insignificantly in FC I circulatory disorders and significantly in FG II-IV. The use of captopril in the acute drug test in the first days and after fortnight therapy caused increases in renal kallikrein-kinin activity in patients with FC II-IV circulatory insufficiency and its decreases in FC I. The heterogeneous pattern of time courses of changes in the activity of the renal kallikrein-kinin system appeared in the clinical picture of the disease as captopril-induced hemodynamic and morphofunctional changes in the heart of patients with different FC circulatory insufficiencies.", 
    "148": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitors inhibit degradation of inflammatory mediators substance P (SP) and bradykinin, which may further stimulate the synthesis of prostaglandins. The resulting increase in inflammatory mediators in tissues is suggested to be the reason for the dry cough, involving sensory C-fiber activation, among patients receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. In the present study, the effect of an ACE-inhibitor, captopril, on ocular irritative responses was studied in the rabbit. Intravenous captopril decreased markedly the blood pressure and the intraocular pressure (IOP) modestly. Topical neutral formaldehyde elicits an irritative response in the eye mediated through sensory neuropeptides SP and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Following topical neutral formaldehyde, the increase in IOP and breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier were inhibited by captopril, while miosis was not affected. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) content in the aqueous humour was increased by captopril, and this increase was inhibited by indomethacin. Following YAG-laser anterior capsulotomy, captopril inhibited the increase in IOP, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and miosis. The present study demonstrates that use of short-term administration of captopril prior to sensory nerve stimulation or YAG laser anterior capsulotomy does not enhance the ocular responses to these stimuli in the rabbit. In the present study, captopril inhibited these responses, at least partly by decreasing the blood pressure.", 
    "149": "The structure-activity relationships of phosphoramidon analogues for inhibition of endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were compared. Phosphoramidon inhibited ECE, NEP, and ACE activities with IC50 values of 3.5, 0.034, and 78 microM, respectively. Removal of the rhamnose moiety of phosphoramidon (dipeptide 3) reduced the potency for ECE (IC50 = 70 microM), whereas the potencies for NEP (0.003 microM) and ACE (0.20 microM) were increased. Addition of 2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl to dipeptide 3 improved the potency for ECE (0.55 microM) but weakened the potency for NEP (0.02 microM), and had no significant change for ACE. Interchange between Leu and Trp abolished the inhibitory activities for ECE and NEP, but the compound remained active for ACE. These results suggest that a hydrophobic group in the P1 position of phosphoramidon analogues increases the potency for ECE significantly, whereas compounds containing a free phosphonic acid are optimal for inhibition of NEP and ACE. Furthermore, an aromatic group in the P'2 position is essential for the inhibition of ECE and NEP, but not ACE.", 
    "150": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, are reported to vary with the time of administration. The present study was undertaken to examine whether the effect of enalapril on plasma bradykinin (BK), substance P and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which are likely to be involved in the mechanism of enalapril-induced cough, might also be affected by its time of administration. Enalapril 5 mg or placebo was given orally at 10:00 h (day trial) or 22:00 h (night trial) to 12 patients with essential hypertension. Serum concentrations of total drug (enalapril + enalaprilat, its active metabolite) during the day and night trials did not differ significantly at any time. However, serum enalaprilat tended to be higher and its maximum concentration greater in the day trial than in the night trial. Blood pressure 24 h after administration of enalapril was reduced at 22:00 h, but not at 10:00 h. Plasma BK tended to increase following enalapril administration at 10:00 h, but not at 22:00 h. Remarkable increases in plasma BK were observed in two patients in the day trial and one of them also complained of cough. However, no such increase in plasma BK or subsequent adverse effect were recorded in the night trial. Plasma substance P and PGE2 did not change significantly following enalapril administration either in the day or night trial. The results suggest that the response of BK to enalapril is affected by the time of administration. In patients who complain of cough during treatment with enalapril during the daytime, this adverse effect might be diminished or eliminated by a switch to night-time administration.", 
    "151": "The aim of the study was to examine the effect of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on haemodynamics and left ventricular performance during long-lasting exercise at the anaerobic threshold. For this purpose exercise haemodynamics and left ventricular performance were assessed in 14 physically trained hypertensives (aged 26 y) before and after 3 months on quinapril 20 mg once daily. During exercise intraarterial blood pressure was monitored using the Oxford method and left ventricular dimensions were measured by M-mode echocardiography. Quinapril significantly decreased mean blood pressure during the initial incremental phase of the exercise protocol and caused a slight, nonsignificant decline during the steady-state phase. The drug-induced fall in blood pressure was accounted for mainly by change in cardiac output. Exercise duration and left ventricular performance were not affected by treatment. In conclusion, quinapril 20 mg once daily smoothed the blood pressure increase which occurs during the initial phase of vigorous endurance exercise. This result was achieved without affecting physical performance or left ventricular contractility.", 
    "152": "ACE-Inhibitors are well established in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Other indications, that are under discussion, are coronary artery disease, renal failure and diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of action of ACE-Inhibitors is not only the reduction of angiotensin II and accumulation of bradykinin but also an increase of the action potential of the heart muscle, increase in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, inhibition of platelet aggregation and opening of the K-ATP-channels.", 
    "153": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have a exaggerated risk for cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. Hypertension is very common in these patients. To date, betablockers and diuretics are the only antihypertensive agents for which a reduction of cardio- and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with or without diabetes mellitus has been proven. Metabolic effects of these substances are clinically irrelevant or non existent. Proposed advantages of the newer antihypertensive agents, such as reduction of insulin resistance or a specific nephroprotective effect of ACE-inhibitors, has not been proven yet in a scientific way.", 
    "154": "Inhibition of non-immune progression of renal insufficiency for control of glomerulonephritis was attempted via hemodynamic, metabolic and hypolipidemic means. Hemodynamic correction was conducted using inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme capoten and renitek. The action on metabolic factors of progression was realized by lovastatin mevakor. Capoten and renitek exhibited in 57 patients with chronic nephritis not only a hypotensive effect, but also reduced intraglomerular hypertension and proteinuria. A long-term (7-12 months) hypolipidemic therapy (diet and lovastatin) in 20 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis with nephrotic syndrome resulted in lowering of serum cholesterol concentrations and proteinuria, raised serum albumin. 9 patients achieved remission of nephrotic syndrome. The highest effect occurred in non-inflammatory nephropathy: membranous nephropathy, focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis, nephrosclerosis.",

Relevant clinical response was registered in 94%, hemodynamic in 83% of patients. Those with CI stage IIA and IIB benefited more. Arterial pressure went down significantly only in CHD patients with arterial hypertension. Tachycardia patients showed a reduction in pulse rate absent in bradycardia. Cardiac output increased at the expense of low afterload. Efficient doses averaged 300 mg/day.",

After 8 months PU (79 +/- 25 mg/day) GS (3 +/- 2%) and total glomerular volume (TGV; 27.9 +/- 2.9 mm3/kidney) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the low-protein diet group than in both the normal-protein group (PU 583 +/- 210 mg/day, GS 12 +/- 5%, TGV 34.6 +/- 8 mm3/kidney) and the low-CAP group (PU 611 +/- 224 mg/day, GS 16 +/- 6%, TGV 41.8 +/- 8.6 mm3/kidney). In conclusion, the development of glomerular hypertrophy and GS in Milan normotensive rats was reduced by the low-protein diet, but not by low-CAP treatment.", 
    "157": "Anaphylactoid reactions occurring in uraemic patients haemodialysed with polyacrylonitrile haemodialysis (HD) membranes and being treated with ACE inhibitors have been attributed to an excessive generation of bradykinin.",

Each patient had three consecutive HD sessions with each of the three tested membranes, high-flux SPAN, high-flux polysulphone (F60) and low-flux Hemophan (GFS Plus 16).", 
    "159": "No clinical signs of anaphylactoid reactions were observed in any of these patients but the number of patients was relatively small and the duration of exposure to different membranes relatively short. At 5 min after the start of HD session, plasma bradykinin levels were significantly higher in the venous than in the arterial line for all three HD membranes: SPAN, 18.5 +/- 11.9 versus 12.4 +/- 5.3 fmol/ml (P < 0.05); F60, 19.0 +/- 13.8 versus 11.5 +/- 6.5 fmol/ml (P < 0.01); and GFS Plus 16, 39.1 +/- 22.9 versus 15.8 +/- 12.4 fmol/ml (P < 0.005), mean +/- SD respectively. Higher venous line levels were still observed at the 15 and 60 min time points for F60 and GFS Plus 16, but not for SPAN. However, these levels were still insignificant compared to levels measured during episodes of anaphylactic shock from the literature. Plasma histamine and C5a anaphylatoxin levels did not show any increase during HD with SPAN.",

    "161": "The effect of different dialysis modes on kinin kinetics was studied in seven stable haemodialysis patients treated with AN69 dialysers and ACE inhibitors (ACEI). AN69 haemodiafiltration with calcium-enriched substitution (HDF), AN69 haemodialysis with 1.75 (HD 1.75) and 1.50 (HD 1.50) mmol/l dialysate calcium, AN69 haemodialysis with 1.25 mmol/l dialysate calcium and substitution of 2.25 mmol/h calcium (HD+Ca), and cellulose acetate haemodiafiltration (CA HDF) were compared. Dialysis was uneventful in all patients. During dialysis, serum calcium, sodium, pH, albumin, and bradykinin were measured at the start and after 5 min at arterial, venous, and postinfusion side of the extracorporeal circuit. Serum predialysis bradykinin was 107 +/- 18fmol/ml (mean +/- SEM) in patients on HDF, 61 +/- 9 fmol/ml in patients on HD 1.50, 49 +/- 13 fmol/ml in patients on HD 1.75, 35 +/- 3 fmol/l in patients on HD+Ca, and 75 +/- 27 fmol/ml in CA HDF. No significant change of mean bradykinin levels occurred after 5 min at the arterial and venous side of the dialyser or postinfusion. Individual high bradykinin levels, up to 2672 fmol/ml, were observed but without clinical consequences, suggesting that the threshold value is difficult to determine. No significant correlations were evidenced between bradykinin levels and any of the biochemical measurements. The present data show an intraindividual variability of the bradykinin levels with variation coefficients ranging from 0.386 to 2.783. The present study illustrates that haemodialysis and haemodiafiltration with AN69 in ACEI-treated patients, under the present conditions, does not result in anaphylactoid reactions or in a clinically significant release of bradykinin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the 450-mmol sodium intake period we studied the effects of renally formed dopamine by infusing its precursor DOPA (DOPAi.v., 7 micrograms kg-1 min-1). In the 50-mmol sodium intake period we studied the influence of the RAAS by administering enalaprilate (42 micrograms kg-1), followed by angiotensin II (12 ng kg-1 min-1) intravenously. GFR and ERPF were measured by continuous infusion of inulin and PAH.", 
    "164": "At all levels of sodium intake sodium balances were equal, but daily urinary excretions of dopamine and DOPA were higher (P < 0.01) in the ADPKD patients than in the controls. Renal vascular resistance, filtration fraction and blood pressure were higher in the ADPKD patients (all P < 0.05) while plasma renin activity was similar. DOPAi.v. normalized renal haemodynamics and increased plasma endothelin in ADPKD patients (all P < 0.05), while stimulation of natriuresis was equal in both groups. Enalaprilate increased plasma endothelin in the ADPKD patients and only partially normalized renal haemodynamics.", 
    "165": "In borderline hypertensive ADPKD patients: (1) urinary dopamine excretion is increased at all levels of sodium intake, suggesting that this may be needed to maintain sodium balance; (2) stimulation of renal dopamine production is able to normalize renal haemodynamics, making dopamine receptor agonism a potential therapeutic option; (3) the activity of the RAAS is not clearly enhanced; (4) renal vasodilatation increases plasma endothelin levels.", 
    "166": "Treatment of hypertension in the elderly has become not only accepted but also a highly ethical, effective and compelling procedure following the many clearly positive reports on the benefits of lowering elevated arterial pressure in elderly patients. So far most intervention studies in elderly hypertensive patients have used diuretics or beta-blockers or the two in combination as the moiety by which blood pressure has been lowered. However, from a theoretical point of view, more novel therapies could offer advantages that would translate into an even better reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than has been obtained with the traditional antihypertensive therapies used so far. Some of the studies in elderly hypertensives that are in progress using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists as the main therapies, e.g. the STOP-Hypertension-2 Study and the Syst-Eur Study, will be briefly reviewed here as will the large data base on urapidil, a dual action antihypertensive drug used in the treatment of elderly hypertensives. By careful evaluation of the effects of novel antihypertensive drugs, and the already existing data base on urapidil in elderly hypertensive patients, it is likely that still better reduction of risk can be obtained in the elderly hypertensives by the use of more novel therapies than diuretics and beta-blockers.", 
    "167": "We have identified angiotensin-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase-24.11, and aminopeptidase M in a purified glycoprotein fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle membranes. The identification was based on substrate specificity and sensitivity to selective inhibitors. Angiotensin I metabolism was due to angiotensin-converting enzyme-mediated conversion to angiotensin II and neutral endopeptidase-24.11-mediated conversion to angiotensin(1-7). Bradykinin was degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase-24.11; angiotensin II by neutral endopeptidase-24.11; and angiotensin III by neutral endopeptidase-24.11 and aminopeptidase M. Thus, the effects of angiotensins and kinins on skeletal muscle blood flow and metabolism may be regulated by local angiotensin-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase-24.11, and aminopeptidase M.", 
    "168": "This report reviews the features of erythropoietin (Epo) production after renal transplantation. Successful kidney transplantation leads to the correction of renal anaemia over an 8-10 week period. An early ineffective peak of serum Epo may occur when there is delayed graft function. A late peak follows the decrease in serum creatinine and this is associated with a rise in haemoglobin. Serum Epo returns to normal when the haematocrit reaches 32%. Acute early rejection causes a striking reduction in serum Epo and reticulocytosis. In some patients the haematocrit continues to increase after complete correction of anaemia, resulting in post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE). PTE generally appears to be an idiopathic erythrocytosis independent of Epo secretion. A greater Epo sensitivity of erythroid progenitors has been suggested. Theophylline and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which attenuate Epo production, can be used to treat PTE. The second part of this report describes the possible impact of human recombinant Epo (rHuEpo) on renal transplantation. The avoidance of blood transfusion with rHuEpo should eliminate the initiation of anti-HLA sensitization in uraemic patients without previous pregnancy and prior allograft. In some but not all presensitized patients transfusion withdrawal may reduce the sensitization level. There is currently no evidence that the reversing of anaemia by rHuEpo in kidney recipients impairs early graft function. Our results suggest that treatment with rHuEpo prior to transplantation may prevent the appearance of PTE. rHuEPO will reverse anaemia in patients with a failing graft and severe anaemia with little risk of accelerating graft failure and adverse events.", 
    "169": "Improving patient survival is the ultimate goal after acute myocardial infarction. Although thrombolytics, aspirin, and beta-blockers have greatly decreased mortality, structural changes such as ventricular dilatation evolving within the myocardium during and after acute myocardial infarction indicate a poor prognosis. The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial demonstrated that when administered 3 to 16 days after acute myocardial infarction in selected patients, captopril, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reduces ventricular dilatation, prevents the development of congestive heart failure, and reduces morbidity and mortality. This paper reviews results of that trial and presents guidelines for effective captopril dosage after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "170": "A three-months toxicity study of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, rentiapril (CAS 80830-42-8), was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats by oral administration. The dose levels of 0, 30, 125, 500 and 1000 mg/kg were tested in both sexes, in which each experimental group comprised 10 rats. Another ACE inhibitor, captopril, was used as a reference compound. Rentiapril at the highest dose of 1000 mg/kg caused low food consumption and death of some animals with signs of bloody feces and anemia. In males and females receiving 500 and 1000 mg/kg, there were low body weight gain, increases in water intake, urine volume and serum BUN level, and decreases in levels of various erythrocytic parameters. Kidney weight was increased dose-dependently in both sexes. Histopathologically, renal changes in the 500 and 1000 mg/kg groups consisted of proximal tubular degeneration, juxtaglomerular cell hyperplasia and interstitial cell infiltration. Similar, but mild, changes in proximal tubules were present in the female 125 mg/kg group. Dead animals from the highest dose groups further showed gastrointestinal hemorrhagic erosion and/or ulcer, decreased bone marrow erythropoiesis and hepatocytic vacuolar degeneration. There was no pathological alteration in rats from other rentiapril-treated groups, as well as in controls. These results indicate that the no-effect dose of rentiapril in rats by three months oral administration is 30 mg/kg in female and 125 mg/kg in male, and suggest that, like other ACE-inhibitors, this compound also has a toxic potential to affect renal tissues.", 
    "171": "Several studies have shown that long-term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may reduce urinary protein excretion and decrease the rate of progression of renal disease in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus more effectively than conventional antihypertensive drugs. Only few studies, however, have been performed in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). To compare the effects of captopril with more conventional drugs on proteinuria and progression of renal disease, we conducted a prospective, 18-month study in 42 proteinuric (> 500 mg/day) NIDDM and, for comparison, in 31 nondiabetic patients with a variety of renal diseases (NDRD). Twenty-four NIDDM patients were treated with captopril and 18 with conventional drugs. Eighteen NDRD patients received captopril, and 13 received conventional drugs. Baseline proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were not different among groups. The blood pressure decreased equally in all group of patients, irrespective of whether they received captopril or conventional drugs. Urinary protein excretion, however, decreased significantly only in NIDDM and NDRD patients treated with captopril. The GFR decreased only in patients treated with conventional drugs, but not in those treated with captopril. The rate of decline in GFR in NIDDM patients treated with captopril was significantly lower than in patients treated with conventional drugs. However, in NDRD patients treated with captopril, the rate of decline in GFR was not different from that in patients treated with conventional drugs. The reduction of urinary protein excretion was poorly correlated with changes in blood pressure or with changes in renal function and renal hemodynamics. Serum potassium increased significantly in patients treated with captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "172": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are suspected of inducing angioedemas in up to 0.2% of all patients. These angioedemas are mainly localized in the upper airways and therefore can cause severe airway obstruction and even death due to suffocation. We report the case of a 64-year-old man, who underwent emergency tracheotomy because of severe angioedema of the larynx, which was refractory to pharmacological treatment. We conclude that patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedemas should be observed by monitoring in an intensive care unit to ensure the possibility of early intubation, because conventional antiallergic-antiedematous therapy by histamine-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids is an insufficient, unreliable form of therapy in severe cases. Especially otolaryngologists should know about this uncommon potentially life-threatening side-effect of ACE inhibitors.",

This report describes the case of a 53-year-old female patient with neurotic depression and an initially unsuspected chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Following previous treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril, and an estrogen derivative, the patient developed an episode of the ITP after beginning treatment with maprotiline.

The exact mechanisms of this nephroprotective effect are not yet fully understood, but changes in hemodynamic parameters, a reduction of proteinuria and an inhibition of glomerular cell proliferation appear to be involved in preventing glomerulosclerosis.",

This involves an aggressive interventional approach aimed at restoring coronary artery patency early while decreasing myocardial oxygen demands. Abundant data show that coronary flow can be reestablished using either intravenous chemical thrombolytic agents (tissue-type plasminogen activator and streptokinase), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Conjunctive aspirin or heparin therapy (or both) is effective in maintaining vessel patency once perfusion is restored. Myocardial oxygen demand can be reduced, where feasible, by pharmacotherapy and control of the patient's associated pain and anxiety. The beta-adrenergic blockers and nitrates are particularly suitable in this regard, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors favorably affect infarct expansion and ventricular remodeling. With such an approach, infarct size can be reduced, leading to improved left ventricular function--the prime determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute infarction. The in-hospital mortality has fallen from about 30% three decades ago to less than 8% in many coronary care units.", 
    "176": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week trial was performed to determine the antihypertensive and metabolic effects of enalapril (20 to 40 mg/d) in 16 hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) aged 55 +/- 2 years and with a body mass index of 29 +/- 1 kg/m2. Glucose utilization was determined after an overnight fast and during insulin stimulation at 0 and 4 weeks (methods: euglycemic clamp, [3-3H]glucose infusion, indirect calorimetry). Enalapril decreased systolic (166 +/- 4 v 152 +/- 5 mm Hg, P < .05) and diastolic (102 +/- 2 v 95 +/- 2 mm Hg, P < .05) blood pressure. Peripheral insulin sensitivity, ie, insulin stimulation of glucose utilization, increased approximately 30%, or by 4.3 +/- 1.7 mumol/kg.min (13.1 +/- 2.0 v 17.4 +/- 3.5 mumol/kg.min, P < .05, 0 v 4 weeks) during enalapril treatment, but remained unchanged during placebo treatment (15.4 +/- 2.8 v 15.3 +/- 2.7 mumol/kg.min, respectively). The increase in glucose utilization during enalapril treatment was fully explained by an increase of 4.1 +/- 1.7 mumol/kg.min in glucose storage (4.1 +/- 1.2 v 8.1 +/- 2.9 mumol/kg.min, P < .05) while glucose oxidation remained unchanged. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 8% (P < .05) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) improved slightly (7.7% +/- 0.7% v 7.3% +/- 0.7%, P < .05) in the enalapril group, but not in the placebo group. We conclude that enalapril improves insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose storage in hypertensive patients with NIDDM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After a selection phase of 4 to 6 weeks with patients under antihypertensive therapy with 20 mg furosemide daily, 115 patients with either controlled or uncontrolled hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either placebo (n = 40), 1.25 mg (low dose, n = 38), or 5 mg (regular dose, n = 37) ramipril daily for 6 months. Treatment with furosemide was continued unchanged during this phase. The main outcome measured was left ventricular hypertrophy regression as assessed from central blind reading of echocardiograms recorded at randomization and after 6 months. No significant differences were observed for changes in casual or ambulatory blood pressure between the three groups. Left ventricular mass index was found to be significantly reduced in patients receiving 5 mg ramipril compared with those receiving placebo (-10.8 +/- 3.7 versus +4.1 +/- 4.0 g/m2, P = .008); in patients receiving 1.25 mg ramipril, the difference was close to borderline significance compared with placebo (-7.0 +/- 4.3 g/m2, P = .06).

    "188": "The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of chronic captopril treatment on blood pressure in young and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and to assess the time course for development of hypertension after captopril withdrawal. SHR received drinking water or captopril solution from 4 weeks of age and were instrumented with radiotelemetry devices at 18 weeks of age to allow continuous monitoring of blood pressure. At 23 weeks of age, mean blood pressure in the captopril group was 100 +/- 1 mm Hg compared with 157 +/- 3 mm Hg in the water group. Pulse pressure also was significantly reduced in the captopril-treated rats. Infusion of angiotensin II into a subset of captopril-treated rats increased pulse pressure and restored blood pressure to levels of water-treated rats. Captopril treatment for 6 weeks in adult, 24-week-old SHR did not reduce blood pressure to the level of rats treated from 4 weeks of age. Ten weeks after cessation of captopril, blood pressure was 125 +/- 4 and 144 +/- 4 mm Hg in SHR treated with captopril from 4 to 30 and from 24 to 30 weeks of age, respectively, compared with control hypertensive rats with mean blood pressure of 160 +/- 6 mm Hg. Results from this radiotelemetry study confirm previous findings that captopril treatment prevents the development of hypertension and produces a persistent reduction of blood pressure after treatment in young SHR. Captopril treatment produced a persistent reduction of blood pressure after discontinuation in adult rats; however, the effect was less than that observed with captopril initiated in young rats.",

Amlodipine (10 mg) was more effective than the same dose of lisinopril in controlling hypertension (mean 24-hour arterial pressure, 111 +/- 9 and 115 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively; P < .05). Blood pressure during both treatments was lower than during placebo (124 +/- 12 mm Hg, P < .05). Compared with placebo, amlodipine treatment was associated with a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (10 +/- 20%, P < .05) and effective renal plasma flow (27 +/- 20%, P < .01) and a decrease in renal vascular resistance (23 +/- 18%, P < .01). Renal hemodynamics did not change during lisinopril. Neither drug had an effect on proteinuria. The data indicate that amlodipine is more effective than lisinopril in controlling hypertension in cyclosporine-treated patients and that treatment with amlodipine but not with lisinopril is accompanied by an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow and a decrease in renal vascular resistance. The data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system does not play a main role in determining cyclosporine-associated changes in renal hemodynamics and has a limited role in determining cyclosporine-associated hypertension.",

Qualifying patients (n = 51) were allocated to placebo, 25 or 100 mg losartan, or 20 mg enalapril. Blood pressure, plasma drug concentrations, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system mediators were measured on 4 inpatient days: end of placebo run-in, after first dose, and 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. Plasma drug concentrations were similar after the first and last doses of losartan. At 6 weeks, 100 mg losartan and 20 mg enalapril showed comparable antihypertensive activity. Four hours after dosing, compared with the run-in day, 100 mg losartan increased plasma renin activity 1.7-fold and Ang II 2.5-fold, whereas enalapril increased plasma renin activity 2.8-fold and decreased Ang II 77%. Both drugs decreased plasma aldosterone concentration. For losartan, plasma renin activity and Ang II increases were greater at 2 than at 6 weeks. Effects of losartan were dose related. After the last dose of losartan, plasma renin activity and Ang II changes were similar to placebo changes by 36 hours. These results indicate that long-term blockade of the feedback Ang II receptor in hypertensive patients produces modest increases of plasma renin activity and Ang II that do not appear to affect the antihypertensive response to the antagonist.",

In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), RB 105 i.v. dose-dependently decreased blood pressure and dose-independently caused natriuresis with dose-dependent increases in urinary cGMP and plasma renin concentration, and decrease in plasma ACE activity. RB 105 increased urinary excretion of both immunoreactive ANP and bradykinin. RB 105 completely blocked the hypertensive response of exogenous angiotensin I. Furthermore, RB 105 potentiated the hypotensive and natriuretic response to ANP and potentiated the hypotensive responses of bradykinin in SHR. Intravenous RB 105 decreased blood pressure similarly in DOCA-salt, renovascular (1C-2K) and spontaneously hypertensive rats and induced a similar natriuretic response in these three different renin-dependent and -independent models of hypertension. RB 105 also had hypotensive and natriuretic effects in normotensive rats. RB 105 also induced an increase in urinary excretion of cGMP and bradykinin and in plasma renin concentration in hypertensive and normotensive rats. In conclusion, RB 105 is a new dual inhibitor of ACE and NEP able to target both blood pressure and renal sodium handling in different experimental renin-dependent and -independent models of hypertension.",

Although no systematic experimental studies or controlled clinical observations are available, lithium is known to activate the renin angiotensin system through several mechanisms. In addition, direct interactions between lithium and angiotensin II may take place on a cellular level.

Two groups of inhibitors in the viscous material, high and low molecular weight inhibitors, were resolved by dialysis test. The inhibitor of high molecular weight was a protein with low IC50 value (0.12 mg/ml). The two types of low molecular weight inhibitors were detected in ethanol extracts (IC50: 0.53 mg/ml and 0.95 mg/ml) and they were found to be stable over a wide range of pH and temperature up to 100 degrees C. They were different in the mode of ACE inhibition. One is competitive, and the other noncompetitive against the hydrolysis of Bz-Gly-His-Leu by ACE.",

We have observed increased levels of diene conjugates, carbonyls and malondialdehyde as well as protein carbonyls after ischaemia-reperfusion, whereas protein sulphydryl groups were decreased.

    "210": "To determine whether the renal sympatho-inhibition and bradycardia in responses to acute increases in arterial pressure are altered in the diabetic state, the renal nerve discharge and heart rate were measured in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic (DIA) rats. Integrated renal sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate were measured before and during an acute increase in blood pressure in anesthetized (Inactin 0.1 g/kg, i.p.) control (vehicle) and DIA rats (Sprague Dawley rats injected with STZ 65 mg/kg i.p.). Blood glucose levels were significantly elevated in the DIA group compared with the control group. Baroreflex changes in renal nerve activity and heart rate were not significantly different in the DIA rats compared with control rats at a time when the renal sympatho-inhibition in response to acute volume expansion was blunted in the diabetic rats. In addition, blocking the effect of elevated angiotensin II in diabetic rats with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril did not change the baroreflex function in DIA rats compared with control rats. However, administration of vasopressin failed to potentiate the baroreflex in diabetic rats as it did in normal control rats. This study demonstrates that (1) the baroreflex function is normal in STZ induced diabetic rats unlike the volume reflex during the early phase of the disease, (2) blockade of the AII system does not alter baroreflex function in diabetic rats and (3) vasopressin fails to potentiate the baroreflex in diabetic rats as it does in the euglycemic normal rats.", 
    "211": "The fundus and retinal ultrastructural changes of rats with hypertension and such rats having taken life-long captopril treatment were examined by funduscope, light and transmission electron microscopes. The normal rats were the controls. The results showed that in the hypertension group, the ratio of the diameter of the retinal artery to that of the vein was 1:2, the arteries were spastic and narrowed, their light reflexes were widened and their calibers of the lumens were uneven, the fundus appearances being consistent with grade I and II retinal changes of systemic hypertension. Under the light microscope, it was discovered that the basement membranes of the retinal capillaries were thickened and their lumens narrowed, resulting in retinal ischemia and anoxia. Under the transmission electron microscope, the main pathological changes involved the external segments of photoreceptors and ganglionic cells. The pathological changes were hazy renewed membranous discs at the basal portions of the external segments of photoreceptors, edematous ganglionic cells being the majority, their cytoplasm stained pale, mitochondrial vacuolization, enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticula and degranulation of rough endoplasmic reticula. In the group of rats with hypertension having taken life-long captopril treatment, the fundi and blood pressure remained normal and no significant ultrastructural changes had taken place in their retinae.", 
    "212": "ACE-inhibitors are known to have special renal effects, i.e. they increase ERPF, decrease the filtration fraction and lower proteinuria. These effects can be due to a decrease in angiotensin II (AII) levels as well as an increase in bradykinin. New and more specific AII-receptor antagonists may help to distinguish between effects exerted by angiotensin II and those exerted by bradykinin. We investigated the effects of losartan in 9 patients with essential hypertension (sitting mean diastolic blood pressure 95-120 mmHg). Renal hemodynamics were measured by continuous inulin-and PAH-clearance (GFR and RPF) after stopping antihypertensive therapy for 1 week, followed by a 2-week placebo period and after a 4-week treatment phase with losartan (50 mg/die) followed by a therapy with an ACE-inhibitor (ramipril 5mg/die). Additionally, urine albumin excretion (UAE) was measured. Treatment of patients with essential hypertension with losartan resulted in a significant decrease of MAP after three weeks of treatment (121 +/- 8 mmHg under placebo and 114 +/- 10 mmHg under losartan; * = p < 0.05). MAP after four weeks of losartan treatment was 115 +/- 11 mmHg. Regarding changes in renal hemodynamics we could not demonstrate a significant change for neither losartan nor the ACE-inhibitor. Urine albumin excretion was reduced by both treatment regimens in correlation to the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Our data indicate that losartan induced a significant reduction in MAP in patients with essential arterial hypertension with only moderate effects on renal hemodynamics.",

Nephropathy (tubular degeneration and regeneration), thickening of the basal lamina, mononuclear cell infiltration, and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus were seen by light microscopy. Ultrastructurally, juxtaglomerular cell granules were increased in number and displayed substantial structural heterogeneity. In some cells, granules contained paracrystalline inclusions while others consisted predominantly of myelinic debris. Evidence of conversion of arteriolar smooth muscle cells into juxtaglomerular cells and their degeneration was also obtained by electron microscopy. The juxtaglomerular changes were treatment- and dose-related and were attributed to an exaggerated pharmacological action of the compound, that is, ZD6888-mediated blockade of AII receptors leading to competitive inhibition of the AII-mediated release of renin. The resemblance between the findings seen in the present study following administration of an AII antagonist and those due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reported by others was striking.", 
    "214": "In Wistar rats just after weaning, 5/6 of renal parenchyma were removed surgically. Thereafter, the rats were fed either a \"high-protein\" (21%) or two types of a \"low-protein\" (6%) diet; in one of the latter the lack of protein was substituted by saccharide, in the other by fat, making the substitution \"isocaloric\" in either case. In all three diet groups, subgroups were formed drinking either tap water or water containing either the ACE inhibitor enalapril (Ena) or the calcium antagonist diltiazem (Dil), or both (Ena + Dil). In the high-protein diet group, increases in the weight of kidney remnants, in proteinuria and in systolic blood pressure (SBP) were seen. This was prevented by feeding either type of the low-protein diet but also by Ena and Ena + Dil. Ena and Ena + Dil not only prevented the increase in SBP but actually lowered it significantly. Dil alone also had a SBP-lowering action but offered no protection from kidney hypertrophy and proteinuria. No additive protective action of Ena + Dil or Ena + low protein or Ena + Dil + low protein was seen, suggesting that a bottom limit of these protective action was reached by the low-protein diet alone. There was no substantial difference between either type of the low-protein diet except a small and transient decrease in body weight in the first week of fat-rich diet administration.", 
    "215": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the prodrug ramipril and its active ACE-inhibiting metabolite ramiprilat were investigated in an open, randomised, three-way cross-over study in 12 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received 2.5 mg ramipril orally, 2.5 mg ramipril intravenously and 2.5 mg ramiprilat intravenously. The absolute bioavailability as judged by ramipril plasma AUC was 15%, by ramiprilat plasma AUC, 44%. Ramiprilat formation from intravenous ramipril was 53% and from oral ramipril 28%. Urinary recovery of oral ramipril was 23%, i.v. ramipril 49%, and i.v. ramiprilat 68% of the given dose. Maximum ACE inhibition was highest (100%) after i.v. ramiprilat; it was 99% after i.v. ramipril and 84% following oral ramipril. ACE inhibition over 24 h was highest after i.v. ramipril, 2% less with i.v. ramiprilat and 34% less with oral ramipril. Ramiprilat renal clearance was concentration dependent. The biological availability of ramipril can best be judged by ramiprilat AUC, urinary recovery of ramipril and metabolites, or ACE inhibition over 24 h. It is concluded that the bioavailability of oral ramipril seems to be in the range of 44-66%.", 
    "216": "1. Inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) EC 3.4.24.11 were developed to regulate endogenous levels of the natriuretic and vasodilatory hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). The selective NEP inhibitor SQ 28603 enhanced the increases in plasma ANP and urinary excretion of ANP, cyclic GMP and sodium stimulated by infusion of human ANP in conscious monkeys. SQ 28603 also potentiated the renal and depressor responses to rat brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and human BNP in conscious monkeys. Therefore, selective NEP inhibitors protected both natriuretic peptides from degradation in vivo and enhanced their biological activities. 2. Selective NEP inhibitors lowered blood pressure in conscious DOCA/salt hypertensive rats and SHR with antihypertensive activity similar to that of exogenous ANP. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enhanced the depressor activity of the NEP inhibitor in SHR. 3. SQ 28603 stimulated urinary excretion of cyclic GMP and sodium in a dose-related manner in conscious dogs with tachycardia-induced heart failure. Addition of the ACE inhibitor captopril significantly reduced blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance while sustaining sodium excretion and increasing cardiac output, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Therefore, combined NEP and ACE inhibition produced a unique haemodynamic and renal profile in dogs with pacing-induced heart failure. 4. The novel dual metalloprotease inhibitor BMS-182657 potentiated the renal responses to exogenous ANP and suppressed the pressor response to angiotensin I in conscious monkeys, indicating in vivo inhibition of both NEP and ACE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Aortic regurgitation was induced by perforation of the aortic valve in 12 rabbits. Sixty mg/kg of alacepril was administered by gastric tube for 7 days after manifestation of aortic regurgitation to 6 rabbits (group AR + A). The other 6 rabbits with aortic regurgitation were administered vehicle in the same fashion (group AR + C). Seven rabbits underwent sham operation (group S). One week after induction of aortic regurgitation left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher and cardiac output was lower in AR + C than in S. End-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular diameter were larger and left ventricular weight was also higher in AR + C than in S. For each of these parameters, the opposite findings were obtained from a comparison of AR + A and S. Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density and norepinephrine content were reduced in AR + C, but were restored in AR + A. These findings indicate that alacepril has beneficial effects on ventricular remodeling and function, and on sympatho-neuronal regulation in the volume-overloaded myocardium.",

Myocytes from both ventricles were approximately 90% mononuclear from birth to 4-5 days of age. By 14 days, 67% of LVFW myocytes and 53% of RVFW myocytes were multinucleated. When growth of the heart was restrained by treatment of the piglet with enalapril maleate, the LVFW mass was reduced by 24% over 2 weeks compared to hearts from untreated piglets and was accounted for by a reduction in myocyte volume. Enalapril treatment did not alter the number of myocytes in either the LVFW or RVFW as compared to hearts from untreated piglets. After 14 days of enalapril treatment, the percentage of multinucleated cells was reduced in the LVFW and unchanged in the RVFW as compared to hearts from untreated piglets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Furthermore, losartan treatment, captopril treatment and losartan + captopril treatment all significantly decreased urinary protein excretion, urinary albumin excretion and serum creatinine to the same extent. These effects were sustained for the entire experimental period and were not associated with any significant changes in body weight, urine volume, urine sugar and urinary electrolytes excretion. These results were confirmed by morphological analysis of kidneys in each group of rats. Losartan treatment, captopril treatment and losartan+captopril treatment all significantly and effectively protected against an increase in the percentage of focal glomerular sclerosis.

To test the hypothesis that basal renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) activity impairs the acute natriuretic response to frusemide in patients with mild or moderate congestive heart failure (CHF), we studied eight adult volunteers with preserved renal function, stable New York Heart Association Class II or III CHF, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction due to myocardial infarction, hypertension, or both causes. 2. All patients received three dosing regimens administered in random order: (a) intravenous frusemide: 40 mg bolus then 40 mg h-1 for 3 h, (b) captopril: two 12.5 mg oral doses separated by 2 h, (c) combined dosing: the first captopril dose preceded the frusemide bolus by 30 min. Sodium balance on an 80 mmol day-1 sodium diet was documented prior to each dosing regimen. Sodium excretion was quantitated in urine collected at intervals until 3.5 h after initiating drug administration. During this time, urine output was replaced intravenously with an equivalent volume of 0.45% saline. 3.

    "231": "Physiological and pathological effects of kinins result from the activation of specific receptors which are present in various organs. Kinin receptors have been characterized through studies on isolated organs in vitro and have been classified as B1 and B2. A careful analysis of B2 receptors led to the identification of two subtypes, namely B2rb (in the rabbit) and B2gp (in the guinea-pig). The distinction between B2rb and B2gp receptors is primarily based on differences in the activities of selective agonists and particularly on differences in affinities of competitive antagonists, namely DArg[Hyp3,DPhe7,Leu8]BK and the non-peptide compound, WIN 64338. The non-competitive antagonist, HOE 140, has shown the same affinity on B2rb and B2gp. The potential role of B1 and B2 receptors in physiopathology is analysed on data obtained with specific and selective antagonists of the B1 (desArg9[Leu8]BK) and B2 (HOE140) receptors. The therapeutic potential of endogenous kinins as mediators of the therapeutic beneficial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or the potential of the use of exogenous kinins in the vascular permeability are discussed together with the therapeutic potential of B1 and B2 receptor antagonists.", 
    "232": "We compared the effects of acute and chronic ACE inhibition (ACEi) on the 123I-hippurate in the stenotic kidney of two 2-kidney, 1-clip hypertensive dogs. In the period after clip implantation poststenotic renograms without ACEi of both dogs were normal. Acute ACEi always resulted in delayed hippurate handling. Chronic ACEi, however, induced abnormal poststenotic renograms in only 36% of the cases. Withdrawal of chronic ACEi restored the phenomenon of acute ACE-induced delayed hippurate handling within 5 months in both dogs. These data indicate that chronic ACEi or recent ACEi medication reduces the effectiveness of ACEi renography in diagnosing hypertension due to a moderate renal-artery stenosis. This phenomenon may explain why the sensitivity of ACEi renography in human studies varies more than in animal studies.",

This biochemical feature allowed us to ascribe the pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis both to the increased plasma level of lactic acid and to the type IV renal tubular acidosis syndrome, the precipitating factor being an infection of urinary tract (as we assumed on the basis of the urine culture). The patient was dehydrated and lethargic; the ECG revealed the presence of nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia. The clinical evolution was favorable thanks to the treatment with the infusion of isotonic saline solutions, mild alkalinizing solutions, low-dose regular insulin and antibiotics. It is likely that metformin and enalapril, regularly assumed by the patient, could have played a iatrogenic role even if they were taken in low dosages. This event points out the importance of complying with the indications and especially the contraindications of these drugs, to avoid life threatening complications as that one occurred in this case.",

    "235": "The effects of ethanol have been studied in the central nervous system, however there exists only scarce information about the effects of ethanol on endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. As some properties of brain endothelial cells are modulated by underlying astrocytes, the effect of ethanol on cerebral microvasculature might be indirect and mediated by astrocytes. To analyse this question, we added to rat brain-derived endothelial cells (rbEC) in culture either only ethanol (0, 15 and 150 mM) or ethanol conjointly with soluble factors secreted by astrocytes. Alternatively, astrocytes were exposed to ethanol and the medium was added to rbEC. The effects of treatments were evaluated on cell growth and expression of specific proteolytic markers of rbEC. The experiments showed that while the addition of ethanol alone to rbEC increased the expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and cell growth following an initial toxic effect, the most significant effects were seen when ethanol was added to rbEC together with astrocytic factors or when medium conditioned by astrocytes exposed to ethanol was added to rbEC. In particular, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme in endothelial cells was dose-dependently increased. These results indicate that the hypertensive and toxic effects of ethanol are mediated by ethanol and soluble factor(s) secreted by astrocytes and dependent on the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme in the brain endothelium. Thus, when evaluating in vitro the effects of toxic substances such as ethanol on the cerebral endothelium, the modulating effect of cells surrounding cerebral vessels must be accounted for.", 
    "236": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death in Western industrialized countries. CHD is more common in individuals with clustering of coronary risk factors, e.g., hypertension and blood lipid abnormalities. There is a good rationale for the use of beta-blockers for prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in high-risk groups, as beta-blockade decreases myocardial oxygen consumption and, by decreasing turbulent blood flow patterns, reduces endothelial shear forces, thus making plaque rupture (and the ensuing thrombotic events) less likely. Clinical trial data have shown beta-blockade to be effective in the prevention of cardiovascular end points. In both younger and older hypertensive patients there is a significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and in younger hypertensive patients there is about a 15% reduction in MI. Left ventricular hypertrophy (particularly by ECG) is significantly diminished. In secondary prevention of MI there is about 15% reduction after early and 25-30% reduction after late intervention with beta-blockers given post-MI. In both stable and unstable angina, beta-blockade appears to be beneficial not only in improvement of symptoms but also in prevention of hard cardiovascular end points. There are also promising data suggesting that beta-blockade is useful in endothelial protection and atheroma prevention, and benefits patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. beta-Blockers have evolved from early nonselective agents, e.g., propranolol, to modern highly beta 1-selective agents, e.g., bisoprolol. beta 1-Blockade is the essential element that leads to the above cardiovascular benefits in addition to improving the quality of life (similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors).",

The abbreviated case histories of six patients who came to the author with specific questions regarding therapy of their hypertension and renal impairment illustrate the fact that one of any number of therapies might have reduced blood pressure in these patients, but in each, there was a specific reason to attempt a single approach first. If physicians could better understand and extrapolate the results of clinical research to the treatment of specific patients, choice of therapy might become more successful.", 
    "238": "Overt proteinuria is often accompanied by hypercholesterolemia and is associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels. These lipid abnormalities are probably involved in the high incidence of macrovascular complications associated with diabetic nephropathy and possibly other kinds of non-diabetic proteinuric renal disease. Over the last decade many studies have shown that ACE inhibitors can reduce urinary protein excretion but little attention was paid to the impact of this form of therapeutic intervention on the lipid profile. In this article we review our recent data showing that fosinopril administration was associated with significant decreases in both urinary protein excretion, serum total cholesterol levels, and plasma lp(a) levels. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with renal impairment can result in the development of hyperkalemia as a result of suppression of angiotensin II-driven aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may depend on the degree of inhibition of angiotensin II formation in the circulation and also locally in the adrenal gland. Because the various ACE inhibitors exhibit different degrees of ACE inhibition at the tissue level, we have postulated that angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone production will be inhibited to a lesser degree by agents that have low tissue affinity for the adrenal gland. The implication of this theoretical concept for the development of hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function treated with ACE inhibitors is discussed.", 
    "239": "The use of antihypertensive agents in patients with renal insufficiency necessitates careful consideration of dosages, titration, and monitoring. Renal function must be estimated to appropriately make dosage adjustments for antihypertensives that exhibit extensive renal elimination. Thiazide diuretics are useful in mild degrees of renal insufficiency but loop diuretics become necessary as renal function deteriorates further. With either class, low dosages should be used to prevent hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia which may worsen renal blood flow. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become popular because they may have unique renal protective properties. All ACE inhibitors except fosinopril require reduced dosages and/or less frequent administration in patients with renal insufficiency. It is often necessary to use a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor and special dosing considerations are important. Due to demographic and physiologic characteristics of patients with renal insufficiency, beta blockers are often reserved for patients with other indications for beta blockers such as ischemic heart disease. Several beta blockers are eliminated primarily by the kidney and dosage reductions are necessary for these agents. Calcium antagonists may also have renal protective effects. Because calcium antagonists are metabolized extensively, significant dosage adjustments are not necessary. Data suggest that antihypertensives may slow the decline in renal insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of several antihypertensives change with renal impairment because of reduced elimination. Therefore, dosage adjustments, slower titration, and less frequent administration are often necessary.", 
    "240": "Weight reduction and food restriction increase the self-administration of alcohol and other drugs of abuse, but the underlying physiological mechanisms have not been identified. Because weight reduction alters angiotensin (ANG) II activity, and ANG II is known to modulate alcohol intake, ANG II may play a role in the enhanced alcohol consumption of food-deprived weight-reduced rats and in the drop in alcohol intake when these rats are refed. Two groups of rats were reduced to and maintained at 80% of their free feeding weights and offered daily 40 min access to a 6% (w/v) alcohol solution and water. Water was available ad lib. After alcohol intake stabilized, one group was given daily injections of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5.0 mg/kg) for 6 days while the other group received the saline vehicle. Following this, each group continued to receive either captopril or vehicle injections but was returned to ad lib feeding. Captopril did not alter alcohol intake when the rats were food-deprived and weight-reduced, but did significantly attenuate the decline in alcohol consumption compared to the vehicle group when both groups were refed and regaining weight. These findings suggest that the increase in alcohol intake with food restriction and its decline following refeeding are, in part, related to changes in ANG II activity.", 
    "241": "Angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (alacepril and imidapril) or an AT1-receptor antagonist (SC-52458) was administered to 10-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for 7 days, and cardiac mRNA levels for contractile proteins and atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) were comprehensively measured. The expression of skeletal alpha-actin and ANP was selectively enhanced in the heart of vehicle-treated SHR compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), thereby suggesting that the phenotypic modulation of myocytes occurred at the early stage of hypertension. The above-mentioned three drugs similarly suppressed these enhanced gene expressions, nearly to the control levels. In contrast, although the treatment with hydralazine lowered the blood pressure of SHR similarly, hydralazine did not suppress ANP expression at all and only partially suppressed skeletal alpha-actin. Moreover, alacepril did not affect these gene expressions in WKY. Thus, AT1 receptor may be crucial for phenotypic modulation in the heart of SHR.", 
    "242": "The principle functions of the heart are to accept blood from the systemic and the pulmonary circulatory system, pump and deliver it to the whole body tissues and lungs. The term \"heart failure\" is used to describe the pathophysiological state in which an abnormality of cardiac function is responsible for failure of the heart to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues, or to do so only from an elevated filling pressure. Thus, for a long period, heart failure has been thought of as a mechanical disorder of the heart and vessels, and its treatment has been based on improving impaired cardiac function and hemodynamic disorder. Recently multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled survival trials revealed that pure inotropic agents such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors succeeded in mechanical improvement, yet not only failed to prolong the patient's life, but also increased mortality. A number of neurohumoral mechanisms, which are activated in heart failure, were thought to be compensatory ones. However, survival trials demonstrated that two types of drug interfering with the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system reduced mortality. Those drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers. ACE inhibitors reduce the direct effects of angiotensin II on myocardial cells, which may lead to cell necrosis, imbalanced remodeling through fibrosis, and attenuate the progressive ventricular dilatation. Local tissue renin-angiotensin system may be potentially important in regulating the angiotensin II production in both heart and vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

According to the new model, six differential equations were given which considered the mass balance of both compounds in each component. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by the simultaneous curve fitting method using the plasma concentration data and the urinary excretion data of imidapril and imidaprilat in a multiple dosing study of healthy human volunteers. To validate the value of each parameter, this pharmacokinetic model was also applied to analyze the various plasma concentration data of both compounds in the single dosing studies with four different dosages, 2.5,5, 10, and 20 mg. Excellent curve fitting was obtained in every case, suggesting that the proposed pharmacokinetic model is applicable for predicting the plasma concentrations of imidapril and imidaprilat under various dosage conditions of clinical use.",

MK-996 prevents the pressor response to intravenous AII in the conscious rat, dog, and rhesus monkey (ED50, mg/kg; oral/intravenous = 0.067/0.014, 0.035/0.017, and 0.1/0.036, respectively). In the anesthetized chimpanzee, MK-996 (1 mg/kg, iv) produces 100% (peak) inhibition of the AII pressor response and is still active (52%) at 24 h. To our knowledge this pharmacologic profile in the rat, dog, rhesus monkey, and chimpanzee presents the least species variability of any AII receptor antagonist yet described. Responses to methoxamine and arginine vasopressin are not affected by MK-996. In aortic coarcted (high renin) rats, MK-996 (3 mg/kg, by mouth) reduces blood pressure to normotensive (< 120 mm Hg) levels without reflex tachycardia. This dose of MK-996 reduces blood pressure to approximately the same level as both losartan (3 mg/kg, by mouth) and enalapril (3 mg/kg, by mouth) in this model. The duration of antihypertensive activity of MK-996 is similar to enalapril and shorter than losartan at the doses tested. Additionally, in the rat MK-996 does not potentiate the vasodepressor response to bradykinin and completely prevents the ability of AII to stimulate an increase in plasma levels of aldosterone. Therefore, MK-996 is a potent, orally active, nonpeptide AII receptor antagonist with a long duration of action, little species variability, and anti-hypertensive activity.", 
    "250": "The aim of this study was to compare the renal effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with calcium channel blockade in a model combining genetic hypertension with diabetes. Streptozotocin diabetes was induced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The animals were then randomized to receive no treatment, the ACE inhibitor, perindopril, or the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist lacidipine. Body weight, systolic blood pressure, glycemic control, renal function, and albumin excretion rate (AER) were assessed serially over the 32-week study period. At week 32 the animals were killed and glomerular volume was measured. Both antihypertensive regimens significantly reduced systolic blood pressure in diabetic SHR. There was no significant difference in glycemic control, serum creatinine, or glomerular filtration rate among the three groups at week 32. The ACE inhibitor perindopril significantly reduced AER and glomerular hypertrophy over the 32 weeks, whereas the calcium antagonist lacidipine failed to reduce AER or glomerular hypertrophy. Thus, in contrast to the effects of ACE inhibition, calcium channel blockade with lacidipine, despite significantly reducing blood pressure, failed to reduce renal injury in this model. These results support the hypothesis that antihypertensive regimens may differ in their capacity to protect the diabetic kidney, despite similar effects on systemic blood pressure.",

The untreated essential hypertensive patients had significantly higher chylomicron fraction concentration curves (AUC 17,469 +/- 2553 micrograms/L/h) P < .001 compared with the control group (AUC 13,208 +/- 1245 micrograms/L/h), by two-way analysis of variance with repeated measurements. After 3 months of captopril therapy, the chylomicron fraction (AUC 9701 +/- 1566 micrograms/L/h), and chylomicron remnants fraction (AUC 3487 +/- 580 micrograms/L/h) were much lower (P < .001) than before captopril therapy. Oral glucose tolerance tests were borderline in five of the eight hypertensives before captopril treatment but returned to normal after 3 months of therapy. In summary, postprandial intestinal-derived lipoprotein metabolism is altered in essential hypertensive patients. Captopril therapy caused significant improvement in the postprandial chylomicron metabolism.", 
    "253": "The pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy in chronic uremia is poorly understood. In the present study, the long-term effects of chronic uremia on cardiac morphology and various cysteine proteinases of the heart were investigated in rats with and without antihypertensive therapy by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or by the calcium channel blocker verapamil. 16 weeks after subtotal nephrectomy considerable uremia had developed associated with arterial hypertension, rise in heart weight and heart weight/body weight ratio. Morphologically myocardial cells developed marked hypertrophy. Determination of various cysteine proteinases by fluorometry revealed a significant decline of cathepsin B activity while the activities of cathepsin H and L were unchanged. Antihypertensive treatment with enalapril and verapamil normalized the blood pressure and improved renal function significantly. Myocardial cell hypertrophy and the enhanced heart weight/body weight ratio were normalized under treatment with enalapril but not with verapamil. Simultaneously, the impaired cathepsin B activity returned to the normal range after enalapril treatment. It is concluded that the cardiac hypertrophy in uremia is at least partly caused by an activation of the circulating and/or cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Impaired proteinase activity in the uremic state may be involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "254": "Recent studies on the nature of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in animals have led to the concept that systemic and intrarenal RAS can be influenced to different degrees by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Assessment of efficacy of intrarenal ACE inhibition by ACE inhibitors in humans is necessarily indirect and has not been reported. We therefore monitored the renal response to acute angiotensin (Ang) I infusion in volunteers taking 20 mg enalapril twice daily, and related the responses to the obtained increments in plasma Ang II levels. Ang I infusion rates of 4, 8, 16, and 32 pmol/kg/min caused gradual increments in plasma Ang I (maximal change from 26 +/- 18 to 578 +/- 120 pmol/liter, P < 0.05) and, despite treatment with enalapril, also of Ang II (from 3 +/- 1 to 29 +/- 5 pmol/liter, P < 0.05). This was associated with large reductions in renal plasma flow (paraaminohippurate clearance), filtration fraction, maximal urine flow, sodium excretion, lithium and uric acid clearance, and increments in mean arterial pressure and plasma aldosterone (P < 0.05 for each variable). Strong correlations existed between the changes in either variable and the increment in plasma Ang II. Infusions of Ang II at 1 and 4 pmol/kg/min in the same subjects caused comparable increments in plasma Ang II and had similar physiological effects as found during the Ang I infusion. Analysis of covariance of the changes in plasma Ang II and each of the measured variables revealed no differences between Ang I and Ang II infusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Fourteen type I diabetic patients (mean age 45 +/- 9.5 years, mean duration of diabetes 23.5 +/- 7.3 years, 8 males/6 females) with glomerular filtration rate < 70 ml/min-1/1.73 m2 and albumin excretion rate > 30 micrograms/min were treated intensively for 36 months. This intensive treatment consisted of multiple insulin injections, antihypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors and a low-protein diet (0.8 g/kg body wt/day.) Renal function was evaluated as GFR and AER. HbA1c mean value decreased significantly from 8.7 +/- 0.8% to 6.5 +/- 0.5% (P < 0.0002). GFR rose from 58 +/- 12 ml/min-1/1.73 m2 to 84 +/- 11 ml/min-1/1.73 m2 (P < 0.0008). AER decreased from 208 micrograms/min (range: 73 to 500) to 63.8 micrograms/min (range 15 to 180; P < 0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased respectively from 144 +/- 26 mm Hg to 120 +/- 15 mm Hg and from 89 +/- 9 mm Hg to 75 +/- 8 mm Hg (P < 0.01). We obtained a rise of GFR and a reduction of proteinuria after three years of this treatment. We suggest that this intensive treatment in all patients with early stage diabetic nephropathy may be effective in slowing the progression to renal failure.",

Venous compliance was not different between the two borderline hypertensive groups and was only slightly lesser than in controls. Large artery compliance was studied using a non-invasive ultrasound vessel wall movement detector system, while venous compliance was determined by means of strain gauge plethysmography. The borderline hypertensive subjects were subsequently treated with enalapril 10 mg/day, felodipine 5 mg/day or placebo during six months. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, enalapril induced a significant increase of the muscular femoral and brachial artery compliance, but not of the elastic carotid artery, while felodipine did not influence large artery compliance at all in the sodium-sensitive group. The effect of enalapril on muscular artery compliance was established through a dose-dependent increase in distension and not through a change in arterial diameter. Arterial compliance was not influenced by either of the drugs in the resistant group. Venous compliance was also not altered by the medication. In conclusion, femoral and brachial artery compliance in sodium-sensitive borderline hypertensive subjects, which was found to be lower than that of sodium-resistant subjects, improved with antihypertensive treatment with enalapril but not with felodipine, despite the similar reductions in blood pressure induced by both drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "257": "A recent meta-analysis of hypertension treatment trials demonstrated a marked reduction in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease, but a less pronounced reduction in coronary heart disease. Treatment consisted mainly of diuretics and beta-blockers, and this paper discusses the possible influences of their metabolic side effects on coronary risk factors compared with newer agents: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Several studies are underway to compare the effect of these compounds with diuretics and beta-blockers with respect to long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Until the results of these studies are available, young patients (i.e. < 60-65 years) at high risk of coronary heart disease, especially patients with the insulin resistance syndrome or diabetes mellitus, should in our opinion be treated with ACE-inhibitors, selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors or calcium channel blockers.", 
    "258": "Experience is presented from clinical trials conducted during the development of cilazapril (CLZ) for the treatment of hypertension, in which hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was added to the treatment regimen in patients whose blood pressures did not normalize [sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) < or = 90 mm Hg] in response to CLZ alone. In 906 mild-to-moderate hypertensives (SDBP = 95-114 mm Hg), adjunct therapy with 12.5-25 mg HCTZ added to 5 mg CLZ provided an additional 3-9 mm Hg reduction in SDBP and increased the normalization rate by 13-27%. Additional efficacy of the combination occurred without any compromise in safety (assessed in 1,189 mild-to-moderate and 99 severe hypertensives and in 9 normal healthy volunteers). Long-term treatment with CLZ and adjunctive HCTZ was well tolerated. The majority of clinical and laboratory adverse events were mild to moderate and not serious; only 5.7% of the mild-to-moderate hypertensives and 3.3% of the severe hypertensives withdrew from the studies due to adverse events and/or intercurrent illness. Therefore, given that the addition of HCTZ to CLZ appears to improve efficacy with no additional safety risk, combining CLZ with HCTZ appears to be a rational clinical choice for patients whose blood pressures do not normalize on CLZ monotherapy.",

One hundred thirty-seven patients enrolled from January 1989 to December 1991 were treated conventionally with digoxin, furosemide, and low dose angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Patients refractory to this therapy underwent urgent heart transplantation. Ninety-nine patients enrolled from January 1992 to August 1993 underwent staged therapy: stage 1: maximal tolerated ACE inhibition; stage 2: therapy with PGE1 for pre- and afterload reduction to achieve hemodynamic stabilization; or stage 3: refractory patients bridged to heart transplantation with continuous outpatient dobutamine. Sudden death was defined as death within 1 hour of symptoms if heart failure symptoms remained stable over the previous 7 days. Conventionally treated patients were followed for 10 +/- 9 months; patients who underwent staged therapy for 9 +/- 5 months. In the group of patients that underwent standard therapy, 39 of 137 (28%) patients died: 5 (13%) deaths occurred suddenly, and death due to progressive pump failure occurred in the remaining 34 (87%) patients.

Of the 1,145 men aged 70-84 years alive in 1991, 834 participated in a study carried out by Hjartnavernd, the Heart Association. A history of hypertension or the presence of high blood pressure when measured at the Associations institute were found in 429 men, of whom 157 were on medication for hypertension alone: 95 on single drug treatment, 49 on two drugs, and five on three drugs, no information being available for the remaining eight. The most widely used drugs were diuretics or beta-blockers, of which diuretics apparently yielded better results. Of combined regiments, that of beta-blockers and diuretics was by far the most common, followed by ACE- (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and diuretics, and beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Thus, both medical and economic factors suggest that diuretics should be used in this age group.", 
    "261": "The objective of this trial was to determine the long-term antiproteinuric effect of a low-dose of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN), stable renal function, and no indicators of poor long-term prognosis. Fourteen adult IMN outpatients (median age 53 years) with a median duration of disease of 3 years received 12.5 mg of captopril twice a day for 12 months in a prospective trial. The effects of therapy were evaluated on the basis of plasma creatinine, 24-h proteinuria, the proteinuria selectivity index, albuminaemia, and serum IgG levels. Data were compared by means of the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test. Three patients withdrew from the trial. Renal function remained stable in the 11 who completed the study. A clear decrease in proteinuria was observed after 1 month of therapy, which persisted with time and was associated with a trend towards a further long-term decrease. An increase in serum albumin was only observed after 6 months of therapy, again with a trend towards an increase over time. Serum IgG levels increased during therapy. This study together with data from the literature suggests a potential long-term benefit of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in moderately proteinuric IMN. Prospective trials comparing low-dose and high-dose ACEI to no treatment or a placebo in non-severe IMN are now required.", 
    "262": "We studied the effect of aging on cardiac hypertrophy and action potential duration (APD) in normotensive male WAG/Rij rats and evaluated the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in these effects. Cardiac hypertrophy occurs in 30-month-old rats, as indicated by an increase in heart weight, and APD gradually increases with aging in the epicardial region of the right and the left ventricle. Short-term treatment (1 month) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril prevented age-related increase in heart weight/body weight ratio independent of its antihypertensive effects, but did not prevent changes in APD in 30-month-old rats. Our results show a dissociation of changes in cardiac mass from changes in APD during aging. The effect of ACEI on hypertrophy may be due in part to a direct angiotensin effect on cellular growth. Changes in APD are not related to hypertrophy but rather to the process of aging.", 
    "263": "To elucidate the roles of endogenous angiotensin II (AII) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in modulation of renal blood flow (RBF), we recorded RBF and RSNA in conscious two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive rabbits with blood pressure (BP) reduced to a similar extent by captopril (5 mg/kg) and nicardipine (4.3 micrograms/kg/min). We measured plasma concentrations of AII, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and norepinephrine (NE). Despite comparable depressor effects, changes in RBF showed different profiles with the two drugs in renal hypertensive rabbits. After captopril injection, RBF was consistently increased to 143 +/- 7%. In contrast, with nicardipine infusion, RBF was initially increased to 114 +/- 5% and then significantly decreased to 86 +/- 4%. The increase in RSNA was greater with captopril than with nicardipine. Plasma concentration of AII was decreased with captopril but significantly increased with nicardipine. In sham-clipped normotensive rabbits in which plasma AII was not increased, RBF was not reduced with nicardipine. Thus, vasoconstrictor actions of RSNA and increased AII may have overcome the vasodilatory effect of nicardipine in conscious renal hypertensive rabbits. Because the increase in RSNA was smaller with nicardipine, we speculate that the vasoconstriction induced by AII, as well as background BP level, played a substantial role in determining RBF.", 
    "264": "Spirapril is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a long duration of action. To determine whether duration of inhibition of serum ACE activity may affect regional blood flow (RBF), we compared spirapril with captopril, an ACE inhibitor with a short duration of action. Both the short- and long-term effects were studied in patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF). Calf, renal, and hepatic BF measurements were performed in the morning before intake of the study medication; 24 h after the previous dose of spirapril (n = 9 patients) and 12 h after the previous dose of captopril (n = 9 patients). Serum ACE activity after 1, 6, and 12 weeks was significantly reduced in patients receiving spirapril, but not in those receiving captopril. The decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was more pronounced in the spirapril group. Calf BF showed a slight but not significant increase in both spirapril- and captopril-treated patients. Effective renal BF increased significantly only in patients treated with spirapril. Although filtration fraction (FF) tended to decrease in the spirapril group, the decrease was significant only in the captopril group. No changes were observed in hepatic BF. Cerebral BF (CBF) measurements were performed after intake of the first dose of study medication and after 12 weeks, immediately after drug intake. Significant reduction in MAP in the two treatment groups both after the first dose and after 12 weeks did not affect CBF. Despite a significantly prolonged decrease in MAP and serum ACE activity in spirapril-treated patients, no marked differences in RBF were noted between the two ACE inhibitors.", 
    "265": "In end-stage heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy beta 1-adrenoceptors are downregulated and Gi alpha-proteins are upregulated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on beta-adrenoceptor density and Gi alpha-proteins in sequential endomyocardial biopsies. Nineteen patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA Class II-III) were studied before and after 8-11 weeks of therapy. Patients were randomised into a captopril and a control group; 9 patients received captopril 12.5-50 mg per day, (divided in 2-3 doses) p.o. in addition to \"conventional\" therapy with digoxin and diuretics, and 10 controls received \"conventional\" therapy only. Echocardiography, spiroergometry, right heart catheterisation and endomyocardial biopsies were performed before (baseline) and after treatment. Compared to baseline, captopril increased total beta-adrenoceptor density by selectively increasing beta 1-adrenoceptors (31.6 vs 41.2 fmol.mg-1; p < 0.05) but had no significant effect on Gi alpha-proteins. The results indicate that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors partly restores myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptor density, and this action effect may contribute to the clinical improvement of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy treated in this way.", 
    "266": "Endothelial cells produce a variety of factors involved in the control of vascular tone, platelet activation and cell growth, one of the most important being nitric oxide (NO). Although continuously produced in response to fluid shear stress, the release of NO from these cells can be enhanced further by humoral stimuli, such as bradykinin. This is the result of a chain of complex intracellular events involving changes in Ca2+, pH and protein phosphorylation. Endothelial cells are also capable of synthesizing bradykinin from an endogenous source, the release of which is markedly enhanced under hypoxic conditions. The finding that ACE inhibitors promote the local accumulation of the peptide and increase its efficacy at the receptor level may partly explain the potent anti-ischemic and cardioprotective effects of these drugs.",

Apstatin doubled the maximum blood pressure response to bradykinin. The area under the curve (AUC), which incorporates both peak blood pressure changes and duration of response, was doubled in apstatin-treated rats vs controls and in the apstatin+lisinopril group vs lisinopril alone. These data demonstrate that APP is an important kinase in vivo.",

The basal values for PRA ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.09 ng/ml/hr for males and 1.02 +/- 0.12 ng/ml/hr for females in erect posture. In contrast high basal supine PRA was noticed in subjects on low salt diet, which showed a significant increase in erect posture. A marked decrease in PRA with advancing age in both the sexes with significantly low values at higher age range was noticed. Captopril produced an insignificant effect on PRA and BP in salt replete supine state, whereas in salt deplete state there was a significant rise in both the parameters.",

Its hepatic metabolism and central action explain the absence of rebound effect when treatment is stopped. Urapidil is an arterial and venous vasodilator in systemic and pulmonary circulation. Therefore urapidil decreases systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures and left and right ventricular preload. These effects are accompanied by moderate effects on heart rate, and increased cardiac output in patients with heart failure. Some adverse effects observed with other vasodilators are absent (increased intracranial pressure and intrapulmonary shunt, negative inotropic effect, tachycardia). IV urapidil is used to treat systemic arterial hypertension perioperatively and hypertensive emergencies. Moreover urapidil has been administered to treat pulmonary artery hypertension in chronic pulmonary disease. Its haemodynamic effects seem proportional to the basal activity of alpha-adrenoceptors.

    "288": "By a reciprocal of creatininemia the rate of chronic renal failure progression (CRF) was assessed in 14 patients with nephropathy on enalapril treatment. The day dose ranged from 2.5 to 15 mg. In patients with serum creatinin levels from 0.24 to 0.41 mmol/l (group 1) enalapril significantly inhibited CRF progression, as it did in group 2 (serum creatinin levels from 0.47 to 0.68 mmol/l) but 1 patient. In patients with creatinin levels over 0.71 mmol/l, the influence of enalapril on CRF progression rate was insignificant. All the patients exhibited stabilization of arterial hypertension. Proteinuria diminished in groups 1 and 2, while creatinin clearance decreased in groups 1 and 3. It is inferred that enalapril control of renal function in nephropathy patients is efficient only in early CRF.",

The trial included 345 males with essential hypertension stage I-II by WHO criteria. Evaluable patients after 8 months of treatment comprised 85.8%. 8-month monotherapy with captopril, nifedipine, hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol was completed by 53.49%, 75.28%, 45.78% of patients, respectively. An antihypertensive effect was reached in 57.97% of patients on monotherapy. Normalization of arterial pressure took place in 51.3%. The 4 drugs in the given doses produced a significant and similar effect in relation to the action on arterial pressure (absolute value). As for individual effects (complete and partial), captopril and propranolol were equal, nifedipine was more beneficial than hydrochlorothiazide. Side effects in captopril monotherapy arose 1.5-2 times less frequently than in response to propranolol or nifedipine and were similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "290": "Renovascular hypertension (RVH) remains a leading cause of potentially curable hypertension. Although RVH affects less than 1% of the unselected hypertensive population, between 10% and 35% of appropriately screened patients referred to specialised centres for problematic hypertension may prove to have renovascular disease. Advances in percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) have renewed interest in developing better noninvasive screening tests for identifying patients with potentially correctable hypertension or renal impairment due to renovascular disease caused by either fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) or arteriosclerosis. Duplex ultrasound with the two-dimensional Echo-Colour-Doppler technique for measurements of blood flow velocities in the renal interlobar arteries as expressed in the Pulsatility Index (PI) has been evaluated. Experimentally induced changes in renovascular resistance (RVR) in normotensives and in primary hypertensives were registered noninvasively by means of PI-measurements. A significant correlation between the absolute values of PI and RVR was found in hypertensives (r = 0.50, p < 0.002), but not in normotensives. In both groups, the changes of RVR due to angiotensin II infusion and ACE-inhibition were significantly correlated to the changes in PI (normotensives: r = 0.69, p < 0.001, primary hypertensives: r = 0.64, p < 0.001). Normally, the blood flow velocities as expressed by the PI in the renal vasculature of the two kidneys are equal. In hypertensive patients, PI was lower in kidneys with significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) than in kidneys without RAS (p < 0.001). Doppler signals were absent in all kidneys with renal artery occlusion. A bilateral low PI combined with normal side difference in PI may in hypertensive patients indicate bilateral RAS. RVH was correctly diagnosed in 84% of the patients and the presence of RAS in 94%. Provocative testing of an activated renin-angiotensin system by means of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) constitutes the foundation for screening for RVH using gamma camera renography with 99mTc-DTPA as a glomerular filtration marker. In 20 consecutive patients with successfully treated RVH, one-third of the patients were not correctly diagnosed using ACEI-enhanced 99mTc-DTPA gamma camera renography, which indicates that some patients with RVH have compensatory mechanisms to maintain GFR after ACE inhibition. The relationship between the renin-angiotensin system and erythropoietin (EPO) production was studied in 20 patients with RAS and hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

It differs from typical atherosclerosis in that intimal hyperplasia is concentric and diffuse, the internal elastic lamina remains intact, calcification is rare, and the disease tends to develop rapidly. Intravascular ultrasound and coronary angioscopy are more sensitive diagnostic measures of cardiac allograft vasculopathy than is coronary angiography. Although retransplantation at present seems to be the only definitive therapy for cardiac allograft vasculopathy, it has shown only fair results. Recent studies have suggested that calcium entry blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may play a beneficial role in delaying the progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.",

Of them 45 patients received Capoten, 12 patients Renitek. ACE inhibitors were examined for effects on arterial pressure, proteinuria, renal and intrarenal hemodynamics. A hypotensive effect was apparent in hypertension and minimal in normotension. One month later renal bloodflow increased, glomerular filtration rate did not change. ACE inhibitors proved able to correct intrarenal hypertension: renal functional reserve returned to normal on posttreatment month 1-3 in 10 of 16 patients.

The present study assesses the hemodynamic effects of a CEI (enalaprilat 1 mg/kg; n = 9), a NEPI (retrothiorphan 25 mg/kg + 25 mg/kg/h; n = 9) and the combination (CEI+NEPI; n = 9) versus a control group (n = 9) in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. CEI alone induced a significant hypotensive effect due to a decrease (-35.1%) in total peripheral resistance (TPR), with no significant increase in cardiac output (CO). NEPI alone had a slight hypotensive effect due to a small decrease in CO. CEI+NEPI decreased the mean arterial pressure to the same extent (-26.7%) as the CEI-induced hypotensive effect, decreased TPR (-44.4%) and induced an increase in CO (+38.2%) with an increase in heart rate. In summary, NEPI combined with CEI induces large decreases in blood pressure and in TPR which do not significantly differ from the CEI-induced effects. It also induces increases in heart rate and in cardiac output in anesthetized SHR.",

    "295": "Anaphylactoid reactions have been observed in patients treated with AN69 dialysers and ACE inhibitors. Recently, it has been shown in vitro that AN69 membranes induce the release of high amounts of bradykinin in plasma. To verify the possible role of bradykinin in these shock-like reactions, six sheep were dialysed in a random fashion using AN69 or the new SPAN membrane with and without pretreatment with captopril. All animals were dialysed for 60 min via double-lumen Shaldon catheters. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min from the venous line. A total of 24 haemodialysis procedures was carried out: group A (n = 6), AN69 without captopril; group B (n = 6), SPAN without captopril; group C (n = 6), AN69 with captopril; group D (n = 6), SPAN with captopril. A significant bradykinin release was observed only in groups A and C, reaching peak values already after 5 min. Animals in group C showed the highest bradykinin values. In four of six animals in group C anaphylactoid reactions with severe hypotension were noted. From this animal model we conclude that dialysis with the AN69 membrane is associated with bradykinin release. Pretreatment with ACE inhibitors results in further increasing bradykinin levels, which lead to anaphylactoid reactions. In contrast, the new SPAN membrane was well tolerated without detectable changes in bradykinin concentrations.",

To test whether the combination of both may have an additive antiproteinuric effect, we studied the effects of single treatment with ACEi (10 mg enalapril o.d.), LPD (target, 50% reduction in protein intake), and the combination of both in 14 of such patients with stable proteinuria exceeding 3 g per day. Baseline measurements were performed while patients were on a normal protein diet (NPD). In group A (n = 7), first the effects of a LPD were investigated, whereafter the effects of addition of ACEi to LPD were studied. In group B (n = 7), first the effects of ACEi were investigated, whereafter the effects of addition of a LPD to ACEi were studied. Each treatment period lasted 2 months. LPD decreased proteinuria with 17% in patients without ACEi treatment (group A), and similarly with 19% in patients with ACEi treatment (group B). The antiproteinuric response obtained with the LPD in individual patients ranged from -63% to +1%. This variation is at least partly explained by interindividual differences in diet compliance, since the antiproteinuric effect of the LPD was found to correlate with the achieved reduction in protein intake (r = 0.58, P < 0.05). ACEi lowered proteinuria with 32% during the NPD (group B), and similarly with 43% during the LPD (group A).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Renal biopsies, obtained in 5 cases, showed focal glomerulosclerosis in 2 cases, minimal changes in 2 and mesangial proliferation in 1. Nine patients (group 1) were treated with hypocaloric diets; body weight significantly decreased (BMI 37.1 +/- 3, 34 +/- 3.5 and 32.6 +/- 3.2 at 0, 6 and 12 months, respectively) as well as proteinuria (2.9 +/- 1.7, 1.2 +/- 1 and 0.4 +/- 0.6 g/24 h). There was a significant correlation between body weight loss and decrease in proteinuria (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Eight patients (group 2) were treated with captopril, without dietary changes. BMI remained stable but proteinuria showed a dramatic decrease, similar to that in group 1 (3.4 +/- 1.7, 1.2 +/- 0.9 and 0.7 +/- 1 g/24 h, respectively). Renal function remained stable in both groups. In summary, both body weight loss and captopril treatment can induce a sharp decrease in obesity-related proteinuria.", 
    "298": "Angiotensin II causes pulmonary vasoconstriction in man and in animals, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have prevented the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension in animals models. Angiotensin II may contribute to lung vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertensive disease, since cilazapril, an inhibitor of ACE, reduces pulmonary vascular medical thickening in chronically hypoxic rats with established pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, the ACE DD genotype, which has been associated with increased circulating and tissue ACE activity, has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in human hypertensive disorders. The ACE DD genotype may also 'permit' a greater hypertrophic adaptation of the pressure-over-loaded right ventricle. In fact, we have shown that pulmonary hypertension patients with maintained cardiac output and less right-heart failure fall into the group with the DD genotype and that patients with a low cardiac output and more severe right-heart failure fall into the group with the non-DD genotype, supporting the hypothesis. We assessed cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in patients with primary (unexplained) pulmonary hypertension and segregated the patients based on their ACE genotype. For similar mean pulmonary artery pressures in the DD and non-DD groups, the cardiac output was substantially lower in the patients with the non-DD genotype, whereas the values for mean right atrial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were double when compared with the DD group. Our data show that the ACE DD genotype is prevalent in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and is a marker of maintained right ventricular function.", 
    "299": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) have been shown to be effective in improving symptoms and survival in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Despite their proven benefits the use of ACE inhibitors is still limited in many parts of the western world. In part, the underutilization of ACE inhibitors is due to the occurrence of side effects such as cough, renal dysfunction and first dose hypotension. These side effects are in part due to ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin formation. Blockade of the effects of angiotensin II can however also be achieved with an angiotensin II type I receptor blocking agent such as losartan. To determine the relative safety and effectiveness of ACE inhibitors compared to an angiotensin II type I receptor blocking agent the evaluation of losartan and the elderly trial (Elite) is comparing the ACE inhibitor captopril to the angiotensin II type I receptor blocking agent losartan in elderly patients. When used ACE inhibitors are often given in doses lower than those shown to be effective in reducing mortality in the major randomized trials. Several trials are currently under way comparing low to high doses of ACE inhibitors which should provide information on the need to achieve the doses used in the major mortality studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The majority were New York Heart Association functional class II (56-62%), and the most frequent etiology of chronic heart failure was coronary heart disease (35-42%), followed by dilative cardiomyopathy (approximately 28%). Both ACE inhibitors prolonged the exercise tolerance test duration at all visits, and the effect at week 12 (CLZ 62.2 +/- 7.5 s; CPT 73.1 +/- 10.7 s) was significantly greater than after PLA (28.1 +/- 12.2 s; p = 0.011 and p = 0.005, respectively).

This has been most extensively studied in patients with diabetic nephropathy and, to some extent, with other forms of renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. This important aspect of antihypertensive treatment has not been studied previously in patients with essential hypertension. Preliminary results regarding the effects of two different antihypertensive therapies on the loss of GFR with time, determined with 51Cr-EDTA clearance after 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment, are presented here. The GFR was assessed in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension. All had a normal renal function, and none had diabetes mellitus or glucosuria. The two therapeutic modalities were the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent atenolol. Both therapies were equally effective in lowering the systolic blood pressure. However, atenolol was slightly but significantly more effective in lowering the diastolic blood pressure after 6, 12, and 24 months. The decline in GFR with time was significantly smaller with cilazapril than with atenolol. After 6 months, the reduction in GFR was 1.0 (cilazapril) vs. 4.0 (atenolol) ml/min x 1.73 m2 (p < 0.01). After 12 months the corresponding changes were 2.0 vs. 4.5 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (p < 0.05) and after 24 months 3.0 vs. 4.0 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (n.s.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "302": "In its classical definition, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) acts predominantly by endocrine mechanisms. This view has been modified since several components of the RAS and their mRNAs were found in peripheral tissues. These findings gave rise to the concept of local tissue renin-angiotensin systems. Although no cells of cardiovascular organs containing a complete RAS have been identified as of this writing, angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are most likely synthesized within the vasculature for example. Local synthesis of renin may be limited to very small amounts, but uptake of renin from the circulation is very likely. The function of local RASs is shown by reduction of blood pressure by ACE inhibitors, which correlates better with the inhibition of ACE activity in certain tissues than with its activity in the plasma. Further studies have put forward the notion that the circulating RAS could mainly be important for acute hemodynamic stability, whereas the tissue RAS could be involved in more long term maintenance of hemodynamics. This review will try to summarize the findings leading to the concept of a local tissue renin-angiotensin system, and discuss interactions between the circulating and the local RAS in the light of recent experimental findings.", 
    "303": "Studies on the effect of antihypertensive agents on resistance arteries in hypertensive patients have in the past yielded inconclusive results regarding the ability of these drugs to induce a regression toward normal of either the structure or the function of these critically important vessels. We have recently compared the effects of the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and of the beta blocker atenolol on the structure and the function of subcutaneous resistance arteries of essential hypertensive patients. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cilazapril or atenolol for a period of 2 years. The blood pressure was normalized for the duration of the trial by both drugs. The media-to-lumen ratio of resistance arteries, which was significantly increased in all hypertensive patients before starting treatment, was normalized by the 2-year treatment with cilazapril, whereas treatment with atenolol did not result in any change in this vascular parameter. Treatment with cilazapril also returned to normal the contractile responses to several vasoconstrictors, particularly endothelin 1. Endothelium-dependent relaxation responses of blood vessels to acetylcholine were abnormal in hypertensive patients and improved in the cilazapril-treated patients, but remained unchanged in the atenolol-treated ones. We conclude that treatment with the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril corrects in part the vascular remodeling and the functional abnormalities of resistance arteries of hypertensive patients, whereas treatment with the beta blocker atenolol does not. These results may indicate that treatment with cilazapril and perhaps with other angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors as well may improve the clinical outcome in hypertension by inducing a regression of abnormal resistance vessel structure and function.", 
    "304": "Captopril renography was utilized to assess the presence of angiotensin II dependent renovascular dysfunction in (1) 28 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH) with unimpaired renal function, and (2) 25 hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy (HDN). These studies were classified according to the diagnostic criteria outlined by the Working Party on Diagnostic Criteria of Renovascular Hypertension with Captopril Renography and the mean parenchymal transit time (MPTT) was used as an index for detecting the presence of angiotensin II dependent renal haemodynamic change. Patients with EH showed non-significant or non-specific alterations in the MPTT. Four patients in the HDN group showed a significant prolongation of MPTT in the presence of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activation due to renal artery stenosis, and the other patients in this group showed a significant decrease in MPTT after captopril, consistent with increased blood flow and improved tubular transport function in the presence of microangiopathy only. We conclude that addition of MPTT to the standard diagnostic criteria of captopril renography may be helpful in predicting the beneficial or detrimental impact of angiotensin II inhibition treatment in HDN and in limiting the test protocol in EH to one post-captopril study.",

    "306": "Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the isolation and sequencing of a novel bradykinin-potentiating peptide, generated by tryptic hydrolysis of the gamma-casein chain. No homology was found to other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides. The octapeptide Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe-Thr-Glu, corresponding to the gamma-casein(114-121) sequence, was isolated from the tryptic hydrolysis of gamma-casein and also synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Both natural and synthetic peptides had the same retention time in HPLC and displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea-pig ileum for bradykinin and Lys-bradykinin but were not able to potentiate the effects of Met-Lys-bradykinin, Ile-Ser-bradykinin, angiotensin II, acetylcholine, or histamine. Intravenous injections of bradykinin and of bradykinin-potentiating octapeptide produced a persistent hypotension in conscious rats, a pattern that was not obtained when the octapeptide was replaced by captopril. This bradykinin-potentiating octapeptide is a strong competitive inhibitor of endo-oligopeptidase A (EC 3.4.24.15, formerly EC 3.4.22.19), but it has low inhibitory potency towards angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1). Thus, our results suggest that other peptidases in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme, such as endo-oligopeptidase A, may contribute to the reduction of the effective concentration of bradykinin in the circulation.",

Plasma neurohormones were studied in 55 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II, noradrenaline and ANP were elevated in the early phase but tended to normalize during the first week in patients without signs of heart failure. In patients with heart failure angiotensin II and noradrenaline remained elevated for 1 month and ANP for 4-6 months. During head-up tilt, angiotensin II and noradrenaline increased most in patients with heart failure. In patients with a first myocardial infarction there was a positive correlation between sustained neurohormonal activity and infarct size. Almost complete suppression of plasma ACE activity was achieved within 30 min in 48 patients treated with intravenous enalaprilat, initiated within 24 h from the onset of infarction. The drug was tolerated in dosages of 1.0-1.2 mg given over 1-2h. Patients with systolic blood pressure between 100 and 110 mmHg incurred a greater risk of hypotension than those with higher blood pressure at baseline. Tolerance was not worse among patients treated with intravenous diuretics, metoprolol or nitroglycerin. A total of 98 patients were randomized to treatment with enalapril or placebo, initiated within 24 h from onset of infarction and continued for 4-6 months. During treatment there were no significant differences in plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, ANP or catecholamines between groups. Echocardiographic recordings were performed in 28 patients. Among patients on placebo there was a positive correlation between plasma levels of noradrenaline at days 5-7 and the increase in left ventricular volumes during the study period, and an inverse correlation between plasma aldosterone at days 5-7 and the increase in left ventricular ejection fraction during the study. No such correlation was found among patients on enalapril. ANP levels at 1 month correlated inversely with the left ventricular ejection fraction at the same time. Plasma neurohormones were measured in 223 patients with mild or moderately severe chronic heart failure, randomized to treatment with ramipril or placebo for 3 months. There was wide variation in hormone levels. Noradrenaline and aldosterone correlated inversely with exercise duration at baseline. Noradrenaline correlated positively with the degree of symptoms.

    "308": "Plasma and vascular kinins stimulate the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, prostacyclin and hyperpolarizing factor (which regulates the function of vascular smooth muscle), and endothelial interactions with blood cells. The role of kinins in vasomotion is determined by the rate of production of the peptides by kininogenases and their degradation by kininases, in particular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Acute increases in plasma kinin levels during exercise or myocardial ischemia indicate that the metabolism of the peptides is fine tuned to the systemic or local metabolic demands. The release of endothelial vasodilators is impaired (or counterbalanced by the release of chemical or functional antagonists) in atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, subarachidonic hemorrhage, and following postischemic injury. ACE-inhibitors potentiate the action of kinins and normalize endothelial function. In septic shock, hypotension triggered by overproduction of kinins leads to cardiovascular impairment and end-organ damage. Thus the balance in the metabolism of kinins modulates the control of blood flow by the endothelium.", 
    "309": "Cardiovascular diseases involve changes in the structure of the heart and blood vessels. Normal structure is maintained by a sophisticated set of mechanical and cellular \"checks and balances.\" A disturbance of these checks and balances induces a remodeling process. The most distinguished features of this process are phenotypic modulation of various cell types in the cardiovascular system; cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy; and extracellular matrix production, deposition, and degradation. Optimal pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases should be aimed at correcting structural abnormalities in the heart and blood vessels. This goal can be achieved by influencing mechanical stresses on the cardiovascular system or by interfering with the chemical mediators of the remodeling process. Many existing groups of cardiovascular drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-antagonists, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and antithrombotic drugs, influence cardiovascular remodeling. New approaches involve the development of drugs acting on peptidergic mediators of cardiovascular remodeling.",

The recognition that the process of ventricular enlargement following myocardial infarction is modifiable provided the initial rationale for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as therapy to prevent deterioration in ventricular size and function following infarction. Experimental and clinical studies have documented the effectiveness of this therapy in preventing this late enlargement following infarction. Increasing clinical evidence indicates that this new use of ACE inhibitor therapy in survivors of acute myocardial infarction will lead to an improvement in clinical outcome.",

The aim of this prospective work was to study the mechanisms involved in the correction of hyponatremia in 6 patients aged 52-69 years with CHF and hyponatremia (serum sodium 125-128 mmol/l) who were receiving digitalis and furosemide. In these patients, captopril was introduced in progressively increasing doses. The drug induced significant clinical improvement. Additionally, a statistically significant increase in serum sodium was observed which was correlated to a rise in the diluting ability of the kidney (increase in CeH2O). A slight increase in creatinine clearance was also found, which could have contributed to the improvement in hyponatremia. Therefore, we conclude that ACE inhibitors can improve hyponatremia in CHF patients by increasing the urinary diluting ability.", 
    "313": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was carried out to evaluate the short-term effects of captopril on exercise tolerance in 18 normotensive patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and normal left ventricular function. Captopril 25 mg (or placebo) was given twice, i.e. in the evening (10 p.m.) and the following morning (8 a.m.), prior to a maximal symptom-limited bicycle exercise test (11 a.m.). Captopril reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest (p < 0.01) without causing any reflex tachycardia. The time to onset of S-T depression was prolonged (p < 0.05), and the maximal S-T depression was reduced (p < 0.02). No differences were found between captopril and placebo in total exercise duration or time to onset of angina. The effects of captopril on exercise-induced ischemia were demonstrated most clearly in patients who responded with a greater than 10 mm Hg fall in the resting systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, this study suggests that captopril has anti-ischemic properties, which may be of importance in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina and normal left ventricular function. These beneficial effects probably relate to a reduction in afterload and myocardial wall stress and therefore a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "314": "Previous studies have indicated that the hypertension that develops after unilateral arterial constriction (2 kidney, 1 clip) involves an active participation by the non-clipped contralateral kidney. Even though the non-clipped kidney is not the initial causative factors, and despite the progressive renin depletion during the early weeks following clipping, the non-clipped kidney is highly responsive to angiotensin blockers. Furthermore, the non-clipped kidney has augmented tissue ANG II levels and ACE activity suggesting that some renin-independent mechanism may be stimulating intrarenal ANG II formation. This model has been simulated by infusing ANG II at low subpressor doses (40 ng/min) to uninephrectomized rats for 14 days. With this model, plasma and renal renin levels are markedly suppressed; however, the renal ANG II levels are increased to levels above those that can be explained on the basis of circulating ANG II. In agreement with the responses observed in the non-clipped kidney of 2K1C rats, there is also an increased renal ACE activity. In contrast to the marked suppression of renin gene expression and renin activity, angiotensinogen gene expression is not suppressed. These results support the hypothesis that small elevations in circulating ANG II stimulate intrarenal ANG II production through a renin-independent mechanism.", 
    "315": "In chronic hypertension, vascular resistance is raised and there is concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, at least in animal models. Together these changes enhance hemodynamic performance (\"amplifier\" properties) and help maintain elevated blood pressure (BP) and net microcirculatory exchange. Sometimes there is vascular \"remodelling\", with only luminal narrowing, but no net increase in medial mass. This can be related to non-uniform distribution of wall stress: when the amount of hypertrophy normalizes average wall stress, that on luminal side tends to be undercorrected accounting for preferential growth in that direction, whilst stress on the adventitial side is overcorrected, which results in a tendency to reabsorb material. In Goldblatt hypertension, about 20% of the rise in BP is due to the renal artery stenosis resistance, with the rest differing during the early and late phases: the early contribution is due to angiotensin II (AngII)-mediated systemic constriction and subtle fluid volume changes, whilst later on the cardiovascular amplifiers take over many of the actions of AngII. In SHR, trophic sympathetic nervous system actions are crucial for the rise in BP and development of structural changes and both contribute to the elevation of BP. Neonatal sympathectomy + prazosin treatment prevents hypertension and structural changes in SHR. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a similar role in cardiovascular development in SHR and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Prolonged administration of ACE inhibitors to SHR produces long term attenuation of hypertension because of an impaired capacity for cardiovascular development in adult animals. In human hypertension, long term treatment with common antihypertensive drugs is required to produce substantial regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy. Since it imposes marked non-uniformity on the distribution of capillary blood flow, with the potential for rarefaction and organ damage, therapy aimed at regression of hypertrophy is a worthwhile target.", 
    "316": "The declining mortality due to coronary heart disease and stroke has been attributed in part to improved effectiveness and application of antihypertensive therapy and the successful identification and treatment of the population at risk. In striking contrast, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) attributed to hypertension has increased annually for the last decade and will probably worsen at least through the year 2000. Taken together, patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients with hypertensive renal disease account for the majority of new cases annually. The reasons for the striking dissociation between our success with coronary heart disease and stroke on the one hand and our inability to lessen the incidence of ESRD on the other remain to be clarified. Evidence reveals that all levels of untreated hypertension are associated with potentially declining renal function. Data from the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and other studies suggest that antihypertensive treatment can prevent or retard development of progressive renal failure. Although the importance of blood pressure control is implicit, a theoretic framework based on data derived from experimental animal suggests that ACE-inhibitors and perhaps calcium antagonists may exert specific renoprotective effects beyond those achieved by blood pressure reduction per se. The results of recent long-term prospective studies are consistent with such a formulation. In view of the increasing importance of ACE-inhibitors and calcium antagonists in the antihypertensive armamentarium, additional prospective randomized studies are required to delineate further the effects of these agents on the progression of chronic renal insufficiency.", 
    "317": "Adriamycin, a commonly used antineoplastic antibiotic, induces glomerular lesions in rats, resulting in persistent proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. We studied the effects of dietary protein and of an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor on the progression of this nephropathy and the evolution of the histological lesions, as well as mesangial macromolecule flow. Adriamycin nephropathy was induced by injecting a single iv dose of adriamycin (3 mg/kg body weight) into the tail vein of male Wistar rats (weight, 180-200 g). In Experiment I animals with adriamycin-induced nephropathy were fed diets containing 6% (Low-Protein Diet Group = LPDG), 20% (Normal-Protein Diet Group = NPDG) and 40% (High-Protein Diet Group = HPDG) protein and were observed for 30 weeks. In Experiment II the rats with adriamycin nephropathy were divided into 2 groups: ADR, that received adriamycin alone, and ADR-ENA, that received adriamycin plus enalapril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor. The animals were sacrificed after a 24-week observation period. Six hours before sacrifice the animals were injected with 131I-ferritin and the amount of 131I-ferritin in the glomeruli was measured. In Experiment III, renal histology was performed 4, 8 and 16 weeks after adriamycin injection. At the end of Experiment I the tubulointerstitial lesion index was 2 for LPDG, 8 for NPDG, and 7.5 for HPDG (P < 0.05); the frequency of glomerulosclerosis was 19 +/- 6.1% in LPDG, 42.6 +/- 6% in NPDG, and 54 +/- 9% in HPDG (P < 0.05); and proteinuria was 61.1 +/- 25 mg/24 h in LPDG, 218.7 +/- 27.5 mg/24 h in NPDG, and 324.5 +/- 64.8 mg/24 h in HPDG (P < 0.05). In Experiment II, at sacrifice, 24-h proteinuria was 189 +/- 16.1 mg in ADR, and 216 +/- 26.1 mg in ADR-ENA (P > 0.05); the tubulointerstitial lesion index was 5 for ADR, and 5 for ADR-ENA (P > 0.05); the frequency of glomerulosclerosis was 40 +/- 5.2% in ADR and 44 +/- 6% in ADR-ENA (P > 0.05); the amount of 131I-ferritin in the mesangium was 214.26 +/- 22.71 cpm/mg protein in ADR and 253.77 +/- 69.72 cpm/mg protein in ADR-ENA (P > 0.05). In Experiment III, sequential histological analysis revealed an acute tubulointerstitial cellular infiltrate at week 4, which was decreased at week 8. Tubular casts and dilatation were first seen at week 8 and increased at week 16 when few glomerular lesions were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "318": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of post-renal transplant erythrocytosis (PTE). In an attempt to assess the effect of drug treatment on serum erythropoietin level, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary protein excretion, we prospectively evaluated 8 consecutive cadaveric renal transplant recipients with PTE treated with ACE inhibitor therapy for 3 months. In response to ACE inhibition, the mean hematocrit (HCT) value decreased from 53.7 +/- 0.6% before treatment to 42.7 +/- 2.2% at the conclusion of the study (p = 0.03). However, 1 patient failed to respond to ACE inhibition (HCT > 50%), and 2 patients with PTE developed anemia (HCT < 35%) while maintained on drug treatment. Although the mean serum erythropoietin level decreased during ACE inhibition (from 22.8 +/- 8.4 to 9.4 +/- 5.3 mU/ml; p = 0.06), a consistent change in individual erythropoietin levels was not identified. At the conclusion of the study, the serum erythropoietin levels were undetectable in 4 patients, decreased in 1, unchanged in 2, and increased in the only patient with PTE who failed to respond to drug treatment. All patients tolerated the ACE inhibitor therapy without developing cough or hyperkalemia. In addition, serum creatinine levels, 125I-iothalamate clearances, and mean arterial blood pressures were unchanged throughout the study. Microalbuminuria (spot urinary albumin/creatinine ratio between 30 and 200 mg/g) developed in 5 patients with PTE and coincided with the onset of erythrocytosis (25.2 +/- 7 mg/g before PTE and 76.3 +/- 36.7 mg/g at the time of PTE detection).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "319": "ACE inhibitors improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients with normal renal function. Hypertensive patients with renal failure are a high-risk group who are particularly glucose intolerant and insulin resistant. We have therefore studied whether ACE inhibition improve glucose tolerance in this group as well. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study 10 patients with stable moderate chronic renal failure (mean endogenous creatinine clearance 40 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2) were examined. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or the ACE inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/day per os) for 14 days. After 7 days of wash-out they received the alternative medications in random order for another 14 days. Before and after each of the two treatment periods (day 1 and day 15) an intravenous glucose tolerance test (i.v. GTT) with concomitant determination of insulin levels was performed. The glucose disappearance rate (K value) was calculated to express changes in glucose tolerance. An i.v. GTT was also performed in a group of healthy volunteers. The mean K value was significantly (P < 0.05) lower, i.e. glucose tolerance was impaired, in patients compared with healthy controls. In addition, baseline and peak insulin levels after the i.v. GTT were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in patients than in healthy subjects. The K values in patients before and after placebo treatment (1.33 +/- 0.31 and 1.41 +/- 0.45 respectively) were not significantly different from the values with perindopril treatment (1.35 +/- 0.37 and 1.41 +/- 0.48 respectively). Furthermore, no significant differences between placebo and perindopril treatment were found with respect to the insulin response to the glucose load. The peak (5 min) insulin concentrations after the i.v. glucose load were 49.0 +/- 19.2 microU/ml (day 1) and 50.0 +/- 24.9 (day 15) with placebo and 49.2 +/- 19.3 (day 1) and 46.8 +/- 17.9 (day 15) with perindopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "320": "During the past decade, experimental and clinical evidence has indicated an important role for the renin-angiotensin system in the progressive destruction of nephrons in a wide variety of chronic renal diseases. Studies have indicated that in the subtotally nephrectomized rat model of progressive glomerulosclerosis, in experimental diabetes mellitus, in the chronic phase of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and in Heymann's nephritis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors dramatically preserve both nephron structure and function. Clinical studies have similarly noted that chronic administration of ACE inhibitors inhibits progression of renal failure in type I diabetes and type II diabetes as well as primary glomerulopathies, sickle cell nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosis, chronic pyelonephritis and adult polycystic kidney disease. Current evidence suggests that the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors is primarily due to inhibition of angiotensin II production, and there is strong suggestive evidence for increases in local intrarenal activation of the renin-angiotensin system in these conditions. In obstructive uropathy, activation of the renin-angiotensin system has also been shown to be an important aspect of the early functional changes and may be of importance in the subsequent generation of interstitial fibrosis. In the obstructed kidney, renin and angiotensinogen production increase and type I angiotensin receptors decrease. Inhibitors of angiotensin II production and angiotensin II action partially reverse the vasoconstriction and the reduced renal blood flow, and abolish the changes in expression of AT1 MRNA induced by obstruction. Studies suggest that the angiotensin-mediated increases in tubulointerstitial fibrosis may be mediated by increased production of transforming growth factor-beta.", 
    "321": "The rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), which has been found to develop spontaneous obesity, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; Type 2), and hypertension, was used to evaluate the potential blood pressure-lowering effects of captopril as well as the specific effects, if any, on the prediabetic state. Intravenous and oral glucose tolerance testing was carried out with oral captopril dosing. Results showed that captopril significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all monkeys and significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose levels. Based on these preliminary studies in monkeys, we conclude that captopril exerted antihypertensive effects without adverse effects on glucose metabolism.", 
    "322": "This study was performed to investigate the beneficial effects of prolonged treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, delapril, on the appearance of symptoms of hypertensive cardiovascular disease in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Cardiovascular disease symptoms: stroke, kidney dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy, were evaluated by monitoring the incidence of stroke signs, urinary excretion of protein and the heart weight, respectively. The SHRSP that were kept under salt-loaded conditions (1% NaCl drinking solution) from six weeks of age developed severe hypertension, showed an increased incidence of stroke signs and increased urinary excretion of protein. Long-term treatment with delapril (10mg/kg/day, p.o. for four weeks) decreased the blood pressure and completely inhibited the incidence of stroke signs and the increase in urinary excretion of protein. In SHRSP that were kept under normal conditions (without 1% NaCl drinking solution), long term treatment with delapril at the same dose decreased the heart weight and, after five weeks of treatment, left ventricular weight was decreased significantly and the wall/lumen ratio of small coronary arterioles and the thickness of the left ventricular wall were decreased slightly. These results indicate that delapril can prevent the development of symptoms of hypertensive cardiovascular diseases: stroke, kidney dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy, with antihypertensive activity in SHRSP.", 
    "323": "In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and excretion of ramipril in man, 8 cholecystectomy patients aged between 53 and 68 years received 5 mg ramipril orally as a single dose. All patients had a T-drain inserted to permit bile collection; all gave their informed consent to participate in the trial. Serum samples were collected half-hourly until 2 hours, then hourly until 6 hours, then at 8, 10, 24 and 25 hours after intake. Urine was collected in 2-hour fractions until 8 hours, followed by a 4- and a 12-hour fraction. Bile was collected hourly until 6 hours, followed by a 6- and a 12-hour collecting fraction. Concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat in serum, and determinations in urine and bile of ramipril, ramiprilat, ramipril glucuronide, ramiprilat glucuronide, diketopiperazine and diketopiperazine acid were made; total amounts excreted were calculated. Peak concentrations of ramiprilat in plasma (8.7 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) were reached after about 8 hours. AUC0-8 and AUC0-24-values were 36.5 and 111.9 ng.h/ml, respectively. Ramiprilat Cmax-concentrations were about 300-fold higher in bile than in plasma, the corresponding difference for ramipril between bile and plasma was about 4-fold. The main fractions excreted in the urine were diketopiperazine acid and ramiprilat amounting to 13.2 +/- 5.6 and 4.4 +/- 2.4%, respectively, of the dose administered. Only a very small fraction of the dose was excreted with urine as unchanged ramipril, on average 0.9 +/- 1.0%. The main fractions excreted in the bile were diketopiperazine acid, ramiprilat glucuronide and diketopiperazine, 9.0 +/- 5.3, 3.4 +/- 4.2 and 2.0 +/- 1.2% in 24 hours, respectively, of the dose administered. Only a negligible fraction of the dose (average 0.1 +/- 0.1%) was excreted with bile as unchanged ramipril. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that circulating ramipril and ramiprilat are eliminated by both the liver and the kidneys. For the patients studied it can be estimated from late collection periods that some 2/3 of circulating ramipril and ramiprilat are eliminated by the kidneys and 1/3 eliminated by the liver.", 
    "324": "Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) participate in the development of myocardial injury by releasing free oxygen radicals and by involvement in the no-reflow phenomenon. Neutrophil-mediated myocardial injury, therefore contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure. We investigated the effect of oral treatment with enalapril on neutrophil free oxygen radical production, aggregation and adherence in patients with moderate heart failure (New York Heart Association-NYHA II and III degrees). Samples were taken before and 48 h after a single 10 mg oral dose. Oral enalapril inhibited hydrogen peroxide released by unstimulated PMN, but did not affect stimulated H2O2 release, superoxide anion production, adhesion or aggregation of PMN. Enalaprilat in vitro stimulated PMN to release H2O2 and superoxide anions. Furthermore, in the in vitro conditions both enalaprilat and enalapril inhibited hydrogen peroxide release by stimulated cells. We conclude that, despite certain modifications of neutrophil function in vitro, oral administration of enalapril seems to exert a limited biological effect on circulating neutrophils.", 
    "325": "1. A randomised, placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted to assess the effect of tenidap sodium, a novel cytokine modulating drug, on the stable hypotensive response to the angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in subjects with mild to moderate, uncomplicated, essential hypertension. 2. Twenty-four male and female hypertensives, aged 33-77 years, received either 120 mg tenidap sodium or matched placebo daily for 22 days concomitantly with enalapril. 3. Mean endpoint supine and standing, systolic and diastolic pressures remained within 10% of baseline in each treatment group. However, the endpoint values were marginally above baseline during double-blind treatment with tenidap and marginally below baseline in the group receiving placebo. The increases in supine and standing systolic pressures in the tenidap group differed significantly from the changes in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between groups in changes in pulse rate. 4. Gastrointestinal side effects of mild to moderate severity attributed to treatment with tenidap were experienced by five subjects, one of whom was withdrawn during the third week of treatment. One subject receiving placebo was withdrawn because of a moderate headache attributed to study treatment. 5. The results of this study suggest that treatment with tenidap may interfere with the anti-hypertensive efficacy of ACE inhibitors. It is recommended that blood pressure should be monitored when tenidap is administered concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "326": "The functional effects of the intranasal application of exogenous vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were evaluated in 12 healthy volunteers before and after neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition with phosphoramidon (PA) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril. The three neuropeptides increased nasal airway resistance (NAR) measured by anterior rhinomanometry and superficial capillary blood flow measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). After pretreatment of the nasal mucosa with PA, the effects of VIP, SP and CGRP on the LDF signal, NAR and mucus production were potentiated, whereas local pretreatment with captopril did not modify these functional effects. These observations suggest that NEP, but not ACE, may participate in the catabolism of neuropeptides when applied directly to the human nasal mucosa. Furthermore, since these neuropeptides induced nasal obstruction, increased blood flow and rhinorrhea, a decreased activity of the enzymes involved in their degradation could be involved in the physiopathology of rhinitis symptoms.", 
    "327": "We examined the relationship between airway obstruction and plasma extravasation produced by the intravenous administration of the selective NK1 receptor agonist [Sar9, Met(O2)11]-substance P(SP). Conscious guinea-pigs were injected with Evans' blue dye followed by intravenous [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP. Animals were killed 3 min later and airway obstruction, determined via excised lung gas volumes, and plasma extravasation in the trachea, mainstem bronchi and intrapulmonary airways quantitated. Maximal plasma protein extravasation occurred at a dose about 30 times less than that required to elicit airway obstruction. Neither the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, thiorphan, or the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, altered the extravasation response to [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP. However, thiorphan alone or combined with captopril produced a small but significant potentiation of the airway obstructive response. The marked difference between pulmonary gas trapping and Evans' blue extravasation responses suggest that [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP-induced airway obstruction is not secondary to increased pulmonary edema.", 
    "328": "The diurnal time course of urinary flow rate (UV), urinary sodium (UNaV), and potassium (UKV) excretion, and of hormones such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and aldosterone, was investigated during 5 days of continuous captopril infusion (15 micrograms.kg body weight-1.min-1) in 4 conscious dogs on a high sodium diet (14.5 mmol Na.kg body weight-1.24 h-1). All food and water was given once daily at 8.30 a.m. On the control day and on days 1, 3, and 5 of captopril infusion, urine was collected by an automated system at 20-min intervals over 24 h, blood was taken every 4 h. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate were evaluated as 5-min averages. Time courses of UNaV, UV, and UKV were compared with the individual control day without captopril. With captopril, 24-hour balances for Na and H2O were slightly negative, while the K balance was slightly positive for 2-3 days. Thereafter, all 24-hour balances were restored. MABP continued to decrease even after Na and water intake and output had come into balance again. Captopril treatment changed the diurnal excretion pattern for UNaV and UV characteristically. In the postprandial period until 5 p.m., less Na and urine were excreted than on the control day, whereas during the evening and night more Na and urine were excreted. The changes in the excretion pattern persisted for the entire observation period. The results indicate that disturbances in the regulating systems, induced by converting-enzyme blockade, bring about complex reactions of, e.g., MABP, ANP and aldosterone that finally restore Na and water 24-hour input/output balances.",

Although compliance is overestimated by pill-counting, this technique is most frequently used. 389 Austrian general practitioners studied compliance in 945 hypertensives, using the Medication Event Monitoring System. The patients were asked to take the ACE-inhibitor Cilacapril once a day between 7.00 a.m. and 9.00 a.m. Each package opening was registered by a microprocessor located in the cover of the drug vial. In this study it turned out that only 1.3% of the patients did open their vials between 7.00 a.m. and 9.00 a.m. 2 thirds of the patients actually took less than 80% and 36% less than half of the prescribed medication. There was no correlation between compliance and sex, age, smoking habits, tolerance or duration of hypertension. Even fall in blood pressure was the same in compliant and non compliant patients. The conclusion is that compliance is bad in a general practitioner setting and further more that casual readings as performed in this study are an insufficient tool to judge efficacy.",

Among the non cardiac considerations there are some metabolic factors (non adverse effect on the lipid profile), as well as a positive effect on some endocrine-metabolic cascades like the insulin-resistance syndrome and a very important role in certain special situations as coexistence with other diseases and individual characteristics of the patient (pregnancy or elderly for example).", 
    "336": "A disturbing interaction of PAN membranes and the bradykinin generation system particularly in the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been described. A modified new membrane, SPAN (special PAN), was produced by varying the polymer components in type and composition, in particular by a reduction in Na-Methallylsulfonate. Although the SPAN membrane successfully averted the bradykinin generating ability of PAN, it was important to determine whether such a modification did not lead to a loss of the satisfactory biocompatibility profile characteristic of the parent membrane. For this purpose, we conducted the present clinical study in nine patients comparing 3 membranes; (i) a polysulphone membrane (F60S); (ii) PAN; and (iii) SPAN, to examine the clinical biocompatibility profile and performance of the new membrane. A small increase in C5a with F60S and SPAN was found which is in the range expected for highly biocompatible synthetic membranes. The three dialysers had a similar inert profile for terminal complement complex arterial values, and had similar venous values. A minimal nonsignificant decline in white cell count was observed at 15 min for all dialysers, but otherwise WBC counts were unchanged. Platelet counts were unchanged throughout treatment for the three dialysers. Arterial and venous thrombin-anti-thrombin complex values were similar for all three dialysers.

We utilized ultrasonic tissue characterization to define potentially salutary effects of treatment with ACE inhibitors on the material properties of the heart and its potential influence on cardiac remodeling at the cellular level. Ten 1-month-old cardiomyopathic (CM) Syrian hamsters were treated with captopril (2 g/L water ad libitum), and 10 CM and 5 normal hamsters were maintained untreated for 9 months. Hearts were excised, and backscattered radio-frequency data were acquired from 1200 independent sites from each specimen with a high-resolution 50-MHz acoustic microscope for calculation of integrated backscatter. Treatment with captopril elicited relative decreases in left ventricular (LV) wet weight, LV calcium concentration and integrated backscatter (IB) in treated as compared with untreated cardiomyopathic hearts without affecting LV collagen concentration. The IB from hearts of treated cardiomyopathic hamsters was significantly less in both grossly normal regions of myocardium (P < 0.02) and scar tissue regions (P = 0.0005) as compared with IB from hearts of untreated hamsters. The reduced integrated backscatter from hearts of treated cardiomyopathic hamsters indicates direct alterations in the material properties of cardiomyopathic hearts after captopril therapy. The lower IB from scar tissue in the treated animals was associated with decreased scar tissue calcification, which represents a novel therapeutic effect of captopril. This is the first report that delineates direct effects of ACE inhibitors on the material properties of both scar tissue and grossly normal myocardium at the cellular level in experimental dilated cardiomyopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "338": "The local effects of angiotensin II (ANG II) on the heart may play an important role for the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. Numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II has distinctive cellular effects in the cardiovascular system which are independent from its effects on blood pressure. These have led to the hypothesis that activation of the angiotensin system in the heart could be of functional relevance for the adaptive processes in several cardiovascular disorders such as cardiac hypertrophy heart failure. This concept has been further supported by clinical studies showing the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in these circumstances. In order to study the gene regulation of renin-angiotensin system components in cardiac disorders we investigated the gene expression of angiotensin converting enzyme in human heart failure. Results showed that the enzyme is activated locally in this condition, supporting previous studies in animals. Taken together with recent evidence from genetic studies linking the enzyme to myocardial infarction and cardiac hypertrophy, our findings are in support of the notion that angiotensin converting enzyme plays a central role in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology.",

Following completion of the trial, the patients continued to receive antihypertensive treatment according to ordinary clinical criteria. All but four patients in the enalapril group remained on that drug, and two patients in the control group were switched to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In the present study the fate of the 70 patients 44 months after termination of the trial was investigated, with a total follow-up of around 7 years. In the original enalapril group, 12 of the 35 patients (34%) were alive without renal replacement therapy versus five of the 35 patients (14%) in the control group. This difference of 20% in favour of having been in the enalapril group in the original trial was significant (P = 0.05; 95% confidence limits 0.5-39.5%). The influence of baseline proteinuria on clinical outcome was analysed. In the original control group, baseline renal clearances of albumin (Calb) and immunoglobulin G (CIgG) were significantly lower in patients surviving without renal replacement therapy at follow-up than in patients who ultimately developed end-stage renal failure (ESRF) (P < 0.05). In the original enalapril group, these baseline clearances were equal in the two renal outcome groups. In all patients, baseline Calb and CIgG were negatively correlated with the rate of change in GFR during the controlled trial (r = -0.37, P < 0.01 and r = -0.28, P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "340": "We have recently found that vascular natriuretic peptide (NP)-A receptor mRNA is upregulated in genetically hypertensive (SHR-SP/Izm) and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. In the present study, we examined the effects of antihypertensive treatments on aortic NP-A receptor mRNA expression in these hypertensive rats using ribonuclease protection assay. Oral administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, derapril, but not a calcium channel blocker, manidipine, produced a significant decrease of the NP-A receptor mRNA level after 4 weeks, while both antihypertensive agents showed similar hypotensive effects. Plasma renin was high in SHR-SP/Izm and low in DOCA-salt rats. These results suggest that the vascular renin-angiotensin system rather than the blood pressure has an important role in the regulation of the vascular NP-A receptor.", 
    "341": "Botulinum neurotoxin serotype B (BoNT/B) and tetanus toxin (TeTx) block neuroexocytosis through selective endoproteolysis of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP). The enzymological properties of both toxins were compared for the first time in their cleavage of VAMP and various sized fragments using a sensitive chromatographic assay. The optimal substrate sizes for the zinc-dependent protease activities of the light chains of TeTx and BoNT/B were established using synthetic peptides corresponding to the hydrophilic core of VAMP (30-62 amino acids in length). TeTx was found to selectively cleave the largest peptide at a single site, Gln76-Phe77. It exhibited the most demanding specificity, requiring the entire hydrophilic domain (a 62-mer) for notable hydrolysis, whereas BoNT/B efficiently cleaved the much smaller 40-mer. Thus, an unusually long N-terminal sequence of 44 amino acids upstream of the scissile bond is required for the selective hydrolysis of VAMP by TeTx. Using the largest peptide, BoNT/B and TeTx exhibited approximately 50% and 35%, respectively, of the activities shown toward intact VAMP, detergent solubilized from synaptic vesicles. Given the large size of the smallest substrates, it is possible that these neurotoxins recognize and require a three-dimensional structure. Although both toxins were inactivated by divalent metal chelators, neither was antagonized by phosphoramidon or ASQFETS (a substrate-related peptide that spans the cleavage site), and TeTx was only feebly inhibited by captopril; also, they were distinguishable in their relative activities at different pHs, temperatures, and ionic strengths. These collective findings are important in the design of effective inhibitors for both toxins, as well as in raising the possibility that TeTx and BoNT/B interact somewhat differently with VAMP.", 
    "342": "The aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of metalloproteinase inhibitors on leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase in human neutrophil cytosol and to examine the effects of captopril on intact neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. Cytosolic fractions were assayed for LTA4 hydrolase and 5-lipoxygenase activity in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Only bestatin, 1,10-O-phenanthroline, captopril and fosinoprilat demonstrated significant effects. The IC50 of captopril and fosinoprilat for LTA4 hydrolase activity were 500 microM and 1 mM, respectively. No inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity in cytosolic fractions was detected. The effect of captopril was only minimally reversed by ZnSO4. The IC50 of captopril for inhibition of LTB4 synthesis in intact neutrophils was 63 microM. Furthermore, 5-HETE production in intact cells was diminished 25.3 +/- 8.5% in the presence of 1 mM captopril. Oral captopril inhibited stimulated LTB4 release by subsequently isolated neutrophils by 48.1 +/- 5.6% and 5-HETE release by 43.2 +/- 5.5%. Thus, captopril is an inhibitor of LTB4 synthesis in neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. However, there are differences between the potency of this drug as assessed in cytosol and intact cell studies. This study significantly extends previous reports in that it demonstrates that captopril is a more potent inhibitor of LTB4 synthesis in intact neutrophils than in cytosol and in that it demonstrates an inhibitory effect of captopril on synthesis of LTB4 by neutrophils exposed to captopril in vivo.",

In this study, we measured Ficoll sieving coefficients, hemodynamic parameters, and urinary protein excretion rates in the FHH strain of fawn-hooded rats. These animals spontaneously develop systemic and glomerular hypertension, proteinuria, and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis at a relatively young age. Three groups of FHH rats were studied: two-kidney controls (2K), untreated uninephrectomized rats (CON-NX), and uninephrectomized rats treated with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (ENA-NX). CON-NX rats had higher glomerular transcapillary pressures (delta P) and higher urinary excretion rates of both total protein (UpV) and albumin (UaV) than did 2K rats, whereas treatment with enalapril prevented both glomerular hypertension and the increased proteinuria. Ficoll sieving coefficients were significantly higher in both groups of NX rats compared with 2K rats only for Stokes-Einstein radii (rs) > or = 46 A. Fits of sieving data to pore models showed a small increase in the number of large, nonselective pores in NX, which was not prevented by enalapril treatment. Total clearances of Ficoll with rs = 36 A (the size of albumin) in CON-NX and ENA-NX groups were unchanged compared with 2K animals. In contrast, UaV in CON-NX rats was more than six times that of 2K and ENA-NX rats.

Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate were measured every 20 minutes for 24 hours. Single-dose ramipril reduced both SBP and DBP (P < .001) without affecting heart rate. Long-term treatment produced a small additional antihypertensive effect, again without modifying heart rate. Cosinor analysis demonstrated that both administrations of ramipril effectively lowered SBP and DBP mesors (P < .001), compared to placebo; circadian rhythms remained undisturbed. Heart rate also was not modified on any circadian parameter. A significant reduction (P < .001) of blood pressure amplitude, however, occurred after long-term treatment and may have importance in terms of preventing cardiac damage.",

    "355": "A survey is given of the currently used therapeutics in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. Symptomatic treatment is usually performed along the following lines: rest, sodium and fluid restriction to unload the decompensating heart, loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or other vasodilators; inotropic agents to improve the heart's mechanical performance; attempts to counteract the neuro-endocrine compensatory mechanisms, that is the activated sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, as well as the rise in vasopressine levels. New insights have been obtained in the effects of cardiac glycosides, which are probably rather based on counteracting the elevated sympathetic neuronal activity than on their weak and uncertain inotropic action. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are probably more effective than classical vasodilators owing to their additional interaction with the neuro-endocrine compensatory mechanisms. Ibopamine, a prodrug of epinine, appears to be rather a vasodilator and antagonist of the neuro-endocrine compensatory mechanisms than an inotropic agent. The most important clinical trials addressing the efficacy and adverse reactions to the various aforementioned therapeutics are discussed. New, experimental approaches in the drug treatment of chronic congestive heart failure include beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, vasopressin antagonists and inhibitors of atrial natriuretic peptide degradation.",

It is suggested that the use of diuretics should be increased in this age group.", 
    "357": "We investigated whether long-term infusion of kallikrein would attenuate renal injury in salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. A subdepressor dose of purified rat urinary kallikrein (700 ng/d IV) was infused by osmotic minipump for 4 weeks in male Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high salt (2% NaCl) diet. This dose did not affect the time-dependent elevation of blood pressure; however, urinary protein excretion was significantly decreased, and glomerular filtration rate was increased. These beneficial effects were reflected morphologically by an attenuation of glomerulosclerotic lesions and tubular injury seen in the hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Kallikrein infusion increased urinary excretion of bradykinin and stimulated excretion of cyclic GMP, suggesting that the kallikrein-kinin-prostaglandin and nitric oxide axes were enhanced by rat urinary kallikrein infusion. The alterations induced by kallikrein infusion were potentiated by the concomitant administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor alacepril. These studies indicated that long-term replacement with rat tissue kallikrein attenuates renal injury in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats.",

Urine and serum were tested for total protein, immunoglobulin G, albumin, alpha 1-microglobulin, retinol binding protein, and beta 2-microglobulin. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were assessed by iothalamate and p-aminohippuric clearance, respectively.

    "359": "The purpose of this study was to examine (1) whether endogenous adenosine receptors inhibit the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from adrenal medulla in response to physiological and pharmacological stimuli and (2) whether the renin-angiotensin system modulates this effect of endogenous adenosine. We used a conscious animal model to approximate normal physiological conditions. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a surface adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl- 8-(p-sulfophenyl)xanthine (DPSPX) to explore the effect of endogenous adenosine. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in response to hydralazine-induced hypotension were measured in these animals. The same protocol was repeated in rats pretreated with either adrenalectomy or captopril. The results showed that DPSPX treatment significantly increased plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels at both baseline conditions and after hydralazine-induced hypotension. The results from the adrenalectomized rats showed that the difference in plasma epinephrine level between the control and DPSPX groups originated from the adrenal medulla. Pretreatment with captopril attenuated the rise of plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in DPSPX-treated animals. This result suggests that endogenous adenosine receptors inhibit epinephrine release from the adrenal medulla and suppress plasma norepinephrine levels. When catecholamine release was stimulated by physiological and pharmacological stimuli, this inhibitory function of adenosine receptors was augmented. The renin-angiotensin system is at least partially responsible for the modulatory function of endogenous adenosine on the catecholamine response as demonstrated in this study.", 
    "360": "We investigated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in neointima formation in a species in which converting enzyme inhibitors have been so far ineffective in suppressing abnormal vascular repair. The effects of converting enzyme inhibition by perindopril and selective blockade of angiotensin subtype 1 receptor by DuP 753 were assessed on neointima formation after balloon injury of rabbit carotid artery. Myointimal growth was measured by histomorphometric analysis. In rabbits treated 6 days before and for 14 days after injury, perindopril (2 mg/kg per day PO, n = 7) significantly reduced neointima formation (-51%, P < .01). DuP 753 (1 mg/d, n = 8) infused perivascularly for 14 days in the vicinity of injured carotid artery also markedly suppressed myointimal thickening (-60%, P < .01). To determine whether angiotensin subtype 2 receptor was implicated in this vascular response, we infused CGP 42112A, a specific subtype 2 receptor ligand, continuously for 14 days according to the same protocol of DuP 753 administration. CGP 42112A (1 mg/d) did not change the neointima-media ratio, indicating that angiotensin subtype 2 receptors were not involved in myointimal hyperplasia in rabbits. Thus in rabbits, the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in neointima formation, and the protective effect of perindopril appears to be mediated mainly by inhibition of angiotensin II production, because blockade of the subtype 1 receptor reduced myointimal growth in a manner similar to that of converting enzyme inhibition and because intracarotid infusion of angiotensin II (500 ng/min) at the site of injury enhanced the vascular response (+39%, P < .05). Bradykinin (500 ng/min) administered in the same conditions as angiotensin II did not modify neointima formation.",

Systemic neurohormonal activation did not occur with the selective left coronary artery infusion; there were no changes in plasma renin activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, or atrial natriuretic peptide. In patients with aortic stenosis, LV end-diastolic pressure declined from 25 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 2 mm Hg (P < .05). LV pressure-volume and LV pressure-dimension relations showed downward shifts by ventriculography and echocardiography, respectively, indicating improved diastolic distensibility. Regional area change during isovolumic relaxation increased in the anterior segments perfused with enalaprilat but decreased in the inferior segments, indicating acceleration of isovolumic relaxation in the anterior segments and reciprocal shortening in the inferior segments. Regional peak filling rate increased in the anterior segments but not in the inferior segments, and the regional area stiffness constant decreased in the anterior segments but not in the inferior segments. There were no changes in heart rate, cardiac output, or right atrial pressure, excluding alterations in right ventricular/pericardial constraint. In contrast, in the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy the decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure from 22 +/- 2 to 18 +/- 2 mm Hg (P < .05) was accompanied by a significant fall in right atrial pressure (9 +/- 1 to 6 +/- 1 mm Hg), implicating alterations in pericardial constraint. The patients with dilated cardiomyopathy showed no improvement in regional diastolic relaxation, filling, or distensibility.",

In contrast, these effects of intracoronary enalaprilat on diastolic function were not observed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who did not have concentric hypertrophy. These observations support the hypothesis that the cardiac renin-angiotensin system is activated in patients with concentric pressure-overload hypertrophy and that this activation may contribute to impaired diastolic function.",

Systemic hemodynamics (Swan-Ganz and radial artery catheters) were measured before (rest and submaximal recumbent bicycle ergometry), during (rest), and at the end (rest and exercise) of each 45-minute single- or combination-infusion period. Placebo did not change hemodynamics or renin activity. Effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by remikiren and enalaprilat was indicated by increases of plasma immunoreactive renin together with rapid and complete inhibition of renin activity after remikiren and an increase after enalaprilat (all P < or = .05). Remikiren and enalaprilat rapidly and to a similar extent reduced resting blood pressure through a reduction of systemic vascular resistance, and these changes were significantly correlated to baseline plasma renin activity. Both compounds also decreased pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge, and right atrial pressures to a similar extent (P < .05). During exercise, pulmonary capillary wedge and right atrial pressures were equally reduced and stroke volume index was increased with remikiren and enalaprilat (P < .05) for both).

We retrospectively studied 25 (76% black) chronic hemodialysis patients who received ACEIs for blood pressure control. The mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 115.4 +/- 10.4 mm Hg to 112.7 +/- 9.0 mm Hg (mean +/- SD; P = NS) and there was no change in the interdialytic weight gain (3.74 +/- 1.5 kg v 3.72 +/- 1.5 kg; P = NS). Only 10 (40%) patients had some reduction in their interdialytic weight gain; in four of them the reduction was more than 20% of the pre-ACEI weight gain. When nine patients who had no decline in blood pressure were excluded due to possible noncompliance, the mean arterial blood pressure in the remaining 16 patients (75% black) declined from 119.3 +/- 9.9 mm Hg to 111.6 +/- 9.9 mm Hg (P < 0.0001), but there was no change in the interdialytic fluid weight gain (3.7 +/- 1.4 kg v 3.8 +/- 1.4 kg; P = NS). There was no correlation between age, race, etiology of renal failure, or blood pressure response and change in the interdialytic weight gain after ACEI treatment. Our results do not support the previous report that ACEIs significantly decrease the interdialytic weight gain in chronic hemodialysis patients. The multifactorial nature of excessive fluid intake in the hemodialysis patients and the differences in patient population and study design may account for this discrepancy.",

In the present study, 65 of the original 149 patients with essential hypertension included in the short-term studies were reexamined after treatment for 2 to 3 years. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp method showed that the significant decrease in insulin sensitivity (p < 0.01) induced by treatment with pindolol, propanolol, metoprolol, atenolol, or hydrochlorothiazide after 4 to 6 months persisted after 2 to 3 years of treatment. Furthermore, the increase in insulin sensitivity reported for captopril after 6 months (p < 0.05) was not significantly altered during long-term treatment. Also, the raised levels of very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (p < 0.01) and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01) induced by most of the beta-adrenergic blockade without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and hydrochlorothiazide persisted. Captopril, on the other hand, did not significantly affect the lipids during prolonged treatment. In conclusion, the magnitude of the metabolic effects induced by antihypertensive treatment during short-term studies was of the same order after long-term treatment over 2 to 3 years and were not significantly different from the results in the short-term studies.",

ACE inhibitors have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of recurrent MI in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The mechanism by which activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leads to MI has not been ascertained, but it may be related to the effect of angiotensin II or aldosterone on the development of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, plaque rupture, or thrombosis after plaque rupture. Experimental data suggest that each of these mechanisms may be of importance. Several prospective randomized studies are under way to determine the effect of ACE inhibitors on recurrent ischemic events and the progression of atherosclerosis in patients without left ventricular dysfunction.

We evaluated the survival of gerbils treated with PD-123319, a ligand of AT2 receptors, to test the hypothesis that restoration of BF to ischemic cerebral tissue produced by AII is mediated through AT2 receptors. Abrupt unilateral carotid ligation was performed on 300 gerbils.

    "411": "We compared the mechanisms of the antiplatelet effects of nitroglycerin (NTG) and stabilized nitric oxide (NO). Stabilized NO was in the form of S-nitrosothiols [S-nitroso-albumin (S-NO-Alb) and S-nitrosocaptopril (S-NO-Cap)] or heme-NO [sodium nitro-prusside (SNP)]. The molecular structure of S-NO-Cap was confirmed by mass spectrometry. NTG, SNP, S-NO-Alb, and S-NO-Cap inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation dose dependently. The inhibitory IC50 value was 109 microM for NTG, 0.98 microM for SNP, 2.99 microM for S-NO-Alb, and 2.5 microM for S-NO-Cap. NTG (200 microM) released 15.4 microM nitrite anion into platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after 60-min incubation, to which platelets contributed 5.4 microM. On the other hand, SNP and S-NO-Cap released undetectable amounts of NO2- when incubated in either PRP or platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The platelet cytosolic calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration was measured fluorometrically in Fura-2-loaded gel-filtered platelets. Thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization was significantly inhibited by 10 microM NTG, SNP, S-NO-Alb, and S-NO-Cap, whereas resting Ca2+ was unaltered. Ca2+ mobilization was inhibited 28.6% by NTG, 91.9% by SNP, 90.0% by S-NO-Alb, and 92.7% by S-NO-Cap. These results demonstrate that NTG is an exogenous donor of NO, but releases it only slowly. On the other hand, SNP and S-nitrosothiols inhibited platelet aggregation by the action of stabilized NO incorporated in their structure and did not release NO. NTG and stabilized NO shared a common mechanism of antiplatelet activity, which involved inhibition of calcium mobilization.", 
    "412": "Previous studies have documented that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevents spontaneous proteinuria and enhances the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient in male MWF/Ztm rats. The aim of this study was to study whether these beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on glomerular capillary wall function are derived from the preservation of its ultrastructure. Conventional morphometrical analysis of kidney tissue, by light and electron microscopy, was used to quantify glomerular structural changes in the male MWF/Ztm rats treated with the ACE inhibitor cilazapril for 2 and 6 months and in age-matched untreated controls. At the end of the observation periods, both systolic blood pressure and urinary protein excretion were significantly reduced in treated animals as compared with controls. Glomerular volume increased significantly with time but was comparable in control and in treated rats. Surface area available for filtration (measured as peripheral capillary wall) was comparable in control and in treated animals at the same time and increased significantly with time only in treated rats. Mesangial volume was significantly higher in cilazapril-treated animals than in controls after 2 months of treatment and was comparable after 6 months. ACE inhibitor treatment did not induce significant ultrastructural changes such as basement membrane thickness, configuration of epithelial podocytes, and the width and the frequency of the epithelial slit diaphragms. These results indicate that the previously observed increase in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient by an ACE inhibitor in these animals is not the consequence of changes in filtering surface area but likely reflects an increase in membrane hydraulic permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "413": "1. Nitric oxide (NO) has been suggested as the mediator of the vascular response to bradykinin. In the present study, we found that NO did not mediate the hypotensive response to bradykinin. In addition, the significance of kininase II in terminating a kinin-induced hypotension and the role of the adrenergic system in compensating for the acute fall in blood pressure (BP) was established. 2. In normal rats, the NO-synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induced a rise in basal BP (delta BP = 40 +/- 6 mmHg, P < 0.0014) which was not altered by pretreatment with phentolamine (delta BP = 50 +/- 6 mmHg, NS). L-NAME did not attenuate the acute fall in BP in response to bradykinin (3-30 micrograms kg-1) or kallikrein (6-300 micrograms kg-1). However, a significant decrease was observed in the duration of the hypotensive response (P < 0.027). This shorter duration was not observed after pretreatment with phenotolamine in addition to L-NAME. Phentolamine alone prolonged the hypotensive response to bradykinin (P < 0.04). These experiments confirm the role of NO-formation as a hypotensive component in BP homeostasis but not the role of NO as a mediator in kinin-induced hypotension. It further shows that the continuous NO-release also impedes the compensatory adrenergic hypertensive response following the acute fall in BP induced by bradykinin. 3. The hypertensive response to intravenously administered phenylephrine was found to be unchanged by preadministration of L-NAME (NS) thus showing that L-NAME did not change the sensitivity to the adrenergic response. In a separate protocol on L-NAME-treated rats we found no difference in heart rate (NS) during the recovery period following bradykinin before as compared to after administration of phentolamine. It was therefore concluded that the observed alterations in the duration of the hypotensive response were most probably due to changes in peripheral vascular resistance.4. To confirm further that NO is not a mediator in kinin-induced hypotension, we used an experimental model where the response to bradykinin was prolonged by preventing kinin degradation by kininase II-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI). To produce a hypotensive response purely dependent on kinin, the studies were performed after removal of the renin-angiotensin system by nephrectomy (Nx). In this model, bradykinin (6 microg kg-1, i.v.) induced a prolonged hypotensive response. Pretreatment with LNAME did not alter the magnitude or the progression of the hypotensive response to bradykinin, thus confirming that NO was not a mediator in BK-induced hypotension.5. To study the mechanisms involved in terminating the hypotensive response to bradykinin, the results from the Nx CEI-treated rats were compared with Nx animals not treated with CEL. In the latter group,bradykinin induced a short hypotensive response, i.e. 0.5 +/- 0.1 min as compared to the 17 +/- 1 min after CEI (P<0.003). After kininase II-inhibition (and L-NAME), BP recovery was totally dependent on the adrenergic system, since phentolamine prevented a recovery in BP during the experimental period(P<0.01, compared to the CEI/L-NAME group). These results demonstrate the importance of kininase II as the major agent in terminating a bradykinin-induced hypotension, whereas the adrenergic system plays a small, although significant role in compensating for the fall in BP. The continuous release of NO therefore not only lowers basal BP but also impedes the compensatory adrenergic response.",

The objectives of this study were to determine the prescribing prevalence of nitrates, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in general practice, to examine the indications recorded for these prescriptions, and to identify which therapeutic areas contribute to the variation in prescribing. 2. Anonymised patient-specific prescription data were taken from computerised records in 41 VAMP research practices in the Northern Region (total population 330,749).

Prescribing prevalence amongst the over 85's was less than half the peak rate for each drug group. Rates for men and women were comparable, except for nitrates where men had higher rates. 4. Recorded indication rates for patients with ischaemic heart disease and treated with any of these drugs reached 112 per 1,000 population in the 75-84 age group, and were higher in men than women, at all ages.

    "415": "To investigate whether the development of acute tolerance to furosemide in human subjects could be prevented or delayed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or alpha 1-receptor blockade, a study was conducted on healthy volunteers. The protocol on the experimental days was identical except for pre-treatment with placebo, captopril or prazosin. During continuous furosemide infusion with urinary furosemide excretion at a constant rate, the subjects became progressively dehydrated, with a maximal decrease in plasma volume of 9-11%. The diuretic/natriuretic response to furosemide was similar in the three protocols. Acute tolerance to diuresis developed earlier than that to natriuresis, again with no differences between the protocols. Not until the plasma volume had decreased by 9% did the natriuresis diminish significantly. In the placebo and captopril protocols acute tolerance was caused mainly by a decreased glomerular filtration rate, and in the prazosin protocol mainly by increased tubular reabsorption. It is concluded that neither ACE inhibition nor alpha 1-receptor blockade prevented or delayed the acute tolerance to furosemide. The results suggest that acute tolerance to furosemide can be induced through different but complementary homeostatic mechanisms in the kidney.",

The patient population consisted of 281 hypertensive men and women, 30-84 years old, with seated diastolic BP between 95 and 114 mmHg. The study was a two year multicenter (22 centers), open-label protocol of moexipril monotherapy or combination therapy (with hydrochlorothiazide).

The primary measure of efficacy was change from baseline in seated DBP. Secondary outcome measures included changes in seated SBP, heart rate, laboratory parameters and subjective complaints. Following one year of therapy in 183 patients, the BP fell 13/14 mmHg among patients receiving moexipril monotherapy and 18/15 mmHg those receiving combined therapy compared with baseline (P < 0.001 for both). After two years of treatment, reductions were similar in 161 patients. Forty-four (16%) patients were prematurely withdrawn from the study because of inadequate therapeutic response and 34 (12%) secondary to adverse experiences.

This study was designed to see if a low fat diet altered the favourable effect of doxazosin on blood lipids in adults with mild to moderate hypertension and mild to moderate hypercholesterolaemia (5.6-8.0 mmol/l). Following a six week period on a low fat diet, patients were randomly allocated to additional doxazosin (2-8 mg/day) or enalapril (5-20 mg/day) treatment for a further 10 weeks. Forty-four of 55 subjects completed the study. A low fat diet reduced mean body weight by 2 kg without significantly altering blood lipids (total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Doxazosin (4.5 +/- 2.9 mg/day) and enalapril (12.5 +/- 6.5 mg/day) produced a comparable lowering of sitting and standing BP at all visits and also produced similar 24h BP control. The expected increase in HDL cholesterol concentration previously noted in this patient population in association with doxazosin treatment was not detected suggesting that the low cholesterol-high carbohydrate diet, at least acutely, attenuates this potentially beneficial effect on plasma lipids.

An effective dosage of norepinephrine that increased MAP by 20 mmHg (EDNE 20) was thereafter calculated.

However, the effects of antihypertensive agents on renal hemodynamics have only been investigated at rest. To test whether antihypertensive therapy leads to disparate renal hemodynamic effects during exposure to mental stress as opposed to resting conditions, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. In 17 normotensive healthy men, glomerular filtration rate (GFR; inulin clearance) and renal plasma flow (RPF; para-aminohippuric acid clearance) were measured at rest and after a standardized mental stress test, with or without one week's treatment with a new, long-acting ACE-inhibitor cilazapril 2.5 mg/day. ACE-inhibition did not change resting blood pressure, RPF, GFR, or derived parameters, such as filtration fraction, renal vascular resistance and renal fraction of cardiac output. Mental stress caused an acute increase in GFR (p < 0.001) and filtration fraction with both treatments (0.001). However, the increase in GFR and filtration with mental stress was greater (p < 0.05) with cilazapril treatment than with placebo. Thus, renal hemodynamic responses to mental stress were influenced by ACE inhibitors. We conclude that the impact of antihypertensive agents on renal hemodynamics during stress cannot a priori be delineated from measurements at rest.",

Enalapril (5 mg once daily) and captopril (12.5 mg t.i.d.) were administered to 11 patients for 1 week each in a crossover fashion. Blood sampling in the early morning and 4-hour split urinary sampling for 24 hours were performed on the last day of control and each treatment periods. Enalapril and captopril significantly reduced blood pressure to similar levels. Enalapril but not captopril significantly inhibited plasma aldosterone concentration and urinary aldosterone excretion. Neither drug apparently altered serum or urinary Na levels. Both drugs significantly decreased urinary K excretion (p < 0.05, control: 44 +/- 4 mEq/day, captopril: 39 +/- 2 mEq/day, enalapril: 39 +/- 2 mEq/day; mean +/- SEM), but did not significantly alter serum K level (control: 4.1 +/- 0.1 mEq/l, captopril 4.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/l, enalapril 4.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/l). The circadian rhythm (acrophase) of urinary K excretion was not affected by either drug, while the amplitude was decreased by both, as assessed by the cosinor method. In summary, although enalapril caused more sustained inhibition of aldosterone secretion compared with captopril, both drugs showed similar effects on the K homeostasis in patients with mild essential hypertension.",

None the less, the three mortality curves tended to diverge progressively and the improvement in survival in the different groups was still significant after stratification for the severity of the disease, suggesting that treatment had a sustained effect. A progressively higher proportion of patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and more recently with beta blockers. In group 2, after stratification for the severity of heart failure, patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a better survival than patients who were not. Furthermore, analysis of group 3 showed that beta blockers had a significant additive effect with conventional therapy both by intention to treat and actual treatment.

This randomized and double blind clinical study analysed 50 patients with an inferior myocardial infarction. The effect of enalapril was evaluated through cardiac volumes, ejection fraction, neurohormonal levels and incidence of the left ventricle disfunction after acute myocardial infarction. The patients treated with enalapril showed a significant reduction on the values of nor-epinefrine, angiotensine II, natriuretic hormone and vasopressine, four weeks after initiation of treatment. The ejection fraction and the level of the wall movement was more favourable, four weeks after infarction, in the group treated with enalapril. The incidence of congestive heart failure and arrhythmias was lower in the group treated with enalapril. So, we conclude that enalapril is a drug that prevents the excessive remodelling of the left ventricle after an acute myocardial infarction.",

The reduction in proteinuria was not related to a significant fall in systemic blood pressure or a change in renal function.

Serum creatinine was normal before starting the ACE inhibitor and on discharge from hospital. The patient was re-admitted a week later with gross fluid retention and in renal failure. In the absence of alternative causes, a diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-induced renal failure was made and treatment was stopped. The patient required haemodialysis for 2 days and within 1 week the renal function had reverted to normal and has remained so for 1 year.

In high dose isoprenaline infusion, not only was extracellular matrix mRNA but also TGF-beta 1 mRNA in the ventricle significantly increased. TCV-116 prevented isoprenaline induced left ventricular hypertrophy as much as delapril. However, with delapril or TCV-116, the time course of TGF-beta 1 and ECM mRNA expression was almost similar to isoprenaline infusion only.",

The preventive effects of TCV-116 on this hypertrophy indicate that the inhibitory effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on cardiac hypertrophy are due to the inhibition of angiotensin II and that angiotensin II type I receptor plays an important role in isoprenaline induced left ventricular hypertrophy. However, the renin-angiotensin system may play a minor role in isoprenaline induced cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "443": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is now recognized to be a major and independent risk factor of mortality and morbidity. Although all classes of antihypertensives are able to reduce left ventricular mass, two recent metaanalyses have shown that ACE inhibitors are the most effective. The antihypertensive efficacy of perindopril in man is accompanied with a significant improvement in the functional properties of large arteries and with a reduction of LVH. This study was designed to assess the course of left ventricular mass by echocardiography in a population of 893 hypertensive patients with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, treated with perindopril for 3 months. A significant fall in blood pressure was observed by the 6th week. The morphological and functional echocardiographic parameters on a large population provided more valid statistical results than in a small series. The left ventricular cavity was found to undergo symmetrical remodelling, adapted to the new haemodynamic status. The reduction of the thickness of the wall was in line with the reduction of the size of the ventricular chamber, and left ventricular mass was reduced by 8% (p < 0.001). Systolic function was preserved and diastolic function was improved. In particular, the E/A ratio was increased by 8% (p < 0.001) and the duration of isometric relaxation was decreased by 11 ms (p < 0.02). This improvement of filling was confirmed by the reduction of the diameter of the left atrium by 0.2 mm (p < 0.001). This open study in 893 patients therefore confirmed that perindopril corrects LVH in hypertensive patients.",

The cytosolic PKC activity in crude samples of aortic media of SHR was higher than in those of WKY or enal-SHR (p < 0.01) and was closely associated with blood pressure (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). The membrane PKC activity was detected in samples of SHR, but virtually no activity was detected in samples of WKY or enal-SHR. The cytosolic PKC activity in DEAE column purified samples of SHR was also higher than in those of WKY or enal-SHR (p < 0.01). The PKC alpha enzyme levels (74-kDa and 77-kDa protein) detected by immunoblot were higher in SHR than in WKY or enal-SHR (p < 0.01). The mRNA levels of PKC alpha were higher in SHR than in WKY (p < 0.01) and were much decreased in enal-SHR (p < 0.01). Thus, PKC activity, PKC alpha and its mRNA levels were higher in aortic media of SHR than those in WKY and these increased levels were reversed with enalapril treatment. Considering the pivotal roles of PKC in the mechanism of cellular proliferation and the pathogenesis of hypertension, these results provide clues in understanding the pathogenesis of hypertension, mechanisms of vascular hypertrophy in hypertension and the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in the treatment of hypertension.",

In the present study, we evaluated the role of endogenously produced bradykinin (BK) in the stimulation of ischemically sensitive visceral afferents. Single-unit activity of abdominal visceral C fiber afferents was recorded from the right thoracic sympathetic chain of anesthetized cats during 5 min of abdominal ischemia. Abdominal ischemia increased the portal venous plasma BK level from 49 +/- 10 to 188 +/- 66 pg/ml (P < 0.05). Injection of BK (1 microgram/kg ia) into the descending aorta significantly increased impulse activity (0.88 +/- 0.16 impulses/s) of 10 C fibers, whereas a kinin B1-receptor agonist, des-Arg9-BK (1 microgram/kg), did not alter the discharge rate. Inhibition of kininase II activity with captopril (4 mg/kg i.v.) potentiated impulse activity of 14 ischemically sensitive C fibers (0.44 +/- 0.09 vs. precaptopril, 0.33 +/- 0.08 impulses/s; P < 0.05). In addition, a kinin B2-receptor antagonist (NPC-17731; 40 micrograms/kg i.v.) attenuated activity of afferents during ischemia (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs. pre-NPC-17731, 0.72 +/- 0.13 impulses/s; P < 0.05) and eliminated the response of 10 C fibers to BK. Another kinin B2-receptor antagonist, Hoe-140 (30 micrograms/kg iv), had similar inhibitory effects on six other ischemically sensitive C fibers. In 15 separate cats treated with aspirin (50 mg/kg i.v.), Hoe-140 (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) attenuated impulse activity of only 3 of 16 ischemically sensitive C fibers. These data suggest that BK produced during abdominal ischemia contributes to the stimulation of ischemically sensitive visceral C fiber afferents through kinin B2 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the CS group, each parameter, including serum potassium, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone concentrations, is within the normal range. However, plasma renin activity in the CS group was lower than that in the RVH group but higher than that in the PA group, and plasma aldosterone concentration was lower than that in each RVH or PA group. These findings indicated that the CS group had a different type of hypertension from that in either RVH or PA, in which the renin angiotensin system or mineralocorticoids play an important role in hypertension. Meanwhile, captopril (50 mg) administration either with or without indomethacin pretreatment decreased the mean blood pressure in the CS group, although captopril failed to change it in the PA group or in normal subjects. Furthermore, the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin II in the CS group was higher than that in the RVH or EH group, but was not different from that in the PA group. Thus, the hypertension in patients with CS due to adrenocortical adenoma appears to be mediated through a change in the renin-angiotensin system in the form of exaggerated pressor responses to angiotensin II.",

I believe this to be the case with the drug class of ACEIs. There are mammalian models suggesting substantial fetotoxicity in a dose-related fashion. There is a strong and consistent pattern to the reported cases of ACEI-related adverse outcomes: the syndrome of oligohydramnios-anuria, neonatal hypotension, renal dysplasia, and hypocalvaria is too specific in association with the use of these drugs to be ignored. There is a very plausible biologic mechanism to explain the relationship. The features of ACEI fetopathy suggest that the underlying pathogenetic mechanism is fetal hypotension, which may also result from other exposures. Thus, while the fetopathy may not be truly specific to ACEIs, they are particularly liable to produce adverse fetal renal effects with their sequels (anuria-oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, growth restriction) and hypocalvaria.",

Sixty-five out of 102 patients randomized to flosequinan and 43 out of 107 randomized to captopril (p < 0.001) did not complete the study. There was no difference between the groups in mortality: 19 patients died while taking flosequinan and 15 while taking captopril. Both drugs had similar effects on treadmill exercise tolerance; the mean increase at week 52 was 117 seconds in the flosequinan group and 156 seconds (p = 0.57) for the captopril group. For those patients stratified to the corridor walk test only, there was also very little difference in the improvement at 52 weeks; the mean increase for patients randomized to flosequinan was 61 meters and captopril was 75 meters (p = 0.65). However, when the walk tests from all patients are examined, captopril produced a significant improvement compared with flosequinan at week 52 (p = 0.015). Flosequinan has similar long-term efficacy to captopril but is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events.",

The mean baseline infusion of 63 ng/kg/5 min resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the ratio of AII to AI plasma levels from 0.52 +/- 0.46 to 7.92 +/- 4.48 and a SBP increase of 120 +/- 7.1 to 147 +/- 5.6. Within 15 minutes of starting the 1-mg infusion of libenzapril over 1.5 hours, the AII/AI ratio decreased to baseline values, and the SBP had returned to baseline in 1 hour. Repeat AI challenges at 3.5 and 5 hours postdose did not increase SBP significantly. Even the 6.5-hour challenge demonstrated only a slight increase in SBP, with an AII/AI ratio of 0.26. At 24 hours, SBP was only 40% of the baseline response, demonstrating that libenzapril is a potent long-acting ACE inhibitor.", 
    "475": "In most cases, the antihypertensive therapy for an individual patient is selected through a process of trial and error. This study determined if, by treating each hypertensive patient sequentially, with six antihypertensive drugs, one from each of the major classes, one could decide on the best possible drug for control of hypertension. In a randomized open-label crossover study, 19 patients (16 male and 3 female), 28-70 years of age with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95-110 mm Hg were given atenolol, captopril, clonidine, indapamide, prazosin, and verapamil in a sequential manner. Each drug was started at the minimum recommended or lower dose and titrated upwards every 2 weeks, if well tolerated, until blood pressure was controlled (diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If blood pressure was controlled, the drug was continued for another 2 weeks. A washout period of at least 2 weeks was allowed between drugs. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly with all of the six drugs. In 18 of the 19 patients, blood pressure was controlled with at least one of six drugs, frequently with the lowest dose. The authors conclude that if hypertension is not controlled with the lowest recommended dose of a drug, other antihypertensive drugs should be tried sequentially rather than increasing the dose or adding a second drug.", 
    "476": "Concomitant use of antacid preparations with other medications is common. The potential for antacid-drug interactions is dependent upon the chemistry and physical properties of the antacid preparation. The intragastric release of free aluminum and magnesium ions has potent effects on gastrointestinal function and on drug pharmacokinetics. Antacid-drug interactions may occur secondary to changes in gastrointestinal motility or alterations in gastric and urinary pH. Direct adsorption also results in decreased drug bioavailability. Human drug interaction studies are usually performed with healthy volunteers; extrapolation of these results to clinical situations may not always be valid. However, the current literature would suggest that significant interactions with antacids do occur with certain members of the quinolone, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and cephalosporin classes of drugs. Notable interactions also occur with tetracycline, quinidine, ketoconazole and oral glucocorticoids. These interactions are particularly relevant in the patient with sepsis, cardiac disease or inflammatory syndromes.", 
    "477": "Hearts with pressure-overload hypertrophy show an increased intracardiac activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which may contribute to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. This study investigates whether the hypertrophied myocardium is more vulnerable to ischemia and reperfusion injury and whether the specific inhibition of the cardiac RAS by captopril would modify ischemia and reperfusion injury in the hypertrophied myocardium. By using the isolated working rat heart model, hypertrophied hearts, induced by abdominal aortic banding for 6 weeks, were subjected to 120 min of hypothermic ischemic arrest followed by 30 min of reperfusion. The postischemic cardiac function recovery was measured in both the untreated (n = 10) and the captopril-treated (n = 11) groups and was compared with that of the sham-operated non-hypertrophied control hearts (n = 10). Captopril (23.0 microM) was given to one group with the hypertrophied hearts from the beginning of ischemia to the end of reperfusion. In comparison with the normal control hearts, the cardiac function recovery after 30 min reperfusion was poorer in the hypertrophied hearts, which was associated with a lower recovery of coronary flow (CF), a higher myocardial lactate content and a retarded peak myocardial creatinkinase (CK) release. Captopril significantly improved the cardiac function recovery, which was associated with an increased CF recovery and a lower myocardial lactate content, and a rapid peak CK release. In conclusion, this study shows that the hypertrophied myocardium leads to an increased susceptibility to ischemia and reperfusion injury. Captopril, most likely by its inhibition of the cardiac RAS, is effective in preventing the ischemia and reperfusion injury in the hypertrophied heart.", 
    "478": "Fosinopril is distinguished from other ACE inhibitors by a pharmacokinetic pecularity in the sense that is can be metabolized either by liver or kidney. This was the rationale of the present research the aim of which was to verify if administered to patients with liver cirrhosis the drug was liable to alter global liver function and ability to metabolize drugs. Eight cirrhotic males, mean age 56 years, also suffering from high blood pressure, were studied. In these patients, liver and kidney function tests (BUN, creatinine blood level, serum and urinary electrolytes, creatinine clearance, calcium and phosphor blood level, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase prothrombin time, cholinesterase, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase) were carried out at baseline and after 30 days' fosinopril treatment (1 capsule every morning in the fasting state); in addition total functioning liver mass was assessed by the galactose test, and drug-metabolizing capacity by the antipyrine test. Treatment resulted in a significant improvement of pressure values in all patients (p < 0.01) and did not alter liver and kidney function parameters. Besides, no side effects were registered, especially no case of orthostatic hypotension. The antipyrine test was not influenced by fosinopril treatment. Therefore, short-term treatment with this ACE-inhibitor can be concluded to be effective and not to cause additional alterations of liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "479": "In order to assess the significance of drug levels measured in clinical and forensic toxicology as well as for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), it is essential that good collections of data are readily available. For more than 400 frequently used drugs therapeutic and, if data were available, toxic and fatal plasma concentrations as well as elimination half-lives were compiled in a table including, e.g., hypnotics like barbiturates and benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, sedatives, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, antihistamines, anti-epileptics, beta-adrenergic antagonists, antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors), diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, anti-arrhythmics, anti-asthmatics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, opioid agonists, and local anaesthetics. Data have been abstracted from published information, both compilations and primary sources, and supplemented with data collected in our own forensic and clinical toxicology laboratories. Wherever possible, ranges for therapeutic plasma concentrations are expressed as trough concentration at steady-state. The range of (or single) half-life values given for each drug are chosen to represent the terminal log-linear phase at most. In addition to the assessment of significance of drug levels for the therapeutic monitoring of patients, this list can assist the diagnostic assessment in cases of intoxication.", 
    "480": "Severe renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a relatively uncommon complication following renal transplantation but is a curable cause of hypertension which demands reliable early diagnosis to reduce morbidity, mortality and graft loss. Captopril renography has been used for a number of years as a method of detecting RAS mainly in native kidneys, with only a few studies concerning the transplant situation. Controversy still exists as to the diagnostic accuracy of this test and as to the most appropriate interpretation criteria with which to establish a positive result. This paper reports the evaluation of 26 captopril renography investigations on hypertensive renal transplant patients with a suspected diagnosis of RAS. Each renogram study was correlated with an arteriogram as the 'gold standard' which was undertaken within 28 days of the renography. A sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 88% were achieved by including a consideration of the change in perfusion to the kidney between pre- and post-challenge studies. It is concluded that captopril renography is a useful screening test for the detection of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS).", 
    "481": "All the components of the renin-angiotensin system have been identified in the heart including the angiotensin II receptor subtypes AT1 and AT2. In the normal human heart, there is a decreasing receptor density from the right atrium to the left ventricle. In right atrial membranes prepared from pathological hearts, the percentage of AT1 receptor decreases with the severity of cardiac dysfunction whereas that of AT2 receptor increases. Treatment of hypertrophic rats with AT1 receptor antagonists inhibits cardiac hypertrophy and reverses the increase receptor density, indicating involvement of this Ang II receptor subtype. The role of the AT2 receptor is still largely unknown but it may be involved in cell growth and proliferation. The cloning of both AT1 and AT2 receptors as well as the availability of potent and selective antagonists will help us to understand better the functional role of Angiotensin II in cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "482": "With the development of subtype specific angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists and their introduction into the treatment of heart failure and hypertension, the regulation of the Ang II receptor with its subtypes AT1 and Ang T2 gains clinical importance. In cell cultures, the number of surface AT1 is clearly down-regulated by Ang II exposure. Down-regulation can be due to reversible internalization, to phosphorylation and to reduced synthesis and involves protein kinase C and phospholipase C mediated pathways. In this respect, the AT1 behaves as a typical G-protein coupled receptor. Aldosterone, cAMP, norepinephrine and extracellular glucose concentrations can contribute to AT1 regulation. There are very few data regarding the regulation of the subtype AT2, indicating modulation by a number of growth factors and by Ang II. In whole animal models receptor regulation deviates partially from cell cultures. In the rat, the two subtypes AT1A and AT1B are differentially regulated and the expression of subtypes is organ specific. In most experiments, including our own experiences, the AT1, in the adrenals was up-regulated by Ang II infusion and down-regulated by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or Ang II receptor antagonists. Differing effects were observed in other organs. In humans, a number of studies seeking an association between Ang II levels, Ang II receptor regulation and physiological events have been conducted in platelets. In pregnant women, a negative correlation between plasma Ang II levels and Ang II binding and an association between receptor regulation and pregnancy-induced hypertension has been described.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "483": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor heterogeneity is currently defined by the new subtype-selective agents, losartan (AT1) and PD123177 (AT2). Although both subtypes have been cloned and sequenced, only the AT1 receptor has been shown to have an important physiological or pathophysiological role. AT1 and AT2 receptors are found in both normal and failing cardiac tissue. They are found on myocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, coronary arterial smooth muscle cells, and peripheral sympathetic nerves. The AT1 receptors mediate virtually all of the effects of Ang II in myocytes even though cardiac tissue may contain over 50% AT2 sites. In endothelial cells, functional responses are predominately AT1. In fibroblasts, preliminary data suggest that AT2 receptors may be involved in collagen synthesis. In isolated tissue, Ang II has a limited positive inotropic effect in atrial, but not in ventricular tissue, which is blocked by losartan. Ang II may also have a tonic effect on coronary artery resistance as angiotensin inhibitors can increase coronary flow. Both ACE (Ang II synthesis) inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists produce beneficial effects in experimental models of heart failure, suggesting Ang II is an important mediator of heart failure. Because ACE inhibitors also potentiate bradykinin and are non-specific inhibitors of Ang II synthesis (availability of Ang II to both receptor subtypes) some differences can be anticipated. At the present time, however, the beneficial role of bradykinin is controversial and the predominant functional Ang II receptor in the heart and other tissues is the AT1 subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "484": "Several intervention studies with angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have demonstrated a remarkable improvement in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension and congestive heart failure. Since ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with congestive heart failure not only improves systemic haemodynamics but also provides a better prognosis, the cardiac renin-angiotensin system is apparently one of the major targets of ACE inhibitor therapy. Recent studies provided evidence that the human heart contains high affinity Ang II (Ang II) receptors with both subtype population and ACE. In addition to ACE, a novel cardiac Ang II forming enzyme (human chymase) has been identified in human hearts. Unlike in the rat heart, the minor (10%) component of Ang II-forming activity in the left ventricle is due to ACE, whereas the major (80%) component is due to human chymase. This novel cardiac serine proteinase has been purified from the human left ventricle and characterized, and recently, the cDNA and the gene for this enzyme have been cloned. Biochemical characterization revealed that human chymase is the most efficient and specific Ang II-forming enzyme described thus far, but the cellular and regional distribution of the two Ang II-forming enzymes seems to be different. ACE is mainly localized in endothelial cells and fibroblasts and the expression level is higher in atria than ventricles, whereas chymase is synthesized and stored in secretory granules of mast cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells, and after its secretion localized in the interstitial region of the myocardium and its expression is higher in ventricles than atria. These results imply distinct roles of these two Ang II-forming enzymes in cardiac Ang II formation and in the physiological function of the human heart. Since localization of cardiac renin and angiotensinogen were also identified in human heart, it is important to understand the detailed mechanisms of the tissue Ang II formation and its contribution to the pathophysiological changes in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "485": "Numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II has distinctive cellular effects in the cardiovascular system, independent from its effects on blood pressure. These have led to the hypothesis that activation of the angiotensin system in the heart could be of functional relevance for the adaptive processes in several cardiovascular disorders, such as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. This concept has been supported by clinical studies showing the beneficial effects of blockers of the system such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in these circumstances. In order to study the regulation of gene expression of renin angiotensin system components in cardiac disorders we have performed two studies. First, we investigated the gene expression of ACE in human heart failure. Results showed that the enzyme is activated locally in this condition, supporting previous studies in animals. Second, in a different approach, we asked whether the selective activation of the renin angiotensin system in the hearts of transgenic rats expressing an additional renin gene leads to the development of pathological changes in the cardiovascular system. The results of this study demonstrated that the transgenic animals developed cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure independent of the increase in blood pressure seen in these rats. Taken together, these studies provide further evidence for the functional role of local angiotensin systems in the heart.", 
    "486": "Neurohormonal activation is one of the major determining factors in the process of transition from asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction to end-stage heart failure, in the prognosis of heart failure, and in the efficacy and, hence, choice and timing of pharmacological therapy. Although various counteracting hormonal systems are involved, emphasis in terms of functionality is on vasopressor and growth-promoting systems. In contrast, ANF and N-terminal proANF probably have a significant prognostic value, even at an early stage. The focus of heart failure therapy is moving from measures aimed at improving cardiac function to ones that concentrate on modulating neuroendocrine changes during failure and their effects on intrinsic peripheral and cardiac alterations. Although ACE inhibition undoubtedly constitutes a major step forward in this approach, alternative ways to modulate neurohormonal activation pharmacologically are needed. Several such novel approaches are being developed, including angiotensin receptor antagonists, dopaminergic stimulation, neutral endopeptidase inhibition, aldosterone antagonism and beta blockade. In addition to their positive inotropic properties digitalis glycosides may act as neurohormonal modulators. Finally, the realization that several well-established forms of heart failure therapy may aggravate neuroendocrine stimulation demands careful consideration as to whether such agents are really necessary, and underlines the desirability of co-administering neurohormonal modulating therapy.", 
    "487": "It is difficult to establish dose-response relationships for ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure. This has led to the widely held opinion that the effects of ACE inhibitors are hardly dose dependent. The purpose of this short discussion is to demonstrate that this class of compounds, as well as the more recent angiotensin II receptor antagonists, exhibit some very clear dose-response relationships when these are evaluated in normal volunteers based on the mechanisms for which they were designed. Characterization of these dose-response curves is important in order to use these drugs at their optimal dose and to obtain the maximal therapeutic benefit.", 
    "488": "Early treatment with ACE inhibitors of even moderate heart failure is clinically beneficial, even though haemodynamic measurements cannot adequately quantitate such improvement. Neurohumoral assessment is, however, supposed to be more accurate. In 55 patients with moderate heart failure (ejection fraction < or = 35%), we investigated the dose-dependent effects of ACE inhibition with quinapril taken orally (2.5, 5 or 10 mg b.i.d.) following a placebo-controlled, parallel design protocol over 12 weeks. Plasma components of the renin angiotensin system, catecholamines and ANF were measured together with haemodynamics both at rest and during exercise. Before ACE inhibitor treatment, median PRA, Ang I and II and catecholamines were normal, while ANF was increased. All these parameters, including ACE activity, rose during exercise. Chronic inhibition of ACE activity was dose-dependent and the maximal fall in Ang II occurred with quinapril 20 mg.day-1. Humoral changes appeared more assessible than haemodynamic alterations even though many of these changes were reasonably correlated. The effects of chronic ACE inhibition on circulating neurohumoral components in patients with moderate heart failure are small and dose-dependent. Since humoral changes are related to haemodynamics they should account for the clinical benefit. Appropriately high doses of ACE inhibitors should be chosen for treatment of heart failure.",

    "490": "Previous studies in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) treated with diuretics and/or digoxin have shown abnormalities of cellular volume and electrolytes in biopsies of skeletal muscle. These abnormalities seem to play an important role with regard to the dysregulation of peripheral vascular resistance and characteristic clinical features of CHF, for example, muscular weakness. This study assessed the effect of angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy on cell volume and cell volume regulation in patients with CHF. Cell diameters of human mononuclear leukocytes (HML) were determined electronically by a Coulter Counter. Cell diameters for 19 patients with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (determined via levocardiography) on therapy with ACE inhibitors (group 1) were compared to those of HML from patients on diuretics alone (group 2, n = 16). The activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter was determined by cell swelling in isotonic propionate. The control group consisted of 20 normal, age- and sex-matched volunteers. HML diameters were significantly increased from 7.16 +/- 0.07 in normals to 7.24 +/- 0.08 microns (group 1; P < 0.01) and 7.23 +/- 0.11 microns (group 2; P < 0.05), indicating an abnormal regulation of cell volume. There were no statistically significant correlations between the individual ejection fraction or digoxin therapy and average cell diameters. In both patient groups ethylisopropylamiloride-sensitive swelling rates were normal compared to the control group indicating a normal activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter. In conclusion, increased cell sizes reflect a structural change in HML rather than a rapidly reversible functional abnormality which was not affected different by ACE inhibition and diuretic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Other causes of hypotension, such as myocardial infarction and sepsis was ruled out. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was the probable cause of hypotension. This case demonstrates the critical importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in the maintenance of blood pressure in tetraplegic patients, who may lack input from the brain to sympathetic neurons, and therefore have increased reliance on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis for the maintenance of blood pressure.

    "506": "Animal studies show that the renin-angiotensin system contributes to hypertension, glomerulosclerosis and progressive chronic renal failure in renal disease. Direct data on the activity of the renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in human renal disease are scarce, however. The small amount of tissue in renal biopsies and insufficient sensitivity of analytical methods have precluded reliable measurements of the tissue components of the RAS in the past. Due to its highly sensitivity the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assay today allows the quantitation of gene transcription products in small tissue samples, for example, renal biopsies. The clinical applicability of the PCR has raised the interest in this methodology. We adopted quantitative PCR to study expression and regulation of the renin gene in patients with different forms of glomerulonephritis. For PCR a deletion mutant of the renin gene was used as an internal standard exhibiting the same primer binding sites as the human gene. The number of glomeruli per biopsy sample was counted by microscopic transillumination immediately after biopsy and was used as a reference base. Renin mRNA was expressed as fg per glomerulus. Compared to nonaffected tissue of tumor nephrectomy samples, renin gene expression was significantly lower in glomerulonephritic patients without converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) treatment, that is, 63 +/- 20 (6) versus 250 +/- 50 (7) (P < 0.02), although plasma renin concentration was in the normal range.

To this end the left renal arteries of male Sprague-Dawley rats were clipped with 0.2 mm silver clips and renal renin mRNA levels were assayed by RNase protection during the first ten days after clipping. Unilateral reduction of renal blood flow led to transient maximal fivefold increases of renin mRNA levels in the clipped kidneys and to sustained suppression of renin gene expression to 20% of the control value in the contralateral intact kidneys. Inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) formation by meclofenamate or EDRF synthesis by L-NAME markedly attenuated the increase of renin mRNA levels in response to clipping, and a combination of PG/EDRF inhibition almost abolished the increase of renin mRNA levels. Inhibition of PG/EDRF formation did not change the suppression of renin mRNA levels in the contralateral intact kidneys. Neither did renal denervation nor inhibition of macula densa function by furosemide prevent the suppression of renin gene expression in response to unilateral renal artery clipping. Only converting enzyme inhibition by ramipril and blockade of Ang II-AT1 receptors by losartan attenuated the decrease of renin mRNA levels in the contralaterals to clipped kidneys.

Clinical assessment alone is inadequate to distinguish systolic from diastolic failure, and echocardiography is an essential investigation in the management of these patients. From a therapeutic standpoint an alternative approach to treatment is likely to be indicated, and the results of recent major trials in systolic heart failure cannot necessarily be extrapolated to this group of patients.", 
    "509": "Pharmacological therapy in cases of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is usually evaluated by maximal exercise time. To assess the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, 223 patients with moderate CHF were studied in 24 centres in four Nordic countries in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. The study drug was titrated from 1.25 mg to a maximum of 10 mg once daily (o.d) over a period of 4 weeks (mean dose 8 mg). A symptom-limited bicycle exercise test, starting at 30 watts and increasing by 10 watts.min-1, was used to evaluate exercise capacity. Reproducible tests were required at baseline, and the test was repeated after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. Seven deaths were recorded in the placebo group and one death in the ramipril group. A total of 195 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment (placebo group n = 91, ramipril group n = 104). The groups had similar baseline characteristics. Maximal exercise time was increased by mean (SD) 35 s (9) and 41 s (8) in the placebo and ramipril groups, respectively. The adjusted difference between the groups at 12 weeks was 9 s (12) (ns). A significant decrease in blood pressure and rate-pressure product at rest and at end of exercise was obtained by ramipril as compared with placebo. Significantly fewer patients deteriorated in NYHA class from baseline to 12 weeks of ramipril treatment compared to placebo (P = 0.012). Concomitant medication for CHF increased significantly in the placebo group as compared with ramipril-treated patients (P = 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation Study (TRACE) patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function were randomized 3-7 days post MI to receive either the ACE inhibitor trandolapril, or placebo. Twenty-seven Danish centres participated and 7001 consecutive MI patients were screened for entry. Local doctors and technicians who had received a brief but thorough training course recorded a two-dimensional echocardiographic examination on videotape 2-6 days after MI. Within 24 h, wall motion index (WMI) was visually assessed by one of two cardiologists (examiners) with considerable experience in echocardiography. A WMI of < or = 1.2 (corresponding to a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or = 0.35) meant that the patient was eligible for randomization in the TRACE study. Two other experienced cardiologists with substantial experience in echocardiography (controllers) performed blind reassessment of 155 randomly chosen videotapes. We showed that 93% of the 7001 screened MIs had an assessable echocardiogram. WMI was < or = 1.2 in 37% of patients. The one-year mortality was inversely related to WMI, being 60%, 30%, 14% and 11% in patients with a WMI < 0.8, 0.8-1.2, 1.3-1.6 and > 1.6, respectively. In the random sample of 155 videorecordings that were reevaluated, 97% were found to be technically adequate for analysis both by the examiners and the controllers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "511": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. However, despite the demonstrated clinical benefits many physicians are reluctant to prescribe ACE-inhibitors to the mostly elderly heart failure patients due to concern for side effects which may be related to ACE-inhibitor-induced bradykinin accumulation. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists may provide more effective blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system without causing bradykinin accumulation and thus associated side effects. The potential benefits of treating heart failure patients with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist instead of or in addition to an ACE-inhibitor are discussed.", 
    "512": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in both cardiovascular homeostasis and diseases. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used very successfully in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. The therapeutic effectiveness of these drugs has been ascribed to their action in limiting the activity of the RAS and suggests that other pharmacological mechanisms that block this system, such as angiotensin II receptor inhibitors, could also be of benefit. Some properties of angiotensin II receptor inhibitors offer potential advantages over ACE-inhibitors. ACE acts on other substrates in addition to angiotensin I (i.e. bradykinin) so that more specific inhibition of the RAS can be achieved with selective angiotensin II antagonists. Data on the existence of both circulating and tissue RAS have been reported, and non-ACE pathways for angiotensin II production have also been described. So, by inhibiting the interaction of the biological active peptide at its receptor level, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist will inhibit the RAS independently of the source or route of angiotensin II synthesis. Peptide angiotensin II antagonists were first reported 20 years ago and the best studied was saralasine; they are potent and selective blockers of angiotensin II responses, but their lack of oral activity, short duration of action and the concomitant partial agonistic activity limited their clinical use. Now are available nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonists with attributes appropriate for clinical development. The preliminary evaluation of these new selective nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonists show their potential therapeutic role in many cardiovascular diseases in which the RAS is involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "513": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the primary mediator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Inappropriate control of the RAS is critically involved in the development and maintenance of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The actions of Ang II are thought to be mediated by specific surface receptors on the various target organs. At present, two receptors for Ang II have been firmly established in mammals, including man. According to current nomenclature, losartan represents the prototype antagonist of the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor and does not possess significant affinity for the so-called AT2 receptor. Losartan is the first of a new class of orally active, nonpeptide Ang II receptor antagonists able to very specifically and selectively inhibit the RAS while lacking the agonistic effects of the peptide receptor antagonists, e.g. sarlasin, or the bradykinin potentiating effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Virtually all of the known actions of Ang II, e.g. those defined by Ang II itself, saralasin, ACE or renin-inhibitors are blocked by losartan, emphasizing the major role of this distinct Ang II receptor subtype in mediating the responses of Ang II. The functional correlate of the AT2 receptor remains poorly understood. In several models of experimental and genetic hypertension, AT1 receptor antagonists are effective antihypertensive agents with similar efficacy to that of ACE and renin-inhibitors. In animal models of renal disease, AT1 receptor antagonists significantly decrease proteinuria, protect against diabetic glomerulopathy and increase survival in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "514": "Left ventricular remodeling post-infarction occurs in at least a third of patients post-infarction and is associated with diminished survival and an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. This process, which has been well described in recent years, can be largely attenuated with the use of ACE-inhibitors and with it survival improved and adverse events minimized. Since it is currently not possible to identify people at risk from left ventricular remodeling, ACE-inhibitors should be administered to all patients within the first 48 hours of infarction.", 
    "515": "We have considered the possibility that the association between Ca(2+)-antagonists and ACE-inhibitors may be useful to treat patients with myocardial infarction. The two classes of drugs have synergic and complementary effects in terms of mechanism and site of action and of cardioprotective properties. In clinical trials Ca(2+)-antagonists failed to improve prognosis of patients with myocardial infarction, except verapamil which reduces mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and without pulmonary congestion. ACE-inhibitors are effective only in patients with myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Thus the two classes of drugs could be useful to treat patients with myocardial infarction but this hypothesis has to be confirmed with properly designed clinical trials.", 
    "516": "Experimental and clinical findings showing a beneficial effect on ventricular remodelling have led to a widespread use of ACE-inhibitors in myocardial infarction. Recent trials (SAVE, AIRE, GISSI 3, ISIS 4) have clearly demonstrated that in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure the treatment with ACE-inhibitors is mandatory, although several questions remain unanswered. Recent experimental observations on the relationship between ACE and endothelial function, and between ACE and intimal proliferation have gone forward leading to new perspectives on the potential use of ACE-inhibitors in all patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "517": "In acute myocardial infarction, the results of the trials with ACE-inhibitors have not been always good, in contrast with what has been observed in chronic heart failure. The comparison of these compounds with the placebo has demonstrated lack of reduction of mortality in the study CONSENSUS II, favorable results on the survival as first endpoint and on the secondary endpoints, as reinfarction, heart failure and stroke in the studies SOLVD, AIRE, GISSI 3, ISIS 4, and uncertain (interim report) results in the Chinese study. Nevertheless, the analysis of the recruitment of the patients with acute infarction and the way these patients have been treated seem to be the most important cause of the conflicting results. ACE-inhibitors have proved no efficacy in acute myocardial infarction without signs of left ventricular failure (CONSENSUS II), have worsened the clinical picture and the mortality in patients in shock or with severe heart failure in the acute phase. On the reverse, in presence of mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction and failure, the use of ACE-inhibitors has been followed by reduction of mortality in the early (AIRE, GISSI 3, ISIS 4), medium term (GISSI 3) and long-term follow-up (up to 4 years in the AIRE study). In parallel with the reduction of the primary endpoint, also secondary endpoints have been favorably influenced by the different ACE-inhibitors. No differences have been observed among the different class of compounds. ACE-inhibitors seem, therefore, to have a clear indication in acute myocardial infarction with mild or moderate signs and symptoms of heart failure.", 
    "518": "Aim of recent experimental and clinical studies has been to evaluate the important role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, of vascular hypertrophy and of left ventricular fibrosis and remodelling in essential hypertension and ischemic heart disease. It has been suggested that ACE-inhibitors are the class of antihypertensive drugs more effective in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. The possible mechanisms are, beyond the decrease in blood pressure, the possibility of interfering not only with the renin-angiotensin system activity, but also with the sympathetic nervous system activity as well as with aortic distensibility, all factors that can influence the development of LVH. Vascular changes in essential hypertension are complex and depend not only on the severity of blood pressure levels, but are related to diameter and structure of the vessels and to the presence of other atherosclerosis risk factors. ACE-inhibitors are effective in inducing the regression of structural changes in resistance arterioles and furthermore can increase arterial compliance in large arteries; new studies are undergoing in order to assess the effects of these drugs on atherosclerotic plaque progression/regression. The results of large clinical trials have shown the efficacy of ACE-inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure, in addition, after it has been demonstrated that ACE-inhibitors can influence the structural remodelling process after myocardial infarction, their use has been extended to patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "519": "At least theoretically, ACE-inhibitors may influence each of the factors involved in the regulation of salt and water metabolism. Angiotensin II exerts an antidiuretic and antinatriuretic action on the kidney through influences on the glomerular filtration coefficient, glomerular filtration rate, mesangial tone, filtration fraction, proximal and distal tubule. Angiotensin II and renin also regulate the input of water and salt through an unequivocal dipsogenic effect. In congestive heart failure angiotensin II participates in the preservation of the glomerular filtration rate through its vasoconstrictor properties on the systemic vessels (maintenance of the perfusion and filtration pressure) as well as on the efferent arteriole (maintenance of the filtration pressure). ACE-inhibition weakens or abolishes these influences. However, two favorable mechanisms may also come into action: rise of cardiac output and improvement in renal blood flow; widening of the filtration surface and increment of the filtration coefficient. The efficacy of these factors depends on renal function, age, functional recovery of the heart, treatment with diuretics, duration of treatment with ACE-inhibitors, duration of action of the ACe-inhibitor used, blockade of the facilitating action on the adrenergic vasoconstriction, formation of vasodilating prostaglandins, reduced degradation of kinins. All these effects may account for the variable and often contradictory clinical results, in particular as concerns the relationship between ACE-inhibition and use of diuretics in congestive heart failure. This also explains the variability of efficacy (from the development of pulmonary edema and requirement of diuretics to diuretic withdrawal and clinical improvement) of the ACE-inhibitors as monotherapy in mild to moderate heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of ramipril (1 microgram/microliter) significantly reduced drinking in response to subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of isoprenaline (100 micrograms/kg) from 8.49 +/- 0.69 to 2.96 +/- 0.36 ml/2 h, polyethyleneglycol (PEG) (30% w/v, 10 ml/kg) from 9.51 +/- 2.20 to 1.6 +/- 0.34 ml/2 h or water deprivation for 24 h from 12.61 +/- 0.83 to 5.10 +/- 1.37 ml/2 h. Ramipril had no effect on water intake induced by cellular dehydration produced by sc injection of hypertonic saline (2 M NaCI). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ramipril acts as an ACE-blocking agent in the brain. The possibility that ramipril is transformed to ramiprilat, the active drug, by the brain is suggested.", 
    "521": "Inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with ramipril was studied in male Wistar rats during long-term inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Chronic treatment with L-NAME in a dose of 25 mg/kg per day over 6 weeks caused myocardial hypertrophy and a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (245 +/- 16 mmHg) as compared to controls (155 +/- 4 mmHg). Animals receiving simultaneously L-NAME and ramipril were protected against blood pressure increase and partially against myocardial hypertrophy. L-NAME caused a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR: 2.56 +/- 0.73 ml.kg-1.min-1) and renal plasma flow (RPF: 6.93 +/- 1.70 ml.kg-1.min-1) as compared to control (GFR: 7.29 +/- 0.69, RPF: 21.36 +/- 2.33 ml.kg-1.min-1). Addition of ramipril prevented L-NAME-induced reduction in GFR and renal plasma flow. L-NAME produced an elevation in urinary protein excretion and serum creatinine and a decrease in potassium excretion which was antagonised by ramipril. L-NAME-induced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) was further elevated with ramipril treatment. Isolated hearts from rats treated with L-NAME showed increased post-ischaemic reperfusion injuries. Compared to controls duration of ventricular fibrillation was increased and coronary flow reduced. During ischemia the cytosolic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase, as well as lactate in the venous effluent were increased. Myocardial tissue values of glycogen, ATP, and creatine phosphate were decreased, whereas lactate was increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In addition, the current treatment recommendations of Joint National Committee V (JNCV) are reflected in our discussion. The current drug classes are reviewed with respect to dosage guidelines, adverse effects and potential drug-drug interactions.

    "523": "Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon exhibit reversible digital vasospasm, often in response to cold. While this condition often responds to simple physical measures, in severe cases, symptoms may require drug treatment. Arterial vasodilators have usually been tried in clinical practice, but recently ACE inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials of this condition. Case studies, noncomparative and placebo-controlled studies have shown mixed results of ACE inhibitor therapy in Raynaud's phenomenon. While these drugs reduced symptoms in some patients, the results were not consistent. On objective measures of improvement, such as evaluation of digital blood flow patterns, consistent statistically significant changes have also not been shown. However, well conducted dose-titration studies have not been performed in patients with Reynaud's phenomenon, and the objective methods of assessing this condition require refinement. The mode of action of ACE inhibitors is promising and these agents do not have significant adverse effects in this population. While at present ACE inhibitors cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of Reynaud's phenomenon, further controlled studies with newer ACE inhibitors, which may have improved peripheral activity, may change this view.", 
    "524": "To clarify whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent progressive renal injury directly by their antihypertensive effect we administered the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to male MWF/Ztm rats as a single daily dose that lowered blood pressure for only 9 of 24 h. We investigated the effects of this treatment in short- and long-term studies and compared them with another antihypertensive drug, the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, given to partially control blood pressure as done with the ACE inhibitor. In untreated animals systemic hypertension, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis developed spontaneously with age, and lisinopril reduced systemic hypertension and prevented proteinuria and glomerular lesions. Nitrendipine, despite similar blood pressure control, was ineffective in preventing both proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. After 2 mo of treatment glomerular capillary pressure was significantly reduced by lisinopril and slightly but significantly increased by nitrendipine, compared with untreated controls. The ultrafiltration coefficient was significantly higher in lisinopril than in controls and not significantly changed by nitrendipine. With both drugs, however, glomerular hemodynamic effects were observed only at a few hours after administration and were abolished before the next administration. No significant changes in glomerular tuft volume were observed in treated and untreated animals after 2 and 6 mo of observation. Thus ACE inhibitor, despite only partial control of systemic blood pressure, effectively prevented proteinuria and glomerular injury. Comparable blood pressure control obtained with a calcium channel blocker was not associated with renal protection. These results suggest that ACE inhibitors could protect glomerular microcirculation by a mechanism that is not directly related to their antihypertensive action.", 
    "525": "In a randomized, double blind, parallel-group, multicentre study in Norway, 97 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (mean blood pressure 159/104 mm Hg) were treated with either lisinopril 10-40 mg or nifedipine 20-80 mg and the effects on blood lipids were evaluated. Complete results of laboratory analyses are given for 80 patients. After a 4 week run-in and placebo period, antihypertensive treatment was given for the next 10 weeks. During treatment with lisinopril the changes in lipids were +2.1% for total cholesterol, +0.7% for HDL-cholesterol, +3.8% for triglycerides and -6.1% for ratio HDL/cholesterol-HDL. For nifedipine the corresponding values were -2.4% for cholesterol, -5.8% for HDL-cholesterol, +8.0% for triglycerides and +3.2% for ratio. None of these changes was statistically significant. Both lisinopril and nifedipine lowered the blood pressure significantly, 18.1/12.0 mm Hg with lisonopril (p < 0.01 for both systolic and diastolic pressure) and 8.0/8.5 mm Hg with nifedipine (p < 0.01 for both respectively). Both drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, neither lisinopril nor nifedipine had any negative impact on lipid levels.", 
    "526": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) contains two zinc-dependent catalytic domains (N and C domains) each bearing the motif HEXXH where the two histidines form two of the three amino acid zinc ligands. Sequence alignment of each ACE domain with other zinc metalloproteases, indicates a glutamate residues which putatively constitutes the third zinc ligand and an aspartate residue which may form an indirect zinc interaction. We investigated the functional roles of the glutamate and aspartate residues in the ACE C domain (Glu987 and Asp991) using a cDNA encoding an inactive N domain. We mutated Glu987 to aspartate (E987D) or valine (E987V) and Asp991 to glutamate (D991E) or alanine (D991A). Catalytically active mutants (E987D, D991E and D991A) exhibited similar Km values for hippuryl-His-Leu compared to non-mutated C domain. E987D displayed a 300-fold decrease in kcat and a 25-fold reduction in sensitivity to the ACE inhibitor trandolaprilat, whose binding is zinc-dependent. E987V was catalytically inactive and did not bind [3H]trandolaprilat. D991E and D991A exhibited a 3.8- and 22-fold decrease in kcat, respectively, and the Ki' values for trandolaprilat were increased 8- and 29-fold. These results provide strong evidence that Glu987 constitutes the third zinc ligand in the ACE C domain and suggest a role for Asp991 in positioning the C domain active site zinc ion.",

We report here the isolation of a cDNA of murine Gapdh from mouse chromosome 16 (MMU16) originating from microclones of the distal part of MMU16 and the use of homologous genomic DNA sequences to further screen a cDNA phage library. The cDNA was sequenced, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) and the open reading frame was expressed in vitro.

Incubation of the culture with interleukin-1 beta (10 ng/ml) for 24 h caused a significant increase in nitrite levels. The basal and interleukin-1 beta-induced nitrite production by vascular smooth muscle cells were not affected by the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (0.1 approximately 10 microM), enalaprilat, cilazaprilat or captopril. Unstimulated vascular smooth muscle cells expressed no inducible NO synthase transcripts, whereas incubation with interleukin-1 beta for 24 h induced marked inducible NO synthase mRNA expression.

In spontaneously hypertensive rats, single intravenous or oral doses of SR 47436 induced mild to modest antihypertensive effects. No tolerance of the antihypertensive effect was observed when the oral treatment was extended to 15 days. SR 47436 was highly effective to lower blood pressure in high renin-dependent hypertensive models such as two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats and renal artery-ligated hypertensive rats. In this last model, intravenous or oral administration of the angiotensin II antagonist produced a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure. When injected after the maximal effective dose, enalapril did not induce any further decrease in blood pressure. Furthermore, the antihypertensive effect elicited after a single oral dose (10 mg/kg) was long-lasting (at least 24 h). The simultaneous blunting effect of the angiotensin II-induced blood pressure increase indicated clearly that the antihypertensive effect was due to the blockade of vascular angiotensin AT1 receptors. As expected, the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist did not show any efficacy in deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertensive rats, with a suppressed renin-angiotensin system. In genetic and renal hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive effect induced after acute dosing of SR 47436 was similar to that observed after losartan and enalapril. A reflex tachycardia accompanied the antihypertensive effect only after intravenous treatment with either SR 47436 or losartan.

In addition, since GH mice do not have systemic hypertension or an elevated glomerular filtration rate, we could address the question of whether ACEi or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AII RA) had an effect on the development of glomerulosclerosis under these conditions. Since excess matrix accumulates in glomerulosclerosis because of alterations in the balance between its synthesis and degradation, we examined the effect of ACEi and AII RA on these parameters.",

No changes were noted in beta actin, or 72 kD metalloproteinase mRNAs. The result of these changes was a net increase in sclerosis.

    "551": "Simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) results in short-latency thirst and sodium appetite (i.e., the rapid ingestion of water and NaCl solution). To elucidate potential mechanisms for mediating this behavior, changes in plasma levels of key hormones involved in fluid intake and balance were characterized in rats subjected to this treatment protocol. Rats treated jointly with furosemide and low-dose captopril had exaggerated increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin I but equivalent increases in plasma aldosterone compared with rats treated with either agent alone. Treatment with furosemide plus low-dose captopril increased plasma vasopressin but not plasma oxytocin. The administration of a higher dose of captopril (100 mg/kg) with furosemide, a combination of drugs that does not stimulate fluid intake (29), further increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I but prevented the rise in plasma vasopressin. The results support the hypothesis that thirst and salt appetite generated by this protocol depend on angiotensin II formed within brain circumventricular organs rather than the systemic circulation.", 
    "552": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of chronic treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on left ventricular function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Cilazapril (5 mg/kg) was administered in the drinking water continuously for 11 wk, beginning at 4 wk of age. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) was monitored weekly. At the end of the 11-wk period, left ventricular function was quantified using the perfused working heart preparation. Cilazapril exerted a rapid, complete, and persistent antihypertensive effect in the SHR in vivo but had no effect on SAP in the normotensive Sprague-Dawley (S-D) group. Nevertheless, the drug reduced left ventricular weight to the same extent in both strains. Function of untreated SHR hearts was not different from that of the untreated S-D hearts. Cilazapril treatment depressed heart performance (28-35%) in SHR but had no effect in the S-D group. The decline in pump performance in SHR hearts was associated with diminished tension development and velocity of shortening of papillary muscles. These results demonstrate that an ACE inhibitor, administered to young SHR, produces a reduction in left ventricular contractile function, which may be due to a decline in muscle contractility and which cannot be explained exclusively by the reduction in left ventricular mass.", 
    "553": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is known to be present at the surface of endothelial cells and also in the adventitia in large vessels. The presence of ACE in the vascular smooth muscle remains controversial. We microdissected segments of adventitia and media with or without endothelium from a region devoid of collateral arteries. The membrane-bound ACE activity in the media averaged 41% (pmol [glycine-1-14C]hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine hydrolyzed.g tissue-1.min-1) of the values found in the whole aorta, whereas the adventitia contained only 6%. Immunoreactive ACE in media was characterized by Western blotting. ACE mRNAs were detected and characterized after polymerase chain amplification in isolated media. Angiotensin I and angiotensin II were equally able to contract medial rings, and the response to angiotensin I was blocked by enalaprilat. In aortas of two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats, there was an increase in ACE mRNA estimated by ribonuclease protection assay (P = 0.02) and in ACE activity at 15 days and 1 and 3 mo after clipping. This corresponded to a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the ACE activity of both the media and the adventitia compared with sham-operated rats (P < or = 0.02). Thus ACE gene expression occurs in smooth muscle of rat aorta, which contains roughly the same amount of enzyme as the endothelium and readily converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. ACE in the medial layer and the adventitia is upregulated in renovascular hypertension.",

Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA) values remained low before and during enalapril therapy. Transient treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfate after enalapril withdrawal improved the hyperkalemia and renal function, but PRA and PA levels were low.

However, a relation between tissue ACE inhibition and long-term efficacy (ie, concerning left ventricular [LV] hypertrophy and survival) has not been established. The present study was designed to evaluate the impact of low-dose ACE inhibition (predominant inhibition of plasma ACE) and high-dose ACE inhibition associated with substantial tissue ACE inhibition) on reversal of LV hypertrophy and 1-year mortality after myocardial infarction in the rat.",

    "563": "Distensibility and compliance are large artery properties that may be important in cardiovascular disease. Distensibility is a determinant of the pulsatile stress on the vessel wall and is thought to be important in atherosclerotic disease. Compliance reflects the buffering capacity of the arteries and is a major determinant of afterload on the heart. In hypertension, large arteries become stiffer, resulting in decreased distensibility and compliance. Decrease in blood pressure can improve large artery properties, but not all antihypertensive drugs improve large artery properties. Compliance is improved by antihypertensive drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers with vasodilating properties, selective beta 1-blockers and some diuretics. Recent data suggest that ACE inhibitors like perindopril improve distensibility and compliance of large arteries more than diuretics such as amiloride hydrochlorothiazide do. This makes, apart from the indirect effect--the decrease in blood pressure--a direct effect of perindopril on large artery properties very likely. ACE inhibitors like perindopril decrease the afterload on the heart more than diuretics (such as amiloride hydrochlorothiazide) by both a more pronounced decrease in systemic vascular resistance and increase in large artery compliance.",

Before treatment and at the end of a nine-month period of normotension (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg), 24 h blood pressure and echocardiographic measurements were performed and resistance artery structure was determined. Twenty age- and sex-matched normotensives were used as controls. During antihypertensive treatment, mean blood pressure was reduced from 128 +/- 11 to 103 +/- 6 mmHg.

Perindopril is a pro-drug that is hydrolyzed to the active metabolite perindoprilat. Perindopril is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations about 1 h after a single oral dose. Its bioavailability is greater than 70% and is not influenced by meals. Perindoprilat reaches peak plasma concentrations 3 to 4 h after administration. The blood pressure lowering effect of perindopril has been shown in animal models with spontaneous and renovascular hypertension. In hypertensive patients dose response studies have shown a significant and linear relationship between the dose and the activity of perindopril. The antihypertensive efficacy of 4 and 8 mg doses is significantly greater than that of 2 mg or of placebo. The maximal response is attained about 4 to 6 h after the first dose. As demonstrated by 24 h blood pressure recordings in ambulatory patients, the antihypertensive activity of perindopril was still significant 24 h after the last dose. Clinical trials have indicated that perindopril is at least as effective as usual therapeutic doses of captopril, atenolol or a combination of hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride in mild to moderate essential hypertension. Oral administration of 4 to 8 mg od significantly reduced supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and adequate diastolic blood pressure control was attained in about 60 to 70% of patients with monotherapy.

    "571": "The main target organ in untreated arterial hypertension (HTA) is the blood vessel wall (BVW) of the high pressure system (conductance and resistance arteries), which is primarily responsible for vital organ integrity. Three major structural changes develop in the BVW in experimental and human HTA: hypertrophy of the smooth muscle (increased thickness of the media), reduction in the amount of elastin and increased interstitial collagen deposition. The latter two structural changes are responsible for the increased stiffness (reduced compliance) that characterizes the BVW in untreated HTA. Angiotensin II, endothelins, nitric oxide, local growth factors (fibroblast-derived growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta) and metalloproteinases are involved in BVW remodelling, and represent potential targets for drug action. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are particularly suited for such actions via their angiotensin II-, bradykinin- and/or interstitial metalloproteinases-dependent actions. Unfortunately, limited data are available on BVW protection with conventional ACE inhibitors. The new ACE inhibitor perindopril differs from most others in terms of BVW protection. In carefully designed morphometric experiments, perindopril has been shown to reduce vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and to normalize the elastin:collagen ratio in the BVW of hypertensive rats. It has been shown that perindopril is unique in that respect since isradipine, metoprolol, hydralazine and captopril all failed to normalize the media:lumen ratio in the hypertensive rat.

The TPR represents the net fall in blood pressure just before the next dose of medication is taken divided by the maximum reduction in blood pressure. For dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, the TPR is highly dependent upon the pharmacokinetics of the individual compound since the antihypertensive response correlates with the log drug plasma concentration. Accordingly, longer acting formulations exhibit a TPR close to unity with the maximum fall in blood pressure similar to the reduction at the end of the dosing interval. The application of TPR to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has unmasked a number of methodological problems associated with this approach to evaluating a drug's antihypertensive profile. The TPR has been calculated with and without subtracting responses to placebo with first doses and after several weeks of chronic therapy, and in responders only versus all subjects. Different approaches have also been taken to calculate the TPR, leading to marked variations in values. A review of the existing literature leads to the conclusion that improvements in the standardization of study design and data analysis are needed before TPR can become an accepted measure of 24 h blood pressure control.",

Perindopril is a third generation converting enzyme inhibitor that produces profound and prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (24 h after a single dose). Despite a more sustained ACE inhibition than captopril and enalapril, perindopril is devoid of the first dose hypotensive effects noted with these other drugs.
