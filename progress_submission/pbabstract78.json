    "0": "The effects of ACE inhibition with perindopril on the atherosclerosis-induced impairment of arterial flow were investigated via histopathologic studies, hemodynamics, and vascular rheology of hindlimb arteries in 7 adult Pitman-Moore mini-pigs (7 months of age) fed for 4 months with an atherogenic diet and perindopril (at the daily oral dose of 4 mg, which induced a continuous 70% inhibition of serum ACE activity), versus 7 atherogenic and 7 control animals. Major fibroproliferative fatty lesions with medial intimalization were observed in the abdominal aorta. Atherosclerosis impaired the function of both capacitance and resistance hindlimb arteries. In atherogenic mini-pigs, blood pressure (BP) increased significantly due to increased hindlimb peripheral resistance (HPR) and aortic input impedance, although aortic blood flow was not affected. Altered aortic wall rheology revealed that the stiffness of the aorta was markedly increased due to increased wall tension and reduced viscoelasticity, the viscous component being reduced in the arterial wall. Perindopril significantly opposed these alterations by reducing BP, HPR and input impedance and by returning parietal stiffness to control values by increasing aortic compliance. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition significantly prevented the development of atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta by decreasing the cross-sectional area of lesions and the presence of lipid-laden cells, as well as by preventing alteration and fragmentation of elastic laminae. In conclusion, ACE inhibition with perindopril showed a significant preventive action on atherosclerosis-induced deleterious effects on vascular wall function and structure in mini-pig arteries.", 
    "1": "The aim was to determine whether cardiovascular hypertrophy in primary hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is induced by increased levels of angiotensin II or by increased blood pressure. SHR were treated from 7 to 15 weeks of age with perindopril to block the in vivo production of A II and concomitantly infused with either a pressor dose of norepinephrine or angiotensin II. At the end of the treatment period, there was no significant difference in the systolic blood pressure in the norepinephrine or angiotensin II-treated groups (201 +/- 9 and 208 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively). However, there was a significant increase (p < 0.01) in left ventricle-plus-septum/body weight ratio in angiotensin II compared with norepinephrine-infused SHR (3.72 +/- 0.25 and 2.34 +/- 0.04 mg/g, respectively) and in aortic medial cross-sectional area (0.55 +/- 0.05 and 0.38 +/- 0.01 mm2, respectively). Using an unbiased optical dissector/fractionator technique, the number of smooth muscle cells in the descending thoracic aorta of the angiotensin II-infused SHR was not different from norepinephrine-infused rats (5.02 +/- 0.30 x 10(6) and 4.71 +/- 0.42 x 10(6) cells, respectively), and no difference in size of enzyme-isolated cells was observed (mode: 1,326 +/- 127 microns 3 compared with 1,186 +/- 82 microns 3). The results indicate that angiotensin II directly stimulates cardiac and aortic hypertrophy through a mechanism unrelated to its effect on blood pressure. The aortic hypertrophy is not due to an increase in smooth muscle cell size or number and thus must be related to an increase in the extracellular compartment.", 
    "2": "In 15 type I diabetics with manifest diabetic nephropathy the authors investigated the antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effect of captopril and in seven patients of this group also its effect on renal haemodynamics. Captopril treatment or its combination with hitherto used antihypertensive treatment was associated after two months with a significant drop of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure from 150/95 (120/70-195/110) to 130/90 (110/65-180/115) mmHg, (p < 0.005 < 0.05). The median aortic pressure declined from 118.5 (92-140.8) to 106.5 (84-1334.8) mm Hg (p < 0.005). Nine of 11 patients (82%) could be changed to reduced antihypertensive therapy. The antiproteinuric effect was manifested in 11 patients (73%). Quantitative proteinuria dropped from 2.7 (0.83-8.65) to 1.85 (0.38-8.84) g/24 h., (p < 0.05) without a significant change of serum creatinine: 109 (70-342) vs. 135 (90-288) mumol/l, p = n.s.). The change of proteinuria, as compared with the baseline value, was -41 (-77 - +88)%, (p < 0.05) and did not correlate with the change of the median aortic pressure (correlation coefficient = -0.165, p = n.s.). In the group of seven patients the change of the median aortic pressure was -15% (-26.1 - +6.6), (p < 0.05). No statistically significant change of glomerular filtration was observed: 0.96 (0.32-1.38) vs. 0.96 (0.19-1.71) ml/s, p = n.s.); effective renal plasma flow: 6.32 (2.24-7.74) vs. 7.22 (1.68-10.55) ml/s, (p = n.s.); filtration fraction: 0.136 (0.123-0.220) vs. 0.130 (0.110-0.236), change 0.0 (-43.0 - +31.0)% (p = n.s.) and renal vascular resistance: 15429 (12907-54148) vs. 13243 (7099-77832)%, (p. = n.s.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "A reaction between enzyme renin and its only natural substrate angiotensinogen is the initial and rate-limiting step for producing a potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II as the final product of the renin-angiotensin system, a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In order to assess the role of the interaction of human renin with human angiotensinogen in the development of high blood pressure, we have constructed the chimeric renin-angiotensin cascade in mice comprising both human renin and human angiotensinogen as well as the endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor by cross-mating separate lines of transgenic mice carrying either the human renin or human angiotensinogen genes. Although each single gene carrier did not develop hypertension despite the observed normal tissue-specific expression of the transgenes, dual gene strains exhibited a chronically sustained increase in blood pressure. Administration of a human renin-specific inhibitor (ES-8891) was effective in reducing the elevated blood pressure only against the cross-mated hybrid mice, but treatment of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) and a selective antagonist (DuP 753) directed at the angiotensin II receptor decreased the basal level of blood pressure even in single gene carriers as well as in dual gene mice. These results clearly demonstrated that the sustained increase in blood pressure of the hybrid mice was initiated by the interaction between the products of the two human genes.", 
    "4": "Infusion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) into rats increased adrenal mitochondrial synthesis of aldosterone from deoxycorticosterone and the adrenal cytosolic content of aldosterone. The dose-response relationships for these last two effects of ET-1 were found to be biphasic with a maximum (corresponding to 80 to 200% increase) at 50 to 80 ng ET-1/kg/min, and were also dependent on the infusion rate. Plasma aldosterone levels were also increased in a similar ratio. Previous infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril did not affect the ET-1-induced increase in steroidogenesis. Finally, pregnenolene production was also increased in incubations of mitochondria from treated rats. These results indicate that ET-1 augments aldosteronogenesis by increasing the early as well as the late pathway. These effects were independent of the formation of angiotensin II. Isolated glomerulosa cells responded to ET-1 increasing aldosterone production in a dose-related fashion. These results confirm a direct effect of ET-1 on the adrenal gland in vivo.", 
    "5": "A reduction in functioning renal mass through surgical ablation leads to the development of hypertension and chronic renal failure in rats. Reduced renal mass (RRM) hypertension is more severe and develops more quickly if rats are on high salt intake. It has previously been shown that hypertension in these rats can be prevented by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The current experiment examined the effect of losartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, on blood pressure in RRM and intact rats after a 3-fold increase in salt intake. It was found that chronic treatment with i.v. losartan (3 mg/kg/day) completely prevented sodium-induced hypertension in the RRM rats, whereas neither increased salt intake nor losartan treatment affected blood pressure in the intact rats. The antihypertensive effect of losartan was associated with an apparent renoprotective effect in RRM rats (blood urea nitrogen concentration rose in untreated animals, but remained stable in treated animals), but was not accompanied by chronic changes in water or sodium balance. The ability of losartan to prevent RRM hypertension suggests that angiotensin II is necessary for the development of this model of hypertension.", 
    "6": "Previous studies in adult animals have indicated that plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity is inhibited by endotoxin. Reduced ACE activity may decrease plasma angiotensin II (AII) levels, contributing to the refractory hypotension we have previously reported in neonatal septic shock. In this study, hemodynamic function, plasma renin activity (PRA), AII, prostacyclin (PGI2), and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) levels were measured in 17-20-day-old dogs before and 1, 2, and 3 hr after endotoxin administration (1 mg/kg, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide-B). PRA and AII levels rose significantly 60 min post-endotoxin, returning to baseline values by 180 min; PGI2 and thromboxane B2 levels rose post-endotoxin and remained elevated. Indomethacin or captopril was given by oral gavage 30-35 min before endotoxin. Captopril significantly blunted the rise in PRA and AII, while indomethacin blocked the rise in PGI2 and TxB2. Mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output fell 60 min after endotoxin challenge without pharmacologic intervention and remained depressed. Our data suggest that renin and AII responses to endotoxin challenge remain intact in the neonatal subject. Maintenance of hemodynamics in indomethacin-pretreated dogs may be due to unopposed stimulation of the peripheral vasculature by AII. Thromboxane B2 in maintenance of vasomotor tone may be minimal in the young.", 
    "7": "Potent vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and vasopressin have been implicated as mediators of persistent vasoconstriction after reversible superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. Neither captopril (CAP), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, nor papaverine (PAP), a vasodilator, has proven effective in reversing this vasoconstriction when employed singly. The present study examined the combined effect of these agents in reducing mortality in a murine model of acute mesenteric ischemia. The SMAs of 106 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were totally occluded for 85 minutes. Test agents were given intravenously at reperfusion over a 90-minute period. Survival rates were assessed at 48 hours. CAP was given as a single bolus (0.3 mg/kg) and PAP (0.5 mg/kg/h) as an infusion. Aortic and SMA blood flows were measured pretreatment and posttreatment in a separate group of 19 animals treated with CAP and PAP as single agents. chi 2 analysis and analysis of variance were used to test differences with p < or = 0.05 accepted as significant. PAP alone as an adjunct resulted in a significant increase in 48-hour survival (57% versus 19%, p < or = 0.005). PAP in combination with CAP produced the best outcome in this model (87% versus 19%, p < or = 0.005). Aortic blood flow decreased, whereas SMA blood flow increased after treatment both with CAP and with PAP, but not significantly. The combination of an intravenously administered vasodilator with either glucagon or an ACE inhibitor was the most effective adjunctive therapy in this mesenteric ischemia model. There was no evidence that an inotropic effect, rather than SMA vasodilation, was the responsible mechanism of action.", 
    "8": "The pathophysiological role of angiotensin II in the development of renal sclerosis was investigated in 5/6-nephrectomized, 12-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats. After 1 week of a control period, nephrectomized rats received one of the following treatments for 4 weeks: the selective nonpeptide angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist TCV-116 (1 mg/kg per day), the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor delapril (30 mg/kg per day), hydralazine (15 mg/kg per day), or vehicle. Urinary protein and albumin excretions and systolic blood pressure were determined every week. Rats with reduced renal mass treated with vehicle had a poor survival rate (30%). Although TCV-116, delapril, and hydralazine treatment significantly improved the survival rate for 4 weeks, hydralazine failed to improve proteinuria and albuminuria as well as the decline in renal function compared with delapril or TCV-116. Histological examination revealed that both TCV-116 and delapril protected glomeruli from sclerosis, whereas hydralazine did not improve histological findings (5%, 7%, and 30% of glomeruli were affected, respectively). These results indicate that angiotensin II plays a dominant role through its type 1 receptor in the pathogenesis of renal deterioration by hypertension.", 
    "9": "Infusion of bradykinin into the renal medullary interstitium (0.1 micrograms/min, n = 6) significantly increased renal papillary blood flow as measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry to 117 +/- 3% of control without altering cortical blood flow or blood pressure in anesthetized Munich-Wistar rats. In animals prepared for clearance studies, renal medullary bradykinin infusion did not alter total renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, or renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure but increased urine flow by 100%, sodium excretion by 111%, and fractional sodium excretion by 107%. No changes occurred in mean arterial pressure or contralateral kidney function during the interstitial bradykinin infusion. Blockade of endogenous kinin degradation by interstitial infusion of captopril (1 mg/hr) significantly increased papillary blood flow by 21 +/- 5% without altering cortical blood flow. Pretreatment with the nitric oxide inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (2 micrograms/min, n = 7) eliminated the increase in papillary blood flow associated with either bradykinin or captopril infusion. We conclude that renal medullary interstitial infusion of bradykinin increases sodium and water excretion, which is associated with a selective increase in papillary blood flow by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism.", 
    "10": "The cleavage of synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate has been used to infer the presence of renin in the walls of isolated blood vessels; however, the conversion of natural angiotensinogen to angiotensin in isolated blood vessels has not been reported. We studied the release of angiotensinogen and the formation of angiotensins in a bloodless, perfused, isolated hind limb preparation of the rat. Perfusion with a modified Tyrode's solution resulted in spontaneous release of 4.7 +/- 1.5 pmol per 30 minutes of angiotensinogen as measured directly by radioimmunoassay. Western blot further identified the released material as angiotensinogen. Spontaneous release of angiotensins I and II was demonstrated by high performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. When highly purified rat angiotensinogen was added to the perfusate, release of angiotensin II was increased 14-fold compared with saline infusion. Captopril (10 mumol/L) inhibited angiotensinogen-induced angiotensin II release by 67% and led to an increase in angiotensin I release by 301%. Bilateral nephrectomy 24 hours before the experiments reduced basal angiotensin release below the detection limit and blunted angiotensinogen-induced angiotensin II formation by 95%. We conclude that active renin is present in the vessel wall and interacts with its natural substrate to form angiotensin peptides. Our data support the notion that the bulk of vascular renin is taken up from the circulation.",

    "12": "In four normotensive subjects and six hypertensive patients, we investigated whether infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II) affected circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Overall, mean levels of PAI-1 antigen increased significantly from 20.1 ng/mL before Ang II infusion to 36.0 ng/mL at the end of Ang II infusion (p = 0.008), whereas no change in PAI-1 was observed for control subjects infused with 5% dextrose (p = 0.46). Among the normotensive subjects for whom graded doses of Ang II were infused at 0, 1, 3, and 10 ng.kg-1.min-1, mean PAI-1 levels increased sequentially from 14.7 ng/mL to 23.0, 26.8, and 33.5 ng/mL, a dose-response relation that, compared with controls, was highly significant (p < 0.001). Among the hypertensive patients for whom a single 45-minute infusion of Ang II was given at a dose of 3 ng.kg-1.min-1, PAI-1 levels increased from 23.7 to 37.7 ng/mL, whereas PAI-1 levels among control subjects infused with 5% dextrose decreased from 16.9 to 10.8 ng/mL (p = 0.04). Finally, when compared with infusion of 5% dextrose solution, infusion of Ang II appeared to have little effect on circulating levels of t-PA antigen.", 
    "13": "These in vivo data suggest that infusion of Ang II results in a rapid increase in circulating levels of PAI-1, a finding that may help to explain clinical observations linking the renin-angiotensin system and thrombotic risk.", 
    "14": "Roughly 40% of all diabetic patients, whether insulin dependent or not, develop persistent albuminuria (over 300 mg/24 hr), a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, and elevated blood pressure, ie, diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is the single most important cause of end stage renal disease in the Western world, and accounts for over a quarter of all end stage renal disease. It also is a major cause of the increased morbidity and mortality seen in diabetic patients; for example, the cost of end stage renal care in the United States currently exceeds +1.8 billion per year for diabetic nephropathy alone and is rapidly rising. Increased arterial blood pressure is an early and common finding in incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy. Fluid and sodium retention with normal concentrations of active renin, angiotensin I and II, and aldosterone has been demonstrated in diabetic renal disease. An impaired nocturnal decline in blood pressure is more prevalent in patients with diabetic nephropathy and autonomic neuropathy, and may contribute to the enhanced cardiovascular morbidity found in such patients. Moreover, raised blood pressure accelerates both the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy in insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The relationship between arterial blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy thus seems to be a complex one: nephropathy increasing blood pressure and blood pressure accelerating the course of nephropathy. Effective blood pressure reduction reduces albuminuria, delays the progression of nephropathy, and postpones renal insufficiency in diabetic nephropathy. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors induce an acute increase in the glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and renal sodium excretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "Renal dysplasia and agenesis may be a familial disorder. We report the familial occurrence of unilateral renal agenesis and proteinuria that, at least in one case, was related to focal glomerulosclerosis. Whether these abnormalities are related to an intrinsic abnormality in the remaining kidney, hyperfiltration injury, systemic hypertension, or some other poorly defined factor is unclear at present. However, this report, along with previous case reports of familial renal agenesis, suggests that ultrasonographic screening of first-degree relatives of patients with renal agenesis is appropriate. Whether treatments such as dietary protein restriction, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or other therapeutic interventions will have a beneficial effect in asymptomatic individuals with unilateral renal agenesis remains to be determined.", 
    "16": "Immunologic and hemodynamic factors are likely to work in synergism in the progression of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) toward sclerosis. The local activation of the renin-angiotensin system may be one the most relevant mechanisms. We investigated the hemodynamic effects of the acute administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (captopril 50 mg). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by 51Cr-EDTA and 125I hippurate clearances. The correspondent filtration fractions (FFs) in basal conditions and after administration of ACEI were calculated, then the changes in FF (delta FF and % delta FF) were determined. We studied 27 IgAN patients. Eighteen patients had normal renal function (GFR, 112 +/- 19 mL/min/1.73 m2) and nine had moderate renal impairment (GFR, 54 +/- 13 mL/min/1.73 m2). Sixteen patients had proteinuria > or = 0.5 g/d. In addition, 12 glomerulonephritis control cases and eight healthy subjects were investigated. After the administration of ACEI in healthy subjects we observed slight modifications in the GFR, a significant increase in the ERPF (P < 0.005), and a significant decrease in FF (P < 0.04). Similarly, in IgAN patients with normal renal function the GFR increased slightly, the ERPF increased significantly (P < 0.01), and there was a decrease in FF (P < 0.01). The delta FF and % delta FF values were not significantly different from those found in the controls. In patients with initial renal failure GFR remained unchanged, ERPF increased significantly (P < 0.005), and FF significantly decreased (P < 0.004). However, the changes in delta FF and % delta FF were significantly greater than those found in healthy controls (P < 0.01) and in IgAN patients with normal renal function (P < 0.001). IgAN patients with proteinuria levels > or = 0.5 g/d showed greater changes in delta FF and % delta FF after the administration of ACEI than patients with proteinuria levels lower than 0.5 g/d (P < 0.003 and P < 0.04, respectively) or proteinuric control cases (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). This different response in proteinuric and nonproteinuric patients was evident even when the analysis was limited to the subgroup of IgAN patients with normal renal function. The decrease in FF consequent to an increase in the ERPF after the administration of ACEI suggests a local hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin system in some cases of IgAN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The objective of these experiments was to assess the possibility that the increase in tail skin temperature (TSK) accompanying administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) was mediated by angiotensin II (AngII) as a result of stimulation of renin release by ISO. Although AngII is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor in mammals, acute administration of this peptide to rats induces a vasodilation of blood vessels in the tail and an increase in TSK. The objective was approached in several (DuP 753); ways: (i) use of the nonpeptide AngII receptor antagonist losartan potassium (DuP 753); (ii) use of the peptide AngII receptor antagonist saralasin; (iii) use of the AngI-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and (iv) chronic administration of AngII. The rationale for these experiments was that blockade of AngII receptors (Experiments 1 and 2), inhibition of the enzyme that converts AngI to AngII (Experiment 3), or down-regulation of the AngII receptors (Experiment 4) would be expected to prevent any contribution to the ISO-induced increase in TSK by AngII. The results of these experiments are consistent in revealing that the response of TSK to ISO administration is due in part (approximately 55%) to a direct effect of ISO and in part (approximately 45%) to an indirect effect resulting from the ISO-stimulated release of renin from the kidneys and the formation of AngII in the blood.", 
    "18": "The effects of long-term treatment with captopril and conventional therapy on albuminuria and metabolic parameters were compared in 74 hypertensive type II diabetics with normal serum creatinine. Patients were treated double-blind with either captopril monotherapy or combined with hydrochlorothiazide or therapy with metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, or both for 36 months. The treatment was titrated to achieve goal diastolic blood pressure of < or = 85 mm Hg. The reductions in blood pressures during treatment were similar in patients with (n = 21) and without (n = 53) microalbuminuria treated with either captopril or conventional therapy. No significant changes in albuminuria occurred in normoalbuminuric patients with either therapy. Although albuminuria fell in nearly all patients with microalbuminuria treated with captopril, it rose in eight of 12 patients on conventional therapy, with macroalbuminuria developing in two of them. Renal function was preserved by both types of treatment in both patient groups. Long-term treatment with either conventional therapy or captopril did not alter metabolic variables. We conclude that captopril alone or in combination decreases albuminuria and prevents the development of macroalbuminuria in hypertensive type II diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria. The renoprotective effect of this agent, however, remains to be demonstrated with longer term data on renal function. Aggressive antihypertensive treatment with either captopril or conventional therapy appears to be effective in preventing the onset of microalbuminuria in most normoalbuminuric patients. In contrast, with previous short-term studies, the use of converting enzyme inhibitors or conventional therapy did not cause adverse metabolic effects.",

In V-HeFT I, 642 men with heart failure were followed an average of 2.28 years, providing 1,464 patient-years of follow-up. In V-HeFT II, 804 men were followed an average of 2.56 years, with 2,061 patient-years of follow-up.

The incidence of all thromboembolic events during 1,068 patient-years without warfarin in V-HeFT I was 2.7/100 patient-years and during 1,188 patient-years in V-HeFT II was 2.1/100 patient-years and was not reduced in patients treated with warfarin. Patients experiencing events had a lower peak exercise oxygen consumption (p < 0.03 in V-HeFT I and p < 0.001 in V-HeFT II) and a lower mean ejection fraction (p = 0.10 in V-HeFT I and p = 0.07 in V-HeFT II).

Hospitalizations were not recorded if a patient died during transit to the hospital or in the hospital emergency department before admission. In Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT) I, no significant difference in number of patients hospitalized or number of hospitalizations was noted among the treatment groups, although there was a trend for fewer and delayed cardiac hospitalizations in the hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate arm in which the survival was greater. In V-HeFT II, no difference in hospitalizations was apparent between the enalapril and hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate arms. Univariate predictors of hospitalization for all causes were reduced peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during exercise (p < 0.0001), reduced exercise duration (p < 0.0001), increased cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiograph (p < 0.0001), increased age (p < 0.03), and use of antiarrhythmic drugs (p < 0.013), whereas multivariate predictors were reduced peak VO2 (p < 0.0001), use of antiarrhythmic drugs (p < 0.015), and increased cardiothoracic ratio (p < 0.03).

Baseline measurements of left ventricular internal diameters (LVIDd, LVIDs), wall thickness (THd, THs), radius to thickness ratios (Rd/THd, Rs/THs), and mitral E-point septal separation (EPSS) were evaluated as predictors of mortality individually, in multivariate regression models with each other, and with nonechocardiographic predictors. Within-subject changes were compared between treatment groups. Cumulative survival curves were compared between strata formed by cut-points of EPSS and Rs/THs data. In Cox regression analyses, EPSS, LVIDs, and Rs/THs were significant predictors of mortality. In V-HeFT I, Rd/THd was a predictor in the presence of ejection fraction and peak oxygen uptake. In patients with EPSS > or = 21, there was an 83% increase in mortality in the subgroup of patients with Rs/THs > or = 2.5 compared with Rs/THs < 2.5 (p = 0.003), whereas there was no statistical difference for EPSS < 21. EPSS showed improvement in patients treated with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate compared with placebo at 2 and 18 months and a trend toward deterioration between 36 and 66 months.

    "32": "Patients were randomized (double-blind) to 20 mg of prazosin daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg daily of isosorbide dinitrate or placebo. We compared enalapril (20 mg daily), a converting enzyme inhibitor, with Hyd-Iso in 804 men over another 5-year period in V-HeFT II: Background therapy in both trials consisted of digitalis and diuretics. Serial bicycle ergometric exercise was performed with gas exchange measurements during progressive incremental work rates to a symptom-limited peak end point. Gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge) measurement was performed in the second trial. In V-HeFT I, an increase in peak VO2 with Hyd-Iso compared with placebo approached significance at 2 months (p < 0.16) and was significant (p < 0.04) at 1 year. In V-HeFT II, Hyd-Iso significantly increased peak VO2 compared with enalapril (p < 0.01 at 3 months, p < 0.02 at 6 months and 2 years). The changes in ATge measurements were not statistically different between the two treatment groups in V-HeFT II:", 
    "33": "Combination therapy with Hyd-Iso was more effective in increasing peak VO2 than placebo, prazosin, or enalapril in patients with mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure. Long-term data were confounded by mortality and other events, which may have led to an underestimate of the benefits of Hyd-Iso over placebo and an underestimate of the long-term benefits of enalapril on exercise performance. Therefore, short-term improvement in exercise performance is a suitable therapeutic end point, but long-term studies should more appropriately assess mortality.",

Measurements included in this analysis were left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) measured by radionuclide angiography, peak bicycle exercise oxygen consumption (VO2), cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) measured on a chest x-ray, ventricular arrhythmias assessed in a core laboratory by short-term Holter monitoring, plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity measured in a core laboratory only in V-HeFT II, and a variety of diagnostic and demographic data. The variables related only weakly to each other. EF, VO2, and CTR were powerful independent predictors of all-cause mortality in both studies. Ventricular arrhythmia was a significant independent predictor in V-HeFT II but not in V-HeFT I. Plasma norepinephrine but not plasma renin activity measured in V-HeFT II also had independent prognostic value. Other variables did not exert an independent effect on mortality.",

Short-term (4-hour to 8-hour) Holter tape recordings were performed before randomization, at 3 months, at 1 year, and yearly thereafter. Of 804 patients randomized to therapy, 715 had Holters at baseline. Couplets were noted in 56% versus 60% and ventricular tachycardia (VT) (three or more consecutive ventricular premature beats) in 27% versus 29% of patients randomized to enalapril versus hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, respectively. The presence of VT at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years predicted significantly higher mortality during the subsequent year (p < 0.0001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.037, respectively). In the enalapril group, VT prevalence decreased by 27% at 1 year (p < 0.02). A decrease in prevalence of VT was not seen in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group. New VT was seen in 11% of enalapril patients versus 24% of hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate patients at 1 year (p < 0.002). When compared with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate at 1 and 2 years, there was a 52% and 49% reduction, respectively, in sudden deaths in the enalapril group. Thus, at 1 and 2 years, the decrease in sudden deaths in the enalapril group coincided with the decrease in VT prevalence and the decrease in new VT emergence.", 
    "39": "In patients with heart failure, VT and couplets predict increased mortality. When compared with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, enalapril decreases both the persistence of baseline VT at 3 months and the emergence of new VT at 1 and 2 years. The reduction in VT prevalence parallels a reduction in sudden death. The effect of enalapril on survival over hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate may be related to its ability to reduce prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia.", 
    "40": "Congestive heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by neuroendocrine activation. Measurements of plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity were performed in the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial II (V-HeFT II) to characterize the effect of therapy on neuroendocrine activation and to examine the responses to therapy among patients with different degrees of activation.", 
    "41": "The baseline median plasma norepinephrine value (n = 743) was 490 pg/mL and the baseline median plasma renin activity (n = 737) was 6.9 ng.mL-1 x hr-1. Baseline plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine correlated poorly with each other (r = 0.12), implying that these two neuroendocrine systems are being activated by separate processes. By univariate analysis, the logarithms of the plasma norepinephrine (p < 0.0001) and the plasma renin activity (p = 0.01) were significantly related to all-cause mortality. In a multivariate analysis that included other significant univariate prognostic variables (i.e., baseline ejection fraction, peak oxygen consumption during exercise, and cardiothoracic ratio), log plasma norepinephrine but not plasma renin activity remained a significant (p = 0.02) predictor of mortality. Baseline plasma norepinephrine correlated poorly with baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.18), peak oxygen consumption (r = -0.15), and cardiothoracic ratio (r = 0.11). Neither the plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.09) nor the plasma renin activity (r = 0.18) was closely associated with a quality of life assessment at baseline. The baseline plasma norepinephrine level in patients randomized to enalapril (mean, 593 +/- 388 [SD] pg/mL; n = 372) and to hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (mean, 544 +/- 297 pg/mL; n = 371) were similar. Thirteen weeks after randomization, plasma norepinephrine did not change (-5 +/- 393 pg/mL) in 312 patients randomized to enalapril but increased significantly by 74 +/- 311 pg/mL (p < 0.0001) in 300 patients assigned to hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate. The plasma norepinephrine increased significantly more in patients assigned to hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate than those on enalapril at both 13 weeks (p = 0.01) and at 1 year (p = 0.04) (90 +/- 302 pg/mL [n = 240] versus 14 +/- 376 pg/mL [n = 265]). Based on previous reports and examination of survival among several plasma norepinephrine strata, the baseline plasma norepinephrine data were grouped into three relatively homogeneous strata for further analysis. The cumulative mortality was significantly different between the three strata (p < 0.0001). The patients with plasma norepinephrine > 900 pg/mL had a higher mortality than those with corresponding values from 601 to 900 pg/mL or < 600 pg/mL. The survival benefit of enalapril compared with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate was most evident in those patients with a plasma norepinephrine value > 900 pg/mL. Although the plasma renin activity was not strongly associated with survival, patients in the upper quartile (> 16 ng.mL-1 x hr-1) had the worst prognosis. Among this group, the patients on enalapril demonstrated significantly better survival than those on hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (p = 0.02).", 
    "42": "This study confirms that plasma norepinephrine is an independent predictor of prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure. Hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment, unlike enalapril treatment, was associated with increased plasma norepinephrine concentration during the first year of follow-up. The enalapril group had a significantly lower mortality, and this survival benefit of enalapril as compared with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate was most evident among patients with the most marked neuroendocrine activation. Neuroendocrine activation is an important prognostic factor for patients with congestive heart failure and is an important determinant of the differential response to vasodilators.",

    "44": "Patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of enalapril or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily. At 2 years, treatment with enalapril resulted in a significant (28%) reduction in mortality relative to the active control treatment. Baseline variables were examined to determine their impact on risk of mortality and on relative response to treatment. Mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with severe ventricular arrhythmias; in patients with low baseline ejection fractions, low peak oxygen consumption, and low systolic blood pressures; in patients with high cardiothoracic ratios, high scores indicating greater impairment on a quality-of-life questionnaire, and high plasma norepinephrine or renin levels; and in patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes III and IV. Coronary artery disease, duration of CHF, and patient age were not predictive of mortality. Enalapril reduced mortality significantly compared with hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate in patient subgroups with high plasma renin or norepinephrine levels and in patients with low cardiothoracic ratios. Furthermore, enalapril conferred significantly greater protection from mortality than hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate in patients in NYHA classes I and II and in patients without arrhythmias or with < or = 10 premature ventricular contractions per hour.", 
    "45": "Of the prerandomization characteristics that were predictive of mortality in patients with CHF, only neurohormone measurements, cardiothoracic ratios, arrhythmia severity, and NYHA class identified subgroups of patients who benefited most from treatment with enalapril; a treatment interaction across strata was detected only for plasma norepinephrine and NYHA class. In no patient subgroup was the mortality with enalapril treatment significantly higher than the mortality with hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate treatment.",

In V-HeFT I, 283 of 642 patients (44%) died during follow-up (average, 2.3 years), and in V-HeFT II, 285 of 804 randomized patients (35.5%) died during follow-up (average, 2.5 years). Mechanism of death was established centrally using a standardized classification. In V-HeFT I, 124 of the 283 deaths (43.8%) were sudden with no worsening of symptoms; in V-HeFT II, 104 of the 285 deaths (36.5%) were sudden. An average of 31.5% of the deaths (31.4% and 31.6%, respectively) in the two trials was due to pump failure. The proportion of sudden deaths that occurred without worsening of symptoms was similar in patients with and without ischemic heart failure. Sudden deaths tended to occur earlier and pump failure deaths later in both V-HeFT studies. There was a trend for a lower percentage of cardiac deaths from pump failure and a higher percentage from sudden death in subgroups with higher peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO2), higher ejection fraction, and lower plasma norepinephrine levels. The proportion of deaths that occurred suddenly was similar in placebo, prazosin, and hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate treatment groups but was significantly lower in the enalapril treatment group. In V-HeFT I, measures of cardiac function and VO2 predicted pump failure death and sudden death. In V-HeFT II, VO2 and cardiothoracic ratio were independent predictors of all-cause deaths and pump failure deaths; only ejection fraction was an independent predictor of both pump failure and sudden death.", 
    "48": "Although mechanistically distinct terminal events can be identified in patients with heart failure and physiological measurements can provide some insight into the risk of these disparate events, sudden death and pump failure death both appear largely to be linked to the severity of cardiac dysfunction and symptoms. Strategies to identify individuals for selective preventive therapy are not yet practical.",

The importance, if any, of improvement or worsening in serial LVEF has not been defined.

All patients had heart failure with documented exercise intolerance and abnormal LVEF or cardiac dilatation by chest x-ray or echocardiography. Radionuclide LVEF was obtained at baseline, within 6 months, and at least yearly after randomization to treatment. Cumulative survival subsequent to LVEF follow-up measurements was calculated for strata defined by LVEF change from baseline. In V-HeFT I, patients treated with hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate (H-I) experienced a significant (p < 0.001) increase in LVEF and a survival advantage over those treated with placebo and prazosin. In V-HeFT II, both treatment groups showed significant improvements in LVEF, with the increase with H-I greater than that with enalapril, and enalapril provided a significant survival advantage over H-I. Change (> 5) in LVEF from baseline at 6 months (V-HeFT I) and 1 year (V-HeFT II) were the strongest predictors of mortality among the serial measurements and were significant after adjustment for therapy and baseline LVEF. Baseline clinical variables were not helpful in predicting the patients who would experience an improvement in LVEF.", 
    "51": "In patients with heart failure, serial measurements of LVEF provide additional important prognostic information. Vasodilator therapy with H-I is associated with an improvement in LVEF and prognosis. Vasodilator therapy with enalapril improves LVEF less than H-I but provides an additional survival benefit.",

The distributions of treatments and baseline characteristics from history, physical findings, and laboratory data were analyzed for differences across age categories. Survival curves were calculated for age strata according to treatment, presence or absence of coronary artery disease, ejection fraction, and peak oxygen consumption. Risk ratios for age and treatment categories showed no consistent trend of treatment effect on mortality. Age was significantly associated with coronary artery disease, hypertension, rhythm disturbances, systolic blood pressure, ejection fraction, and peak oxygen uptake, but successive age strata did not show incremental changes. Survival curves did not show progressively steeper slopes with advancing age. In V-HeFT I, the oldest patients did have the poorest survival, but age interacted with the presence of coronary artery disease and randomization into the placebo group.",

V-HeFT I compared treatment with prazosin, hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, and placebo, whereas V-HeFT II compared hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate with enalapril. Follow-up evaluations included serial Holter monitors, serial metabolic exercise testing, hospitalization data, and clinical examinations. In V-HeFT I, cumulative mortality at 2 years was 0.34 for patients with atrial fibrillation and 0.30 for patients in sinus rhythm (p = 0.25). Overall cumulative mortality was 0.54 for atrial fibrillation patients and 0.64 for sinus rhythm patients (p = 0.86). In V-HeFT II, cumulative mortality at 2 years was 0.20 for patients with atrial fibrillation and 0.21 for patients with sinus rhythm (p = 0.68), and overall cumulative mortality was 0.46 for atrial fibrillation patients and 0.52 for those in sinus rhythm (p < 0.46). Sudden death was not increased with atrial fibrillation in V-HeFT I patients (p = 0.64) or in V-HeFT II (p = 0.68). By multivariate analysis, the relative mortality risk for atrial fibrillation was 0.95 in V-HeFT I and 0.76 in V-HeFT II: Metabolic exercise testing, showed no significant difference in mean change in peak oxygen consumption between patients with atrial fibrillation and those with sinus rhythm in V-HeFT I and a slight decrease late in V-HeFT II: Hospitalization rate for heart failure was not increased in either study. The embolic event rate was not increased for atrial fibrillation patients: 3% versus 4.9% of patients in sinus rhythm (p = 0.41) in V-HeFT I and 4.0% versus 6.0% in V-HeFT II patients (p = 0.44). A secondary analysis compared mortality of patients in atrial fibrillation with that of patients in sinus rhythm on all Holters: Mortality was not increased overall (p = 0.72 in V-HeFT I and p = 0.35 in V-HeFT II).",

    "58": "This study was designed to elucidate how central and peripheral arginine vasopressin (AVP) interacts with the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system to maintain blood pressure in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rabbits. We recorded renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in the conscious state as an index of sympathetic nervous system function. The changes in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and RSNA were recorded continuously for 60 minutes after intravenous administrations of captopril (2.5 mg/kg) and nicardipine (3.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) in eight identical rabbits. Despite equivalent reductions in mean arterial pressure (10 +/- 1 mm Hg), the increase in RSNA was significantly larger with captopril than that with nicardipine, and the plasma concentration of AVP was elevated (from 100% to 255 +/- 24%) with captopril. Mean arterial pressure was reduced, and RSNA was increased by intravenous infusion of AVP antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (n = 8), whereas vertebral artery infusion of the antagonist (n = 6) did not change RSNA. During central and peripheral infusions of AVP antagonist, RSNA was exaggerated by blood pressure reduction with nicardipine as well as with captopril. Increases in RSNA induced by captopril and nicardipine were larger by central infusion of AVP antagonist than by intravenous infusion. The decrease in mean arterial pressure by captopril (30 +/- 4 mm Hg) in eight sinoaortic-denervated hypertensive rabbits was larger than that in hypertensive rabbits with intact baroreflex. These data suggest that compensatory activation of RSNA was revealed by central and peripheral attenuation of AVP and that the sympathetic nervous system became the most important mechanism for blood pressure maintenance in the absence of AVP. The interaction of AVP with the sympathetic nervous system may be independent of the state of the renin-angiotensin system, since the exaggeration of RSNA by AVP antagonist was qualitatively the same with nicardipine as with captopril. In conscious renal-hypertensive rabbits, AVP in the central nervous system played a substantial role when blood pressure was reduced, although it did not contribute to blood pressure maintenance in the basal condition.", 
    "59": "The pathophysiology, clinical features, complications, and pharmacologic management of adult idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are reviewed. Loss of plasma proteins in the urine is the primary process leading to the nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The four principal causes, or subclasses, of adult idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are membranous nephropathy (MN), minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN); definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of a renal biopsy specimen. Treatment of nephrotic syndrome may be directed at the specific cause of the proteinuria, the proteinuria itself, or the complications induced by the syndrome. The four subclasses of nephrotic syndrome vary in their response to therapy. Corticosteroids, alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents, and cyclosporine have been used to induce partial or complete remission in patients with MN, MCD, and FSGS; combinations of corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents, platelet inhibitors, and anticoagulants have been used to treat patients with MPGN. Treatment of proteinuria involves dietary protein restriction with the possible addition of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Management of the complications of nephrotic syndrome encompasses the use of diuretics; a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet; lipid-lowering agents; and anticoagulants. Patients with nephrotic syndrome are in a constant state of flux with respect to fluid status, organ function, and critical protein balance. Treatment is based on the histologic subclass of the disease.",

All patients were treated with cilazapril 5 mg/day over a 6-months period and underwent a 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a complete Doppler echocardiographic examination at study entry, after 3 and 6-months of therapy. After therapy, mean systolic and diastolic arterial pressure decreased significantly from 153 +/- 16/102 +/- 8 mmHg to 135 +/- 13/83 +/- 6 mmHg respectively (p < 0.005/0.001 respectively). Moreover there was a significant decrease of left ventricular mass from 109 +/- 27 to 87 +/- 23 g/m2 (p < 0.005). Ejection phase indices did not change significantly, whereas left ventricular diastolic filling improved after therapy with a significant increase of M1/M2 ratio from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.02). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that cilazapril 5 mg/day is effective in reducing blood pressure in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. This normalization of blood pressure measurements is paralleled by a significant decrease of left ventricular mass index and by an improvement of left ventricular diastolic filling.", 
    "61": "The hemodynamic effects of acute intravenous administration of nitroprusside, dobutamine, enalaprilat, and digoxin was investigated in a canine model of chronic heart failure (CHF) produced by multiple sequential intracoronary microembolizations. Dobutamine (4 micrograms/kg/min) increased cardiac output (2.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.4 l/min; p < .001) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF; 26 +/- 1 vs. 30 +/- 4%; p < .01), and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR; 3620 +/- 170 vs. 2470 +/- 190 dynes sec cm-5; p < .001). Nitroprusside (3 micrograms/kg/min) acted as a venodilator; it decreased pulmonary artery wedge pressure (16 +/- 1 vs. 13 +/- 1 mmHg; p < .01) and SVR (3730 +/- 440 vs. 3210 +/- 280 dynes sec cm-5; NS) but had no effect on cardiac output. Enalaprilat (1.875 mg) produced a significant increase of cardiac output (3.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.5 l/min; p < .001) and LVEF (22 +/- 1 vs. 30 +/- 1%; p < .01), and decreased SVR (3280 +/- 400 vs. 2450 +/- 250 dynes sec cm-5; p < .01). Intravenous digoxin at a cumulative dose of 0.75 mg increased LVEF (23 +/- 2 vs. 31 +/- 2%; p < .01) but had no effect on SVR. These data indicate that this canine model of CHF responds to acute pharmacologic intervention in a manner comparable to that seen in patients with CHF. Accordingly, this model may be a useful tool for the preclinical evaluation of new drugs targeted toward the treatment of CHF and for investigating the mechanisms of action of drugs currently used for the treatment of this disease state.",

Local oedema formation, in response to intradermally-injected agents, was measured in male New Zealand white rabbits as the local accumulation of i.v. injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin into skin sites. 3. Phoneutria nigriventer venom (10-30 micrograms/site) increased vascular permeability, which was inhibited by trasylol (10 micrograms/site) and the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-BK (3 nmol/site) and Hoe 140 (0.3 nmol/site). In addition, the oedema induced by the venom was potentiated by the kinase II inhibitor, captopril (1 nmol/site). The lipoxygenase inhibitor, BWA4C (10 nmol/site) and the PAF antagonist, WEB 2086 (100 nmol/site) had no effect on the venom-induced increase in vascular permeability. 4. Incubation of rabbit plasma with Phoneutria nigriventer venom in vitro did not cause bradykinin formation. Further, the plasma kallikrein inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 micrograms/site), had no effect on the venom-induced increase in vascular permeability in rabbit skin. 5. These results indicate that the oedema produced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom is dependent on the activation of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system.",

The interaction of fosinopril with magnesium ions was studied in a solution model system in which methanol was used as the solvent and magnesium acetate as the source of metal ions. Kinetic analysis indicated the degradation to be a bimolecular process, with the rate being first order in both metal ion and fosinopril concentration. The degradation products II, III, and IV effectively retarded the magnesium ion mediated reaction of fosinopril. Based on the results of 31P-NMR, 1H-NMR, Mn(II)-EPR spectroscopy experiments and mass spectrometry, a mechanism is postulated for this transformation. A key reactive intermediate has been characterized that supports the proposed mechanism. The results can account for the observed degradation profile of the fosinopril sodium in a prototype tablet formulation.", 
    "73": "The long-term effects of different antihypertensive regimens were studied in uninephrectomized beagles with alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was elevated (P < 0.05) in untreated diabetic dogs. Treatment of diabetic dogs with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI; lisinopril), a calcium antagonist (CA;TA-3090), or both lowered MAP. At one year, the RBF, GFR, and SNGFR were similarly elevated (P < 0.05) in all groups of diabetic dogs. The increase in SNGFR present in untreated diabetic dogs was primarily attributable to an increased (P < 0.05) glomerular capillary pressure (PGC). Treatment with lisinopril lowered the PGC to a mean value that was indistinguishable from that for nondiabetic dogs. In contrast, diabetic dogs treated with TA-3090 had an elevated PGC. While untreated diabetic dogs exhibited marked increases in glomerular volume (P < 0.05 vs. nondiabetic dogs), treatment with lisinopril and TA-3090, either alone or in combination, blunted the extent of glomerular hypertrophy observed in diabetic dogs (P < 0.05 vs. untreated diabetic dogs). Proteinuria was similarly reduced (P < 0.05 vs. untreated diabetic dogs) in dogs treated with lisinopril and TA-3090. Combination therapy of diabetic dogs produced a further significant (P < 0.05) decrement in proteinuria. We conclude that although treatment of diabetic dogs with either lisinopril or TA-3090 results in differential effects on PGC; each produces a similar decrement in proteinuria. Further, combination therapy has a greater effect on proteinuria than either agent alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Renal transplantation is frequently accompanied by systemic hypertension. In the present study we evaluated the effect of 2.5 mg lisinopril in 12 hypertensive and proteinuric renal graft recipients with stable graft function over 3 months. Only patients with absence of renal artery stenosis, at least as judged by technetium-scan imaging, were included. Lisinopril was effective in lowering systemic blood pressure. Mean arterial pressure was unchanged despite reduction of concomitant antihypertensive medication. Mean serum creatinine was unchanged during the study (1.95 +/- 0.8 mg/dl in the pretreatment period vs. 1.77 +/- 0.76 mg/dl in the intervention period, n.s.). Glomerular filtration rate remained stable (62.75 +/- 21.96 vs. 60.17 +/- 18.27 ml/min/1.73 m2, n.s.) whereas renal plasma flow increased (224.75 +/- 91.66 vs. 244.92 +/- 94.13 ml/min/1.73m2, P < 0.01), leading to a drop in filtration fraction (31.4 +/- 12.4 vs. 26.8 +/- 8.6, n.s.). Renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced following angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy (26,447 +/- 14,574 vs. 23,425 +/- 12,430 dyne sec cm-5/1.73 m2, P < 0.01). Mean daily proteinuric decreased significantly (2.98 +/- 2.06 vs. 2.06 +/- 2.29 g, P < 0.01) whereas in a group of patients with comparable blood pressure but without ACE inhibitor therapy and similar degree of proteinuria, 24-hr proteinuria remained stable. No severe side effects were observed--in particular, mean serum potassium showed only a slight increase and no clinically significant hyperkalemic condition was observed. When lisinopril therapy was withdrawn after 3 months, blood pressure increased in all patients, requiring reinstitution of additional antihypertensive medication. Renal hemodynamic parameters and daily proteinuria returned to baseline values. We conclude that 2.5 mg lisinopril daily was safe and effective in this group of renal transplant recipients and showed a good antihypertensive as well as antiproteinuric effect.", 
    "75": "The oxygen free radical system has been reported to be activated by influenza virus infection in the lungs. However, the involvement of oxygen radicals in viral myocarditis is still unknown. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and potent free radical scavenger with a sulfhydryl group, was effective for the treatment of viral myocarditis, while enalapril, an ACE inhibitor without a sulfhydryl group, was not effective against acute myocarditis. In this study, we investigated the role of oxygen radicals in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and the therapeutic effects of agents with a sulfhydryl group. 4-wk-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with the encephalomyocarditis virus, and treated with captopril or N,2-mercapto-propionyl glycine (MPG), a sulfhydryl-containing amino acid derivative without ACE inhibiting property, from days 4 to 14. On day 14, captopril and MPG significantly improved survival of mice and myocardial injury (necrosis, cellular infiltration, and calcification) in a dose-dependent manner compared with the infected control group. Thus, captopril and MPG were effective for the treatment of virus-induced myocarditis. Furthermore, a striking induction of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and copper/zinc SOD (Cu/Zn-SOD) mRNAs in infected hearts was found (8-13-fold for Mn-SOD and 4-11-fold for Cu/Zn-SOD) when compared with age-matched uninfected mice hearts. MPG completely inhibited the increase of both mRNAs, even when treatment was started on day 4. Thus, oxygen radicals may play an important role in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis, and a therapeutic approach by eliminating oxygen radicals seems possible.", 
    "76": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) are implicated in the metabolism of several peptides involved in blood pressure and sodium homeostasis control, such as angiotensins, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), bradykinin and endothelin. The effects of a highly selective NEP inhibitor (NEPI), retrothiorphan, of a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), enalaprilat, and of the combination, CEI + NEPI, were assessed in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and renovascular hypertensive rats. NEPI increased diuresis, natriuresis and urinary cyclic GMP (cGMP), ANF and bradykinin in the three models. NEPI decreased blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats only, whereas CEI decreased blood pressure in SHRs and renovascular hypertensive rats only and increased plasma renin. CEI had no effect on urinary aldosterone or bradykinin in any of the three models. CEI + NEPI increased diuresis and natriuresis in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats and SHRs, and increased urinary cGMP, ANF and bradykinin and plasma renin levels. CEI and NEPI interacted significantly to decrease blood pressure and to increase urinary cGMP in SHRs only. Hence, NEPI increases diuresis, natriuresis and urinary cGMP, ANF and bradykinin in experimental hypertension, whereas CEI acts on blood pressure and increases in plasma renin in SHRs and renovascular hypertensive rats. The significant interaction between CEI and NEPI to decrease blood pressure in SHRs indicates that simultaneous blockade of the two metallopeptidases results in potentiation of the hypotensive effect and that the SHRs appear to be a good model for studying NEP and ACE coinhibition. Finally, NEP rather than ACE appears to be involved in bradykinin renal catabolism in experimental hypertension.", 
    "77": "Nitrate tolerance has been explained by 1) a direct loss of pharmacological effect due to reduced bioconversion and 2) an indirect effect due to activation of the renin/angiotensin system and counter-regulatory vasoconstriction. The sulfhydryl compound N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to attenuate and partly counteract tolerance to nitrates, and this effect has been attributed to a nitrate/sulfhydryl interaction and increased production of vasoactive intermediates. The effect of NAC on counter-regulatory mechanisms is, however, unknown. This study examined whether NAC modulates the function of the renin/angiotensin system in normal rats and in nitrate-tolerant healthy volunteers. Animal study: Conscious rats received NAC (5 mmol/kg/hr i.v., n = 8) or placebo (N-acetylserine, n = 8). Two hours of NAC infusion significantly reduced the pressor effect of angiotensin I (ANG I) by 39 +/- 14% (mean +/- SEM) and reduced angiotensin converting enzyme activity by 31% in plasma (N-acetylserine: 74 +/- 9 nmol/min/mg, NAC: 51 +/- 7) and 43% in kidney (N-acetylserine: 0.9 +/- 0.3, NAC: 0.5 +/- 0.1 nmol/min/mg protein) (P < .05). Clinical study: Isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg/hr) was infused into six male volunteers for 48 hr. NAC (2 g i.v. followed by 5 mg/kg/hr) was co-infused from 24 to 48 hr. Plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) increased during the first 24 hr of isosorbide dinitrate infusion and decreased from 28 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 2 ng/l after 2 hr of NAC infusion (P < .05). The results suggest that sulfhydryl supplementation modifies the function of the renin/angiotensin system in vivo, an effect probably mediated by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "Incubation with captopril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, for 24 hours at concentrations up to 10(-7) M inhibited endothelin-1 secretion by endothelial cells. This inhibition of endothelin-1 secretion was reversed by coincubation with 3 x 10(-3) M NG-nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis. Furthermore, captopril enhanced the production of nitric oxide in endothelial cells, suggesting that enhancement of nitric oxide production participates in captopril-induced inhibition of endothelin-1 secretion. Moreover, in the presence of 10(-6) M D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, captopril did not inhibit but rather stimulated endothelin-1 secretion, whereas bradykinin inhibited endothelin-1 secretion, and this inhibition by bradykinin was reversed by coincubation with NG-nitro-L-arginine. In addition, enhancement of nitric oxide production induced by either captopril or bradykinin was inhibited by D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin. Although 10(-6) M des-Arg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin, a bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist, did not affect nitric oxide production by bradykinin, it enhanced the inhibition of endothelin-1 secretion by bradykinin. Furthermore, 10(-7) M des-Arg9-bradykinin, a bradykinin B1 receptor agonist, stimulated endothelin-1 secretion by endothelial cells. These findings suggest that angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor inhibits endothelin-1 secretion by the accumulation of endogenous bradykinin in endothelial cells and that the inhibition of endothelin-1 secretion by bradykinin is mediated via B2 receptors.", 
    "79": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.1.15.1) exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. Phase separation in Triton X-114 and a competitive e.l.i.s.a. have been employed to characterize the activity which post-translationally converts the amphipathic, membrane-bound form of ACE in pig kidney microvilli into a hydrophilic, soluble form. This secretase activity was enriched to a similar extent as other microvillar membrane proteins, was tightly membrane-associated, being resistant to extensive washing of the microvillar membranes with 0.5 M NaCl, and displayed a pH optimum of 8.4. The ACE secretase was not affected by inhibitors of serine-, thiol- or aspartic-proteases, nor by reducing agents or alpha 2-macroglobulin. The metal chelators, EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, inhibited the secretase activity, with, in the case of EDTA, an inhibitor concentration of 2.5 mM causing 50% inhibition. In contrast, EGTA inhibited the secretase by a maximum of 15% at a concentration of 10 mM. The inhibition of EDTA was reactivated substantially (83%) by Mg2+ ions, and partially (34% and 29%) by Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions respectively. This EDTA-sensitive secretase activity was also present in microsomal membranes prepared from pig lung and testis, and from human lung and placenta, but was absent from human kidney and human and pig intestinal brush-border membranes. The form of ACE released from the microvillar membrane by the secretase co-migrated on SDS/PAGE with ACE purified from pig plasma, thus the action and location of the secretase would be consistent with it possibly having a role in the post-translational proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound ACE to generate the soluble form found in blood, amniotic fluid, seminal plasma and other body fluids.", 
    "80": "We investigated the release of carboxypeptidase M (CPM), neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase, NEP), and angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II, ACE) and their contribution to bradykinin metabolism in the rat lung. The P3, membrane-enriched fraction of the homogenized lung was rich in all three peptidases. The activities of CPM and NEP were high in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid but lower in alveolar macrophages indicating that they originate from other cells present on the alveolar surface. In situ perfusion of rat lung with buffer that contained either deoxycholate or melittin or compound 48/80, produced lung edema. CPM, NEP, and ACE activities were recovered both in edema and perfusate fluid. The level of CPM and NEP was higher in edema fluid whereas, in contrast, more ACE activity was released into the perfusate. To evaluate the effect of peptidase inhibitors on changes in vascular permeability induced by bradykinin in the in situ perfused rat lung we measured the increase in lung weight as an index of increased vascular permeability or edema. Combined inhibition of either ACE plus NEP or ACE plus CPM augmented the effect of a subthreshold dose of bradykinin. Inhibitors of ACE, NEP, or CPM given alone and a combination of NEP plus CPM inhibitors did not enhance the bradykinin effect. Our results indicate that CPM, NEP, and ACE although present on different lung cells, synergistically modulate bradykinin effects. The different ratios of distribution of these enzymes in the perfusate and in edema fluid may not be due only to their presence on different pulmonary cells but also to their different anchoring mechanisms to plasma membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of citalopram, a second generation antidepressant agent producing no beta-down-regulation, on the receptors and second messenger systems related to noradrenergic transmission in the cerebral cortex of the rat. We confirmed that citalopram does not bind to alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta 1-adrenoceptors, but we found that it attenuates the inhibitory action of the protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, on the noradrenergic response from alpha 1-adrenoceptor. In contrast to most antidepressants, chronic treatment with citalopram does not produce beta-down-regulation, but increases the responses to noradrenaline from beta-adrenoceptors without increasing the beta 1-adrenoceptor density. Chronic treatment with citalopram also increases the maximal response from alpha 1-adrenoceptor. The results indicate that beta-down-regulation is not a necessary characteristic of an efficient antidepressant drug.",

Accordingly, it is important to decrease blood pressure and maintain it in an acceptable range to lessen morbidity and mortality. When nonpharmacological therapy fails, drug therapy should be instituted. The ideal drugs lower blood pressure, have few adverse side effects, and may have additional benefits on coexisting maladies. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors are excellent first-line drugs because they have few adverse effects and may have additional benefits on cardiac and renal status.

Replacing two of these bonds may well lead to significantly tighter binding; replacing two others is predicted to significantly diminish the binding affinity. Also, for three of the peptide bonds fluoroethylene replacements could lead to increased binding of free energies of the inhibitors. Our results should be considered as predictive since there are, as yet, no experimental results on such peptide replacements as enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "88": "Using isolated arteries, we demonstrated a marked difference in the angiotensin II-forming systems between human and rodent vessels. In human arteries, only 30-40% of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II depended on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and the rest of the angiotensin II formation was ascribed to chymostatin-sensitive angiotensin II-generating enzyme (CAGE). On the contrary, angiotensin II formation in rodent arteries totally depended upon ACE, without any sign of CAGE involvement. Such a marked species-difference can be relevant to the reported difference between humans and rodents in the ACE inhibitor effects on the myointimal hyperplasia after intimal balloon injury.", 
    "89": "This study evaluates 33 patients suffering from mild-moderate arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure over 95 mmHg) and with concomitant indications of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy at echocardiography. Twenty patients completed the trial according to the criteria established in the protocol and were found suitable for evaluation of the results at the end of the study. Ten patients were treated with 40 mg of nifedipine retard tablets, administered twice (1 x 20 mg tablet twice daily) and 10 patients were treated with a single administration of 20 mg quinapril (1 x 20 mg tablet per day). Total follow-up was performed for one year (variability 12-14 months) with evaluation of the pressure response at 1-3-6-12 months and clinical evaluation and echocardiographic control for comparison with the baseline at the end of the study. The left ventricular mass values measured at the end of the study presented a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.001) with respect to the baseline in both groups. In the patients treated with quinapril the percentage regression of left ventricular hypertrophy was 19.39%, and slightly higher (19.5%) in the patients treated with nifedipine. Finally, although the series is perhaps too limited to draw conclusions, the finding that the indicators of diastolic filling of the left ventricle improved, and, in particular, were correlated with an increase in the speed of the first fast filling phase, and thus that there was a partial improvement in left ventricular compliance, is important.",

At present, incremental improvement such as that provided by ACE inhibitors, and now possibly by new agents such as flosequinan, are what we have to offer our patients, short of transplantation, to control symptoms and increase exercise tolerance. No one knows what the future holds for these patients, but one can hope that the current therapy and those drugs being studied in clinical trials will provide agents that will continue to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with current therapies. However, only so much can be done with drugs in the failing heart, and research must continue in the area of cardiac transplantation as well as in the area of totally implantable ventricular assist devices.", 
    "91": "1. The hypotensive effects of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 0.5 mg kg-1) but not of 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1, 0.125 mg kg-1) in anaesthetized rats were attenuated following a seven day (using a q.i.d. dosing schedule) oral treatment with isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN; 5 mg kg-1) indicative of the induction of tolerance to GTN but not to SIN-1. The hypotensive effects of GTN did not decline when the sulphydryl (SH) containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-1), captopril (CPT, 5 mg kg-1) or the structurally unrelated SH-containing, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 mg kg-1) but not the non-SH-containing ACE-I, enalaprilat (ENA, 5 mg kg-1) were given together with IS-5-MN for the seven days treatment. 2. The attenuated hypotensive effects of GTN (0.5 mg kg-1) in rats treated with IS-5-MN were also restored when CPT (1 mg kg-1) or NAC (2.5 mg kg-1) but not ENA (1 mg kg-1) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30 min before GTN. Furthermore, in control rats, CPT or NAC but not ENA given i.p. 30 min before GTN, potentiated its haemodynamic effects. These effects were blocked by methylene blue (10 mg kg-1). At the same doses, CPT or NAC did not affect the hypotensive effects of SIN-1. 3. The reduced ability of cultured tolerant smooth muscle cells (SMC, 24 x 103 cells) or endothelial cells(EC, 40 x 103 cells) to potentiate the anti-platelet effects of GTN (44 microM) was restored by CPT or NAC but not by ENA or glutathione (all at 0.5 mM). Potentiation of the anti-platelet effects of tolerant SMC or EC by CPT or NAC was abolished by co-incubation with oxyhaemoglobin (Oxy-Hb, 10 microM)indicative of nitric oxide (NO) formation.4. When GTN (150-2400 microM) was incubated with CPT, NAC or glutathione but not ENA (all at 0.1 mM) for 30 min in Krebs buffer at 37 degrees C a concentration-dependent increase in nitrite (NO2-)formation was observed. 5. The antiplatelet effects of GTN (5.5-352 microM) were potentiated by co-incubation with CPT or NAC but not with ENA or glutathione (all at 0.5 mM). The concentration of GTN required to inhibit platelet aggregation by 50% (IC50) was 110 +/- 2 microM for GTN alone, 14 +/- 2 microM for GTN in the presence of NAC and 30 +/- 2 microM for GTN in the presence of CPT. The potentiation of the effects of GTN by CPT or NAC was inhibited by co-incubation with Oxy-Hb (10 microM). By themselves, CPT or NAC did not inhibit platelet aggregation.6. The ability of CPT to restore (a) the haemodynamic effects of GTN in tolerant rats and (b) the reduced capacity of tolerant SMC or EC to potentiate the anti-platelet effects of GTN is not related to its ACE inhibitory activity.7. CPT also potentiated the hypotensive effects of GTN in non-tolerant rats, and in vitro CPT released NO from GTN in the absence of a GTN to NO converting cell, so that it is unlikely that reversal of tolerance by CPT is due to the replenishment of intracellular thiols. Rather it can be explained by the ability of CPT to release NO from GTN in the extracellular space. This extracellular formation of NO from GTN by CPT would then compensate for the impaired enzymic biotransformation of GTN to NO that develops during tolerance as was originally proposed for NAC.", 
    "92": "In cats with extracorporeal circulation arterial blood pressure and thrombolysis were assayed. In this model apart from their hypotensive properties kallikrein (3-10 units/kg, i.v.) and captopril (> 200 micrograms/kg, i.v.) dissipated blood clots which were preformed on superfused collagen strips. Captopril at a lower dose of 50 micrograms/kg i.v. potentiated the thrombolytic effect of kallikrein while aprotinin (100,000 unit/kg, i.v.) abolished it. Thrombolysis by kallikrein was mediated by an unstable principle which was decomposed by blood during 15 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. Generation of this principle was inhibited by pretreatment of animals with aspirin (50 mg/kg, i.v.). The above analysis points to prostacyclin which owing to its platelet-suppressant and fibrinolytic properties induces thrombolysis when released by kinins.", 
    "93": "Thirty essential hypertensive subjects had their BP measured by 24h ambulatory monitoring before (first placebo period) and after exposure to antihypertensive therapy with either enalapril (four weeks) or nitrendipine (six weeks). Similar measures of BP were obtained during a second placebo period intercalated between the two active drugs. The 24h averages of systolic and diastolic pressures were higher during placebo (148 +/- 3/91 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively) than during treatment periods. Four weeks of treatment with enalapril reduced arterial pressure to a 24h average of 137 +/- 1/86 +/- 1 mmHg while nitrendipine given for six weeks lowered BP to an average of 135 +/- 1/84 +/- 1 mmHg. The antihypertensive effect of the drugs was of a comparable magnitude (P > 0.05). In addition both drugs produced analogous reductions in BP during the day (07.00 to 23.00 h). In contrast, the nocturnal fall in BP was significantly greater during treatment with nitrendipine. Average systolic and diastolic pressures between 23.00 h and 07.00 h were 133 +/- 1 mmHg and 82 +/- 2 mmHg with enalapril compared with 129 +/- 3 mmHg (P < 0.01) and 77 +/- 3 mmHg (P < 0.01) with nitrendipine, respectively. These data suggest that antihypertensive agents show important differences in terms of their action on the mechanisms that regulate BP during sleep. Medications that amplify the otherwise physiological fall in BP during sleep may add risk to patients with impaired coronary vasodilator reserve owing to ventricular hypertrophy, coronary atherosclerosis, or both.",

Active treatment consisted of nitredipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), if necessary to reduce SBP to < 150 mmHg and by > or = 20 mmHg. Matching placebos were used in the control group. This analysis was restricted to 18 months of follow-up. The placebo (n = 456) and active treatment (n = 485) groups had similar characteristics at randomisation (sitting pressure 176/85 mmHg; age 73 years). SBP fell (P < 0.001) on average 10 mmHg more on active treatment than on placebo and DBP 4 mmHg more. Fewer patients remained on monotherapy in the placebo than in the active treatment group (P < 0.001); on placebo the second and third line medications were started earlier (P < 0.001). Nitrendipine tablets were discontinued in nine patients on placebo and in 29 patients assigned to active treatment (P < 0.001). In conclusion, a significant BP reduction can be achieved and maintained in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension treated with a calcium antagonist (associated with a converting-enzyme inhibitor and a thiazide, where necessary). Whether this BP reduction results in a clinically meaningful decrease of cardiovascular complications is under investigation.",

Both doses significantly increased UETV, from nondetectable (ND) levels to 155 +/- 54 (P < .03) and 450 +/- 86 fg/min (P < .001), respectively.

Infusions of A-II with its nonspecific antagonist, saralasin, resulted in a further increase in UETV to 647 +/- 126 and 782 +/- 117 fg/min (P < .002), respectively. However, infusion of A-II with its specific antagonist, losartan, completely blocked its stimulatory effect on UETV.

Groups 2, 3, and 4 received cyclosporine (CyA), approximately 9 mg/kg.day, in their food. In addition, Group 3 received enalapril and Group 4 received minoxidil, hydrochlorothiazide, and reserpine. Time-averaged monthly systolic blood pressure was equal in Groups 1 and 2 (136 +/- 1 and 135 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively). Antihypertensive agents reduced average systolic blood pressure in Groups 3 and 4 (116 +/- 1 and 117 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively). Morphometric studies showed that 12 months of CyA treatment caused interstitial fibrosis with an increase in the fractional volume of cortical interstitium (VvInt: Group 2, 20 +/- 1%; Group 1, 11 +/- 1%) and a reduction in mean glomerular volume (VG. Group 2, (2.00 +/- 0.06) x 10(6) mu 3; Group 1, (2.48 +/- 0.06) x 10(6) mu 3). These structural changes were accompanied by a significant reduction in GFR (Group 2, 2.27 +/- 0.10 mL/min; Group 1, 2.76 +/- 0.10 mL/min). Cotreatment with enalapril reduced interstitial fibrosis (VvInt, 14 +/- 1%) and maintained VG (2.23 +/- 0.08 x 10(6) mu 3) and GFR (2.56 +/- 0.08 mL/min) at near-normal values in Group 3. In contrast, the combination antihypertensive regimen increased the extent of interstitial fibrosis (VvInt, 24 +/- 1%) and further lowered VG (1.72 +/- 0.05 x 10(6) mu 3) and GFR (1.72 +/- 0.05 mL/min) in Group 4. These results show that sustained treatment with a moderate dose of CyA causes interstitial fibrosis and impairs renal function in rats. The administration of enalapril, but not minoxidil, reserpine, and hydrochlorothiazide, limits renal injury in this model.", 
    "98": "To elucidate the effect of bradykinin (BK) on airway epithelial ion transport function and its modulation by endogenous peptidases, we studied the electrical properties of canine cultured tracheal epithelium under short-circuited conditions in vitro. Addition of BK to the mucosal side of Ussing chamber increased short-circuit current (SCC) in a dose-dependent manner, the maximal rise from the baseline value (delta SCC max) and the concentration required to produce a half-maximal effect being 7.1 +/- 0.7 microA/cm2 (p < 0.001) and 3.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(-7) M, respectively. This effect was greatly attenuated by the B2-receptor antagonist (D-Arg, Hyp3, Thi5,8, d-Phe7)-BK but not by the B1-receptor antagonist (Des-Arg9, Leu8)-BK. Blockade of angiotensin converting enzyme and aminopeptidase P by captopril and mercaptoethanol did not alter the BK-induced increase in SCC. On the other hand, phosphoramidon and MERGAPTA, inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase and carboxypeptidase N, respectively, strengthened the effect of BK. These results suggest that BK stimulates airway epithelial electrical properties through the activation of B2-receptor subtype, and that endogenous peptidases including neutral nedopeptidase and carboxypeptidase N may play a modulatory role in this action of BK.", 
    "99": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term (12 months) effects of captopril and nifedipine retard on the lipid profile of the non obese, non diabetic and normolipemic essential hypertensives. In a multicenter, randomised, open study we included 185 mild-moderate essential hypertensives responders to captopril (n = 96) or nifedipine retard (n = 89) in monotherapy, and with a total cholesterol between 200-239 mg/dl. No dietetic recommendations were given to the patients, except for moderate salt restriction. After 1 year follow-up, our results show that both drugs improved the lipid profile of the hypertensives. Patients with nifedipine retard showed a statistical significant decrease in the level of the total and LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B; while total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apoproteins significantly decreased in the group treated with captopril. The possible pharmacological mechanisms involved in these beneficial effects are discussed; concluding that these properties made much more attractive these drugs to be used as first step therapy in the essential hypertensives.", 
    "100": "In a single-blind, in-patient, crossover study, the influence on the circadian blood pressure (BP) profile of the 9:00 a.m. versus the 9:00 p.m. acute administration of a single dose of benazepril 10 mg, a new angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, was assessed in 10 hypertensive patients by means of 24-hour intraarterial ambulatory BP monitoring. Mean 24-hour BP for the three treatments (placebo, benazepril a.m., benazepril p.m.) were 155/93, 131/83 and 138/86 mmHg, respectively. No significant differences between the two benazepril schedules were found in terms of either 24-hour or day-time and night-time mean BP values. However, hourly averages showed that benazepril a.m. had a more sustained antihypertensive effect than benazepril p.m., where a loss of efficacy was observed 19 hours after the administration. BP responses to static and dynamic exercise and to cold pressor test were unchanged after both benazepril schedules, as were BP peaks. These results demonstrate that acute benazepril administration markedly reduces systolic and diastolic BP. The morning administration is preferable because it more effectively covers the whole 24 hours than an evening dose.", 
    "101": "We have demonstrated that angiotensinogen is synthesized by 3T3-F442A cells and is hydrolyzed to angiotensins I and II (ANG I and II) by this model adipocyte system. This study was designed to determine whether ANG I is generated by renin or some other enzyme and where the formation of ANG I and/or II occurs in 3T3-F442A cells. Renin mRNA was not detected by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)(+)-selected RNA from cultures of fully differentiated adipocytes nor by the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction, implying that renin is not synthesized in this model adipocyte system. Hydrolysis of angiotensinogen to ANG I and II was demonstrated to be associated with the cell but not the media. Inhibitors, including EDTA, aimed at inactivating enzymes belonging to the serine, acid, or aspartyl proteases, and metalloproteases were ineffective in preventing the formation of either ANG I or II. Therefore the model adipocyte 3T3-F442A cell system forms ANG I and II in the absence of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The unidentified enzymes responsible for peptide formation are associated with the cell itself.",

At the time of publication, all available clinical trials studying the effects of ACE inhibitors on postinfarction ventricular remodeling were included, regardless of whether morbidity and mortality were assessed. Data from the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) and Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study II (CONSENSUS II) trials include almost 10,000 patients. Data were extracted by two independent observers. Data quality and validity were assessed based on sample size, stratification of study population, and statistical power of the studies.", 
    "106": "ACE inhibitors may prevent the deleterious consequences of AMI, including ventricular remodeling and neurohumoral activation. Ventricular hypertrophy begins acutely following infarction, an early physiologic response to myocardial injury. Hemodynamic benefits from the initial phase of left ventricular hypertrophy include increased ventricular working capacity, normalized systolic wall stress, and maintenance of stroke volume. Although acute dilatation may delay hemodynamic deterioration for six to eight months, it also results in reduced coronary reserve, decreased ventricular compliance, and altered myocardial contractility. With chronic dilatation, the beneficial effects reach a plateau, stroke volume decreases, contractility is reduced, and cardiac failure may ensue. Ventricular hypertrophy is associated with worsened prognosis following infarction and may be the most important single determinant of late prognosis. Ventricular hypertrophy contributes to postinfarction heart failure, angina, and sudden death. Clinical trials show a beneficial effect of the ACE inhibitor captopril on the prevention of left ventricular dysfunction. Although captopril therapy significantly improved survival and myocardial function following AMI in the SAVE trial, these results cannot be generalized to all patient subpopulations. The CONSENSUS II trial demonstrated a decreased survival rate when enalapril was administered within 24 hours of AMI, indicating that timing of therapy may be an important consideration. Captopril therapy may positively affect outcome when initiated 3-16 days following infarction in patients with ejection fractions below 40 percent and who have no signs of ischemia or heart failure. Based on the CONSENSUS II results, enalapril therapy immediately following AMI cannot be recommended.", 
    "107": "Clinical trials have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors can limit ventricular hypertrophy following AMI, resulting in clinical benefit and improved survival. These effects may be secondary to modulation of neurohumoral activation or the antiischemic effect of ACE inhibitors, which may also reduce the incidence of reinfarction. Early intervention with ACE inhibitors (within 3-16 days of infarction) can slow the progression of cardiovascular disease and improve the survival rate.", 
    "108": "Results of a previous study showed that angiotensin II (AII) inhibited the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal granule cells in response to dorsomedial perforant path stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rats. The results of present experiments demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of LTP induction under the same conditions due to ethanol (EtOH) administered by stomach tube and diazepam (DZ) injected IP. The inhibition of LTP induction by EtOH and DZ can be blocked by saralasin (SAR) applied directly to the dorsal hippocampus and by lorsartan (DuP 753) administered IP. Lorsartan or a metabolite crosses the blood-brain barrier because it also blocks the inhibition of LTP induction due to AII administration directly into the dorsal hippocampus. Lorsartan is a competitive antagonist of the AT1 subtype AII receptor. Therefore, the AII and the EtOH and DZ inhibition of LTP induction are mediated by the AII subtype receptor AT1. AIII and the AT2 antagonist PD123319 did not produce any significant effects. These in vivo effects can be reproduced in brain slices and therefore cannot be attributed to other factors, such as the urethane. In addition, electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) inhibits LTP induction, and the inhibition can be blocked by SAR. These data on LH stimulation indicate that LH AII-containing neurons send axons into the hippocampus that inhibit the induction of LTP. These results not only provide new information on a neurotransmitter involved in the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines and ethanol-induced memory blackouts, but also testable hypotheses concerning recent observations that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors elevate mood and improve certain cognitive processes in the elderly.", 
    "109": "Pentane, a product of lipid peroxidation, has been detected in situations involving ischemic injury. Such injury may be limited if lipid peroxidation can be controlled by antioxidants. The role of lipid peroxidation in chronic heart failure (CHF) was assessed by measuring breath pentane in patients with CHF vs. age matched controls. The effect of a free radical scavenger on pentane released during CHF was also measured. Pentane levels were correlated with the daily dose of captopril, a sulfhydril-containing drug used to treat CHF, which is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. To separate the scavenging effects of captopril from the pharmacologic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors, a crossover study using a nonsulfhydril inhibitor was used. Patients with CHF excreted (p < 0.005) high concentrations of pentane (5.7 +/- 2.1 vs. control 3.6 +/- 1.2 nmol/l). Patients treated with captopril also had significantly higher (p < 0.05) excretion of pentane than the control patients (4.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.2 nmol/l). The dose of captopril was inversely proportional to the concentration of pentane excreted (r = 0.55, p < 0.05). Pentane excretion during captopril therapy was significantly lower before (p < 0.01) and after (p < 0.02) nonsulfhydril inhibitor therapy.",

The sensitivity and specificity of the baseline study were 63% (10/16) and 63% (12/19), respectively, based on the split renal function study in which the lower limit of normal was assumed to be 42% of the total renal uptake. Captopril renoscintigraphy yielded 67% (12/18) sensitivity and 76% (19/25) specificity. The low specificity of CRS was due to the application of a prospective criterion of the captopril-induced reduction rate (CRR) of less than -20%, which was calculated from the renal uptake before and after captopril. When criteria of CRR less than -25% were used, the specificity of CRS was improved to 96%, but the sensitivity declined to 61%. Changes in the configuration of the renogram induced by captopril also had high specificity but low sensitivity. Renovascular hypertension was most likely when criteria for both CRR and the renogram were fulfilled. These criteria often were diagnostic in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis that showed variable scintigraphic responses to captopril challenge. Captopril renoscintigraphy is a very specific means to evaluate RVH, but may have limitations in certain clinical situations such as poorly preserved function of the affected kidney, prior long-term administration of captopril, prior surgical manipulation of stenotic renal artery, and chronic renal parenchymal damage.",

Renovascular hypertension was induced by surgical occlusion of one renal artery and stenosis of the other. One day after renal surgery, dogs were randomly assigned to two groups receiving for two months either the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor spirapril (n = 8) or a placebo capsule (n = 7). The two groups of dogs were compared to a control group of normotensive dogs (n = 7). After two months of treatment the elastic properties of the aorta were studied by computation of the beat to beat pressure-diameter hysteresis loops obtained during transient increase of pressure induced by bolus doses of angiotensin. The aortic pressure-diameter (P-D) relationship, obtained over a wide range, was fitted by an exponential fit (P = alpha.e beta D), where beta is the stiffness index. A decomposition of the P-D curve according to a biphasic model of the parallel arrangement of elastin and collagen enabled two pressure-diameter elastic moduli to be obtained, one representing the resistance to stretch at low pressure levels (elastic fibres and smooth muscle), and the other representing the resistance to stretch at the highest pressures (collagen fibres).",

    "119": "ACE inhibitors are becoming an important part of treatment in patients after acute myocardial infarction if they suffer from asymptomatic dysfunction of the left ventricle (ejection fraction of the left ventricle evaluated by echocardiography or isotope ventriculography 40% or less). It prevents the development of cardiac dilatation, it retards progression of the disease and the development of cardiac failure and reduces the necessity of hospitalization in patients with chronic cardiac failure (stage NYHA II-IV). ACE inhibitors are the drug of choice as they reduce significantly the general mortality of these patients. Treatment should not be initiated in the acute stage but after several days have elapsed after infarction, unless contraindications of treatment are present. Extensive investigations made during the past two years revealed moreover that ACE inhibitors effectively prevent also relapses of myocardial infarction or the development of unstable angina pectoris. Prevention of coronary attacks is most probably due to several effects of ACE inhibitors: a) reduction of blood pressure, b) coronary vasodilatation, c) the antiproliferative action of ACE inhibitors on vascular musculature, d) prevention of progression of atherosclerosis, e) prevention of myocardial hypertrophy, f) the favourable effect on endothelial function. So far we indicate for treatment with ACE inhibitors only patients after acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction. Only subsequent research will show whether treatment with ACE inhibitors is of value in patients with preserved left ventricular function.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were being taken by 22% of patients at the time of diagnosis of the atherosclerotic renovascular disease. Intervention to revascularize renal tissue by surgery or angioplasty was performed in 32 patients. Revascularization was not undertaken because of unilateral disease, patient preference, poor operative risk or renal size. The mean age for the nonintervention group was 66.9 years and 63.4 years for the intervention group. Peripheral vascular, disease was common in both groups (96% nonintervention group versus 86% intervention group). There was a statistically significant difference in improvement in renal function in the intervention group (34.4% versus 10.7%) in spite of more patients being dialysis dependent in the intervention group (28.1% versus 14.3%). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two groups although the trend was for better survival in the group with intervention.

The groups randomized to lisinopril or to nifedipine were not significantly different with respect to any demographic variable. An analysis of the pooled data from all centres demonstrated a significantly greater fall in both lying and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) on lisinopril than on nifedipine treatment (difference between treatments 7.70 +/- 3.34 mmHg; P = 0.02 and 10.2 +/- 3.30 mmHg; P = 0.003 for lying and standing SBP, respectively). However, this difference may be accounted for by the slightly higher mean SBP in the lisinopril treatment groups compared with the nifedipine group at the end of the placebo run-in period. Both treatments lowered lying and standing diastolic blood pressures (DBP) to the same extent and the response rates to the two treatments were the same. The effects of the two drugs on heart rate were indistinguishable from each other. There were six lisinopril and 12 nifedipine-treated patients withdrawn during randomized treatment (P = 0.22). Nineteen per cent of lisinopril patients reported an adverse event compared with 36% of nifedipine patients. The relative risk of an adverse event on lisinopril compared with nifedipine was 0.42 (confidence limits 1.027-0.172) a difference which approached statistical significance (P = 0.0573). Lisinopril produced a greater reduction in both lying and standing SBP than nifedipine and both were associated with equivalent reductions in DBP.

A reduction in blood pressure has also been shown to reduce the risk of strokes. In addition to other classical risk factors, such as abnormal serum lipids, diabetes and a genetic predisposition, recent studies have shown that elevated levels of fibrinogen and other clotting factors, elevated levels of renin and decreased levels of anti-oxidant vitamins such as E, C and beta-carotene can predict coronary heart disease and strokes. Thrombolytic therapy, aspirin and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction, and the latter two agents reduce mortality, re-infarction and strokes with long-term use. Treatment with intravenous magnesium and nitrates has shown promise but larger trials are required to confirm the results. Both aspirin and heparin have proven value in reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction and death in unstable angina. Following an acute myocardial infarction, long-term therapy with aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents and oral anticoagulants has been shown to reduce mortality and re-infarction. In patients with large infarcts associated with a low ejection fraction or heart failure, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality, hospitalization for heart failure and re-infarction. The use of diuretics to lower blood pressure reduces strokes. In contrast, calcium antagonists do not appear to consistently reduce mortality or prevent vascular events when used for primary or secondary prevention of either myocardial infarction or strokes.",

    "126": "Risk factors in elderly hypertensives: Recent large-scale clinical trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment in the elderly produces meaningful reductions in strokes and other cardiovascular events. However, the treatment of hypertension in older patients is often complicated by the presence of concomitant disorders. Clinical and silent myocardial ischemia, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and both systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, frequently coexist with hypertension. Additional clinical considerations in elderly hypertensives include a high prevalence of abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism and a tendency toward decreased renal function. Effects of different antihypertensive drugs: Although diuretics and conventional beta-blockers have been used as first-line drugs in the major clinical trials, some of their effects on metabolic parameters and on the myocardium can make them inappropriate in some patients. Newer drug classes, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers and, more recently, alpha 1-adrenergic blockers are effective alternatives. Dual-acting beta-blockers offer an important new approach for treating hypertension in elderly patients. Effects of carvedilol: Carvedilol possesses both beta- and alpha 1-blocking activity and appears to exhibit calcium channel blocking activity in animals. The alpha 1-blocking properties of this drug help to produce a desirable hemodynamic profile and facilitate appropriate blood pressure and heart rate responses to exercise. Carvedilol does not appear to adversely affect left ventricular systolic function and, in selected patients with heart failure, has been shown to increase the ejection fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Six weeks following partial renal ablation, the urinary protein excretion of the carvediol- (60 +/- 21 mg day-1) and captopril-treated (35 +/- 9 mg day-1) animals was less than 50% that of control rats (133 +/- 27 mg d-1). 3.

Plasma renin activity was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in captopril-treated rats (24.7 +/- 4.6 ng angiotensin I ml-1 h-1) than in either carvedilol-treated (7.9 +/- 1.4 ng angiotensin I ml-1 h-1) or control animals (7.4 +/- 1.0 ng angiotensin I ml-1 h-1). 4. Histological examination of the kidneys demonstrated a significantly reduced glomerular hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis in those animals receiving carvedilol or captopril compared to controls. 5. Serum carvedilol concentration measured every 6 h for 24 h was variable and ranged on average from 57 +/- 13 ng ml-1 at 16 h 00 min to 121 +/- 31 ng ml-1 at 03 h 00 min.

The preparations under these conditions had potent activity (IC50 = 0.26 mg protein/ml). Fractionation of the preparations on an ODS column with ethanol resulted in the production of more potent inhibitors. The most potent activity was obtained when eluting with 10% ethanol (IC50 = 0.015 mg protein/ml). This fraction was apparently rich in acidic amino acids, poor in hydrophobic ones, and effective for use as a physiologically functional food material by virtue of little bitterness, a fish odor and powerful ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "129": "The renin-angiotensin system is responsible for renovascular hypertension resulting from narrowing of the renal arteries. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) interrupt the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, causing a reduction in blood pressure. Several drugs of this family have been introduced since captopril was launched, including enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril and others. While they are effective antihypertensive agents, they can in some cases lead to deterioration of renal function, especially in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of a solitary kidney. ACE inhibitors must also be administered with caution to sodium-depleted patients. Calcium antagonists, presumed to be ideal for the treatment of low renin hypertension, have also proved to be effective in patients with renal artery stenosis, many of whom have severe refractory hypertension. These agents, in common with ACE inhibitors, may be useful for determining the lateralisation index used to establish the kidney responsible for hypertension.",

Anesthetized, open-chest rabbits were instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics and left ventricular pressure (LVP), from which LV + dP/dtmax was derived. Animals were subjected to 30-min left main coronary artery occlusion (marginal branch) followed by 2-h reperfusion. Ramiprilat (50 micrograms/kg) or saline was administered before reperfusion, and rabbits receiving HOE 140 were pretreated before occlusion (1 microgram/kg). In separate duration of action experiments (n = 6 each group), the above doses of ramiprilat or HOE 140 had significant vascular antagonism of sufficient duration against serial challenge with angiotensin I (AI) or bradykinin, respectively. After reperfusion, myocardial infarct size (IS) was determined by tetrazolium staining and expressed as a percentage of area at risk (AR). IS/AR% was significantly reduced in rabbits that received ramiprilat (20 +/- 6%, p < 0.05) as compared with those that received saline (41 +/- 6%), ramiprilat plus HOE 140 (47 +/- 2%), or HOE 140 alone (43 +/- 4%, mean +/- SEM). AR as a percentage of total LV mass was not different between any of the four treatment groups.

    "131": "Structural alterations after myocardial infarction (MI) in rats are usually examined only after death of the experimental animal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows repeated and noninvasive measurements of important structural [left ventricular (LV) mass, LV wall thickness, LV chamber radius] as well as function [LV end-systolic and LV end-diastolic volume, stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF)] parameters for a prolonged period. We describe our experience in a series of experiments in rats. Three weeks after MI, infarct size (IS) was determined by MRI and the rats were divided into two groups with equal IS. Three weeks later, treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril (10 mg/kg in food) or placebo was started. In both groups, the first MRI scan taken before the treatment showed moderately dilated left ventricles and signs of impaired LV function, i.e., an increase in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume and decreased EF. After 3-week treatment, no significant differences with respect to heart structure and function were detected as compared with those of untreated animals. Prolonged treatment for 10 weeks with spirapril resulted in significant reduction of LV dilatation, LV mass, and LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume, which was accompanied by improved EF. Hemodynamic examinations after treatment for 6 months showed, in contrast to control animals, no increase in right ventricular systolic pressure in animals receiving spirapril. Furthermore, histologic examination of perfusion-fixed hearts at the end of the study demonstrated more pronounced LV dilatation in control animals, thus confirming the in vivo MRI data. Delayed treatment with spirapril proved to have beneficial effects on structure and function of infarcted hearts within 10 weeks. Spirapril limited LV dilatation, reduced LV weight and LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, and improved EF.",

They were then randomly assigned to two distinct oral antihypertensive regimens with either calcium-channel blocker nifedipine (group 1, n = 7) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (group 2, n = 7). Three months later, a WI study identical to the first was repeated in the same hypertensive subjects. In group 1, treatment with nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (30 mg daily) significantly enhanced the natriuretic response to volume expansion by WI (peak value 405 +/- 82 mumol/min during WI plus nifedipine vs. 291 +/- 52 mumol/min during WI alone, p < 0.05). In group 2, treatment with lisinopril (20 mg daily) was associated with a blunted natriuretic response to volume expansion by WI (peak value 189 +/- 54 mumol/min during WI plus lisinopril vs. 320 +/- 53 mumol/min during WI alone; p < 0.025). A significant direct correlation between urinary sodium excretion (delta UNa V) and mean arterial pressure (delta MAP) was noted during WI plus nifedipine. Each long-term drug treatment was associated with a decrease in BP and hormonal changes of the same magnitude. Our data suggest that calcium antagonists could act as \"diuretic agents\" capable of counteracting the antinatriuretic effect of reduced renal perfusion pressure.", 
    "133": "Marked neointima formation occurs after balloon injury to the intima of rat arteries. Angiotensin II has been implicated as a growth factor in this process, since angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block neointima formation after injury. However, ACE is an important kininase, and its inhibitors may act in part by a kinin-mediated mechanism. Kinins are also known to stimulate synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide (EDRF/NO) and prostacyclin, both of which have antigrowth effects. To determine whether the effect of ACE inhibitors on neointima formation is due to blockade of angiotensin II synthesis alone and/or inhibition of kinin inactivation, we followed two approaches. First, we compared the inhibition of neointima formation induced by the AT1-type angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan with that caused by the ACE inhibitor ramipril. We also studied whether a kinin receptor antagonist, Hoe 140, blocks the effect of two different ACE inhibitors, ramipril and enalapril, on neointima formation. In addition, we studied whether the effect of ramipril is blocked by an NO synthesis inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). Although both ramipril and losartan significantly reduced neointima formation, ramipril had a more marked effect (p < 0.05 for ramipril versus losartan). The kinin antagonist Hoe 140 reduced the inhibitory effect of ramipril and enalapril by 73% and 62%, respectively. The remaining effect of the ACE inhibitors was now similar to that of losartan. Inhibition of neointima formation by ramipril was also blocked by the NO synthesis inhibitor L-NAME.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The degradation of BK in semen was completely abolished by the metalloprotease inhibitors EDTA and o-phenanthroline. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) and phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral metalloendopeptidase (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11), were only partially effective in preventing BK degradation in semen. An additive effect was seen with simultaneous inhibition of both enzymes, resulting in complete abolition of BK degradation. HPLC analysis demonstrated that exogenous BK in semen is cleaved at Gly4-Phe5, Phe5-Ser6 and Pro7-Phe8. These results indicate that NEP and ACE are the main peptidases responsible for rapid BK inactivation in semen. The involvement of other peptidases known to be responsible for BK cleavage in other tissues and body fluids, namely carboxypeptidase N (EC 3.4.12.7), post proline cleaving enzyme (EC 3.4.21.26) and aminopeptidase P (EC 3.4.11.9) was excluded.

The present multicenter double-blind study compared cilazapril 2.5 to 5 mg (n = 26) to atenolol 50 to 100 mg (n = 27) over a period course of eight weeks. Office blood pressures in the morning before medication, ABPM over 24 h and self assessment of the blood pressure in the morning and evening were taken. The aim of the study was to find out if the results of ABPM and self assessment of blood pressure are similar when compared to office blood pressure measurement. After four weeks of therapy both cilazapril and atenolol achieved a significant and comparable reduction of blood pressure, which did not change significantly afterwards. Both medications showed a comparable blood pressure control over 24 h. with a once-a-day regimen. The comparison of the three techniques of blood pressure measurement demonstrates that ABPM results in significantly lower average daily values than office blood pressure measurement and that the self-assessed blood pressure values in most cases lie in-between. Although the diastolic ambulatory daily values were on the average 9 mmHg lower than the corresponding office values, it was not possible for an individual patient to accurately predict the ambulatory value obtained by to his office blood pressure value.

    "143": "Onconase, or P-30, is a protein initially purified from extracts of Rana pipiens oocytes and early embryos based upon its anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. It is a basic single-chain protein with an apparent molecular mass of 12,000 daltons and is homologous to RNase A. In cultured 9L glioma cells, onconase inhibits protein synthesis with an IC50 of about 10(-7) M. The inhibition of protein synthesis correlates with cell death determined by clonogenic assays. 125I-Labeled onconase binds to specific sites on cultured 9L glioma cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data shows that onconase appears to bind to cells with two different affinities, one with a Kd of 6.2 x 10(-8) and another of 2.5 x 10(-7) M. Each cell could bind about 3 x 10(5) molecules of onconase at each of the two affinity sites. The low affinity Kd is similar to the IC50 for onconase toxicity. Onconase also demonstrates a saturability of cytotoxicity at a concentration that would saturate the low affinity binding site. Incubation at 4 degrees C increased the binding of onconase to cells relative to 37 degrees C binding and also increased the sensitivity of cells to onconase toxicity, indicating that receptor binding may be an initial step in cell toxicity. Onconase cytotoxicity can be blocked by metabolic inhibitors, NaN3 and 2-deoxyglucose, and cytotoxicity is potentiated 10-fold by monensin. Ribonuclease activity appears necessary for onconase toxicity because alkylated onconase, which only retains 2% of the ribonuclease activity, was at least 100-fold less potent in inhibiting protein synthesis in cells. Onconase inhibition of protein synthesis in 9L cells coincides with the degradation of cellular 28 S and 18 S rRNA. In contrast to RNase A, onconase is resistant to two RNase inhibitors, placental ribonuclease inhibitor and Inhibit-Ace. Northern hybridization with placental ribonuclease inhibitor cDNA probe indicates that 9L glioma cells contain endogenous placental ribonuclease inhibitor mRNA. Based on these results, we propose that onconase toxicity results from onconase binding to cell surface receptors, internalization to the cell cytosol where it degrades ribosomal RNA, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing cell death.",

Management of these disorders should include an attempt to reduce insulin resistance and certainly not to increase it. For example, when possible, thiazide diuretics and beta blockers should be avoided for treating hypertension, because they increase insulin resistance and, in diabetic patients, adversely affect glycemic control.

The ACE inhibitors are suggested to reduce ethanol intake by increasing ANG II synthesis in the brain. The present results show that several different methods can produce opposite effects of ANG II and the ACE inhibitor captopril on ethanol intake. Continuous intraventricular infusions of ANG II for 7 days or low doses of oral or SC-infused captopril for up to 12 days increased the intake of ethanol. The only reduction of ethanol intake resulted from a universal blockade of all ACE in both the brain and periphery, a condition in which ANG II could not possibly mediate the decrease. The results contradict the hypothesis that ethanol intake is suppressed by centrally acting or centrally synthesized ANG II. ACE inhibitors may reduce ethanol intake only when they affect the brain as well as the periphery.",

Furthermore, recent experimental and limited clinical trials strongly indicate a role for ACE inhibitors in limiting myocardial ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. Although the sulphydryl group (SH)-containing ACE inhibitor captopril has been extensively used for most studies, the cardioprotective role of non-SH-containing ACE inhibitors, particularly ramipril and enalapril, recently has been identified. ACE inhibitors reportedly limit infarct size, prevent ventricular remodelling and, more importantly, stabilize the electrical activity of the reperfused heart and prevent the occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias. Preliminary clinical trials indicate an antianginal role for ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibition has also been reported to improve left ventricular performance in patients with long standing infarcts and ischemic failure. Although pharmacological effects of ACE inhibitors are well known, the mechanism of cardioprotection at the molecular and cellular levels is elusive.

Once this action was established, its specificity was determined. Mammary arterial sections were obtained from lactating cattle at slaughter. Vessel sections were placed in a gravity-fed, closed, perfusion apparatus, and flow was measured by a transit-time flow sensor mounted in-line. Treatments were administered by injection into a leurlock port located proximal to the sensor. Angiotensins I, II, and III induced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction of arterial segments at concentrations of 5 x 10(-10) to 5 x 10(-6) M.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril (5 x 10(-8) M), inhibited angiotensin I vasoconstriction, thereby showing that the vasoconstriction by angiotensin I was mediated through its conversion to angiotensin II. These data demonstrated that the mammary artery of lactating cows is responsive to the angiotensin family. Furthermore, mammary arteries contain angiotensin-converting enzyme and specific receptors for angiotensin II. This system may be important in the normal physiological regulation of mammary gland blood flow of lactating cows.",

Borderline or mildly hypertensive patients with normal renal function [group 1, creatinine clearance (CLCR) > 70 ml/min (4.2 L/h), n = 12], moderate renal impairment [group 2, CLCR 30 to 70 ml/min (1.8 to 4.2 L/h), n = 12] or severe renal impairment [group 3, CLCR < 30 ml/min (1.8 L/h), n = 12] received a single oral dose of either temocapril 1 mg (n = 6, each group) or enalapril 5mg (n = 6, each group). These 2 drugs gave similar values for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of the active diacids. The maximum plasma concentration of enalapril diacid was increased 2- and 6-fold in moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, whereas that of temocapril diacid was not altered. The AUC of enalapril diacid increased 13-fold at CLCR values < 30 ml/min, but that of temocapril diacid increased only 2-fold. The duration of plasma ACE inhibition due to enalapril was greatly prolonged by the impairment of renal function, whereas that due to temocapril was affected very little. Urinary recovery of temocapril diacid was decreased markedly in patients with severe renal dysfunction, most probably because the diacid was excreted through the biliary route. On the other hand, urinary recovery of enalapril diacid remained fairly high even in patients with severe renal impairment, because of extremely high plasma diacid concentrations resulting from the lack of biliary excretion. These observations suggest that temocapril is beneficial in the treatment of hypertension in patients with severely impaired renal function.", 
    "161": "Several large, carefully randomized studies of pharmaceutical agents in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and left ventricular dysfunction have demonstrated conclusively that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality among patients with CHF, as well as the number of hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI), and angina. ACE inhibitors also have been shown to prevent the development of heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors and the beta agonists have been shown to increase mortality with no beneficial effect on morbidity. The role of digitalis remains controversial. On the one hand, the limited data available suggest that digoxin prevents clinical deterioration in patients with heart failure, even in the presence of sinus rhythm. On the other hand, when administered after MI, digoxin has been associated with increased mortality. Such conclusions are unreliable, however, since it is impossible to adjust statistically for the fact that digoxin is used in sicker patients. This question will be addressed in a large randomized study currently being conducted by the Digitalis Investigation Group. Pharmacologic approaches to the reduction of sudden death currently being explored include amiodarone, oral magnesium supplements, and beta blockers.

    "162": "Two myocardial processes are initiated by acute myocardial infarction: hypertrophy of residual myocardium and a change in left ventricular chamber dimension. The sequence of these events appears to be critically dependent on the size of the infarct and its distensibility, on the load placed on the myocardium, on the metabolic state of adjacent and remote myocardium, and on the degree of activation of tissue hormone systems. Hypertrophy may occur transversely (concentric) or longitudinally (eccentric). The chamber may enlarge because of cell lengthening or slippage or because of infarct expansion. An increase in radius of curvature intensifies wall stress and metabolic demands, whereas increased wall thickness moderates stress. In a canine experimental model of acute regional myocardial necrosis, hypertrophy and dilatation appear to have a different time course, and both may be attenuated by pharmacologic intervention with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a nitrate. The relative contributions of load reduction, hormone inhibition, and the metabolic effect of pharmacologic intervention need further study. Targeting therapy to the prevention of detrimental ventricular remodeling may be a rational approach but one that needs clinical confirmation.", 
    "163": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, especially among the elderly. Although an underlying disturbance in cardiac function can be identified in most patients, manifestations of the disease are greatly influenced by other factors, particularly neurohumoral and peripheral adaptive responses which occur secondary to impaired cardiac function. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is integrally involved in the pathophysiology of CHF. Originally considered a humoral system, the RAS is now known to exist and operate within cardiac and vascular tissues. The importance of tissue-specific renin-angiotensin systems in CHF is presently under investigation. Most patients with symptomatic CHF benefit from the administration of an ACE inhibitor. Certain asymptomatic patients, such as those with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and those who are at high risk for LV remodeling after anterior wall myocardial infarction, may also benefit from ACE inhibitor therapy. Diuretics and nitrates improve symptoms and often cardiac output in many patients with CHF. Although many new inotropic agents have been tested in CHF patients, none appear clinically superior to digitalis glycosides. The efficacy of digitalis glycosides in CHF may in part result from sympathoinhibitory properties such as the activation of baroreceptor mechanisms. Despite the fact that many CHF patients die from arrhythmias, treatment of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in these patients is not recommended. Patients with symptomatic or sustained ventricular arrhythmias are best treated by a physician experienced in cardiac electrophysiology. Therapy with beta-blocking drugs for CHF patients is controversial. Anticoagulants are recommended for selected patients with CHF. Finally, exercise therapy may improve functional capacity in some patients with CHF through its effects on peripheral blood vessels and skeletal muscle tissues.",

    "165": "A MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 to 1991 was made using the key words \"left ventricular hypertrophy,\" \"hypertension,\" \"insulin resistance,\" and \"cholesterol.\" The bibliographies of these articles and articles previously abstracted in The Family Practice Newsletter (InforMed) and the author's personal files were also sources of information.", 
    "166": "Newer pharmacologic agents for hypertension, the peripheral alpha-blockers, the calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, exert positive effects on left ventricular hypertrophy, serum lipids, and serum insulin and could be cardioprotective. These drugs offer the promise of being able to show cardiovascular benefits from the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension that were not realized in the earlier clinical trials.", 
    "167": "A system is described for the continuous measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and motor activity by telemetry in conscious marmosets freely moving in their home cages. Consistent diurnal variations in these parameters were observed under standard conditions, although these parameters were sensitive to changes in the environment. Blood pressure values were similar to those measured by nontelemetric methods in conscious, restrained marmosets. However, heart rate was lower, indicating that telemetry is less stressful. The suitability of this system for assessing the effects of blood pressure-lowering drugs was evaluated. An acute or a prolonged treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor of marmosets maintained on a low-sodium diet induced a fall in blood pressure as previously observed using nontelemetric methods. With telemetry, however, more accurate information on the duration of response and the effects of the treatment on the diurnal rhythms was obtained. These observations demonstrate the advantages of telemetry for evaluating the hemodynamic effects of drug treatments under physiological conditions.", 
    "168": "The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of prolonged (1 and 5 wk) unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) on the intrarenal renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems in the rat. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and plasma angiotensin (ANG) II levels were significantly higher at 1 and 5 wk of obstruction than in sham-operated groups. Also, plasma renin activity and ANG I levels were elevated at 1 wk (P < 0.05), and plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-kininase II activity was elevated at 5 wk (P < 0.05). Blockade of ANG II receptors with losartan (Dup 753) prevented the rise in SBP after UUO and normalized SBP in chronically hypertensive UUO rats. Renin mRNA levels and ANG II content were elevated in the obstructed kidneys at 1 and 5 wk compared with sham-operated kidneys (P < 0.05). ACE-kininase II activity was elevated in both the obstructed and contralateral kidneys at 5 wk compared with sham-operated kidneys (P < 0.05). In marked contrast to renin, total immunoreactive kallikrein contents and tissue kallikrein mRNA levels in the obstructed kidneys were reduced to 25% of sham-operated kidneys both at 1 and 5 wk (P < 0.001). The results indicate that urinary obstruction activates renin and suppresses kallikrein gene expression. Activation of ACE-kininase II by UUO also serves to enhance intrarenal ANG II generation and kinin degradation. The results implicate ANG II overproduction and kinin deficiency in the pathogenesis of UUO-induced hypertension and intrarenal vasoconstriction.", 
    "169": "The SH-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors zofenopril and captopril have been shown to protect the ischemic myocardium independently of ACE inhibition. Zofenopril (30-100 microM) enhanced reperfusion contractile function and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release. The cardioprotective activity of zofenopril was stereoselective in isolated globally ischemic rat hearts (S, S,R stereoisomer of zofenopril was inactive). The role of ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) activation was investigated using two structurally different KATP blockers, 1 microM glyburide and 100 microM sodium 5-hydroxydecanoate. The cardioprotective activity of 100 microM zofenopril was abolished by both KATP blockers. Cardioprotection with the SH-containing compound n-acetyl cysteine (300 microM) was also reversed by glyburide, further demonstrating that ACE inhibition is not a prerequisite. Isobolographic analysis demonstrated that cotreatment with zofenopril and the KATP opener cromakalim resulted in a super-additive response in the ischemic myocardium. KB analysis demonstrated glyburide was a noncompetitive antagonist in the presence of zofenopril and a competitive antagonist in the presence of cromakalim. Zofenopril has been reported to cause relaxation in aortic smooth muscle rings via an endothelium-dependent component. This relaxation was shifted to the right by both glyburide and sodium 5-hydroxydecanoate. Isobolographic analysis of zofenopril and cromakalim in smooth muscle also demonstrated a super-additive response. These results demonstrate for the first time a link between the cardioprotective effects of the SH-containing compounds zofenopril and n-acetyl cysteine and the KATP. The activity appears to be a receptor-mediated event which occurs in a manner different from classical KATP openers such as cromakalim.", 
    "170": "The potential role of blood pressure and antihypertensive treatment on the progression of advanced chronic renal failure was analyzed in 223 adult patients (126 males) with well-defined primary chronic renal diseases (glomerulonephritis, n = 73; angionephrosclerosis, n = 24; interstitial nephritis, n = 61; polycystic kidney disease, n = 52, Alport's syndrome, n = 13). Effect of average mean arterial pressure (MAP) obtained during follow-up, antihypertensive treatment (normotensive, conventional antihypertensive treatment, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI]), gender, type of the nephropathy, age, body mass index, and protein intake were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance. Mean arterial pressure was significantly and independently correlated with duration (r = -0.40, P < 0.0001) and slope of creatinine clearance (delta Ccr; r = 0.32, P < 0.0001). Mean arterial pressure and antihypertensive treatment could predict 25% of the variation in duration. Gender, type of the nephropathy, and MAP were able to predict 30% of the variation in delta Ccr. When analyzing results by type of nephropathy, MAP was significantly and inversely correlated with duration in glomerulonephritis (r = 0.29, P < 0.05), and positively with delta Ccr in angionephrosclerosis and interstitial nephritis (r = 0.49, P < 0.05 and r = 0.36, P < 0.01, respectively). In each type of nephropathy, conventional antihypertensive treatment and ACEI had grossly similar effects upon duration and slope except. In conclusion, blood pressure level is an important contributor to progression of chronic renal failure but its effect was more evident in angionephrosclerosis and interstitial nephritis at the extreme values of blood pressure distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "171": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of endogenous angiotensin II in mediating the renovascular effects of renal adrenergic stimulation. Six conscious dogs instrumented for monitoring of renal blood flow were subjected to step increases every 10 minutes in the rate of norepinephrine infusion into the renal artery. Under control conditions, infusion of norepinephrine (10-40 ng/min per milliliter per minute of control renal blood flow) increased plasma renin activity and decreased renal blood flow progressively by approximately 10-75%. When increments in angiotensin II during norepinephrine infusion were abolished by fixing plasma levels of angiotensin II at either normal or high concentrations by chronic infusion of captopril plus angiotensin II, renal blood flow responses to adrenergic stimulation were greatly attenuated at rates of norepinephrine infusion that decreased renal blood flow up to approximately 40% under control conditions. Thus, acutely generated angiotensin II appeared to contribute to the renovascular effects of norepinephrine. However, when endogenous levels of angiotensin II were suppressed to low levels by chronic infusion of captopril alone, norepinephrine induced severe renal ischemia at much lower rates of infusion than occurred when the renin-angiotensin system was intact. Since this enhanced sensitivity to norepinephrine did not occur during chronic captopril infusion when angiotensin II was given simultaneously at rates that restored mean arterial pressure to normotensive levels or higher, low arterial pressure during chronic captopril administration may predispose the kidneys to excessive renal vasoconstriction during renal adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "172": "Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder associated with nephrolithiasis and its attendant complications. Traditional management aimed at increasing urinary cystine solubility using oral alkali, D-penicillamine, or mercaptopropionyglycine is often unsuccessful due to intolerable side effects. Two cystinuric patients intolerant of traditional therapy were treated with captopril for 1 year, resulting in a marked decline in urinary cystine excretion. Neither patient experienced recurrent nephrolithiasis or adverse drug effects. Captopril should be considered an alternative to traditional drug management of cystinuria.",

Each dog had 2 cm segments of autogenous jugular vein interpositioned bilaterally into each of the paired carotid and femoral arteries. Quantitative data on luminal narrowing over time from intimal hyperplasia were compared from calculated Gilman parameters after image analysis of retrieved, histologically processed graft sections.",

At 1 week after operation the mean Gilman parameters did not differ significantly among the treatment groups in either midgraft or distal graft segments. At 3 weeks the mean Gilman parameters of midgraft and distal graft sections of cyclosporine-treated dogs differed significantly (p < 0.05) from those of the control group and the cilazapril and aspirin-treated groups, which did not differ from each other. At 6 weeks after operation, mean Gilman parameters from aspirin- and cyclosporine-treated dogs differed statistically from control and cilazapril-medicated dogs and from each other (p < 0.001).",

    "178": "Studies in experimental heart failure have shown that early inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leads to a retardation in the progression of cardiac failure and improves survival. Recently, published data from large controlled trials also indicate that ACE inhibitors prolong survival in patients with mild and moderate heart failure. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibition, even in early phases of the genesis of heart failure, are mainly due to a reduction of the progression of pump failure, whereas the incidence of sudden cardiac death remains unchanged.", 
    "179": "It can be concluded from these data that ACE inhibitors are no longer an add-on therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure but are clearly indicated for the treatment of symptomatic patients with mild heart failure as a first-line therapy.", 
    "180": "The discovery of new properties of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in addition to their well-known ability to lower blood-pressure, such as antiproliferative actions and antiadrenergic and vagal-stimulating effects, has contributed to the usefulness of this class of agents in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "181": "The contribution of an activated endocrine and/or cardiac paracrine renin-angiotensin system to the progression of cardiovascular diseases with the exception of renovascular hypertension is not fully understood. In particular, the following questions were addressed: 1) Is the facilitation of noradrenaline release in the genesis of arrhythmias a target for ACE inhibition? 2) Is an impaired nutritional cardiac blood flow in heart failure a target for ACE inhibition? 3) Is the intimal hyperplasia that results from coronary angioplasty a target for ACE inhibition? 4) Is the diastolic dysfunction associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension a target for ACE inhibition? In an isolated rat heart preparation with ischemia-induced arrhythmias, none of the ACE inhibitors nor an angiotensin II antagonist was able to significantly suppress the incidence or severity of arrhythmias. In 12 patients with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV heart failure, a fall in cardiac filing pressures after ACE inhibition was associated with an immediate rise in cardiac output and an increase in coronary blood flow of almost 30%. In 24 patients with angina at rest, a preceding percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and a second angioplasty, control angiograms at 6 months revealed a high degree of restenosis in both ACE inhibitor-treated and placebo patients. Luminal narrowing amounted to 72% in the placebo group and 61% in the ACE inhibitor group. The differences between placebo and enalapril were statistically not significant. In 12 patients with essential hypertension treated with 5 mg cilazapril, left ventricular mass was reduced by 30%, which was closely related to the change in mean arterial blood pressure. The concomitant normalization of the diastolic filling pattern by ACE inhibition, however, was not related to the respective changes in blood pressure.", 
    "182": "Promising experimental data regarding the antiproliferative effects of ACE inhibitors in preventing restenosis could not be transferred into clinical benefits for patients who underwent repeat coronary angioplasty. Possible antiarrhythmic effects of ACE inhibitors are not likely to be caused by their suppression of noradrenaline release during myocardial ischemia. ACE inhibition was effective in reducing coronary resistance in patients with severe heart failure, thereby augmenting nutritional cardiac blood flow. ACE inhibition also effectively induced a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension. The associated normalization of diastolic filling pattern may represent an important goal in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "183": "In this article the clinical experiences with the new non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril are reviewed. The drug lowers blood pressure effectively in patients with mild-to-severe hypertension including elderly and obese patients. Distinguishing features of the compound are its long plasma half-life and high degree of lipophilicity.", 
    "184": "Baseline echocardiography was performed on 25 patients with essential hypertension and a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 114 mm Hg while receiving placebo. Once-daily trandolapril was then titrated from 1 to 4 mg. After 3 months of therapy, supine diastolic blood pressure decreased by 7.5% (p < 0.0001). Left ventricular hypertrophy regressed as evidenced by a 23.2% (p < 0.0001) decrease in left ventricular mass index at 3 months and a 12.4% (p < 0.05) reduction of relative wall thickness at 6 months. Although afterload decreased by 12.4% (p < 0.05) at 3 months, left ventricular systolic function remained unchanged, whereas left ventricular contractility, which was assessed from the load-independent relationship of end-systolic wall stress to velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, improved. Left ventricular diastolic function (E/A ratio) improved in 15 of 25 patients with low baseline values from 0.96 +/- 0.14 to 1.18 +/- 0.25 (mean +/- SD, p < 0.0002) at 3 months. We conclude that trandolapril effectively reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and improves diastolic function in patients with hypertension while systolic function is preserved.", 
    "185": "Trandolapril is a newly developed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is rapidly hydrolyzed mainly in the liver to its biologically active metabolite trandolaprilat. The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of trandolaprilat is about 6 hours; the effective plasma half-life of accumulation at steady state is 24 hours. The active metabolite trandolaprilat has very high lipophilicity in comparison with other ACE inhibitors, which should contribute to an improved tissue penetration of the substance. The very high affinity of trandolaprilat to the ACE and the corresponding low dissociation rate are probably the two main reasons for the prolonged duration of action. The high potency of trandolaprilat in ACE inhibition is reflected by its low IC50 (concentration needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity). With repeated once-daily administration of trandolapril, plasma ACE activity was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion, but increasing the dose beyond 2 mg did not further reduce angiotensin II levels, apparently because of the compensatory increase in plasma renin levels. Therefore trandolapril in a dose of 2 mg once a day reduces blood pressure consistently throughout the 24 hour-period after intake. Because of its particularly long half-life, trandolapril, probably more than any other drug of its class, can be considered a true, once-a-day antihypertensive drug.", 
    "186": "Hypertension is the major determinant of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. In type I diabetes hypertension develops in parallel with the evolution of nephropathy, whereas in type II diabetes hypertension precedes the onset of manifest diabetes mellitus by years or decades. Nephropathy is equally common in types I and II diabetes. Strong genetic determinants for nephropathy have been recognized, but it is unclear whether a genetic predisposition to hypertension and elevated sodium-lithium countertransport are involved. In epidemiologic studies hypertension is related to the risk and rate of evolution of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular complications. The relationship appears to be causal, because antihypertensive treatment attenuates the rate of loss of glomerular filtration. In this respect angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be superior (renal protective action). Calcium channel blockers have been promising in experimental studies, but clinical information is currently incomplete.", 
    "187": "The pathogenesis of hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) involves an interplay of hereditary and acquired mechanisms. A familial trait for essential hypertension appears to be a risk factor for the development of both hypertension and nephropathy in type I DM and coexists commonly with impaired insulin sensitivity, relative hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia, which can already be detected before the appearance of hypertension, obesity, or upper abdominal redistribution of body fat. The latter finding helps explain the frequent development of hypertension as well as dyslipidemia and/or type II DM in given individuals. Obesity is an important factor promoting these complications. Type I or II DM but not uncomplicated essential hypertension is characteristically accompanied by excess body Na+. This abnormality complements a tendency toward vascular hyperreactivity and a presumably morphologic and functional vasculopathy, thereby promoting the pathogenesis of hypertension in diabetic patients. For the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients, nonpharmacologic measures are indispensable. If drugs are needed, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and some but not all calcium antagonists are the preferred agents. Monotherapy or a combination of these drug types allows effective blood pressure control in most diabetic patients without further metabolic impairment; ACE inhibitors even tend to improve glucose control. Ketanserin may be a potential alternative, and if a diuretic is also needed, the metabolically neutral indapamide is a reasonable choice. If these agents do not allow satisfactory blood pressure highly selective beta 1-blockers or alpha 1-blockers may be introduced as a second choice. In diabetic patients with nephropathy, effective antihypertensive therapy can reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of the nephropathy; ACE inhibitors may improve diabetic proteinuria even at unchanged systemic blood pressure levels. Unless diuretics are needed for reasons other than hypertension, the treatment of diabetic patients with thiazides or loop diuretics in conventional dosage should probably be avoided until clarification of their influence on prognosis. Nevertheless, whether and to what extent other agents and nonpharmacologic measures can modify the prognosis in diabetic patients is also unclear, and the approach to antihypertensive therapy is therefore still largely empiric.", 
    "188": "We sought to characterize the reflex counterregulatory responses throughout a 6-day period of continuous nitroglycerin therapy and to examine the effect of concurrent administration of a non-thiol angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (benazepril) on the nature of those responses.",

Using a double-blind randomized parallel design, 11 subjects received placebo and 9 received benazepril. Hemodynamic responses to sublingual nitroglycerin administration were evaluated before and after sustained therapy with transdermal nitroglycerin.", 
    "191": "Attenuation of the hypotensive response to transdermal nitroglycerin was rapid in the group receiving placebo and the group receiving benazepril. There were no significant hormonal responses to transdermal nitroglycerin in either group, and sodium retention was modest and transient. Hematocrit levels decreased after transdermal nitroglycerin therapy and remained depressed for the duration of nitroglycerin therapy, a finding that suggests plasma volume expansion. Blood pressure responses to sublingual nitroglycerin in both groups were similar before and after continuous transdermal nitroglycerin therapy.", 
    "192": "These data suggest that plasma volume expansion plays a more important role than neurohormonal responses in the loss of nitrate effects during sustained therapy. That therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor did not modify the hemodynamic responses to continuous nitroglycerin therapy supports this conclusion. Further investigation will be necessary to confirm whether therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has any role in the prevention of nitrate tolerance.",

    "194": "1. Trandolaprilat was found to inhibit angiotensin I (Ang I)-induced contraction of the rat thoracic aorta, and to augment bradykinin(BK)-induced contraction of the guinea pig ileum. In inhibitory activity (IC50) on the Ang I induced contraction of the rat thoracic aorta, trandolaprilat was about 2.4 times as potent as enalaprilat. Concerning the augmenting activity (AC50) on bradykinin-induced contraction of the guinea pig ileum, the activity of trandolaprilat was similar to that of enalaprilat. 2. Trandolaprilat had no effect on contractions induced by norepinephrine, PGF2 alpha, 5-HT or CaCl2 in the thoracic aorta of rats. 3. Trandolaprilat produced endothelium-dependent relaxation. This relaxation was inhibited by NG-methyl-L-arginine treatment, suggesting that endothelium-dependent relaxation of trandolaprilat is related to endothelium-derived-relaxation-factor(EDRF/NO). Like trandolaprilat, captopril also produced endothelium-dependent relaxation, whereas enalaprilat had no effect.", 
    "195": "Two different analytical techniques were used to measure angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and three different methods were used to measure each of the ACE inhibitors enalaprilat and benazeprilat. All measurements were made in human plasma. The groups of methods were compared by two different statistical approaches. First, the means of the methods were compared by the paired t test or analysis of variance, depending on whether two or three different methods were under comparison. Second, the squared coefficients of variation of the methods were compared by the Jackknife technique. The dual statistical approach employed enabled both the accuracy and the variability of the analytical methods to be compared and is a superior approach to the inappropriate use of correlation coefficients that are commonly used to compare analytical techniques. No statistically significant difference was found between the two assays used to measure ACE activity. Differences were found between the three methods to measure enalaprilat, although no obvious reason could be found for this phenomenon. Significant differences were also found between the three methods used to measure benazeprilat and were attributed to the presence of metabolites interfering in the nonspecific assay methods.", 
    "196": "The presence of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 was demonstrated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by immunostaining. Enzymatic activity of neutral endopeptidase was determined as 0.167 +/- 0.02 mU/mg protein in the membrane fraction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, using the fluorogenic peptide substrate, dansyl-D-Ala-Gly-Phe(pNO2)-Gly. No activity was found in the cytosolic fraction of endothelial cells. The role of this peptidase in the degradation of the endogenous vasodilator bradykinin was investigated by incubating human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers with bradykinin (10(-8) mol/l). The inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase, phosphoramidon (10(-8) mol/l), decreased the degradation of bradykinin in the supernatant of endothelial cells; the half-life of bradykinin was then increased from 29 +/- 1 to 46 +/- 2 minutes. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (10(-8) mol/l), increased the half-life of bradykinin to 244 +/- 20 minutes; the combination of both inhibitors increased the half-life of bradykinin to 381 +/- 51 minutes. Inhibitors of aminopeptidase (amastatin) and carboxypeptidase (2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl-thiopropionic acid) caused no significant effect. The effect of phosphoramidon was small in comparison with that of lisinopril, but was pronounced in combination with lisinopril. Neutral endopeptidase activity is localized in the membranes of human endothelial cells and seems to be involved in the degradation of bradykinin by the vascular endothelium, particularly during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "197": "We used Evans blue dye to assess the effects of bradykinin on vascular extravasation in nasal mucosa of pathogen-free F344 rats. There was a dose-dependent increase in Evans blue extravasation when bradykinin was delivered by topical instillation in the nose (doses, 25-100 nmol). Only the highest intravenous doses (2 and 5 mumol/kg) of bradykinin caused increased extravasation. When bradykinin was delivered by either route, its effect on extravasation was exaggerated by pharmacological inhibition of the enzymes neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and kininase II [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)]. When bradykinin was instilled locally, the effect of NEP inhibition was predominant; when bradykinin was injected intravenously, the effect of ACE inhibition was predominant. The mechanism of extravasation also varied with the mode of bradykinin delivery: when bradykinin was instilled locally in the nose, the selective neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist CP-96,345 markedly inhibited the response, whereas it had no effect on Evans blue extravasation when bradykinin was injected intravenously. We conclude that bradykinin causes dose-related increases in Evans blue dye extravasation in the nose and that these effects are exaggerated when NEP and ACE are inhibited. Topically instilled bradykinin causes vascular extravasation to a large extent via NK1 receptor stimulation, thus suggesting a major role for tachykinins released from sensory nerve endings.", 
    "198": "Degradation of the behaviorally active peptide ACTH/MSH(4-10) and its synthetic analog semax was studied in serum in the presence of several specific peptidase inhibitors. Bestatin and puromycin were used to inhibit aminopeptidase activity, lisinopril for angiotensin-converting enzyme, phosphoramidon for neutral endopeptidase 24.11, and Z-Pro-prolinal for prolyl endopeptidase. Bestatin inhibited up to 66%, puromycin about 33%, and lisinopril about 15% of total degrading activity against both ACTH/MSH(4-10) and semax. Involvement of neutral endopeptidase and prolyl endopeptidase in hydrolysis of the two peptides was less definitive. These studies showed that aminopeptidases and angiotensin-converting enzyme are responsible for the major part of the hydrolysis of ACTH/MSH(4-10) and semax in rat serum.", 
    "199": "1. The acute effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalaprilat, on baroreflex-mediated changes in renal and total NA spillover rate in conscious rabbits with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathic congestive heart failure (CHF) were investigated under resting conditions and in response to changes in arterial pressure induced by sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine infusions. 2. Six saline-treated (N group) and 11 doxorubicin-treated rabbits (1 mg/kg administered i.v. twice weekly) were studied after 4 and 6 weeks treatment. Five CHF rabbits received saline (C group) and six enalaprilat infusion (ACEI group). 3. After 4 weeks of doxorubicin, mean arterial pressure (MAP)-renal noradrenaline (NA) spillover and MAP-total NA spillover curves did not change during enalaprilat infusion. 4. After 6 weeks, the C group showed blunted MAP-renal NA spillover and MAP-total NA spillover curves. In the ACEI group, however, both curves returned toward those seen in the N group (slope of MAP-renal NA curve: from 0.27 to 1.80 ng/min per mmHg, MAP-total NA curve: from 1.61 to 3.59 ng/min per mmHg). 5. Results of this study indicate that enalaprilat enhances baroreflex control of renal and total NA spillover in rabbits with CHF and further support the view that activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes significantly to the attenuated baroreflex responses in CHF.", 
    "200": "1. To investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) on exercise performance, the following were measured in eight normal rabbits performing graded treadmill exercise during intravenous vehicle saline or enalaprilat infusion: haemodynamics, noradrenaline (NA) spillover, hindlimb oxygen consumption and lactate release. 2. Blood pressure, heart rate (HR), femoral blood flow (FBF), hindlimb lactate release, hindlimb oxygen consumption and hindlimb NA spillover rate were all significantly increased during exercise and the changes during enalaprilat infusion were similar to control responses. 3. At submaximal exercise (6 m/min), ACEI did not significantly alter the responses of hindlimb lactate release, NA spillover rate or oxygen consumption. At the higher exercise load (12 m/min), ACEI reduced hindlimb NA spillover rate (33.1 +/- 4.2 vs 61.3 +/- 17.1 ng/min) and significantly increased oxygen consumption (241 +/- 53.4 vs 133 +/- 23.3%, P < 0.05). The ratio of hindlimb NA spillover rate to total NA spillover rate was markedly increased during exercise, with similar changes being observed in ACEI and control experiments. 4. This study indicates that acute ACEI has a favourable effect on oxygen utilization in exercising muscle in the normal rabbit. Suppression of local sympathetic activation during exercising stress, as reflected in a reduced NA spillover response, may benefit the microcirculation in exercising muscles.", 
    "201": "Because neutrophils might be involved in some of the therapeutic effects of captopril we studied the effect of captopril on neutrophil migration. Captopril strongly enhances migration by rabbit peritoneal neutrophils. Stimulation by captopril was maximal at a concentration of about 400 microM; at higher concentrations stimulation decreased again. The stimulatory effect is partly chemokinetic, and partly chemotactic. Captopril disulfide also stimulates migration, though the stimulating effect is less than that of captopril. Captopril-induced stimulation of migration was strongly inhibited by pretreatment of neutrophils with pertussis toxin, indicating that the stimulation is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Intact sulfhydryl groups on the cell surface are required for stimulation because inactivation of these groups with the non-penetrating sulfhydryl reagent 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) completely abolishes the stimulating effect of captopril and of captopril disulfide. Both captopril and captopril disulfide cause an enhancement of cyclic GMP level in the neutrophil. The enhancement of both the cGMP level and that of migration is blocked by methylene blue and by LY-83583, suggesting that the stimulating effect of captopril is mediated by cGMP. Inhibitors of NO generation, such as NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, NG-nitro-L-arginine and canavanine have no effect on captopril-induced stimulation of migration, indicating that NO is not involved in the stimulating effect of captopril.",

Haematocrit plasma viscosity and blood filterability were not altered by either drug. Hydrochlorothiazide tended to increase and lisinopril tended to decrease whole blood viscosity at all shear rates but these changes did not reach statistical significance. Lisinopril increased the erythrocyte aggregation time (from 1.98 +/- 0.50 to 2.08 +/- 0.52 s) and decreased the disaggregation shear rate (from 159 +/- 46 to 153 +/- 40 s-1) and the disaggregation shear stress (from 705 +/- 257 to 659 +/- 204 mPa). Hydrochlorothiazide induced the opposite effects (2.00 +/- 0.47 to 1.92 +/- 0.39 s, 181 +/- 531 to 196 +/- 82 s-1 and 813 +/- 268 to 868 +/- 392 mPa, respectively) with a statistically significant (P < 0.05) intergroup difference.",

    "212": "Young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), stroke-prone hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated chronically with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril in different regimens in order to produce a wide-ranging combination of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy.", 
    "213": "All strains were treated with perindopril (0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg per day) in their drinking water from 4 until 9 weeks of age. Additional groups of SHR were treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg per day) from 4 until 12 weeks and from 4 until 14 weeks of age. At 13 weeks of age all animals were chronically instrumented with arterial and venous catheters. One week later, steady-state sigmoidal mean arterial pressure-heart rate reflex curves were obtained in the conscious rats by the injection of pressor and depressor agents before and after the administration of atenolol (1 mg/kg, intravenously) to determine the vagal component. The minimum and the maximum blood pressure produced by nitroprusside and methoxamine, respectively, after simultaneous ganglion and beta-adrenoceptor blockade were used as an index of whole body vascular hypertrophy. The left ventricular to body weight ratio was measured at the end of the experiment.", 
    "214": "At 14 weeks of age, mean arterial pressure, the maximum and minimum autonomically blocked blood pressure and the left ventricular to body weight ratio were 34, 20, 9 and 17% higher, respectively, in SHR, and 56, 35, 27 and 39% higher, respectively, in SHRSP than in WKY rats. Perindopril treatment dose-dependently reduced both cardiac and vascular hypertrophy but to different extents. The highest doses reduced mean arterial pressure and the autonomically blocked maximum and minimum blood pressure in both hypertensive strains to the levels of untreated WKY rats but approximately 50% of the cardiac hypertrophy was still present. The left ventricular to body weight ratio was normalized in SHR only with the longer term perindopril treatments. A comparison of the baroreflex function curves in untreated SHR and SHRSP showed that the vagal component of the heart rate range was markedly reduced compared to that in WKY rats. Treated SHRSP had a normal mean arterial pressure and a normal autonomically blocked maximum and minimum blood pressure, but their vagal heart rate range was only 63% of that in WKY rats. The heart rate range in SHR treated from 4 to 9 weeks of age was only marginally greater than that of untreated SHR, despite prevention of hypertension and vascular hypertrophy. In SHR treated from 4 until 12 weeks of age, which prevented cardiac hypertrophy, the vagal heart rate range was markedly greater. With perindopril from the age of 4 to 14 weeks, the vagal baroreflex heart rate range was similar to that of WKY rats. Thus the improvement in the vagal heart rate range was more closely related to the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy (r = 0.73, P < 0.001) than vascular hypertrophy or a blood pressure elevation. Since there were no further changes in the indices of hypertrophy, the presence of the ACE inhibitor was likely to have been responsible for restoring the remaining 35% of the vagal baroreflex not affected by structural factors.", 
    "215": "These results suggest that prevention of cardiac rather than vascular hypertrophy is the major requirement for normalizing the vagal component of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex in hypertensive rats. However, structural changes accounted for only about two-thirds of the vagal deficit. The remainder was restored by the presence of an ACE inhibitor, suggesting that the vagal component of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex is normally suppressed by the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "216": "It has been proposed that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) may play a role in the metabolism of the vasodilator peptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Reduced metabolism following treatment with ACE inhibitors may cause accumulation of VIP which in turn may mediate some of the beneficial haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibition observed in patients with heart failure. This study has shown that inhibition of local vascular ACE does not interfere with the vascular effects of VIP on forearm resistance vessels when this peptide is infused into the brachial artery of normal volunteers. These results suggest that endothelial ACE plays little part in the metabolism of intravascular VIP.", 
    "217": "The degradation of bradykinin by angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) activity in cultured human endothelial cells was studied by direct measurement of bradykinin and by its effect on the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors. The half-life of exogenous bradykinin (10,000 pg/ml) was calculated from the decay of the bradykinin concentration as 46 +/- 2 min in cell monolayers, 133 +/- 15 min in conditioned medium, and 24 +/- 2 min in homogenates. Most of the bradykinin-degrading activity in cell monolayers could be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the ACE inhibitors lisinopril, ramiprilat, and captopril. Bradykinin-degrading activity was released into the culture medium containing one-fourth of the bradykinin-degrading activity found in the presence of cell monolayers. In cell homogenates higher unspecific bradykinin-degrading activities were present. The functional consequence of bradykinin degradation was demonstrated by the potentiating effect of ramiprilat on the generation of endothelium-derived relaxing factors nitric oxide and prostacyclin from endothelial cells. The study supports the concept of increased vasodilatory effects of bradykinin during ACE inhibition.", 
    "218": "It is now established that all of the components necessary for the local formation of angiotensin II (ANG II) coexist in the kidney and can alter local ANG II production rate. However, data on ANG II concentrations in different compartments within the kidney are limited. Recently, proximal tubule fluid ANG II concentrations in the nanomolar range were reported. Using an ANG II radioimmunoassay procedure with enhanced sensitivity, we performed experiments to explore proximal tubular fluid ANG II levels further and to determine the source of the ANG II. Total free-flow proximal tubular fluid samples (n = 11) had an average ANG II concentration of 13 +/- 2 nM. These concentrations were similar (10 +/- 2 nM) in samples collected into pipettes containing the inhibitors enalaprilat and EDTA (n = 17). Fluid collected from blocked proximal tubules that were perfused with artificial tubular fluid showed similar ANG II concentrations both in the presence (22 +/- 3 nM) and absence (22 +/- 4 nM) of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, in the perfusate. Plasma ANG II concentrations were much lower and averaged 155 +/- 26 pM. Isotonic saline expansion lowered plasma ANG II levels to 30 +/- 5 pM (P < 0.01) but did not significantly decrease intraluminal ANG II (8 +/- 1 nM). These data provide further evidence that intratubular ANG II concentrations are in the nanomolar range and are regulated independently of the plasma ANG II levels. The data obtained from perfused tubules indicate that the proximal tubule adds substantial amounts of ANG II or a precursor into the tubular lumen.", 
    "219": "alpha-Naphthylthiourea (ANTU) when injected intraperitoneally to rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg elicited lung oedema indicated by an increase in lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratio and pleural effusion. The injection of acetylsalicylic acid, which is a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, and BW 755C, a cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor, prior to ANTU produced a significant inhibition in pleural fluid accumulation without changing the LW/BW ratio. BW A4C, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, however, caused a highly significant inhibition in pleural effusion and a slight but significant decrease in LW/BW ratio. Thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor, UK 38485, caused a slight but significant inhibition in pleural fluid accumulation without altering the LW/BW ratio. Iloprost, however, produced a slight but significant inhibition in the LW/BW ratio without reducing the pleural effusion rate. A significant decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the isolated perfused lungs of ANTU-treated rats was noted. This observation was thought to be an evidence of a functional alteration of the lung vascular endothelium. The possible role of eicosanoids in lung oedema induced by ANTU and the related mechanisms of decreased ACE activity are discussed.", 
    "220": "Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels are higher in patients with diabetes mellitus than in many others. Techniques are available to grade different degrees of diabetic retinopathy, which can demonstrate a relationship between ACE and diabetic retinopathy. In this study, patients with diabetic retinopathy had higher serum ACE levels (6.3 +/- 0.2) than nondiabetic patients (4.3 +/- 0.5) (p < 0.001). In addition, the mean serum ACE level in diabetic patients with nonproliferative retinopathy (5.55 +/- 0.4) was less than that in diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy (6.63 +/- 0.25) (p = 0.02). Due to the variability in individual serum ACE levels and the frequent use of ACE inhibitors by hypertensive diabetics, these techniques are not suitable for retinopathy screening programs. However, the graded relationship demonstrated by these data may have relevance for the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "221": "Treatment of kidney transplant recipients with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (iACE) is associated with increased risk of deterioration of renal function. Between 1988-1992 in Transplantation Institute, 71 renal allograft recipients were treated with iACE. 44 of them received iACE in order to reduce proteinuria, 18 due to secondary polycythemia and 9 recipients received iACE because of hypertension resistant to at least 3 hypotensive drugs. Acute renal failure developed in 5 patients and all of them received iACE as treatment of resistant hypertension. After resumption of renal function, in 3 of 5 patients artery stenosis of the transplanted kidney was found. In 1 recipient acute renal failure occurred despite normal renal arteriography and normal indexes of the flow through renal arteries determined by Doppler ultrasound examination. In 2 patients acute renal failure appeared after a single minimal dose of iACE. Severe arterial hypertension in patients with transplanted kidney is a particular risk factor for development of acute renal failure after iACE. The normal arteriography in transplanted kidney and normal arterial blood flow measured by means of Doppler ultrasound do not exclude the possibility of development of acute renal failure after iACE.", 
    "222": "The efficacy and tolerability of an enalapril maleate-hydrochlorothiazide combination (EM-HCTZ) were evaluated in a prospective, open-label study in 26 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean baseline sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure: 153/103 mmHg) requiring two agents to reduce sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) below 90 mmHg. Their mean age was 52 years. Patients received enalapril 5 mg daily, which was increased to 10 mg if SDBP was not reduced to < 90 mmHg during a 5-week titration period following washout. If blood pressure did not reach that goal, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide was added. Only patients who required enalapril 10 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg for control (SDBP < 90 mmHg) at the end of titration received open-label EM-HCTZ as maintenance therapy for 6 weeks. The SDBP of 19 of the 26 patients (73%) who began titration was controlled at the end of titration, and they received maintenance therapy. During maintenance, the mean SDBP decreased from baseline 13.2 mmHg at week 2, 13.3 mmHg at week 4, and 10.1 mmHg at week 6. All changes from baseline were significant. At the end of the maintenance period, SDBP was controlled in 8 (42%) of 19 patients enrolled. One patient was withdrawn from the study because blood pressure was poorly controlled. Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was monitored, average outcome was computed for each patient during the 24-hour interval, and with a paired comparison, baseline and follow-up data were compared with the data measured manually. The mean baseline ABP was 9 mmHg lower than the baseline SDBP measured manually (r = 0.58, P = 0.01). Following treatment with EM-HCTZ, mean diastolic blood pressure fell 10 mmHg and mean systolic blood pressure fell 15 mmHg. In summary, EM-HCTZ was highly effective and generally well-tolerated in a substantial proportion of participants whose SDBP remained > 90 mmHg on enalapril 10 mg. Important differences between blood pressure measured manually and with a monitor were also demonstrated.", 
    "223": "Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been available since the mid-1970s. Widespread use of ABPM in research settings has led to an appreciation of its advantages and disadvantages. ABPM is a valuable research tool because of its ability to evaluate the duration and consistency of action with new antihypertensive agents. It has also been used to exclude patients who have white-coat hypertension from pharmacotherapy. Past and current clinical studies are reviewed to illustrate the role of this technique in the development of a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril. The studies involve administering a single daily dose of ramipril to lower blood pressure and ABPM. Three double-blinded, randomized studies and one placebo-controlled, crossover study are reviewed. In these studies of patients with essential hypertension, once-daily ramipril controlled blood pressure, reduced systolic/diastolic blood pressure throughout a 24-hour period, and did not interfere with normal circadian blood pressure patterns. Lessons learned from research suggest that ABPM will find a niche in clinical practice.", 
    "224": "Endothelium-dependent relaxation in arteries is attenuated in clinical and experimental atherosclerosis. This study investigates the endothelial preservation properties of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, by assessing its ability to restore endothelium-dependent responsiveness in blood vessels from rabbits fed an atherogenic diet (0.25% cholesterol; 3% coconut oil; 12 weeks). Seven rabbits fed the atherogenic diet received ramipril (3 mg/kg mixed into their food daily) and 6 rabbits were maintained on the atherogenic diet alone. Control rabbits (n = 6) were fed a standard diet and did not receive ramipril. At the end of the dietary intervention, the rabbits were killed and blood was collected for measurement of the lipid profile. The thoracic aorta was isolated and half was frozen for pathologic review while the other half was cut into rings and placed in a muscle bath for measurement of isometric force development. Dose response curves to phenylephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) and angiotensin II (10(-10) to 3 x 10(-7) M) were completed. There was a minimal decrease in responsiveness to phenylephrine in vessels from rabbits eating the atherogenic diet compared with controls and no significant differences in the response to angiotensin II for any of the vessels. Following contraction by phenylephrine, acetylcholine (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-10) to 10(-5) M) dose response curves were completed. Relaxation to acetylcholine in aortic rings from control rabbits was observed, although in arteries from atherogenic rabbits relaxation was attenuated. This effect was prevented in the atherogenic rabbits fed ramipril. Responsiveness to the endothelium-independent vasodilator, nitroglycerin, was similar in arteries from the three rabbit groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "225": "Of the main aspects of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and appearance of cardiac dysfunction seem to be the most common and to produce an early and severe cardiac deterioration. Even in the presence of normal systolic function diastolic filling abnormalities are described. The efficacy of many antihypertensive drugs to decrease blood pressure and to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy has already been demonstrated. Cilazapril is a new ACE-inhibitor that in previous studies showed a very important antihypertensive effect. To assess its capacity, in long-term treatment, to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy we performed a prospective study on patients with mild hypertension.", 
    "226": "Nineteen patients (aged 48 +/- 15 years) with mild hypertension (mean arterial pressure automatically recorded for 24 hours with blood pressure ambulatorial monitoring) were treated with cilazapril (5 mg/day) for 1 year. Doppler echocardiography was performed: at the beginning, after 6 months and after one year of therapy. The following parameters were evaluated: interventricular septal and posterior wall thickness, LV end-diastolic diameter, LV mass index, early (E) and late (A) diastolic filling flow velocities and the ratio E/A.",

    "229": "We have established the peptidase content of a P2 fraction (enriched in synaptosomes) and plasma membranes prepared from canine intestinal mucosa. Fourteen exo- and endopeptidases were assayed with fluorimetric or chromogenic substrates and identified by means of specific peptidase inhibitors. Post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV, aminopeptidase M, and carboxypeptidase A were the most abundant exopeptidases, while aminopeptidases A and B, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, pyroglutamyl peptide hydrolase I, and carboxypeptidase B displayed little, if any, activity. Endopeptidase 24.11 was the only endopeptidase that was detected in high amount. By contrast, proline endopeptidase exhibited a low activity, while angiotensin-converting enzyme, endopeptidase 24.15, endopeptidase 24.16, and cathepsin B and D-like activities were not detected. The catabolic rates of the two related neuropeptides, neurotensin (NT) and neuromedin N (NN), established that NN was inactivated 16 to 24 times faster than NT by plasma membrane and P2 fractions, respectively. Furthermore, the two peptides underwent qualitatively distinct mechanisms of degradation. A phosphoramidon-sensitive formation of NT(1-10) was detected as the major NT catabolite, indicating that NT was susceptible to an endoproteolytic cleavage elicited by endopeptidase 24.11. By contrast, NN was inactivated by the action of an exopeptidase at its N-terminus, leading to the formation of [des-Lys1]NN. The occurrence of this NN metabolite was prevented by bestatin and actinonin, but not by the aminopeptidase B inhibitor, arphamenine B, indicating that the release of the N-terminal residue of NN was likely due to aminopeptidase M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "230": "Development of heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction is directly related to the extent of myocardial infarction and complex architectural changes defined as infarct expansion and remodeling. ACE inhibitors are an exciting class of agents that have the potentiality to prevent left ventricular dilatation, evolution of heart failure and death in the acute myocardial infarction setting. Besides, reperfusion is a important intervention that prevents infarct expansion in the early period after myocardial infarction. Early reperfusion limits expansion by infarct size reduction while late reperfusion reduces expansion independent of myocardial salvage by limiting transmural damage and improving the infarct healing. Therefore, reperfusion therapy decreases the incidence of congestive heart failure and significantly improves the prognosis of heart failure. On the other hand, the in-hospital mortality rate of cardiogenic shock, resulting from acute myocardial infarction, remains high, although primary PTCA has apparently resulted in substantial improvement in mortality of myocardial infarction shock. Thus, reperfusion treatment may be more effective in preventing rather than treating cardiogenic shock.", 
    "231": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in conjunction with diuretic agents, have an established role in the management of moderate and severe heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction. ACE inhibitor improves prognosis, symptoms and exercise performance. There have been some promising studies and one of the most widely quoted is the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS I), which demonstrated a 36% reduction in mortality with the ACE inhibitor, enalapril, versus placebo in patients with advanced heart failure. Over the last few years, we have received important information that seems to tell us that ACE inhibitors must be utilized if we hope to reduce mortality. An important topic is study the action of ACE inhibitors in improving prognosis, and the mechanism of the action.", 
    "232": "In congestive heart failure (CHF), a variety of compensatory mechanisms such as activation of sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin, facilitate water and sodium retention and increase circulating blood volume, which primarily improve systemic perfusion. However, hypervolemia sometimes induces pulmonary edema and afterload elevation, resulting in a further decrease in cardiac output. Diuretics are administered in patients with CHF to cut this vicious cycle by reducing blood volume. Evaluation of hemodynamic states is important in patients with severe CHF, since an excessive reduction in preload could critically decrease cardiac output. Among conventional diuretics, loop diuretics is the most potent and widely used for management of CHF. Inhibition of such compensatory mechanisms such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and atrial natriuretic peptide-related agents is shown to exert natriuretic and desirable hemodynamic effects in CHF and is among candidates for future diuretics.", 
    "233": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered to indicate cardiac autonomic reflex activity. The reproducibility of HRV determinations from repeated Holter recordings has not been vigorously evaluated. This represents, however, an important question since HRV determinations are increasingly used to examine disease-related changes in the autonomic tone or the effects of therapeutic interventions. Thus, the present study examined the reproducibility of 4 commonly used time-domain parameters (SDNN, SDANN, rMSSD, pNN50) and the spectral components of HRV in 17 healthy volunteers and in patients with coronary artery disease (n = 9) or hypertensive heart disease (n = 9). In all subjects, 2 Holter recordings were obtained 7 days apart. In both, healthy volunteers and in patients, overall reproducibility of HRV parameters was good exhibiting correlation coefficients between 0.60 and 0.98. However, in individual subjects particularly in those without heart disease a higher degree of variability of HRV measurements was observed. In those patients with markedly reduced HRV, reproducibility was best. It is concluded that repeated HRV determinations may be utilized to examine the effects of underlying disease progress or of therapeutic interventions on cardiac autonomic tone.", 
    "234": "Any treatment used in pregnant women must take into account the effects of the substance in question of the fetus and the particular sensitivity of the latter during the first three months of development. The majority of drugs used in cardiology can be prescribed during pregnancy: digitalis preparations, furosemide, certain beta-blockers, verapamil, nifedipine (except during the first three months), quinidine, disopyramide, lignocaine, flecainide, amiodarone, heparins (non-fragmented and low molecular weight), central antihypertensive agents, dipyridamole and aspirin. In contrast, some drugs should be avoided because of insufficient information regarding their maternal and fetal consequences (bumetamide, modamide, the most recent beta-blockers, cibenzoline, ticlopidine) or because of harmful adverse effects on the fetus (spironolactones, bipyridines, diltiazem) or the newborn infant (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). Finally, with certain medications (propafenone, oral anticoagulants), it is important to be able to compare maternal risks due to the disease and fetal risks induced by the drug. Modification of the conditions of use of these drugs and very careful monitoring of the patient most often suffice to avoid untoward events or complications with potentially serious medicolegal consequences and which may implicate the liability of the prescriber.",

The effect of cilazapril on the structure of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) was evaluated by both stereological and myographic techniques. 4. Cilazapril lowered SBP significantly throughout the treatment period (16 weeks; GH with cilazapril 135 +/- 5 vs GH 216 +/- 9 mmHg, P < 0.001; N cilazapril 91 +/- 6 vs N 137 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.001); intra-arterial BP was also significantly lowered. 5. Bodyweight (BW) of treated GH rats was significantly lower than that of untreated GH at 16 weeks (P < 0.01; t-test); however, the weight of treated N rats was not significantly affected. Ventricular mass was reduced by cilazapril in GH and N rats (GH 259 +/- 10 vs 306 +/- 11, P < 0.001; N 171 +/- 3 vs 195 +/- 4 mg/100 g BW, P < 0.001). 6.

    "236": "When evaluating preanaesthetic abnormal serum potassium (S-K) levels, the anaesthetist often relies upon blood tests performed on admission to hospital 1 or more days prior to surgery. However, the S-K is often altered between admission to hospital and the induction of anaesthesia. In this study, we examined the effects of health status and medication on the preoperative change in S-K concentration in 150 unselected elderly men awaiting urological operations. Oral daily medication was not given preoperatively on the day of surgery. One third of the patients showed a change of 0.4 mmol/l or more (range -1.1 to +1.2), with an increase as common as a decrease. Those on treatment with calcium-channel blockers or diuretics showed an increase in the S-K concentration in the preoperative period, while patients using oral antidiabetics showed a decrease. The use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was not a significant predictor of the change in S-K concentration. In conclusion, we found that alterations in serum potassium were common prior to surgery, but only a small fraction of this variance could be accounted for by health status and medication.",

ISH is the most frequent type of hypertension in patients over 65 years of age and is associated with increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Decreased arterial compliance, increased peripheral vascular resistance, changes in cardiac output, decreases in plasma renin activity, and reduced beta-adrenergic function are all possible mechanism contributing to hypertension in older patients. Environmental factors that may contribute to hypertension in this population include diet, exercise, and salt sensitivity. Currently, the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) is the only study that has evaluated the efficacy of treating ISH. The risk of stroke was lowered in patients who received low doses of the diuretic chlorthalidone, which was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and isosorbide dinitrate have been shown to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with ISH. Because the SHEP study is the only trial to document a decrease in morbidity, diuretics are considered firstline therapy for patients with a SBP of > or = 160 mm Hg. In older patients, it is prudent to initiate antihypertensive therapy at lower doses with a more gradual increase in dosage. The SHEP trial demonstrated a significant reduction in morbidity with a trend toward decreased mortality when patients with ISH received pharmacologic treatment. More studies are necessary to determine whether other antihypertensive agents will have similar effects on mortality in patients with ISH.", 
    "245": "Fifty two patients of severe hypertension, diastolic blood pressure > or = 115 mmHg, with or without acute complications, were treated with sublingual nifedipine 10 mg or sublingual captopril 25 mg in a randomized prospective in patient study with careful clinical monitoring. Both the drugs were safe and effective in rapidly lowering blood pressure. Nifedipine appeared to be superior to captopril with earlier onset of action, greater magnitude of response and longer duration of action. No significant side effects were observed in either of the two groups.", 
    "246": "We compared the effects of Hydralazine and Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) with those of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril on mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (NYHA class III and IV). Patients receiving conventional treatment with digoxin and diuretics were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 51), hydralazine-ISDN. (n = 50) or captopril (n = 52) in a double blind trial. At the end of 6 months there were 14 deaths in the placebo group (27.4%) as compared with 11 deaths in the hydralazine-ISDN group (22%)--a mortality reduction of 20% (P > 0.05) and 10 deaths in the captopril group (19.2%)--a mortality reduction of 30% (p > 0.05). At the end of one year, mortality was 50%, 42% and 30% in the placebo, hydralazine-ISDN and captopril groups respectively with a mortality reduction of 16% in the hydralazine-ISDN group (p > 0.05) and 40% in the captopril group (p < 0.05) compared to the placebo group. The mortality reduction was mainly due to reduction in deaths attributed to progressive heart failure. The data suggests that the addition of captopril to conventional treatment significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe congestive heart failure. Hydralazine-isorobide dinitrate also reduced mortality but statistically this was not significant.", 
    "247": "The antihypertensive and haemodynamic efficacies of ketanserin and ketanserin plus enalapril were compared. The monotherapy phase of the study involved the oral administration of 40 mg ketanserin twice daily or 20 mg enalapril once daily for 12 weeks to 25 hypertensive patients. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced by both drugs. Left ventricular function both at rest and during effort improved significantly with either drug. This was due to a reduction of end-systolic volume; end-diastolic volume decreased only with the use of enalapril. Combination therapy, involving 16 patients and both drugs given at the original dosage schedule for 12 weeks, resulted in further reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and an improvement in left ventricular function; indices of diastolic function were not modified. In conclusion, ketanserin and enalapril showed comparable antihypertensive and haemodynamic activities. A combination of ketanserin and enalapril increased the favourable characteristics of both drugs.",

Four months later, balloon-mounted coil stents were placed into the abraded coronary arteries of each animal. Twenty-four animals then were randomly assigned to one of two groups: enalapril, and control. The enalapril group received 50 mg orally twice daily starting 1 week before intracoronary stenting.",

The change in minimal lumen diameter from immediately after stenting to follow-up was not significantly different between control and enalapril groups. Area stenosis and maximal intimal thickness obtained by morphometric analysis were also compared, and the mean percentage area stenosis for the control group was 39 +/- 12%/31% +/- 16% and for enalapril 36% +/- 14%/35% +/- 19%. The maximal intimal thickness in the control group was 573 microns +/- 204 microns/605 microns +/- 266 microns and in the enalapril group 530 microns +/- 220 microns/424 microns +/- 237 microns. There was no statistical difference.",

    "252": "We studied the effects of lisinopril (Lis) and captopril (Cap), two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, on calcium in ischemia/reperfusion and normal rat hearts. Ischemia/reperfusion hearts were subjected to 15 min ischemia followed by 1 or 30 min reperfusion. Lis 0.1 mumol.L-1 and Cap 200 mumol.L-1 decreased the concentration of calcium in ischemia/reperfusion hearts (the content of calcium in reperfusion 1 min heart were reduced from 4.0 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.9 mumol/g dry wt respectively). In cultured cell of neonatal rat heart, both drugs inhibited the uptake of 45Ca2+. The activity of Na+,K(+)-ATPase prepared from rat heart was increased (activity increased from 15.7 +/- 2.3 in control group to 21.2 +/- 2.0 and 22.0 +/- 3.1 mumol/h mg protein in Lis and Cap groups, respectively). This calcium lowering effects of Lis and Cap may be important in protecting the ischemia/reperfusion damage of myocardium.", 
    "253": "1. The feedback control of arterial blood pressure by the kidney in the range of hours was investigated in resting, conscious foxhounds. 2. A servo-control device (connected to an aortic occlusive cuff implanted above both renal arteries) was used to maintain a constant pressure difference of 20 mmHg between aortic pressure measured proximal (mean arterial blood pressure: MAP) and distal (renal artery pressure: RAP) to the aortic cuff. 3. Protocol 1 (n = 6) served as a 4 h time control without intervention, protocol 2 (n = 6) consisted of three periods: after a control of 20 min duration, the servo-control device was activated for 180 min; this was followed by a recovery period of 40 min. Protocol 3 (n = 6) was as protocol 2, but during converting-enzyme inhibition. 4. Servo-control increased plasma renin activity (PRA) transiently from 0.5 ng angiotensin I (AI) ml-1 h-1 to a peak value of 2.4 ng AI ml-1 h-1, subsequently both RAP and MAP rose to reach a new steady state. During this increase in RAP, PRA declined to 1.4 ng AI ml-1 h-1. 5. On average, the compensation of the pressure decrease sensed by the kidney amounted to 63% of the error signal (closed-loop gain of 0.63 +/- 0.1). 6. Converting-enzyme inhibition reduced this closed-loop gain significantly (protocol 2 vs. protocol 3, 0.63 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.1; P < 0.05). 7. It is concluded, that the kidney plays an important role in medium-term blood pressure regulation, most probably via the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "254": "The immediate goal of management of heart failure is to improve cardiac function and eliminate symptoms. On the other hand, the final goal is to improve the quality of life and survival. In this chapter, general approaches to fulfill these goals are discussed. First, precise evaluation of the patient is necessary and the underlying cause of heart failure must be diagnosed. If possible, the underlying cause should be rectified. Precipitating factors, such as infection, should also be removed. Appropriate therapeutic measures are then selected according to the type and severity of heart failure. In pharmacotherapy, digoxin, diuretics and vasodilators are usually used in combination. In refractory heart failure, inotropic drugs, including sympatomimetic amines, are usually effective. Special measures including dialysis and assisted circulation, may also be considered in acute or refractory heart failure. Finally, management of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure is still controversial.", 
    "255": "About 40% of cardiac death in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported to be due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Therefore, it is important to know how to treat ventricular arrhythmia associated with CHF. Recently, proarrhythmic effect and negative inotropic effect of antiarrhythmic drugs (class I agents), have been noted and class III agents, especially amiodarone is expected to have preventing effects for sudden death. Furthermore, drug therapy such as beta blocker and ACE inhibitor and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has advanced.", 
    "256": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) due to idiopathic cardiomyopathy is reviewed. CHF in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is caused mainly by myocardial systolic dysfunction. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and digitalis are the first choice drugs. ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective in prolonging life and improving quality of life. Recently, long-term beta-blockade therapy has been shown to be useful. CHF in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by decreased myocardial compliance. The beneficial effect of verapamil in HCM is related to improved relaxation and diastolic filing. Verapamil is also effective in relieving myocardial ischemia. Beta-blockade decreases pressure gradient and oxygen consumption. Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is a very rare disease and decreased myocardial compliance is responsible for CHF.", 
    "257": "It is the current opinion that an ideal antihypertensive drug should reduce blood pressure (BP) not only at rest but also during stressful situations. The current study was aimed to compare the effects of the selective alpha 1-adrenergic blocker terazosin (5 mg once daily) and of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) on cardiovascular response to a set of standardized laboratory stressors, such as mental arithmetic, handgrip test and cycle ergometry, in a group of 16 essential hypertensive patients. The study was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial preceded by a placebo run-in period. Terazosin and enalapril had a comparable effect on resting BP, reducing systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure from 159.5 +/- 13.9/101.6 +/- 8.8 mm Hg during placebo by 7.8%/6.7% and by 11.3%/10.2%, respectively. The \"response\" rate to the two treatments was approximately the same, being 69% and 75% after terazosin and enalapril, respectively. During mental arithmetic, from an average of 181.6 +/- 17.8/118.6 +/- 11.5 mm Hg during placebo, BP was reduced by 11.5%/7.9% after terazosin and by 13.6%/8.5% after enalapril; during handgrip test, BP decreased from 207.2 +/- 22.2/142.2 +/- 13.6 mm Hg by 7.3%/8.4% after terazosin and by 7.7%/7.1% after enalapril; finally, during cycle ergometry, terazosin and enalapril lowered BP by 5.4%/6.7% and 7%/3.1%, respectively, from a placebo value of 215.5 +/- 17.3/127.6 +/- 11.2. No significant difference in antihypertensive efficacy was observed between the two drugs, either at rest and during stress testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Although these agents all effectively lower arterial pressure, they have somewhat diverse renal hemodynamic profiles. This report reviews the various similarities and differences in renal hemodynamic profiles among the different antihypertensive agents.", 
    "259": "The prevalence rates and correlates of antihypertensive drug use among individuals with hypertension were determined using data derived from five biennial population-based surveys conducted between 1981 and 1990 in two New England communities. Point prevalence estimates were determined for nine categories of antihypertensive agents at five time points, and were analyzed by age and sex using multiple logistic regression. In the first cross-sectional survey, the prevalence of use per 1000 individuals with hypertension was 235.4 for diuretics, 57.1 for beta-blockers, 65.5 for combination products, 29.2 for central alpha-agonists, 2.8 for peripheral alpha-antagonists, and 8.4 each for adrenergic blockers and direct vasodilators. The prevalence rates for calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased sharply between the third and fourth survey cycles. Significant age- and sex-related differences in antihypertensive use were detected.", 
    "260": "1. Measurements of superior mesenteric artery and portal venous blood flow were made non-invasively along with systemic and other regional (cardiac index, forearm and cutaneous blood flow) vascular responses to acute ingestion of the ACE inhibitor captopril (50 mg) or placebo (50 mg vitamin C), in 12 healthy subjects while supine and during head-up tilt. 2. After captopril, superior mesenteric artery and portal blood flow rose markedly with a reduction in superior mesenteric artery vascular resistance. Supine blood pressure was unchanged but cardiac index and forearm blood flow rose; during head-up tilt, blood pressure fell in some subjects. 3. There was a rise in levels of plasma renin activity and a fall in levels of plasma angiotensin II after captopril. After placebo, there were no significant changes in splanchnic blood flow, systemic or other regional responses and in biochemical measurements, while supine. 4. Our studies indicate that captopril is a potent dilator of the splanchnic vascular bed and suggest that this action may contribute to its therapeutic effects. The studies indicate a role for angiotensin II in the control of this large vascular bed although other agents (bradykinin, prostacyclin) may contribute.", 
    "261": "Regulatory peptides, including neuropeptides, are metabolized by membrane-bound peptidases. We have localized the membrane peptidases angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), and aminopeptidase M (APM) in normal and inflamed human synovium by immunohistochemistry and enzyme histochemistry. ACE was localized to endothelial cells of all vessels, whereas endothelial DPPIV and APM were restricted to veins and capillaries of some cases. Perivascular spindle-shaped cells stained positively for APM, but rarely for ACE and DPPIV. Synovial lining cells were universally positive for APM but rarely for ACE or DPPIV, whereas a subintimal layer of spindle-shaped cells was frequently positive for all three enzymes, particularly APM. Staining for each enzyme was also observed on some stromal cells. Inflamed synovium displayed increased cellularity with corresponding increases in membrane peptidase staining. APM-positive, perivascular spindle-shaped cells and DPPIV-positive lymphocytes frequently bore HLA class II antigens. This distribution of membrane peptidases supports the hypothesis of a functional compartmentalization of vascular peptidergic systems, with the activities of vasoactive peptides localized to their sites of release. Furthermore, metabolic pathways for regulatory peptides may vary between different structures within human synovium, and these enzymes may be of different relative importance in normal and inflamed tissues. The implied regional control of regulatory peptide activity by membrane peptidases suggests novel potential approaches to the pharmacological manipulation of inflammation by specific enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "262": "Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac ventricular hormone that may be a sensitive and specific marker of changes in ventricular function. In a prospective, randomised open trial with 16 patients followed for 6 months after first Q wave anterior myocardial infarction we set out to determine: whether BNP concentrations are raised acutely, the effect on circulating BNP of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, how BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations compared as correlates of left-ventricular ejection fraction, and whether plasma BNP concentrations could distinguish patients with low (< 40%) and relatively preserved (> 40%) ejection fractions. Plasma concentrations of BNP measured on days 2, 7, 8, 42, and 180 postinfarction were significantly raised in patients compared with normal controls and to a proportionately greater degree than ANP concentrations. Treatment with placebo (n = 8) or oral captopril (n = 8) from day 8 resulted in significantly lower BNP concentrations at days 42 (p = 0.05) and 180 (p < 0.05) in the captopril-treated group. Compared with ANP, BNP concentrations were much more strongly correlated with radionuclide-measured left-ventricular ejection fraction at days 2, 42, and 180. All 8 patients with baseline (day 2) ejection fractions of 40% or above had plasma BNP concentrations less than 10 pmol/L, whereas the 8 patients with ejection fractions less than 40% had BNP concentrations greater than 10 pmol/L. Our findings suggest that measurements of circulating BNP may identify those patients with significant left-ventricular dysfunction who have been highlighted by the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement study as likely to benefit from long-term ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction.", 
    "263": "Six angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides were isolated from a bonito bowels autolysate. Their amino acids were sequenced as Tyr-Arg-Pro-Tyr, Gly-His-Phe, Val-Arg-Pro, Ile-Lys-Pro, Leu-Arg-Pro, and Ile-Arg-Pro. Peptides having corresponding amino acid sequences were synthesized by a solid-phase method and their inhibition of the activity measured. IC50 of these peptides were estimated to be 320, 1100, 2.2, 2.5, 1.0, and 1.8 microM, respectively. The role of carboxyl terminal proline residues on the inhibition is discussed.", 
    "264": "We studied the effect of neurogenic inflammation on airway blood flow in anesthetized F-344 rats. Three successive determinations of blood flow were made by injecting radionuclide-labeled microspheres suspended in 70% dextrose into the left ventricle. A selective agonist of the tachykinin receptor neurokinin 1 (NK1) increased airway blood flow, but NK2- and NK3-selective agonists were without effect. The natural agonist of NK1 receptors, substance P (1 micrograms/kg), increased airway blood flow, an effect that was abolished by the selective NK1 receptor antagonist CP-99,994 [(+)-(2S,3S)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine] but not by the (2R,3R)-enantiomer CP-100,263. Capsaicin (25 micrograms/kg), a drug that releases tachykinins and calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory nerves, increased airway blood flow, and again this effect was abolished by CP-99,994. We also studied the effect of a selective inhibitor (captopril, 2.5 mg/kg) of the tachykinin-degrading enzyme kininase II [or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)] on substance P-induced airway vasodilation. Captopril potentiated and prolonged the vasodilator effect of substance P. We conclude that neurogenic vasodilation in rat airways is due to the release of substance P, acts via NK1 receptors, and may be modulated by ACE.", 
    "265": "Renal and systemic hemodynamics were studied in rats 1 month after induction of myocardial infarction by ligation of the left coronary artery. The mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index were not different from controls, but there were striking elevations in heart weight (p < 0.001), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (p < 0.002), and renal vascular resistance (p < 0.01). Renal blood flow and the percent of cardiac output perfusing the kidneys were reduced by 18% (p < 0.01) and 14% (p < 0.01), respectively. Acute angiotensin inhibition was studied at a dose of the converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, or the renin inhibitor, CP71362, that lowered the mean arterial pressure by 15 mm Hg in normal rats. In normal rats, enalapril and CP71362 were without effect on renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular resistance (RR), and RBF as a percent of cardiac output. However, in rats with myocardial infarction, enalapril and CP71362 increased the RBF and RBF as a percent of cardiac output and lowered the RR to levels similar to normal controls (p < 0.02). Enalapril and CP71362 were equally effective in reducing the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and total peripheral resistance in rats with myocardial infarction. These data demonstrate significant intrarenal vasoconstriction following myocardial infarction in the absence of detectable changes in mean arterial pressure or cardiac index. Converting enzyme inhibition or renin inhibition had similar beneficial effects on cardiorenal function, suggesting that both classes of compounds act by a similar mechanism to improve renal hemodynamics in congestive heart failure.", 
    "266": "In other studies, we noted decreased reactivity of resistance arteries to endothelin-1 (ET-1) in hypertensive rats and humans. To determine whether these changes are reversible with antihypertensive treatment, we examined a hypertensive model exquisitely sensitive to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, the two-kidney, one-clip (2K, 1C) Goldblatt hypertensive rat. Rats were allowed to become hypertensive for 6 weeks. At this point, either the clip was removed, or rats were treated with 5-10 mg/kg/day cilazapril, 100-150 mg/kg/day metoprolol, or 25 mg/kg/day hydralazine, or were left untreated. After 8 weeks more, mesenteric resistance arteries were examined after mounting on a wire-myograph. Blood pressure (BP) and heart/body weight ratio were normalized in unclipped and cilazapril-treated rats. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was normalized only in the unclipped group. Media width, media/lumen ratio, and media cross-sectional area were similar in control normotensive, unclipped, and cilazapril-treated rats and increased in untreated hypertensive, metoprolol, and hydralazine groups. Dose-response curves of resistance arteries to ET-1 were significantly blunted in untreated hypertensive rats (maximum active tension = 2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 3.4 +/- 0.1 N/m in control, p < 0.01), metoprolol-treated (2.2 +/- 0.4 N/m), and hydralazine-treated rats (2.1 +/- 0.5 N/m), and were normalized in cilazapril (3.3 +/- 0.1 N/m) and unclipped rats (3.2 +/- 0.1 N/m). Similar effects were noted in response to norepinephrine (NE) and arginine vasopressin (AVP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "267": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats during long-term inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. Nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) was placed in the drinking water for 4 weeks (approximately 100 mg/kg per day). Separate groups of rats were coadministered the angiotensin II antagonist A-81988 in the drinking water ranging from approximately 0.001 to 1 mg/kg per day. Control groups received only tap water or A-81988 alone. Each week, rats were placed in metabolic cages, and tail-cuff blood pressures and blood samples were taken. L-NAME produced a sustained elevation in tail-cuff pressure that was completely prevented by A-81988. No changes in creatinine clearance, sodium excretion, plasma creatinine concentration, or blood urea nitrogen were observed. Food and water intakes were identical in all groups. Water excretion was significantly increased in L-NAME-treated animals regardless of additional inhibitor treatment, suggesting a possible role for nitric oxide synthase in the control of water excretion; this effect was independent of blood pressure. Although less potent than A-81988, the angiotensin II antagonist losartan and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril also blocked L-NAME-induced hypertension. In a separate series of experiments, rats were not given A-81988 until 2 weeks after hypertension had fully developed in L-NAME-treated rats. Within 1 week of treatment with the angiotensin II antagonist, tail-cuff pressure returned to normal. We conclude from these studies that long-term inhibition of endogenous nitric oxide production produces an angiotensin II-dependent form of hypertension.", 
    "268": "The pharmacological potency of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (lisinopril and enalaprilat) on the transcription of low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase genes was examined in human vascular smooth muscle cells and compared with the action of Ca(2+)-channel blockers (manidipine, verapamil, and diltiazem). Analogous to Ca(2+)-channel blockers, nanomolar concentrations of enalaprilat or lisinopril stimulated the synthesis of low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA and amplified the transcription induced by recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB. In contrast to Ca(2+)-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors did not alter the transcription of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene. Platelet-derived growth factor BB stimulated the translocation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C. Similar to Ca(2+)-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors reduced the translocation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors and Ca(2+)-channel blockers inhibited platelet-derived growth factor BB-induced transcription of c-fos and c-jun genes. The findings suggest that increased de novo synthesis of mRNA low density lipoprotein receptor apparently involves the participation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C and transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun.", 
    "269": "The experiments have been performed on isolated Langendorff rat's hearts. Perfusion pressure (PP) has been increased from 40 to 120 mm Hg by steps. It has been found out, that captopril, indomethacin and verapamil (blockers of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, eicosanoids synthesis and calcium channels, respectively) increased volume velocity of coronary flow (VVCF) at PP within the range of 80-120 mm Hg, decreased the value of the autoregulation index and the coronary vasodilatory reserve by 28-39%, apparently due to decrease of the basal tone of coronary vessels, while the maximum reactive hyperemia coronary flow was not changed thereby. The blockade of No-synthase by NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (NG-MMLA) caused reduction of VVCF at PP 40 mm Hg by 28.5%, the autoregulation index by 79% and the coronary reserve by 29% due to reduction of reactive hyperemic flow. Captopril and NG-MMLA did not change while verapamil and indomethacin decreased intraventricular pressure. Thus, the decrease of the VVCF, caused by NG-MMLA and its increase caused by addition of inhibitors could be connected with inhibition of the synthesis of substances modulating autoregulation of coronary blood flow, and obviously did not depend on changes in functional activity of myocardium.", 
    "270": "In this multicentre trial in general practice the effect of one year of therapy with amlodipine or enalapril on quality of life and blood pressure was studied in 461 hypertensive patients. Quality of life was evaluated by means of a questionnaire administered on five occasions during the study. A total of 125 questions were distributed between psychological general well-being, own perception of health, social relations, sexual and cognitive functioning, and a combined index for frequency and intensity of symptoms. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing blood pressure, from 162/106 to 142/91 mm Hg, and had the same effect on quality of life. Neither of the drugs reduced quality of life, and in some of the variables a slight improvement (2-5%) was observed. The two compounds were tolerated equally well. Apart from class-typical effects (coughing for enalapril and edema for amlodipine) no clinically significant side effects were experienced.", 
    "271": "Given the same level of arterial pressure control, studies in diabetic animal models have demonstrated certain classes of antihypertensive medication to confer better overall preservation of renal histologic features and function as well as reduced albuminuria when compared with other agents. The present study was designed to assess whether any differences exist among antihypertensive agents with regard to progression of diabetic renal disease and albuminuria in human subjects.", 
    "272": "The study was a randomized, prospective, parallel group design that evaluated the effects of a converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril; group 1), a calcium antagonist (diltiazem hydrochloride; group 2), and a combination of a loop diuretic and a beta-blocker (furosemide and atenolol; group 3) in 30 subjects. All subjects received a low-salt, low-protein diet. Metabolic (blood glucose, cholesterol profiles, and urine urea nitrogen and sodium levels) as well as renal hemodynamic (renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate) profiles and arterial pressure measurements were performed at various intervals during an 18-month period.", 
    "273": "Both groups 1 and 2 had significantly slower rates of decline in glomerular filtration rate compared with group 3. No significant differences were observed in renal hemodynamics between groups 1 and 2 at 18 months. Group 3 had the worst metabolic, lipid, and side-effect profile of any group. Reductions in albuminuria were not different between groups 1 and 2, but both were significantly reduced compared with group 3.", 
    "274": "Given a similar level of arterial pressure control, both lisinopril and diltiazem slow progression of diabetic renal disease and reduce albuminuria to a greater extent than does the combination of a loop diuretic and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist. These drugs were also better tolerated and produced no adverse metabolic effects.", 
    "275": "We assessed the acute effects of 2.5 mg oral cilazapril on systemic and coronary hemodynamics in seven renovascular hypertensive patients with a chronically overactive renin-angiotensin system (RAS), but with no electrocardiographic or echocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. Cilazapril resulted in a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure and coronary vascular resistance, together with a prolonged increase in coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF). Post-cilazapril handgrip resulted in larger increases in CSBF in response to a given increase in myocardial oxygen requirements. It is concluded that the chronic activation of the RAS exerts an adverse influence on the control mechanisms of CSBF and that converting enzyme inhibition reverses the effects of angiotensin II on coronary hemodynamics. Converting enzyme inhibitors may have a cardioprotective role in renovascular hypertension.", 
    "276": "We tested whether patients with essential hypertension (EH) have metabolic evidence of increased adrenergic activity, and if a relationship exists between carbohydrate metabolism and the blood pressure (BP) response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Study 1 included 59 subjects who underwent resting ambulatory BP, heart rate, and resting energy expenditure (REE) measurement (by indirect calorimetry). REE was directly related to lean body mass (LBM) (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001) and to fasting plasma insulin levels (p < 0.03), after adjusting for LBM and age) but not to BP. The 38 subjects with EH had significantly higher fasting plasma insulin levels (54 +/- 4 vs 42 +/- 4 pM; p < 0.05) than the 21 normotensive subjects. When normalized by the LBM, the hypertensive patients had significantly higher REE values than the normotensive subjects (89 +/- 2 vs 78 +/- 3 J min-1.kg-1; p < 0.005). No differences in the other measured variables were found between the two groups. Thus, in this group of lean patients with stable EH, relative hyperinsulinemia is associated with a small increase in REE, the significance of which remains to be determined. In study 2, 20 patients with EH received an oral glucose tolerance test and a euglycemic insulin clamp before and after 3 months of treatment with cilazapril. Glucose-induced insulin response, but not insulin sensitivity, was improved by treatment in the whole group. Before therapy, the 12 responders (diastolic BP < 95 mm Hg) had similar glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity to the eight nonresponders. Responders, however, had lower fractional potassium excretion than nonresponders both during fasting (9.6 +/- 1 vs 16.0 +/- 2.4%; p < 0.02) and during the glucose load (9.1 +/- 1.4 vs 13.1 +/- 1.1%; p < 0.04). In the responders, fasting potassium levels at baseline were directly related to the decrease in BP (p < 0.01) and to the improvement of glucose-induced insulin response (p < 0.04) achieved after treatment. Thus, the therapeutic effect of ACE inhibition is in part related to fractional potassium excretion, which, in turn, affects glucose tolerance through the influence of potassium levels on glucose-induced insulin release.", 
    "277": "Reduction of blood pressure as the only therapeutic goal of antihypertensive treatment may no longer be appropriate. High blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have shown an inconsistent reduction in major cardiovascular endpoints. Importantly, the incidence of coronary artery disease has been reduced to only a small extent, suggesting that factors beyond high blood pressure are important in the genesis of atherosclerotic disease in hypertensive patients. It is evident, for example, that patients with hypertension have an exaggerated vulnerability to the consequences of lipid abnormalities. Moreover, it has recently been established that hypertension is characterized by insulin resistance and altered glucose tolerance. As a result, high plasma concentrations of insulin produce proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle and connective tissue, and they may adversely affect the lipid profile. The left ventricle is also involved in hypertension, independent of blood pressure. There is growing evidence that there are increases in the muscle mass of the left ventricle and changes in its diastolic filling characteristics at very early stages of hypertension. The arterial circulation is similarly involved, for alterations in structure or function (reflected by diminished arterial compliance) can be demonstrated prior to the appearance of clinical hypertension. New therapeutic strategies should be aimed at the full spectrum of hypertension-related changes. Because the renin-angiotensin system can contribute to the structural and functional cardiovascular characteristics of this condition, such agents as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be especially effective in preventing or reversing these abnormalities and are emerging as a treatment of choice for hypertension.",

Data concerning costs, incidence, prevalence and survival are used to construct an age-dependent semi-Markov-chain model. Two scenarios are compared. The first reflects the continuation of common practice. The second, containing assumptions made on the basis of results from randomised clinical trials, reflects the situation in which ACE inhibitors are given as first-line pharmacotherapy. Conditional on the estimates and assumptions made, it is shown that prescribing ACE inhibitors as first-line pharmacotherapy will improve survival by about 4% over the first 10 years, and will save about 17% in costs over the first 10 years.

The contractions were not modified by the enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10(-5) M of each). The pD2 values for (Sar9,Met(O2)11)SP (NK1 receptor agonist), (Nle10)NKA(4-10) (NK2 receptor agonist) and (MePhe7)NKB (NK3 receptor agonist) were 8.3, 6.1 and 8.2, respectively. (Sar9,Met(O2)11)SP was the most efficacious of the three agonists. The results are compatible with the presence of NK1 and NK3 receptors. The low pD2 value for the NK2 agonist may reflect a lack of NK2 receptors and interaction of the NK2 agonist with NK1 receptors. The contraction caused by the NK1 receptor agonist was inhibited competitively by the highly selective NK1 receptor antagonist (+/-) CP-96,345; the pA2 value was 5.5. Also the contraction caused by the NK2 receptor agonist was inhibited competitively by (+/-) CP-96,345 with a pA2 value of 5.7, supporting the view that the two agonists (Sar9,Met(O2)11)SP and (Nle10)NKA(4-10) interact with the same receptor. The selective NK2 receptor antagonist actinomycin D did not affect the contraction caused by the NK2 receptor agonist.

Ramiprilat (50 micrograms/kg), losartan (10 mg/kg), or saline were administered prior to reperfusion, and angiotensin II (2.5 ng/kg per min) was infused 15 min prior to occlusion and throughout the remainder of the experiment. Losartan was supplemented (10 mg/kg) after 1 h of reperfusion. These non-hypotensive doses of ramiprilat and losartan were demonstrated to significantly antagonize the systemic pressor effects of i.v. challenge with angiotensin I (15% of control, maximum) and II (5% of control, maximum), respectively, for the duration of the experiment. Systemic hemodynamic and +dP/dtmax changes due to occlusion/reperfusion or drug administration were similar between treatment groups.

    "294": "In homogenates of the endothelium and smooth muscle cum adventitia of the rat aorta, exogenous angiotensin (ANG) I was found to be degraded to des-aspartate-ANG I (des-Asp-ANG I) instead of ANG II. ANG II and ANG III were not detectable in either of the homogenates after 5, 10 and 30 min of incubation with the decapeptide. However, both the homogenates were able to catalyse hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) to hippuric acid and the catalysis was completely inhibited by 3 microM captopril. The data show that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) present in the homogenates of rat aorta, prepared by normal laboratory procedures, is not able to hydrolyse ANG I to ANG II. This finding has important consequences in the study of vascular ACE as the assay of the enzyme is often carried out using crude homogenate and HHL or other artificial substrates. In addition, the aminopeptidase that degraded ANG I to des-Asp-ANG I was not inhibited by either amastatin or bestatin, indicating that it was not aminopeptidase A or B. Together with the recent findings of other investigators which show that the de novo production of ANG II in vascular tissues is stimulated and inhibited by beta- and alpha-agonists, respectively, our present data may suggest that production of vascular ANG II occurs only in intact tissues and is probably under adrenergic regulation.",

ACE from rat organs had a higher apparent molecular mass than the circulating enzyme, but a similar behavior towards ACE inhibitors. Chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors (captopril or lisinopril) for 25 days, followed by 1 day without treatment, increased plasma ACE, but only slightly modified lung, aorta, heart and kidney specific ACE activity. In the lung the activities of aminopeptidases A and B, two angiotensin degrading enzymes, decreased, as did the activity of aminopeptidase A in the plasma. In vitro, the release of ACE from aortic rings was not suppressed by inhibitors of either serine proteases, metalloproteases, serine and thiol proteases, or aspartyl proteases. After chronic ACE inhibition, the release of ACE from aortic rings was not significantly modified by the presence of protease inhibitors.

Captopril given at the same time as indomethacin or ibuprofen did not decrease both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. However, no interaction between nifedipine administered simultaneously with indomethacin or ibuprofen was noted.

Mechanism of indomethacin and ibuprofen hypertensive action seems to se related with their ability to inhibit prostacyclin biosynthesis.",

Following an eight week wash-out period and a 4 week period of monotherapy with either captopril or hydrochlorothiazide, the combination of captopril 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily was given for 16 weeks. All factors known to affect plasma lipids were held constant throughout the study (i.e. diet, weight, exercise, caffeine, tobacco). There were significant reductions in total and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < 0.01), total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < 0.001) and low density lipoprotein/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < 0.01) ratios. These favourable changes were significant only in patients whose baseline values were above the 90th centile adjusted for age and sex. The combination had a neutral effect on plasma lipids in patients with normal values. The data suggest that the combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide at modest doses does not induce deleterious changes in lipid profile and warrant further long-term controlled studies.

On placebo, acute intravenous ouabain administration significantly and transiently reduced calf flow and increased calf vascular resistance without affecting blood pressure. Canrenoate significantly decreased blood pressure (from 159 +/- 21/105 +/- 9 mm Hg to 141 +/- 14/94 +/- 10, P < .05) and the rise of calf resistance after intravenous ouabain bolus. The latter effect was variable, since it was inhibited almost completely in 8 patients and unaffected in the others. In the patients in whom exogenously administered ouabain was antagonized, canrenoate diminished blood pressure through vasodilation and heightened the red cell Na/K pump. None of these parameters changed significantly in the other patients. Thus these data suggest that the fall in vascular resistance induced by canrenoate is mediated, in part, by the antagonism of endogenous ouabain-like factors.",

    "305": "1 The effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril on arterial function were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats, Wistar-Kyoto rats serving as normotensive controls. 2 Adult hypertensive animals were treated with quinapril (10 mg kg-1 day-1) for 15 weeks, which reduced their blood pressure and the concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma and ventricular tissue to a level comparable with that in normotensive rats. 3 Responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the study. Compared with normotensive and untreated hypertensive rats, responses to noradrenaline were attenuated in hypertensive animals on quinapril, both force of contraction and sensitivity being reduced. Quinapril also attenuated maximal contractions but not sensitivity to potassium chloride. Nifedipine less effectively inhibited vascular contractions in normotensive and quinapril-treated than in untreated hypertensive rats. 4 Arterial relaxation responses by endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitrite, isoprenaline) mechanisms were similar in normotensive and quinapril-treated rats and more pronounced than in untreated hypertensive rats. 5 Cell membrane permeability to ions was evaluated by means of potassium-free solution-induced contractions of endothelium-denuded denervated arterial rings. These responses were comparable in normotensive and quinapril-treated rats and less marked than in untreated hypertensive rats. 6 Intracellular free calcium concentrations in platelets and lymphocytes, measured by the fluorescent indicator quin-2, were similar in normotensive and quinapril-treated rats and lower than in untreated hypertensive rats. 7 In conclusion, quinapril treatment improved relaxation responses and attenuated contractions in arterial smooth muscle of hypertensive rats. These changes may be explained by diminished cytosolic free calcium concentration, reduced cell membrane permeability, and alterations in dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels following long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "306": "Sodium depletion in rats elicits a sodium appetite that results from a cerebral action of angiotensin II (ANG II) and aldosterone. Alcohol also activates the renin-angiotensin system, but the mechanism is poorly understood and not related to sodium excretion. In this study, 2.5 g/kg ip ethanol produced a 20% decline in plasma volume and plasma protein concentration in 1-2 hr and elicited salt appetite beginning in 3-4 hr. Blockade of ANG II synthesis in the brain and periphery with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril eliminated the thirst and salt appetite. Peripheral captopril alone enhanced fluid intake, which indicated that alcohol elevated renin secretion. Ethanol-induced suppression of hepatic plasma protein secretion and the consequent fall in plasma colloid osmotic pressure apparently resulted in hypovolemia and renin secretion, which then produced thirst and salt appetite through an action of ANG II on the brain.",

We examined the potential involvement of the neutrophil chemotactic factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), in ozone-induced inflammation. Exposure-response relationships for ozone and MIP-2 expression were characterized by exposing C57B1/6 mice to 0.1-2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and determining lung levels of MIP-2 mRNA 6 hr after exposure. Temporal relationships between ozone and MIP-2 were determined by exposing mice (2 ppm ozone x 3 hr) and characterizing MIP-2 mRNA expression 0, 2, 6, and 24 hr after exposure. Neutrophils in lung lavage fluid were determined in both exposure-response and time course studies. Ozone concentrations > or = 1.0 ppm increased MIP-2 mRNA and this increase corresponded with recruitment of neutrophils. MIP-2 mRNA was increased immediately after ozone exposure and decreased to control levels by 24 hr. To examine the role of direct oxidant effects in ozone-induced MIP-2 expression, alveolar macrophages were exposed in vitro for 4 hr to 10(-10)-10(-5) M hydrogen peroxide and MIP-2 expression was characterized. MIP-2 mRNA levels in lung macrophages were increased by > or = 10(-9) M hydrogen peroxide. In summary, our findings suggest the chemotactic protein MIP-2 may be responsible, at least in part, for ozone-induced increases in lung neutrophils and indicate that direct exposure of alveolar macrophages to an oxidant is sufficient to induce MIP-2 expression.", 
    "308": "Both glomerular hypertension and hypertrophy have been associated with the development of glomerular injury in models of hypertension and reduced renal mass. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of antihypertensive therapy on these parameters in the remnant kidney model of progressive glomerular sclerosis. Rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy and were randomly assigned to receive either no therapy, the calcium entry blocker (CEB), nifedipine, or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), enalapril. Administration of either drug was associated with a reduction in systemic blood pressure and in the severity of glomerular injury assessed eight weeks after renal ablation. Micropuncture studies four weeks after ablation revealed that systemic and glomerular capillary pressure were high in untreated remnant kidney rats and reduced by enalapril. Administration of nifedipine was associated with a decline in systemic pressure, however, plasma renin levels increased, causing efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and persistence of glomerular hypertension. Morphometric analysis showed that kidney weight, glomerular volume and glomerular capillary radius were lower in nifedipine treated rats than in the other two groups, indicating that the CEB, but not enalapril, inhibited the hypertrophic response to ablation of renal mass. Therefore, both CEIs and CEBs reduce glomerular injury in rats with remnant kidneys but they may act by different mechanisms. CEI reduce glomerular capillary pressure while CEBs inhibit compensatory kidney growth.",

After 4 weeks of single-blind placebo treatment, patients with supine diastolic arterial pressures from 95 to 114 mm Hg were randomized to receive placebo, 4 mg perindopril once daily, or 2 mg perindopril twice daily. The daily dose of perindopril was increased by 4 mg every 4 weeks to a maximum of 16 mg per day. Mean decreases in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were greater with perindopril than with placebo (p < 0.05). The dose-response curve flattened after 8 mg per day, and there was no difference in arterial pressure reduction or in the percentage of responders between once- and twice-daily administration of perindopril. Adverse reactions with perindopril were generally mild and, with the exception of cough, were similar with placebo. The findings of this study indicate that perindopril is effective, well tolerated, and suitable for once-daily administration for the treatment of hypertension.",

This study therefore examined the effects of captopril (50 mg/day for 5 days) during sodium restriction on the pressor response and on angiotensin II and neuropeptide Y levels to infused norepinephrine (0.01 to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min) in 17 hypertensive and 27 normotensive subjects. Angiotensin II increased significantly in response to infused norepinephrine during placebo administration (p < 0.001) but not during captopril administration (p = 0.15). Neuropeptide Y levels decreased in response to captopril (p = 0.02). Despite these changes the pressor response to infused norepinephrine was unchanged with captopril. These data support the conclusion that the antihypertensive action of captopril is unrelated to alterations in norepinephrine-mediated alpha-adrenergic pressor regulation. The finding of a decrease in neuropeptide Y levels may have relevance to the therapeutic effects of captopril.", 
    "311": "To investigate intrarenal hemodynamics of aortocaval, arteriovenous (AV)-fistula rats and the effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition, micropuncture studies were obtained before and after administration of quinapril (100 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1), an ACE inhibitor. AV fistula produced by needle multipuncture was characterized by elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), lower mean arterial pressure, and increased left and right ventricular weights. Effective renal plasma flow was lower in AV-fistula rats, and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) and plasma flow (SNPF) were reduced. Single-nephron filtration faction (SNFF), stop-flow pressure, and glomerular pressure (PG) were increased. The lower SNGFR and SNPF and higher PG and SNFF were associated with higher afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances (RA and RE) and lower ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf). LVEDP correlated positively with with RA, RE, and SNFF (all P < 0.01) and negatively with SNGFR (P < 0.05) and SNPF (P < 0.01). After quinapril these variables returned toward normal. Thus this method for producing AV fistula was useful in creating mild and moderately severe cardiac failure (CHF). Intrarenal hemodynamics of AV were characterized by increased PG and SNFF and lower SNGFR and SNPF associated with increased RA and RE and lower Kf and SNPF correlated and with severity of CHF. Restoration of intrarenal hemodynamics to or toward normal with quinapril supports an important pathophysiological role of renin-angiotensin system in this CHF.", 
    "312": "To determine whether propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) administration ameliorates ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction, we performed coronary occlusion in rats and examined the long-term effects of the drug 19-24 wk after surgery. In view of the well-established role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the reduction of ventricular dilation after infarction, the therapeutic impact of oral PLC (60 mg/kg) was compared with that of enalapril (1 mg/kg). Infarct size measured planimetrically was found to be comparable in untreated, PLC-treated, and enalapril-treated rats, averaging 40-46% of the left ventricular free wall. Heart weight was increased 14, 16, and 11% with no treatment, with PLC, and with enalapril, respectively. The relationship between left ventricular filling pressure and chamber volume demonstrated that PLC and enalapril significantly prevented the expansion in cavitary size after infarction. These protective influences were observed throughout the range of filling pressures measured, from 0 to 30 mmHg. At a uniform reference point of filling pressure of 4 mmHg, untreated infarcted hearts showed an expansion in ventricular volume of 2.17-fold (P < 0.0001). Corresponding increases in this parameter after PLC and enalapril were 36 and 43%, respectively, both not statistically significant. Moreover, PLC was capable of reducing the alterations in myocardial compliance associated with myocardial infarction. In conclusion, PLC reduces the magnitude of decompensated eccentric hypertrophy produced by myocardial infarction in a manner similar to that found with ACE inhibition.", 
    "313": "A calibration technique was developed to quantify blood flow changes in the renal cortex and outer medulla in rats using platinum needle electrodes sensing partial pressure of locally generated hydrogen. Measurements were made in male and female rats to investigate sex differences in the humoral control and autoregulation of regional renal circulations. In males, both cortical and outer medullary blood flows were efficiently auto-regulated above an arterial pressure of 100 mmHg. The converting-enzyme inhibitor quinapril increased blood flow by 20% in both kidney zones, and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin did not change the flow. In females, similar results were obtained only for the cortex; the medulla had a different response pattern. The blood flow was not autoregulated in the experimental pressure range up to 120 mmHg; quinapril did not change the flow, but indomethacin decreased the flow by 16% and at the same time restored its autoregulation capacity. We conclude that: 1) the medulla of female rats has a high basal level of vasodilator prostaglandins, which interferes with blood flow autoregulation in this kidney area, and 2) medullary flow in female rats is little affected by endogenous angiotensin.", 
    "314": "The activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its beneficial modification with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibin after inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated. Fifty patients with acute inferior MI were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg per day of either enalapril or placebo after admission. Blood tests for neurohormone levels and echocardiograms were performed at initial examination and 4 weeks later. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Four weeks after randomization, patients treated with enalapril had lower end-diastolic volume (146 +/- 29 vs 167 +/- 15 ml; p = 0.04), end-systolic volume (56 +/- 18 vs 107 +/- 17 ml; p = 0.03), serum norepinephrine levels (320 +/- 93 vs 465 +/- 77 pg/ml; p < 0.01), angiotensin II levels (18 +/- 6 vs 54 +/- 11 pg/ml; p < 0.01), and atrial natriuretic polypeptide levels (106 +/- 9 vs 122 +/- 17 pg/ml; p = 0.05) than patients given placebo. The incidence of heart failure after MI was also lower in this group (4% vs 16%; p = 0.009). Results show that there is early neurohumoral activation in the course of acute inferior wall MI. Enalapril reduces neurohumoral levels and preserves ventricular volumes. These effects were associated with a reduction in the incidence of heart failure 4 weeks after MI in these patients.", 
    "315": "Previously, we had reported that 7-day administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril markedly reduced electrically evoked pressor responses in the isolated, perfused mesenteric vascular bed of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that quinapril alters postsynaptic vasoconstrictor activity to a variety of vasoconstrictive agents. Quinapril (10 mg/kg/day), administered orally to SHR for 7 days, significantly reduced the potency and the maximal vasopressor response to phenylephrine (2.5-fold and 40%, respectively) and the maximal response to serotonin (50%) compared with the responses from vehicle treated SHR. In contrast, quinapril had no significant effect on the pressor responses to KCl or phorbol ester. Furthermore, an equipotent antihypertensive dose of hydralazine (5 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 7 days) exerted no inhibitory effect on the pressor responses elicited by phenylephrine, KCl phorbol ester, but significantly reduced the maximal response to serotonin. In addition, vasopressor responses to phenylephrine were not affected by an acute (i.e., 75 min) infusion of quinaprilat, the active metabolite of quinapril. The results suggest that 7-day quinapril administration, and not acute treatment, reduces alpha 1 adrenoceptor and S2-serotonergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. However, quinapril did not reduce the vasoconstrictor responses induced by KCl or phorbol ester, indicating that those pressor responses that are due to depolarization or protein kinase C activation are, in part, independent of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. This inhibition of vascular alpha 1 adrenoceptor and S2-serotonergic receptor pressor activity may underlie, in part, the long-term antihypertensive activity of quinapril in the SHR.", 
    "316": "Sixteen essential hypertensive patients were entered into a protocol assessing the effect of Spirapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on blood pressure, the renin-aldosterone system, and renal function. Specifically monitored before, during 6 weeks, and 6 months of Spirapril therapy were plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, serum ACE, the renal clearances of creatinine, inulin, and para-aminohippurate, and urinary albumin excretion. Blood pressure was well controlled. Spirapril stimulated plasma renin activity and suppressed ACE throughout the entire protocol. Renal clearances were unchanged. Renal vascular resistance was decreased. Urinary albumin excretion was decreased. The authors conclude that the ACE inhibitor, Spirapril, when used as an effective antihypertensive agent, preserves renal function, lowers renal vascular resistance, and decreases urinary albumin excretion.", 
    "317": "To investigate the mechanism by which angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition attenuates atherogenesis, we have studied the effects of a non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, enalapril, and an angiotensin receptor antagonist, SC-51316, in cholesterol-fed rabbits. After 3 mo of enalapril treatment (10 mg/kg per d, p.o.) the percent plaque areas in the thoracic aortas of treated animals were significantly reduced (controls: 86.8 +/- 3.5%; treated: 31.1 +/- 8%, P < 0.001). Aortic cholesterol content was also reduced (controls: 31.4 +/- 3.2 mg/g tissue; treated: 7.4 +/- 1.8 mg/g, P < 0.001). Enalapril had no significant effect on plasma lipid levels or conscious blood pressure. In a second study, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist SC-51316 was administered at a dose equivalent to enalapril at blocking angiotensin pressor effects in vivo (30 mg/kg per d, p.o.). Evaluation after 3 mo indicated no significant attenuation of aortic atherosclerosis. These results demonstrate that: (a) enalapril attenuates atherogenesis without affecting either blood pressure or plasma lipid levels; (b) antioxidant activity, found with sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors, is not necessary for reducing plaque formation; and (c) the attenuation of atherogenesis by ACE inhibition may not be due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Alternatively, one must consider the multiple effects of ACE inhibition on other hormone systems, such as bradykinin, or the possibility that alternate angiotensin II receptors may be involved in atherosclerosis.",

However, recent advances include treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (plasmapheresis, stanozolol, and prostacyclin analogues), scleroderma renal crisis (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), and gastric hypomotility (cisapride). This article covers the current approaches to the disease-modifying therapy including those related to the function of collagen-producing fibroblasts, vascular alterations, and the cellular and humoral immune system, as well as treatment of involved organs.", 
    "319": "Renal glomerular hyperfiltration has been proposed as an important contributing factor to the progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in rats with reduced renal mass. However, no clinical studies have assessed the role of glomerular hyperfiltration in the pathogenesis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in humans. In a prospective, randomized, long-term blood pressure control study with up to 3 years follow-up, we showed that good blood pressure control with a mean diastolic blood pressure < or = 95 mm Hg preceded by a 2- to 4-month period of diastolic blood pressure < or = 80 mm Hg improved renal function in hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients. Patients treated with minoxidil, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), or a calcium entry blocker (nifedipine) had improvement in renal function, as indicated by a positive slope of the reciprocal serum-creatine concentration versus time and an increment in glomerular filtration rate. These results suggested that improvement in renal function occurred with these major types of antihypertensive drug treatment. To assess the renal hemodynamics of minoxidil, enalapril, and nifedipine, eight patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center for renal clearance studies on each drug while ingesting a fixed-calorie, 12% protein, 40% fat, and 100 mEq Na/d diet. Mean blood pressure, effective renal plasma flow, and renal vascular resistance did not change during the three phases of treatment. However, minoxidil treatment increased the glomerular filtration rate by 48% versus enalapril and by 79% versus nifedipine. Since minoxidil treatment improves renal function while causing a relative hyperfiltration, glomerular hyperfiltration per se is an unlikely mechanism for the progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in humans.",

The patients were randomized at day 7 to either placebo or captopril (50 mg daily) in a double-blind parallel study over a period of 6 months. The patients were followed up by means of ambulatory ECG monitoring, bicycle ergometer testing, and echocardiographic examination. The duration of ST segment depression detected during ambulatory ECG monitoring was lower in the captopril group (87 minutes) than in the placebo group (638 minutes) (p < 0.001), and the number of patients in the captopril group with exercise-induced ST segment depression (p < 0.01) was lower at the completion of the study. The working capacity increased during the study period from 540 +/- 47 seconds to 738 +/- 41 seconds (p < 0.01) in the captopril group and was higher than that in the placebo group (530 +/- 43 seconds, p < 0.01) at the end of the study. Furthermore, a significant dilation of the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes was observed in the placebo group (p < 0.05); this was prevented in the captopril group where, in addition, a reduction in end-systolic volume was observed (p < 0.05).",

    "327": "Patients with diabetes who have a family history of cardiovascular disease or hypertension are at greatly increased risk for development of diabetic nephropathy. The changes that occur in the diabetic hypertensive kidney (mesangial matrix expansion, altered charge and size selectivity of the glomerular basement membrane, and significantly increased intraglomerular pressure) are not generally present in the nondiabetic hypertensive kidney. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nondihydropyridine calcium blockers are known to attenuate these changes. Patients taking these agents experience a reduction in the proteinuria associated with nephrotic syndrome; this is accompanied by marked reductions in serum cholesterol level, increases in serum albumin level, and reduced morbidity. Other antihypertensive therapies have not been shown to have these effects. Moreover, ACE inhibitors and alpha blockers have been shown to improve insulin resistance in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes. For the patient with diabetes, attention must be given to these factors, and blood pressure medication must be carefully selected.", 
    "328": "Results from renal transplantation experiments demonstrate that a renal defect is responsible for the development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). In addition, studies with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system have shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) is required for the development and maintenance of hypertension in the SHR. These observations prompted us to propose the hypothesis that hypertension in these rats is due to an enhanced renal responsiveness to Ang II. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether an enhanced renal responsiveness to Ang II exists in adult (12- to 14-week-old) SHR relative to Wistar-Kyoto control rats. To prevent hypertension-induced changes in renal function in SHR, we maintained both strains in the normotensive state from 4 weeks of age with long-term captopril treatment (100 mg/kg per day). Intrarenal Ang II infusions induced a significantly greater decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and a significantly greater increase in renal vascular resistance in SHR compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. DuP 753 (Ang II subtype 1 [AT1] receptor antagonist), but not PD 123177 (Ang II subtype 2 receptor antagonist), blocked the renal responses to Ang II in SHR, suggesting that the enhanced renal responsiveness to Ang II was mediated solely by the AT1 receptor subtype. Unlike renal responses to Ang II, renal responses to periarterial renal nerve stimulation were similar in both strains, suggesting a selective renal hyperresponsiveness to Ang II in the SHR rather than a general hyperresponsiveness toward all vasoconstrictors. From these studies in chronically captopril-treated rats, we conclude that 1) SHR have a genetically determined, enhanced renal responsiveness to Ang II; 2) the enhanced renal responsiveness to Ang II is mediated by the AT1 receptor; and 3) renal responses to periarterial nerve stimulation are not significantly enhanced, suggesting a selective hyperresponsiveness to Ang II in the kidneys of SHR.",

Patients > or = 55 years of age with asymptomatic essential hypertension were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Subjects discontinued their previous antihypertensive agents and started hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, extended-release propranolol hydrochloride 120 mg, enalapril maleate 10 mg, or placebo. One capsule was taken for three days and then the dosage was doubled for the remainder of a four-week period. Subsequent crossover treatments were begun without a washout period. In each treatment phase, a battery of psychometric tests was used to assess cognitive and motor function and quality of life; all tests but one were self-administered via computer terminal. Pulse rate and blood pressure were recorded, and compliance was monitored by capsule count. Sixteen of 30 patients interviewed completed the trials; one additional patient was evaluated after receiving all treatments except hydrochlorothiazide.

Except for the hydrochlorothiazide group, blood pressure in the active treatment groups did not differ significantly from placebo; hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced systolic but not diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo. Compared with placebo, hydrochlorothiazide was associated with fewer incorrect responses in a test of complex reaction time and with greater discriminant reaction time response rates; otherwise, no difference between groups was noted in cognitive or motor performance.

Vital signs were determined biweekly before dosing, and blood pressures were measured every 1 to 2 h during two 27-h periods at the beginning and end of treatment. After the first and last doses of all three regimens, the peak effect on blood pressure occurred 5 to 7 h after all three dosages. Neither peak nor trough blood pressure changes showed a clear dose-response relationship.

In the 38 responders among the 48 patients receiving fosinopril (supine DBP decrease of at least 5 mmHg at 24 h postdose), trough-to-peak ratios ranged from 50 to 81%, and the range indicates that fosinopril is efficacious when administered once daily.

Animal groups included control rats, diabetic rats treated with perindopril, diabetic rats receiving triple therapy, and untreated diabetic rats. Treatment was continued for 32 wk. Blood pressure reduction and severity of diabetes, as assessed by body weight and glycemic control were similar with both drug regimens. A similar rise in plasma renin activity occurred in the two groups receiving antihypertensive drugs, whereas the perindopril but not the triple therapy group had suppressed plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. No significant difference was observed in renal function among the four groups. Diabetes was associated with a progressive increase in albuminuria, but this rise was ameliorated by both perindopril and triple therapy. No significant difference was noted in albuminuria between triple therapy and perindopril-treated diabetic rats. Diabetes was associated with glomerular basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, and glomerular volume. No glomerular ultrastructural parameter was affected by antihypertensive drugs.

    "340": "Hypertension is due to disturbance of the complex interplay between numerous known and unknown mechanisms that normally control blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents may, therefore, reduce blood pressure through widely different actions and, at the same time, elicit counterregulatory responses. This is a review of the long-term hemodynamic effects at rest as well as during exercise of nine relatively new antihypertensive compounds: a beta-blocker (epanolol), an alpha-receptor blocker (doxazosin), two double-acting compounds (dilevalol and carvedilol), three calcium antagonists (amlodipine, felodipine, and diltiazem), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), a serotonin antagonist (ketanserin), and low-salt diet as a nonpharmacological treatment in 171 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The results in the treatment groups are compared to the hemodynamic changes seen in 28 hypertensive patients left untreated for 10 years. The patient populations of the different groups were comparable. The invasive hemodynamic technique, including intraarterial blood pressure recording and measurements of cardiac output by Cardigreen, was the same in all studies. While blood pressure remained nearly unchanged in the untreated group, all antihypertensive compounds induced significant and sustained blood pressure reduction both at rest and during exercise. The modest reduction (3-5%) in blood pressure during a low-salt diet was also statistically significant. This review shows the multiplicity of the long-term hemodynamic changes, ranging from a reduction in cardiac output to peripheral vasodilatation, during chronic antihypertensive therapy. In untreated hypertensives, the cardiac output is reduced by 1-2% per year and total peripheral resistance is increased by 2-3% per year. The review also focuses on counterregulatory responses and modify the initial reduction in blood pressure after drug treatment for hypertension. It is concluded that proper understanding of the hemodynamic effects of antihypertensive agents is useful in the selection of the right treatment for specific groups of hypertensive patients.",

Blood pressure, urine protein excretion, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal blood flow (RBF) (inulin and para-aminohippurate clearance) were determined before and after 2 to 3 months of therapy. All three agents lowered blood pressure with minimal side effects in many, but not all, patients. Patients who had a significant lowering of blood pressure in response to lisinopril and verapamil had favorable renal hemodynamic responses as well--GFR remained stable, RBF was stable or increased, and filtration fraction, renal vascular resistance, and proteinuria tended to decrease. Patients whose blood pressure did not decrease had less favorable responses. In the small number of patients who received amlodipine, lowering of blood pressure was associated with a small decrease in GFR. Our results demonstrate a heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive agents in patients with renal disease. We therefore conclude that treatment of such patients should be individualized, and suggest that choice of therapy depend on adequate blood pressure response in conjunction with stabilization of renal function and urine protein excretion. Our data do not support the use of a drug in these circumstances if it does not lower systemic blood pressure.", 
    "351": "Bradykinin and related kinins are peptidic hormones, formed in tissues and fluids during inflammation. Various functional sites have been proposed as mediators of the biological effects of kinins, including the B1, B2 and B3 receptors. The existence of the B1 and the B2 receptor has largely been confirmed, whilst that of the B3 receptor is controversial and needs further confirmation. The role of bradykinin in the pathophysiology of asthma is not well understood, but bradykinin was proposed as a putative mediator of asthma, since asthmatic subjects are hyperresponsive to bradykinin, and since immunoreactive kinins are increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of asthmatic patients. Kinins could provoke bronchoconstriction by acting directly on smooth muscle and/or indirectly by their inflammatory properties. They may also contribute to the symptomatology of allergic and viral rhinitis, since they are the only mediators detected to date that are generated in nasal secretion during experimental and natural rhinovirus colds. Moreover, they can induce relevant symptoms when applied to airway mucosa. It has also been proposed that coughing during treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is linked to the action of kinins, since ACE is able to degrade kinins, and since the effects of ACE inhibitors are reduced by kinin antagonists. Due to their mitogenic properties, kinins have been proposed to regulate lung carcinoma growth. Their action remains speculative, but some findings are of great interest in order to define their role in these pathologies. Despite many studies in animals and in humans, the mode of action of kinins in airways is still poorly understood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the present studies, the interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and the effects of ANP infusion (100 ng.kg-1 x min-1 for 45 min) on arterial pressure and hematocrit were assessed in bilaterally nephrectomized, anesthetized rats. In a first series of experiments, suppression of angiotensin II generation was achieved by chronic (10 days) treatment by the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril in rats maintained on a low-sodium diet. ACEI pretreatment prevented the rise in hematocrit associated with ANP infusion (+2.1 +/- 0.1 vs. +5.8 +/- 0.2%, P < 0.05), without influencing the effect of ANP on arterial pressure. In ACEI-pretreated rats, acute administration of angiotensin II at a subpressor dose (2.5 ng.kg-1 x min-1) restored the ANP-induced increase in hematocrit. In a second series of experiments, acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system was obtained by the ACEI enalaprilat or the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan (both 1 mg/kg i.v. bolus). In the presence of either enalaprilat or losartan, the ANP-induced increase in hematocrit was similarly prevented. These results indicate that the effect of ANP on vascular permeability is modulated by endogenous angiotensin II, possibly due to distinct influences of the two peptides at the level of pre- and postcapillary resistances.", 
    "361": "We investigated the mechanism(s) by which angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition influences peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission. Thus effects of the angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor antagonist losartan (Du Pont 753) were compared with those of the ACE inhibitor benazeprilat on sympathetic neurotransmission in canine gracilis muscle in situ, with alpha-adrenoceptors either intact or irreversibly blocked by phenoxybenzamine. Furthermore, effects of the bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 and the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac were studied after ACE inhibition. Losartan reduced the vasoconstrictor response to exogenous ANG II by 76 +/- 4% at the dose used and lowered muscle perfusion pressures. ACE inhibition by benazeprilat reduced plasma ANG-(1-8) octapeptide levels (from 8 +/- 2 to 2 +/- 1 pM), mean arterial pressure, and muscle perfusion pressures. After ACE inhibition, both HOE 140 (at a dose that reduced the vasodilatory response to exogenous bradykinin by 80 +/- 3%) and diclofenac elevated basal perfusion pressures. Losartan reduced the nerve stimulation-evoked overflow of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) (-14 +/- 6%) and vasoconstrictor responses (alpha-adrenoceptors intact). ACE inhibition increased NE overflow when alpha-adrenoceptors were intact (+12 +/- 5%) and tended to reduce it when alpha-adrenoceptors were blocked (-12 +/- 4%). During ACE inhibition, HOE 140 reduced and diclofenac enhanced the evoked NE overflow. In the absence of ACE inhibition, neither HOE 140 nor diclofenac influenced NE overflow. Our findings indicate that ACE inhibition influences sympathetic neurotransmission via reduced ANG II formation and enhanced bradykinin and prostaglandin accumulation. The effects of ANG II on sympathetic neurotransmission are, however, small under these in vivo conditions.",

    "363": "Cardiac ACE was localized and quantified in hearts from male Wistar rats with LVH due to chronic experimental aortic stenosis and from control rats. With the ACE inhibitor 125I-351A, a derivative of lisinopril, as a radioligand on coronal sections of LVH and control hearts, in vitro autoradiography demonstrated ACE binding in aorta, coronary arteries, atria, and ventricles of both groups. Quantitative analyses revealed that ACE density (counts per minute per cross-sectional area of tissue) was twofold higher within the myocardium of hypertrophied left ventricles compared with controls (p < 0.005). Quantitative morphometry demonstrated a modest increase in the fractional volume of myocytes as well as capillary volume without an increase in the fractional volume of endothelial cells in left ventricular tissue from aortic stenosis rats. These data suggest that an increase in endothelial cell volume per se cannot alone account for the observed doubling of ACE density and support an upregulation of ACE production in hypertrophied tissue. The role of cardiac ACE in intracardiac conversion of Ang I to Ang II and its specific inhibition was studied in isolated, isovolumic beating, buffer-perfused LVH and control hearts. Biochemical conversion rates as well as functional changes in response to 3 x 10(-7) M Ang I were examined in the absence or presence of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (4 x 10(-6) M). After a brief stabilization period, groups of LVH and control hearts were subjected to the following infusion protocols: 15 minutes of vehicle followed by 30 minutes of Ang I plus vehicle, 15 minutes of enalaprilat followed by 30 minutes of Ang I plus enalaprilat (enal/Ang I), or 45 minutes of vehicle only to allow comparison with a time control. Intracardiac Ang I-to-Ang II conversion rate was fourfold higher in LVH than in control hearts (p < 0.05). Infusion of enalaprilat reduced the intracardiac Ang I-to-Ang II conversion rate in LVH hearts by 70% (p < 0.05 versus Ang I). At similar levels of constant coronary flow per gram, Ang I increased coronary perfusion pressure by 23 +/- 5 mm Hg (p < 0.01 versus vehicle) in LVH hearts and by 36 +/- 10 mm Hg (p < 0.005 versus vehicle) in control hearts. When enalaprilat was infused with Ang I, the increase in perfusion pressure was limited to 5 +/- 5 mm Hg (NS versus vehicle) in LVH hearts and 12 +/- 3 mm Hg (p < 0.05 versus vehicle) in control hearts and was significantly lower than in hearts infused with Ang I only (p < 0.05 in LVH and p < 0.05 in control hearts, respectively). Systolic function was not affected by either infusion protocol. In contrast, Ang I infusion was associated with diastolic dysfunction. In LVH hearts, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) increased from 10 +/- 1 mm Hg at baseline to 25 +/- 2 mm Hg at the end of the Ang I infusion (p < 0.001 versus vehicle), which was inhibited by infusion of enalaprilat. In control hearts, there was a lesser increase in LVEDP from 10 +/- 1 mm Hg to 15 +/- 1 mm Hg in response to Ang I (p < 0.05 versus LVH).

All patients were studied in a double-blind manner on two occasions with vehicle control infusions. In study 2, 14 patients comparable to those in the first study had similar measurements made in the supine position before and 30 and 60 min after the administration of enalaprilat (1 mg intravenously).

During upright tilt, plasma norepinephrine and norepinephrine spillover increased comparably with angiotensin II and the vehicle control. During head-down tilt, plasma norepinephrine decreased with both angiotensin II and the vehicle control. Norepinephrine spillover remained elevated relative to control values on both study days during head-down tilt. In study 2, both enalaprilat and vehicle control administration were associated with a slight decrease in mean arterial pressure (5 +/- 2 vs. 3 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS), but no changes were seen in plasma norepinephrine.

The arterioles studied were classified as second-, third-, and fourth-order arterioles with mean diameters of 60.5, 29.9, and 14.8 microns, respectively. Topical administration of 1 nmol/mL angiotensin I or 1 nmol/mL tetradecapeptide renin substrate induced marked vasoconstrictions (i.e., 38.5%, 61.5%, and 90.1% and 25%, 34%, and 88% for second-, third-, and fourth-order arterioles with angiotensin I and tetradecapeptide renin substrate, respectively). The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril significantly inhibited the vasoconstrictions caused by either angiotensin I or tetradecapeptide renin substrate. Almost no vasoconstriction was found when angiotensinogen-rich renin-free plasma containing either 2.45 nmol/mL of angiotensinogen or 1.2 micrograms/mL renin was administered. Conversely, these two compounds induced significant constrictions in cremaster muscle preparations in which normal blood perfusion (and thus circulating renin and angiotensinogen) was left in place. We concluded that, in skeletal muscle, 1) the microvascular network is a very effective site of local angiotensin converting enzyme activity and consequently an important target site of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; 2) the effects of tetradecapeptide renin substrate are very different from those of angiotensinogen from plasma and suggest that a large part of the effect of tetradecapeptide renin substrate was due to its nonspecific hydrolysis; and 3) at the microvascular level, circulating renin and angiotensinogen are more effective in inducing arteriolar constriction, in the presence of their substrate or associated enzyme, than local renin and angiotensinogen.",

Two days after implantation of electrodes, we measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity. Baroreceptor reflex function was assessed with a logistic function curve; the maximum slope of the curve estimated the baroreceptor reflex gain. Data were obtained in rats given acute intravenous administration of either vehicle, the Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, the type 2 antagonist CGP 42112A, or the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. In comparison with vehicle (-1.1 +/- 0.2%/mm Hg), both losartan (-1.8 +/- 0.3%/mm Hg) and lisinopril (-2.4 +/- 0.2%/mm Hg) significantly increased the maximum gain of the baroreceptor reflex control of nerve activity (p < 0.05). In contrast, the type 2 receptor antagonist did not alter baroreceptor reflex function. Similar studies were performed in rats that received an intravenous injection of NG-monomethyl L-arginine (10 mg/kg). The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor increased baseline blood pressure and decreased renal sympathetic nerve activity. Subsequent administration of losartan or lisinopril returned blood pressure to initial hypertensive level, whereas sympathetic nerve activity was increased to a level above the initial control value. The maximum gain of the baroreceptor reflex control of renal nerve activity was increased after the nitric oxide inhibition.

    "372": "Genetic causes account for 20% to 25% of human birth defects, but the largest proportion of birth defects have no definitive etiology and some of these malformations may be due to intrinsic, \"nonpreventable\" spontaneous errors of development. Environmental causes, which include maternal disease states, maternal infection, mechanical factors, problems of constraint, chemicals, drugs, and physical agents, are responsible for only about 10% of human birth defects. The scientific basis for understanding the risk of congenital malformations from exposure to environmental agents is based on several tenets of toxicology and embryology dogma. The first tenet is that essentially all teratogens that have been studied have a typical toxicologic dose response relationship and a no-effect dose. Secondly, the stage of gestation is critical to the effects that are expected, and all stages of embryogenesis and fetogenesis can have vulnerability to environmental toxicants. Thirdly, the response of the embryo and fetus is characteristic for each teratogenic agent, although there is some similarity in the effect of certain teratogens. Appropriately designed developmental toxicology studies and basic embryologic and biologic concepts are all used to estimate the potential reproductive hazard for embryonic death, growth retardation, congenital malformation, and functional deficit.",

The study began in September 1991 and has completed recruitment with 1740 patients across 38 centers (28 U.S., 4 Canada, 6 Europe) by the end of 1992.

Hemodynamic studies were performed noninvasively by means of M-mode echo (central hemodynamics and left ventricular systolic function), 2-D echo-Doppler (left ventricular diastolic function), and pulsed Doppler flowmetry (forearm circulation). Examinations were done at the end of a placebo run-in period and 3 hours after benazepril administration, both on the first day and after 6 weeks of treatment (10 or 20 mg once daily, according to patient response). In comparison with placebo, benazepril reduced systolic (p = 0.04) and diastolic (p = 0.003) blood pressure, because of a significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.03), while cardiac output was unchanged. Forearm vascular resistance was reduced and brachial artery compliance increased, although not to a statistically significant level (both p = 0.07). Both systolic and diastolic left ventricular function were positively influenced by the afterload reduction: End-systolic stress was reduced by 12% (p = 0.07), as was the late diastolic peak flow velocity (p = 0.02). All hemodynamic changes were evident after acute benazepril administration, and no differences was observed between acute and repeated treatment. We conclude that, similar to other ACE-inhibitors, benazepril reduces blood pressure through a reduction in vascular resistance, while cardiac output and heart rate are unaffected. These hemodynamic effects occur as early as after the first administration and exert a favorable influence on left ventricular dynamics.",

The authors administered to a group of 23 patients with acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure (grade II according to Killip) small doses of captopril (4 x 6.25 mg/day)for a period of 10 days from the 1st-4th day after the onset of the disease). From ACE serum levels the effectiveness of these doses was assessed in keeping with data in the literature. As compared with a control group of 26 patients with similar haemodynamic conditions the authors did not find significant differences as regards improvement of the decompensation and in the mortality (\u00e0 3 patients in both groups). As to undesirable effects, arterial hypotension was recorded three times, twice minor proteinuria, once asymptomatic thrombocytopenia. Decisive for future therapeutic decision making are above all the results of the SAVE study which prefers captopril in patients with a yet asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.

Accurate biochemical methods must be available to assess the efficacy of each approach. ACE inhibitors have been very successful and are generally well tolerated but cough is a common side effect, possibly related to their lack of specificity. High doses stimulate renin secretion. Renin inhibitors are theoretically more attractive than ACE inhibitors because of their specificity, and renin inhibitors with adequate oral bioavailability are now available. Due to the reactive rise in renin, however, the effects of the renin inhibitors so far available appear to be very short in duration. There is insufficient evidence to show whether prolonged administration may be successful. With present methods, only circulating angiotensin I and II levels can give an accurate indication of the effectiveness of the drug. The first non-peptide angiotensin II inhibitor, losartan (DuP753, MK 954), is still undergoing clinical trials. Dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin II has been obtained in normotensive volunteers, the effect being closely related to circulating levels of the active metabolite E 3174.

It may be related to effects on the kininogen-kinin (bradykinin) system since the breakdown of bradykinin is prevented by ACE inhibitors. A local accumulation of bradykinin may lead to activation of pro-inflammatory peptides (e.g. substance P, neuropeptide Y) and a local release of histamine. This may also cause cough reflex hypersensitivity. Another more serious adverse effect that has been associated with the use of ACE inhibitors, angioneurotic oedema, may be related to the same mechanisms.",

Furthermore, cardiac hypertrophy was reversed to a significantly greater extent with enalapril than hydrochlorothiazide in a long-term study of previously untreated men.

    "402": "To summarize and discuss four experiments relating to a possible action of angiotensin (Ang) II as a vascular growth factor and to consider the importance of growth factors in hypertension. EXPERIMENT 1: Rats infused with a low dose of Ang II developed a slow pressor response. After 10 days vascular hypertrophy was evident. Other rats infused with Ang II and given hydralazine to prevent the rise in pressure also developed vascular hypertrophy. EXPERIMENT 2: The results of a second experiment suggested that Ang II caused vascular hypertrophy by a mechanism that involves the proto-oncogene c-fos, an intermediary in growth factor action. EXPERIMENT 3: In this experiment hypophysectomy arrested maturation of resistance vessels in the rat and prevented the structural vascular response to increased arterial pressure. Thyroxine and growth hormone prevented both these effects, presumably acting as growth factors. EXPERIMENT 4: In the fourth experiment, young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) given an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for 4 weeks did not fully develop hypertension, even after the ACE inhibition had ceased. This effect was prevented by the infusion of Ang II during the ACE inhibition. These results suggest that the blood pressure rise in SHR has a reversible element related to Ang II.", 
    "403": "Ang II causes vascular hypertrophy by a non-pressor mechanism, possibly as a growth factor. Ang II and other growth factors may be important in the development of a normal vascular system and of abnormal vessels in hypertension.", 
    "404": "INHIBITION OF RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM: It is now possible to effectively block the renin-angiotensin system at several steps by orally active inhibitors. Blockade of renin, the angiotensin coverting enzyme (ACE) or the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT1) receptor leads to different hormonal changes. All three modes of blockade reduce aldosterone and all cause a reactive rise in plasma renin due to removal of angiotensin II tonic inhibition on renal renin release. ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN ANG I AND ANG II: AT1 blockade by losartan is followed by rises in plasma Ang I and Ang II; ACE inhibitors are associated with an increase in plasma Ang I but a fall in Ang II, whereas both plasma Ang I and Ang II fall with renin inhibition. DIFFERENCES IN MODE OF INHIBITION: Potential differences between the mode of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system include differences in the bioavailability of compounds, the effect of ACE on other peptide substrates, particularly bradykinin, the possibility of other actions or unknown substrates for renin and the presence of unblocked AT2 angiotensin receptors in the presence of high levels of Ang II. Whether these will result in clinically important differences remains to be determined.", 
    "405": "DISCOVERY OF LOSARTAN: Losartan (DuP 753, MK 954) is the first potent and selective non-peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist. The discovery of losartan followed an observation that several simple benzylimidazoles are weak Ang II antagonists. These compounds (e.g. S8307) lack potency but are orally active and selective for Ang II receptors (AT receptors). Losartan was synthesized using S8307 and other analogs of the benzylimidazoles as chemical leads.", 
    "406": "Losartan selectively inhibits all Ang II responses that have been studied and lowers blood pressure in several animal models of renin-dependent hypertension. In animals, the antihypertensive efficacy of losartan is similar to that of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors but, unlike ACE inhibitors, losartan is a more selective inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system since it does not affect the metabolism of kinins. Compared with peptide Ang II antagonists (e.g. saralasin), losartan has significant advantages, including a long duration of action, effective oral absorption and no Ang II agonist activity.", 
    "407": "The high selectivity and potency for AT receptors, the non-peptide structure and the oral activity of losartan represent a pharmacological breakthrough. This agent is now being used to elucidate the physiology of AT receptors and is likely to be useful in the therapeutic management of diseases in which the renin-angiotensin system is known to be involved.", 
    "408": "This study explored the possibility that the nucleus reticularis parvocellularis (NRP) acts in concert with the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in the maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Bilateral electrolytic or chemical lesions (kainic acid) were placed in three groups of rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. In the different groups, lesions were placed only in the NRP or RVLM or in both the NRP and RVLM (NRPRVLM). Captopril (5 mg/kg, i.v.) and an arginine vasopressin antagonist (AVPX), d-pentamethylene methylated tyrosine (30 micrograms/kg, i.v.), were sequentially administered. A final procedure consisted of spinal cord transection. The RVLM lesions did not significantly alter MAP (before: 116 +/- 3 mmHg; after: 106 +/- 5 mmHg). Sequential administration of captopril and AVPX each reduced MAP to 87 +/- 5 mmHg and 62 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively. Spinal-cord transection lowered MAP to 38 +/- 2 mmHg. Lesions of the NRP also did not alter MAP (before: 113 +/- 4 mmHg; after: 118 +/- 5 mmHg). Captopril reduced MAP to 109 +/- 7 mmHg, AVPX had no effect, and spinal-cord transection decreased MAP to 31 +/- 3 mmHg. In contrast to the lack of effect of lesions of the RVLM or NRP on MAP, profound hypotension was observed after NRPRVLM lesions (before: 113 +/- 3 mmHg; after: 51 +/- 3 mmHg). Subsequent administration of captopril decreased MAP to 39 +/- 2 mmHg, and AVPX lowered MAP to 32 +/- 1 mmHg. Spinal-cord transection reduced MAP to 23 +/- 1 mmHg. Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, lesions of the RVLM do not decrease MAP because of compensation by the renin-angiotensin system and AVP secretion which is mediated by the NRP. Second, lesions of the NRP do not affect MAP because the intact RVLM can maintain sympathetic tone. Third, the profound hypotension observed after NRPRLVM lesions occurred because of the simultaneous impairment of sympathetic vasomotor activity and the neuroendocrine vasoconstrictor effects of the renin-angiotensin system and AVP secretion.",

    "410": "We studied 20 patients with Chagas' disease, aged between 24 to 64 (mean 44) years. There were 17 male. All patients have positive serologic blood tests for Chagas' disease (immunofluorescence and Machado-Guerreiro test), left ventricular diastolic diameter superior to 55mm and ejection fraction less than 0.60. The patients were divided aleatory in two groups: control group (CG) with 9 patients receiving conventional treatment (digital and diuretics) and enalapril group (EG), with 11 patients where enalapril was added to conventional treatment. The treatment was maintained during two months and the patients were evaluated at the beginning and at the end, when they were submitted to clinical examination, echo-doppler-cardiogram, stress test and 24h Holter monitoring. At two dimensional echocardiographic study we evaluate left ventricular and left atrial diameters, at doppler study the E/A relations, the systolic volume and cardiac index. At the stress test and Holter monitoring we evaluate the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "411": "The comparison between initial and final evaluations, showed that there was a significant improvement of diastolic function (p = 0.04) and a trend to improvement of systolic function (great systolic volume and cardiac index) at EG. The incidence of non sustained ventricular tachycardia was the same in the two groups.", 
    "412": "In Chagas' disease enalapril improves significantly diastolic dysfunction in patients with heart failure. After two months of treatment we observed tendency to improvement of systolic dysfunction and the incidence of arrhythmias induced by stress test.", 
    "413": "A randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled pilot study was done on the use of converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in 98 patients in the early stage of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with the purpose of testing the feasibility and justifiability of a large clinical trial on such therapy. The results of the study were as follows. (1) The randomization in this study was quite satisfactory. The interruption of the treatment protocol for more than 24 hours and the patients drop out rate were only 5.1% each, and no side effects of captopril were observed. These indicated that such study could be carried out on large scale. (2) Captopril slightly lowered blood pressure (average 10.2/4.5mm Hg after 2 hours of oral 6.25mg) with minimal change of heart rate, but it did not increase the incidence of sustained hypotension. (3) Captopril decreased the angiotensin II level significantly after 2 hours of ingesting 12.5mg. (4) Early captopril treatment tended to reduce the incidence of cardiac free wall rupture, the severity of congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock, therefore tended to reduce the early mortality of AMI (3/43 captopril group VS 8/55 placebo group).", 
    "414": "Twenty-four patients were studied to assess the efficacy and principle of indapamide in hypertensive patients previously treated and unsatisfactorily controlled with either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or atenolol therapy. The result showed a satisfactory anti-hypertensive effect of indapamide. Plasma phosphate concentrations were markedly reduced and no significant variance in plasma K+, Na+ and Ca+ concentration after two weeks of indapamide therapy (2.5 mg, one day). Thus indapamideinduced reduction of blood pressure could be mediated by an effect of this drug on phosphate balance.", 
    "415": "Hearts from untreated or enalapril-treated piglets were used to measure rates of ribosome formation and total protein synthesis during perfusion as modified Langendorff preparations. Pretreatment of newborn piglets with enalapril maleate (5 mg, once daily for 3 days) resulted in a decreased rate of growth of the left ventricle. Addition of 1 microM angiotensin II to the perfusate had no effect on in vitro ribosome formation or protein synthesis in either the right or left ventricle of hearts from untreated or enalapril-treated piglets. Angiotensin II receptor number or affinity in the left ventricle was not decreased by enalapril treatment. In contrast, addition of combinations of 1 microM norepinephrine and 1 microM propranolol or 1 microM phenylephrine and 1 microM propranolol to the perfusate restored the rate of ribosome formation in the left ventricle of hearts from enalapril-treated piglets to that observed in the left ventricle of hearts from untreated piglets. Prazosin (100 nM) blocked the stimulatory effect of either norepinephrine or phenylephrine on ribosome formation in the left ventricle. Binding of [3H] prazosin to membranes from the left ventricle was unaltered by pretreatment of the piglet with enalapril maleate. Pretreatment of piglets with prazosin (1 mg, twice daily for 3 days) resulted in a small but significant decrease in mean arterial pressure as well as the rate of left ventricular growth. Pretreatment of piglets with hydralazine (10 mg, twice daily for 3 days) significantly reduced mean arterial pressure but did not alter left ventricular growth. These results support a role for alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation in the regulation of neonatal cardiac growth.", 
    "416": "Ten to 15 years ago, the thrust of research in the treatment of congestive heart failure centered around finding new inotropic agents. While initially useful, these agents given chronically actually accelerated left ventricular failure and were associated with excess mortality. Recently, it has been learned that altering the body's response to heart failure is more beneficial compared to attempts to stimulate left ventricular inotropic function. Such altering of the neurohumoral responses to heart failure has been associated with improvements in both morbidity and mortality.", 
    "417": "The following topically-applied thiols were investigated with regard to their possible UV-radiation protective properties: captopril, cysteamine, ergothioneine, mesna, mercaptopropionylglycine, N-acetyl-cysteine and penicillamine. As a measure for protection the inhibition of in vivo irreversible photobinding of the labelled phototoxic drugs chlorpromazine (CPZ) and 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) to rat epidermal biomacromolecules was used. Ergothioneine, mesna and penicillamine did not show any effect; probably, as a result of their charge they are not able to enter the stratum corneum. Captopril, cysteamine, mercaptopropionylglycine and N-acetylcysteine showed a considerable inhibition of CPZ and 8-MOP photobinding. Captopril and N-acetylcysteine were clearly the most potent whereas cysteamine was the least effective. Captopril, mercaptopropionylglycine and N-acetylcysteine appeared to have a wider action range and to be a more effective protector than dl-alpha-tocopherol and di-butyl-hydroxytoluene. Cysteamine and mercaptopropionylglycine were only capable of protecting the stratum corneum. Captopril and N-acetylcysteine on the other hand showed an additional dose-dependent inhibition of photobinding to the viable epidermis. Gradually with increasing time after application, the protecting efficacy with regard to the viable layer of the epidermis decreased; the duration of protection depending on the dose.", 
    "418": "The effect of enalapril and terazosin on serum lipid profile was investigated in 36 patients with primary hypertension and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 5.2 mmol l). 6- and 12-week monotherapy with these drugs did not produce any unfavourable changes in: total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A1 and B as well as in serum lipids. Enalapril and terazosin seem to be very useful as a first step monotherapy especially in patients with hypertension and lipid disturbances.", 
    "419": "To assess the effects of left ventricular mass reduction on the prevalence of ventricular ectopic activity, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial measuring ambulatory 48 h premature ventricular depolarizations in 27 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and an increased left ventricular mass index. Data was obtained at baseline and 6 +/- 2 months after randomization to either 25 mg captopril or placebo twice a day. Patients on captopril attained reduction in blood pressure from 167 +/- 11/103 +/- 6 to 136 +/- 10/85 +/- 5 mm Hg (P = .001), left ventricular mass index regression from 149 +/- 17 to 96 +/- 23 g/m2 (P = .001), and ventricular ectopic activity reduction from 413 +/- 172 to 77 +/- 27 ventricular extrasystoles/day (P = .001). Patients on placebo had no significant change in blood pressure (from 162 +/- 11/101 +/- 6 at baseline to 160 +/- 8/100 +/- 8 mm Hg after 6 months; P = NS). In the placebo group left ventricular mass index increased from 155 +/- 40 to 182 +/- 51 g/m2 (P = .01), and ventricular ectopic activity decreased from 634 +/- 293 to 562 +/- 260 ventricular extrasystoles/day (P = NS). Eight out of 14 patients on captopril (57%) and 1 out of 13 patients on placebo (8%) achieved reduction > 85% in ventricular ectopic activity per day (P = .004). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, left ventricular mass index regression and reduction in systolic blood pressure were the most important correlates for this effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "420": "The human heart is a target organ for the octapeptide hormone, angiotensin II (Ang II). Recent studies suggest that the human heart contains a dual pathway of Ang II formation in which the major Ang II-forming enzymes are angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase. Human heart chymase has recently been purified and its cDNA and gene cloned. This cardiac serine proteinase is the most efficient and specific Ang II-forming enzyme described. To obtain insights into the cardiac sites of chymase-dependent Ang II formation, we examined the cellular localization and regional distribution of chymase in the human heart. Electron microscope immunocytochemistry using an anti-human chymase antibody showed the presence of chymase-like immunoreactivity in the cardiac interstitium and in cytosolic granules of mast cells, endothelial cells, and some mesenchymal interstitial cells. In the cardiac interstitium, chymase-like immunoreactivity is associated with the extracellular matrix. In situ hybridization studies further indicated that chymase mRNA is expressed in endothelial cells and in interstitial cells, including mast cells. Tissue chymase levels were determined by activity assays and by Western blot analyses. Chymase levels were approximately twofold higher in ventricles than in atria. There were no significant differences in chymase levels in ventricular tissues obtained from non-failing donor hearts, failing ischemic hearts, or hearts from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. These findings suggest that a major site of chymase-dependent Ang II formation in the heart is the interstitium and that cardiac mast cells, mesenchymal interstitial cells, and endothelial cells are the cellular sites of synthesis and storage of chymase. In the human heart, because ACE levels are highest in the atria and chymase levels are highest in ventricles, it is likely that the relative contribution of ACE and chymase to cardiac Ang II formation varies with the cardiac chamber. Such differences may lead to differential suppression of cardiac Ang II levels during chronic ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "421": "The effects of captopril on systolic function and diastolic myocardial expansion were assessed in an open-chest multiple occlusion model of myocardial stunning. Captopril was given as a 0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion at 0.25 mg/kg/h for the duration of the stunning protocol, which was initiated 30 min after the bolus dose was given. The coronary artery was occluded for 5 min and reperfused for 10 min. This procedure was performed 12 times. Regional systolic function and end-diastolic length (EDL) in both the stunned region and normal zone were measured by sonomicrometry. Heart rate (HR) and left ventricular diastolic blood pressure (LVDP) were not significantly different between untreated (n = 11) and captopril-treated (n = 10) groups. The mean aortic pressure (MAP) in the captopril-treated group was approximately 10 mm Hg lower than in the untreated group, p < 0.05. Systolic function as determined by the percentage systolic shortening was significantly decreased to approximately 20% of baseline (preocclusion) function in both untreated and captopril treated groups as a result of the stunning procedure, p < 0.001. However, there was an important treatment effect on diastolic expansion of stunned myocardium. In the untreated group, the stunned myocardium underwent a 5-7% relative increase in end-diastolic length (expansion), p < 0.05. In the captopril-treated group, this expansion process was abolished. We conclude that in a multiple occlusion model of myocardial stunning, captopril had no effects in preserving systolic function but had favorable attributes in dilation and expansion of postischemic myocardium.", 
    "422": "The goal of the present study was to compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) and a long-acting calcium antagonist (Ro 40-5967) on cardiac remodeling secondary to renovascular hypertension. For this purpose, two kidney-one clip (2K-1C) hypertensive rats, 6 weeks after renal artery clipping, were either untreated or treated for 5 weeks with equihypotensive doses of enalapril (3 mg/kg/day) and Ro 40-5967 (30 mg/kg/day). At the end of the treatment period, cardiac weight, maximum coronary blood flow ([MCBF], measured in isolated perfused hearts), and interstitial and perivascular collagen volume fraction (measured by morphometry) were evaluated in all rats. Both drugs similarly decreased arterial blood pressure (ABP) for 24 h. Enalapril was more effective than Ro 40-5967 in inducing regression of cardiac hypertrophy. MCBF was decreased in untreated hypertensive rats and was increased to the same extent by both treatments, although not normalized. Interstitial cardiac collagen content after 11 weeks of hypertension was not increased in untreated hypertensive rats. In contrast, the collagen volume fraction measured in the perivascular area was increased in untreated hypertensive rats and this increase was not significantly suppressed by either enalapril or Ro 40-5967. These results show that cardiac hypertrophy, decrease in MCBF and increase in myocardial collagen content, do not evolve in parallel in 2K-1C hypertensive rats. Two antihypertensive treatments, enalapril and Ro 40-5967, increased MCBF to the same extent but had different effects on cardiac hypertrophy despite having equal antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "423": "We evaluated the effects of lisinopril (1 mg/kg per day) on hemodynamics, cardiac hypertrophy, and neurohumoral factors in Wistar rats with an abdominal aortocaval fistula. After 4 weeks of treatment, the results were compared with values obtained for untreated rats with a fistula and for sham-operated rats. Volume loading induced biventricular hypertrophy, hemodynamic signs of high-output heart failure (increased cardiac output, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and pulse pressure), and impaired renal function (decreased renal blood flow and kidney weight; increased blood urea nitrogen). Lisinopril did not affect these cardiorenal hemodynamics, but decreased left ventricular mass and mortality rate (both P < 0.05). Lisinopril attenuated the increase in plasma norepinephrine, and increased plasma renin activity (both P < 0.05). Thus, lisinopril reduced left ventricular mass and mortality in rats with high-output heart failure without changing the cardiorenal hemodynamics. Neurohumoral inhibition may play a role in the beneficial effects of lisinopril.", 
    "424": "An understanding of the important role of neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms in heart failure has been translated into therapeutic options that can improve cardiac function, alter disease progression, and improve survival. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are of proven benefit in this regard, and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists are potentially another such class of agents. By inhibiting the myocardial effects of chronic adrenergic activation, beta blocking agents may improve left ventricular function or delay its deterioration in patients with heart failure. Aside from blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, other ancillary properties inherent in third-generation beta-blocking agents (such as vasodilation) may exert additional favorable effects. Clinical data generated in subjects with heart failure indicate that beta-antagonist therapy exerts its physiologic and clinical effects through neurohormonal antagonism, generally analogous to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Virtually all controlled long-term studies show that beta-blocking agents improve cardiac function and hemodynamics in patients with chronic heart failure, but large-scale trials are needed to ascertain a favorable effect on the natural history of heart failure.",

The pre-steady-state analysis of this tight-binding inhibition showed it to be characterized by slow kinetics, but at variance with what was found for enalaprilat in the same conditions, idrapril appeared to act through a simple, single step mechanism. Kinetic Ki and k(on) and k(off) values were 470 pM, 3.0 +/- 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 sec-1 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3) sec-1, respectively.",

If the result of either test was abnormal, angiography was undertaken, followed immediately by angioplasty (if a stenosis was found) or by renal vein renin determinations. Patients whose blood pressures were lower 6 to 12 weeks after a revascularization procedure (surgery or angioplasty) were diagnosed as having renovascular hypertension.", 
    "428": "Of the 150 patients, 100 underwent angiography, and 59 had renal artery stenosis. Of 53 patients who had surgery (n = 21) or angioplasty (n = 32), 51 had lowered blood pressures compared with before the procedure. Sensitivity and specificity of the tests were as follows: renal scintigram with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: 92% and 91% (all patients) and 92% and 80% (only patients with angiograms); captopril challenge test: 76% and 82% (all patients) and 76% and 58% (only patients with angiograms). Little difference in accuracy rates was observed in subgroup analyses in patients with chronic renal impairment, previous diuretic or beta-blocker therapy, or bilateral renal artery stenosis.",

Noninvasive screening tests for renovascular hypertension can help to identify patients who should undergo angiography and often predict success after revascularization.", 
    "430": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, alacepril, on insulin sensitivity in patients with essential hypertension (EHT). Ten patients (5 men and 5 women) with EHT (3 with mild diabetes and 2 with borderline glucose tolerance) participated. We measured insulin sensitivity using the two-hour euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique and plasma glucose and insulin responses to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (75 g OGTT) before and after 6-8 weeks of treatment with alacepril (dose, 50 mg/day). Glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the last 30 min of the clamp study increased from 5.83 +/- 0.70 to 6.59 +/- 0.65 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute (P < 0.05) after treatment with alacepril. The insulin-sensitivity index, which was calculated by dividing the GIR by the mean insulin concentration during the same period of the clamp, also increased from 5.91 +/- 0.66 to 7.20 +/- 0.90 (P < 0.05) after treatment with alacepril. Plasma glucose responses to a 75 g OGTT were changed from diabetic pattern to borderline pattern in two patients and from borderline pattern to normal pattern in one patient after treatment with alacepril. Body weight did not significantly change throughout the study in any of the patients studied. Our study demonstrated that alacepril significantly improves insulin sensitivity in patients with EHT.", 
    "431": "A series of monoamidic derivatives of cis- and trans-1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic and 1,2-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acids bearing either a carboxylic, sulfhydrylic, or hydroxamic group in the side chain were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory activity against angiotensin converting enzyme. The compounds were designed as potential ACE inhibitors of novel structure, assuming that a monoamidic residue of an 1,2-cyclomethylenedicarboxylic acid could be an alternative structure to the acylproline moiety, the carboxyl-terminal portion common to various ACE inhibitors. The most active compounds were found in the hydroxamic derivatives of cyclohexane series; within this series of derivatives a marked increase of potency was caused by alkylation of the amidic nitrogen with a methyl or ethyl group. Therefore enantiomers of the selected hydroxamic derivatives of cis- and trans-1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid were prepared by two different chiral synthetic routes and evaluated in vitro for their ACE inhibitor potencies. The active enantiomers both of the cis series (21a, 21c) and trans series (16b, 16d) were found to have all R configuration at the C-2 and R or S configuration at the C-1, while in the classical ACE inhibitors S configuration at the terminal carboxylate (corresponding to the C-1 of our compounds) is strictly required for activity. The most potent compound of the series was (1S,2R)-cis-2[[[2-(hydroxyamino)-2-oxoethyl]methylamino]carbonyl] cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (21a) with an IC50 value of 7.0 nM compared with the value of 3.0 nM for captopril. Further 21a was shown to be highly selective and competitive ACE inhibitor. These results indicate that this non-amino acid structure of inhibitors meets the ACE active site requirements for the binding. The binding compatibility of the most active compounds with a model of ACE active site was evaluated by molecular modeling techniques.",

During an average follow-up of 42 months, these procedures were also performed more commonly in the United States than in Canada. These differences were not associated with any apparent difference in mortality (22 percent in Canada and 23 percent in the United States) or rate of reinfarction (14 percent in Canada and 13 percent in the United States), but there was a higher incidence of activity-limiting angina in Canada than in the United States (33 percent vs. 27 percent, P < 0.007).",

After a 4-week placebo period, patients were given 10 mg of enalapril for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks of therapy, patients were maintained on the same dose of enalapril, titrated to a higher dose of enalapril, or received combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide if their diastolic blood pressure remained > 90 mmHg. Patients in group 1 received enalapril 10 mg or 20 mg and those in group 2 received enalapril 10 mg alone or combined with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. The maintenance phase lasted 8 weeks. A standard mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure blood pressure at each visit. The mean decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was 16 mmHg in groups 1 and 2; the mean decrease in supine systolic blood pressure (SSBP) was 19 mmHg in group 1 and 20 mmHg in group 2. Eighty percent of the patients in group 1 and 81% of those in group 2 had an SDBP < or = 90 mmHg at the final visit. To achieve this control, 67% of the patients received enalapril 10 mg and 33% received enalapril 20 mg in group 1. In group 2, 70% of the patients received enalapril 10 mg and 30% received enalapril 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Eighteen patients in group 1 and 17 patients in group 2 experienced one or more minor adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, asthenia, abdominal pain, nausea, and dizziness. No major adverse events were observed. We conclude that enalapril used alone reduces blood pressure in the majority of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. When blood pressure is not controlled by enalapril alone, hydrochlorothiazide can safely be added to the regimen.", 
    "439": "Patients with stage I or II essential hypertension were assigned to receive 1 mg of cilazapril once daily in the morning (n = 11; mean age, 63 years); 2 mg of cilazapril once daily in the morning (n = 8; mean age, 60 years); or 1 mg of cilazapril twice daily (n = 9; mean age, 68 years). Blood pressure was recorded for 24 hours before treatment began and after 2 weeks of treatment. After all three doses of cilazapril, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower than before treatment. Greater reductions in blood pressure were found after 2 mg of cilazapril daily than 1 mg daily. The antihypertensive effect of cilazapril was greater during the daytime than during the night. When the blood pressure effect was analyzed by the cumulative percentage method, it was noted that, after the two once-daily regimens, the magnitude of the blood pressure reduction was greater at higher blood pressures and smaller at lower blood pressures. No such trend was apparent after the twice-daily dose of cilazapril.", 
    "440": "Neurohormonal mechanisms play an important role in pathogenesis of left ventricular dysfunction. Analysis of traditional therapeutic strategies for heart failure used in the past is disappointing. Recent therapeutic strategy that aims to treat earlier patients with ventricular dysfunction with agents that counteract neurohormonal activation, seems to be more effective. However conventional drugs such as vasodilator agents, digitalis and diuretics are still useful for treatment of overt heart failure, due to their proven hemodynamic benefits. A lot of current clinical trials, in the future, can help us to solve this problem. In this issue evolving concepts of pathophysiology of chronic heart failure and how these pathophysiologic concepts lead to the rational treatment are discussed.", 
    "441": "Erythropoietin (EPO)-induced hypertension is a common complication of EPO usage. The hypothesis that erythropoietin is antinatriuretic and that the sodium retention is mediated by intrarenal angiotensin II production was tested. Experiments were performed in Wistar rat kidneys perfused for 60 min in an isolated system. A dose-response curve was performed for EPO at 0, 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 mU/mL. EPO administration resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in sodium excretion to a maximum of 50% at the 1,000 mU/mL dose. In a second experiment, kidneys from five groups were perfused: controls, EPO (100 mU/mL), captopril (50 ng/mL), captopril (50 ng/mL) plus EPO (100 mU/mL), and the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan (1 nM) plus EPO (100 mU/mL). The administration of EPO resulted in an immediate decrease in average sodium excretion (30%) with no change in GFR or other renal function parameters. Pretreatment with captopril or losartan blocked the effect of EPO. Captopril alone had no effect on renal function. A final experiment demonstrated the ability of losartan (10 nM) to block the pressor effects of angiotensin II (0.01, 0.1, and 1 nM). It was concluded that EPO acts within the kidney to cause the production of angiotensin II, which mediates the increased reabsorption of sodium.", 
    "442": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used for controlling hypertension. Their use in women who are pregnant is not without risk to the fetus. We describe three infants exposed in utero to ACE inhibitors who had adverse outcomes. These cases, combined with other reports in the literature, suggest strongly that these drugs are fetotoxic. ACE inhibitor fetopathy is characterized by fetal hypotension, anuria-oligohydramnios, growth restriction, pulmonary hypoplasia, renal tubular dysplasia, and hypocalvaria. Although the true frequency of adverse fetal effects has yet to be determined, because of the debilitating and lethal nature of the fetal damage when it occurs, it is our recommendation that ACE inhibitors not be used in pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters.", 
    "443": "It was found that two known renal vasodilators had different effects on RBF and GFR in the setting of therapeutic blood levels of cyclosporine in hypertensive renal transplant patients. Captopril lowered blood pressure in these patients but also lowered blood flow and GFR. Nifedipine lowered blood pressure to the same degree but without lowering either RBF or GFR.", 
    "444": "Several recent reports have described a high incidence of anaphylactic reactions in patients being dialyzed with high-flux membranes while simultaneously using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Many of these reports implicate polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as the membrane commonly involved in these reactions. To elucidate potential mechanisms of these anaphylactic reactions, whether dialysis membranes can activate the Hageman factor-dependent (contact) pathways as assessed by the in vitro generation of activated Hageman factor (Hfa), as well as the formation of kallikrein and subsequent bradykinin generation was examined. Both cuprophane (CUP) and PAN membranes were able to activate Hageman factor and convert prekallikrein to kallikrein as measured by an ELISA against kallikrein-C1-inactivator complexes. Subsequently, the active kallikrein was able to cleave bradykinin from its endogenous substrate, high-molecular-weight kininogen. However, it was found that the PAN membrane consistently led to an earlier and significantly higher formation of Hfa and kallikrein when compared with CUP. Importantly, there was also a pronounced but transient generation of bradykinin by the PAN membrane, in contrast to slower bradykinin formation by CUP, with both normal and uremic blood. It was proposed that the early and vigorous bradykinin generation induced by the contact of blood with PAN could explain, in part, the pathogenesis of the reported anaphylactoid reactions.", 
    "445": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) can have multiple effects on the kidney, including influences on the regulation of glomerular hemodynamics and tubular transport as well as consequences for the glomerular processing of macromolecules. The recognized suppressive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on compensatory renal growth, even in the absence of hemodynamic effects, and the well-documented proliferative effect of ANG II on vascular smooth muscle cells have provided the background for the recent intensive interest in this peptide as a renal cytokine. Diverse cell types along the nephron express a variety of ANG II receptors. These receptors and their putative signal transduction pathways have been best characterized in mesangial and proximal tubular cells. Culture experiments provide convincing evidence that ANG II can be a phenotypic influence on these cell types. The growth responses and the associated signal transduction pathways, however, are different in mesangial and proximal tubular cells. These ANG II-mediated responses are also associated with an increase in the synthesis of distinct collagen subtypes, potentially linking the growth stimulatory effects of ANG II to the irreversible changes of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis observed in chronic renal failure. Preventing the intrarenal actions of ANG II with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or with the new, orally active, selective ANG II receptor antagonists may provide a rational therapeutic approach to attenuate the progression of a variety of kidney diseases.", 
    "446": "Forty patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension were studied. They received daily doses of either 240 mg verapamil or 10 mg enalapril, as well as a placebo. Total duration of trial was 24 weeks: a \"washout\" period of 2 weeks, a treatment period of 6 weeks with one of the two drugs, another \"washout\" period of 2 weeks, and another treatment period of 6 weeks with the alternate drug. Those patients with persistence of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 90 mmHg received simultaneously both drugs for an additional period of 8 weeks. Patients were assigned alternately to one of the groups. When each drug was given during the first treatment period, DBP was reduced below 90 mmHg in 15 of 19 patients receiving verapamil, and in 12 of 20 that received enalapril. When the drugs were given during the second treatment period, DBP became normal in 16 of 19 patients receiving enalapril, and in all the 18 patients treated with verapamil. Three patients achieved normal DBP when received simultaneously both drugs. Two patients withdrew from the trial for personal reasons and one for experimenting cough as reaction to enalapril. There were no other undesirable side effects. Laboratory tests did not show changes. Both products were similarly effective. Synergy was shown by the improvement of patients unresponsive to either drug when given singly, but responding when both were given simultaneously.", 
    "447": "Atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects is improved by the reduced repair capacity of endothelial damage and by the increased platelet aggregation, peculiar to diabetic pathology. The contemporary presence of high blood pressure, diabetes and lipoidoproteinosis, increasing the possibility of cardiovascular damage, also under well-controlled blood pressure values, certainly increases the risk of atherosclerosis. However we have valued the presence of lipoidoproteinosis in 52 of our diabetic-hypertensive patients in a follow-up of 40 months. The patients have been split in to two groups of 26 patients each, one being treated with nifedipine, the other to with captopril. The data obtained have been compared with the data for the two control groups (non diabetic patients). The selection has been carried out according to established criteria. We have investigated: glycaemia, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, tot. Chol./HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C. During follow-up the blood pressure values were significantly reduced (p < 0.01) (captopril: delta SBP = -13.88, delta DBP = -12.38, nifedipine: delta SBP = -22.03, delta DBP = -21.35). In the nifedipine group lipoidoproteinosis has been more marked: delta% glicaemia = +17.69, delta% cholesterolemia = +20.11; delta% CFR = +18.57; LDL-C = +35.11; delta% VRF = +34.61, while in the patients treated with captopril we have had the following results: delta% glycaemia = +15.43; delta% cholesterolemia = +16.36; delta% LDL-C = +26.68. The control group with nifedipine treatment have shown only increased values of cholesterolemia: delta% = +4.80, moreover in the control group treated with captopril we have observed a reduction of VRF: delta% = -15. A significant relationship between total cholesterolemia and glycaemia in the group with nifedipine treatment (p < 0.01) and captopril (p < 0.01) has been reported. This study could appear to underline the autonomic nervous system activation by nifedipine which does not affect lipoidoproteinosis in diabetic hypertensive subjects. This would seem to confirm on the contrary, the utility of captopril in the treatment of atherosclerotic subjects, as diabetic hypertensive patients.", 
    "448": "The response to the therapy with captopril administered in one daily dose (between 25 and 100 mg) to a group of 468 old patients with arterial hypertension has been studied. In 87% of the cases, normalization of the arterial pressure was achieved at six months (values lower than 160/95 mmHg). The therapy resulted in a progressive reduction during the follow-up period, with a significant initial reduction (p < 0.001). Just 7.5% of the patients needed the administration of diuretics in addition to the therapy. Just nine patients had to discontinue the follow-up due to side effects (dry cough in 4; gastrointestinal disorders in 4; postural hypertension in 1 case). We conclude that captopril administered in one daily dose is a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate arterial hypertension among the elderly.", 
    "449": "Importance of systolic over diastolic blood pressure measurements: Systolic pressure is known to be a more important independent cardiovascular risk factor than diastolic pressure in subjects over 50 years of age; after that age, a high incidence of two types of systolic hypertension is observed, sustained essential hypertension with a disproportionate increase in systolic pressure and isolated systolic hypertension. Effects of lacidipine on blood pressure in the elderly: The effects of vasodilators on blood pressure have been studied extensively. Recently, lacidipine, nitrendipine and enalapril were compared in a multicenter, randomly allocated, double-blind trial in elderly hypertensive patients with a disproportionate increase in systolic pressure treated for 8 weeks (n = 278). In these patients, supine systolic pressure decreased to a greater extent with lacidipine and enalapril than with nitrendipine, the difference between lacidipine and nitrendipine reaching statistical significance. In another trial, lisinopril produced a greater reduction in systolic pressure than atenolol. Finally, in a study in elderly patients with systolic hypertension, long-acting isosorbide dinitrate induced a selective sustained decrease in systolic pressure. Mechanisms of action of vasodilators: A fall in systolic blood pressure may be produced by vasodilators through a reduction in peripheral resistance with or without an active change in arterial compliance. Dihydralazine-like substances do not increase arterial compliance whereas angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium entry blockers and nitrates tend to increase arterial compliance for the same decrease in mean arterial pressure.", 
    "450": "The acute effects of three doses of captopril (12.5, 25, and 50 mg [approximately 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg]) on several haemodynamic variables and plasma aldosterone concentration were investigated in four dogs with experimentally produced heart failure (rapid ventricular pacing) and one dog with dilated cardiomyopathy. Haemodynamic variables were measured with a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter and an indwelling carotid artery catheter at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 h after drug administration. A statistically significant (P < 0.05) decrease in peripheral vascular resistance was observed 1 and 2 h following the 12.5 mg dose. A significant and large enough decrease in peripheral vascular resistance to produce a significant decrease in mean systemic arterial blood pressure was observed 1 and 2 h after administering 25 and 50 mg of captopril. A mild but significant increase in cardiac output was observed 1 h after each dose. The drug effect on systemic arterial blood pressure lasted less than 4 h. No statistically significant changes were observed for the group in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right atrial blood pressure, or plasma aldosterone concentration at any time. We conclude that the acute haemodynamic benefits provided by captopril administration were mild and due primarily to arteriolar dilation. Doses of approximately 1-2 mg/kg produced slightly greater arteriolar dilation than an approximate dose of 0.5 mg/kg. The drug effect was short-lived, lasting less than 4 h.", 
    "451": "We have studied by morphometric procedures the chronic effect of captopril on the subfornical organ (SFO) and area postrema (AP) of the adult mouse. Oral administration of captopril does not produce any change in the size of individual nuclei of the ependymocytes and neurons in both centers. However, there are other quantitative effects of captopril on the global volume of the SFO and on the neuropil and vascular elements of both the SFO and AP which present a significant increase. It is suggested that this increase is due to metabolic processes at the level of both circumventricular organs.", 
    "452": "Forty-three consecutive patients who were being treated with digitalis, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics were evaluated for orthotopic heart transplantation. After right heart catheterization in patients with more than 3 Wood units or with a mean pulmonary artery pressure higher than 30 mm Hg (n = 13; group 1), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) therapy was initiated at a dosage of 5 ng/kg/min and was increased stepwise (mean maintenance dosage, 35 ng/kg/min) until side effects (joint pain, digital edema) occurred. After 6 days of PGE1 administration, dosage decreased stepwise. One week after PGE1 was stopped, right heart recatheterization was performed, and the patients were listed on the waiting list. Hemodynamic data significantly improved in PGE1-treated patients. Patients without pulmonary hypertension (group 2, n = 30) were put directly on the waiting list. No oversized or local donor was required for transplantation. Eight of 13 patients in group 1 underwent transplantation. The other five patients died while on the waiting list. In group 2, 15 patients underwent transplantation, and 15 patients died while on the waiting list. A prolonged mean survival time on the waiting list (6.0 versus 3.1 months, p < 0.005) was noticed in group 1. PGE1 was administered after orthotopic heart transplantation whenever indicated; no death was related to right ventricular failure in group 1. The results after orthotopic heart transplantation in patients treated with PGE1 were comparable to the control group. PGE1 therapy enabled us to perform orthotopic heart transplantation on patients with pulmonary hypertension at a comparable risk with normal heart transplant recipients.",

    "456": "There is no simple screening test for renovascular hypertension that can be applied to an unselected population of hypertensive subjects. The diagnosis depends on judicious use of non-invasive screening tests in those subjects in whom one suspects, on clinical grounds, that there may be an underlying renovascular lesion. Captopril renography and duplex scanning of renal arteries are the most reliable non-invasive screening tests. A team approach with collaboration of hypertension specialist/vascular physician, vascular surgeon and experienced interventional radiologist is important for rational management and we would emphasise the importance of audit procedures.", 
    "457": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was evaluated for its antimutagenic potential. Male Swiss albino mice (6-8 wk old) were treated orally with different doses of captopril dissolved in water for 7 days. Some of the mice in each group were injected ip with adriamycin (ADM; 15 mg/kg body weight) and killed after 30 hr. Femoral cells of mice were collected and studied for reduction of micronuclei. Proteins, RNA and DNA were determined in hepatic cells. Captopril pretreatment was found to reduce ADM-induced micronuclei in polychromatic cells and increase the quantity of protein, RNA and DNA in hepatic cells. The inhibition of clastogenicity observed may be due to free-radical scavenging action of captopril.", 
    "458": "Studies on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the anterior pituitary gland have shown that it is synthesized locally, physiologically regulated, and may act as a paracrine/autocrine factor. We have now investigated the regulation of anterior pituitary VIP gene expression in rats during osmotic stimulation. Both salt-loading and dehydration resulted in a progressive and marked reduction in VIP mRNA levels as determined by Northern analysis, to 10% of control levels at 14 days of salt-loading. The 1.7 and 1.0 kb VIP RNA transcripts were equally affected. Since anterior pituitary VIP is partially localized in lactotrophs we also measured prolactin (PRL) mRNA levels. In contrast to VIP, PRL mRNA levels were increased during both osmotic paradigms, the mRNA levels being significantly raised after 5 days of salt-loading to 130% of controls. Further experiments, conducted to examine the mechanism by which VIP gene expression is down-regulated during osmotic stimulation, demonstrated that dopamine and angiotensin II do not appear to be involved. The results show dissociated regulation of VIP and PRL during osmotic stimulation and provide suggestive evidence of a role for anterior pituitary VIP in the animal's osmoregulatory responses. VIP may therefore be a paracrine factor with diverse functional roles.", 
    "459": "A combination of dietary sodium restriction (40 mmol day-1) and frusemide pretreatment has been used to activate the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in order to characterise the haemodynamic and hormonal responses to enalapril in young normotensives. Enalapril significantly reduced supine blood pressure with a mean maximum fall of 19 +/- 7.6, compared with 6.5 +/- 6.8 mm Hg with placebo. Similar but greater responses were seen in erect blood pressure. Mean maximal plasma ACE inhibition (78 +/- 5.7%) was associated with a significant increase in PRA from 5.2 +/- 2.1 ngAI ml-1 h-1 to a peak of 29.1 +/- 6 ngAI ml-1 h-1. This simple well tolerated regimen produced consistent RAS activation and gave readily measurable falls in blood pressure following enalapril. This model may be used to undertake detailed assessments of ACE inhibition, renin inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade.", 
    "460": "1. To examine whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prevents left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy even in low-renin hypertension, we studied the effect of the administration of perindopril on cardiac hypertrophy induced by partial renal ablation in hypertensive rats. 2. Rats that had undergone partial nephrectomy were randomly divided into four groups that received the following as drinking water: Group A, tap water; Group B, 1% sodium chloride (NaCl); Group C, NaCl + perindopril 3 mg/kg per day; and Group D, NaCl + perindopril 1 mg/kg per day. Plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin-II (AII) concentration and cardiac tissue AII were measured. 3. Supplementation of NaCl following nephrectomy increased the blood pressure and cardiac weight compared with rats that had undergone nephrectomy alone (P < 0.05). Treatment with perindopril (3 mg/kg per day) did not affect the blood pressure and plasma AII but inhibited the increase of cardiac weight (P < 0.05). Left ventricular AII was decreased in cases of reduced renal mass hypertension, but was not changed by treatment with perindopril. 4. These results demonstrate that perindopril may be able to prevent LV hypertrophy even in low-renin hypertension, which was not mediated by a reduction of blood pressure or suppression of the circulating and cardiac renin-angiotensin systems. Other mechanisms of ACE inhibitors may contribute to the cardioprotective effects.", 
    "461": "1. Conscious, Long Evans rats were chronically instrumented with pulsed Doppler flow probes and intravascular catheters to allow regional haemodynamic (coeliac, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds) responses to i.v. bradykinin to be assessed in the absence and presence of captopril and of ganglion blockade (with mecamylamine). 2. Bradykinin (3 nmol kg-1, i.v. bolus) had no effect on mean arterial blood pressure, although it caused hyperaemic vasodilatation in the coeliac, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. Following administration of captopril at a dose (28 nmol kg-1) which had no effect on responses to angiotensin I, the hypotensive and coeliac and mesenteric vasodilator responses to bradykinin were enhanced. However, there was a temporal dissociation between these events indicating that changes in cardiac output must have been contributing to the changes in mean arterial blood pressure. 3. Captopril at a higher dose (280 nmol kg-1) caused reversible inhibition of the pressor and coeliac and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin I, but the inhibition of the mesenteric vascular responses was significantly less than that of the coeliac vascular responses. Under the same conditions, the mesenteric vasodilator effects of bradykinin were less enhanced than the coeliac vasodilator effects, consistent with greater inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (i.e., kininase II) in the coeliac than in the mesenteric vascular bed. But, since the hypotensive action of bradykinin was markedly enhanced in these circumstances, the possibility existed that baroreflex responses influenced the haemodynamic effects of bradykinin. However, assessment of the haemodynamic changes following bradykinin administration(bolus or infusion) in the presence of ganglion blockade showed that only the hindquarters vasodilator response to bradykinin was enhanced, while the coeliac and mesenteric vasodilator responses were diminished. Thus, additional factors must have been influencing the latter responses.4. The results show that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II) can have differential effects on the regional haemodynamic responses to angiotensin I and bradykinin. The results provide a striking illustration of our previous assertion that the measurement of arterial blood pressure alone cannot provide sufficient information to allow interpretation either of the effects of vasoactive substances,or of the influence of drugs thereupon.", 
    "462": "Abnormalities in the response of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) to volume expansion have been reported in hypertensive-prone animals and men as well as in hypertensive patients undergoing ACE-inhibition. To investigate some of the mechanisms affecting ANF release in borderline hypertensive patients (BHT) we have studied 16 subjects by assessing their neuro-humoral and hemodynamic response to a two-hour isotonic i.v. NaCl infusion carried out during short-term administration of either placebo or captopril. ACE-inhibition increased baseline venous distensibility (VV30:1.4 vs 1.6 ml/100 ml; p < .05) and reduced the prompt (45') ANF response to saline loading (10.3 +/- 13 vs 42.7 +/- 15%; p < .05)) without affecting the overall ANF release (120':92 +/- 25 vs 65.8 +/- 20%; NS)). A significant pressor increase in response to NaCl loading was observed exclusively after ACE-inhibition (SBP: 5.2 +/- 2 vs 2.4 +/- 1%; p < .05--DBP: 7.1 +/- 3 vs 2 +/- 3%; p < .025) and occurred along with a peripheral arterial and venous constriction and with an increase in plasma levels of an endogeneous Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor (8.8 +/- 4 vs -2 +/- 4%; p < .05). We conclude that the ANF response to saline infusion is delayed by ACE-inhibition in borderline hypertensives. The abnormalities observed in ANF response could follow the changes in peripheral venous distensibility and contribute to the pressor and neuro-humoral derangements described in borderline hypertensives during volume expansion.", 
    "463": "A case of renin-secreting juxtaglomerular cell tumour which presented with a severe hypertensive crisis and did not respond to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors but was promptly controlled by intravenous labetalol is reported. The diagnostic difficulties which can be encountered in such cases and the usefulness of the different diagnostic tests, including renal vein renin measurement, are discussed.", 
    "464": "The aim of this study was to investigate possible abnormalities in salivary electrolytes in hypertensives treated with ace-inhibitors (ACE-I) or calcium antagonists (Ca-ANT) at low or normal sodium intake. Hypertensives treated with ACE-I (n.14) or Ca-ANT (n.22) and 13 normotensives were studied during normal or restricted Na intake. Na, K, Ca, Mg and Cl were determined in saliva samples collected by using a standardized adsorption procedure (SALIVETTE). Na intake was evaluated by determination of the 24-hr urinary Na excretion. Similar concentrations of Na, K, Ca, and Cl were found in normotensives and in hypertensives treated with ACEI or Ca-ANT both at low or normal Na diet. Magnesium in saliva appeared reduced in ACEI-treated hypertensives (0.28 +/- 0.06 mmol/l) in comparison to the similar values of normotensives (0.53 +/- 0.05) and Ca-ANT treated hypertensives (0.54 +/- 0.07). In normotensives and in treated hypertensives lowering of Na intake did not change the salivary content of Ca, Mg and Cl but produced in saliva a reduction of Na associated to a rise in K. Salivary Na/K ratio was significantly correlated with 24 hr urinary Na excretion in normotensives (r = 0.77; p < 0.05) and in hypertensives treated with ACE-I (r = 0.74; p < 0.05) or Ca-ANT (r = 0.62; p < 0.05). The low salivary magnesium in ACE-I-HT may have a role in the occasional ACEI-dependent dysgeusia. Salivary Na/K ratio may be used as a rough index of Na intake in treated hypertensives.", 
    "465": "Fifty-two black men who had supine diastolic blood pressures (DBP) above 95 mm Hg at the end of a 2-week placebo wash-out period were randomized to receive either isradipine SRO at 2.5 mg/day or enalapril at 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. After 4 weeks, the dosages were doubled if DBP remained above 90 mm Hg. Reductions in blood pressure were comparable in both groups. Mean supine DBP was reduced from 100.6 to 93.9 mm Hg in the isradipine-treated group, and from 103.9 to 98.2 mm Hg in the enalapril-treated group. At the end of the study, 24/27 patients were taking 5 mg isradipine SRO once daily, and 20/25 patients were taking 20 mg enalapril once daily. There were no serious adverse events. The results of this study indicated that monotherapy with isradipine SRO at the recommended initial dosage of 5 mg once daily is appropriate in black patients with hypertension. This was, however, not the case with enalapril at 10 mg once daily. The concurrent administration of a diuretic with enalapril may be more appropriate.", 
    "466": "The new slow-release oral formulation (SRO) of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was evaluated in 57 patients who had moderate-to-severe hypertension following a 2-week wash-out period and a 2-week placebo period. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril, at a dose of 6 mg/day, was added to the treatment of those not responding to 5 mg/day isradipine SRO alone. After 4 weeks of active treatment, isradipine alone normalized blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) in 38 (66.6%) patients whereas a further 4 weeks of treatment with the combination of isradipine and spirapril led to normalization in 14 of the 19 (73.7%) patients with partial or nil blood pressure responses. Side-effects were mild and transient and were observed in nine patients (15.8%). Isradipine SRO is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent and combination with spirapril appears to enhance its efficacy without an increase in side-effects.", 
    "467": "The antihypertensive effect of isradipine was studied in 35 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients (mean age 57 years) using casual and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure measurement. After the placebo phase, oral treatment was started with 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily for 4 weeks, which was increased to 2.5 mg twice daily if blood pressure was not normalized [in one patient, the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril was added at a dose of 3 mg daily after 4 weeks]. The active-treatment period lasted 24 weeks. At the end of therapy, casual blood pressure decreased significantly (P < .001) from 174/103 to 151/86 mm Hg, and mean ambulatory blood pressure from 145/88 to 139/84 mm Hg (P < .05). The total number of hypertensive systolic and diastolic blood pressure values also decreased. When patients were divided into normotensives and hypertensives according to their initial ambulatory blood pressure, no effect of treatment was detected in the normotensive group. Casual blood pressure was higher than the 24-h ambulatory pressure.", 
    "468": "This multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of 1 year's duration compared the safety and efficacy of isradipine, methyldopa, and placebo in 368 men, aged 40 to 65 years, with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Initial treatment with isradipine (1.25 mg twice daily), methyldopa (250 mg twice daily), or placebo was started after a wash-out and single-blind placebo period. If normotension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 95 mm Hg] was not achieved, doses were doubled. If the maximum dose as monotherapy did not result in normotension, captopril (25 mg or, if necessary, 50 mg, once daily) was added to the treatments of the three patient groups. Despite the marked placebo effect during the first 2 weeks of treatment, monotherapy with isradipine resulted in a higher rate of normalization (more than 64%) compared with 50% in the methyldopa group and 36% in the placebo group. Adding captopril to the treatments of non-responders increased the rate of normalization to 90% in the isradipine group, 84% in the methyldopa group, and 75% in the placebo group. Twenty-one patients dropped-out and 70 patients discontinued the study, the majority because of a lack of efficacy and adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions reported were cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complaints, headaches, and sleep and sexual disorders, mostly by patients taking methyldopa. Isradipine was well tolerated and the side-effects were minimal. These results indicate that isradipine is superior to methyldopa and, whether as monotherapy or in combination with captopril, highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "469": "The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of 1.25 to 2.5 mg of isradipine twice daily in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, as seen in general practice. A total of 595 patients were treated for 6 months with an initial dose of isradipine at 1.25 mg twice daily. This dose was doubled if normotension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < or = 90 mm Hg) was not achieved after 4 weeks of treatment (n = 327). If, after 8 weeks, blood pressure was still not normalized, either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril at 3 mg (n = 58) or the beta-blocker pindolol at 5 mg (n = 54) was added to the treatment. After 24 weeks, the mean blood pressure decrease with isradipine at 1.25 mg twice daily was 28.5/19.0 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP)/DBP and, with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily, 28.4/18.5 mm Hg. There was no relevant change in heart rate. The overall normalization rate for all 595 patients was 78.2%. Side-effects that were considered related or possibly related to treatment were reported in 73 patients (12.3%). Treatment with isradipine plus either spirapril or pindolol was discontinued in 32 patients (5.4%) because of side-effects related, or possibly related, to the study treatment. Blood pressure was also self-recorded in a subgroup of 45 patients. The self-recorded values were 11/6 mm Hg (SBP/DBP) lower than the respective causal readings at the start of active treatment. However, this difference disappeared completely after 8 weeks of treatment.",

Following a 4-week placebo run-in, 143 patients entered a 12-week double-blind multicenter study. Patients were randomized to receive either isradipine (n = 72) or felodipine (n = 71) at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. Dose-doubling and the addition of enalapril (2.5 mg once daily) was permitted if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > 90 mm Hg at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. Isradipine reduced blood pressure from 165/104 +/- 13/6 mm Hg at baseline to 144/88 +/- 13/8 mm Hg at week 12 (P < .001) whereas felodipine reduced blood pressure from 171/104 +/- 17/6 mm Hg at baseline to 150/92 +/- 19/9 mm Hg at week 12 (P < .001). Similar incidences of headache, flushing, dizziness and tachycardia were reported in both groups. However, the incidence of ankle edema was significantly lower in the isradipine group (14% v 30%) (P = .028). It is concluded that isradipine represents a practical improvement over felodipine in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "471": "The association between hypertension and atherosclerosis is complex, incorporating endothelial dysfunction, abnormalities of insulin and lipid metabolism, altered vascular biology, and impaired arterial compliance. Results of experimental and human studies suggest that there is heterogeneity in the manifestations of disease and responses to therapy among different animal species, vascular territories, and individual patients. Antihypertensive therapy requires the careful selection of specific agents that reduce blood pressure and preferentially and positively modulate the synergistic interaction of the many facets of disease, with the goal of preventing or regressing atherosclerosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and alpha-blockers appear to hold the greatest promise in this regard.", 
    "472": "Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an adaptive response to the increased load imposed on the heart in patients with hypertension, it ultimately is itself a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The influence of LVH on left ventricular function and on the coronary circulation, and the occurrence of serious ventricular arrhythmias are the major mechanisms of this increased risk. There is no doubt that regression of LVH occurs, but there are clear differences in this respect among antihypertensive drugs: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists produce the best response. Whether regression of LVH also causes an improvement in left ventricular function is unclear; various studies using the same drugs have yielded contradictory results. Furthermore, it has yet to be determined whether regression of LVH has a positive influence on the long-term prognosis in such patients; the results of the European Multicenter Study OvA will help in shedding more light on this important question.", 
    "473": "The uptake kinetics of cephradine, an amino-beta-lactam antibiotic, were studied in rat and rabbit intestinal brush border membrane vesicles preparations using both the Ca2+ and the Mg2+ methods of preparation, in the presence of an inward proton gradient. The Ca2+ method demonstrated greater uptake of cephradine in intestinal brush border vesicles prepared from both rat and rabbit and was used for these studies. The transport was observed to be of Michaelis-Menten carrier-mediated type with a passive transport component. The kinetic parameters obtained were as follows: for rat and rabbit, respectively, Km, 1.6 and 1.9 mM; Jmax', 1.7 and 20.7 nmol/mg/min; Pc' (= Jmax'/Km), 1.1 and 10.9 microL/mg/min; and Pm', 0.4 and 0.8 microL/mg/min. The kinetic parameters for the rat vesicles are consistent with those from our previous perfusion study using a conversion factor of 0.71 cm2/mg protein. The rabbit vesicles exhibited a similar Michaelis constant and a 10-fold larger maximal transport velocity, suggesting a quantitative advantage for the study of carrier-mediated transport in the rabbit compared to rat vesicles from the intestine. Cephradine uptake was inhibited by phenylpropionylproline, a proline derivative, and enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, which do not have an alpha-amino group, as well as dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino-beta-lactam antibiotics in both rat and rabbit vesicles. These results support the suggestion that they share the same peptide carrier pathway for oral absorption and that the vesicles may be a useful tool in developing orally effective peptide-type drugs.", 
    "474": "The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of Duplex scanning in detecting renovascular disease and to compare it with angiography, renal scintigraphy and captopril test for plasma renin activity and isotopic renography. A Duplex scan was performed in 92 renal arteries (46 patients) and compared to angiography. Three degrees of stenoses were established: 0-60%, 61-99% and occlusion. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the renal artery and its ratio to the peak velocity in the aorta (RAR) were used to discriminate stenoses > 60%. PSV in the interlobar arteries was used to assess the relative perfusion of both parenchyma. Angiography demonstrated a stenoses > 60% in 23 hypertensive patients. In all of the patients, plasma renin activity was measured and isotopic renograms (pre- and post-captopril) obtained in order to discriminate hypertension of vascular origin. A PSV in the renal artery > 210 cm/s and a RAR > 3.5 were found to be the diagnostic criteria with the best sensitivity and specificity in detecting stenoses > 60%. Based on these data, Duplex correctly identified 49/54 stenoses > 60%; 28/33 stenoses < 60%; and 5/5 occlusions (kappa 0.79). Sensitivity and specificity in detecting stenoses > 60% were 89.5 and 90.7%, respectively. The ratio between PSV in the interlobar arteries of both parenchyma accurately predicted the relative perfusion (ratio between DTPA uptake in both kidneys) in the isotopic test (n = 23, r = 0.91, p = 0.001). The captopril test (for plasma renin activity and isotopic renography) was positive in only five patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "475": "Arterial hypertension occurs frequently in patients with chronic renal failure. Antihypertensive treatment of arterial hypertension with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to be effective with a low incidence of adverse effects compared with other drug classes. Furthermore, treatment with ACE inhibitors may slow the progression of renal function impairment in certain groups of patients, such as those with diabetes. Most ACE inhibitors are prodrugs which are converted by hepatic esterolysis to an active diacid metabolite. Only captopril and lisinopril have sufficient oral bioavailability and are given as active drugs. ACE inhibitors can be subdivided into 3 classes with regard to the active group: the majority of ACE inhibitors are carboxyl-containing drugs, a new class of ACE inhibitors possess a phosphoryl-group and captopril and related compounds are sulfhydryl-containing drugs. The predominant elimination pathway of ACE inhibitors is excretion via the kidneys. Therefore, renal insufficiency is associated with reduced elimination of most ACE inhibitors and, thus, altered pharmacokinetic properties. This is most evident in chronic renal failure when glomerular filtration rates (GFR) are < 30 to 40 ml/min (1.8 to 2.4 L/h). As renal clearance decreases, the peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the active drugs or diacids are increased and time to peak concentrations and half-life are prolonged. However, there are large between-drug differences in the changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, resulting in different degrees of drug accumulation after consecutive administration. This leads, for example, to high accumulation rates for drugs such as lisinopril, or cilazaprilat. In contrast, fosinopril, which is also excreted to a large extent by the hepatobiliary pathway, does not seem to accumulate in renal failure. In general, pharmacokinetics and conversion of prodrugs seem to be slightly affected in chronic renal failure; however, these changes do not appear to be clinically relevant. Efficiency of clearance for prodrugs or active drugs and their respective metabolites by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis varies considerably. For some ACE inhibitors, such as captopril or enalapril, the high elimination fraction by haemodialysis necessitates a supplemental dose after dialysis. Other ACE inhibitors, such as quinapril or cilazapril, are only poorly eliminated by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Dosage recommendations for treatment with ACE inhibitors in chronic renal failure depend on the specific pharmacokinetic properties of the various agents. For most ACE inhibitors, dosage adjustment is recommended in moderate and severe impairment of renal function, with resultant dosages being 25 to 50% of those recommended for patients with normal renal function.",

Over the first 10 hours captopril reduced mean arterial pressure by 12.1 (2.4) mm Hg compared with 3.8 (1.9) mm Hg in the placebo group. No patient had to be withdrawn from the captopril group because of hypotension. From day 1 onwards systolic and diastolic arterial pressures in the captopril treated group were slightly but not significantly lower than on placebo. There was no difference in the incidence of ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia with treatment. Captopril prevented the day 3 peak in angiotensin II that occurred in the placebo group (peak concentration (interquartile range): 10.1 (4.8-19.4) pg/ml v 16.8 (4.3-46.3) pg/ml)) but had no effect on atrial natriuretic factor, arginine vasopressin, or catecholamines. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor remained above normal in both groups at two months after infarction. After one year left ventricular volume indices had increased less on captopril than on placebo: left ventricular end systolic volume index 5.4 ml/m2 v 14.7 ml/m2 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) of difference -14.6 to -3.9; p = 0.0011); left ventricular end diastolic volume index 8.4 ml/m2 v 19.0 ml/m2 (95% CI of difference, -17.0 to -4.2; p = 0.0016).

This effect is not lost after one month of treatment withdrawal and is thus due to an alteration of left ventricular structure and not to a short lived haemodynamic action of captopril. Long-term treatment with captopril does not result in improved aerobic exercise capacity after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "484": "Exposure of the tracheal mucosa of rats to capsaicin evokes neurogenic inflammation, one manifestation of which is the adherence of neutrophils to the endothelium of venules. In the present experiments, with the use of aerosolized capsaicin, we determined whether this neutrophil adhesion is inhibited by dexamethasone and whether the effect of dexamethasone can be reversed by inhibiting endopeptidase 24.11 (neutral endopeptidase, NEP) and kininase II (angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE), which degrade the neuropeptides that mediate neurogenic inflammation. Adult male pathogen-free F344 rats were treated for 2 days with dexamethasone or with vehicle (controls) and were then exposed for 2 min to aerosolized capsaicin. Neutrophils adhering to the endothelium of venules in tracheal whole mounts were stained histochemically for myeloperoxidase and then counted. Sites of increased vascular permeability were localized with Monastral blue. In the control rats, aerosolized capsaicin (10(-8)-10(-3) M) increased in a concentration-dependent fashion the number of adherent neutrophils and the amount of Monastral blue labeling of blood vessels. Dexamethasone in doses of 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg.kg-1.day-1 reduced by 49 63, 80, and 93%, respectively, the number of adherent neutrophils in capsaicin-exposed rats and caused similar reductions in the amount of Monastral blue labeling. When given alone, neither phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of NEP, nor captopril, an inhibitor of ACE, completely reversed this effect of dexamethasone, but when the two drugs were administered together, adherent neutrophils were as numerous in the dexamethasone-pretreated rats (112 +/- 9 neutrophils/mm2) as in controls (109 +/- 10 neutrophils/mm2). The amount of Monastral blue labeling was also similar in these two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the only currently available agents that can achieve this objective. In general, the major therapeutic effects of these agents in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension or of heart failure are exerted on the vascular tissue through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and, secondarily, of the sympathetic nervous system. When cardiovascular functional reserve is diminished and autoregulation of regional and systemic blood flow is strained, however, ACE inhibitors may affect other organ functions (heart, kidneys, and possibly brain), hormones other than the renin system, and local tissue humoral systems. The interrelations between the renin-angiotensin system and several other vasoactive systems--including circulating and locally generated tissue hormones and centrally acting neurohormonal factors--are complex and unclear. A better understanding of these mechanisms and interrelations would allow for a more rational therapeutic use of these agents. Unknown also are the clinical effects of prolonged ACE inhibition.

    "487": "These studies were designed to determine the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the renal hemodynamic response to acute protein feeding. In chronically instrumented conscious dogs on a normal (80 meq/day) sodium intake, a 10 g/kg meal of raw beef caused glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to increase from 68 +/- 6 to 86 +/- 6 ml/min and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) to increase from 211 +/- 14 to 263 +/- 15 ml/min. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was 0.44 +/- 0.14 ng ANG I.ml-1 x h-1 and did not change significantly. When the protocol was repeated during infusion of captopril, GFR increased from 67 +/- 11 to 97 +/- 10 ml/min, and ERPF rose from 264 +/- 74 to 392 +/- 82 ml/min after the meat meal. The dogs were then placed on a low-salt diet (approximately 7 meq/day) to physiologically activate the RAS. In sodium-restricted dogs, GFR increased from 71 +/- 7 to 104 +/- 10 ml/min and ERPF increased from 226 +/- 15 to 299 +/- 21 ml/min after the meat meal. PRA was 3.1 +/- 1.0 ng ANG I.ml-1 x h-1 and did not change. Thus neither blockade of the RAS with captopril nor activation of the RAS by salt restriction reduced the renal hemodynamic response to a meat meal. These data indicate that the RAS is relatively unimportant in the renal hemodynamic response to acute protein feeding.", 
    "488": "This study was designed to determine the importance of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and prostaglandin (PG) systems in regulating uteroplacental blood flow (UBF). Our objectives were to determine: 1) whether angiotensin II (ANG II) acts as a vasodilator or purely as a vasoconstrictor in the uteroplacental circulation, and 2) whether this circulation is capable of autoregulation. In chronically instrumented pregnant dogs (41-54 days gestation), ANG II was infused intravenously at increasing doses (8, 16, and 24 ng.kg-1 x min-1). Arterial pressure rose from 108 +/- 6 to 146 +/- 4 mmHg and UBF did not change but uterine vascular resistance (UVR) progressively increased. When the experiment was repeated while servo-controlling uterine arterial pressure, UBF fell at all doses, reaching 62 +/- 7% of control at the highest dose, and UVR increased as before. Meclofenamate (6 mg/kg i.v.) did not alter the dose-response curves. In separate experiments, uterine perfusion pressure was reduced in steps to 55 mmHg. UBF was well autoregulated down to approximately 85 mmHg, and neither captopril (14 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) nor meclofenamate altered UBF autoregulation. Thus ANG II appears to act as a vasoconstrictor in the uteroplacental circulation and any preservation of UBF during ANG II appears to be due to the increased arterial pressure. Also, in the dog the uteroplacental circulation possesses a mild to moderate degree of autoregulatory capability, which does not appear to be dependent on the RAS or PGs.",

    "490": "Drug-induced sexual dysfunction is well known to occur with antihypertensive drugs in men. There are much less data on the effects of drugs on female sexual function. The physiology of the female sexual response has similarities to that of the male sexual response and there are therefore good reasons for suspecting that antihypertensive drugs are likely to adversely affect sexual function in women. Present evidence suggests that clonidine, methyldopa, guanethidine and reserpine are associated with adverse effects on sexual function. In healthy volunteers, labetalol appears to reduce vaginal lubrication, but there are no studies in patients receiving the drug therapeutically. Thiazide diuretics may be associated with the worsening of sexual problems, which interestingly appear to be ameliorated by weight reduction. Present evidence on the effects of vasodilators is limited but the evidence suggests that sexual function in women receiving calcium antagonists is not altered by changing to an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Although present evidence suggests that effects on female sexual function may not be very great, it should be recognised that there are very few data in this area. Further work is clearly necessary.",

Drug treatment started 3 days before shunt surgery. An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and the development of right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) eccentric hypertrophy in response to volume overload occurred within the first week after induction of the shunt. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and cardiac renin activity peaked shortly after induction of the shunt. During the chronic phase, LVEDP and PRA decreased somewhat but remained significantly elevated up to 7 weeks after shunt surgery. Cardiac renin activity returned toward normal within 4 weeks after surgery. Treatment with the ACEI enalapril caused only a modest decrease in LV internal diameter but did not affect increases in LV and RV weights in response to volume overload despite a major decrease in LVEDP after chronic treatment. In contrast, treatment with the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan, which had similar effects on cardiac and peripheral hemodynamics, prevented dilation of the LV after 7 days and attenuated the dilation of the LV after 28 days. Moreover, increases in LV and RV weights were significantly attenuated by losartan.",

    "502": "A postmarketing surveillance study in 2273 Canadian office practices provided the largest body of clinical experience to date with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. The principal emphasis in this uncontrolled study was safety, assessed in 10,289 patients. Patients with a diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg were considered for the study. Both previously untreated patients and those who were experiencing adverse effects from their current antihypertensive regimen were included. Lisinopril was begun at a dose of 10 mg/day. Subsequent dose adjustments, to a maximum of 40 mg/day, were made to achieve optimal blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg or > or = 10 mmHg below baseline for > or = 4 weeks at the same dose). Therapy was continued for a minimum of 4 weeks to a maximum of 12 weeks, with patients examined every 2 weeks. The frequencies of adverse effects and laboratory abnormalities were analyzed in all treated patients. All 10,289 patients enrolled were considered in the analysis of safety. One or more adverse effects were reported for 1593 (15.5%) patients, and 802 (7.8%) withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. The most frequent adverse effects were cough (4.0%), dizziness (2.3%), headache (2.1%), asthenia (1.7%), and nausea (1.0%). The physicians' global assessment rated overall tolerability as very good or good for 77.1% of the patients. Antihypertensive effect was evaluated in 5886 patients who met the criteria for efficacy analysis. The criterion response was attained in 5141 (87.3%) patients, with 68.6% responding to 10 mg/day of lisinopril, 26.3% to 20 mg/day, and 3.2% to 40 mg/day (the other 1.9% responded at nonstandard doses). Lisinopril was safe and well-tolerated. Except for cough, class effects of ACE inhibitors were rarely encountered. The results of the efficacy analysis confirm the established efficacy of lisinopril in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.",

We studied the effects of enalaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in an attempt to identify such a protective drug. Thirty-four mongrel dogs underwent 90 min of bilateral renal pedicle clamping. Group I was a control of 6 animals. Group II comprised 10 animals who received 12.5 g iv mannitol 15 min prior to clamping and 1 mg/kg iv furosemide immediately after clamp removal. Group III also comprised 10 animals who received enalaprilat 1 mg/kg iv enalaprilat each 15 min prior to clamp placement. Group IV consisted of 8 dogs, each of which received 12.5 g mannitol and 1 mg/kg iv enalaprilat 15 min prior to clamping and 1 mg/kg iv furosemide immediately upon removal of the clamps. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were drawn preoperatively and at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr postoperatively in each animal. The serum BUN levels in group III were significantly lower than those in group I at all times postoperatively (P < 0.05) and were not significantly different from those of group II at any time postoperatively. Similarly, the serum creatinine levels in group III were significantly lower than those of group I (P < 0.05) and were not significantly different from those in group II at any time postoperatively. Neither the serum BUN nor the serum creatinine levels in group IV were different from those of group I at any time postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Mean supine and standing blood pressures measured at the end of the dose interval were significantly reduced compared to placebo by both compounds at three and six weeks. However, a consistent, significant increase in blood pressure occurred between three and six weeks in both arms of the study despite good and unchanged compliance with a fixed dose of each medication. Both captopril and lisinopril were well tolerated. Drug-related cough was the principal adverse effect.",

Converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase activities were both measured every 3 h by a fluorimetric method in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients diagnosed as migraineurs with aura after lumbar puncture, which was performed 9 h after an acute oral dose of enalapril or placebo. 2. A reduced converting enzyme activity, as compared with placebo, was observed in patients who were given enalapril. On the other hand, neutral endopeptidase activity detected after enalapril did not differ from that measured after placebo. 3. The results seem to indicate that enalapril penetrates the blood-brain barrier in sufficient amounts to reduce converting enzyme activity. Moreover, neutral endopeptidase was not affected by enalapril. Therefore, those clinical effects of the drug which have been attributed to the involvement of central opioid mechanisms may depend on the inhibition of brain converting enzyme but not the inhibition of brain neutral endopeptidase.", 
    "511": "1. Small arteries were isolated from either rat mesentery or human subcutaneous fat, and mounted in a myograph for the measurement of isometric force. 2. Superoxide dismutase, either in the presence or absence of catalase, relaxed noradrenaline-induced tone. This effect was abolished by removal of the endothelium or incubation with an inhibitor of NO synthase, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Catalase alone had a negligible effect on noradrenaline-induced tone. 3. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and putative free-radical scavenger, did not relax pre-contracted isolated vessels. N-Acetylcysteine caused an endothelium-independent relaxation of rat vessels. Similar effects were observed in human vessels. 4. Acetylcholine induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated resistance arteries, which was inhibited by removal of the endothelium or N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, but unaffected by indomethacin. Preincubation with captopril, N-acetylcysteine or catalase alone did not alter the acetylcholine concentration-response relationship, but superoxide dismutase in combination with catalase enhanced responses to acetylcholine, causing a six-fold increase in potency. 5. Superoxide dismutase causes endothelium-dependent relaxation of resistance arteries and potentiates responses to acetylcholine. This action is probably due to the ability of the enzyme to scavenge superoxide anions which inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxation. 6. N-Acetylcysteine causes an endothelium-independent relaxation of resistance arteries which is probably unrelated to the putative ability of this compound to scavenge superoxide radicals and may reflect a direct action on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "512": "Release of a suprarenal aortic clamp results in angiotensin-dependent, arterial pressure-mediated renal vasoconstriction. The experiments reported here were designed to show whether this represents operation of autoregulation and whether the slow component of autoregulation is affected by angiotensin II (ANG II). They were performed using halothane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 1st experiment renal perfusion pressure (RPP) was reduced in steps from spontaneous level to 45 mmHg and then returned in steps to the spontaneous level. The autoregulatory plateau was left-shifted some 20-30 mmHg, with the lower limit of autoregulation reduced from approximately 85 mmHg on the downward leg to approximately 60 mmHg on the upward leg. This resetting was blocked by captopril. Two experiments examined low pressure autoregulation in more detail. After RPP was reduced, three pairs of steps between 65 and 75 mmHg were performed. Significant renal vasodilatation was observed after downward pressure steps in both experiments. Time constants (tau) of resistance adjustment were recovered from most steps by curve fitting. In both experiments tau down = 0.07 +/- 0.01 Hz was faster than tau up = 0.04 +/- 0.01 Hz. Blockade of ANG II by enalaprilat or by the AT1-receptor blocker losartan potassium significantly inhibited regulatory vasodilatation and vasoconstriction at low RPP. Also, tau down = 0.04 +/- 0.01 Hz collapsed to the value of tau up = 0.04 +/- 0.01 Hz. These results demonstrate a significant role for ANG II in renal autoregulation. They show that ANG II is necessary for autoregulation to reset to operate at reduced arterial pressure and to defend a lower blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "513": "Fifty patients with mild or moderate hypertension were assessed for the influence on peripheral hemodynamics of 10 months of treatment with lisinopril (25 patients) or metoprolol (25 patients). Two-dimensional Doppler flowmetry was used for the evaluation. Responding patients (blood pressure < 150/90 mm Hg) were monitored for another 4 weeks after treatment withdrawal to determine whether changes in forearm hemodynamics, if any, persisted. Twenty-two patients from either group (88%) were considered to be responders. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving lisinopril dropped by 6% and 15%, respectively (p < 0.001), in those receiving metoprolol the decrease was 5.9% and 14%, respectively (p < 0.001). Forearm hemodynamics was not significantly different before treatment and improved in patients receiving lisinopril, with increased compliance (p < 0.001) and lower vascular resistance (p < 0.001). No significant changes were observed with metoprolol. After withdrawal, blood pressure returned to baseline values in both groups. However, improvement in forearm hemodynamics persisted in the lisinopril group. Hemodynamics changes were statistically different on lisinopril versus metoprolol both after treatment and after withdrawal. Lisinopril, but not metoprolol, seems capable to induce regression of functional and/or structural changes of large arteries in patients with hypertension.",

Patients were classified into two groups based upon the magnitude of MR as derived from Doppler color flow imaging: Group I (n = 13) had severe MR and Group II (n = 7) had moderate MR. Acute therapy significantly reduced systemic vascular resistance index in both groups and provided effective afterload reduction. Although cardiac and stroke volume indices increased in both groups, an improved forward flow was significant only for Group I (cardiac index 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 l/min/m2, p < 0.02). The magnitude of MR, acutely reduced in all patients, was similarly significant only for Group I (56 +/- 10% to 31 +/- 12%, p < 0.01). The reduction of both pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean arterial pressure was significant for both groups. This study supports the use of IV enalaprilat, a parenteral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, as an effective and rapidly acting vasodilator in the management of selected patients with chronic heart failure and MR who require immediate hemodynamic improvement.",

In six dogs, a 30-MHz, 4.3F ultrasound imaging catheter was placed in the midsegment of the circumflex coronary artery to measure cross-sectional area (CSA), and a 0.018-in. Doppler wire was placed alongside to measure coronary flow velocity. At peak effect (1.6 mg/kg), Losartan increased mean coronary CSA from 7.9 +/- 0.5 to 9.5 +/- 0.8 mm2 and average peak velocity (APV) from 32 +/- 10 to 56 +/- 18 cm/sec, resulting in an increase in coronary blood flow from 74 +/- 19 to 151 +/- 36 mL/min. The maximal effect of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (5 mg) was an increase in CSA from 7.7 +/- 0.7 to 8.4 +/- 0.8 mm2 and an increase in APV from 36 +/- 10 to 53 +/- 20 cm/sec, with an increase in coronary blood flow from 82 +/- 25 to 122 +/- 41 mL/min. Relative to maximal hyperemia with adenosine (6 mg i.c.), the magnitude of flow increase from baseline was 0.37 with the AT1-receptor antagonist and 0.19 with the ACE inhibitor (p < 0.05). These effects were seen without changes in heart rate or systemic arterial pressure. In an additional five dogs, the ultrasound imaging catheter was introduced directly over a 0.014-in. Doppler wire, and the effects of indomethacin, propranolol, and N omega-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) on the vasodilator effect of Losartan (1.6 mg/kg) were examined. Indomethacin and propranolol had no effect on Losartan-induced vasodilation, suggesting that it was not mediated via prostaglandins or beta-adrenoceptors. However, Losartan-induced epicardial vasodilation was partially inhibited by L-NAME, suggesting an action partly dependent on endothelial release of nitric oxide.",

Twenty arterial lesions in the trandolapril group, 17 in the captopril group, and 18 in the control group were evaluated. There was no significant difference in neointimal thickness or percentage luminal area stenosis for the groups as a whole. However, in quantitative comparisons in which vessel injury score was used as a covariate, the fractional increase in mean neointimal thickness per unit of injury was significantly less for the trandolapril group (p = 0.019) but not for the captopril group when compared with control animals. In this model, neointimal proliferation from arterial injury was inhibited by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with trandolapril but only modestly. Such an effect may not be clinically significant.", 
    "523": "A recently developed modification of the technique of the split hydronephrotic rat kidney enables intravital assessment of vascular reactivity of cortical and juxtamedullary (JM) glomeruli and their vascular network. Effects of the adenosine-1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and the adenosine-2 receptor agonist N-ethylcarboxamide-adenosine (CHA) and the adenosine-2 receptor agonist N-ethylcarboxamide-adenosine (NECA) on these renovascular structures were examined before and after angiotensin II-converting enzyme (CE) inhibition by quinapril (0.9 mg kg-1 iv). CE inhibition was undertaken to test for an interdependence of adenosine and angiotensin II, as we have previously demonstrated for cortical glomeruli and CHA. In the first series of experiments (n = 7), CHA (in local dosages from 10(-8) to 10(-6) mole liter-1 produced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction of all preglomerular vessels and a decrease of cortical glomerular blood flow that was markedly attenuated by CE inhibition. In JM glomeruli, CHA also led to a dose-dependent vasoconstriction, but these effects were, on the contrary, unchanged or even increased by CE inhibition. In the second series (n = 6), NECA (in local dosages from 10(-8) to 10(-5) mole liter-1) led to a vasodilation and an increase in glomerular blood flow both before and after CE inhibition in both cortical and JM glomeruli. The reactions induced by NECA alone in the principal preglomerular vessel segments were significantly larger than those under NECA and simultaneous CE inhibition, thereby demonstrating an attenuation of NECA effects induced by CE inhibition. In additional series, we demonstrated a dose-dependent vasoconstriction of all pre- and postglomerular cortical vessel segments by local application of angiotensin I (dosage 10(-8) to 10(-6) mole liter-1) and the abolition of these effects by quinapril. Our findings demonstrate a differential reactivity of cortical and juxtamedullary glomeruli to adenosine receptor agonists and, additionally, an interdependence of adenosine-and angiotensin II-induced renovascular effects.",

The present study investigates the side effects of antihypertensive drugs in the Toulouse University Hospital (France) between 1981 and 1990. Most of the side effects involved ACEI (45%), CCB (22%) and diuretics (18%). Central antihypertensive agents and beta-blocking drugs were involved in 8 and 9% of side effects respectively. During these 10 years, 197 side effects were reported in our hospital (3300 beds). Some of them were found more frequently: renal insufficiency (15%) or cough (9%) with ACEI, constipation (3%), gingivitis (1%) or lower limb oedema (4.5%) with CCB, hemolytic or autoimmune anemia (2.5%) and confusional state (1.5%) with central antihypertensive agents, nightmares (1.5%) with propranolol. The most frequently side effects were dermatological (20%), hydroelectrolytic (10%) and neuropsychiatric (9.6%) disturbances. In spite of the methodological problems of this kind of study (retrospective evaluation, under-notification of the side effects and different scores of imputability), these data indicate the most frequently observed side effects of antihypertensive agents during the eighties. It allows to estimate an approximate frequency of these side effects: among the antihypertensive drugs, CCB and diuretics seems the less frequently involved in the occurrence of reported side effects.",

We addressed this problem on 22 mildly hypertensive subjects (48 +/- 2 years; arterial pressure 151 +/- 3/95 +/- 1 mmHg), in whom sympathetic vasomotor tone was non invasively inferred by the power of the low frequency component (0.1 Hz) of the spontaneous oscillations of systolic arterial pressure (LFSAP), during placebo and after 4 weeks of treatment with a new ACE inhibitor, cilazapril, 5 mg per os oid. LFSAP was computed at rest and during physical (active orthostatism) and mental (computerized attentional test and mental arithmetic) stimuli capable of enhancing sympathetic drive. Cilazapril treatment reduced resting arterial pressure to 128 +/- 3/80 +/- 2 mmHg, without affecting heart rate (78 +/- 2 and 74 +/- 2 b/min, respectively). The increases in LFSAP produced by standing were significantly greater during placebo than during active treatment (delta LFSAP = 10 +/- 3 and 5 +/- 2 mmHg2, respectively).

In SHR, such a treatment with captopril resulted in an arterial blood pressure similar to that of normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Upon electrical microstimulation of the RVL, the minimal threshold current required to elicit a pressor response in captopril-treated SHR was significantly higher than that observed in SHR. Furthermore, analysis of the discharge pattern of RVL spinal projecting cardiovascular neurons showed a significant difference between captopril-treated and untreated SHR with respect to the proportion of double discharge units and the regularity of single discharge units. These properties of the RVL in captopril-treated SHR were, however, similar to those of WKY. Upon withdrawal of electrical microstimulation, the secondary sustained pressor response characteristic of SHR, but not of WKY, persisted in captopril-treated SHR at a smaller magnitude and a shorter duration. These results indicate that the normalization of arterial blood pressure in SHR upon chronic oral treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is associated with changes in properties of RVL cardiovascular neurons towards those of WKY. This suggests that brain angiotensin and RVL cardiovascular neurons play interactive roles in the development of hypertension in SHR.",

In 16 patients with EH and in 20 healthy subjects a thermal dehydration test was performed. In patients with EH this test was done twice: before treatment and after 6 weeks of captopril therapy. In all subjects plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (Ald) AVP and ANP were measured before and after thermal dehydration. In sweat samples collected after 15' and 45' of thermal dehydration the concentration of Na, K and Cl was assessed. In hypertensive patients before captopril treatment significantly higher values of PRA, ALD and ANP were found, while sweat concentrations of Na and Cl were significantly lower than in controls. After captopril treatment sweat electrolytes concentrations showed a tendency to normalize. No significant correlation was found between the plasma hormonal profile and sweat Na, K and Cl concentrations respectively both in controls and patients with EH pretreatment. A significant positive correlation was noticed only in hypertensive patients post-treatment between plasma aldosterone and sweat Na and Cl concentration respectively. Results obtained in this study show, that volume related hormones (Ald, AVP, ANP) do not seem to influence markedly the electrolyte composition of thermal sweat both in healthy subjects and in hypertensive patients.",

The results indicated that intravenous captopril may rapidly reduce cardiac preload and afterload, increase cardiac output, inhibit renin system activity and decrease plasma level of catecholamine. A short period of treatment with intravenous captopril may produce a rapid symptomatic improvement in patients with acute or severe heart failure. There was a good tolerance with the therapy.", 
    "539": "Captopril (0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the myocardial infarct size and prevented the progressive decrease in voltage of the R wave in rats. It had no marked effect on systolic blood pressure at these dose levels but higher doses (1 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced systolic blood pressure. It also produced a concentration-dependent (50-700 ng/10(6) cells) decrease of chemiluminescence response from rat neutrophils and markedly reduced serum malonyldialdehyde levels, elevated as a consequence of left coronary artery ligation. It is suggested that the protective effect of captopril may be mediated through a decreased formation or scavenging of reactive oxygen species.", 
    "540": "Kinetensin is a nonapeptide, originally isolated from pepsin-treated plasma, that shares some sequence homology with the C-terminal end of neurotensin. The present study was designed to determine, by infusing kinetensin to conscious sheep, the pharmacokinetics and a neurotensin-like biological activity (pancreatic polypeptide response) of kinetensin. Kinetensin was rapidly metabolized, approximately 200-fold more rapidly than neurotensin. The majority of the metabolism occurred in the circulation as demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. The lung and gut cleared kinetensin also. Inhibition of converting enzyme, present in highest concentration in the lung, abolished lung clearance but was without effect on kinetensin metabolism by the gut or in the general circulation. Arterial infusion of kinetensin which achieved high blood kinetensin levels at the pancreas did not increase plasma pancreatic polypeptide. We conclude that the extremely rapid degradation of exogenous kinetensin, together with the lack of biological activity, makes it unlikely that kinetensin plays a role as a circulating regulatory peptide. Nevertheless, since the putative kinetensin substrate circulates at microM concentrations, it is feasible that kinetensin is generated and metabolized at the target organ.", 
    "541": "The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study which will be conducted in some 20 countries world-wide. Two major issues will be investigated: i) What is the optimal target diastolic blood pressure during antihypertensive treatment with regard to the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality? In order to address this question patients will be randomized to three different therapeutic goals: a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg, < or = 85 mmHg or < or = 80 mmHg; ii) The second aim is to evaluate the effect of a low dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) 75 mg o.d. in comparison with placebo on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The first aim will be investigated in accordance with the PROBE design (Prospective Randomized Open Blinded Endpoint evaluation), whereas the evaluation of aspirin versus placebo will be conducted under double blind conditions. It is estimated that 1,100 clinical events will be needed in order to answer the question regarding the relationship between target diastolic blood pressure and major cardiovascular events. The collection of these events will require the enrollment of at least 18,000 hypertensive men and women aged 50-80 years to be followed for 2.5 years (about 40,000 patient years). All patients will be given felodipine 5 mg o.d. as basic antihypertensive treatment with the addition of a beta-blocker or an ACE-inhibitor in a second step, with further predetermined increments in dosage as required in order to obtain the randomized therapeutic goal.", 
    "542": "This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of monotherapy with felodipine and enalapril in patients with essential hypertension using a double-blind randomised crossover design. Thirty-five subjects (22 male, 13 female--ages: median 48 years, range 31-69 years) entered the randomised phases of the study and 32 subjects completed the study. Following a 4-week run-in placebo phase, the treatments were felodipine (\"Plendil ER\") 5-20 mg and enalapril 5-20 mg orally once daily for 8 weeks, each with matching placebos. Dose titration was at 2 and/or 4 weeks in each phase. Number of subjects with each different end-of-phase dose were for felodipine: 5 mg--8, 10 mg--11, 20 mg--13 and enalapril: 5 mg--6, 10 mg--9, 20 mg--17. Predose supine blood pressure (mean +/- SEM) was reduced in both active treatment phases compared with the run-in phase (159 + 2/101 +/- 1), but there was no significant difference in blood pressure between the active phases: felodipine 143 +/- 2/90 +/- 1 and enalapril 146 +/- 2/92 +/- 1. The most common adverse effects were for felodipine: headache, flushing, ankle swelling; and for enalapril: cough. Felodipine and enalapril as once daily monotherapy are thus of similar antihypertensive efficacy but with predictably different adverse effect profiles.", 
    "543": "The cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby hypertension causes vascular and cardiac disease are beginning to be understood. Angiotensin II, perhaps because so many probes to explore its action are available, is emerging as a central pathogenetic factor in the development of both vascular and cardiac hypertrophy. It is clear that this peptide has direct growth effects on vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiocytes as well as indirect effects by stimulating the synthesis of growth factors or potentiating their effects. However, the details of its action need clarification. Abnormalities in endothelium-derived relaxing factor regulation are a new pathogenetic mechanism of hypertension and are also likely to be intimately involved in the development of hypertensive cardiovascular disease. In the clinical arena, converting enzyme inhibitors are emerging as the best antihypertensive agents, and new therapeutic trials and further support to the suspicion that, when in doubt, it is better to treat.", 
    "544": "In 13 normotensive subjects on a normal sodium diet, we studied hormonal, blood pressure, and renal vascular changes and dextran sieving profiles induced by infusion of exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) (5 ng.kg-1.min-1). during baseline conditions and after 5 days of administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril. Cilazapril induced a renal vasodilative effect without affecting supine blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate. Fractional dextran clearances were significantly decreased for dextran of effective radius ranging from 3.0 to 4.0 nm. This shift was primarily related to an increase in glomerular capillary plasma flow, because no change was observed in the transcapillary glomerular pressure gradient, the ultrafiltration coefficient, or the membrane parameters. Ang II elicited a slight pressor response accompanied by hormonal, antinatriuretic, and renal hemodynamic changes that were similar during and before short-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Dextran sieving curves were unchanged by a low dose of Ang II. However, the transcapillary glomerular pressure gradient and the ultrafiltration coefficient were computed to increase by 19.4% and to decrease by 44.2%, respectively, whereas membrane parameters were unaffected. When superimposed onto short-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, glomerular response to this unique dose of Ang II was similar to that induced by Ang II alone. These findings indirectly suggest that most, if not all, of the renal effects of cilazapril are mediated through suppression of Ang II formation.", 
    "545": "The mechanism of natriuresis with calcium entry blockers such as felodipine is largely unexplained. As these drugs prevent sodium retention following exogenous angiotensin II, the natriuretic effect of felodipine might be due to a similar interaction with endogenous angiotensin II. In such a case, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with ramipril should prevent natriuresis with felodipine. We tested this hypothesis in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 12 male volunteers by comparing intravenous felodipine after 1 week of oral ramipril with felodipine after placebo and with solvent after ramipril. Ramipril pretreatment reduced ACE activity to 11 +/- 1%, lowered the blood pressure, and increased renal blood flow. However, ramipril pretreatment did not prevent the pronounced increase in natriuresis and diuresis with felodipine. Fractional sodium excretion only tended to increase less during felodipine after ramipril than during felodipine after placebo (absolute changes of + 1.2 +/- 0.2 and + 1.7 +/- 0.2%, respectively; p = 0.07). Ramipril did not influence the felodipine-mediated blood pressure reduction and renal vasodilation. In conclusion, ACE inhibition has no significant effect on the natriuretic and hemodynamic effects of felodipine, suggesting that mechanisms other than interaction with endogenous angiotensin II are involved in these effects of calcium entry blockers.", 
    "546": "We wished to assess the hemodynamic effects of administration of the combination of the calcium channel blocking agent amlodipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazeprilat in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In SHR previously instrumented for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), intravenous (i.v.) injection of amlodipine (0.25-4 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure (BP). Administration of benazeprilat (0.1-10 mg/kg i.v.) decreased arterial MAP, and benazeprilat (10 mg/kg) effectively blocked the effects of exogenously administered angiotensin I (AI). In animals surgically prepared for measurement of BP, HR, and hindquarter, renal, and mesenteric blood flows, administration (i.v.) of the combination of amlodipine (0.5 mg/kg) with benazeprilat (10 mg/kg) evoked a decrease in BP that was greater than that elicited by monotherapy. The tachycardic response observed after administration of the combination was no different from that observed after monotherapy with amlodipine. Simultaneous administration of amlodipine and benazeprilat produced reductions in vascular resistance in the hindquarter, renal and mesenteric beds that were greater than the responses evoked by injection of either agent. The major finding of these studies was that dual therapy with amlodipine and benazeprilat produced an additive hypotensive effect in conscious SHR. Regional vasodilation accompanied the large degree of hypotension evoked by the combination.", 
    "547": "To test whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may prevent myocardial damage and may affect coronary microvasculature in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), young 5-week-old SHR were treated for 3 months with spirapril and changes in blood pressure (BP) were monitored. Untreated SHR were used as controls. The rats were killed; left ventricular (LV) shape, weight, and wall thickness were examined and the ventricular myocardium was analyzed morphometrically to determine the effect of the drug on the relative amount, number per unit area of myocardium, and average dimension of foci of myocardial scarring. Moreover, volume fraction, surface, numerical density, and diffusion distance for oxygen of the coronary capillaries were analyzed. BP remained 20-30% lower in treated SHR with respect to controls, and LV weight and thickness decreased 20 and 21%, respectively. The number and dimension of the foci of fibrosis were reduced, resulting in an overall 68% decrement in the amount of myocardial damage. Finally, a 28% increment in numerical density of capillary profiles associated with a 13% reduction in their cross-sectional area decreased the diffusion distance for oxygen from the capillary wall to the myocytes by 14% in treated SHR. Spirapril decreases BP and LV weight and thickness in the SHR model of hypertension and substantially improves coronary capillary microvasculature, decreasing hypertensive myocardial damage. These results may be attributed to inhibition of the systemic effects of angiotensin II (AII) as well as to a local protective action of the drug against possible intramyocardial AII production.", 
    "548": "Angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and renin constitute the components of the renin-angiotensin system. The mammalian renal proximal tubule contains angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin receptors. Previous immunohistochemical studies describing the presence of renin in the proximal tubule could not distinguish synthesized renin from renin trapped from the glomerular filtrate. In the present study, we examined the presence of renin activity and mRNA in rabbit proximal tubule cells in primary culture and renin mRNA in microdissected proximal tubules. Renin activity was present in lysates of proximal tubule cells in primary culture. Cellular renin content in cultured proximal tubule cells was increased by incubation with 10(-5) M isoproterenol and 10(-5) M forskolin by 150 and 110%, respectively. In addition, renin transcripts were detected in poly(A)+ RNA from cultured proximal tubule cells by RNA blots under high stringency conditions. In microdissected tubules from normal rats, renin mRNA was not detectable with reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. However, in tubules from rats administered the angiotensinogen-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, renin was easily detected in the S2 segment of the proximal tubule. We postulate the existence of a local renin-angiotensin system that enables the proximal tubule to generate angiotensin II, thereby providing an autocrine system that could locally modulate NaHCO3 and NaCl absorption.", 
    "549": "We studied 14 patients who had exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias after a previous Q-wave myocardial infarction. All had symptomatic mild heart failure in New York Heart Association class II and a maximal oxygen consumption between 16 and 20 ml/kg/min. They were treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril (20 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) for 3 months in a double-blind randomized cross-over study. Benazepril improved the maximal oxygen uptake by 15% and exercise time by 18%. Hydrochlorothiazide slightly increased exercise time (5%) and the respiratory exchange ratio but not oxygen consumption. The arrhythmias were nonsustained and reproducible in two baseline recordings. Compared with baseline, benazepril reduced the mean number (3.5 +/- 2.5) (+/- SD) of episodes of ventricular tachycardia by 66%, and total (47.4 +/- 40.9) and paired (5.2 +/- 4.5) premature ventricular contractions by 61% and 62%, respectively. Hydrochlorothiazide did not reduce the number of arrhythmias. Thus an improved cardiac function induced by benazepril is associated with a reduction in exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in patients with symptomatic mild heart failure after infarction.", 
    "550": "The natural history of patients with heart failure has changed relatively little until recently. Several large randomized trials have however recently changed our approach to the patient with symptomatic as well as asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Although the effect of digoxin on survival is still uncertain there is still good evidence from the Radiance study in which patients were randomly withdrawn from digoxin that patients who remain on digoxin have a significant improvement in exercise tolerance and well being. The Consensus trial in patients with class IV heart failure suggested that ACE inhibitors were effective in improving survival. This therapy has not however been widely adapted in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. The recent randomized SOLVD treatment trial in conjunction with the VHEFT II study clearly shows that ACE inhibitors should be the basis for therapy along with a diuretic and digoxin if necessary in all patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction unless contraindicated or not tolerated. There is also evidence from the SOLVD prevention trial that ACE inhibitors can prevent the development of manifest heart failure and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. The importance of ACE inhibitors in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is confirmed by data from the SAVE trial which examine both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction 3-16 days post infarction. Of interest in both the SOLVD treatment and prevention trials as well as the SAVE trial was the finding that ACE inhibitors reduced the incidence of recurrent ischemic events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Whereas myocardial dysfunction assumes a central pathophysiologic role in the development of chronic heart failure, alterations in the peripheral vasculature and neurohormonal systems serve to modulate the heart failure state. Short-term studies of nonspecific vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors demonstrate a beneficial effect of these agents on left ventricular function, hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function. More recently, several large-scale multicenter trials have documented improved survival in patients with heart failure who received vasodilating agents. These studies, in conjunction with hemodynamic and functional studies, argue strongly for the widespread use of vasodilator therapy, notably the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, for congestive heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",

The wealth of data permit the conclusion that many of the drugs in these substance groups are neutral in terms of metabolism. There are, however, also individual substances that lead to an elevation of lipid levels. Via an improvement in glucose tolerance, ACE-inhibitors can contribute to a lowering of triglyceride concentrations and an increase in the HDL cholesterol levels. For a number of substance groups, the data available still do not suffice to permit a definitive conclusion to be drawn.",

They all had an at least 75% stenosis of a main coronary artery branch, proven by coronary angiography no longer than 6 months previously. Each patient underwent six ergometric tests (two each per day on alternate days) at constant exercise level and duration: the sum of S-T segment depressions was measured during the recovery and exercise minutes. The initial ergometry test was done without medication, when the S-T segment sum was 1.15 +/- 0.20 mV. After 25 mg captopril (2nd ergometry period) this sum fell to 0.80 +/- 0.18 mV. Two hours after application of a nitrate plaster the S-T segment sum was 0.55 +/- 0.12 mV (3rd ergometry period). Adding 25 mg captopril a further reduction to 0.35 +/- 0.10 was achieved (4th ergometry period). Subsequently, continuous nitrate application brought about nitrate tolerance. The 5th ergometry period then produced a sum of S-T segment depressions of 0.85 +/- 0.18 mV. Renewed captopril administration reduced this value to 0.50 +/- 0.13 mV (57% of the initial value). The effect of captopril in nitrate tolerance is apparently due to an addition of the anti-ischaemic action of the ACE inhibitor (31%) and the residual effect of the nitrate (26%).",

Rates of ribosome formation and protein synthesis cannot be further accelerated during in vitro perfusion with agents that increase cyclic AMP, that bind to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors or that bind to angiotensin II receptors. Growth of the heart in vivo can be restrained by treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate, or an angiotensin receptor antagonist, DuP 753. In the enalapril-treated heart, norepinephrine plus propranolol, but not angiotensin II, accelerated ribosome formation. Rapid growth of the left ventricle of pig heart during the first 10 days of life is due largely to eccentric hypertrophy.", 
    "557": "The susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias under the conditions of cardiac ischemia and reperfusion was investigated in the Langendorff heart preparation of rats fed for eight weeks a standard chow enriched with 2% of pulverized wild garlic leaves. The isolated hearts were perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during 20 min occlusion of the descending branch of the left coronary artery (LAD) was significantly reduced in the wild garlic group as compared to untreated controls (20% vs 88%). The same holds for the size of the ischemic zone (33.6% vs 40.9% of heart weight). In the reperfusion experiments (5 min after 10 min ischemia), ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred in 70% of the wild garlic group vs 100% in untreated controls and VF in 50% vs 90%. The time until occurrence of extrasystoles, VT or VR was prolonged. No significant alterations in cardiac fatty acid composition could be observed. Although the prostacyclin production was slightly increased in hearts of the wild garlic group, inhibition of cyclooxygenase by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) could not completely prevent the cardioprotective effects suggesting that the prostaglandin system does not play a decisive role in the cardioprotective action of wild garlic. Furthermore, a moderate angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting action of wild garlic was found in vitro as well as in vivo that could contribute to the cardioprotective and blood pressure lowering action of wild garlic. Whether a free radical scavenging activity of wild garlic is involved in its cardioprotective effects remains to be established.", 
    "558": "Cardiac hypertrophy in rats was produced by aortic banding for 6 weeks and regression of hypertrophy in these experimental animals was induced by administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. The left ventricular muscle mass and systolic pressure were decrease upon treating the hypertrophied rats with enalapril. This drug also decreased the number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in hypertrophied myocardium without any changes in beta-adrenoceptors. The regression of cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats by enalapril for 10 weeks was not associated with any alterations in alpha 1-adrenoceptors in hypertrophied myocardium, but was decreased in beta-adrenoceptors. Effects of enalapril on extracellular matrix in the myocardium was also observed in regression of hypertrophy in which the type III collagen mRNA expression and collagen contents were reduced in comparison with those of hypertrophied myocardium. These results indicate that regression of cardiac hypertrophy is not always associated with a decrease in the number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and that the beneficial effects of enalapril in the hypertrophied heart in aortic banding animals may be of some specific nature.",

Previously developed EIAs for bradykinin (BK) and for des-Phe8-Arg9-BK ([1-7]BK) were also used. Incubation of rat plasma with glass powder resulted in the transient appearance of BK. A degradation product, [1-7]BK, could be detected in the incubation mixture for a longer period of time. When compared with BK and [1-7]BK, a larger amount of [1-5]BK was detectable even longer. In carrageenan-induced pleurisy in rats, which was associated with a peak rate of plasma exudation 5 hr after administration of carrageenan, BK was undetectable (< 160 pg/rat) in the pleural exudates. By contrast, [1-7]BK was detectable over the entire course of the inflammatory response. A larger amount of [1-5]BK was detectable. The peak level of [1-5]BK was 6050 +/- 1050 pg/rat, 5 hr after administration of carrageenan.

The number of revertant colonies in the bacterial strains did not exceed twice that obtained in the solvent control either in the presence or absence of S9 mix.

Schultz-Dale reaction with isolated ileum of sensitized guinea pigs; 5. passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in rats with serum of sensitized mice; and 6. delayed type skin reaction by Maximization test in guinea pigs. In the test of immediate type reactions, guinea pigs were sensitized by RU44570 (p.o.), an FCA emulsion of RU44570 (s.c.) or an FCA emulsion of incubate solution of RU44570 and normal guinea pig's serum, and mice were sensitized by a mixture of RU44570 and alum (i.p.). In the test of delayed type reaction, guinea pigs were sensitized by intradermal injection and patch application. 1. ASA in guinea pigs: No anaphylaxis symptoms were observed in any of the sensitized guinea pigs. 2. PCA in guinea pigs: PCA titer of sera from all the sensitized animals was less than 1. 3. Histamine release from lung tissue: No histamine release was observed in any of the isolated lung tissue. 4. Schultz-Dale reaction: No contraction was observed in any of the isolated ileums. 5. PCA in rats: PCA titer of sera from sensitized BALB/c and C3H/He mice was less than 5. 6. Delayed type skin reaction test: No skin reactions were observed in any of the sensitized guinea pigs.

In each group, 24 or 25 pregnant female rats were allowed to litter naturally for the postnatal examination of their offspring. Clinical symptoms and mortality attributable to the administration of RU44570 were not observed in the dams (P). In the 30 and 300 mg/kg group, food consumption was slightly lower than that of the control group during the lactation period, however RU44570 did not affect body weight gain. Incidence of dilatation of renal pelvis with higher value in kidney weight was increased in offspring (F1) in the 30 and 300 mg/kg dosage groups, and water consumption at the same dosage groups was higher than that of the control group. Body weight gain in offspring (F1) was depressed in each treated group and viability of offspring (F1) from postpartum day 0 to day 4 was slightly decreased in the 30 and 300 mg/kg dosage groups comparing with that of the control group. No adverse effects were observed on the other postnatal development of the offspring, such as differentiation, sexual maturation, reflex, motor activity, emotionality, learning ability and reproductive performance. No adverse effects were detected in the second generation offspring (F2).

After the administration period, 25 and 250 mg/kg groups were observed for recovery for 4 weeks. The results obtained are as follows: 1. One male in the 250 mg/kg group showed decrease of food consumption and body weight, stomatitis, hematemesis, decumbence, hypothermia, and finally loss of reactivity to stimuli. This animal was killed because of these severe changes on the 39th day of administration. Among the surviving animals, a temporary loss of body weight was observed in a few animals of the 25 and 250 mg/kg groups, and a decreased food consumption was sporadically seen in a few animals of the 250 mg/kg group during the administration period. No abnormal changes were found in the clinical observation and water intake in the surviving animals. 2. The changes attributable to the pharmacological effect of RU44570 were a decreased activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, increases in plasma renin activity and urine volume, and decreases in specific gravity and concentrations of Na, K and Cl in the urine of every administration group. A decrease in blood pressure and an increase in the PAS and Bowie positive granules in the juxtaglomerular cells were also found in the 25 and 250 mg/kg groups. In addition, thickening of the afferent arteriolar wall of the glomeruli, a basophilic change of the renal tubular epithelial cells, and localized atrophy and hypertrophy of the renal tubules were observed in the 25 and 250 mg/kg groups, and increases in BUN, ALP and creatinine, and a slight dilation of the renal tubules were seen in the 250 mg/kg group. These observations indicated that RU44570 affected renal structure at a dose of 25 mg/kg or more renal function at a dose of 250 mg/kg. The animal killed in a moribund state showed nephrosis which consisted mainly of a moderate dilation of the renal tubules and vacuolation of the renal tubular epithelial cells, stomatitis, severe hemorrhage and necrosis with neutrophil infiltration in the fundus of the glandular stomach, atrophy of the hemopoietic system, and ectopic calcification in the heart, kidneys, stomach, trachea and alveolar wall. Changes in the kidneys similar to those observed in other animals were also detected.

    "576": "The aim of the study was to determine the efficiency of enalapril therapy during 24-hours blood pressure monitoring. A group of healthy subjects (C, n = 11), a group of patients with essential hypertension without therapy (EH, n = 9) and a group of patients with essential hypertension II (WHO) treated with enalapril (Acepril Lachema) in once a day doses (13.0 +/- 2.1 mg per kg) during at least 10 months (EH A, n = 8). In all groups of patients and healthy subjects 24-hours blood pressure measurement was provided using Accutracker II equipment. The mean values of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 24-hours measurement (+/- SD) were in the group of healthy subjects C 121.38 +/- 10.49/74.79 +/- 7.88 mmHg, in the group EH 146.58 +/- 12.20/88.0 +/- 8.97 mmHg, in the group EH A 127.38 +/- 8.36/74.71 +/- 6.08 mmHg. The differences between the maximum and minimum mean blood pressure values during 24 hours (SBP/DBP) were in the group C 33/27 mmHg, EH 37/29 mmHg, EH A 29/21 mmHg. The smaller difference in SBP and DBP in EH A patients was significant in comparison to C and EH (t-test, p < 0.05). Cosinor analysis proved the results. From our results we can conclude that the Acepril therapy decreases blood pressure more during the day-hours then during night and it is preferable in connection to the risk of night hypotension with hypoxia.", 
    "577": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is well established as a treatment modality for hypertension and congestive heart failure. While converting enzyme inhibitors are well tolerated, they still have some side effects, which rightly or wrongly are attributed to the lack of specificity of the target enzyme for the renin-angiotensin cascade. The attempt is therefore made to inhibit the more specific enzyme renin or to block the angiotensin II receptor. While so far renin inhibitors are generally hampered by insufficient oral bioavailability, potent orally active angiotensin II antagonists are currently in clinical development. Both pharmacologic principles, renin inhibition and angiotensin II antagonism, have been shown to actively reduce blood pressure of hypertensive patients. It remains to be seen whether these newer compounds will be able to replace the converting enzyme inhibitors and exhibit even fewer untoward effects.", 
    "578": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been accepted as drugs of first choice in the treatment of hypertension beside beta-blockers, diuretics and calcium antagonists. ACE inhibitors are effective, well tolerated and produce a small rate of adverse effects. They may be used in mild, moderate and severe hypertension of essential or renal origin regardless of age and sex. Since long term studies are missing, knowledge is lacking whether ACE inhibitors have the same beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as diuretics and beta-blockers. ACE inhibitors represent one of the best established and documented therapies of chronic congestive heart failure. When ACE inhibitors are added to the conventional treatment of congestive heart failure, the mortality will be reduced in all states of congestive heart failure.", 
    "579": "Cardiovascular diseases are often associated with increased activity of the systemic and/or local renin-angiotensin systems. Hence, with respect to the coronary vessels, it has been demonstrated that in patients with severe heart failure inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor clearly reduces resistance in the systemic, renal and cardiovascular systems. This reduction in resistance improves the blood supply to the failing heart while, at the same time, diminishing the external workload. It is most likely this effect that contributes towards the improved progression of the underlying disease observed after ACE inhibitor administration. The clinical efficacy of ACE inhibitors in patients who had been subjected to repeated coronary angioplasty has, however, been disappointing. Although these agents exerted a clear inhibitory effect on neo-intima proliferation after balloon dilatation performed on animals, it was not observed in patients with coronary artery disease and did not prevent restenosis. In patients suffering from heart failure there is an increase in sympathetic tone and a decrease in parasympathetic tone. An increase in activity of the renin-angiotensin system produces an increase in sympathetic activity at the level of the peripheral sympathetic synapses and vagus blockage via its effect on the vagal centres in the postremal area. Both effects can be clearly diminished by administering ACE inhibitors. Although high sympathetic tone and low parasympathetic activity are indicators of low life expectancy in heart failure, a clear correlation between the incidence of sudden cardiac death and the changes in autonomic nervous system activity has not yet been established.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "580": "Drug induced modification of the renin-angiotensin system is of established benefit in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. The responses to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (CAS 75847-73-3) have been studied in essential hypertension and normotensive controls. The kinetics and dynamics of enalapril have been characterised in an integrated concentration-effect model to identify factors underlying responsiveness to the ACE inhibitor. In addition models to predict the response to long-term treatment from changes after the first dose have been developed. Enalapril response could be described by a non linear (Emax) model defined by two parameters - the maximum response (Emax) and the drug concentration required to cause 50% of the maximum response (C50). Acute dosing accurately predicted the Emax after 6 weeks treatment. In addition to individual pharmacokinetics, pretreatment blood pressure was the most important determinant of response to enalapril. In caucasian salt-replete essential hypertension neither age nor plasma renin activity were major factors. However, in states of sodium restriction and/or diuretic treatment, the response to enalapril was greatly increased. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan has been reported to be without effect on blood pressure in salt-replete normals. Salt restriction together with furosemide for 3 days led to dose-related falls in blood pressure in normal subjects after losartan 25-100 mg. Concentration-effect analysis can be used to describe blood pressure responses, to predict the responses to long-term treatment and also to identify quantitatively important factors determining the response in individual patients.", 
    "581": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. However, ACE not only cleaves angiotensin I but is also responsible for the degradation of bradykinin. Therefore, renin inhibitors which block the system at an early step without influence on bradykinin should be devoid of side effects. Since renin has a very strong species specificity, it was necessary to develop new techniques to measure arterial pressure as well as hypertension models in primates in order to select orally active renin inhibitors. Remikiren (Ro 42-5892, CAS 126371-83-3) is a very potent renin inhibitor in vitro (IC50 for human renin = 0.7 nmol/l) and in vivo. Despite short lasting biochemical changes the arterial blood pressure decrease induced by remikiren is very long lasting (over 24 h). Several in vivo experiments have shown that remikiren is specific for renin and does not decrease arterial pressure by an unrelated mechanism. In sodium depleted monkeys, the blood pressure decrease induced by remikiren was similar to the blood pressure decrease induced by cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor. Clinical results seem to confirm the preclinical findings and show that remikiren is indeed a potent orally active renin inhibitor inducing a long lasting blood pressure decrease.", 
    "582": "The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Components of this system, renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) angiotensinogen, angiotensin II and angiotensin II receptors have been found in many tissues including kidney, adrenal, blood vessels and in discrete brain regions. This suggests that in addition to circulating angiotensin II, endogenous tissue renin-angiotensin system may also be important in cardiovascular control and maintaining fluid balance. Inhibitors for ACE are used successfully in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure. In experimental animals, these inhibitors are found to block ACE in the kidney, lung, adrenal, blood vessels and the forebrain circumventricular organs after oral administration. The time course of tissue ACE inhibition correlated closely with the blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs. Most ACE inhibitors are unable to penetrate the blood-brain and blood-testis barriers. However, the more lipophilic drugs do penetrate the blood brain barrier, especially after chronic administration. The potential use of inhibitors for renin and angiotensin II receptors for the treatment of hypertension are being explored. An inhibitor for the AT1 angiotensin receptor, losartan (CAS 124750-99-8), which has potent antihypertensive effect, demonstrated dose and time dependent inhibition of AT1 receptors in the kidney and adrenal. Losartan also crossed the blood-brain barrier after acute peripheral administration suggesting additional possible central sites of action.", 
    "583": "The challenge in hypertension research is the elucidation of the primary, genetic causes of elevated blood pressure. The basic information on how a cell, an organ, and the whole body function resides within the chromosomes, the individual genes and their DNA sequence. The problem with understanding primary (genetic) hypertension in man is that several genes are involved in the cardiovascular control mechanisms and that the genetics are complex. In addition, environmental factors which act over long time-spans confound the genotype/phenotype relationship individually, within a family, and regionally. This shows that while monogenetic, dominant traits and diseases such as some lipid disorders may be studied with relative ease, polygenetic diseases like primary hypertension remain puzzles, which make well defined experimental models as well as new strategies in the genetics of human primary hypertension mandatory. The availability of new molecular biological techniques enables us to conduct genetic linkage studies in humans and in animal models on a more extensive basis. Using gene technology it is possible to introduce new, additional genes in normotensive and hypertensive animals. It is also possible, in the mouse, to delete or mutate specific genes, and similar technology is being developed for use in the rat. This marks the important transition from classic breeding, the experiments of nature, to \"high tech\" genetics with previously impossible and unparalleled opportunities and the use of this in formation and methodology for clinical medicine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "584": "Sustained essential hypertension is characterised by a progressive decline in renal blood flow and a progressive increase in renal vascular resistance, while glomerular filtration rate remains normal or is reduced to a lesser extent. Renal blood flow is not only decreased per unit square metre of body surface area but also as a fraction of cardiac output. Although the precise mechanism of this renal haemodynamic abnormality remains speculative, the possibility that the renal vasculature plays a role in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension is receiving major attention. Different antihypertensive drugs have different renal haemodynamic effects. Nonselective beta-blockers generally tend to cause a modest decrease in renal blood flow but certain beta-blockers (including those with cardio-selectivity or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) appear to cause less of a reduction in renal haemodynamics than others. Adrenergic blocking agents and diuretics do not produce clinically relevant renal haemodynamic changes, and data obtained with vasodilators are conflicting. Most studies with calcium antagonists show a renal vasodilator response. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase renal blood flow and decrease renovascular resistance in essential hypertension.", 
    "585": "Hypertension is a haemodynamic disorder, reflecting a disturbance in the ratio between cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. In nearly all forms of established hypertension, total peripheral resistance is increased and cardiac output is abnormally low, particularly during exercise. When left untreated, total peripheral resistance increases, cardiac output falls and BP increases over time. The coronary reserve is reduced. Antihypertensive agents affect central haemodynamics differently. Vasodilators like alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors all reduce total peripheral resistance and maintain cardiac output unchanged at rest as well as during exercise. In contrast, beta-blockers do not usually reduce total peripheral resistance much below the pretreatment level, and cardiac output is chronically depressed, particularly during exercise. However, the beta-blockers greatly reduce the workload in the heart by decreasing the rate-pressure product. Recently-developed beta-blockers with vasodilating activity, such as carvedilol, are based on a combination of beta-blockade and vasodilatation. Such beta-blockers also induce marked reduction in pressure-rate product and some reduction in total peripheral resistance. They induce less reduction in cardiac output during exercise than ordinary beta-blockers. From a theoretical point of view, this type of antihypertensive treatment should maintain good BP control, reduce cardiac workload and be associated with fewer side-effects than ordinary beta-blockers.", 
    "586": "The myocardium contains a fibrillar collagen matrix that consists primarily of type I and type III collagens. There is a marked alteration in the ratio and amount of collagen phenotypes in myocardial hypertrophy due to pressure overload. The purpose of the present study is (1) to study the effect of antihypertensive therapy on collagen phenotypes, if instituted before development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and continued into adult life and (2) to study the effects of dissociation of hypertension from hypertrophy, on collagen phenotypes in SHRs. The present study shows the effect of two antihypertensive drugs, hydralazine and captopril, on collagen phenotypes in SHRs. Both hydralazine and captopril effectively controlled blood pressure in SHRs, but only captopril regressed hypertrophy and corrected the altered distribution of myocardial collagen phenotypes I and III. Untreated SHRs had a collagen type I:III ratio of 10.19 +/- 0.27, compared with that of 6.41 +/- 0.30 in normotensive WKY (P < 0.001). Captopril-treated SHRs had a collagen type I:III ratio of 6.75 +/- 0.37, which did not differ significantly from that in normotensive WKY. Hydralazine-treated SHRs had a collagen I:III ratio of 10.07 +/- 0.39, which is similar to the ratio in untreated SHRs. In normotensive rats, neither captopril nor hydralazine significantly altered collagen content or the ratio of type I:III collagen. Thus captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, not only regressed hypertrophy but also reversed the altered distribution of type I and type III collagen whereas hydralazine which effectively controlled blood pressure, did not regress hypertrophy and did not correct the altered distribution in collagen phenotypes. These studies suggest that alteration of collagen phenotypes during hypertensive hypertrophy is independent of blood pressure control and myocardial mass.",

However, their usefulness as an adjunct to drug treatment of hypertension requires further evaluation. In the present study, we examined the influence of dietary sodium and fish oil on the antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Rats were fed experimental diets containing fish oil or olive oil (5% w/w) and low (0.04% w/w) or normal (0.23% w/w) sodium from 1 to 4 months of age. Tail-cuff blood pressure (BP) rose by 8.4 and 4.3 mm Hg/week, respectively, in untreated and enalapril-treated (2.5 mg/kg/day, orally) rats fed the olive oil/normal sodium diet. Feeding fish oil further reduced the rise in enalapril-treated rats to 2.8 mm Hg/week. When sodium intake was also restricted, the BP rise was almost prevented (1.1 mm Hg/week). In older rats with established hypertension, the low sodium/fish oil diet also potentiated the blood pressure reduction by enalapril (tail-cuff BP fell by 61 mm Hg compared to 25 mm Hg with enalapril alone). These observations were confirmed by direct BP recording in conscious rats following the implantation of aortic catheters. Factorial analysis revealed a highly significant antihypertensive effect of fish oil in both young and adult SHRSP receiving enalapril, and a further interactive effect of dietary sodium restriction with fish oil feeding in young rats.

Certain drugs, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, interfere with the natural deactivation of certain vasoactive substances normally present in the body. Since many of these systems are functionally interrelated (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme and kininase II), we may see cutaneous side effects when these drugs are administered. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that promoted a cutaneous eruption in a patient with renal failure secondary to diabetes. We suspect that our patient's vasculitis and maculopapular erythema is included in a large number of polymorphic eruptions that can be seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and review the operative pathogenetic mechanism. Many of these side effects are dose related, and can be controlled or eliminated by lowering the dosage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, depending upon the clinical circumstances.",

Hydralazine (1.5 or 3 mg/kg/day) and captopril (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) were administered to SHR from 19 to 26 weeks of age. Both hydralazine and captopril significantly decreased arterial blood pressure in SHR, but only captopril significantly reduced left ventricular weight. The percentage of V3 myosin isozyme significantly decreased in captopril-treated SHR compared to hydralazine-treated SHR. At the end of long-term treatment, hearts were removed and perfused for 15 min by the working heart technique, and then global ischemia was induced for 30 min. The ischemic heart was reperfused for 30 min. In hydralazine-treated SHR and captopril-treated SHR, the pressure-rate product and extent of recovery of the coronary flow during reperfusion following 30 min of ischemia were higher than those in control SHR, but this difference was significant only in captopril-treated SHR. Hydralazine and captopril treatment improved the restoration of the levels of ATP, creatine phosphate, total adenine nucleotide and energy charge potential in SHR after reperfusion following 30 min of ischemia, but only captopril had a significant effect. In conclusion, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is more important than lowering of blood pressure in order to improve the ischemic myocardial damage.",

The effects on BP control, adverse events, and plasma active renin concentration of removing atenolol from standard triple therapy (bendrofluazide and atenolol together with captopril or nifedipine) were assessed in a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, of eight weeks' duration in 46 patients from the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic. Blood pressures rose in patients randomised to placebo-atenolol compared with those who continued active-atenolol although the difference did not achieve statistical significance. However, the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure (supine systolic BP < 140 mmHg plus supine diastolic BP < 95 mmHg) fell from 31% to 0% over the study period in patients given placebo-atenolol. There was a trend for BP control to deteriorate most when atenolol was withdrawn from nifedipine treated patients, but the 95% confidence intervals for the difference from captopril-treated patients were wide. Few side-effects were seen and these did not differ quantitatively between the study groups. Plasma active renin concentration was initially higher in captopril-treated patients, and increased on withdrawal of atenolol in both groups.

Eighty-five patients in New York Heart Association class II-IV despite treatment with digitalis, diuretics, and captopril (mean dose +/- SEM 28 +/- 2 mg.day-1 at baseline) for > or = 3 months received either 'low dose' captopril (< 75 mg.day-1, mean 32 +/- 2 mg.day-1; n = 46) or 'high dose' captopril (> or = 75 mg.day-1, mean 99 +/- 4 mg.day-1; n = 39) during the follow-up period. Both groups were comparable in clinical, haemodynamic and neurohumoral parameters at baseline. Functional state improved significantly only in the high dose group (P < 0.0001). Of 31 low dose and 20 high dose patients considered as heart transplantation candidates at baseline, 21 low dose and only six high dose patients remained on the waiting list (P < 0.0001). In patients in the low dose group, eight deaths were observed (P < 0.001). Seven patients remained on low dose captopril due to adverse effects. The initially elevated plasma levels of aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide decreased significantly only in high dose patients (P < 0.01). Renin increased significantly in both groups. These observations underline the necessity of suppressing neurohumoral overactivation with adequate doses of captopril reflected by sequential humoral plasma determination.", 
    "599": "To determine whether ventricular short-term enlargement following acute myocardial infarction is related to increased left filling pressures and whether early treatment with captopril alters this process we studied 68 patients with a first acute myocardial infarction. Forty patients with a pulmonary capillary pressure equal or above 17 mmHg were randomized to treatment with conventional therapy plus captopril (n 20) or placebo (n 20), in a double blind fashion. The remaining 28 patients (non-dysfunction group) were treated conventionally. During the first 72 h, afterload showed a prompt decrease in the captopril group as compared to placebo. Changes from baseline to 14 days in end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volume indexes determined by radionuclide ventriculography were: non-dysfunction, 85.6 (+/- 21) vs 88 (+/- 20) and 44 (+/- 17) vs 44 (+/- 17) ml.m-2; captopril (n 20), 96.6 (+/- 18) vs 99 (+/- 19) and 66 (+/- 22) vs 65 (+/- 22) ml.m-2; placebo (n 20), 96 (+/- 25) vs 113 (+/- 19) (P < 0.001) and 63 (+/- 18) vs 74 (+/- 22) ml.m-2 (P < 0.01). This study indicates that short-term ventricular enlargement is related to the degree of ventricular dysfunction and that captopril may improve this process.", 
    "600": "1. The effect of topical betamethasone upon skin blood flow was investigated in the rat. Two types of vasodilator stimuli were used; local heating to the surface of the skin and intradermal application of inflammatory agents. Blood flow was measured by laser doppler velocimetry. 2. Topical betamethasone-17-valerate (1 g with an 18 h pretreatment) significantly inhibited the heat-induced vasodilatation in the rat skin, as also did systemically administered betamethasone (1 mg kg-1, 3 h pretreatment). 3. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril, 5 mg kg-1 and enalapril, 1 mg kg-1, 30 min pretreatments) were the only drugs out of several different types of systemically administered inhibitors and antagonists that were tested which also inhibited the heat-induced vasodilatation. Aprotinin (100,000 KIU kg-1, 5 min pretreatment) a serine protease inhibitor, significantly potentiated the heat-induced response. 4. Bradykinin (50 nmol per site), des-Arg9-bradykinin (5 nmol per site), substance P (0.1 nmol per site) and capsaicin (1 mumol per site) induced an increase in skin blood flow. 5. Topical betamethasone treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of the vasodilator response to des-Arg9-bradykinin, whereas captopril treatment inhibited the responses to substance P, capsaicin, bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin. 6. Intradermal application of captopril (10-100 micrograms) also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the heat-induced vasodilatation. 7. These results suggest that topical betamethasone may be acting in a manner similar to that of the ACE inhibitors to produce an inhibition of the flow responses in the skin and that this effect may be brought about by interfering with the action of vasodilator peptide(s) or protein(s).", 
    "601": "1. This study was designed to investigate whether the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, enalapril and fosinopril have a dose-dependent effect on the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin, PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) by glomeruli isolated from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. 2. Measurements of glomerular prostanoid production were made under basal conditions and in the presence of excess exogenous arachidonic acid. 3. All three ACE inhibitors demonstrated dose-dependent effects upon glomerular prostanoid production which varied with the individual ACE inhibitor. 4. Enalapril induced a dose-dependent increase in the ratio of (PGE2 + PGI2)/TxA2, from 2.17 +/- 0.20 to 5.35 +/- 0.84 and to 10.0 +/- 1.16 with the low and high doses of enalapril respectively. In contrast, the high dose of captopril tended to reduce the ratio when compared to the low dose. 5. The results obtained in this study suggest that although all three ACE inhibitors appear to induce prostacyclin synthetase and/or modulate phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, these effects differ with the ACE inhibitor studied and the dose employed. 6. This study has demonstrated dose-dependent effects of three ACE inhibitors on glomerular prostanoid production which may be significant in modulating glomerular haemodynamics and growth characteristics of glomerular cells.", 
    "602": "To establish that bradykinin is formed in the heart we measured bradykinin in the venous effluent from rat isolated hearts perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. In addition, we examined the effect on bradykinin outflow of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramiprilat. From rat isolated normoxic hearts a bradykinin outflow of 0.85 +/- 0.1 ng ml-1 perfusate g-1 wet weight was measured. Perfusion with ramiprilat increased the bradykinin concentration to 2.8 +/- 0.3 ng ml-1 perfusate g-1 wet weight. During ischaemia bradykinin outflow maximally increased 8.2 fold to 7.0 +/- 0.5 ng ml-1 perfusate g-1, and in ramiprilat-perfused hearts 5.8 fold to 16.0 +/- 1.8 ng ml-1 perfusate g-1. In the reperfusion period bradykinin outflow normalized to values measured in the respective pre-ischaemic period. The presents data show that bradykinin is continuously formed in the rat isolated heart. Ischaemia increases bradykinin outflow from the heart. Presumably by inhibiting degradation of kinins, ACE inhibition significantly increased the bradykinin concentration during normoxia, ischaemia and reperfusion.", 
    "603": "The purpose of this study was to examine the sequential changes in renal and cardiovascular function produced by chronic Benazepril administration at different stages of heart failure in dogs. Heart failure was produced by rapid ventricular pacing in five dogs with a normally functioning renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin normal, AN) and six dogs chronically administered the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) Benazepril. After 7 days of pacing, cardiac output was significantly higher and total peripheral resistance (TPR) lower in the ACEI compared with the AN dogs. Cumulative sodium and water balance increased significantly in both groups, but after 7 days of pacing there were no significant differences between groups. However, the rate of increase in sodium and water balance was significantly less in the ACEI group. Effective renal plasma flow decreased in the AN and ACEI groups during pacing, but there were no between-group differences, and no significant changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) occurred in either group. In the AN dogs, pacing was continued for 7-21 days until the onset of decompensated heart failure. Urinary sodium excretion increased on the first day of ACEI infusion during this stage but returned to pre-ACEI levels during the next 2-3 days. No significant improvement in cardiac output was measured during ACEI in decompensated heart failure. These data suggest that chronic ACEI administration can improve renal and cardiac function in early heart failure without impairing GFR but is less chronic ACEI administration can improve renal and cardiac function in early heart failure without impairing GFR but is less effective in later, decompensated stages.", 
    "604": "In 13 decerebrate cats, we studied the effects of captopril (10 mg/kg iv bolus) on the background discharge of thoracic preganglionic sympathetic fibers. After drug administration there was an initial reduction in systolic arterial pressure (SAP), which was followed by a later inhibition of sympathetic discharge (from 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 0.79 +/- 0.1 imp/0.1 s; P < 0.01). Captopril significantly reduced the excitatory response of sympathetic fibers to premature ventricular contraction (70 +/- 17 vs. 257 +/- 30%), inferior vena cava obstruction (176 +/- 56 vs. 315 +/- 85%) and asphyxia (143 +/- 20 vs. 245 +/- 51%). Vice versa the sympathetic response to aortic occlusion was unaffected (-58 +/- 8 vs. -62 +/- 6%). A similar reduction in sympathetic discharge was observed after captopril administration in anesthetized cats (n = 3). On the contrary, no changes in background neural discharge were noticed in decerebrate-spinalized cats (n = 5), despite comparable hemodynamic effects. These data indicate that captopril reduces sympathetic efferent activity and its responsiveness to excitatory stimuli. The lack of neural effects in decerebrate-spinalized cats is consistent with a brain stem site of action of captopril.", 
    "605": "1. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of trandolapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with an active metabolite, trandolaprilat, which is in part further metabolised prior to renal elimination, were evaluated in 31 subjects with a wide range of renal function (creatinine clearance 4-112 ml min-1 1.73 m-2). 2. The pharmacokinetics of trandolapril were unaffected by differences in renal function. 3. In contrast, there was a close correlation between the renal clearance (0-96 h) of trandolaprilat and creatinine clearance (r = 0.95, P = 0.0001). The maximum plasma concentration of trandolaprilat, and the area under the concentration curve (0-96 h) correlated inversely with creatinine clearance (r = -0.59, P < 0.001; and r = -0.61, P < 0.001 respectively). 4. Significant changes in plasma trandolaprilat concentrations were seen only in patients with creatinine clearances of 30 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 or less, suggesting that a dose reduction in trandolapril might be advisable in severe renal impairment. 5. However, the majority of parameters of ACE inhibition were unrelated to creatinine clearance, although area under the curve for ACE inhibition (0-336 h) showed a weak negative correlation (r = -0.49, P < 0.01). Similarly, weighted mean changes in blood pressure were not influenced by renal function. 6. Therefore, while the pharmacokinetic parameters of trandolaprilat correlated with creatinine clearance, pharmacodynamic measurements (ACE inhibition and blood pressure changes) in general showed no such relationship, indicating that dose adjustment of ACE inhibitors in renal impairment should be based on pharmacokinetic results only in conjunction with pharmacodynamic data.", 
    "606": "1. Forty patients with moderate to severe hypertension and daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg were randomized double-blind to once-daily treatment with either quinapril up to 20 mg (n = 20) or atenolol up to 100 mg (n = 20) as single drugs or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg over a period of 12 weeks. 2. Conventional and ambulatory blood pressure, heart rate, side effects and metabolic changes were compared at the end of the run-in period on placebo, after 4 weeks on monotherapy and at the end of the 12-week period of active treatment. 3. Quinapril and atenolol reduced conventional blood pressure equally with substantial additional effect seen on combination therapy. The two regimens induced a significant decrease in ambulatory BP. However, the atenolol treated ambulatory hypertensive group experienced significantly greater decreases in diastolic blood pressure during 24 h, awake and sleep periods than did the quinapril group. 4. Adverse reactions were mild with both drugs except for severe Raynaud phenomenon in one patient in the atenolol group. Triglyceride levels were significantly increased with atenolol alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. 5. Thus, within the limits of the dose ranges tested, quinapril and atenolol as single drugs or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide reduce significantly conventional and ambulatory blood pressure in moderate to severe hypertensives, but atenolol is more effective in reducing ambulatory diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "607": "1. The aim of the study was to investigate whether there were differential effects of three different anti-hypertensive medications (cilazapril, atenolol, nifedipine) on cognitive function. 2. A sub-group of patients participating in a large clinical trial of these three drugs, randomly allocated between the three drug conditions, received cognitive assessment at two points before the commencement of treatment and then after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Seventy-six patients began treatment, and 55 completed the full course. 3. Tests of learning and memory were designed specially for the study, with a different but comparable version administered on each assessment occasion, in a fixed order. 4. No significant differences between drug groups were found in any index of learning or memory, at any testing occasion. The results were the same whether or not treatment non-completers were included in the analysis.", 
    "608": "The influence of chronic perindopril treatment on digoxin pharmacokinetics was investigated in 10 patients with mild chronic heart failure under stable diuretic and digitalis treatment and normal renal function. Digoxin was administered at a dose of 0.125 mg/day (n = 2) or 0.250 mg/day (n = 8). The 24-hour steady-state digoxin profile was assessed before and after concomitant administration of perindopril for 1 month at doses of 2 mg once a day for the first 8 days and 4 mg once a day for the remaining 21 days. Chronic treatment with perindopril produced no significant effect on mean (+/- standard deviation) digoxin serum area under the curve for 24 hours (17.9 +/- 7.4 versus 16.3 +/- 4.4 ng/mL.h), peak digoxin concentration (1.3 +/- 0.54 versus 1.2 +/- 0.36 ng/mL), time to peak concentration (3 versus 4 hours), and apparent oral clearance of digoxin (237.7 +/- 109.6 versus 237.4 +/- 79.5 mL/min). Clinical and biologic tolerance of perindopril was good throughout the study. Chronic administration of perindopril did not alter steady-state digoxin kinetics in patients with mild chronic heart failure and normal renal function, indicating that no adaptation of the digoxin dose is required during co-prescription with perindopril in such patients.",

    "612": "All applicable animal and human trials were reviewed.", 
    "613": "Advances in the management of heart failure have led to new insights into the complex pathophysiology of this condition, particularly the favorable clinical effects noted with the ACE inhibitors. The net effect of ACE inhibitors on the renin-angiotensin system in patients with heart failure is to augment renal blood flow to a greater extent than cardiac output. Glomerular filtration rate is either unchanged or decreased by ACE inhibition. Sodium excretion is augmented primarily by alterations in glomerular hemodynamic parameters. ACE inhibitors may alter renal tubular function, both directly and indirectly, leading to increased diuresis and natriuresis.", 
    "614": "Although ACE inhibitors exert beneficial pharmacodynamic effects on the renal bed in patients with heart failure, clinical consideration of volume and neurohormonal status prior to institution of therapy is prudent."
