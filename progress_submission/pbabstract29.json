The rationale for this suggestion is the high fiber and low soluble carbohydrate content of eggplant. We propose that a more physiologically relevant explanation lies in the phenolic-linked antioxidant activity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory potential of eggplant which could reduce hyperglycemia-induced pathogenesis. Results from this study indicate that phenolic-enriched extracts of eggplant with moderate free radical scavenging-linked antioxidant activity had high alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity and in specific cases moderate to high angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Inhibition of these enzymes provide a strong biochemical basis for management of type 2 diabetes by controlling glucose absorption and reducing associated hypertension, respectively. This phenolic antioxidant-enriched dietary strategy also has the potential to reduce hyperglycemia-induced pathogenesis linked to cellular oxidation stress. These results provide strong rationale for further animal and clinical studies.",

    "24": "High blood pressure (BP) is the major cardiovascular risk factor and the main cause of death around the world. Control of blood pressure reduces the high mortality associated with hypertension and the most recent guidelines recommend reducing arterial BP values below 140/90 mmHg for all hypertensive patients (130/80 in diabetics) as a necessary step to reduce global cardiovascular risk, which is the fundamental objective of the treatment. To achieve these target BP goals frequently requires combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive agents. Although the combination of a diuretic and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is the most commonly used in the clinical practice, the combination of an ACEI and a calcium channel blocker may have an additive antihypertensive effect, a favorable effect on the metabolic profile, and an increased target organ damage protection. The new oral fixed combination manidipine 10 mg/delapril 30 mg has a greater antihypertensive effect than both components of the combination separately, and in non-responders to monotherapy with manidipine or delapril the average reduction of systolic and diastolic BP is 16/10 mmHg. The combination is well tolerated and the observed adverse effects are of the same nature as those observed in patients treated with the components as monotherapy. However, combination therapy reduces the incidence of ankle edema in patients treated with manidipine.", 
    "25": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor blockers lower proteinuria and preserve renal function in diabetic nephropathy (DN). The antiproteinuric effects are greater than their blood pressure reduction, involving the sieving properties of the glomerular filter. In DN, glomerular staining for heparan sulfate proteoglycans is decreased. AngII inhibits heparan sulfate synthesis. Also, heparins modulate AngII signaling in glomerular cells, inhibiting aldosterone synthesis and lowering proteinuria in DN. Is the antiproteinuric effect of heparins due to its interference with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system? Ten volunteers each with DN and glomerulonephritis and control subjects were examined before and after low-dosage enoxaparin. Renal hemodynamics were determined with (99m)Tc-DTPA and (131)I-hippurate clearance. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were measured at baseline and during AngII infusion before and after enoxaparin while on normal salt and salt restriction. Enoxaparin did not lower aldosterone levels. GFR remained stable in all groups. AngII caused a significant decrease in effective renal plasma flow, whereas mean arterial pressure and heart rate increased significantly. Enoxaparin did not influence the AngII-induced changes of renal hemodynamics during normal salt intake or salt restriction. All groups showed identical responses to AngII before and after enoxaparin. In patients with diabetes, enoxaparin caused a significant decrease in proteinuria. It is concluded that the antiproteinuric effect of heparins in DN cannot be explained via interaction with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The absence of hemodynamic changes combined with reduced proteinuria point to intrinsic alterations in the glomerular filter. The effects were seen only in DN, not in glomerulonephritis.", 
    "26": "Previous studies that have evaluated fish oil preparations in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) have produced a wide range of conclusions. Proposed explanations for these discordant results have not provided a unifying hypothesis. Results from two clinical trials were analyzed to examine whether there is a dosage-dependent effect of Omacor, a purified preparation of omega-3 fatty acids, in patients with IgAN. Whether changes in the level of proteinuria and plasma phospholipid fatty acid profiles were dependent on the dose of Omacor factored by body size was determined. In a post hoc analysis of the first trial results, correlations were found between (1) phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/AA ratios and the dosage of Omacor, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight (r = 0.78, P < 0.001 for EPA/AA; r = 0.86, P < 0.001 for DHA/AA), (2) phospholipid EPA/AA and DHA/AA levels and percentage change in urine protein/creatinine ratio after 21 to 24 mo of therapy (r = -0.50, P = 0.02 for EPA/AA; r = -0.52, P = 0.01 for DHA/AA), and (3) dosage of Omacor per kilogram of body weight and change in proteinuria after 21 to 24 mo (r = -0.50, P = 0.02). A similar relationship was observed between urine protein/creatinine ratio and dosage of Omacor per kilogram of body weight in trial 2 (r = -0.38, P < 0.001). It is concluded from these data that the effect of Omacor on proteinuria in patients with IgAN is dosage dependent and is associated with a dosage-dependent effect of Omacor on plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA levels.", 
    "27": "Several studies have found reduced use of recommended medications after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with impaired kidney function. However, the reasons for such undertreatment are not well understood. A total of 1380 Medicare patients who survived at least 90 d after MI and had prescription drug coverage through Pennsylvania's medication assistance program for the elderly were studied. Filled prescriptions were used to assess use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta blockers, and statins within 90 d of MI. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, and health care utilization before MI also were ascertained. We used logistic regression to test the association between kidney function and postdischarge use of each medication. Overall, 619 (45%) patients filled a prescription for a beta blocker, 675 (49%) received an ACEI or ARB, and 406 (29%) received a statin after discharge but within 90 d after their admission for MI. Reduced kidney function was associated with both lower beta blocker and statin use (P = 0.01 and P = 0.002, respectively), but after multivariate adjustment, these associations disappeared (P = 0.23 and P = 0.62, respectively). Use of ACEI or ARB was nearly half in patients with estimated GFR <30 ml/min compared with patients with better kidney function in univariate and multivariate analyses (P < 0.001). Analyses using serum creatinine measurements rather than estimations of GFR yielded similar results. Differences in other characteristics such as age, rather than kidney function, may be responsible for much or all the reported reduction in use of preventive medications after MI seen in patients with chronic kidney disease.", 
    "28": "The benefit of the add-on angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in inhibition of progression of nephropathy in hypertensive patient with nondiabetic renal disease compared with monotherapy with ACE inhibitors remains controversial. All patients were previously treated with ACE inhibitors. Urinary protein excretion of patients exceeded 1.0 g/d despite treatment with ACE inhibitors. Ninety hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received ACE inhibitor plus candesartan (2 to 12 mg/d), and a control group received only ACE inhibitor. The target BP was < or = 130/80 mmHg. The primary outcome was the changes in serum creatinine and the reduction of proteinuria. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.1 +/- 0.4 yr. At years 2 and 3, systolic and diastolic BP were reduced from 140 +/- 3/84 +/- 2 to 129 +/- 1/78 +/- 2 mmHg (candesartan group) and from 135 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 to 130 +/- 2/80 +/- 2 mmHg (ACE inhibitors group). In both groups, both systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly from the beginning to the end of the study (P < 0.01). The serum creatinine concentration increased from 3.02 +/- 0.27 to 3.38 +/- 0.49 mg/dl (candesartan plus ACE inhibitor group) versus 3.00 +/- 0.37 to 4.48 +/- 0.57 mg/dl (ACE inhibitor group; P < 0.01) at year 3. Although the level of proteinuria significantly declined in each group (P < 0.05), the degree of reductions in proteinuria was greater in the candesartan group than in the ACE inhibitors group (P < 0.01). In the patients who were treated with candesartan and ACE inhibitor or ACE inhibitor alone, pretreatment proteinuria correlated significantly with decline of renal function, whereas reduction of proteinuria negatively correlated with decline in renal function in the patients who were treated with candesartan. Candesartan with an ACE inhibitor is effective in slowing the progression of renal insufficiency in hypertensive patients with nondiabetic renal disease through reduction of proteinuria.", 
    "29": "Studies have shown that dual therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and either angiotensin II receptor blockers or aldosterone receptor antagonists is more effective in reducing proteinuria than either agent used alone. The questions that remain are as follows: (1) Which of these agents should be used as dual therapy with the ACEI? (2) Does a higher level of blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with triple therapy offer an advantage over dual blockade? A 3-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 41 patients with proteinuria >1.5 g/d. Four treatment groups were compared: (1) Ramipril + spironolactone placebo + irbesartan placebo, (2) ramipril + irbesartan + spironolactone placebo, (3) ramipril + irbesartan placebo + spironolactone, and (4) ramipril + irbesartan + spironolactone. The percentage change in protein excretion differed according to treatment arm (ANOVA: F(3,35) = 8.6, P < 0.001). Pair-wise comparison showed that greater reduction in protein excretion occurred in treatment regimens that incorporated spironolactone. The reduction in proteinuria at 3 mo was as follows: Group 1, 1.4%; group 2, 15.7%; group 3, 42.0%; and group 4, 48.2%. The reduction in proteinuria among patients who were taking spironolactone-containing regimens was sustained at 6 and 12 mo. This study suggests that aldosterone receptor blockade offers a valuable adjuvant treatment when used with ACEI therapy for the reduction of proteinuria. Results suggest no advantage of triple blockade over dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to reduce proteinuria.", 
    "30": "The Joint National Committee and the World Health Organization are in agreement that hypertension in most patients who are treated is controlled inadequately and that rates of cardiovascular morbidity remain high. Additional pharmacologic treatments could ameliorate this situation. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been a highly successful pharmacologic target, as the system is strongly implicated in the development of hypertension-related target organ damage. However, compensatory increases in plasma renin levels that lead to adjustments in angiotensin production and conversion present limitations for existing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. A once-daily, orally effective, small-molecule renin inhibitor, aliskiren, is now available to address angiotensin production directly at its rate-limiting step. Studies in humans attest to an effective BP-lowering effect, a side effect profile no different from AT1 receptor blockers, and the option of combination therapies. A novel animal model of high human renin hypertension in the rat attest to target organ protection. Because angiotensin receptor blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, calcium channel blockade, and diuretic therapy all lead to sharp increases in plasma renin activity, aliskiren offers a novel circumvention.", 
    "31": "There is limited information on potentially adverse lisinopril ingestions reported to poison control centers. Using adult lisinopril ingestions reported to Texas poison control centers during 1998-2005, the proportion of cases involving serious outcomes was determined for selected variables and evaluated for statistical significance by calculating the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Of 468 cases identified, 43 (9%) involved serious outcomes. The severity of the outcome associated with adult lisinopril ingestions depended on the dose and the circumstances of the ingestion. Thus, serious outcomes were significantly more likely to occur with a maximum dose >80 mg (RR 5.69, CI 2.43-13.33) or, if the dose was unknown, > or =3 tablets (RR 9.57, CI 2.39-54.97), where the circumstances of the exposures involved self-harm or malicious intent (RR 6.96, CI 3.65-13.31), or the patient was already at or en route to a health care facility when the poison control center was contacted (RR 7.33, CI 3.09-17.85) or referred to a health care facility by the poison control center (RR 23.76, CI 10.62-55.67). The management of patients with severe outcomes was more likely to involve health care facilities. Such information is useful for creating of triage guidelines for the management of adult lisinopril ingestions.", 
    "32": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the renoprotective effect of telmisartan on the advanced stages of nephropathy in rats with 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx). Telmisartan was orally administered for 12 weeks to rats that previously underwent 5/6 Nx or sham operations. After completion of the administration period, the degree of renal injury was examined histopathologically using indices of glomerulosclerosis and lesions of the renal tubule and interstitium. An immunohistochemical staining for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) was also performed. The suppression of urinary protein was statistically significant in surviving animals dosed with telmisartan. The enalapril group's urinary protein was also significantly suppressed for these same parameters in surviving animals. Histopathologically, telmisartan significantly decreased the progression of glomerulosclerosis and the interstitial cell infiltration at all doses tested. As assessed by immunohistochemical staining the TGF-beta1 reactivity in the glomerular tissue tended to decrease in the telmisartan group when compared to the vehicle group. Thus, telmisartan ameliorates the progressive nephropathy in the remaining kidney after 5/6 Nx by non-haemodynamic as well as antihypertensive actions of the drug.", 
    "33": "Renin system blockade in diabetes exerts a strong positive influence on complications, especially nephropathy. In hyperglycaemic diabetic subjects, however, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors results in a marked rise in plasma renin. We investigated whether glycaemic fluctuations measured in hours, or those measured in weeks by Haemoglobin A(1C) (HbA(1C)) , influenced the plasma renin response to captopril. Fifty-four type 1 diabetic subjects were studied in high-salt balance. After an all night fast and in the supine position, baseline serum glucose level was drawn. Iv. glucose and insulin were then administered to keep serum glucose between 100 and 150 mg/dL (target). When target was reached, captopril 25 mg pre os was administered and plasma renin activity (PRA) and finger stick glucose were drawn, then serially every 45 minutes for 225 minutes. Baseline glucose and baseline PRA were drawn hours apart. Peak PRA corresponded to the renin level at peak captopril effect, 90' after administration. Renin response (RR) = peak PRA - baseline PRA. Correlation of baseline glucose with baseline PRA was weak (r=0.3, p=0.02), but strong with peak PRA (r=0.65; p=0.002). Drop in glucose had a weak, negative correlation with baseline PRA (r=-0.3, p=0.03) but a much stronger one with peak PRA (r=-0.7, p<0.0001). After adjustment for baseline PRA and baseline glucose, mean RR correlated strongly with mean drop in glucose (r=-0.72; p=0.008). Conversely, HbA1C correlated with none of the measures of renin system activation (r=0.05;p=0.7). In type 1 diabetic subjects, short-term hyperglycaemia, but not long-term glycaemic control, enhanced the RR to captopril.",

    "35": "Histology and immunochemistry were used to demonstrate the presence of Ang (1-7) and ACE 2 in the ventricle of cardiomyopathic hamsters. Measurements of transmembrane potentials, conduction velocity and refractoriness were made using conventional intracellular microelectrodes. The influence of Ang (1-7) on sodium pump current was investigated in voltageclamped myocytes isolated from the ventricle.", 
    "36": "The results indicated the presence of Ang (1-7) and ACE 2 in myocytes of cardiomyopathic hamsters. Moreover,Ang (1-7) (10(-8) M) hyperpolarised the heart cell, increased the conduction velocity, and reduced transiently the action potential duration. The cardiac refractoriness was also increased by the heptapeptide, an effect in part reduced by an inhibitor of mas receptor. These findings indicate that Ang (1-7) has important antiarrhythmic properties. However, the beneficial effects of Ang (1-7) are dose-dependent because at higher concentration (10(-7) M) the heptapeptide elicited an appreciable increase of action potential duration and early-after depolarisations. Since losartan (10(-7) M) did not counteract this effect of the high dose of the heptapeptide, it is possible to conclude that activation of AT(1)-receptors is not involved in this effect of Ang (1-7). To investigate the mechanism of the hyperpolarising action of Ang (1-7) the influence of the heptapeptide on the sodium potassium pump current was studied in myocytes isolated from the ventricle of cardiomyopathic hamsters. The peak pump current density was measured under voltage clamp using the whole cell configuration. The results indicated that Ang (1-7) (10(-8) M) enhanced the electrogenic sodium pump, an effect suppressed by ouabain (10(-7) M).", 
    "37": "Ang (1-7) has beneficial effects on the failing heart by activating the sodium pump, hyperpolarising the cell membrane and increasing the conduction velocity. These effects as well as the increment of refractoriness indicate that Ang (1-7) has antiarrhythmic properties.

    "48": "Of the 166,018 patients in the described cohort, 1819 (1%) were prescribed a combination therapy tablet as their first-line therapy. The number of patients prescribed antihypertensive polytherapy within the first two years of diagnosis increased from 2071 (21%) of the 9825 hypertensive patients starting treatment in the second half of 1994 to 2578 (37%) of the 6988 hypertensive patients beginning treatment in the first quarter of 2002 (P<0.0001). Overall, 11,003 (27%) of polytherapy prescriptions were for drugs without additive hypotensive effects when combined and this proportion did not change over time.", 
    "49": "Although there has been an increase in the use of polytherapy in elderly hypertensive patients without comorbidities in Ontario over the past decade, more than one-quarter of the two drugs prescribed together have not been proven to have additive hypotensive effects.

    "50": "To explore the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on endothelial dysfunction induced by homocysteine thiolactone (HTL). Both endothelium-dependent relaxation and nondependent relaxation of thoracic aortic rings in rats induced by acetylcholine (Ach) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and biochemical parameters including malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in rat isolated aorta. Exposure of aortic rings to HTL (3 to 30 mM) for 90 minutes made a significant inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by Ach, decreased contents of NO, and increased MDA concentration in aortic tissue. After incubation of aortic rings with captopril (0.003 to 0.03 mM) attenuated the inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) and significantly resisted the decrease of NO content and elevation of MDA concentration caused by HTL (30 mmol/L) in aortic tissues, a similarly protective effect was observed when the aortic rings were incubated with both N-acetylcysteine (0.05 mM). Treatment with enalaprilat (0.003 to 0.01 mM) made no significant difference with the HTL (30 mM) group regarding EDR, but enalaprilat (0.03 mM) and losartan (0.03 mM) could partly restore the EDR in response to HTL (30 mM). Captopril was more effective than enalaprilat and losartan in attenuation of the inhibition of on acetylcholine-stimulated aortic relaxation by HTL in the same concentration. Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD, 200 U/mL), which is a scavenger of superoxide anions, apocynin (0.03 mM), which is an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, and l-Arginine (3 mmol/L), a precursor of nitric oxide (NO), could reduce HTL (30 mM)-induced inhibition of EDR. After pretreatment with not only the NO synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 0.01 mM) but also the free sulfhydryl group blocking agent p-hydroxymercurybenzoate (PHMB, 0.05 mM) could abolish the protection of captopril and N-acetylcysteine, respectively. These results suggest that mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction induced by HTL may include the decrease of NO and the generation of oxygen free radicals and that captopril can restore the inhibition of EDR induced by HTL in isolated rat aorta, which may be related to scavenging oxygen free radicals and may be sulfhydryl-dependent.", 
    "51": "The discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in 2000 is an important event in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) story. This enzyme, an homolog of ACE, hydrolyzes angiotensin (Ang) I to produce Ang-(1-9), which is subsequently converted into Ang-(1-7) by a neutral endopeptidase and ACE. ACE2 releases Ang-(1-7) more efficiently than its catalysis of Ang-(1-9) by cleavage of Pro(7)-Phe(8) bound in Ang II. Thus, the major biologically active product of ACE2 is Ang-(1-7), which is considered to be a beneficial peptide of the RAS cascade in the cardiovascular system. This enzyme has 42% identity with the catalytic domain of ACE, is present in most cardiovascular-relevant tissues, and is an ectoenzyme as ACE. Despite these similarities, ACE2 is distinct from ACE. Since it is a monocarboxypeptidase, it has only 1 catalytic site and is insensitive to ACE inhibitors. As a result, ACE2 is a central enzyme in balancing vasoconstrictor and proliferative actions of Ang II with vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects of Ang-(1-7). In this review, we will summarize the role of ACE2 in the cardiovascular system and discuss the importance of ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis in the control of normal cardiovascular physiology and ACE2 as a potential target in the development of novel therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases.",

The increase in UAE during follow-up is associated with greater CV and renal risks in type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects; its decrease during follow-up is associated with lower risks. IN NON-DIABETIC SUBJECTS: Microalbuminuria is a marker of increased risk for diabetes mellitus, deterioration of renal function, CV morbidity and all-cause mortality. It is a marker of increased risk for the development of hypertension in normotensive subjects, and is associated with unfavorable outcome in patients with cancer and lymphoma. Persistence of elevated UAE during follow-up is associated with poor outcome in some hypertensive subjects. Measurement of UAE may be recommended in hypertensive medium-risk subjects with 1 or 2 CV risk factors in whom CV risk remains difficult to assess, and in those with refractory hypertension: microalbuminuria indicates a high CV risk and must lead to strict control of arterial pressure. Studies focused on microalbuminuria in non-diabetic non-hypertensive subjects are limited; most of them suggest that microalbuminuria predicts CV complications and deleterious outcome. Subjects with a history of CV or cerebrovascular disease have an even greater CV risk if microalbuminuria is present than if it is not; however, in all cases, therapeutic intervention must be aggressive regardless of whether microalbuminuria is present or not. It is not recommended to measure UAE in non-diabetic non-hypertensive subjects in the absence of history of renal disease.

    "56": "Renal impairment is frequent in aged diabetic patients, notably with type 2 diabetes. It results from a multifactorial pathogeny, particularly the combined actions of hyperglycaemia, arterial hypertension and ageing. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality. DN often leads to end stage renal failure (ESRF) which causes specific problems of decision and practical organization of extra-renal epuration in diabetic and aged patients. In the absence of renal biopsy, clinical signs are often insufficient to assess the diabetic origin of a nephropathy in an elderly diabetic patient. Prevention of DN is principally based on tight glycaemic and blood pressure control. The progression of renal lesions can be retarded by strict blood pressure control, notably by blocking of the renin-angiotensin system, if well tolerated in aged patients. It is absolutely necessary to avoid the worsening of renal lesions by potentially nephrotoxic products, notably non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and iodinated contrast media. At the stage of renal failure, it is important to adapt the antidiabetic treatment, and in the majority of the cases, to switch to insulin when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 30 ml/mn/1.73 m2.",

The theoretical therapeutic advantages for inhibiting the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin system at its most upstream point have served as the impetus for the development of renin inhibitors. The advent of aliskiren, the first in a novel class of orally active, nonpeptide, highly specific, human renin inhibitors, provides a new modality in the armamentarium of renin-angiotensin system antagonists. Studies in marmosets and rats demonstrated that aliskiren reduced blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner and is highly efficacious in blocking plasma renin activity with parallel reductions in the levels of the other downstream constituents of the renin-angiotensin system. Clinical trials in hypertensive patients have confirmed these benefits with aliskiren whose blood pressure-lowering efficacy is similar to or better than those of standard therapeutic doses of enalapril, losartan, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is well tolerated, with few reported adverse effects even at the highest doses tested. Given the established beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the treatment of cardiovascular and renovascular diseases, future studies may further elucidate a similar protective role for aliskiren both as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy.", 
    "68": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common postoperative arrhythmia with significant consequences on patient health. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) complicates up to 8% of all noncardiac surgeries, between 3% and 30% of noncardiac thoracic surgeries, and between 16% and 46% of cardiac surgeries. POAF has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and longer, more costly hospital stays. The risk of POAF after cardiac and noncardiac surgery may be affected by several epidemiologic and intraoperative factors, as well as by the presence of preexisting cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. POAF is typically a transient, reversible phenomenon that may develop in patients who possess an electrophysiologic substrate for the arrhythmia that is present before or as a result of surgery. Numerous studies support the efficacy of beta-blockers in POAF prevention; they are currently the most common medication used in POAF prophylaxis. Perioperative amiodarone, sotalol, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and magnesium sulfate have been associated with a reduction in the occurrence of POAF. Biatrial pacing is a nonpharmacologic method that has been associated with a reduced risk of POAF. Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors may decrease the risk of POAF. Finally, based on recent evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the risk of permanent atrial fibrillation, these medications may also hold promise in POAF prophylaxis. However, there is a need for further large-scale investigations that incorporate standard methodologies and diagnostic criteria, which have been lacking in past trials.",

    "78": "To reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), management strategies are increasingly focusing on preventive measures following early detection of markers of atherosclerosis. This review focuses on microalbuminuria, which is gaining recognition as a simple marker of an atherogenic milieu. Prospective and epidemiologic studies have found that microalbuminuria is predictive, independently of traditional risk factors, of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and CVD events within groups of patients with diabetes or hypertension, and in the general population. The pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the association between albumin excretion and CVD is not fully defined. One hypothesis is that microalbuminuria may be a marker of CVD risk because it reflects subclinical vascular damage in the kidneys and other vascular beds. It may also signify systemic endothelial dysfunction that predisposes to future cardiovascular events. Based on this theory, periodic screening for microalbuminuria could allow early identification of vascular disease and help stratify overall cardiovascular risk, especially in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes. A positive test for urinary albumin excretion could signify the need for an intensive multifactorial intervention strategy, including behavior modification and targeted pharmacotherapy, aimed at preventing further renal deterioration and improving the overall CVD risk factor profile. Data from intervention studies suggest that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, and/or strict glycemic control (in diabetics) offer significant reductions in cardiovascular and/or renal morbidity in patients with albuminuria. Use of this (old) marker may allow improved use of medications and strategies for secondary prevention.", 
    "79": "Cardiac arrest (CA) is the most common cause of death in hemodialysis patients, and factors that improve survival after arrest are unknown. This study sought to identify modifiable factors that are associated with survival after CA in hemodialysis clinics. Patients who experienced in-center CA in the Gambro Healthcare System in the United States from 2002 to 2005 were identified. Patient characteristics at the time of arrest were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors at 24 h and 6 mo after CA. A total of 729 patients sustained in-clinic CA; 310 (42.5%) patients survived 24 h, and 80 (11%) patients survived 6 mo. Traditional risk factors, including cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, hemoglobin, and dialysis adequacy, did not predict survival at either time point. After adjustment for case-mix factors, presence of indwelling catheter, and concomitant medications, only use of beta blockers (BBL), calcium-channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) remained significantly associated with survival (BBL odds ratio [OR] 0.32 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.61]; CCB OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.23 to 0.76]; ACEI/ARB OR 0.51 [95% CI 0.28 to 0.95]). The beneficial effect of ACEI/ARB and BBL on survival increased sequentially with higher medication dosages. Prescription of BBL at the time of the event was the only predictive variable of survival at 24 h. Therefore, traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with survival after CA in this hemodialysis cohort. The benefits that are associated with BBL, CCB, and ACEI/ARB suggest that these medications may improve the chances of survival after CA.", 
    "80": "The aims of this study were to assess the frequency and determinants of (1) treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and (2) progression to proteinuria in the presence of ACE-I treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria. A clinic-based cohort study of patients with type 1 diabetes was begun in 1991. The patients who were included in this study (n = 373) are the cohort members who received a diagnosis of microalbuminuria during a 2-yr baseline observation and were followed for 10 yr with frequent assessments of urinary albumin excretion and biennial examinations. Progression to proteinuria occurred when the median urinary albumin excretion during a 2-yr interval exceeded 299 mug/min. During the decade-long study, the proportion of patients who had a history of microalbuminuria and were treated with ACE-I rose from 17 to 67%. Patients who started this treatment had (on average) higher BP, higher urinary albumin excretion, and longer diabetes duration than those who did not. Microalbuminuria often progressed to proteinuria (6.3/100 person-years) in those who were treated. Poor glycemic control and elevated serum cholesterol were the major determinants/predictors of this progression. Although treatment with ACE-I increased during the past decade, it was not completely effective, because microalbuminuria progressed to proteinuria in many treated patients. Poor glycemic control and elevated serum cholesterol were the major determinants/predictors for progression while on ACE-I treatment. The mechanisms that are responsible for the frequent failure of ACE-I to prevent progression of microalbuminuria to proteinuria in a clinical setting are not clear.",

Risk factors and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) after gastric bypass surgery are not well understood, however. A total of 504 patients underwent gastric bypass between January 2003 and 2005. Primary outcome was AKI, defined as a > or =50% increase in serum creatinine relative to baseline or requirement of dialysis. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, all-cause hospital mortality, and readmissions within 30 d after surgery. Demographic, comorbid, and laboratory variables and preoperative medication use were examined as potential risk factors for AKI. A total of 42 (8.5%) patients developed postoperative AKI. Hyperlipidemia, preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), intraoperative hypotension, and higher body mass index were associated with increased frequency of AKI. By multivariable analyses, the independent risk factors for AKI were body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.06), hyperlipidemia (OR 2.53; 95% CI 1.21 to 5.28), and preoperative use of ACE-I or ARB (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.05 to 4.04). The postoperative mortality was 0.45% (n = 2), both of whom had AKI. Duration of hospitalization was greater in patients with AKI versus no AKI (4.0 versus 2.7 d; P = 0.0003). Postoperative AKI is not infrequent after gastric bypass surgery. Certain comorbid conditions and their commonly prescribed treatments, ACE-I or ARB, are independently associated with increased risk for postoperative AKI.", 
    "82": "Recent guidelines for management of patients with chronic kidney disease recommend both lower optimal BP targets and agents that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) for specific additional BP-independent renoprotection. Although there are other compelling rationales to use RAS blockade in patients with chronic kidney disease, including its antihypertensive effectiveness and ability to counteract the adverse effects of diuretics, a critical review of the available scientific evidence suggests that the specificity of renoprotection that is provided by RAS blockade has been greatly overemphasized. Little evidence of truly BP-independent renoprotection is observed in experimental animal models when ambient BP is assessed adequately by chronic continuous BP radiotelemetry. Although the clinical trial evidence is somewhat stronger, nevertheless, even when interpreted favorably, the absolute magnitude of the BP-independent component of the renoprotection that is observed with RAS blockade is much smaller than what is due to its antihypertensive effects.",

This study was conducted to ascertain whether lower doses of eplerenone (50 or 100 mg/d) co-administered with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril would produce a similar antialbuminuric effect while obviating the hyperkalemia observed previously. After open-label run-in with enalapril 20 mg/d, patients with diabetes and a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) > or = 50 mg/g were randomly assigned to receive enalapril plus one of three double-blind daily treatments for 12 wk: placebo, eplerenone 50 mg (EPL50), or eplerenone 100 mg (EPL100). After week 4, amlodipine 2.5 to 10 mg/d was allowed for BP control (systolic/diastolic BP < or = 130/80 mmHg). The primary study end points were the percentage change from baseline at week 12 in UACR and the incidence of hyperkalemia. Secondary end points included percentage changes from baseline in UACR at weeks 4 and 8 and changes from baseline in systolic and diastolic BP. Treatment with EPL50 or EPL100 but not placebo significantly reduced albuminuria from baseline. By week 12, UACR was reduced by 7.4% in the placebo group, by 41.0% in the EPL50 group, and by 48.4% in the EPL100 group (both eplerenone groups, P < 0.001 versus placebo). The incidences of sustained and severe hyperkalemia were not significantly different in any of the three treatment arms and did not differ on the basis of quartile of estimated GFR (all NS). For the secondary end points, both eplerenone treatment groups significantly reduced albuminuria from baseline as early as week 4 (P < 0.001), whereas placebo treatment (including enalapril) did not result in any significant decreases in UACR. Systolic BP decreased significantly in all treatment groups at all time points, but, generally, all treatment groups experienced similar decreases in BP. Co-administration of EPL50 or EPL100 with an ACE inhibitor as compared with an ACE inhibitor alone significantly reduces albuminuria in patients with diabetes without producing significant increases in hyperkalemia.",

Ironically, in some cases, the biologic pathways that have protected the heart during acute dysfunction are the same pathways that cause progressive deleterious effects with chronic activation. In particular, it is the activation of the neurohormonal system that has a significant impact on disease progression. As a result, the neurohormonal system has provided a key target for pharmacologic therapy in patients with heart failure secondary to systolic dysfunction. These targets include the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well as the sympathetic nervous system. Neurohormonal manipulation, however, is often ineffective in the pharmacologic therapy of patients with endstage heart failure, therefore other treatment strategies - including the use of inotropic agents to improve pump function and diuretics to control fluid balance are needed.",

There was a significant improvement in functional class during the mean follow-up period: 55% of the patients were in class III, 37% in class II, 5% in class I and 3% in class IV (p<0.0001). The proportion of patients on beta-blockers or spironolactone increased from 33% and 51% at the time of referral to 69% and 71% respectively after referral (p<0.0001). In the 12 months before referral, 39% of the patients had been hospitalized for acute decompensation of HF (87 hospitalizations - mean 7.2/month) versus 13% of the patients during the mean follow-up period (25 hospitalizations - 3.8/month, p<0.0001). No significant differences were found in the proportion of patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, digoxin or diuretics, or in the mean duration of hospitalization before and after referral.",

Detecting patients with heart failure could be simple but rather complex of clinical decisions as presentation could be classical or non-specific with minimal symptoms and orsigns. Management is aimed at relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, preventing hospitalisation and arresting disease progression thus prolonging survival. In addition to pharmacologic measures, non-pharmacologic ones are also employed.",

Strangely, the rate of anaphylactic reactions to rt-PA is higher (1.9%) when they are used in the treatment of acute stroke than when they are given to treat acute myocardial infarction (0.02%). Patients who are taking ACE inhibitors seem to be at increased risk of such a potentially life-threatening event. We now report on two patients, in each of whom asymmetric angioneurotic edema was observed following successful thrombolysis with rt-PA. Both these patients were taking ACE inhibitors. It was possible to avoid intubation and ventilation in both cases.

The prevention of renal damage is a very important aim of antihypertensive therapy. This is particularly so taking into account the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the general population. Non-dihydropyridines such as verapamil have been shown to possess an antiproteinuric effect that could be particularly relevant.",

They also reduce proteinuria and are renoprotective in experimental models of kidney disease. Direct renin inhibitors, when used with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, offer incremental blood pressure reduction far greater than that observed when an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker are used together. This suggests that renin inhibitors possess a unique and distinct mechanism of action compared with the other two therapeutic classes.",

In patients with chronic kidney disease some unique factors further increase the risk of arterial stiffness, and include volume overload, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, anemia, and dysregulated mineral metabolism. Arterial stiffness is increased even in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease. Blood pressure reduction when accompanied by a reduction in arterial stiffness is associated with improved prognosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can preferentially improve arterial stiffness, which may be an additional mechanism of cardiovascular protection with these agents.",

In animal models of diabetic nephropathy, ruboxistaurin normalized glomerular hyperfiltration, decreased urinary albumin excretion, preserved renal function and reduced mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In humans with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy already treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, treatment with ruboxistaurin for 1 year reduced albuminuria and urinary transforming growth factor-beta, and maintained estimated glomerular filtration rate. Ruboxistaurin has so far been shown to be well tolerated at the doses tested.",

RAAS has been implicated in pathogenesis of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. Aliskiren is the first non-peptide orally active renin inhibitor approved by FDA. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors are associated with frequent side effects such as cough and angio-oedema. Recently, the role of ACE2 and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the formation of an important active metabolite/mediator of RAAS, ang 1-7, has initiated attempts towards development of ACE2 inhibitors and combined ACE/NEP inhibitors. Furukawa and colleagues developed a series of low molecular weight nonpeptide imidazole analogues that possess weak but selective, competitive AT1 receptor blocking property. Till date, many compounds have exhibited promising AT1 blocking activity which cause a more complete RAAS blockade than ACE inhibitors. Many have reached the market for alternative treatment of hypertension, heart failure and diabetic nephropathy in ACE inhibitor intolerant patients and still more are waiting in the queue. But, the hallmark of this area of drug research is marked by a progress in understanding molecular interaction of these blockers at the AT1 receptor and unraveling the enigmatic influence of AT2 receptors on growth/anti-growth, differentiation and the regeneration of neuronal tissue. Different modeling strategies are underway to develop tailor made molecules with the best of properties like Dual Action (Angiotensin And Endothelin) Receptor Antagonists (DARA), ACE/NEP inhibitors, triple inhibitors, AT2 agonists, AT1/TxA2 antagonists, balanced AT1/AT2 antagonists, and nonpeptide renin inhibitors. This abstract gives an overview of these various angiotensin receptor antagonists.", 
    "114": "The metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation of factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. There is widespread agreement that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in diabetes. Indeed, large clinical trials have demonstrated substantial benefit of the blockade of this system for cardiovascular end-organ protection. Thus the blockade of the RAS may be a promising strategy for the treatment of the patients with the metabolic syndrome. Although several types of angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockers (ARBs) are commercially available for the treatment of patients with hypertension, we have recently found that telmisartan (Micardis) could have the strongest binding affinity to AT(1) receptor. Further, telmisartan is reported to act as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). These observations suggest that, due to its unique PPAR-gamma-modulating activity, telmisartan may be one of the most promising sartans for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. In this paper, we reviewed the potential utility of telmisartan in insulin resistance and vascular complications in diabetes.", 
    "115": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly occurring arrhythmia in clinical practice, however, the mechanism of atrial fibrillation is not well explained. It has been considered that myocardial fibrosis plays a role in atrial fibrillation. Within the heart, this fibrosis is thought to be mediated by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a potent stimulator of collagen-producing cardiac fibroblasts. Recent studies indicate that atrial fibrillation is associated with elevated serum concentrations of TGF-beta 1 and C-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (a marker of collagen type I synthesis). TGF-beta 1 was not only associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation but may also predict patients at increased risk for future development of atrial fibrillation. Why TGF-beta 1 in atrial fibrillation is high is a puzzling problem. We hypothesized that TGF-beta 1 is a possible cause of atrial fibrillation by initiating fibrosis response. Atrial interstitial fibrosis has been seen in patients with CHF and in animal models of pacing-induced heart failure. It was demonstrated that TGF-beta 1 levels were increased in the atria after the development of congestive heart failure in dogs. In a similar study, mice with increased expression of TGF-beta 1 were prone to atrial fibrillation development as a result of raised levels of atrial fibrosis. If the hypothesis is confirmed, administration of TGF-beta 1 monoclonal antibodies may be used to eliminate the etiology. It will be a new target point to treat atrial fibrillation.", 
    "116": "Nitrates are potent venous dilators and anti-ischemic agents. They are widely used for the relief of chest pain and pulmonary congestion in patients with acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. Nitrates, however, do not reduce mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Combination of nitrates and hydralazine when given in addition to beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are of African-American origin. Side effects during nitrate therapy are common but are less well described in the literature compared with the reported side effects in patients with stable angina pectoris. The reported incidence of side effects varies highly among different studies and among various disease states. Headache is the most commonly reported side effect with an incidence of 12% in acute heart failure, 41-73% in chronic heart failure, 3-19% in unstable angina and 2-26% in acute myocardial infarction. The reported incidence of hypotension also differs: 5-10% in acute heart failure, 20% in chronic heart failure, 9% in unstable angina and < 1-48% in acute myocardial infarction, with the incidence being much higher with concomitant nitrate therapy plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Reported incidence of dizziness is as low as 1% in patients with acute myocardial infarction to as high as 29% in patients with heart failure. Severe headaches and/or symptomatic hypotension may necessitate discontinuation of nitrate therapy. Severe life threatening hypotension or even death may occur when nitrates are used in patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction associated with right ventricular dysfunction or infarction, or with concomitant use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or N-acetylcysteine. Despite the disturbing observational reports in the literature that continuous and prolonged use of nitrates may lead to increased mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with stable coronary artery disease, no such adverse effects of nitrates have been reported in the large randomized trials in patients with acute myocardial infarction or chronic heart failure.", 
    "117": "The abnormal deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain appears crucial to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have suggested that highly amyloidogenic Abeta(1-42) is a cause of neuronal damage leading to AD pathogenesis and that monomeric Abeta(1-40) has less neurotoxicity than Abeta(1-42). We found that mouse and human brain homogenates exhibit an enzyme activity converting Abeta(1-42) to Abeta(1-40) and that the major part of this converting activity is mediated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Purified human ACE converts Abeta(1-42) to Abeta(1-40) as well as decreases Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio and degrades Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40). Importantly, the treatment of Tg2576 mice with an ACE inhibitor, captopril, promotes predominant Abeta(1-42) deposition in the brain, suggesting that ACE regulates Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio in vivo by converting secreted Abeta(1-42) to Abeta(1-40) and degrading Abetas. The upregulation of ACE activity can be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.", 
    "118": "Renin is the first and rate-limiting step cleaving angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, thus influencing angiotensin II (Ang II) formation. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is effective in management of several cardiovascular diseases; however, control continues to be difficult and requires multiple drug therapy. Use of RAS inhibitors does not totally prevent Ang II formation, which could continue to contribute to development of end-organ damage. Over the past two decades, renin inhibition seemed to be an attractive approach for complete blockade of the RAS. Recently, aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, was approved as the first of a new class of antihypertension drugs. Clinical trials demonstrated significant blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients with aliskiren used alone or combined with hydrochlorothiazide, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs. Studies are in progress to evaluate the potential role for renin inhibition in management of kidney and cardiac diseases.", 
    "119": "Pharmacological treatment of hypertension represents a cost-effective way for preventing cardiovascular and renal complications. To benefit maximally from antihypertensive treatment blood pressure (BP) should be brought to below 140/90 mmHg in every hypertensive patient, and even lower (< 130/80 mmHg) if diabetes or renal disease co-exists. Most of the time such targets cannot be reached using monotherapies. This is especially true in patients who exhibit a high cardiovascular risk. The co-administration of two agents acting by different mechanisms considerably increases BP control. Such preparations are not only efficacious, but also well tolerated, and some fixed low-dose combinations have a tolerability profile similar to placebo. This is for instance the case for the preparation containing the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 mg) and the diuretic indapamide (0.625 mg), a fixed low-dose combination that has recently been shown in controlled interventional trials to be more effective than monotherapies in reducing albuminuria, regressing cardiac hypertrophy and improving macrovascular stiffness. Fixed-dose combinations are becoming more and more popular and are even proposed by current hypertension guidelines as a first-line option to treat hypertensive patients.", 
    "120": "Resistance to antihypertensive drugs is common in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. This is unfortunate because hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for development of cardiovascular events, and the goal blood pressure level is set lower in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects. Previous outcome trials in diabetic subjects have mainly focused on end points such as microalbuminuria or the incidence of cardiovascular events rather than on reduction of blood pressure; some reports, however, have suggested mechanisms for the drug resistance. These include several clinical conditions known to be associated with difficulty in reducing blood pressure specifically in diabetes mellitus: change in the renin-angiotensin system and chymase, volume overload, central sympathetic hyperactivity, sleep apnea, secondary hypertension, pseudoresistance (white coat hypertension), and poor compliance related to subclinical depression. In this review, the authors focus on the mechanisms of resistance to antihypertensive therapy (particularly for monotherapy with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists) in the treatment of diabetic hypertension.",

Significant improvement of LV diastolic function and LA expansion index preceded the reduction of LA volume after blood pressure control. In patients with paroxysmal AF, LA volume reduction was more evident in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers.",

    "133": "Blood pressure fall occurring after acute ganglionic or L-VDCC blockade was enhanced in SHR. Ganglionic blockade eliminated strain differences in BP response to acute L-VDCC blockade and vice versa, suggesting that enhanced contribution of L-VDCC is responsible for augmented sympathetic vasoconstriction in SHR. Both phasic (dependent on internal calcium stores) and tonic (dependent on calcium influx) contractions to NE were augmented in SHR femoral arteries in vitro. Nifedipine attenuated only tonic contractions but to a larger extent in SHR than in WKY arteries. Nifedipine effect was greater after endothelium removal, which augmented tonic but not phasic contractions after NE. Chronic captopril treatment of SHR prevented hypertension development by suppression of their sympathetic vasoconstriction including its nifedipine-sensitive component, but failed to influence enhanced NE-induced arterial contractions or increased relaxation to nifedipine in vitro.",

    "135": "The cardiometabolic syndrome consists of several major components: hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Central to this syndrome are insulin resistance and generation of reactive oxygen species; these features are particularly prominent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this context, large clinical trials have shown that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is protective against type 2 diabetes. In spite of these solid clinical data, the mechanistic pathways by which RAS blockade achieves these protective effects have yet to be resolved. A recently identified local pancreatic islet RAS has, however, been implicated in this regard. Furthermore, RAS blockade was recently shown to enhance islet blood flow, oxygen tension, and insulin biosynthesis, thus improving beta-cell function and glucose tolerance. Meanwhile, RAS activation may also influence islet cell inflammatory responses, apoptosis, fibrosis, and superoxide anion production. This RAS-associated oxidative stress can induce islet cell dysfunction in the pancreas and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues.", 
    "136": "Heart disease and stroke are the most life-threatening consequences of diabetes mellitus, with mortality rates up to two to four times higher for persons with diabetes vs. those without and accounting for up to 65% of deaths. The cardiometabolic syndrome is a potent indicator of future risk of type 2 diabetes and concomitant increased potential for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pharmacologic treatment is usually necessary to improve blood pressure and lipids, thereby decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The reduction of cardiovascular and renal risk with type 2 diabetes and elevated blood pressure are compelling indications for thiazide diuretics, blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Nevertheless, most patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated blood pressure will require two or more agents to lower blood pressure to the recommended goal of <130/80 mm Hg, and combination therapy may be beneficial. In patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome without type 2 diabetes, the present goal is to maintain BP <140/90 mm Hg, although recent data suggest potential decrease in the progression of prehypertension to hypertension with antihypertensive medication. Furthermore, blockers of the renin-angiotensin system may actually prevent newonset diabetes. It is reasonable for patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease to achieve an optional low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal <70 mg/dL, and statin therapy should be considered regardless of baseline LDL-C level. In patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome without type 2 diabetes and calculated moderately high-risk status (two or more risk factors; 10-year risk, 10%-20%), the present goal for LDL-C is <130 mg/dL, with perhaps a therapeutic option of <100 mg/dL, and in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome at lower risk, the LDL-C goal remains <160 mg/dL. Multifactorial management must be utilized to prevent progression of cardiovascular risk with the cardiometabolic syndrome and the ravages of cardiovascular disease in persons with type 2 diabetes, including antiplatelet therapy with aspirin.",

Directly recorded radial and derived aortic pressure pulse waveforms were examined individually and were ensemble-averaged, and the difference between radial and aortic pressure responses was examined.", 
    "143": "The late systolic shoulder response from radial waveforms was reduced by 15.8 mm Hg (SD, 12.2 mm Hg) more with ramipril than with atenolol. This was similar to a difference of 14.6 mm Hg (SD, 11.2 mm Hg) calculated for the aortic systolic pressure response using the transfer-function technique. Ramipril caused a greater reduction in the aortic systolic pressure response (22.2 mm Hg), whereas with atenolol, there was a modest decrease (7.6 mm Hg). The mean difference between aortic systolic pressures measured from direct radial waveforms and from derived aortic pressure between 3 and 5 h after dosing under all circumstances was 1.6 mm Hg (SD, 8.9 mm Hg).", 
    "144": "Central pressure derived from radial pressure waveforms using a generalized transfer function gave similar results for central pressure measured directly from radial waveforms. The hemodynamic benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, and calcium channel blocker over beta-blocker antihypertensive therapy in recent trials were confirmed by this study.",

    "147": "Ramipril lowered age-adjusted daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure 6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 3 mm Hg less in African Americans compared with Caucasians (both P=.02). This difference persisted after adjusting for baseline blood pressure, body mass index, urine sodium and potassium, plasma aldosterone, and other covariates. Despite the difference in mean response, there was a 72% overlap in daytime blood-pressure response to ramipril between African Americans and Caucasians. Among Caucasians, ramipril lowered systolic blood pressure 2 mm Hg less during nighttime compared with daytime, whereas among African Americans, blood pressure lowering was equivalent during day and night. Nighttime blood-pressure response to ramipril did not differ significantly between African Americans and Caucasians.", 
    "148": "Ramipril was more effective in lowering daytime blood pressure in Caucasians compared with African Americans, but appreciable differences in response did not persist at night. Despite the small difference in mean response between groups, the majority of African Americans and Caucasians had a similar blood-pressure response to a fixed dose of ramipril.", 
    "149": "Hypertension often coexists with hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in metabolic syndrome. Allylmercaptocaptopril is a conjugate of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril with allicin, an active principle in garlic with multiple beneficial actions on metabolic-syndrome abnormalities. We sought to test the hypothesis that the conjugation of allicin to captopril may confer additional therapeutic actions in metabolic disease.",

    "151": "Allylmercaptocaptopril prevented progressive weight gain, without a detectable effect on food intake. Both captopril and allylmercaptocaptopril lowered blood pressure, but allylmercaptocaptopril was more effective. Allylmercaptocaptopril, but not captopril, improved cardiac hypertrophy, as indicated by heart weight and ventricular-wall thickness. Allylmercaptocaptopril improved, whereas captopril impaired, oral glucose tolerance after a fast. Triglycerides were decreased by both captopril and allylmercaptocaptopril. Total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol were reduced by captopril but not by allylmercaptocaptopril. The SHROB rats developed severe glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. Allylmercaptocaptopril showed significant nephro-protection, as indicated by reductions in urinary protein loss, urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, and plasma creatinine. Captopril showed the same trends and also prevented the decline of creatinine clearance. Finally, both allylmercaptocaptopril and captopril reduced the basal level of lipolysis in isolated abdominal adipocytes, and restored the response to catecholamine stimulation.", 
    "152": "Both captopril and allylmercaptocaptopril are effective in attenuating multiple abnormalities of metabolic syndrome.

CEA remains the most common vascular surgical operation performed today, however, its future has been called into question with the introduction of percutaneous carotid angioplasty and stenting, more effective antiplatelet agents (i.e., clopidogrel), cholesterol-lowering agents (i.e., statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The focus of this article is to review the notable trials substantiating the efficacy of CEA, indications for surgery and technical components that have refined expected favorable outcomes.", 
    "154": "In chronic heart failure there is gradual reactivation of vascular tissue angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII) conversion over time in patients taking chronic ACE inhibitor therapy. However, it remains unknown whether the same overall phenomenon occurs in other patients taking chronic ACE inhibitor therapy, such as patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "155": "We studied 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 43.5 +/- 10.8 years), all of whom received lisinopril (20 mg/day) as part of their normal treatment. Over the course of the 18 month study, we made measurements at 0, 9 and 18 months. These measurements included plasma values for components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In addition, we infused AI and AII into the brachial arteries of patients to assess vascular tissue AI to AII conversion.", 
    "156": "There were no significant changes in plasma renin activity, ACE, AI, AII or aldosterone during the study. In contrast, vascular AI to AII conversion was significantly (p = 0.01) greater at 18 months than at 0 months. There was no change over time in the response to infused AII.", 
    "157": "We have shown in vivo that vascular tissue AI to AII conversion gradually increases over time in patients with type 2 diabetes being treated with lisinopril. Further studies are required to determine whether this reactivation detracts from the cardioprotective effects of chronic ACE inhibitor therapy in diabetic patients, and if so, how best to overcome it.", 
    "158": "The mounting epidemic of overweight and obesity has made understanding the relationship between excess weight and associated comorbidities more urgent. Obesity is one of the strongest predictors of the development of hypertension and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and diabetes mellitus. The concomitant presence of obesity and hypertension, as commonly occurs in the cardiometabolic syndrome, magnifies the risk for cardiovascular and renal disease. The term \"obesity-hypertension\" thus serves to underscore the link between these two deleterious conditions and to emphasize the imperative for clinical intervention. Adipose tissue is now known to produce hormones and cytokines that promote inflammation, lipid accumulation, and insulin resistance. In addition, adipose tissue contains all the components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is upregulated in the presence of obesity. Evidence implicates activation of the systemic and adipose tissue RAS, as well as the sympathetic nervous system, as key obesity-related mechanisms of hypertension and other components of the cardiometabolic syndrome. RAS blockade therefore becomes a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with obesity-related hypertension and in persons with the cardiometabolic syndrome. Clinical trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers conducted in predominantly overweight/obese populations have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular and renal disease risk among a range of at-risk patients. RAS blockade also is associated with a reduced risk of new-onset diabetes compared with other classes of antihypertensive therapy. Randomized, controlled trials conducted specifically in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed to determine the optimal therapeutic approach for these patients.", 
    "159": "The regulation of blood glucose levels involves a finely tuned relationship between insulin sensitivity, hepatic glucose output, and production of insulin. The cardiometabolic syndrome includes in its definition criteria a disturbance of normal glucose tolerance and implies development of both insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. There is now abundant evidence pointing toward a central role of dysregulation of the beta-cell function and mass in the development of impaired glucose tolerance. Mechanisms implicated in beta-cell dysfunction include genetic abnormalities, prenatal and early postnatal insults, and environmental events along with obesity, dyslipidemia-lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity, oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, amyloid deposition, and activation of the local renin-angiotensin system. Novel therapeutic characteristics of known medications such as metformin, thiazolidinediones, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and novel medications such as exendin-4 promise encouraging possibilities to battle against the cardiometabolic syndrome and the future development of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "160": "Since exercise capacity is related to the mitochondrial respiration rate in skeletal muscle and both parameters are potentially modulated by the onset of diabetes and by inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), we investigated whether skeletal muscle oxidative functions and exercise capacities are impaired in chronic streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ) rats and whether ACE inhibition could reverse such abnormalities. The ACE inhibitor perindopril (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) was given for a period of 5 weeks to 7-month-old STZ rats (DIA-PE, n = 8) whose haemodynamic function, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and exercise capacity were compared with those of untreated diabetic (DIA, n = 8) and control rats (CONT, n = 8). Increased arterial blood pressure (157 +/- 12 versus 130 +/- 6 mmHg, P < 0.05) and reduced exercise capacity (29 +/- 2 versus 91 +/- 2 min, respectively, P < 0.01) were observed in DIA compared with CONT. The oxidative capacity of the gastrocnemius muscle was significantly reduced in DIA compared with CONT rats (5.4 +/- 0.5 versus 10.6 +/- 0.7 micromol O(2) min(-1)(g dry weight)(-1), respectively, P < 0.001). Moreover, the coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation was significantly impaired in DIA (-52%, P < 0.001). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) normalized blood pressure without improving mitochondrial function (4.3 +/- 0.8 micromol O(2) min(-1) (g dry weight)(-1) in DIA-PE rats) but reduced exercise capacity to even lower levels (10 +/- 1 min, P < 0.01). Exercise capacity correlated positively with blood pressure in DIA-PE (r = 0.79, P < 0.05). In experimental type 1 diabetic rats, both skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and exercise capacity are impaired. The ACEi failed to restore the muscular function and worsened exercise capacity. Further studies will be useful to determine whether an inadequate muscular blood flow secondary to the reduction in mean systemic blood pressure can explain these results.",

    "162": "The study population comprised 225 inpatients with HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less who were discharged alive. Five years later, survival and causes of death were determined. Proportionally, more Malay and Indian patients were admitted compared with Chinese patients (P < .001). There were 55.6% in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV. Ischemic heart disease was the most common cause (85.8%). At 5 years, 152 patients (67.5%) had died. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were prescribed to 79.1% of patients on discharge. Cardiovascular causes accounted for 69.7% of deaths. Predictors of mortality include female gender (P = .046), age 70 years or more (P = .017), renal impairment (P = .008), NYHA class III or IV (P = .03), and non-use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P = .005). On multivariate analysis, increasing age (P = .001) and renal impairment (P = .019) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. Cardiovascular death was more likely with NYHA class III or IV (P = .004) and renal impairment (P = .012).",

    "164": "On weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, a 59-year-old Japanese woman with mitral valve plasty suddenly showed a greatly increased heart rate, and an electrocardiogram revealed elevated ST-segments. There was also abnormal wall motion in the inferior region and apical ballooning of the left ventricle. We diagnosed the condition as takotsubo cardiomyopathy (acute left ventricle apical ballooning syndrome), possibly caused by catecholamine release and regional stress-induced ischemia. We believe this to be the first case report of takotsubo cardiomyopathy observed during heart surgery. We hypothesize that the condition was mediated by regional myocardial stunning and that it could be prevented by administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors before surgery and by the use of superior biocompatible cardiopulmonary bypass components. Once takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs, we recommend mechanical circulatory assistance during weaning from the bypass.", 
    "165": "There is increasing evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in the development of diabetic complications. Oxidative stress is increased in diabetes and in chronic kidney disease (CKD). High glucose upregulates transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and angiotensin II (Ang II) in renal cells and high glucose, TGF-beta1, and Ang II all generate and signal through ROS. ROS mediate high glucose-induced activation of protein kinase C and nuclear factor-kappaB in renal cells. Intensive glycemic control and inhibition of Ang II delay the onset and progression of diabetic nephropathy, in part, through antioxidant activity. Conventional and catalytic antioxidants were shown to prevent or delay the onset of diabetic nephropathy. Transketolase activators and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors were shown to block major biochemical pathways of hyperglycemic damage. Combination of strategies to prevent overproduction of ROS, to increase the removal of preformed ROS, and to block ROS-induced activation of biochemical pathways leading to cellular damage may prove to the effective in preventing the development and progression of CKD in diabetes.", 
    "166": "The biochemical process of advanced glycation appears to play a central role in the development and progression of diabetic vascular complications. A number of strategies to influence this pathway have been designed, one of which involves the putative advanced glycation end-product (AGE) crosslink breaker, alagebrium which has been shown in in vitro studies to cleave preformed AGE crosslinks. This agent has been studied in various models of diabetic complications and has been shown to attenuate diabetic renal disease, cardiac dysfunction, and atherosclerosis. In addition to the ability of alagebrium to reduce tissue levels of AGEs, this drug appears to inhibit activation of certain protein kinase C isoforms. Planned clinical studies in diabetic subjects at risk of complications should assist in determining the role of alagebrium in the prevention, retardation, and reversal of diabetic micro- and macrovascular disease.", 
    "167": "Numerous reports on the molecular mechanism of atherogenesis indicate an increase in oxidative stress, formation of advanced glycoxidation end products (AGEs), chronic inflammation, and activated cellular response particularly in diabetic patients. To elucidate the initiating and early accelerating events this review will focus on the molecular causes of the induction of these stress factors, their interactions, and their contribution to atherogenesis. Metabolic factors such as elevated free fatty acids, high glucose levels or AGEs induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vascular cells leading to ongoing AGE formation and to gene induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Vice versa, numerous cytokines found elevated in obesity and diabetes may also induce oxidative stress thus a circulus vitious may be initiated and accelerated. Increased production of ROS, mainly from mitochondria and NAD(P)H oxidase, stimulates signaling cascades including protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway leading to nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein 1, and specificity protein 1. Subsequently, the expression of numerous genes including cytokines is rapidly induced, which, in turn, may act on vascular cells promoting the deleterious effects. From animal models of accelerated atherosclerosis a causal role of NAD(P)H oxidase and the AGE/RAGE/NF-kappaB axis to atherogenesis is suggested. Because all factors involved form a highly interwoven network of interactions, the blockade of ROS or AGE formation at different sites may interrupt the vicious cycle. Promising candidate agents are, currently on trial. Most important to clinical practice, a number of drugs commonly used in the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT(1) receptor blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and thiazolidindiones have shown promising 'preventive' intracellular antioxidant activity in addition to their primary pharmacological actions.", 
    "168": "The effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on adrenal glucocorticoid secretion are controversial, and we have investigated this issue in guinea pigs, where, like in humans and cows, the main glucocorticoid hormone is cortisol. In vivo experiments showed that prolonged NPY administration markedly lowered cortisol plasma concentration not only in normal guinea pigs, but also in animals whose hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system had been pharmacologically interrupted by the simultaneous administration of dexamethasone and captopril. In vitro experiments ruled out the possibility that in vivo glucocorticoid anti-secretagogue action of NPY can ensue from a direct effect on the adrenal gland. In fact, NPY did not affect cortisol secretion from dispersed guinea pig inner adrenocortical cells. In contrast, NPY raised cortisol production from adrenal slices containing medullary tissue, and this effect was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol. This finding, coupled with the demonstration that NPY enhanced catecholamine release from guinea pigadrenomedullary tissue, strongly suggests that NPY may stimulate glucocorticoid secretion in this species through an indirect mechanism involving catecholamines, that in a paracrine manner promote the secretion of inner adrenocortical cells. In light of these observations, the conclusion is drawn that the in vivo effects of NPY are mediated by mechanism(s) independent of either the suppression of the main adrenal agonists ACTH and angiotensin-II or the direct inhibition of adrenal secretion. The possibility merits an investigation into whether NPY enhances the production of peptides, which, like leptin, inhibit adrenal glucocorticoid secretion acting as circulating hormones.", 
    "169": "Microalbuminuria independently predicts increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients, especially in those with concomitant diabetes or established cardiovascular disease. Drugs that target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduce microalbuminuria regardless of diabetic status. The Irbesartan in the Management of PROteinuric patients at high risk for Vascular Events was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled paralleled group study in which hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and increased cardiovascular risk were randomized to 20 weeks treatment with ramipril plus irbesartan or to ramipril plus placebo. Patients discontinued or tapered previous antihypertensive therapy during a 14-day placebo lead-in period. Change in albumin excretion rate from baseline to week 20 was the primary end point. Adjusted week 20 baseline geometric ratios for ramipril plus irbesartan and ramipril plus placebo were not significantly different. Although differences in blood pressure reductions were observed between the two treatments, these changes did not affect microalbuminuria. More patients on dual therapy achieved target blood pressure goals at week 20 than with monotherapy. The incidence of adverse effects and treatment-related adverse effects was similar in both groups. Our results suggest that patients with cardiovascular risk and relatively low albumin excretion rates in early-stage disease may only require monotherapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blocking agents.", 
    "170": "The prevalence of hypertension in blacks in the United States is among the highest in the world. Compared with whites, blacks develop hypertension at an earlier age, their average blood pressures are much higher and they experience worse disease severity. Consequently, blacks have a 1.3 times greater rate of nonfatal stroke, 1.8 times greater rate of fatal stroke, 1.5 times greater rate of heart disease death, 4.2 times greater rate of end-stage kidney disease, and a 50% higher frequency of heart failure; overall, mortality due to hypertension and its consequences is 4 to 5 times more likely in African Americans than in whites. The increased prevalence of hypertension and excessive target organ damage is due to a combination of genetic and, most likely, environmental factors. There are no clinical trial data at present to suggest that lower-than-usual BP targets should be set for high-risk demographic groups such as African Americans. The primary means of prevention and early treatment of hypertension in African Americans will be the appropriate use of lifestyle modification. The International Society of Hypertension in Blacks guidelines realize that most patients will require combination therapy, many of them first-line, to reach appropriate BP goals. Although certain classes and combinations of antihypertensive agents have been well-established to be effective, the choice of drugs for combination therapy in African American patients may be different. Within the African American group, the responsiveness to monotherapy with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers may be less than the responsiveness to diuretics and calcium channel blockers, but these differences are corrected when diuretics are added to the neurohormonal antagonists. Of note, African American patients with systolic BP >15 mm Hg or a diastolic BP >10 mm Hg above goal should be treated with first-line combination therapy.", 
    "171": "Metabolic syndrome (MetSyndr), a constellation of abnormalities [obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia (low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides (TG)], and elevated blood pressure (BP)], increases the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and premature death. From 10% to 30% of the adult population in industrialized countries has MetSyndr, which effectively predicts the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and CV disease. Because of the complex etiology of MetSyndr, a multi-targeted, integrated therapeutic approach is required to simultaneously treat high BP, obesity, lipid disorders and T2D (if present), to fully protect CV, cerebrovascular and renal systems. If lifestyle modification (weight control, diet, exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake) is ineffective, pharmaco-theraphy should be added to treat simultaneously the lipid- and non-lipid CV risk factors. Patients with HTN and MetSyndr should be started on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, unless contraindicated. The ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the odds of developing new onset T2D and also decrease albuminuria. The ACE inhibitors provide cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits beyond their effect on BP; they also improve IR. The ARBs are renoprotective in addition to being cardioprotective. Long-acting calcium channel blockers are also recommended in hypertensive patients with MetSyndr; these drugs also improve IR. Thiazides (at low doses) and selected ss-blockers can be given to patients with HTN and MetSyndr. Celiprolol in combination with diuretics has a favorable effect on glucose tolerance and IR in patients with HTN and MetSyndr, and spironolactone added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy provides additional reno- and CV protective benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Carvedilol, a ss-blocker with vasodilating properties, added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, is effective in preventing worsening of microalbuminuria in patients with HTN and MetSyndr; it also improves IR and glycemic control. Most patients eventually require two or more antihypertensive drugs to reach BP goal. It is recommended that therapy in patients whose BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above target at diagnosis be initiated with a combination of antihypertensive drugs, administered either as individual drugs or as fixed-dose formulations. Treatment with fixed-dose combinations, such as irbesartan + hydrochlorothiazide provides good BP control in more than two-thirds of hypertensive patients with MetSyndr. Lipid and BP targets are reached in a high percent of patients with HTN and CV disease treated with a combination of amlodipine + atorvastatin. In conclusion, hypertensive patients with the MetSyndr be treated aggressively for each component of the syndrome to provide CV, cerebrovascular and renal protection.", 
    "172": "NADPH oxidases have recently been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. The development of specific inhibitors of these enzymes has focused attention on their potential therapeutic use in hypertensive disease. Two of the most specific inhibitors, gp91ds-tat and apocynin, have been shown to decrease blood pressure in animal models of hypertension. Other inhibitors, including diphenylene iodonium, aminoethyl benzenesulfono fluoride, S17834, PR39, protein kinase C inhibitors, and VAS2870, have shown promise in vitro, but their in vivo specificity, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness in hypertension remains to be determined. Of importance, the currently available antihypertensive agents angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers also effectively inhibit NADPH oxidase activation. Similarly, the cholesterol-lowering agents, statins, have been shown to attenuate NADPH oxidase activation. Although, antioxidants act to scavenge the reactive oxygen species produced by these enzymes, their effectiveness is limited. Targeting NADPH homologues may have a distinct advantage over current therapies because it would specifically prevent the pathophysiological formation of reactive oxygen species that contributes to hypertension.", 
    "173": "Renal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form (NADPH) oxidase is an important source of oxidative stress and its expression is enhanced in the glomerulus and distal tubules of diabetic nephropathy. High glucose-induced protein kinase C signalling or renal angiotensin II signalling increases the membrane translocation of cytosolic component p47phox. NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the podocytes damage the glomerular basement membrane and the slit diaphragm causing proteinuria, and mesangial and glomerular endothelial NADPH oxidase increase TGF-beta and cause collagen and fibronectin accumulation. Tubular NADPH oxidase stimulated by angiotensin II or aldosterone contributes to sodium retention and to tubulointerstitial damage. Thus, inhibition of the renal renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker or selective aldosterone inhibitor indirectly suppresses NADPH oxidase reducing renal ROS, proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Statins are also effective in blocking the membrane translocation of Rac, especially in diabetes with hypercholesterolemia where ROS is produced by the intrinsic NADPH oxidase and by the activated macrophages. A medical herb, picrorhiza, inhibits the membrane translocation of p47phox, is a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase and, more so than superoxide dismutase mimetics, may be a promising strategy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "174": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for macrovascular disease complications. Hyperglycemia and atherosclerotic disease clearlyare associated, andbiologic intermediates mediated by hyperglycemia exist. Our understanding of the pathobiology linking hyperglycemia and atherosclerotic disease continues to evolve. Modulation of the advanced glycation end product (AGE) receptor for AGE (RAGE)/soluble RAGE (sRAGE) system, the thromboxane receptor, and C-peptide comprise just a few of the plausible links between dysglycemia and atherosclerosis. It seems intuitive, therefore, that therapeutic management of blood glucose in patients with diabetes should reduce macrovascular disease and related deaths. However, studies of glucose-lowering therapies performed to date yield qualitatively and quantitatively different results. No definitive proof of the concept is yet available, although it remains probable, with investigations presently under way. Numerous interventions extending beyond glucose control, including lifestyle modification, pharmacologic therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as aggressive blood pressure control independent of blood pressure levels, have proved to be of cardiovascular benefit in the high-risk population of patients with diabetes. Thus, all of these interventions should be used in addition to glucose management in all patients with diabetes who are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "175": "Accumulating evidence shows that deterioration of vascular endothelial function underlies the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases following lifestyle-related diseases. Both Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), which are tripeptides derived from proteolytic hydrolysate of milk casein, inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), suggesting that both VPP and IPP may improve vascular endothelial function, because many ACE inhibitors are known to improve endothelial function. We investigated the effects of ACE-inhibitory food component in humans with mild hypertension, since there has been no report on such effects. The study was conducted by the placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover method in 25 male subjects with mild hypertension. After casein hydrolysate containing both VPP and IPP were administered for 1 week, reactive hyperemia of the left upper forearm was measured using plethysmography as an index of vascular endothelial function. Since one subject dropped out, we analyzed the data of 24 subjects. The reactive hyperemia of the left upper forearm was produced by a 5 min occlusion using inflation of a cuff. The maximum blood flow during reactive hyperemia was 20.8+/-6.7 mL/min/100 mL tissue in the placebo group, whereas it increased remarkably to 30.0+/-10.4 mL/min/100 mL tissue in the group administered casein hydrolysate containing both VPP and IPP (p<0.001). There was no change in systemic blood pressure, indicating that the improvement of the vascular endothelial function attributable to VPP and IPP is independent of hemodynamic changes. We conclude that casein hydrolysate containing VPP and IPP improves the vascular endothelial dysfunction in subjects with mild hypertension. The continuous intake of VPP and IPP could help to prevent cardiovascular diseases in hypertensive subjects.", 
    "176": "Hyperglycaemia is a causative factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, known to induce chemokines in the kidney. Macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha (MIP-3 alpha) is a CC chemokine that has been reported to attract memory T lymphocytes. Our previous microarray study showed significant increased level of MIP-3 alpha in high glucose-induced transcriptional profile in renal proximal tubule cells. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a key regulator in inflammation and fibrosis in diabetes mellitus setting.", 
    "177": "This study aimed to determine the role of TGF beta 1 in high glucose-induced MIP-3 alpha expression. An in vitro model of human proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells) and an in vivo model of the transgenic (mRen-2)27 diabetic rat, well characterized as a model of human diabetic nephropathy, were used. Small interfering RNA technology was used to silence TGF-beta1 gene in HK-2 cells and subsequent experiments were performed to measure mRNA and protein levels of MIP-3 alpha using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the protein level of MIP-3 alpha and CD3 a marker of T lymphocytes in the in vivo model.", 
    "178": "MIP-3 alpha mRNA and protein expression was increased in HK-2 cells by high glucose and TGF-beta1. MIP-3 alpha was up-regulated in the dilated tubules of diabetic rats compared with non-diabetic control animals and CD3 was found to be present around the dilated tubules expressing MIP-3 alpha. This up-regulation was attenuated in the presence of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. MIP-3 alpha expression significantly decreased in cells in which the TGF-beta1 gene was silenced using small interfering RNA. Furthermore, exposure to high glucose did not induce MIP-3 alpha expression in TGF-beta1 gene silenced cells compared with wild-type cells.", 
    "179": "In summary, we have uniquely demonstrated that high glucose increases MIP-3 alpha through a TGF beta 1 dependent pathway, suggesting the centrality of TGF-beta1 in both the inflammatory and previously demonstrated fibrotic responses in diabetic nephropathy.",

Our study population consisted of patients admitted to a tertiary care Veterans Administration hospital with suspicion of ACS between November 2001 and January 2006. All patients had an electrocardiogram on admission that was compared with a previous electrocardiogram to confirm new-onset AF or atrial flutter. Of 1,526 patients, 164 (10.8%) had new-onset AF and 601 (39.4%) were on a statin on admission. Patients with AF were significantly more likely to be older, Caucasian, have renal insufficiency and anemia, and less likely to be diabetic, on a statin or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on admission, or have chest pain as a presenting complaint. In univariate analysis, patients on statins were significantly less likely to have new-onset AF (odds ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.69, p <0.01). This relation persisted in the multivariate model (odds ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.83, p <0.01) after correcting for age, race, diabetes mellitus, chest pain, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

    "190": "Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Raynaud's phenomenon generally precedes other disease manifestations. The distribution of skin lesions and the internal organ involvement are the basis for the classification into limited and diffuse forms of the disease. Clinically evident renal disease is observed in 10-40% of patients. The most common renal presentation is renal crisis, characterized by acute onset of renal failure and severe hypertension; some patients remain normotensive, showing microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Renal complications due to penicillamine may occur in some patients. Finally, ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis is a rare complication of the disorder. In spite of treatment with ACE inhibitors, 20-50% of patients with renal crisis progress to end-stage renal disease. In the absence of a specific therapy, there is accumulating evidence supporting the effectiveness of prostacyclin derivatives, antifibrotic and immunosuppressive drugs. The evidence is strong that the ACE inhibitors that are used in renal crisis are disease modifying. In our series including 193 patients with systemic sclerosis, renal involvement was observed in 19 patients; 11 presented renal crisis (hypertensive in 8; normotensive in 3); 5 had chronic nephropathy; 2 developed penicillamine-induced nephrotic syndrome, and 1 ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. Renal disease occurs in a minority of patients with systemic sclerosis, and may have a variable clinicopathological picture. As renal involvement is associated with a worse prognosis, careful monitoring of blood pressure, urine chemistry and renal function is required, particularly in patients with diffuse skin disease.", 
    "191": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were screened from a random peptide-displayed phage library using ACE-coupled liposomes. Among four kinds of inhibitory peptides selected by biopanning with two different elution strategies, a peptide (LSTLRSFCA) showed the highest inhibitory activity with an IC(50) value of 3microM. By measuring inhibitory activities of fragments of the peptide, it was found that the RSFCA region was a functional site to inhibit strongly the ACE catalytic activity, and particularly both Arg and Cys residues were essential for the strong inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity of RRFCA was slightly increased, while that of the RSFRA, in which the Cys residue was replaced by Arg, was decreased to greater extent in comparison with the inhibitory activity of RSFCA. Taking into account the results obtained from the SPOT analysis, it was suggested that the Arg and Phe residues in RSFCA were important for a specific interaction with ACE, and the Cys residue inhibited the ACE activity. The cystein-based ACE-inhibitory peptides have not been isolated from processed food materials. These findings suggested that the biopanning method utilizing protein-coupled liposomes and random peptide libraries might have a possibility to screen new functional peptides that are not found in processed food materials.",

    "205": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study, important in drug design, mainly involves two aspects, molecular structural characterization (MSC) and construction of a statistical model. MSC focuses on transforming molecular structural and property characteristics into a group of numerical codes, dedicated to minimizing information loss during this process. In this context, common atoms in organic compounds are classified according to their families in the periodic table, and hybridization states, and on the basis of these, three nonbonding interactions (i.e. electrostatic, van der Waals and hydrophobic) are calculated, ultimately resulting in a new rotation-translation invariant, 3D-MSC, as a three-dimensional holograph vector of atomic interaction field (3D-HoVAIF). By applying 3D-HoVAIF to QSAR studies on two classical peptides including 58 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 48 bitter-tasting dipeptides, we get two excellent genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS) models, with statistics r(2), q(2), root mean square error (RMSEE), and root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSCV) of 0.857, 0.811, 0.376, and 0.432 for ACE inhibitors and 0.940, 0.892, 0.153 and 0.205 for bitter-tasting dipeptides, respectively. By equally dividing the two datasets into training and test sets by D-optimal, the 3D-HoVAIF approach undergoes rigorous statistical validation. Furthermore, the superior performance of 3D-HoVAIF is confirmed in comparison with two other peptide MSC approaches referring to z-scale and ISA-ECI. For 58 ACE inhibitors, the GA-PLS model yields two principal components, with the following statistics: r(2) = 0.893, q(2) = 0.824, RMSEE = 0.349, RMSCV = 0.425, q2(ext) = 0.739, r2(ext)= 0.784, r2(0.ext) = 0.781, rf2(0.ext) = 0.77, k = 0.962, k' = 1.019, and RMSEP = 0.460; for 48 bitter-tasting dipeptides, three principal components resulted, with the statistics as: r(2) = 0.950, q(2) = 0.893, RMSEE = 0.152, RMSCV = 0.222, q2(ext)= 0.875, r2(ext) = 0.919, r2(0.ext)= 0.919, rf2(0.ext)= 0.919, k = 1.018, k' = 0.974, and RMSEP = 0.198. In addition, the relationship of ACE-inhibiting activities with bitter-tasting thresholds has been investigated by applying the above-constructed models to predictions on 400 theoretically possible dipeptides. Through analysis, the ACE-inhibiting activities are found to be prominently related to bitter-tasting intensities. Thus, it is deemed to be difficult to find such dipeptides that simultaneously satisfy pharmacodynamic action (high ACE-inhibiting activities) and comfortable tastes, suggesting that active components of dipeptides that are served as functional food to lower blood pressure are not very ideal.", 
    "206": "Endothelial dysfunction is universal in diabetes, being intimately involved with the development of cardiovascular disease. The pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes is complex. It is initially related to the effects of fatty acids and insulin resistance on 'uncoupling' of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and mitochondrial function. Oxidative stress activates protein kinase C (PKC), polyol, hexosamine and nuclear factor kappa B pathways, thereby aggravating endothelial dysfunction. Improvements in endothelial function in the peripheral circulation in diabetes have been demonstrated with monotherapies, including statins, fibrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, metformin and fish oils. These observations are supported by large clinical end point trials. Other studies show benefits with certain antioxidants, L-arginine, folate, PKC-inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma agonists and phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitors. However, the benefits of these agents remain to be shown in clinical end point trials. Combination treatments, for example, statins plus ACE inhibitors and statins plus fibrates, have also been demonstrated to have additive benefits on endothelial function in diabetes, but there are no clinical outcome data to date. Measurement of endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular research can provide fresh opportunities for exploring the mechanism of benefit of new therapeutic regimens and for planning and designing large clinical trials.",

One-third of all patients were not receiving any cardioprotective drugs; among those patients who were, 42% were on one drug, 21% were on two, 3.7% were on three, and 1.5% were on four. The most prescribed agent was ACE-I (35.8%), followed by aspirin (30.6%), and beta-blockers (28.0%). The use of statins was remarkably and significantly low (4.1%) (p < 0.001), even in the higher risk subgroups (patients with diabetes or macrovascular disease). ACE-I plus aspirin was the most prescribed combination (8.5%). Cardioprotective agents recommended for risk-factor modification by the ACC/AHA Guidelines for their well-established efficacy in the general population were underutilized in this cohort of high-risk hypertensive hemodialysis patients, despite an elevated prevalence of clinically evident CVD. Speculatively, this fact may be relevant to better understand the known increased cardiovascular morbidity-mortality associated with chronic renal disease.",

The use of enalaprilat inhibited the changes in urine output, blood pressure, serum concentration of urea, p0(2), and tissue activity of MPO and MDA in the pancreas and lungs.

We examined the effects of angiotensin inhibition either with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or with angiotensin receptor blocker on patient prognosis and heart-ankle pulse wave velocity (haPWV) in CKDs. Randomized controlled study was performed on 102 patients with non-diabetic CKDs. Patients were divided into two groups with or without angiotensin inhibition, and followed until death, creatinine clearance was halved or starting renal replacement therapy, whichever occurred first. For 4 years, haPWV was assessed repeatedly in the surviving patients. While both groups showed well blood pressure control throughout 4 years (129+/-1 to 131+/-2/71+/-1 to 73+/-2 mm Hg), renal prognosis was better in angiotensin inhibition group (P<0.05). In addition, angiotensin inhibition reduced cardiovascular and renal death (P<0.05). Age, sex, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and proteinuria were correlated to haPWV (R(2)=0.76, P<0.0001). Although haPWV was similar between two groups at the start of the study (1098+/-31 vs 1094+/-37 cm/s), it was higher in patients without angiotensin inhibition than that with angiotensin inhibition 4 years later (1034+/-38 cm/s (n=28) vs 1242+/-37 cm/s (n=23), P<0.01). The present results provided the evidence that angiotensin inhibition arrested a time-dependent elevation of haPWV in non-diabetic CKDs, conferring organ protection. Furthermore, our data indicated that angiotensin inhibition improved patient prognosis in non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases with mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction.", 
    "214": "We hypothesized that beneficial role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) therapy may involve (among others) their anti-inflammatory effects, which may be reflected by serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. For that reason, we have investigated the influence of short-term administration of quinapril on serum IL-6 concentration. 124 patients suffering from stable CAD and matched for some of CAD risk factors were enrolled in our study. Patients were randomized to treatment with quinapril or control (placebo administration). Blood samples were taken twice: before and after four weeks of quinapril administration. The effect of quinapril administration was assessed under double-blind placebo-controlled conditions. We observed that quinapril reduced serum IL-6 concentration in almost all studied subgroups of patients (p < 0.001). Interestingly, such an effect was not observed in smokers. Additionally, we found that baseline IL-6 levels were higher in: smokers as compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.001), patients with total cholesterol (TC) to high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio (TC/HDL-ch ratio) above 5 as compared with subjects with TC/HDL-ch < or = 5 (p = 0.001), and in patients who did not report any statin therapy in comparison with patients undergoing statin treatment (p = 0.023). In conclusion, quinapril may interfere with cytokine release by lowering IL-6 levels, which may be of particular importance for secondary prevention of stable CAD.", 
    "215": "To determine the effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) and blood pressure (BP) lowering on renal sodium transporter abundance and distribution in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 9-wk SHR were treated with enalapril (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 4 wk. BP decreased from 156 +/- 4 to 96 +/- 8 mmHg. Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and Na(+)-P(i) cotransporter type 2 (NaPi2) localized to the body of the microvilli (MV) in normotensive rat strains. In untreated SHR, NHE3 partially retracted from the body to base of the MV and NaPi2 retracted to subapical vesicles. After enalapril treatment of SHR, NHE3 fully retracted to the base of the MV and, by density gradient fractionation, NHE3, NaPi2, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, myosin VI, Na-Cl cotransporter, and cortical Na-K-Cl cotransporter redistributed from low-density (apical enriched) to high-density (endosome enriched) membranes. Enalapril decreased total abundance of myosin VI (to 0.51 +/- 0.18 of untreated), ACE (0.67 +/- 0.22), and cortical NaPi2 (0.83 +/- 0.10). Normalizing SHR BP with HRH (7.5 mg/day hydralazine, 0.15 mg/day reserpine, and 3 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide) did not change Na(+) transporter density distribution or abundance. We conclude that lowering BP to normal levels in SHR does not normalize Na(+) transporter distribution, rather, chronic ACEI treatment provokes retraction of Na(+) transporters and associated proteins from transport-relevant domains of apical membranes and/or reduces their abundance.", 
    "216": "Sepsis-related acute kidney injury (AKI) is the leading cause of AKI in intensive care units. Endotoxin is a primary initiator of inflammatory and hemodynamic consequences of sepsis and is associated with experimental AKI. The present study was undertaken to further examine the role of the endothelium, specifically prostacyclin (PGI(2)), in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia-related AKI. A low dose of endotoxin (LPS, 1 mg/kg) in wild-type (WT) mice was associated with stable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (164.0 +/- 16.7 vs. 173.3 +/- 6.7 microl/min, P = not significant) as urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), the major metabolite of PGI(2), increased. When cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin abolished this rise in 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), the same low dose of LPS significantly decreased GFR (110.7 +/- 12.1 vs. 173.3 +/- 6.7 microl/min, P < 0.05). The same dose of indomethacin did not alter GFR in WT mice. To further study the role of PGI(2) in endotoxemia, renal-specific PGI synthase (PGIs) transgenic (Tg) mice were developed that had increased PGIs expression only in the kidney and increased urinary 6-keto-PGF(1alpha). These Tg mice, however, demonstrated endotoxemia-related AKI with low-dose LPS (1 mg/kg) (GFR: 12.6 +/- 3.9 vs. 196.5 +/- 21.0 microl/min P < 0.01), which did not alter GFR in WT mice (164.0 +/- 16.7 vs. 173.3 +/- 6.7 microl/min, P = not significant). An elevation in renal cAMP, however, suggested an activation of the PGI(2)-cAMP-renin system in these Tg mice. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition afforded protection against endotoxin-related AKI in these Tg mice. Thus endothelial PGIs-mediated PGI(2), as previously shown with endothelial nitric oxide synthase-mediated nitric oxide, contributes to renal protection against endotoxemia-related AKI. This effect may be overridden by excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renal-specific PGIs Tg mice.", 
    "217": "Ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is largely dependent on renin-angiotensin system activity, which is determined by angiotensin II concentration and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) density in target tissues.

Moreover LVESVI positively and LVEF negatively correlated with AT(1)R density although the strength of these correlations was weaker than at discharge. Infarct size as reflected by a single troponin T measurement and post-MI therapy did not differ between high- and low-AT(1)R groups: over 85% patients received ACE-inhibitor, beta-blocker and statin.",

Up to now, there has been no controlled data to guide the optimal medical regimen, but it is reasonable to treat these patients with standard medications for left ventricular systolic dysfunction during acute phase. This includes aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and diuretics as necessary for volume overload. Since this type of cardiomyopathy is a transient disorder, the appropriate duration of therapy is not known. Although the current study demonstrates that the use of beta-blockers, aspirin, ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers does not seem to be indicated for chronic treatment of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, we strongly believe that we need to achieve the data which will be obtained from large scale prospective studies in the near future to assess the clinical significance of chronic medical treatment.", 
    "222": "Levels of obesity-linked non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypertension are highest among indigenous communities in North America. This is linked to changes in dietary pattern towards high calorie foods such as sugar, refined grain flour, and sweetened beverages. Therefore, a return to traditional dietary patterns may help to reduce these disease problems because of better balance of calories and beneficial nutrients. Further protective non-nutrient phenolic phytochemicals against NIDDM and hypertension are potentially high in these foods but less understood. In this study antidiabetic- and antihypertension-relevant potentials of phenolic phytochemicals were confirmed in select important traditional plant foods of indigenous communities such as pumpkin, beans, and maize using in vitro enzyme assays for -glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities. In vitro inhibitory activities of these enzymes provide a strong biochemical rationale for further in vivo studies and dietary management strategy for NIDDM through the control of glucose absorption and reduction of associated hypertension. These enzyme inhibitory activities were further compared to total soluble phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the above-targeted plant foods. Pumpkin showed the best overall potential. Among the varieties of pumpkin extracts P5 (round orange) and P6 (spotted orange green) had high content of total phenolics and moderate antioxidant activity coupled to moderate to high alpha-glucosidase and ACE inhibitory activities. Therefore this phenolic antioxidant-enriched dietary strategy using specific traditional plant food combinations can generate a whole food profile that has the potential to reduce hyperglycemia-induced pathogenesis and also associated complications linked to cellular oxidation stress and hypertension.",

Prevalence of diastolic dysfunction has been found to be higher than systolic dysfunction in most studies. Many physiological conditions (age, sex and body weight), and pathological processes, such as cardiac or systemic diseases, can increase the incidence of diastolic dysfunction. Early diagnosis of left ventricular diastolic impairment has been demonstrated to have important therapeutic implications. Several invasive or non-invasive methods to investigate diastolic properties of the left ventricle have been described; a large number of studies compared different parameters of diastolic function in order to find the most accurate: this is of particular prognostic relevance since diastolic dysfunction may remain asymptomatic for a long period before resulting in overt heart failure. The purpose of this article is to provide an extensive review of the contemporary literature regarding diastolic function assessment and its role in daily practice.",

In this article we report the case of a 28-yr-old woman with CS secondary to adrenal adenoma who exhibited congestive heart failure as an initial symptom. Two weeks before being admitted to our hospital, the patient started complaining of shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and generalized edema. A physical examination did not reveal signs of hypercortisolism. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral diffused crepitation; blood pressure was 180/120 mmHg with heart rate of 90 beats/min. A chest X-ray showed a cardiac shade enlargement due to congestive heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a dilated left ventricle and an impaired left ventricular systolic function. The patient's urinary cortisol excretion was elevated and circadian rhythm of cortisol was absent. ACTH level was low. In addition, plasma cortisol failed to decrease after administration of dexamethasone. An abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a 7-cm right adrenal mass. The patient was administered oxygen, spironolactone, ACE-inhibitor and the signs and symptoms of heart failure gradually improved. A laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed and pathological examination of the gland showed a benign adrenocortical adenoma. After the adrenalectomy the patient was started on hydrocortisone therapy and 5 months later the wall thickness of the left ventricle was within normal range and the patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg. In conclusion we report the case of heart failure as the main clinical symptom in CS secondary to adrenal adenoma.",

Left ventricular eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS, and copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD or SOD-1) were determined by immunoblotting. MVO(2) of left ventricular tissue samples was measured in vitro in response to increasing doses of bradykinin, enalapril maleate, and amlodipine. We examined the changes in passive diameter and flow-dependant arteriolar dilation of coronary arterioles. Echocardiography indicated increases in cardiac output ( approximately 60%) during pregnancy. Myocardial eNOS (21 +/- 4%), phosphorylated eNOS (19 +/- 3%), and SOD-1 (61 +/- 2.7%) protein levels were significantly increased at 60D. Bradykinin, enalapril maleate, and amlodipine (10(-4) mol/l) decreased MVO(2) in a nitric oxide-dependant manner (by 24 +/- 1.3% in controls and 34 +/- 2.2% at 60D; by 21 +/- 1.1% in controls and 29 +/- 1.1 at 60D; and by 22 +/- 2.5% in controls and 26 +/- 1.0% at 60D, respectively). Arterioles from pregnant dogs showed increased flow-dependant dilation in response to increased shear stress and larger passive diameter. Nitrite production was stimulated by bradykinin and carbachol in microvessels in vitro; pregnancy enhanced nitrite release. Myocardial eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS, and SOD-1 protein expression are increased during pregnancy, and this increase is associated with enhanced nitric oxide-dependant control of MVO(2). Thus increases in eNOS and SOD-1 promote the coupling of oxygen delivery and efficiency in the heart during pregnancy.",

We subjected anesthetized mice to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion and evaluated infarct size immediately after reperfusion. Losartan (Los) or EXP3174 [2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yI)methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid] were administered 5 min before starting reperfusion at dosages determined by preliminary studies of blood pressure effect and inhibition of angiotensin pressor response. Compared with saline, both drugs significantly reduced myocardial infarct size by roughly 40% (P < 0.001). Pretreatment of mice with the selective AT2 receptor antagonist PD123,319 [S-(+)-1-([4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl)-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo(4,5-c)pyridine-6-carboxylic acid] did not affect infarct size in the absence of losartan but abolished the reduction in infarct size provided by losartan. In tissue kallikrein gene-deficient mice (TK-/-), losartan no longer reduced infarct size. Pretreatment of wild-type mice with the B2 receptor antagonist icatibant reproduced the effect of TK deficiency. We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade provides cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through stimulation of AT2 receptors. Kallikrein and B2 receptor are major determinants of this cardioprotective effect of losartan. Our results support the hypothesis of a coupling between AT2 receptors and kallikrein during AT1 receptor blockade, which plays a major role in cardioprotection.",

Such hyporesponsiveness contributes significantly to morbidity, mortality and health-care economic burden in chronic kidney disease and represents an important diagnostic and management challenge. The commonest causes of ESA resistance are non-compliance, absolute or functional iron deficiency and inflammation. It is widely accepted that maintaining adequate iron stores, ideally by administering iron parenterally, is the most important strategy for reducing the requirements for, and enhancing the efficacy of ESA. There have been recent epidemiologic studies linking parenteral iron therapy to an increased risk of infection and atherosclerosis, although other investigations have refuted this. Inflammatory ESA hyporesponsiveness has been reported to be improved by a number of interventions, including the use of biocompatible membranes, ultrapure dialysate, transplant nephrectomy, ascorbic acid therapy, vitamin E supplementation, statins and oxpentifylline administration. Other variably well-established causes of ESA hyporesponsiveness include inadequate dialysis, hyperparathyroidism, nutrient deficiencies (vitamin B12, folate, vitamin C, carnitine), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aluminium overload, antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia, primary bone marrow disorders, myelosuppressive agents, haemoglobinopathies, haemolysis and hypersplenism.

A total of 144 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes (64 of transversal study and 80 of randomized clinical trial) were compared with 92 controls belonging to a transversal study. Secondarily, in a separate analysis, therapeutic effects of calcium antagonist amlodipine and ACE inhibitor enalapril were compared in a longitudinal, randomized trial in the patients. We assessed whole-blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, partial and total disaggregation times, haematocrit and fibrinogen. Radial artery systolic flow velocity was measured by pulsed Doppler. Shear stress was calculated as the product of flow velocity x whole-blood viscosity. Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher whole-blood viscosity for all shear rates (P < 0.001) as well as higher arterial diameter and systolic blood flow velocity (2.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.3 mm, P < 0.001; and 50.8 +/- 11.6 vs. 45.6 +/- 9.8 cm/s, P = 0.01, respectively). Whole-blood viscosity at shear rate gamma = 128/s tended to increase with amlodipine (+1.13%) and decrease with enalapril (-2.47%) (P = 0.028 for inter-group difference). In hypertensive diabetic patients, hyperviscosity contributes to increased shear stress. Haemorheological disturbances in these patients are not significantly influenced by blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive therapy by ACE inhibitor enalapril or calcium antagonist amlodipine.

    "271": "Atrial fibrillation is a common and in most patients recurrent arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation can increase mortality and causes at times severe symptoms in affected patients. Timely initiation of sustained oral anticoagulation is indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke to prevent thromboembolic complications. Patients at risk for stroke can be identified by clinical characteristics using validated score systems, e.g., the CHADS(2) score or the Framingham score. Drugs that slow AV nodal conduction can improve symptoms associated with high ventricular rate. Cardioversion can acutely terminate atrial fibrillation in almost all patients, but many patients suffer from recurrent atrial fibrillation. The prevention of arrhythmia recurrences (\"rhythm control therapy\") is indicated in patients with severe arrhythmia-related symptoms. Antiarrhythmic drugs can approximately double the maintenance rate of sinus rhythm. Other drugs that were not primarily developed as antiarrhythmic agents, e.g., ACE inhibitors, sartans, and possibly statins, can further improve maintenance of sinus rhythm in selected patient groups. Catheter-based isolation of the pulmonary veins is a recently developed intervention that can cure some forms of atrial fibrillation. It is likely that a multimodal therapeutic approach will in the future allow rhythm control therapy to become more effective.",

By C-statistic calculations, BNP and NT-proBNP significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the best available model for incident heart failure, and NT-proBNP also improved the model for cardiovascular death.

However, the long-term effects of discontinuation of digoxin therapy on mortality and morbidity in HF have not been well studied. Of the 7,788 participants in the Digoxin Investigation Group trial, 3,365 received digoxin before randomization. During the trial, digoxin was continued in 1,666 patients and discontinued in 1,699 patients. Using multivariable Cox regression analyses, we first determined the effect of discontinuation of digoxin on mortality and hospitalization during 39.7 months of median follow-up. Of the 1,666 patients continued on digoxin, 457 had low (0.5 to 0.9 ng/ml) and 340 had high (>or=1.0 ng/ml) serum digoxin concentrations (SDC) after 1 month of therapy and of the 1,699 patients whose digoxin was discontinued, 1,674 were alive at 1 month. We examined the effects of continuation of digoxin at low or high SDC. Compared with continuation of long-term digoxin therapy, discontinuation of digoxin was associated with a significant increase in all-cause hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 1.28, p <0.0001) and HF hospitalization (AHR 1.35, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.51, p <0.0001), but had no effect on all-cause mortality (AHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.19, p = 0.272). In contrast, continuation of digoxin at low SDC was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality (AHR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90, p = 0.002), all-cause hospitalization (AHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91, p = 0.001), and hospitalization for HF (AHR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.73, p <0.0001). In conclusion, continuation of long-term digoxin therapy at low SDC was associated with reduction in mortality and hospitalization in ambulatory patients with chronic HF receiving background therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics.", 
    "278": "Our aim was to determine the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality associated with the presence of significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), and to explore the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics in this population during a 3-year follow-up period. We identified 97 patients with significant renal dysfunction (RD, defined as a calculated glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min) and 38 patients without RD, with ejection fractions of <40%. A stenosis of >50% using magnetic resonance angiography of the renal arteries was used to define significant RAS. Seventy-three (54%) patients had significant RAS of >or=1 artery. Mean follow-up time was 37.3 (+/- 7.9) months. Compared with patients with no significant RAS, these patients were on higher doses of diuretics, lower doses of ACE inhibitors, had prolonged hospital admissions, were admitted with exacerbation of HF, and had a higher mortality (p = 0.007 for mortality). In conclusion, RAS is common in patients with chronic HF, especially among patients with RD and is a predictor of a poor clinical outcome. Interventional trials on renal revascularization are underway that contain subsets of patients with HF that may provide evidence on how best to manage RAS in this setting.",

The PERSPECTIVE study, a substudy of the EUROPA trial, evaluated the effect of perindopril on coronary plaque progression as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In total 244 patients (mean age 57 years, 81% men) were included. Evaluable paired quantitative coronary angiograms were obtained from 96 patients randomized to perindopril and from 98 patients to placebo. Concomitant treatment at baseline consisted of aspirin (90%), lipid-lowering agents (70%), and beta blockers (60%). The primary and secondary end point was the difference of minimum and mean lumen diameters (quantitative coronary angiography) or mean plaque cross-sectional area (IVUS) measured at baseline and 3-year follow-up between the perindopril and placebo groups. After a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range 1.9 to 4.1), no differences in change in quantitative coronary angiographic or IVUS measurements were detected between the perindopril and placebo groups (minimum and mean luminal diameters -0.07 +/- 0.4 vs -0.02 +/- 0.4 mm, p = 0.34; mean luminal diameter -0.05 +/- 0.2 vs -0.05 +/- 0.3 mm, p = 0.89; mean plaque cross-sectional area -0.18 +/- 1.2 vs -0.02 +/- 1.2 mm(2), p = 0.48). In conclusion, we found no progression in coronary artery disease by quantitative coronary angiography and IVUS with long-term administration of perindopril or placebo, possibly because most patients were on concomitant treatment with a statin.", 
    "280": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, peptidyl dipeptidase, EC 3.4.15.2) is a key enzyme in cardiovascular pathophysiology. A wide spectrum of monoclonal antibodies to different epitopes on the N and C domains of human ACE has been used to study different aspects of ACE biology. In this study we characterized the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5F1, developed against the N domain of human ACE, which recognizes both the catalytically active and the denatured forms of ACE. The epitope for mAb 5F1 was defined using species cross-reactivity, synthetic peptide (PepScan technology) and phage display library screening, Western blotting, site-directed mutagenesis, and protein modeling. The epitope for mAb 5F1 shows no overlap with the epitopes of seven other mAbs to the N domain described previously and is localized on the other side of the N domain globule. The binding of mAb 5F1 to ACE is carbohydrate-dependent and increased significantly as a result of altered glycosylation after treatment with alpha-glucosidase-1 inhibitor, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), or neuraminidase. Out of 17 species tested, mAb 5F1 showed strict primate ACE specificity. In addition, mAb 5F1 recognized human ACE in Western blots and on paraffin-embedded sections. The sequential part of the epitope for mAb 5F1 is created by the N-terminal part of the N domain, between residues 1 and 141. A conformational region of the epitope was also identified, including the residues around the glycan attached to Asn117, which explains the sensitivity to changes in glycosylation state, and another stretch localized around the motif 454TPPSRYN460. Site-directed mutagensis and inhibition assays revealed that mAb 5F1 inhibits ACE activity at high concentrations due to binding of residues on both sides of the active site cleft, thus supporting a hinge-bending mechanism for substrate binding of ACE.", 
    "281": "Apoptosis of alveolar type II (ATII) cells in response to high-amplitude mechanical stretch represents an important mechanism of ventilation-induced lung injury. Previously, it was demonstrated in an in vitro model that stretch-induced ATII cell apoptosis was prevented by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This study investigates the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors prevent stretch-induced apoptosis and elucidates the role of bradykinin as an endogenous anti-apoptotic factor. Rat ATII cells cultured on flexible membranes were subjected to cyclic stretch (40 cycles/min; 30% increase in surface area) and compared with static controls. Angiotensinogen, the bradykinin precursor T-kininogen, and bradykinin receptor expression were measured by RT-PCR; Angiotensin II and phosphoinositol 3 OH-kinase (PI3K) activity (as phospho-Akt) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; and Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) were measured by Western blot. Stretch did not influence angiotensinogen expression or induce angiotensin II generation. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin did not prevent stretch-induced apoptosis, whereas ACE inhibitors did. Stretch reduced ATII cell bradykinin release (T-kininogen expression and bradykinin supernatant concentration), and subsequently led to reduced PI3K activity and decreased concentrations of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L). Bradykinin substitution or addition of keratinocyte or hepatocyte growth factor prevented stretch-induced decrease in PI3K activity and Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L) and reduced stretch-induced apoptosis. Mechanical stretch impairs a constitutively expressed, autocrine anti-apoptotic ATII cell survival signal involving bradykinin-mediated stimulation of the PI3K-Akt-Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L) pathway. Restoration of this pathway prevents stretch-induced apoptosis. This may be beneficial when mechanical ventilation cannot completely avoid alveolar overdistension to maintain oxygenation.", 
    "282": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most important cause of death in the industrialized world. After experimental myocardial infarction, numerous dilated vessels appear in the border zone between the infarct and noninfarct areas. Angiogenic therapy has been widely regarded as an attractive approach for both treating CAD and enhancing arterioprotective functions of the endothelium. In this report, we critically review the evidence supporting the regulation of angiogenesis and angiogenic factors by cardiovascular medications such as statins, cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker, etc. Furthermore, in patients with CAD, vascular growth (vasculogenesis), capillary network growth (angiogenesis) and collateral artery growth (arteriogenesis), may be important. Current evidence from clinical trials on these therapies suggests that the development of coronary collateral circulation is likely to be a viable therapeutic strategy for CAD, while adaptation to chronic coronary stenosis can proceed. Many studies have suggested that newly developed strategies which include the administration of angiogenic growth factors and the transplantation of bone marrow-derived angioblasts are beneficial for the ischemic heart. Our assessment of the evidence in this review leads us to conclude that the development of collateral circulation using conventional cardiovascular medications may also play a critical role and needs to be reconsidered in the treatment of patients with CAD.",

    "287": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), a circulating hormone that can be synthesized locally in the vasculature, has been implicated in diabetes-associated vascular complications. This study was conducted to determine whether high glucose (HG) (approximately 23.1 mmol/L), a diabetic-like condition, stimulates Ang II generation and the underlying mechanism of its production in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. The contribution of various enzymes involved in Ang II generation was investigated by silencing their expression with small interfering RNA in cells exposed to normal glucose (approximately 4.1 mmol/L) and HG. Angiotensin I (Ang I) was generated from angiotensinogen by cathepsin D in the presence of normal glucose or HG. Although HG did not affect the rate of angiotensinogen conversion, it decreased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), downregulated ACE-dependent Ang II generation, and upregulated rat vascular chymase-dependent Ang II generation. The ACE inhibitor captopril reduced Ang II levels in the media by 90% in the presence of normal glucose and 19% in HG, whereas rat vascular chymase silencing reduced Ang II production in cells exposed to HG but not normal glucose. The glucose transporter inhibitor cytochalasin B, the aldose reductase inhibitor alrestatin, and the advanced glycation end product formation inhibitor aminoguanidine attenuated HG-induced Ang II generation. HG caused a transient increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation, and ERK1/2 inhibitors reduced Ang II accumulation by HG. These data suggest that polyol pathway metabolites and AGE can stimulate rat vascular chymase activity via ERK1/2 activation and increase Ang II production. In addition, decreased Ang II degradation, which, in part, could be attributable to a decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression observed in HG, contributes to increased accumulation of Ang II in vascular smooth muscle cells by HG.",

Myocardial infarction was induced by left coronary artery ligation and a control group (SHAM) underwent sham-operation. Infarcted rats received normal drinking water with (CAP group) or without (INF group) captopril. Functional assessment was performed by electro (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) just before and 21 days after surgery. The ECG of INF and CAP showed similar values and resembled healed infarct after surgery. The most outstanding differences between INF and CAP were the prevention of the increase of P-wave and attenuation both in rightward deviation of the QRS axis and Q-wave amplitude in CAP compared with INF. The ECHO showed that captopril treatment improved the diastolic filling more than systolic performance. Cardiac dilatation and left congestive heart failure were observed only in INF. Both infarcted groups showed a scar tissue in the left ventricular wall, but the INF showed a higher scar area than CAP (49.7+/-5.24 vs. 22.33+/-6.19 respectively). These data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system induces morphologic and functional changes in post-infarcted rat hearts and which can be assessed by non-invasive exams.",

    "295": "Imbalances of zinc (Zn) metabolism in arterial hypertension are related to increased urinary Zn excretion, Zn transfer between extracellular and intracellular spaces, and redistribution of this element inside the cells. The changes include an increase of the absorption of Zn in the gastrointestinal tract and decreases of its concentration in lymphocytes, bone, and arterial walls. The Zn content of erythrocytes, cardiac muscle, and kidneys also increases. The condition eventually leads to Zn deficiency (1-5). Zinc plays many roles in biological systems. It is a component of over 300 enzymes, performing catalytic, cocatalytic, and/or structural functions. Among others, it conditions the activities of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and the angiotensin-I converting (ACE) and endothelin-converting (EC) enzymes. Zn is essential for forming the quaternary structure of numerous regulatory proteins and hormone receptors that conditions binding with DNA, such as zinc-fingers, zinc-twists, or zinc-clusters. It is a structural element of the nucleic acids and takes part in its metabolism. Zn stabilizes and regulates cell membrane functions. Cellular growth and division depends on the content of Zn inside the cell and on its transport inside the cell's compartments (6-11).",

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that subjects with genetically lower plasma and tissue ACE activity, because of their ACE [I/D (insertion/deletion)] genotype, would have a lower risk of T2DM in 2642 healthy middle-aged Caucasian men (mean age, 56 years) followed-up for 15 years. Obesity was the strongest predictor of T2DM, with an HR (95% CI) [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)] of 3.74 (2.66-5.26) (P<0.0001). Overall there was no association between ACE genotype (II homozygotes, n=623; and D allele carriers, n=2019) and risk of T2DM, and although in lean men there was no genotype difference in risk in D allele carriers compared with II homozygotes [adjusted HR=0.75 (95% CI, 0.46-1.22)], in obese (body mass index >30 kg/m(2)) men the risk of T2DM was higher [adjusted HR=4.26 (95% CI, 1.30-13.93)] with a genotype-obesity interaction of P=0.01. A similar pattern of risk was seen by re-analysis of a previously published case-control study, where D allele carriers had a non-significant 1.30 (0.97-1.74)-fold higher risk of developing T2DM than II homozygotes when non-obese, but a 1.79 (1.17-2.72) (P=0.007)-fold higher risk when obese. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. The ACE D allele may worsen glucose metabolism, which could raise the prospective T2DM risk in obese men, but not in lean men. In obesity, adipose tissue undergoes inflammatory infiltration and the subsequent higher levels of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II may explain this association.",

Essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their long-chain metabolites and other products prevent platelet aggregation, lower blood pressure, reduce LDL-C, and ameliorate the adverse actions of homocysteine. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites show all the actions expected of the \"polypill\". Unlike the proposed \"polypill\", EFAs are endogenous molecules, have no significant side effects, can be taken orally for long periods of time even by pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children; and have been shown to reduce the incidence cardiovascular diseases.

This is due to an increased number of cardiac mast cells resulting in high concentrations of cardiotoxic mast cell mediators in cardiac tissue during anaphylaxis. Severe anaphylaxis in coronary heart disease, in particular, is explained by an increased load of cardiac mast cells together with coronary stenosis favouring myocardial hypoxia.

Five important forms of nonallergic angioedema can be distinguished: hereditary (HAE), acquired (AAE), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blocker-induced (RAE), pseudoallergic angioedema (PAE) and idiopathic angioedema (IAE). Some angioedema are present in the larynx and may cause death. A vast majority of nonallergic angioedema are RAE, particularly those caused by ACE inhibitors. It appears important to emphasize that in patients with complete intolerance to RAAS-blockers, cessation of RAAS-blockers is likely to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Currently, there is no published algorithm for diagnosis and treatment. Angioedema is usually treated by a conservative clinical approach using artificial ventilation, glucocorticoids and antihistamines. Today, a plasma pool C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate is the therapy of choice in HAE. The current pharmacotherapy of nonallergic angioedema is not satisfactory, thus requiring the identification of effective agents in clinical trials. Recently, several new drugs were developed: a recombinant C1-INH, a kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide) and a specific bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist (icatibant). According to currently available reports, these drugs may improve the treatment of kinin-induced angioedema.",

Generosity of drug coverage was defined as the percentage of the beneficiary's annual drug expenditures paid by the employer. Dependent variables were any statin use for the group with coronary heart disease and hyperlipidemia and any angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use in the group with congestive heart failure. Logistic regression analyses estimated the adjusted odds of essential medication use by generosity category in each disease group. We estimated the extent to which medication use would change if generosity levels moved to those under standard Medicare Part D levels.",

In both disease groups, retirees in the less generous drug coverage categories had significantly lower adjusted odds of use than retirees with the most generous drug benefits (ie, covering > or = 76% of annual drug expenditures). Overall, the shift to a standard Medicare Part D structure would result in mean declines of 8.4% in statin use and 5.2% in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use.

Studies indicate that monotherapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs slows progression of diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. Vascular protective effects of RAS inhibition have also been demonstrated in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events in the absence of significant blood pressure elevation or left ventricular dysfunction. Combining the complementary effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs to achieve more complete RAS blockade is a promising approach to further reducing cardiovascular risk. This review will present the rationale for dual RAS inhibition, clinical data relating to its efficacy, and ongoing studies designed to evaluate its utility in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events.",

We evaluated the relationship between blood flow velocity and dilatation of the brachial artery following transient forearm ischemia and acetylcholine-induced relaxation in subcutaneous small arteries and the influence of antihypertensive therapy on both in patients with essential hypertension. Thirty-one previously untreated hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril or the beta-blocker atenolol and compared with 17 healthy normotensive controls. Before and after 1 year of treatment, while still on active medication, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was measured in the brachial artery using ultrasound while relaxation to acetylcholine in small arteries was tested in vitro in a myograph. FMD correlated inversely to resting brachial artery diameter (r = -0.38, p<0.05). FMD corrected for resting diameter (FMD(corr)) was lower in patients (3.0+/-0.2%) compared with controls (4.2+/-0.3%, p<0.01). In both patients and controls, FMD(corr) was related to flow velocity in a non-linear way with FMD(corr) reaching a maximum despite increasing flow velocities, and in the patients, FMD(corr) was only reduced at high flow velocities. Furthermore, patients had a reduced acetylcholine-induced relaxation in small arteries (p = 0.04). Perindopril and atenolol reduced blood pressure to similar levels and both drugs improved FMD(corr) to a similar degree without any effects on relaxation to acetylcholine in small arteries. The present study demonstrates the role of correcting for differences in baseline diameter during measurements of FMD and a non-linear relationship between flow velocity and FMD in the brachial artery. Furthermore, the results suggest different effects of antihypertensive treatment on endothelial function in large and small arteries.",

Thus, preservation of kidney function might simultaneously protect the heart and the brain and, conversely, addressing cardiovascular risk factors might safeguard the kidney. This review considers the evidence supporting this approach, focusing on the protective effect of blood-pressure lowering and the ancillary actions of antihypertensive agents on renal protection. We review recent evidence on renal protection in individuals with and without diabetes, and the importance of offering a high standard of care also to those with the metabolic syndrome or prediabetes in order to prevent initial forms of renal, and as a consequence, cardiovascular damage. Intervention may be appropriate even in individuals with high-normal blood pressure, if they already have early renal and/or cardiovascular risk markers. As a consequence of these insights, thresholds for starting antihypertensive therapy are gradually falling, whereas awareness of the need for an early intervention in patients at high risk of developing renal damage and simultaneously cardiovascular disease is growing.",

If patients remain in the functional class NYHA III-IV despite optimal medication and have cardiac dyssynchrony, biventricular pacing may improve the symptoms and prognosis. While evidence-based treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in systolic heart failure, hardly any results from clinical trials are available for diastolic heart failure.

In macroalbuminuric patients, an additional $4.10 and $4.58 saves one life and avoids one composite endpoint, respectively; however, in these patients, not giving an ACE inhibitor is dominant for prevention of CVD events and dialysis. This is due to a 28.62% higher mortality rate in patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor. Thus, analysis of the composite endpoint shows that not giving an ACE inhibitor does not remain dominant. A limitation of our study is the inability to determine causality.",

    "353": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been defined in different ways. However, key components common to most definitions are a constellation of risk factors including abdominal adiposity, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. A major mediator of MetS appears to be insulin resistance, which relates to the development of the vascular and metabolic dysfunctions that precede overt cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying the elevated cardiovascular risk associated with MetS begin with subclinical organ damage. Therapy for MetS targets individual components of the syndrome and includes lifestyle interventions, lipid-modifying therapy, and antihypertensive agents, particularly those that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Results of trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated reductions in new-onset diabetes and cardiovascular events in a wide range of patients. Clinical trials to investigate further the role of these drugs in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes in patients with MetS are currently under way. The purpose of this paper is to review the MetS from the perspective of the cardiology workforce with the hope that a better understanding of the links between MetS and cardiovascular disease could lead to improved management of persons at risk.",

In this posthoc International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study analysis, we determined whether adverse outcomes are related to consistency of BP control, defined as the proportion of visits in which BP was in control. A total of 22 576 patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease were divided into 4 groups according to the proportion of visits in which BP was in control (<140/90 mm Hg): <25%, 25% to <50%, 50% to <75%, and >or=75%. Risk of primary outcome (first occurrence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), myocardial infarction, and stroke decreased progressively from the group with <25% to the group with >or=75% of visits with BP control. Adjusted risks of primary outcome (heart rate: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.67), myocardial infarction (heart rate: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.70), and stroke (heart rate: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.67) were less in the group with >or=75% of visits with BP control compared with the group with <25% of visits with BP control. Baseline BP was not predictive of outcomes. Proportion of visits with BP control was associated with mean follow-up systolic BP (r(2)=0.64), both being independently related to primary outcome. As proportion of visits with BP control increases, there is an associated steep reduction in cardiovascular risk, independent of baseline characteristics and mean on-treatment BP. Consistency of BP control during treatment provides additional information on the protective effect of antihypertensive treatment. Physicians need to be concerned at each visit if BP is not controlled.", 
    "355": "Accelerated cardiovascular disease is a frequent complication of renal disease. Chronic kidney disease promotes hypertension and dyslipidemia, which in turn can contribute to the progression of renal failure. Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of renal failure in developed countries. Together, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes are major risk factors for the development of endothelial dysfunction and progression of atherosclerosis. Inflammatory mediators are often elevated and the renin-angiotensin system is frequently activated in chronic kidney disease, which likely contributes through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species to the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in chronic kidney disease. Promoters of calcification are increased and inhibitors of calcification are reduced, which favors metastatic vascular calcification, an important participant in vascular injury associated with end-stage renal disease. Accelerated atherosclerosis will then lead to increased prevalence of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Consequently, subjects with chronic renal failure are exposed to increased morbidity and mortality as a result of cardiovascular events. Prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease are major considerations in the management of individuals with chronic kidney disease.", 
    "356": "Effective treatment of high blood pressure levels represents a key strategy for reducing global cardiovascular risk. Other factors, beyond blood pressure control, however, appear to be of potential relevance in reducing the risk related to hypertension. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that those pharmacological agents that counteract the renin-angiotensin system may confer additional clinical benefits across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease, beyond their blood pressure-lowering properties. These studies are largely based on the use of an antihypertensive strategy, based on the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and low-dose thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers. Over the last few decades, clinical trials have also tested the potential effects of combination therapy based on the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs and other renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents, including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and, more recently, renin inhibitors. This review highlights the evidence derived from recent clinical trials, supporting a role for pharmacological strategies based on ARBs in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and renal disease.", 
    "357": "The plasma coagulation system reacts quickly to limit blood loss from injury sites but also contributes to vascular thrombosis. In current models of hemostatic balance, normal coagulation and thrombosis represent two sides of the same coin, however, recent data from gene-deleted murine models have challenged this dogma. Deficiency of coagulation Factor XII (Hageman factor), a serine protease that initiates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, severely impairs arterial thrombus formation but is not associated with excessive bleeding. These findings suggest that fibrin-generating mechanisms that operate during pathologic thrombus formation involve pathways distinct from those that are active during normal hemostasis. As Factor XII selectively contributes to thrombus formation in occlusive disease, but not to normal hemostasis, inhibition of this protease may offer a novel treatment strategy for prevention of arterial thrombosis with minimal or no risk of bleeding.", 
    "358": "Antiarrhythmic pharmaceutical development for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is moving in several directions. The efficacy of existing drugs, such as carvedilol, for rate control and, possibly, suppression of AF, is more appreciated. Efforts are being made to modify existing agents, such as amiodarone, in an attempt to ameliorate safety and adverse effect concerns. This has resulted in promising data from the deiodinated amiodarone analog, dronedarone, and further work with celivarone and ATI-2042. In an attempt to minimize ventricular proarrhythmia, atrial selective drugs, such as intravenous vernakalant, have demonstrated efficacy in terminating AF in addition to promising data in suppression recurrences when used orally. Several other atrial selective drugs are being developed by multiple manufacturers. Other novel therapeutic mechanisms, such as drugs that enhance GAP junction conduction, are being developed to achieve more effective drug therapy than is offered by existing compounds. Finally, nonantiarrhythmic drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, high-mobility group coenzyme A enzyme inhibitors and omega-3 fatty acids/fish oil, appear to have a role in suppressing AF in certain patient subtypes.

The somatic form of the enzyme (sACE) comprises two homologous metallopeptidase domains (N and C), each bearing a zinc active site with similar but distinct substrate and inhibitor specificities. On the basis of the recently determined crystal structures of both ACE domains, we have studied their complexes with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is cleaved releasing both the protected NH2- and COOH-terminal tripeptides. This is the first molecular modeling study of an ACE-peptide substrate complex that examines the structural basis of ACE's endopeptidase activity and offers novel insights into subsites that are distant from the obligatory binding site and were not identified in the crystal structures. Our data indicate that a bridging interaction between Arg500 of the N-domain and Arg8 of GnRH that involves a buried chloride ion may account for its role in the specificity of the N-domain for endoproteolytic cleavage of the substrate at the NH2-terminus in vitro. In support of this, the protected NH2-terminal dipeptide of GnRH exhibits stronger interactions than the protected COOH-terminal dipeptide with the N-domain of ACE. Further comparison of the models of ACE-substrate complexes promotes our understanding of how the two domains differ in their function and specificity and provides an extension of the pharmacophore model used for structure-based drug design up to the S7 subsite of the enzyme.",

When infused into wild-type mice for 4 weeks, ADMA elevated SBP and caused marked medial thickening and perivascular fibrosis in coronary microvessels, which were accompanied by ACE protein upregulation and cardiac oxidative stress. The treatment with amlodipine reduced SBP but failed to ameliorate the ADMA-induced histological changes. In contrast, these changes were abolished in transgenic mice, with a reduction in plasma ADMA. In coronary artery endothelial cells, ADMA activated p38 MAP kinase and the ADMA-induced ACE upregulation was suppressed by p38 MAP kinase inhibition by SB203580. In wild-type mice, long-term treatment with angiotensin II increased plasma ADMA and cardiac oxidative stress and caused similar vascular injury. In transgenic mice, these changes were attenuated. The present study suggests that DDAH2/ADMA regulates cardiac NO levels but has modest effect on SBP in normal conditions. Under the circumstances where plasma ADMA are elevated, including angiotensin II-activated conditions, ADMA serves to contribute to the development of vascular injury and increased cardiac oxidative stress, and the overexpression of DDAH2 attenuates these abnormalities. Collectively, the DDAH2/ADMA pathway can be a novel therapeutic target for vasculopathy in the ADMA or angiotensin II-induced pathophysiological conditions.",

Dialysis was not required in 36%, was required temporarily (for up to 3 years) in 23%, was required permanently in 41%. Patients not on dialysis showed improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate after SRC (mean change +23 ml/min over 3 years). Poor renal outcome was associated with lower blood pressure at presentation, and with higher age in those requiring dialysis. Steroid use, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, and antibody profile were not related to renal outcome. In the 58 renal biopsies available for clinical correlation, acute changes of mucoid intimal thickening in arteries and fibrinoid necrosis in arterioles were associated with a poorer renal outcome.

In this randomized controlled trial, patients were followed up for 5 years to determine their long-term renal outcome to ACEI/ATRA therapy and to ascertain if their ACE gene profile could play a role in determining their response to therapy. Seventy-five patients with IgAN were enlisted. Thirty-seven were on ACEI/ATRA therapy for 62+/-5 months and thirty-eight were untreated and served as controls. All patients had their ACE gene ID polymorphism genotyped. Compared to controls, treated patients had lower serum creatinine (p < 0.001), lower proteinuria (p < 0.002) and fewer numbers progressing to ESRF (p < 0.002). Among patients with genotype II, there were less ESRF in the treatment group when compared to the untreated control group (p < 0.02). The advantage of therapy was not seen in patients with ID or DD genotypes. ACEI/ATRA therapy was found to be effective in retarding disease progression in IgAN with years to ESRF significantly extended in patients at all levels of renal function, including patients whose outcome were ESRF. Genotyping showed better response to therapy only for those with genotype II. The common mechanism is probably through lower levels of ACE, glomerular pressure and proteinuria resulting in reduced renal damage and retardation of progression to ESRF.", 
    "382": "Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system remain a cornerstone of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been demonstrated to afford cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with atherosclerosis and preserved left ventricular function, at the present time it is unclear if angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) exert similar benefits. We performed a population-based comparative study to compare the rates of hospital admission for acute coronary syndromes between users of ARBs relative to the use of ACEIs. A retrospective cohort study using population-based administrative databases in Ontario, Canada covering over 1.4 million residents age 65 years and older with access to universal healthcare coverage was conducted. We compared the hospital admission for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) among patients initiated on ARBs as compared to propensity-score matched patients started on ACEIs from 1999 through 2002, using a 3:1 (ACEI:ARB) matching strategy. Each individual was observed for up to 2 years. The primary outcome of interest was an ACS event, defined as the composite of hospital admission for myocardial infarction and/or unstable angina. During over 71,000 person-years of follow-up, we observed 1,295 hospitalizations for ACS. Relative to ACEI users (n = 49,037), rate of hospitalizations for ACS was similar in patients initiated on ARBs (n = 16,456) (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.04. Pre-specified secondary analysis, performed in patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes, and heart failure, also revealed no difference in rates of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes in users of ARBs compared to ACEIs (adjusted relative risk, diabetes: 0.79, 95% CI 0.58-1.07; heart failure: 0.84, 95% CI 0.59-1.20; atherosclerosis: 0.85, 95% CI 0.70-1.04). These data represent the first and largest population based comparative evaluation of ACEI and ARBs on hospitalizations for ACS among new users of each therapy. Our findings suggest that ARBs offer similar reduction in acute coronary syndrome outcomes in elderly patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes or heart failure. These data have important clinical implications, especially since patients over the age of 65 represent the largest users of risk reduction therapy.", 
    "383": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) are severe medical conditions, increasing threats to human health and socio-economic burdens in industrialized countries. CKD is assessed by an estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). ESRD is an indication for renal replacement therapy by either dialysis or kidney-transplantation. Major risk factors for CKD are arterial hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. The multifactorial pathogenesis of CKD and ESRD offers various therapeutic interventions: treatment of the underlying disease, anti-hypertensive therapy, glycemic control and anti-diabetic therapy, anti-proteinuric therapy, renoprotection, and life style management. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) lower the systemic blood-pressure, reduce proteinuria and may slow or even halt the deterioration of renal function. Alert glycemic control is important to avoid or protract diabetic nephropathy. Restricted protein intake, cessation of cigarette smoking and chronic analgesic-abuse may also prevent the progression of chronic nephropathy.", 
    "384": "The level of proteinuria is one of the most important predictors for progressive renal function loss in kidney disease. Reduction of urinary protein levels by renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors limits renal function decline in patients with non-diabetic and diabetic nephropathies to the point that remission of the disease and regression of renal lesions have been reported. The increasing use of these drugs is possibly at the basis of the stabilization of rates of new cases of kidney failure reported to the US Renal Data System after a 2-decade period of progressive increases. RAS inhibition, however, may not be effective to the same degree in all patients. For those patients who do not reach a complete remission of proteinuria, treatment procedures to implement renoprotection should include strict blood pressure control (and metabolic control in diabetics), lowering of blood lipids, and lifestyle modifications. Early intervention may be important to maximize renoprotection, especially in diabetics.", 
    "385": "There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in chronic liver disease. A number of studies have shown that components of a local hepatic RAS are up-regulated in fibrotic livers of humans and in experimental animal models. Angiotensin II, the main physiological effector molecule of this system, mediates liver fibrosis by stimulating fibroblast proliferation (myofibroblast and hepatic stellate cells), infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the release of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as TGF (transforming growth factor)-beta1, IL (interleukin)-1beta, MCP (monocyte chemoattractant protein)-1 and connective tissue growth factor. Furthermore, blockade of the RAS by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists significantly attenuate liver fibrosis in experimental models of chronic liver injury. In 2000 ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), a human homologue of ACE, was identified. ACE2 efficiently degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7), a peptide which has recently been shown to have both vasodilatory and tissue protective effects. This suggests that ACE2 and its products may be part of an alternate enzymatic pathway in the RAS, which counterbalances the generation and actions of angiotensin II, the ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas axis. This review focuses on the potential roles of the RAS, angiotensin II and ACE2 in chronic liver injury and fibrogenesis.", 
    "386": "We assessed the effect of previous peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and stroke on clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and sought to ascertain the effectiveness of evidence-based therapies in these patients. We used data from the multinational Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Patients were enrolled at 102 hospitals in 13 countries between April 1999 and September 2005. Patients presenting with ACS were stratified according to the presence of previous PAD, stroke, PAD and stroke, or neither. In-hospital analysis included 48,418 patients and 6-month analysis included 32,735 patients. The primary end point was all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events during 6-month follow-up. Adverse in-hospital and 6-month events were lowest in patients with neither PAD nor stroke and highest in patients with PAD and stroke after adjustment for baseline demographics and co-morbidities. In-hospital mortality for the 4 groups (neither, PAD, stroke, PAD and stroke) was 4.5% versus 7.2% versus 8.9% versus 9.4% (p <0.001) and that for 6-month mortality was 3.9% versus 8.8% versus 9.3% versus 12%, and these differences persisted after accounting for differences in baseline characteristics. Use of evidence-based therapies was associated with significantly less morbidity and mortality in all ACS subgroups. In conclusion, outcomes after ACS are worse in patients with PAD or stroke, with the highest risk in patients with the 2 conditions and the use of evidence-based therapies are associated with improved outcomes in all ACS subgroups.",

Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that CRP and serum albumin significantly predicted the risk of cardiovascular events. Similarly, high CRP, low serum albumin and low hemoglobin levels predicted morbidity as measured by the number of hospitalizations. Hemoglobin and albumin levels were lower in patients with high CRP (> or = 10.5 mg/l, highest tertile) as compared with low CRP levels (< or = 8 mg/l, lowest tertile). Patients receiving treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor Type 1 antagonist (ARA-II) had significantly lower levels of CRP than those who were not under such treatment (n = 46, CRP = 8.7 (5.1-29.8) vs n = 44, CRP = 10.4 (6.1-37.2), p < 0.05) (Figure 1).",

    "391": "Patients with hypertension, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, are at heightened risk for cardiovascular and renal disease. Accumulated evidence indicates that the majority of hypertensive patients at high risk will require more than one antihypertensive agent to reach their blood pressure (BP) target. A reasonable strategy is to use agents with complementary mechanisms of action to enhance BP-lowering efficacy and prevent target organ damage. In experimental models, the combination of a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with an agent that blocks the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, improves measures of endothelial function, inflammation, ventricular remodelling and renal function to a greater degree than these classes given as monotherapy. In clinical trials, calcium channel/RAS blockade combination therapy has been shown to provide greater BP reductions and improve renal function in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease earlier and to a greater extent than monotherapy. In addition, dual calcium channel/RAS blockade increases arterial compliance, arterial distensibility and flow-mediated vasodilation. Expanding upon extensive research on the benefits of calcium channel blockade and RAS blockade for the prevention of vascular events and preclinical and clinical trial evidence suggests added effects of combination therapy by targeting the underlying mechanisms of hypertensive vascular disease.", 
    "392": "The stability properties of enalapril maleate (EM) and of different tablet formulations including EM were studied by isothermal microcalorimetry and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It was shown that water content of the sample and elevated temperature have a high impact on stability properties of the substance itself and of the formulations including this substance. The degradation is more extensive at higher water content and at elevated temperature. The type of the tablet formulation (5 or 20mg EM tablet formulation) also has an impact: the 5 EM tablet formulation is the less stable one. The heat output of individual tablet formulations was used to evaluate the enthalpy changes and to calculate the difference in the amount of degraded EM between various samples. These results agreed satisfactorily with those obtained by HPLC. Isothermal microcalorimetry proved to be a fast and predictive method that could be used in preformulation studies to accelerate the pharmaceutical development and shorten the time before launching the product to the market.", 
    "393": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a metallopeptidase that converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE is crucial in the control of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis and fertility in mammals. In vertebrates, both transmembrane and soluble ACE, containing one or two active sites, have been characterized. So far, only soluble, single domain ACEs from invertebrates have been cloned, and these have been implicated in reproduction in insects. Furthermore, an ACE-related carboxypeptidase was recently characterized in Leishmania, a unicellular eukaryote, suggesting the existence of ACE in more distant organisms. Interestingly, in silico databank analysis revealed that bacterial DNA sequences could encode putative ACE-like proteins, strikingly similar to vertebrates' enzymes. To gain more insight into the bacterial enzymes, we cloned the putative ACE from the phytopathogenic bacterium, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, named XcACE. The 2 kb open reading frame encodes a 672-amino-acid soluble protein containing a single active site. In vitro expression and biochemical characterization revealed that XcACE is a functional 72 kDa dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase. As in mammals, this metalloprotease hydrolyses angiotensin I into angiotensin II. XcACE is sensitive to ACE inhibitors and chloride ions concentration. Variations in the active site residues, highlighted by structural modelling, can account for the different substrate selectivity and inhibition profile compared to human ACE. XcACE characterization demonstrates that ACE is an ancestral enzyme, provoking questions about its appearance and structure/activity specialisation during the course of evolution.", 
    "394": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is associated with increased oxidative stress, overexpression and activation of growth factor receptors, including those for transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta-RII), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-R), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF1-R). These pathways are believed to represent pathophysiological determinants of DN. Beyond perfect glycemic control, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are the most efficient treatment to delay glomerulosclerosis. Since their mechanisms of action remain uncertain, we investigated the effect of ACEI on the glomerular expression of these growth factor pathways in a model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. The early phase of diabetes was found to be associated with an increase in glomerular expression of IGF1-R, PDGF-R, and TGF-beta-RII and activation of IRS1, Erk 1/2, and Smad 2/3. These changes were significantly reduced by ACEI treatment. Furthermore, ACEI stimulated glutathione peroxidase activity, suggesting a protective role against oxidative stress. ACEI decreased ANG II production but also increased bradykinin bioavailability by reducing its degradation. Thus the involvement of the bradykinin pathway was investigated using coadministration of HOE-140, a highly specific nonpeptidic B2-kinin receptor antagonist. Almost all the previously described effects of ACEI were abolished by HOE-140, as was the increase in glutathione peroxidase activity. Moreover, the well-established ability of ACEI to reduce albuminuria was also prevented by HOE-140. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in the early phase of diabetes, ACEI reverse glomerular overexpression and activation of some critical growth factor pathways and increase protection against oxidative stress and that these effects involve B2-kinin receptor activation.", 
    "395": "The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by autoantibody production and vascular thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity. Autoantibodies generated against phospholipid and phospholipid-binding proteins often impair phospholipid-dependent clotting assays (lupus anticoagulants). These autoantibodies activate endothelial cells, platelets and biochemical cascades and can exist in autoimmune disorders such as lupus. Consistently positive antibodies may worsen the severity of thrombo-occlusive disease. The most common neurological manifestations of APS include stroke and transient ischaemic attacks due to arterial thromboses. Antiphospholipid antibodies may cause additional neurological impairments through both vascular and immune mechanisms. Antiaggregant or anticoagulant therapies are indicated for APS-related ischaemic strokes. Treatment regimens for asymptomatic antibody-positive patients and those with refractory disease remain controversial. There is scant literature on neurological APS manifestations in paediatric patients. Assessment of traditional cardiovascular and inherited thrombophilia risk factors is essential in patients with APS. Modifiable risk factors and valvular heart disease may worsen thrombotic and cerebrovascular outcomes. Alternative therapies such as statins, anti-malarials, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors warrant further research.", 
    "396": "We compared the levels of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other biochemical parameters in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with and without incipient diabetic nephropathy (iDN) and compared them with healthy control subjects. We also measured the effect of 3 and 6 months of ramipril treatment in diabetes patients with iDN. Compared with healthy controls, TGF-beta1 levels were increased in both groups of diabetes patients, whereas VEGF was only elevated in patients with iDN. Ramipril did not have a significant effect on TGF-beta1 or VEGF levels. We observed a significant decrease in microalbuminuria and cystatin C following ramipril treatment. Increased VEGF levels in patients with iDN suggest a role for this cytokine in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Cystatin C would make a suitable marker for the screening and assessment of iDN, and for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs.", 
    "397": "Antihypertensive treatment in diabetes mellitus, especially in diabetics known to have cardiac autonomic neuropathy, may have to consider the status of the autonomic nervous system. In diabetic subjects with cardiac autonomic neuropathy, vagal activity during the night is often reduced. The reduction results in relative or absolute sympathetic activation, which could increase cardiovascular risk. Pathophysiological and clinical data suggests that antihypertensive treatment should reduce rather than induce sympathetic activity in this setting. Beta blocking agents, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists of verapamil or diltiazem type and selective imidazoline receptor agonists reduce sympathetic activity and, therefore, may have a beneficial effect in diabetic patients with disturbed sympathovagal balance.",

The accuracy of post-CAPT or post-SAL plasma aldosterone values for diagnosing APA was estimated with the area under the receiver operator characteristics curves. Primary aldosteronism was found in 120 patients, of which 46 had an APA. No untoward effect occurred with either test. The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of plasma aldosterone for both tests was higher (P<0.0001) than that under the diagonal, but the between-test difference was borderline significant (P=0.054). The optimal aldosterone cutoff value for identifying APA was 13.9 and 6.75 ng/dL for the CAPT and SAL, respectively. Even at these cutoffs, sensitivity and specificity were moderate because of overlap of values between patients with and without APA. When examined in relation to sodium intake, the accuracy of the SAL surpassed that of the CAPT in the patients with a sodium intake <or=130 mEq per day; this difference waned at a higher Na(+) intake.

    "422": "In 569 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma renin concentration (PRC) were measured before and after 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with once-daily oral doses of aliskiren (150, 300 or 600 mg), irbesartan 150 mg or placebo.", 
    "423": "Aliskiren 150, 300 and 600 mg and irbesartan 150 mg significantly reduced mean cuff sitting systolic BP (SBP) from baseline (p < 0.001 vs. placebo). Aliskiren 150, 300 and 600 mg significantly reduced geometric mean PRA by 69%, 71% and 75% from baseline respectively (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Irbesartan 150 mg significantly increased PRA by 109% (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Aliskiren dose-dependently increased PRC from baseline by 157%, 246% and 497%, at 150, 300 and 600 mg respectively, compared with a 9% decrease with placebo (p < 0.05). PRC increased significantly more with aliskiren 300 and 600 mg compared with irbesartan 150 mg (105%; p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed no significant correlations between baseline PRA and changes in SBP in any of the treatment groups, but interestingly, the slopes of the regression lines between changes in SBP and log-transformed baseline PRA were +2.0 for placebo and -1.5, -1.8 and -2.3 for aliskiren 150, 300 and 600 mg respectively. The slope for irbesartan 150 mg (-1.4) was similar to that for aliskiren 150 mg.", 
    "424": "Aliskiren reduces SBP and PRA and increases PRC dose-dependently. In contrast, irbesartan reduces SBP but increases both PRC and PRA. As PRA is a measurement of angiotensin I-generating capacity, PRA can be used for measuring the ability of an antihypertensive agent to prevent the generation or action of Ang II, either directly (renin inhibitors, beta-blockers, central alpha(2)-agonists) or indirectly (AT(1)-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors).", 
    "425": "Although it is well known that the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an ominous complication in patients with liver cirrhosis, there has been no approved drug to prevent the development of HCC to date. We previously reported that the combined treatment of vitamin K2 (VK) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) significantly suppressed the experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. A 66-year-old Japanese woman with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis developed a dysplastic nodule in the liver detected by enhanced computed tomography along with elevation of the tumor markers, namely, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and lectin-reactive demarcation (AFP-L3), suggesting the presence of latent HCC. After oral administration of VK and ACE-I, the serum levels of both AFP and AFP-L3 gradually decreased without any marked alteration of the serum aminotransferase activity. After one-year treatment, not only the serum levels of AFP and AFP-L3 returned to the normal ranges, but also the dysplastic nodule disappeared. Since both VK and ACE-I are widely used without serious side effects, this combined regimen may become a new strategy for chemoprevention against HCC.", 
    "426": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril prevents myosin-induced experimental autoimmune myocarditis. Captopril inhibits production of angiotensin II and increases bradykinin signaling, among other actions. To test whether captopril inhibits disease through blockade of angiotensin signaling, we tested the ability of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, to prevent myosin-induced myocarditis. A/J mice immunized with the heavy chain of cardiac myosin in complete Freund's adjuvant develop acute myocarditis by day 21 post-immunization, consisting of severe focal inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis. Administration of losartan (250 mg/L in the drinking water) or captopril (75 mg/L in the drinking water) significantly reduced inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis in myosin-immunized mice. The heart weights and the heart weight-to-body weight ratios were also significantly reduced in both treatment groups. However, whereas captopril reduced myosin-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity, losartan did not. Both captopril-treated mice and losartan-treated mice showed a decrease in myosin-specific autoantibody production. Because losartan treatment significantly reduced myocarditis, fibrosis and autoantibody production in EAM, it is likely that prevention of angiotensin II receptor stimulation is a major mechanism underlying the inhibition of myosin-induced myocarditis by captopril.", 
    "427": "Aggressive inhibition of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may provide the best cardiovascular protection. We examined the effect of different doses of angiotensin II receptor blocker, Candesartan, on arterial elasticity, inflammatory and metabolic parameters in hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. 69 hypertensive patients were randomized into three groups: group 1 included patients treated with high doses of Candesartan (32 mg), group 2 included patients treated with conventional doses of Candesartan (16 mg), group 3 included patients that received antihypertensive treatment other that angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Patients were evaluated for lipid profile, HbA1C, insulin, C-peptide, hs-CRP, aldosterone, renin and Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Arterial elasticity was evaluated using pulse wave contour analysis method (HDI CR 2000, Eagan, Minnesota). In patients treated with high doses of Candesartan: large artery elasticity index (LAEI) increased from 8.6+/-2.8 to 16.6+/-5.1 ml/mm Hg x 100 after 6 months of treatment (p<0.0001). Small artery elasticity index (SAEI) increased from 2.7+/-1.3 to 5.9+/-2.8 ml/mm Hg x 100 (p<0.0001). Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased from 1881.5+/-527.5 to 1520.9+/-271.8 (p<0.0006). In patients treated with conventional doses of Candesartan: LAEI index increased from 11.0+/-3.5 to 14.4+/-3.2 ml/mm Hg x 100 (p<0.0001). SAEI increased during the study from 3.7+/-1.4 to 5.4+/-2.1 ml/mm Hg x 100 (p<0.0001). SVR decreased from 1699.8+/-327.6 to 1400.7+/-241 (p<0.0001). In the control group: neither LAE nor SAE improved during the treatment period. Although similar reduction in blood pressure was observed in all three groups, both LAE and SAE improved only in patients treated by ARBs. Treatment with high doses of Candesartan improves arterial stiffness to a greater extent than conventional doses of Candesartan, despite comparable changes in blood pressure.", 
    "428": "The ATP binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1/G1) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) are key molecules in cholesterol efflux and atherogenesis. These genes are regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and liver X receptor (LXR). Telmisartan is an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker which has been reported to act as a ligand for PPARgamma. We investigated whether PPARgamma-activating ARBs affect the expression of these genes and cholesterol efflux from macrophages.", 
    "429": "Telmisartan increased ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI mRNA levels in THP-1 macrophages in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. It also increased their protein levels and enhanced apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. The knockdown of PPARgamma by siRNA abolished the telmisartan-induced expression of these genes. The knockdown of LXRalpha resulted in the complete and partial abolishment of telmisartan-induced ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression, respectively. We also demonstrated that telmisartan-induced SR-BI expression was dependent on the PPARgamma pathway but not on the LXRalpha pathway. A luciferase assay using an ABCA1 promoter construct showed that telmisartan activated ABCA1 transcription, which was abolished if the LXR binding element was mutated, indicating that increased ABCA1 transcription by telmisartan is LXR-dependent.", 
    "430": "Our results showed that telmisartan enhanced both apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages by increasing ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI expression via PPARgamma-dependent and LXR-dependent/independent pathways.", 
    "431": "We investigated whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor could inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities in cerebral infarct lesions after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. After placebo or trandolapril (5 mg/kg per day) was administered orally for 7 days, we permanently occluded the right middle cerebral artery. ACE activity in extracts from the infarct side of placebo-treated rats was significantly higher than that in extracts from the non-infarct side from 5 days after MCAO, though they did not differ at 1 day. ACE activities in extracts from both hemispheric segments in the trandolapril-treated group were significantly decreased compared with those in the placebo-treated group before MCAO, and this significant reduction persisted even at 7 days after MCAO. In the placebo-treated group, MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities in the infarct side were significantly increased at 12 h and at 1 day after MCAO, respectively. Trandolapril treatment significantly reduced MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities to 68.5% and 53.2%, respectively. Seven days after MCAO, the ratios of infarct areas to the hemispheric sectional areas in placebo- and trandolapril-treated rats were 55.4+/-2.1% and 30.9+/-2.9%, respectively, and this difference was significant. Neurological severity scores were significantly improved from 1 to 7 days after MCAO in trandolapril-treated rats. Cumulative survival in trandolapril-treated rats was significantly increased compared with that in placebo-treated rats. Thus, the inhibition of MMP-9 by trandolapril might be part of the mechanism that prevents cerebral damage after cerebral ischemia.", 
    "432": "This study determined whether or not oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in fructose-induced hyperinsulinemic rats are associated with activation of the vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Four groups of rats were used. CONT rats were fed normal rat chow, CONT+CAP were fed normal rat chow and given 500 mg/L captopril in their drinking water, fructose-fed rats (FFR) were fed a high-fructose diet and FFR+CAP were fed the high-fructose diet plus captopril in water. After 8 weeks, the vascular reactivity of mesenteric artery segments was measured. Blood was analyzed for insulin, glucose, hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostane. Aortic and heart tissue were used for subjected to quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in FFR (p<0.05), and captopril treatment inhibited the blood pressure increase. Mesenteric artery dose-response curves to acetylcholine were shifted to the right in FFR (p<0.05) and were normal in FFR+CAP. Plasma insulin (p<0.05), hydrogen peroxide (p<0.02) and 8-isoprostane (p<0.05) were increased in FFR. Captopril treatment reducd hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostane concentrations. Aortic tissue mRNA expression levels were increased for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, p<0.05), angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R, p<0.02), NOX4 (p<0.02) and VCAM-1 (p<0.05) in FFR aortic samples. Captopril treatment reduced AT1R, NOX4 and VCAM-1 expression in FFR to levels not different from CONT. Similar changes in heart tissue mRNA expression for angiotensinogen, AT1R and NOX4 were also observed. These results demonstrate that vascular RAS is upregulated in FFR and support the hypothesis that vascular RAS mediates vascular dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress in FFR.",

    "445": "In the present study, we tested whether the decreased release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) observed in nitroglycerin tolerance is associated with the decrease in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH-2) activity. We further investigated the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species in the decrease in ALDH-2 activity. Tolerance was induced by exposure of isolated rat thoracic aortas and human umbical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to nitroglycerin in vitro or by pretreatment with nitroglycerin for 8 days in vivo. Pretreatment with ALDH-2 inhibitors and nitroglycerin significantly attenuated vasodilator responses to nitroglycerin concomitantly with a decrease in the release of CGRP from the isolated thoracic aorta. Nitroglycerin produced a depressor effect concomitantly with an increase in plasma concentrations of CGRP, and the effect of nitroglycerin was attenuated after pretreatment with an inhibitor of ALDH-2 or nitroglycerin for 8 days. Exposure of HUVEC to nitroglycerin for 16 h increased reactive oxygen species production and decreased ALDH-2 activity as well as cGMP production in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment with an ALDH-2 inhibitor also significantly decreased the cGMP production. However, tolerance to nitroglycerin in HUVEC was restored in the presence of N-acetylcysteine or captopril. The present results suggest that nitrate tolerance is, at least partially, associated with a decrease in endogenous CGRP release via a decrease in ALDH-2 activity as a result of stimulation of reactive oxygen species production.", 
    "446": "Arterial hypertension develops in up to 80% of renal transplant recipients. Uncontrolled hypertension induces left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure and death, but also promotes deterioration of allograft function. Cadaveric transplantation, delayed graft function, renal artery stenosis, presence of native kidneys, increased body weight and therapy with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids have been associated with an increased incidence of hypertension after kidney transplantation. Cyclosporine increases both systemic and renal vascular resistance, enhances sympathetic activation, endothelin production and, possibly, decreases vascular relaxation by decreasing the generation of nitric oxide. Tacrolimus has less pronounced prohypertensive role after renal transplantation. Corticosteroids contribute to the development of hypertension, since their withdrawal results in a significant decrease of blood pressure in the majority of patients. Renal artery stenosis occurs in almost 12% of hypertensive renal transplant recipients. It is a correctable cause of hypertension, and for this reason should be investigated in all suspected patients. Doppler ultrasonography is used as the screening method that is highly sensitive and specific in the hands of a well-experienced investigator. However, dependence of the method on the experience of the investigator is its major drawback. Magnetic resonance angiography and spinal computed tomography angiography are useful noninvasive methods, but arteriography remains a method for establishing the definitive diagnosis. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty, with or without placement of the stent, is successful in the majority of patients, but with a high incidence of restenoses (20%). Surgery is indicated for stenoses that cannot be treated with angioplasty or that recur. Auto-transplantation of the kidney with complex stenoses of graft arteries is useful in selected cases. Posttransplant hypertension should be aggressively treated to prevent the development of end-organ damage. Every effort should be invested in reducing immunosuppression when appropriate, together with salt restriction and weight reduction. Calcium channel blockers have good antihypertensive properties accompanied with minimization of cyclosporine-induced renal vasoconstriction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) should be used in patients with proteinuria. Renal function should be carefully monitored after their introduction since they may cause transitory deterioration of glomerular filtration and/or hyperkaliemia. ACEi can induce anemia in renal transplant recipients, side effect that is often used in the treatment of posttransplant erythrocytosis. All other antihypertensive drugs could be used, with minoxidil being the most potent one. Patients with resistant hypertension should be investigated for the presence of renal artery stenosis. After exclusion of rejection, renal artery stenosis and recurrent disease, in cases of severe hypertension, native kidneys laparoscopic nephrectomy should be considered.",

    "451": "Cardioprotective interventions are defined as interventions able to increase myocardial resistance to ischemia. The authors approach the issue of cardioprotection on the basis of the present knowledge about the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the injury produced by myocardial ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion. Reversible and irreversible injury are distinguished. The former is largely accounted for by the direct consequences of reduced ATP synthesis, which causes decreased ATP phosphorylation potential, acidosis and phosphate accumulation. The biochemical mechanisms leading to irreversible injury include osmotic overload, production of toxic lipid metabolites, cytosolic calcium overload, and generation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to membrane disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and possibly to the activation of apoptotic pathways. The major effect of the classical cardioprotective agents (nitrates, beta adrenergic antagonists, calcium channel blockers) consists in affecting ATP demand/supply ratio in such a way as to delay the decrease in ATP phosphorylation potential. Other drugs have been introduced, which allegedly interfere directly with the mechanisms responsible for irreversible ischemic injury. These include 3-ketoacyl-CoA tiolase inhibitors, modulators of intracellular calcium channels, ionic exchanger inhibitors, free radical scavengers, caspase inhibitors, purinergic agonists, K(+)(ATP) channel openers, and modulators of mitochondrial permeability transition. The results obtained with these substances in experimental models and in the clinical setting are discussed. Special attention is devoted to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, whose direct cardioprotective properties has recently been demonstrated.",

Mean decreases in systolic BP of 22.8 mm Hg and in diastolic BP of 12.4 mm Hg were recorded.", 
    "455": "This trial was established to reflect everyday clinical practice, and a treatment strategy based on the Per/Ind combination, administered as initial, replacement, or add-on therapy, led to normalization rates that were superior to those observed in Europe in routine practice. These results support recent hypertension guidelines which encourage the use of combination therapy in the management of arterial hypertension.", 
    "456": "Cardiovascular diseases are directly affected by arterial hypertension. When associated with diabetes mellitus, the potential deleterious effects are well amplified. Both conditions play a central role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Prevalence of hypertension is much higher among diabetic than non-diabetic patients, and the hypertensive patient is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Current international guidelines recommend aggressive reductions in blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with additional risk factors, including cardiovascular risk factors, and emphasize the relevance of intensive reduction in patients with diabetes mellitus; a goal of 130/80 mm Hg is required. To achieve BP target a combination of antihypertensives will be needed, and the use of long-acting drugs that are able to provide 24-hour efficacy with a once-daily dosing confers the noteworthy advantages of compliance improvement and BP variation lessening. Lower dosages of the individual treatments of the combination therapy can be administered for the same antihypertensive efficiency as that attained with high dosages of monotherapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers as a combination have theoretically compelling advantages for vessel homeostasis. Trandolapril/verapamil sustained release combination has showed beneficial effects on cardiac and renal systems as well as its antihypertensive efficacy, with no metabolic disturbances. This combination can be considered as an effective therapy for the diabetic hypertensive population.", 
    "457": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors today are the standard therapy of patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure due to their proven beneficial effects in left ventricular remodeling and left ventricular function. ACE inhibitors have also been demonstrated to lead to regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It is believed that the mechanism of action of LVH regression with ACE inhibitors arises from more than simple blood pressure reduction. LVH is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality independent of blood pressure. Moexipril hydrochloride is a long-acting, non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor that can be taken once daily for the treatment of hypertension. Moexipril has now also been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on LVH and can lead to LVH regression.", 
    "458": "Endothelial dysfunction is the initial pathophysiological step in a progression of vascular damage that leads to overt cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin II, the primary agent of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has a central role in endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, RAS blockade with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor provides a rational approach to reverse endothelial dysfunction, reduce microalbuminuria, and, thus, improves cardiovascular and renal prognosis. ARBs and ACE inhibitors act at different points in the RAS pathway and recent evidence suggests that there are differences regarding their effects on endothelial dysfunction. In addition to blood pressure lowering, studies have shown that ARBs reduce target-organ damage, including improvements in endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) Programme is expected to provide the ultimate evidence of whether improved endothelial function translates into reduced cardiovascular and renal events in high-risk patients, and to assess possible differential outcomes with telmisartan, the ACE inhibitor ramipril, or a combination of both (dual RAS blockade). Completion of ONTARGET is expected in 2008.",

The statin therapy demonstrated structural and functional benefits, including increased RBF and decreased BUN, independently of a change in MAP, while the ACE inhibition therapy demonstrated structural benefit in association with a decrease in MAP. An enhancement of these protective interventions in this autosomal dominant PKD model was not demonstrated with the combined treatment.", 
    "464": "This double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way balanced design crossover study included hypertensive patients aged 60-85 years with mean office-measured sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) 160-179 mm Hg and daytime SBP > or =135 mm Hg. After a 2-week run-in period, during which previous medications were discontinued, each patient received the following four treatments in randomized order for 4 weeks each: lercanidipine 10 mg (L), enalapril 20 mg (E), lercanidipine 10 mg plus enalapril 20 mg (L/E) and placebo (P). At the end of each treatment period, office trough blood pressure (BP) was measured and a 24-h Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) was performed. Seventy-five patients (mean age 66 years, office BP 168/92 mm Hg, daytime SBP 151 mm Hg) were randomized and 62 completed the study with four valid post-baseline ABPMs. The administration of P, L, E and L/E was associated with a mean 24-h SBP of 144, 137, 133 and 127 mm Hg, respectively. All active treatments significantly reduced the mean 24-h SBP in comparison with placebo, but L/E was significantly more effective than L and E alone. Similarly, office SBP was significantly more reduced with L/E (-16.9 mm Hg) than with L (-5.0 mm Hg) or E (-5.9 mm Hg). A BP <140/90 mm Hg was recorded in 18% of patients with L, 19% with E and 45% with L/E. Two patients on P and two on L/E were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events. In conclusion, combination therapy with L/E has additive antihypertensive effects on both ambulatory and office BP in elderly patients and is well tolerated.", 
    "465": "1. Heart rate (HR) turbulence describes short-term sinus rhythmic fluctuation after a single premature ventricular beat. Turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) are two essential parameters in HR turbulence. Turbulence onset and TS have been used to evaluate cardiac autonomic nerve function. 2. In the present study, we measured the HR turbulence in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and determined the possible role of benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), on these parameters. There were three groups: control, DCM and DCM treated with benazepril. The control group consisted of normal subjects with PVB, but no structural heart disease. Ambulatory electrocardiogram, blood pressure and echocardiography were analysed. 3. There was an increase in TO and a decrease in TS in DCM patients. Benazepril treatment (10 mg/day, p.o.) reduced those changes. There were no significant differences in blood pressure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between DCM patients and DCM patients treated with benazepril. 4. Linear regression analysis showed that TO was negatively correlated with LVEF, whereas TS was positively correlated with LVEF, in the DCM group. After benazepril treatment, the correlations between TO and TS and LVEF disappeared. 5. It is concluded that the TO and TS of HR turbulence are altered in patients with DCM. These alterations indicate a dysfunction of the autonomic control of cardiac electrophysiology in DCM patients. Although TO and TS are correlated with LVEF in DCM patients, the effect of benazepril in improving HR turbulence parameters is not a result of its action on heart function, which suggests a new beneficial effect of ACEI in the treatment of DCM patients.", 
    "466": "1. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with enalapril on the sensitivity of cardiopulmonary reflexes 30 days after myocardial infarction in Wistar rats. 2. Animals were divided into four groups: (i) sham operated, receiving vehicle (SHAM); (ii) infarcted, receiving vehicle (0.9% NaCl; INF); (iii) sham operated, receiving enalapril (SHAME); and (iv) infarcted, receiving enalapril (INFE). 3. Enalapril was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day. Serotonin (4-32 microg/kg, i.v.) was administered in order to activate the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, which was estimated as the percentage of reduction in heart rate. 4. The volume-sensitive cardiopulmonary reflex was induced by saline overload and evaluated as the percentage increase in sodium and volume renal excretion. At the end of the experiments, rats were killed and hearts excised to estimate the size of the infarction. The weight of the kidneys, lungs, liver and cardiac chambers as ratios of bodyweight was used to estimate the extent of hypertrophy. 5. The results showed an impairment in the sensitivity of the cardiopulmonary reflexes in the INF group compared with the SHAM and SHAME groups. We observed right ventricle and pulmonary hypertrophy, a reduction in mean and systolic arterial pressure and an increase in heart rate in INF animals. In the INFE group, nearly all the parameters were normal compared with the INF group, except for systolic arterial pressure, which was only partially improved. 6. The main finding of the present study was that treatment with enalapril normalized the sensitivity of the cardiopulmonary reflexes, which could be due, in part, to the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy. The present study provides information about the beneficial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors by normalizing the cardiopulmonary reflexes involved with the regulation of volume and sodium, as well as control of arterial pressure and heart rate in infarcted animals.", 
    "467": "1. High-sodium intake may increase blood pressure and diabetes is a salt-sensitive condition. In the present study, we evaluated cardiovascular changes and their neurohumoral mechanisms in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats that underwent chronic salt loading. 2. We studied male Wistar rats (150-280 g) 14 days after the injection of either STZ (50 mg/kg, i.v.; D; n = 18) or citrate buffer (C; n = 16). After the induction of diabetes, animals were maintained for 14 days with free access to standard rat chow and tap water (C and D groups) or 1% NaCl solution (C-S and D-S groups). We conducted two experiments. Experiment 1 consisted of basal arterial pressure (AP) measurement (30 min) followed by the evaluation of AP responsiveness to phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. One day later, with the rats anaesthetized, a blood sample was collected to test for glycaemia, plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and renin. Kidneys were removed for the determination of tissue ACE activity. Experiment 2 comprised 24 h urine collection followed by 3 days of cardiovascular records, which consisted of a 30 min basal AP measurement, followed by injection of blockers of the vasopressin system, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathetic system. Basal haemodynamic data, baroreflex evaluation and AP responses to blockade of the vasopressin system with vasopressin V(1) receptor antagonist (aAVP; 10 mg/kg, i.v.), the RAS by losartan (10 mg/kg, i.v.) and the sympathetic system by hexamethonium (20 mg/kg, i.v.) were determined. 3. Glycaemia was similar between C and C-S (P = 0.612) and between D and D-S (P = 0.552), but higher in diabetic compared with non-diabetic rats (P < 0.0001). The D-S rats had an increment of 24% in mean AP compared with D (120 +/- 4 vs 97 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively; P = 0.0001), which was not seen in C-S compared with C rats. A positive association was noted between urinary sodium and mean AP (r = 0.37; P = 0.04). Plasma renin was undetectable in D-S rats. The response to acute drug blockade of vasopressin and the RAS was similar among groups, but hexamethonium elicited a more pronounced decrease in AP in D-S compared with D rats (P = 0.001). 4. The main neurohumoral mechanisms of salt-induced cardiovascular changes in STZ-diabetes are increased sodium and vascular sensitivity to adrenergic stimuli, which act in combination to produce a final result of higher AP levels, a finding not observed in control rats. Baroreflex derangements induced by diabetes were not affected by salt overload.",

After a brief presentation of the epidemiology and of the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed for explaining the disease, the advantages and drawbacks of the different treatment approaches are discussed, along with their pathopysiological rationale. A particular emphasis is dedicated to the scientific foundations underlying the development of acetazolamide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as promising therapeutic agents for CMS, as well as the clinical evidence existing so far on their usefulness in the treatment of CMS. Various methodological issues that need to be addressed in future clinical studies on efficacy of therapies for CMS are discussed. There is also a brief discussion on potential treatment options for chronic high altitude pulmonary hypertension. Closing remarks on the need of taking increasingly into account the development and implementation of preventive measures are made.", 
    "469": "The course of diabetic nephropathy is affected by several factors that can be manipulated. In primary prevention, near normal metabolic control beginning at the time of the diagnosis of diabetes diminishes the risk of microalbuminuria to an extent depending on the HbA1c level attained. Hypertensive diabetics should be consistently treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blocking agents. In secondary prevention, a multifactorial therapy is able to stop or retard further progression. Its components are a sustained decrease of blood pressure in the normotensive range using RAS-blocking agents (normotensive patients should also be treated) as well as near normal metabolic control that takes into account the changing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of blood glucose-lowering drugs in renal insufficiency. Consideration of further factors (smoking, protein intake, anemia) and several general nephroprotective measures complete the treatment spectrum. Therapy for dyslipidemia and the administration of aspirin are important in view of the high cardiovascular morbidity. It is essential to monitor kidney function and the therapeutic components at short intervals.", 
    "470": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the most efficient pharmacologic agents to delay the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This is a multipharmacologic approach that inhibits angiotensin II formation while increasing kinin concentrations. Considerable attention has been focused on the role of decreased angiotensin II levels; however, the role of increased kinin levels is gaining in interest. Kinins affect cellular physiology by interacting with one of two receptors being the more inducible B1 and the more constitutive B2 receptors. This study utilizes the mouse remnant kidney of 20 weeks duration as a model of ESRD. Whole mouse genome microarrays were used to evaluate gene expression in the remnant kidneys of wild type, B1 and B2 receptor knockout animals. The microarray data indicate that gene families involved in vascular damage, inflammation, fibrosis, and proteinuria were upregulated, whereas gene families involved in cell growth, metabolism, lipid, and protein biosynthesis were downregulated in the remnant kidneys. Interestingly, the microarray analyses coupled to histological evaluations are suggestive of a possible protective role of kinins operating through the B2 receptor subtype in this model of renal disease. The results highlight the potential of microarray technology for unraveling complex mechanisms contributing to chronic renal failure.", 
    "471": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is localized to the glomerular epithelial cells. Since ACE2 promotes the degradation of angiotensin II, a decrease in ACE2 activity could lead to the development of glomerular injury. We gave a specific ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760, for 4 weeks to mice rendered diabetic with streptozotocin. The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was increased along with expansion of the glomerular matrix in diabetic mice treated with the inhibitor compared to the vehicle-treated mice. Glomerular staining of ACE was increased in the diabetic group and was further significantly increased in the diabetic group treated with MLN-4760. In renal vessels, ACE expression was also increased in the diabetic mice and, again, further increased in those diabetic mice treated with the ACE2 inhibitor. Our study shows that chronic pharmacologic ACE2 inhibition worsens glomerular injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice in association with increased ACE expression.",

    "478": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important part in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension and the complications it causes in organs (the heart, the circulatory system, the brain, the kidneys), heart failure and kidney diseases. Materials that block the most upstream point of the RAAS cascade (ACE inhibitors - ACEI, AT1,-receptor (AT1R) blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers) have greatly expanded our options in the treatment and primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and renal diseases. ACEI and AT1R blockers interrupt the normal feedback provided by the release of renin into the circulatory system from the kidneys. After they are applied the reactive increase in active circulating renin leads to increased creation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and the subsequent return of aldosterone secretions to pre-treatment values (\"escape\" phenomenon). The possible negative effect of these intermediary products of an incomplete blockade of RAAS on organ complications lead to an effort to develop a material that could block the renin-angiotensin cascade at its first stage--i.e. a renin blocker. The first efforts with renin antibodies or peptide analogues of renin prosegments failed to satisify the basic requirements for long-term medication--effectiveness when used orally. In recent years the first non-peptidic, oral renin ihibitor providing sustained effects has been developed, aliskiren fumarate. Aliskiren reduces BP depending on the dose (50-300 mg/day) in monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren lowers plasma renin activity (PRA) and neutralises the activation of the RAAS triggered by hydrochlorothiazide. Ambulatory BP monitoring has shown that taking the medicine once a day has a 24-hour effect and its continued residence in the kidneys suggests renoprotective effects. The compound is in the third stage of clinical tests as a monotherapy or in combination for the treatment of hypertension. It has also been shown to have an influence on the regression of cardiac hypertrophy (Aliskiren in Left-Ventricular Hypertrophy trial - ALLAY), the treatment of heart failure (Aliskiren Observation of Heart Failure Treatment trial - ALOFT) and diabetic (Aliskiren in the Evaluation of Proteinuria in Diabetes trial - AVOID). In April 206, the FDA permitted the use of aliskiren in the USA for the treatment of high BP and it is currently undergoing testing in Europe. The renin inhibitor has minimal undesirable side effects, like AT1-receptor blockers. The slightly lower effectiveness ofaliskiren than AT1-receptor blockers in reducing BP is caused by the fact that it does not block bradykinins. It is recommended as a monotherapy for clinical use or in combination with other antihypertensive medicines for conditions with high levels of PRA including its rise after diuretics, ACEI and AT1-receptor blockers. Aliskiren could therefore be used primarily with young patients, Caucasians, persons with ACEI intolerance, and also in diseases where angiotensin II is involved in the pathogenesis and the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is also safe for persons with concurrent renal problems, because it is mainly removed by the liver without great interference with other materials. Like ACEI, the renin inhibitor has a vasodilatory effect which could potentially improve the elasticity of arteries. The medicine has the same limitations and contraindications as ACEI and AT1R blockers, such as pregnancy and bilateral renal artery stenosis. A definitive assessment of the benefit of this new class of medicines and its broad application in the treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases will require demonstration of its long-term effect on morbidity and mortality, as well as comparison with other RAAS blockers in long clinical studies, which represent research programmes lasting another 7 to 8 years.",

Much of the 20% all-cause mortality benefit recorded during the study could be attributed to a 45% reduction in sudden death--a fatal outcome that traditionally has proved resistant to medical intervention. These results were obtained with an omega-3 PUFA dose of 1 g/day, which is much lower than was routinely being used at the time the study was initiated (e.g. 4 g/day for hypertriglyceridemia). One consequence of this low-dose regimen was that the tolerability profile of omega-3 PUFAs during GISSI-Prevenzione was considered highly satisfactory, with low adverse event incidence rates and low rates of discontinuation due to adverse events. Time-course analysis established that much of the survival benefit of omega-3 PUFA treatment in GISSI-Prevenzione was realized during the early months of the trial.

The benefits of omega-3 PUFA therapy were also apparent in patients at all standards of adherence to a healthy diet and may have been augmented in patients with the best dietary profile. Patients with diabetes mellitus (approximately 15% of the study cohort) appeared to benefit from omega-3 PUFAs to at least the same extent as the general study population; the treatment effect on sudden death was progressively more pronounced as left ejection fraction declined. Cost-effectiveness analyses undertaken from a third-party payer perspective for Italy revealed that the cost of low-dose treatment with highly purified omega-3 PUFAs was approximately Euro 25,000 per life-year gained.",

    "511": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) has become an epidemic in the United States, with approximately 550,000 new cases annually. With the evolution of pharmacotherapy targeting neurohormonal pathways, the annual mortality in subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF has dramatically improved from 52% in the seminal CONSENSUS trial to less than 20% in more recent trials. Suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remains the first line of neurohormonal blockade followed by the addition of selective beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. For patients with NYHA class I and II symptoms, mortality rates have decreased to approximately 5% or less per year with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone receptor blockers. However, after achieving optimal doses of the indicated pharmacotherapy, and despite the additional benefits obtained with biventricular pacemakers, there are still many patients who continue to experience signs and symptoms of CHF. Recognizing the beneficial effects of the above treatments on left ventricular (LV) remodeling, strategies have been developed to surgically reshape the left ventricle in patients with LV dilation who have associated poor LV function. This review will discuss the techniques and recent developments regarding surgical reshaping of the dilated, dysfunctional, and remodeled left ventricle.",

Serum potassium also increased significantly with the administration of angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or beta-blockers. A combination of diabetes and RAS inhibitor administration significantly increased serum potassium compared to each factor alone in patients with a serum creatinine level below 1.5 mg/dL but not in those with a higher serum creatinine level. According to step-wise multiple regression analyses, an elevated serum creatinine level had the strongest positive correlation with the serum potassium level, followed by diabetes, ACEI use, ARB use, and age.",

Following 15 min of no-flow ischaemia, reperfusion systolic function was depressed and left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was elevated in diabetic hearts. ET(A)-RB or ACE-I treatment significantly improved recovery of reperfusion systolic and diastolic function, without differences between groups. Hydroxyproline (an index of tissue fibrosis) and malondialdehyde (a measure of tissue oxidative stress) were elevated at the end of reperfusion in diabetic, compared to nondiabetic hearts.

In parallel, the expression levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were increased by four- to fivefold, in Npr1(-/-) mice hearts compared with control animals. The NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts of Npr1(-/-) mice hearts was increased by fourfold compared with wild-type Npr1(+/+) mice hearts. Treatments with captopril or hydralazine equally attenuated SBP; however, only captopril significantly decreased the HW/BW ratio and suppressed cytokine gene expression in Npr1(-/-) mice hearts. The ventricular cGMP level was reduced by almost sixfold in Npr1(-/-) mice compared with wild-type control mice.

In patients with chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, enhanced activation of neurohormonal systems including sympathetic nerve and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays the most important role in its progression and poor prognosis. Therefore, principle of treatment of chronic heart failure is inhibition of the elevated neurohormonal activity. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers are class I drugs of choice. In patients who can not tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers are used as replacement. In patients with severe heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class > III], aldosterone antagonists are added. Diuretics are also class I drug necessary for an improvement of symptoms of heart failure.

Changes in anthropometric parameters, blood lipid spectrum, lipid peroxidation in blood plasma and thrombocytes, and the antioxidative protection of liquid part of blood and platelets, as well as the aggregation activity of thrombocytes were assessed. The data received were processed using Student criterion and system multifactor analysis. The study shows that the use of fozinopril in patients with AH and metabolic syndrome attenuates peroxidation syndrome and optimizes thrombocyte aggregation.

CHARM demonstrated that an angiotensin-receptor blocker at a proven dose is an effective and safe therapy as an alternative or in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure, 55% of whom were receiving beta-adrenergic blockers. These benefits include reductions in cardiovascular mortality rate as well as in hospitalization for heart failure.

Most frequently, antiarrhythmic agents used to reestablish and maintain sinus rhythm do not provide satisfactory clinical effect. Understanding electrophysiological mechanisms of initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation is the best way to develop optimal therapeutic approaches. This aim of this study was to assess the prospects of correcting paroxysmal (persistent) form of atrial fibrillation with termination treatment, ACE inhibitors, and omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. The subjects of the study were 90 patients with documented episodes of atrial fibrillation of less than 48-hour duration. The observation lasted 12 months. The results show that \"tablets in the pocket\" strategy is the most effective and safe method of treatment of rare episodes of atrial fibrillation in patients with mild structural heart diseases; the terminating effectiveness of propanorm was 79% during hospital treatment and 88% in outpatients in the selected group of patients without a significant number of side effects. Treatment with lisinopril (dapril) was followed by a decrease in the number of paroxysms, duration of arrhythmia episodes, and a tendency to transformation into asymptomatic form. A possible mechanism of this positive effect of dapril on the paroxysmal form of atrial fibrillation is leveling of local electrophysiological effects of angiotensin II in a form of changing time of intra- and interventricular atrial conduction. Adding omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids to termination therapy decrease the number atrial fibrillation episodes and the time to their termination.", 
    "597": "The adjustment of medications and dosages to the needs of individual patients with heart failure is mostly intuitive, but even when their effect on global myocardial function is measured by classic indexes, their effect on segmental function is overlooked. This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of using echocardiographic myocardial strain imaging to evaluate the effect of medication on global and segmental function in 21 ambulatory patients with heart failure (mean age 65+/-11 years) who had echocardiographic studies performed before and 2 hours after ingesting their regular morning medications. The ejection fraction, global and regional strain, and time to regional peak strain were compared between the 2 examinations. Medication induced no significant changes in mean ejection fraction (28.6+/-7.8% to 27.5+/-9.9%) and mean global strain (-9.5+/-3.6% to -9.8+/-3.2%). Changes in segmental strain depended on baseline function: normal segments (peak strain more negative than -12%) deteriorated (-15.5+/-2.7% to -13.7+/-4.6%, p<0.0001), but dysfunctional segments (peak strain less negative than -8%) improved (-5.3+/-2.0% to -7.4+/-4.3%, p<0.0001). Medication also improved segmental synchronization: average time to peak strain of segments in which peak strain was attained before aortic valve closure increased (325+/-69 to 375+/-100 ms, p<0.0001), but that of segments with postsystolic shortening at baseline decreased (451+/-93 to 435+/-93 ms, p<0.006). Thus, the time interval between time to peak strain of segments with systolic and post-systolic shortening at baseline was halved after medication. In conclusion, medications for heart failure induced an increase in the echocardiographically determined peak strain of myocardial segments with impaired function at baseline but decreased the peak strain of normally contracting segments. Medications also improved the synchronization of myocardial contraction. Neither the global ejection fraction nor global strain reflected these changes. Thus, medication tended to improve the homogeneity of left ventricular contraction.",

Best medical treatment is beneficial even in patients who eventually need invasive treatment, as the safety, immediate success, and durability of intervention is greatly improved in patients who adhere to best medical treatment. In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that the ACE-inhibitor ramipril and different statins, together with antiplatelet drugs, reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in PAD. Patients with PAD are really a category of patients with a very high cardiovascular risk burden for fatal and nonfatal cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events; therefore, they need to be treated not only for local problems deriving from arteriopathy (intermittent claudication, rest pain and/or ulcers) but, above all, for preventing vascular events. Statins not only lower the risk of vascular events, but they also improve the symptoms associated with PAD. Statins exert beneficial pleiotropic effects on hemostasis, vasculature and inflammatory markers; there is also evidence that statins improve renal function considering that the plasma creatinine level is considered as an emerging vascular risk factor.",

A number of large placebo-controlled multi-center trials in post-myocardial infarction and heart failure patients have shown the ability of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system medications to reduce the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze whether chronic long-term inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can prevent most of the deleterious effects due to aging in the cardiovascular system of the normal rat. The main objective was to compare two strategies of ANG II blockade: a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) and an AT(1) receptor blocker (AT(1)RB). A control group remained untreated; treatment was initiated 2 wk after weaning. A CEI, enalapril (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), or an AT(1)RB, losartan (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), was used to inhibit the RAS. Systolic blood pressure, body weight, and water and food intake were recorded over the whole experimental period. Heart, aorta, and mesenteric artery weight as well as histological analysis of cardiovascular structure were performed at 6 and 18 mo. Twenty animals in each of the three experimental groups were allowed to die spontaneously. The results demonstrated a significant protective effect on the function and structure of the cardiovascular system in all treated animals. Changes observed at 18 mo of age in the hearts and aortas were quite significant, but each treatment completely abolished this deterioration. The similarity between the results detected with either enalapril or losartan treatment clearly indicates that most of the effects are exerted through AT(1) receptors.

Assuming an absolute risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus on older drugs of approximately 10% over 5 years and a relative benefit on the newer drugs of approximately 30%, about 100 patients would have to be treated for 5 years with the newer agents to avert approximately three iatrogenic cases of diabetes. Whether or not new-onset diabetes is associated with increased risk is uncertain. In most patients, optimization of treatment at acceptable tolerance requires rotation through and combination of several drug classes.

    "635": "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is a ubiquitously synthesized peptide that, along with IGF-II, acts via the IGF-R type I receptor. IGF-I and its receptor are expressed in the adrenal gland of humans and bovines, the secretion of which they seem to stimulate. As in humans and cows, the main glucocorticoid hormone secreted by guinea-pig adrenals is cortisol, and hence we have studied the adrenocortical effects of IGF-I in this species. In vivo experiments showed that prolonged IGF-I administration raised the plasma concentration of cortisol in both normal and dexamethasone/captopril-treated guinea pigs, thereby ruling out the possibility that IGF-I may act by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the renin-angiotensin system. In vitro experiments demonstrated that IGF-I enhanced basal, but not maximally agonist [ACTH and angiotensin-II (Ang-II)]-stimulated, cortisol secretion from freshly dispersed guinea-pig inner adrenocortical cells. The IGF-I immuno-neutralization suppressed the IGF-I secretagogue effect, without altering the cortisol response to both ACTH and Ang-II. IGF-I raised cyclic-AMP and inositol triphosphate release from dispersed guinea-pig cells, and the effect was reversed by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ-22536 and the phospholipase-C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122. SQ-22536, U-73122, the protein kinase (PK) A inhibitor H-89 and the PKC inhibitor calphostin-C decreased by approximately 50% the cortisol response of dispersed cells to IGF-I, and the combined exposure to SQ-22536 and U-73122 abolished it. We conclude that IGF-I stimulates glucocorticoid secretion from guinea-pig adrenocortical cells, acting via selective receptors coupled to both the adenylate cyclase/PKA- and PLC/PKC-dependent signaling cascades.",

In general, thiazide diuretics and conventional beta blockers decrease insulin sensitivity and increase new-onset diabetes, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers have neutral or beneficial effects on these parameters.

This 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the tolerability and antihypertensive efficacy of the novel direct renin inhibitor aliskiren with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril in patients with severe hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP)>or=105 mm Hg and <120 mm Hg). In all, 183 patients were randomized (2:1) to aliskiren 150 mg (n=125) or lisinopril 20 mg (n=58) with dose titration (to aliskiren 300 mg or lisinopril 40 mg) and subsequent addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) if additional BP control was required. Aliskiren-based treatment (ALI) was similar to lisinopril-based treatment (LIS) with respect to the proportion of patients reporting an adverse event (AE; ALI 32.8%; LIS 29.3%) or discontinuing treatment due to AEs (ALI 3.2%; LIS 3.4%). The most frequently reported AEs in both groups were headache, nasopharyngitis and dizziness. At end point, ALI showed similar mean reductions from baseline to LIS in msDBP (ALI -18.5 mm Hg vs LIS -20.1 mm Hg; mean treatment difference 1.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.0, 4.4)) and mean sitting systolic blood pressure (ALI -20.0 mm Hg vs LIS -22.3 mm Hg; mean treatment difference 2.8 mm Hg (95% CI -1.7, 7.4)). Responder rates (msDBP<90 mm Hg and/or reduction from baseline>or=10 mm Hg) were 81.5% with ALI and 87.9% with LIS. Approximately half of patients required the addition of HCTZ to achieve BP control (ALI 53.6%; LIS 44.8%). In conclusion, ALI alone, or in combination with HCTZ, exhibits similar tolerability and antihypertensive efficacy to LIS alone, or in combination with HCTZ, in patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "660": "The brain possesses the same renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as the systemic circulation. Recent experimental studies have shown that the brain RAS plays an important role in stroke and neuronal protection through its effector peptide angiotensin (Ang) II. Ang II exerts its stroke-protective effects through stimulation of Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptors. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) exert a dual influence, which is important in their stroke protective effects. They selectively block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors, decreasing local vasoconstriction, and allow free Ang II to stimulate the unoccupied AT2 receptor and increase local vasodilation, resulting in the alleviation of local brain ischemia and limiting the volume and extent of brain loss. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, by decreasing the amount of Ang II production, may diminish the stroke-protective effects of Ang II. This perhaps could be a reason for the inferior stroke-protective effect of ACE inhibitors compared with ARBs, which has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. The evidence for this effect of ARBs compared with ACE inhibitors, however, is only indirect. Ongoing clinical trials with head-to-head comparisons of ARBs and ACE inhibitors will hopefully provide the needed information.",

Blood pressure, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the molar ratio of PAI-1/tPA were determined before treatment and 6 weeks later. Blood pressure decreased in both groups (candesartan, 155/85 mm Hg to 140/84 mm Hg; P<.05; lisinopril, 152/85 mm Hg to 138/83 mm Hg; P<.05). The fibrinolytic balance was significantly different between treatment groups (molar ratio of PAI-1/tPA: candesartan, 3.66 [2.2;] lisinopril, 5.44 [2.6;] P<.05). In contrast to lisinopril, the balance between coagulation and fibrinolytic activity shifted toward fibrinolysis during candesartan treatment.", 
    "662": "We examined the effects of increasing the recommended initial doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or of switching to combination therapy with both drugs, on diabetic nephropathy. Hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with urinary albumin excretion (ACR) between 100 and 300 mg/g creatinine (Cre) were assigned to the following five groups in which an antihypertensive drug was administered at a recommended initial dose for 48 weeks, and then either the dose was doubled or an additional drugs was added to regimen for the following 48 weeks: N, nifedipine-CR (N) 20 mg/day (initial dose); T, ACEI temocapril (T) 2 mg/day; C, ARB candesartan (C) 4 mg/day; T+C, T first and then addition of C; C+T, C first and then addition of C. ACR decreased in the T (n=34), C (n=40), T+C (n=37) and C+T (n=35) groups, but not in the N group (n=18). However, the anti-proteinuric effect was less in the T than in the C, T+C or C+T groups, while no differences existed among the latter three. In each group, there were significant linear relationships between attained BP and ACR; however, the regression lines were shifted toward lower ACR level in the renin-angiotensin system-inhibition groups compared with the N group. These results indicate that an ACEI and/or ARB is superior to a CCB in retarding diabetic nephropathy, while the combination of low doses of ACEI and ARB has effects similar to those of high-dose ARB. Even among patients treated with an ACEI and/or ARB, lowering BP is important.", 
    "663": "It has been reported that a substantial majority of hypertensives receive insufficient blood pressure (BP) control. As combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension, Ca channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin II (AII) receptor blockers (ARBs), and/or AII-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are mainly prescribed, while the efficacy of alpha(1)-blockers in such combination therapy remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a low dose of an alpha(1)-blocker added to combination therapy with CCBs and either ARBs or ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension. Subjects were 41 hypertensive patients (23 women and 18 men, mean age 66+/-12 years) who had been followed at the National Kyushu Medical Center. All patients showed poor BP control despite haven taken a combination of CCBs and ARBs or ACE inhibitors for more than 3 months. Doxazosin at a dose of 1 to 2 mg was added to each treatment regimen. The changes in various clinical parameters, including BP and blood chemistry, following the addition of doxazosin were then evaluated. The mean follow-up period was 170 days. BP decreased from 152+/-14/81+/-12 mmHg to 135+/-14/70+/-11 mmHg after the addition of doxazosin at a mean dose of 1.5 mg/day (p<0.001). When good systolic blood pressure (SBP) control was defined as <140 mmHg, the prevalence of patients with good SBP control increased from 24% to 61% (p<0.01). Similarly, the prevalence of patients with good diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control (<90 mmHg) increased from 78% to 98% (p<0.01). Patients whose SBP decreased more than 10 mmHg (n=25) showed significantly higher baseline SBP, serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels compared to those who showed less SBP reduction (<10 mmHg) (n=16, p<0.01). Comparable BP reductions were obtained between obese (body mass index [BMI] > or =25, DeltaBP at 3 months: -15+/-15/-12+/-9 mmHg, n=18) and non-obese (BMI<25, DeltaBP: -14+/-19/-7+/-8 mmHg, n=23) patients. The results suggest that addition of a low dose of the alpha(1)-blocker doxazosin effectively reduces BP in patients taking CCBs and ARBs or ACE inhibitors. Thus, doxazosin seems to be useful as a third-line antihypertensive drug.",

    "676": "A major challenge in the field of protein-protein docking is to discriminate between the many wrong and few near-native conformations, i.e. scoring. Here, we introduce combinatorial complex-type-dependent scoring functions for different types of protein-protein complexes, protease/inhibitor, antibody/antigen, enzyme/inhibitor and others. The scoring functions incorporate both physical and knowledge-based potentials, i.e. atomic contact energy (ACE), the residue pair potential (RP), electrostatic and van der Waals' interactions. For different type complexes, the weights of the scoring functions were optimized by the multiple linear regression method, in which only top 300 structures with ligand root mean square deviation (L_RMSD) less than 20 A from the bound (co-crystallized) docking of 57 complexes were used to construct a training set. We employed the bound docking studies to examine the quality of the scoring function, and also extend to the unbound (separately crystallized) docking studies and extra 8 protein-protein complexes. In bound docking of the 57 cases, the first hits of protease/inhibitor cases are all ranked in the top 5. For the cases of antibody/antigen, enzyme/inhibitor and others, there are 17/19, 5/6 and 13/15 cases with the first hits ranked in the top 10, respectively. In unbound docking studies, the first hits of 9/17 protease/inhibitor, 6/19 antibody/antigen, 1/6 enzyme/inhibitor and 6/15 others' complexes are ranked in the top 10.

    "677": "Nephrologists should be aware the fact that the angioedema is a common side effect not only under angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors treatment but also under sartans therapy. The frequency of angioedema under ACE inhibitors is estimated at 1 to 7 per thousand. The physiopathology of ACE angioedema implicates the lack of degradation of kinines due to the inhibition of multiple enzymes activity including ACE. Angioedema under sartans seems less frequent than this observed under ACE inhibitors. Its mechanism remains poorly defined, but implicates the increase of kinine production via the stimulation of angiotensin receptor type II, and/or the lack of degradation of kinines via multiple enzymes other than ACE. The frequency of the apparition of angioedema under sartans in patients who had have angioedema under ACE inhibitors is inconsistent and varied from 7.7% to 50%. Reports indicated that angioedema under ACE or sartans could have a spontaneous regression. However, the relapse of angioedema under these drugs should lead to the diagnosis of iatrogenic etiology, and to the drugs withdrawal. ACE inhibitors/Sartans-associated angioedema episodes need to be reported to the French Adverse Event Reporting System database to evaluate their frequency and to avoid severe consequences.", 
    "678": "In this editorial review on the optimal antihypertensive treatment for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, we start with the controversy triggered by Casas et al., for proposing a bitherapy optimal not only for nephroprotection, but also for global cardiovascular protection. The incidence of cardiovascular complications are indeed much greater than the occurrence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in these patients, so that their prevention has at least the same priority. We explain the huge amount of discordant papers, on the basis of methodology deficiencies in the studies aiming at evidencing the truth of 2 antinomic concepts underlying this controversy: 1) \"The correction by antihypertensive drugs of the cardiovascular risk excess in hypertensive patients is exclusively related to their blood pressure lowering effect, the optimal blood pressure (BP) level being defined by epidemiologists at 115/75 mmHg\"; 2) \"Independently of BP lowering effect, antihypertensive drugs may have intrinsic, protective or deleterious, renal and cardiovascular effects which may be variable according to the target organ\". We think that truth is conciliating and that both mechanisms should not be exclusive. However more rigorous studies are still needed to evidence it. Meanwhile we propose the optimal therapy by hypokaliemic diuretics (thiazides+/-loop diuretics according to glomerular filtration decline)+inhibitors of the angiotensin AT1-receptor (ACE inhibitors or AT1RB), in preference to the association of dihydropyridines with diuretics. This recommendation is strong however, only for CKD patients with macroproteinuria. The priority that we give to diuretic therapy is based on the evidence that this class confers good prevention against both heart failure and strokes, which is not the case for all AT1-inhibitors and dihydropyridines. Furthermore the diuretics are the drugs with the longest antihypertensive effect (many weeks) and their efficiency in CKD patients is proportional to the sodium depletion they initially induce and therefore to the dose (specially of the loop diuretics). Indeed volemia control is an incontrovertible factor for optimal BP control in renal insufficiency. As regards the use of betablockers, they should no more be considered as first drug for hypertension because they have the strongest diabetogenic effect. They should be used selectively for their specific cardiologic indications such as angina, heart failure, arythmia and as substitute for ACEI or AT1RB when general anesthesia is considered. Regarding the choice between ACEI and AT(1)RB, on the basis of indirect comparisons, we think that the latter may grant a comparable cardiac protection while giving a better cerebral protection. We shall have to wait the results of ONTARGET study to have or not the evidence for this preference. Finally, we want to stress the necessity to individualize the treatment by taking into account coexistence of cardiovascular complications and of other diseases, as well as the tolerance of the treatment (which may be influenced by seasons, in particular the canicula one), and the cost of the drugs.",

    "680": "We performed a retrospective analysis of the Minnesota Heart Survey, identifying patients hospitalized in 2000 in the Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area with heart failure. The main outcome measure was the association of ACE-I and ARB use on 30-day and 1-year mortality, stratified by glomerular filtration rate (GFR).", 
    "681": "Compared to patients with heart failure with preserved renal function (GFR > or = 90 mL/min), patients with severely impaired renal function (GFR <15 mL/min) were far less likely to receive ACE-I or ARB during hospitalization (52.0% vs 69.5%, P < .0001) or at discharge (50.5% vs 65.1%, P < .0001). Worsening renal function was associated with increased mortality, both at 30 days and at 1 year. The inhospital use of either an ACE-I or ARB was associated with significantly reduced 30-day mortality (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.59) after adjusting for multiple risk factors. Similarly, the discharge prescription of either an ACE-I or ARB was associated with a significant reduction in adjusted 1-year mortality (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.91). However, among patients on dialysis, there was no benefit of ACE-I or ARB on either 30-day or 1-year mortality.", 
    "682": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARB are underused in patients with heart failure with chronic kidney disease. Given the reduction in 30-day and 1-year mortality, these medications should be considered in most patients with heart failure, independent of underlying renal function. Among patients on hemodialysis, further investigation is warranted.", 
    "683": "The ACE-inhibitor lisinopril has previously been shown to be effective in migraine prophylaxis at a daily dose of 20 mg. To test the effect of a low dose of lisinopril (5 mg daily) in migraine prevention, we performed an open label study in 21 migraineurs. The primary outcome measure was frequency of migraine attacks. Secondary efficacy measures were migraine hours, intake of acute migraine drugs, pain intensity and responder rate. Compared with baseline conditions, the attack frequency of migraine attacks was significantly reduced (P < 0.0005). The number of acute migraine drugs dropped significantly (P = 0.002). Three patients dropped out because of intolerable cough. Our study suggests that even low doses of lisinopril may be effective in migraine treatment. However, its use may be limited by intolerable side-effects.", 
    "684": "As genetic tests for common gene variants and multifactorial, lifestyle-related conditions become available, it will be increasingly important to determine the psychological and behavioral impact of this emerging class of genetic tests. Our aim was to examine the potential impact of genetic testing for heart disease susceptibility on psychological predictors of smoking cessation. Two hundred and sixty-one smokers were asked to imagine that they had undergone a test for heart disease risk. They were randomly assigned to a genetic test scenario (low- or high-risk result) or an oxidative test scenario (high-risk result). Smokers in the genetic test-high risk group reported greater intention to quit smoking than smokers in the oxidative test-high risk group (p = 0.009); 30% of this was mediated by their holding stronger beliefs that quitting would reduce their heart disease risk (outcome expectations) (p = 0.011). The effect of genetic test-high risk feedback on outcome expectations was greatest amongst smokers with no heart disease family history (p = 0.038). The results suggest that genetic testing for heart disease risk may enhance interventions designed to improve health via increasing smoking cessation rates. Whether the findings hold true in studies that use real rather than hypothetical genetic tests remains to be seen.", 
    "685": "Activation of prorenin by (pro)renin receptor stimulates the tissue renin-angiotensin system and plays a significant role in the development of nephropathy in diabetic animals. This study examined whether (pro)renin receptor blockade inhibits the progression of nephropathy that has already developed in diabetic rats. Seventeen-week-old heminephrectomized streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with an increased urinary protein excretion and a significant glomerulosclerosis had been treated for 12 wk with the (pro)renin receptor blocker (PRRB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), or vehicle peptide by using subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. At the end of observation, in diabetic rats that were treated with vehicle, urinary protein excretion was progressively increased and a significant progression of glomerulosclerosis was observed. In diabetic rats that were treated with PRRB, however, no further increase in urinary protein excretion or glomerulosclerosis was observed, but 12-wk treatment with ACEi only attenuated further increases in urinary protein excretion and glomerulosclerosis. The enhanced expression of activated prorenin was observed in the kidneys of diabetic rats that were treated with vehicle, whereas it was markedly suppressed in the kidneys of diabetic rats that were treated with PRRB but not ACEi. These results suggest that (pro)renin receptor blockade does not only inhibit the progression of nephropathy but also reverses the glomerulosclerosis that has already developed in diabetic rats.",

Angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a rare but well known entity. Allergy to topical lignocaine has been acknowledged as a rare phenomenon when used for dental surgery and for skin anaesthesia, but it has not previously been reported after topical administration prior to nasendoscopy. In the reported case, our patient was unfortunate enough to be allergic to both lisinopril and lignocaine. The result was life-threatening airway obstruction, and the continued use of lignocaine spray sustained the laryngeal oedema.

This effect appears to be mediated in humans via the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor. The objective of this study was to evaluate, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the change in tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and PAI-1 plasma levels after treatment with an AT(1)-receptor blocker (losartan 50 mg/day) or an ACE inhibitor (delapril 60 mg/day).",

No patients had previously received ACE inhibitors or AT(1)-receptor blockers. After a 14-day run-in period with placebo, patients were randomised in a double-blind fashion into two groups: 15 patients were randomised to losartan 50 mg/day (group 1), 15 patients were randomised to delapril 60 mg/day (group 2), and 15 healthy subjects were used as controls (group 3).

Heart failure was induced by constriction of the abdominal aorta. All groups were further followed up for 12 weeks. Left ventricular myocytes were isolated. Cell-shortening fraction (FS) and intracellular calcium transients were measured at different frequency field stimulations. A negative force-frequency relationship (FFR) was found in the CHF-C group compared with the positive-negative biphasic FFR in the PS group, and a flat FFR in the CHF-T group. Intracellular Ca2+ frequency relationships (CaFRs) were positive-negative biphasic in both the PS and CHF-T groups, whereas a negative CaFR was found in the CHF-C group. Regardless of the stimulation frequency, FS significantly correlated with [Ca2+]imax in the PS or CHF-C groups.

In hypertensive patients, the dietary sodium intake should be limited to 65 mmol/day to 100 mmol/day. Other lifestyle modifications for both normotensive and hypertensive patients include: performing 30 min to 60 min of aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintaining a healthy body weight (body mass index of 18.5 kg/m2 to 24.9 kg/m2) and waist circumference (less than 102 cm in men and less than 88 cm in women); limiting alcohol consumption to no more than 14 units per week in men or nine units per week in women; following a diet reduced in saturated fat and cholesterol, and one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources; and considering stress management in selected individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should take into account each individual's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and any comorbid conditions: blood pressure should be lowered to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients and lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients require more than one agent to achieve these blood pressure targets. In adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics; other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (except in black patients), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). First-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension includes long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. Certain comorbid conditions provide compelling indications for first-line use of other agents: in patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction, or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor plus diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease). Selected high-risk patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy according to the position paper should nonetheless receive statin therapy.

Excised hearts were Langendorff-perfused to give equivalent coronary flow per gram heart weight. The left main coronary artery was occluded for 35 min followed by 120 min reperfusion. Infarct size was determined by tetrazolium staining. Heart size was assessed as left ventricle/body weight ratio (LV/BW). PC was effected with 2 x 5 min periods of global ischemia prior to coronary occlusion. Hearts were studied at 3-4 months (juvenile), 7-8 months (mature) or 12-13 months (aging). LV/BW ratio in SHR increased relative to WKY controls by 20%, 32% and 40% in juvenile, mature and aging hearts, respectively, but ischemic risk zone size was similar in all groups (52-59% of LV). PC was equally effective at limiting infarct size in juvenile and mature SHR and WKY hearts but was ineffective in aging hearts from both WKY and SHR. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors enhance sub-threshold PC in normal myocardium, we also examined the action of captopril (Cap) in aging hearts. Additional aging hearts received treatment with Cap 200 microM as an adjunct to PC. Although Cap+PC was able to induce modest protection in aging WKY hearts, this was not seen in aging SHR hearts. We conclude that PC is lost in longstanding hypertension through independent contributions of both hypertension and aging. These findings may have implications for the clinical development of preconditioning-based therapies since elderly patients with longstanding hypertension are at high risk of developing ischemic heart disease.",

However, those 74 patients randomized to amlodipine +/- perindopril had significant reductions in WCC (P = .005), with no significant changes in vWF or platelet count. Conversely, in those 85 patients randomized to atenolol +/- bendroflumethiazide, there were significant reductions in vWF (P = .001) and platelet count (P = .011) but no significant reductions in WCC.

Sympathetic and angiotensinergic systems were evaluated by acute hexamethonium and captopril administration; plasma and tissue (heart, kidney, and epididymal adipose tissue) angiotensins were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography; and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was determined by continuous fluorescent assay. Plasma renin activity and plasma levels of insulin and leptin were evaluated by radioimmunoassay.",

The sucrose group also showed a 27% higher renal sympathetic nervous activity. The depressor response to hexamethonium was similar in both groups, whereas captopril caused a more pronounced decrease in BP in the sucrose group than in controls (-40 +/- 2 v -11 +/- 2 mm Hg), possibly reflecting the higher plasma renin activity and plasma content of angiotensin II and renal angiotensin II in sucrose rats.",

Therapeutic response to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril used as add-on therapy to stable calcium channel blocker therapy with verapamil sustained release 240 mg was addressed in a racially/ethnically diverse group of 1,832 hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the association with a polymorphism (1166A-->C) in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene (AGTR1) was tested. BP response was compared between groups using analysis of covariance after adjustment for covariates associated with BP response. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing. Trandolapril decreased mean unadjusted systolic and diastolic BPs by -9.1 +/- 17.3 (SD) and -4.1 +/- 10.1 mm Hg, respectively. The percentage of patients with BP under control (<140/90 mm Hg) increased from 6.7% to 41.3% (p <0.0001). Adjusted BP response was significantly associated with age and baseline systolic and diastolic BP (p <0.0001). Whereas the decrease in systolic BP was more pronounced in younger patients, the opposite was observed for diastolic BP decrease. Diastolic BP response was also significantly associated with race. Specifically, the adjusted diastolic BP decrease was significantly smaller in Hispanics and blacks than whites (p = 0.0032 and p = 0.0069, respectively). However, Hispanics achieved a decrease in systolic BP and an increase in BP control similar to the other ethnic groups. There was no genetic association between AGTR1 1166A-->C genotype and BP response. In conclusion, trandolapril add-on therapy was effective in increasing BP control, with age and baseline BP associated with both systolic and diastolic BP response. Race was associated with diastolic BP response, although the difference is likely not to be clinically significant and AGTR1 genotype was not associated with BP response.",

In heparinized blood, plasma and rat liver, lung and intestinal homogenates, BIO1211 was converted rapidly to BIO1588 by hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal dipeptide moiety. This cleavage could be inhibited by EDTA and the ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat, the de-esterified acid derivative of enalapril. Enalaprilat inhibited the hydrolysis of BIO1211 in a concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) values of 2 nM in human and sheep plasma and 10 nM in rat plasma. In rat lung homogenate supernatant, the maximum inhibition of the conversion of BIO1211 to BIO1588 was approximately 80% at 1 microM with no further effect up to 100 microM of enalaprilat. Following a concomitant IV administration of enalapril and BIO1211 at 3 mg/kg each, the AUC and the half-life values of BIO1211 increased 18- and 10-fold, respectively. The AUC of BIO1588 decreased approximately 2-fold with no change in its plasma half-life.

    "771": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease that causes progressive expansion and rupture of the aorta with high mortality. There is a large and unmet need for nonsurgical treatment for AAA. Research has shown that an intricate network of inflammatory cells and interstitial cells contributes to the formation of AAA by producing pro-inflammatory mediators that activate enzymes to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and impair ECM biosynthesis. Pharmacological agents such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may promote tissue stabilization in AAA by diminishing pro-inflammatory signaling and normalizing metabolism of the ECM. Our recent experiments in animal models demonstrate that inhibition of c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) inhibits multiple pathological processes and causes regression of established AAA. Thus, emerging evidence indicates that pharmacological intervention targeting pro-inflammatory signaling and abnormal ECM metabolism is a promising strategy for treatment of AAA.",

Given its potential use in diabetic nephropathy, we sought to determine the effects of PKC-beta inhibition on VEGF and glomerular endothelial cells in experimental diabetic nephropathy. Studies were conducted in (mRen-2)27 rat, a transgenic rodent with hypertension and an enhanced renin-angiotensin system that following induction of diabetes with streptozotocin develops many of the features of diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, to mimic the clinical context, the effects of PKC-beta inhibition were examined both with and without concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Diabetic Ren-2 rats were randomized to receive either vehicle, the ACE inhibitor, perindopril (0.2 mg/l in drinking water), ruboxistaurin (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), admixed in chow), or their combination and studied for 12 wk. Diabetic Ren-2 rats displayed glomerular endothelial cell loss in association with overexpression of VEGF mRNA. Both cell loss and VEGF overexpression were attenuated by the administration of either perindopril or ruboxistaurin, as single agent treatments with their combination providing additional, incremental improvements, reducing these manifestations of injury down to levels seen in nondiabetic, normotensive, nontransgenic animals.

    "773": "The penetration of various viruses into host cells is accomplished by hijacking the host endocytosis machinery. In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, viral entry is reported to require a low pH in intracytoplasmic vesicles; however, little is known about how SARS-CoV invades such compartments. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway for its entry to target cells by using infectious SARS-CoV, as well as a SARS-CoV pseudovirus packaged in the SARS-CoV envelope. The SARS-CoV entered caveolin-1-negative HepG2 cells, and the entry was significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine, an inhibitor for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing for the clathrin heavy chain. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV entered COS7 cells transfected with the mutant of ACE2 with the cytoplasmic tail deleted, SARS-CoV receptor, as well as the wild-type ACE2, and their entries were significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine. In addition, ACE2 translocated into EEA1-positive early endosomes immediately after the virus attachment to ACE2. These results suggest that when SARS-CoV binds ACE2 it is internalized and penetrates early endosomes in a clathrin-dependent manner and that the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 is not required for the penetration of SARS-CoV.",

Effects of pre-inflammatory cytokines interferon (INF)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on expression of CX3CR1 and a single representative of each major chemokine family (CCR5 and CXCR4) were further assessed in three cell models: THP-1 monocytes, Jurkat T lymphocytes and primary monocytes isolated from healthy donors. Finally, effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, lisinopril and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan on chemokine receptor expression were evaluated in the same cell models either in a naive or stimulated state. INF-gamma significantly affected the chemokine receptor phenotype of THP-1 cells by increasing the rate of CX3CR1-positive cells. Pre-treatment with the ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril, and the ARB, losartan, did not influence these effects. Captopril and lisinopril similarly had no effect on either stimulated or naive primary monocytes. Yet, a small but repeatable increase in CX3CR1 expression after treatment with losartan was noted. Nevertheless, the latter observation did not retain statistical significance after applying the Bonferroni correction.

Adherence to ACC/AHA guidelines for non-ST-segment elevation ACS has improved over time but further improvement is needed. Failure to reduce the dose of a GP IIb/IIIa for patients with renal insufficiency resulting in excessive dosing of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors increases the risk of major bleeding and is particularly common among the elderly, women, and patients with renal insufficiency. The ACUITY study suggests that bivalirudin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is a suitable alternative to standard therapy for moderate- to high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS who are undergoing early invasive intervention, and bivalirudin alone may be preferred because of a lower risk of major bleeding. However, interpretation of the ACUITY results is complicated by numerous methodologic concerns, so the role of bivalirudin in managing non-ST-segment elevation ACS is still evolving. In patients with ST-segment elevation, clopidogrel provides an early benefit in reopening occluded coronary arteries and a late benefit in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity without increasing the risk of bleeding. Clopidogrel treatment is warranted before as well as after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation MI who receive fibrinolytic therapy.

However, because individual antihypertensive drugs seem not to differ largely in this respect, attention is drawn to the message that the most important task in these patients is to control total cardiovascular risk rather than focusing on the choice of the individual antihypertensive drug.", 
    "788": "The efficacy of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril in the treatment of hypertension, stable coronary artery disease, and heart failure is well established. The reduced stability of the current salt, perindopril-tert-butylamine, in extreme climatic conditions has prompted research into more stable compounds. This article presents stability and bioequivalence results for a new L-arginine salt of perindopril.", 
    "789": "Drug stability studies were performed on nonsalified perindopril, perindopril-tert-butylamine, and perindopril arginine in closed and open containers. The bioequivalence of perindopril arginine was tested in 36 healthy male volunteers in an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover pharmacokinetic study. A consumer study was carried out in 120 patients to assess preference for a simplified packaging using a high-density polyethylene canister designed for distribution to all climatic zones.", 
    "790": "Perindopril arginine is 50% more stable than perindopril-tert-butylamine, which increases the shelf life from 2 to 3 years. At the revised dosage (perindopril arginine 5-10 mg/day corresponds to perindopril-tert-butylamine 4-8 mg/day), the new salt is equivalent in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and acceptability. The consumer studies indicate a preference for the new packaging, with 62% of patients nominating the canister as better than the blister packs.", 
    "791": "The new perindopril arginine salt is equivalent to perindopril-tert-butylamine and more stable, and can be distributed to climatic zones III and IV without the need for specific packaging. The patient preference for the new packaging could have positive implications for compliance.", 
    "792": "Diabetes mellitus induces a decrease in sodium potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K(+)-ATPase) activity in several tissues in the rat and red blood cells (RBC) and nervous tissue in human patients. This decrease in Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity is thought to play a role in the development of long-term complications of the disease. Angiotensin enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (ARBs) reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of renal failure in patients with IDDM and diabetic rats. We investigated the effects of captopril and losartan, which are used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, on Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity. Captopril had an inhibitory effect on red cell plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase activity, but losartan did not. Our study draws attention to the inhibitory effect of captopril on Na+/K+ ATPase activity. Micro and macro vascular complications are preceeding mortality and morbidity causes in diabetes mellitus. There is a strong relationship between the decrease in Na+/K+ ATPase activity and hypertension. The non-sulphydryl containing ACEi and ARBs must be the choice of treatment in hypertensive diabetic patients and diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "793": "This study aimed to assess the blood pressure-lowering potency, renoprotective efficacy and safety of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor blocker irbesartan in monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or other antihypertensive medications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus switched from various antihypertensive pretreatments.", 
    "794": "Multicentre, open, prospective, 6-month observational study in 38 016 patients at 9838 general practitioners' offices throughout Germany. Microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetics was measured with semiquantitative immunological Micral-II urine dipstick tests.",

    "796": "The study population consisted of an equal number of males and females, mean body mass index was 28.4 kg/m(2), and mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was 7.2%. After the switch to irbesartan (in 86% of patients to the 300mg dosage in mono- or combination therapy), mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure was decreased by 23/12mm Hg. Irbesartan treatment over 6 months reduced the proportion of patients with microalbuminuria from 49.2 to 23.2% (relative reduction: 52.8%; p < 0.05) and the rate of patients with macroalbuminuria from 6.0 to 4.4% (relative reduction: 26.7%; p < 0.05). The renoprotective effect of irbesartan was consistent in various subgroups (analyses by sex, weight, diabetes duration, insulin treatment, strength of blood pressure-lowering effect, and antihypertensive pretreatment). Tolerability was excellent: 99.6% of patients remained free of any adverse events during the study.", 
    "797": "The profound blood pressure-lowering and renoprotective effect of irbesartan in type 2 diabetes documented in clinical endpoint studies was confirmed in second-line therapy in a large sample of primary-care patients. Furthermore, in patients switched from previous ACE-inhibitor therapy, the renoprotective effect of irbesartan was of the same magnitude as in the total cohort.", 
    "798": "Lack of prolidase I (PD I) leads to prolidase deficiency, a disease characterized by intractable skin lesions, recurrent respiratory infections, and mental retardation. The present study was undertaken to characterize and determine the physiologic roles of different prolidase isoenzymes. Two isoforms of prolidase were isolated from rat kidney. PD I showed higher activity against seryl-proline and alanyl-proline, whereas PD II was active especially against methionyl-proline. PD I was highly concentrated in the small intestine and kidney, whereas PD II was shown not to vary in the organs examined. Expression of PD I and PD II in the small intestine were maximal within 1 wk of birth, and then rapidly declined. The changes of prolidase in the kidney and heart were found to differ slightly. N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-proline and captopril inhibited PD I dose-dependently, but showed no inhibition of PD II at low concentrations. NiCl2 inhibited PD II much more effectively than PD I. Our findings suggest that PD I functions by way of an intestinal peptide carrier, which may also be regulated by the uptake of various iminodipeptides. Similarly, age-related alterations of prolidase isoenzymes suggest that intestinal PD II also participates in absorption of proline and other amino acids early in life.", 
    "799": "The present experiments were performed in beta1/beta2-adrenergic receptor-deficient mice (beta1/beta2ADR(-/-)) to assess the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in basal and regulated renin expression and release. On a control diet, plasma renin concentration (in ng angiotensin I per mL per hour), determined in tail vein blood, was significantly lower in beta1/beta2ADR(-/-) than in wild-type (WT) mice (222+/-65 versus 1456+/-335; P<0.01). Renin content and mRNA were 77% and 65+/-5% of WT. Plasma aldosterone (in picograms per mL) was also significantly reduced (420+/-36 in beta1/beta2ADR(-/-) versus 692+/-59 in WT). A low-salt diet (0.03%) for 1 week increased plasma renin concentration significantly in both beta1/beta2ADR(-/-) and WT mice (to 733+/-54 and 2789+/-555), whereas a high-salt diet (8%) suppressed it in both genotypes (to 85+/-24 in beta1/beta2ADR(-/-) and to 676+/-213 in WT). The absolute magnitude of salt-induced changes of plasma renin concentration was markedly greater in WT mice. Acute stimulation of renin release by furosemide, quinaprilat, captopril, or candesartan caused significant increases of plasma renin concentration in both beta1/beta2ADR(-/-) and WT mice, but again the absolute changes were greater in WT mice. We conclude that maintenance of normal levels of renin synthesis and release requires tonic beta-adrenergic receptor activation. In the chronic absence of beta-adrenergic receptor input, the size of the releasable renin pool decreases with a concomitant reduction in the magnitude of the plasma renin concentration changes caused by variations of salt intake or acute stimulation with furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme, or angiotensin type 1 receptor inhibition, but regulatory responsiveness is nonetheless maintained.", 
    "800": "This European Community Biomedicine and Health Research-supported, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial investigated the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) in children and young people with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), moderate proteinuria (>1 and <3.5 g/d per 1.73 m(2)) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) >50 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Sixty-six patients who were 20.5 yr of age (range 9 to 35 yr), were randomly assigned to Benazepril 0.2 mg/kg per d (ACE-I) or placebo and were followed for a median of 38 mo. The primary outcome was the progression of kidney disease, defined as >30% decrease of CrCl; secondary outcomes were (1) a composite end point of >30% decrease of CrCl or worsening of proteinuria until > or =3.5 g/d per 1.73 m(2) and (2) proteinuria partial remission (<0.5 g/d per 1.73 m(2)) or total remission (<160 mg/d per 1.73 m(2)) for >6 mo. Analysis was by intention to treat. A single patient (3.1%) in the ACE-I group and five (14.7%) in the placebo group showed a worsening of CrCl >30%. The composite end point of >30% decrease of CrCl or worsening of proteinuria until nephrotic range was reached by one (3.1%) of 32 patients in the ACE-I group, and nine (26.5%) of 34 in the placebo group; the difference was significant (log-rank P = 0.035). A stable, partial remission of proteinuria was observed in 13 (40.6%) of 32 patients in the ACE-I group versus three (8.8%) of 34 in the placebo group (log-rank P = 0.033), with total remission in 12.5% of ACE-I-treated patients and in none in the placebo group (log-rank P = 0.029). The multivariate Cox analysis showed that treatment with ACE-I was the independent predictor of prognosis; no influence on the composite end point was found for gender, age, baseline CrCl, systolic or diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, or proteinuria.", 
    "801": "Monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been shown to be beneficial in suppressing the progression of experimentally induced kidney diseases. Whether such therapy provides additional benefits when combined with vitamin D or an analog of vitamin D has not been established. Rats were made uremic by 5/6 nephrectomy and treated as follows: Uremic + vehicle (UC), uremic + enalapril (30 mg/L in drinking water; E), uremic + paricalcitol (19-nor; 0.8 microg/kg, three times a week), and uremic + enalapril + paricalcitol (E + 19-nor). A group of normal rats served as control (NC). BP was significantly elevated in the UC and 19-nor groups compared with the NC group but was indistinguishable from normal in the E and E + 19-nor groups. The decrease in creatinine clearance and the increase in the excretion of urinary protein that were observed in the UC group were ameliorated by the use of E alone or by E + 19-nor (P < 0.05 versus UC). The glomerulosclerotic index was significantly decreased in both the 19-nor (P < 0.01) and E + 19-nor groups (P < 0.01) compared with the UC group. Tubulointerstitial volume was significantly decreased in both the E (P < 0.05) and E + 19-nor groups (P < 0.01) compared with the UC group. Both macrophage infiltration (ED-1-positive cells) and production of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were significantly blunted in E + 19-nor compared with E group. TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein expression were increased in the UC group (mRNA: 23.7-fold; protein: 29.1-fold versus NC). These increases were significantly blunted in the 19-nor group (mRNA: 7.1-fold; protein: 8.0-fold versus NC) and virtually normalized in the E + 19-nor group (protein: 0.8-fold versus NC). Phosphorylation of Smad2 was also elevated in the UC group (7.6-fold versus NC) but less so in the 19-nor-treated rats (5.5-fold versus NC). When rats were treated with E + 19-nor, the phosphorylation of Smad2 was normal (1.1-fold versus NC). Thus, 19-nor can suppress the progression of renal insufficiency via mediation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, and this effect is amplified when BP is controlled via renin-angiotensin system blockade.",

Forty-four plants belonging to 30 families were investigated. Plants were selected based on their popular use as antihypertensive and/or diuretics.

    "803": "We measured angiotensin-converting enzyme and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activities after myocardial infarction in hamsters and compared the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril with those of an angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan cilexetil after myocardial infarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was significantly increased 3 and 7 days, but not 1 day after myocardial infarction. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was significantly increased 1 day after myocardial infarction. Lisinopril significantly inhibited both angiotensin-converting enzyme and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activities, but candesartan cilexetil did not. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might directly inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity.", 
    "804": "Atherothrombosis is a progressive and generalized pathologic process that affects the vascular system. Clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis depend on the affected vascular bed and include acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Ischemia associated with atherothrombosis is highly prevalent, affecting millions of people each year. Many patients experience multiple ischemic events within the first year of an initial event. The mainstay for prevention includes risk factor management through lifestyle modification and treatment of underlying disease. Guidelines have been published for secondary prevention of atherothrombosis-related cardiovascular disease, including use of various long-term pharmacotherapies, such as antiplatelet agents, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Implementation of effective treatment strategies requires an awareness of the guidelines by physicians to ensure that both acute therapy and long-term management are addressed. This review is based on treatment guidelines and selected peer-reviewed publications identified through a MEDLINE and PubMed literature search, primarily from January 1996 to December 2006, that relate to clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy in patients with atherothrombotic disease. Secondary prevention strategies for patients with atherothrombosis are discussed, highlighting current guideline recommendations and programs designed to encourage a continuum of care from the acute to the ambulatory setting.", 
    "805": "Lack of specific and efficient therapy leads to the high mortality rate of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS). Recent evidence implies that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI. Pharmaceutical inhibitors of ACE have been used clinically for hypertension but not for ALI/ARDS yet. The objective was to study the effects of ACE inhibition with captopril on severe lung injury induced by oleic acid (OA) in rats. Oleic acid was intravenously injected into Sprague Dawley rats, followed by i.p. administration of captopril or saline control. Lung injury, endothelium damage and related molecules, and disturbance of coagulation were examined in comparison between the treated and the nontreated groups. An OA-induced ALI was featured with thickening of the alveolar septa, alveolar hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Comparing with the nontreated OA group, the administration of captopril prevented the rats from OA-induced severe lungs injury, with a significantly lower lung injury score, less albumin content and infiltrated cells in the alveoli, decreased wet/dry weight ratio of the lung tissues, and improved lung function (PaO2 per fraction of inspired oxygen). Captopril also dramatically reduced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the lung tissue and in the circulating endothelial cells in the blood, indicating a protective effect on endothelial cells activation/damage. Moreover, captopril treatment led to a blockage of nuclear factor kappaB activation in lung tissues and to the recovery of the fibrinolytic disturbance. Thus, our data suggest that the inhibition of ACE with its clinically used inhibitor offers protective effects on ALI/ARDS, implying the potential for therapeutic option.",

Multiple linear regression was used to model DeltaLVM from baseline study. Cox proportional analysis was used to determine risk factors associated with either de novo LVH or>20% DeltaLVMI over time.", 
    "808": "Patients with baseline LVH (n=37; 61%) had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those without LVH (n=23; 39%) (P=0.013). BMI, haemoglobin levels (P=0.047) and non-use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (P=0.057) were associated with baseline left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Twelve out of 23 patients (52%) with normal LVM at baseline, developed either de novo LVH or>20% DeltaLVMI at follow-up. On the other hand, 29 (78%) of those with initial LVH maintained this abnormality, and 8 (22%) normalized LVM post-transplantation. Factors associated with DeltaLVMI were age (P=0.01), pre-dialysis LVMI (P<0.0001), serum creatinine (P=0.012) and the use of ACEI post-transplantation (P=0.009). In Cox analysis, pre-dialysis LVMI was associated with de novo LVH or>20% DeltaLVMI over time (hazard ratio 1.009; 95% confidence interval 1.004 to 1.015; P=0.001).",

    "810": "With the rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes worldwide, including the United States, the death and disability due to the suboptimal control of cardiovascular disease associated with this epidemic has made prevention of type 2 diabetes emerge as a primary strategic intervention. Several modalities have been assessed in large randomized controlled trials for diabetes prevention such as lifestyle interventions and various pharmacologic agents. Included in these agents are metformin, thiazolidinediones, acarbose, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as angiotensin receptor blockers. Abrogation of oxidative stress appears to be a common soil hypothesis that explains the favorable effects of these agents on glucose metabolism, including the prevention of diabetes and its complications. This comprehensive review highlights the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of diabetes, with emphasis on the major clinical trials conducted on prevention of type 2 diabetes.",

This study examined all of the 2,100 substitutable drugs in Finland. The impact of generic substitution on price competition was significant. The average price of substitutable drugs decreased by more than 10%. However, the price development was uneven; some prices increased whereas others decreased by more than 50%. The most important factors that influenced the price development were the number of competitors, whether the drug was originator or generic and the width of the price band.", 
    "812": "The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) Na+-Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC), the target of thiazide diuretics, is responsible for the reabsorption of 5-10% of filtered NaCl. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that acute infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (at 12 microg/min) for 20 min provokes trafficking of NCC from apical plasma membranes (APM) to subapical cytoplasmic vesicles (SCV), which is reversed by acute ANG II infusion (ANG II at 20 ng.kg(-1).min(-1) along with 12 microg/min captopril) for 20 min in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g). By immuno-electron microscopy using an anti-NCC (D. Ellison) 71.5 +/- SD 4.9% of the NCC gold labeling was associated with the APM in control, sham operated, and infused rats, while captopril infusion reduced NCC in APM to 54.9 +/- 6.9% (P < 0.001) and markedly increased immunogold labeling of SCV. Subsequent infusion of ANG II with captopril restored NCC immunogold labeling of APM to 72.4 +/- 4.2%, that is, 20% of the total NCC trafficked between APM and SCV. Likewise, on density gradients of cortex, captopril provoked redistribution of 27.3% of total NCC from low-density APM-enriched membranes to higher-density membranes and ANG II+captopril restored 20.3% of the NCC to APM-enriched fractions. Redistribution occurred independent of a change in NCC total abundance. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ACE inhibition provokes acute trafficking of NCC out of the plasma membrane, which likely decreases DCT Na+ reabsorption, while ANG II provokes rapid trafficking of NCC from stores in subapical vesicles to the plasma membrane, which likely increases DCT Na+ reabsorption.", 
    "813": "In aortic stenosis (AS), adverse remodelling of the valves may depend on altered local regulation of pro- and antifibrotic systems. We have recently shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which generates profibrotic angiotensin II and inactivates antifibrotic bradykinin (BK), is upregulated in stenotic aortic valves. Here, we analyse the expression of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), another profibrotic and BK-degrading enzyme, and of BK receptors in aortic valves in AS.", 
    "814": "Stenotic aortic valves (n = 86) were obtained at valve replacement surgery and control valves (n = 13) at cardiac transplantation. Expression levels of NEP and BK type 1 and 2 receptors (BK-1R and BK-2R) in aortic valves and in isolated valvular myofibroblasts were analysed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, and NEP activity was quantified by autoradiography. NEP, BK-1R, and BK-2R mRNA levels were higher in stenotic than in non-stenotic valves (P < 0.05 for each) and the respective proteins localized to valvular endothelial cells and myofibroblasts. In stenotic valves, the proteolytic activity of NEP was significantly increased (4.5-fold, P < 0.001), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha induced the expression of NEP in cultured myofibroblasts. Finally, treatment of cultured myofibroblasts with an NEP inhibitor (phosphoramidon) downregulated the expression of profibrotic transforming growth factor-beta1, whereas addition of BK decreased the expression of collagens I and III which was reversed by a BK-2R antagonist.", 
    "815": "NEP activity is increased in stenotic aortic valves in parallel with increased expression of BK-receptors. The upregulation of NEP and BK-1R have the potential to promote valvular fibrosis and remodelling while the increase in BK-2R may represent a compensatory antifibrotic response. These findings add novel pathogenic insight and raise potential new therapeutic targets in AS.",

    "820": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent one of the most commonly used categories of drugs in canine and feline medicine. ACE inhibitors currently approved for use in veterinary medicine are benazepril, enalapril, imidapril and ramipril. They are all pro-drugs administered by oral route. A physiologically based model taking into account the saturable binding to ACE has been developed for pharmacokinetic analysis. The bioavailability of the active compounds from their respective pro-drug is low. The active metabolites are eliminated by renal, hepatorenal or biliary excretion, according to the drug. The elimination half-life of the free fraction of the active compounds is very short (ranging from approximately 10 min to 2 h). ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated. Benazepril, enalapril, imidapril and ramipril are approved for dogs with chronic heart failure (CHF). The efficacy of ACE inhibitors has been convincingly demonstrated in dogs with CHF, especially in those with chronic valvular disease. In such clinical settings, ACE inhibitors improve hemodynamics and clinical signs, and increase survival time. In cats with cardiovascular disease, little information is available except for reports of some benefit in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two non-controlled investigations. ACE inhibitors have also a mild to moderate hypotensive effect. There is also evidence to recommend ACE inhibitors in dogs and cats with chronic renal failure (CRF). They decrease the glomerular capillary pressure, have antiproteinuric effects, tend to delay the progression of CRF and to limit the extent of renal lesions.", 
    "821": "Beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) blockers in patients with cardiovascular and renal diseases have been clearly demonstrated in numerous large outcomes studies. In patients with heart failure (HF), ACEI have been shown to reduce overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular causes, to increase life expectancy, as well as to preserve the renal function (CONSENSUS, SAVE, TRACE, AIRE, AIREX, CATS trials). In addition, in the PROGRESS study ACEI substantially decreased the risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with cerebrovascular disorders. The HOPE and EUROPA studies confirmed that long term therapy with ACEI provides significant survival benefit in patients with broad range of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. After these large and well designed clinical studies, ACEI have become standard therapy for routine secondary prevention in all patients with cardiovascular diseases, unless contraindicated. AT1 receptor blockers have been recently added to the cardiovascular therapeutic armamentarium. They are believed to provide additional protection by inhibition of locally synthesized angiotensin II on the level of AT1 receptor. The ELITE II, ValHeFT and CHARM studies have shown that AT1 receptor blockers are equally effective as ACEI in reduction of mortality and morbidity in patients with HF. Importantly, they may be used together with ACEI, or as alternative treatment in ACEI intolerant patients. Renal protection is another important effect of both ACEI and AT1 blockers that has been confirmed in several large clinical trials. The North American Microalbuminemia Study group and EUCLID group demonstrated significant reduction in progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) treated with ACEI. AT1 receptor blockers are mainly studied in the non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) nephropathy. Four recent clinical trials (IRMA-2, DETAIL, RENAAL and IDNT) examined the effect of AT1 receptor blockers in patients with NIDDM nephropathy. These studies confirmed the beneficial effect of AT1 receptor blockers in patients with NIDDM nephropathy that was extended beyond the blood pressure reduction. Ongoing studies (ONTARGET, TRANSCEND and PROTECTION) should provide us with additional insights about cardiovascular, renal and other end-organ protective effects of these therapeutics.", 
    "822": "Monocrotaline (MCT), a pyrrolizidine alkaloid extracted from the shrub Crotalaria spectabilis, induces in the lungs of many mammalian species severe hypertension and fibrosis. Previous work with MCT-induced lung disease in rats has shown that some of the steps to progressive fibrosis can be interrupted or decreased by intervention with retinoic acid (RA) or with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. This report emphasizes the pathology and cytokines present in lungs of rats in the MCT model of hypertension and fibrosis in 8 treatment groups, six per group: (1) controls, not treated; (2) captopril; (3) RA; (4) combined captopril and RA. Groups 5-8 replicated groups 1-4 and also received MCT subcutaneously. Tissues were harvested at 28 days for histopathology and measurement of cytokines TGFbeta, TNFalpha, interleukin 6, and IFN_. TGFbeta was depressed at 28 days by MCT, an effect reversed by a combination of captopril and RA. RA influences production of an important Th1 cytokine, IFN_, and demonstrated the greatest limitation of MCT-induced TNFalpha. The MCT-induced lung pathology of vasculitis, interstitial pneumonia and fibrosis was limited by captopril. Smooth muscle actin was overexpressed in MCT treated animals receiving RA, an effect reduced with captopril. Overall, the study confirmed the existence of a protective effect for both captopril and RA from MCT-induced lung damage at 30 days. No synergistic or antagonistic activity was observed when the two drugs were administered together. Each of the drugs exerts different and particular effects on serum and tissue levels of various cytokines, suggesting that each drug is efficient at different points of attack in the control of lung fibrosis.", 
    "823": "Radiation nephropathy has emerged as a significant complication of bone marrow transplantation and radionuclide radiotherapy, and is a potential sequela of radiological terrorism and radiation accidents. In the early 1990's, it was demonstrated that experimental radiation nephropathy could be treated with a thiol-containing ACE inhibitor, captopril. Further studies have shown that enalapril (a non-thiol ACE inhibitor) is also effective in the treatment of experimental radiation nephropathy, as are both AII type-1 (AT(1)) and type-2 (AT(2)) receptor antagonists. ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists are also effective in the mitigation (prevention) of radiation nephropathy. Other types of antihypertensive drugs are ineffective in mitigation, but brief use of a high-salt diet in the immediate post-irradiation period significantly decreases renal injury. There are differences between mitigation and treatment of radiation nephropathy that imply that different mechanisms are operating. First, a high-salt diet is effective in the mitigation of radiation nephropathy, but deleterious on the treatment of established disease. Second, AT(1) blockade is more effective than ACE inhibition for mitigation of radiation nephropathy, but equally effective for treatment. Third, the efficacy of AT(1) blockade and ACE inhibition is highly dependent on drug dose in mitigation of radiation nephropathy, but not so in treatment. Finally, while AT(2) blockade augments the benefit of AT(1) blockade in mitigation of radiation nephropathy, it does not do so in treatment. We hypothesize that while mitigation of radiation nephropathy works by suppression of the renin-angiotensin system, treatment of established radiation nephropathy requires blood pressure control in addition to (or possibly instead of) suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.",

When applied to lungs, it leads to a complication described as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and eventually to organ fibrosis. For its high mortality, the condition precludes treatment with high doses of radiation. There is widespread interest to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms of IPS and to find drugs effective in the prevention of its development. This report summarizes our experience with the protective effects of L 158,809, an angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor blocker, and two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the development of IPS and the role of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and of alpha-actomyosin (alpha SMA) in pathogenesis of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis in an experimental model of bone marrow transplant (BMT). Male WAG/Riji/MCV rats received total body irradiation and a regimen of cyclophosphamide (CTX) in preparation for bone marrow transplant. While one group of animals remained untreated, the remainders were subdivided into three groups, each of them receiving either the ANG II receptor blocker or one of the two ACE inhibitors (Captopril or Enalapril). Each of the three drugs was administered orally from 11 days before the transplant up to 56 days post transplant. At sacrifice time the irradiated rats receiving only CTX showed a chronic pneumonitis with septal fibrosis and vasculitis affecting, in particular, small caliber pulmonary arteries and arterioles. Their lung content of hydroxyproline was also markedly elevated in association with the lung concentrations of thromboxane (TXA2) and prostaglandin (PGI(2)), (two markers of pulmonary endothelial damage). A significant increase of alpha actomyosin staining was observed in vessels, septa and macrophages of the same animals which also overexpressed TGF-beta. When L 158,809, Captopril and Enalapril were added to the radiation and cytoxan treatment, a significant amelioration of the histological damage as well as the overexpression of alpha SMA was observed. Lung concentrations of hydroxyproline, PGI(2), TXA2 and TGF-beta were also observed in these animals so that the values of these compounds were closer to those measured in untreated control rats than to their irradiated and cytoxan treated counterparts. Angiotensin II plays an important role in the regulation of TGF-beta and alpha SMA, two proteins involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. The finding that ACE inhibitors or ANG II receptor blockers protect the lungs from radiation induced pneumonitis and fibrosis reaffirms the role that ANG II plays in this inflammatory process and suggests an additional indication of treatment of this condition, thus opening a new potential pharmacologic use of these drugs.", 
    "825": "The renin-angiotensin system is primarily responsible for regulating vascular tone. Drugs that inhibit this pathway, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists, are widely used to treat hypertension and a variety of cardiomyopathies. Recent studies have shown that, in addition to reducing blood pressure, these drugs also modulate inflammation, adhesion molecule expression, and fibrosis. To assess the therapeutic potential of these inhibitory agents for the treatment of inflammatory heart disease, the drugs have been tested in experimental models of infectious and autoimmune myocarditis. This review summarizes the results of studies examining the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists for the treatment of mouse models of virus-induced and parasite-induced myocarditis, as well as autoimmune cardiomyopathy. The collective results strongly support the use of renin-angiotensin modulation for the treatment of myocarditis. Importantly, this therapeutic approach seems to downregulate autoimmunity without causing immune suppression which may enhance the survival of the disease-initiating infectious agent.",

Patients were prospectively identified through a multidisciplinary intervention led by a nurse manager, and their records were input retrospectively into the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines patient management tool. The association's program, which recommends initiating 4 cardioprotective drug classes while patients are hospitalized, was started 2 years into the observation period (August 2000). Treatment rates were compared over the ensuing years. We evaluated temporal trends in discharge use of 4 drugs: (1) betablockers, (2) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), (3) hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), and (4) aspirin. We calculated the proportion of eligible patients (no documented contraindication) who were prescribed each drug category as well as the proportion who received all 4 drug categories, our principal composite outcome.

ABPM was performed at baseline and at the end of the 12-week treatment period in 112 patients (imidapril group, n=55; candesartan cilexetil group, n=57). To achieve the target BP of <or=140/90 mm Hg, imidapril was titrated from 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and candesartan cilexetil was titrated from 4 mg/day to 16 mg/day.",

In addition, significant and similar reductions in DBP and SBP were observed during the early morning acceleration period in both treatments. The reduction in BP load was higher with imidapril than with candesartan cilexetil: 44.6% versus 34.5% reduction in DBP load and 38.0% versus 32.9% reduction in SBP load, respectively. With respect to the average deviation index expressing a load index, the reduction with imidapril was 41.0% versus 33.6% with candesartan cilexetil. The percentage of DBP dipper patients remained identical before and after treatment in both groups. With regard to SBP, the percentage of dippers increased from 38.2% to 45.5% in the imidapril group and decreased from 54.4% to 42.1% in the candesartan cilexetil group. The incidence of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups and no cases of dry cough were reported.", 
    "834": "Imidapril in once-daily doses of up to 20mg was shown to be at least as effective as candesartan cilexetil given in once-daily doses of up to 16 mg in reducing BP throughout the entire 24-hour dosing interval. Both drugs were well tolerated.", 
    "835": "Although many data indicate that the management of hypertension has improved over the last two decades, there is still a large proportion of hypertensive individuals who do not receive adequate management of their blood pressure (BP). Combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive agents from different drug classes is increasingly being recognised as the most effective means of achieving target BP values by pharmacological means, particularly in the large number of patients in whom monotherapy proves to be ineffective. Use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor combined with a diuretic is a well established antihypertensive combination that is very effective because of the different, yet synergistic, mechanisms of actions of agents from these two drug classes. Delapril is a potent antihypertensive ACE inhibitor, and indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic with additional antihypertensive properties. The combination of delapril and indapamide provides renoprotective effects, and indapamide is also cardioprotective. Use of these two drugs together is therefore a rational selection for combination therapy, and one that has consistently demonstrated lowering of BP to target values with a level of efficacy that is at least as good as other combinations of ACE inhibitors and diuretics. This combination has also been found to provide favourable effects on haemodynamic parameters, including left ventricular mass index and ejection fraction. Furthermore, combining an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide-type diuretic has been associated with a decreased risk of stroke and is recommended for patients with cerebrovascular disease, a setting in which the combination of delapril and indapamide has therapeutic potential. Because of the additive mechanisms of delapril and indapamide, the dose required for an effective antihypertensive effect is relatively low, and the combination is well tolerated at such doses. In particular, metabolic effects normally associated with diuretics are rare at the therapeutic dose of indapamide used in combination with delapril, making the combination suitable for patients with metabolic disorders in whom diuretic therapy would otherwise not be recommended. Delapril 30 mg and indapamide 2.5mg have been combined in a fixed combination, offering the convenience of a one-tablet-per-day antihypertensive drug regimen for most patients, which, along with good tolerability, helps to address the issue of noncompliance.",

    "837": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a leading cause of mortality in the world, mainly on account of cardiovascular diseases. At present we know that not only DM but also other hyperglycemic states are a risk factor for coronary arterial disease. In the context of acute coronary syndromes, DM determines a worst prognosis, either in short- or long-term outcomes. Since the absolute risk of death is greater among diabetic patients when compared to non-diabetic patients, therapeutical interventions have a greater impact in terms of benefits to these patients as well. Strategies such as strict control of hyperglycemia during hospitalization, acute reperfusion management (either by thrombolysis or by percutaneous coronary intervention), use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors have recently proven to be of greater benefit for diabetics over non-diabetic patients. Meanwhile, in spite of all proven benefits of the use of evidence-based interventions to the treatment of acute coronary syndromes on diabetic patients, there is still an under utilization of these measures. Therefore, taking into account the predictions of an increasing number of diabetics in the world for the future years, and the fact that acute coronary syndromes will be the leading cause of death among them, it becomes increasingly necessary for both cardiologists and endocrinologists to work together in order to reduce the unfavorable outcomes that are expected to arise.", 
    "838": "The neuropathic complications related to Diabetes may affect the somatic, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. As a result, there are several clinical manifestations of diabetic neuropathy. They can be related to nervous system lesions of the genital, urinary, gastro-intestinal, skin and cardiovascular tissues. The results of these alterations are loss in the quality of life as well as increase of mortality indexes related to sudden death with cardiac arrhythmias and other causes. The cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy probably contributes to the bad prognosis of the coronary heart disease and of the heart failure in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. For diabetologists, the nervous complications of diabetes are the result of an increase influx of glucose to the neuronal and endothelial cells. Evidences show that, with the aim of preventing these complications, the diabetic patients should receive a precocious diagnosis and be instructed for having a good metabolic and blood pressure control. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta adrenergic blockers are probably of impact in the prevention of the cardiac autonomic complications of diabetes.", 
    "839": "The implication of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of the cardiovascular system has been well known for many years. Accordingly, many pharmaceutical inhibitors have been developed to treat several pathologies, like hypertension and heart failure, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) became one of the major target in the treatment of these cardiovascular diseases. In the last decade however, it has become apparent that the classical view of the RAS was not quite accurate. For instance, ACE has been shown to work not only by generating angiotensin-II but also by interacting with receptors outside the renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, it has been shown that many local RAS are present in different tissues, such as the heart, brain, kidney and vasculature. However, in the past, it was impossible to determine the role of these local systems as they were pharmacologically indistinguishable from the systemic RAS. Hence, in recent years, the development of transgenic animals has allowed us to determine that these local systems are implicated in the roles that had been originally attributed exclusively to the systemic action of the RAS. However, with almost 30% of the medicated hypertensive patients harboring an uncontrolled blood pressure, a need for new drugs and new targets appears necessary. With the new century came the discovery of a new homolog of ACE, called ACE2, and early studies suggest that it may play a pivotal role in the RAS by controlling the balance between the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin-II and the vasodilatory properties of the angiotensin(1-7) peptide. Like ACE, ACE2 appears to hydrolyze peptides not related with the RAS and the enzyme has also been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Although the tissue localization of ACE2 was originally though to be very restricted, new studies have emerged showing a more widespread distribution. Therefore, the whole dynamics of the RAS has to be re-evaluated in light of this new information. In this review, we will compare the structures, distributions and properties of ACE and its new homologue in the context of cardiovascular function, focusing on the autocrine/paracrine cardiac and brain renin-angiotensin systems and we will present recent data from the literature and our laboratory offering a new perspective on this potential target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "840": "Decades of experimentation on angiotensin and bradykinin have focused on macrovascular systemic effects. However, angiotensin II and bradykinin are both angiogenic agents, highlighting their ability to also effect the microvascular circulation. Not surprisingly, inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, which inhibits angiotensin II synthesis and bradykinin degradation, would have different impacts on angiogenesis in vivo dependent upon what factors were present in the system. Several pathological states in which angiogenesis is important, including peripheral ischemia, stroke, retinopathy, and cancer are examined in this review with respect to activity of angiotensin II and bradykinin and the impact of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Although generalizations are not without legitimate criticism, one can think about peripheral ischemia and stroke as being more dependent upon bradykinin signaling and retinopathy and cancer as more dependent upon angiotensin II signaling to drive angiogenesis. Many exceptions are found that are specific to individual animal model systems. Furthermore, cancer systems that have been examined at any depth are few. However, published data on in vitro cultures and animal models present interesting predictions about how the renin angiotensin and bradykinin systems may function in humans. Since angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been widely utilized pharmaceuticals for many years, we are now accumulating epidemiological data that test our predictions. The importance of understanding which agent, angiotensin and/or bradykinin, appears to be the more important regulator of angiogenesis in a given pathology will become increasing evident as more specific angiotensin II and bradykinin receptor blocking drugs make their way into clinical use.", 
    "841": "Effective blood pressure control with a large arsenal of conventional antihypertensive drugs, such as diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, and calcium channel blockers, significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. However, blood pressure control with these drugs does not reduce cardiovascular disease risks to the levels in normotensive persons. Only two drug classes that inhibit or antagonize portions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor type-1 (AT(1) receptor) blockers, have protective and beneficial effects unrelated to the degree of blood pressure reduction. These drugs may prevent the blood pressure related functional and structural abnormalities of the cardiovascular system and reduce the end organ-damage. The first part of this review presents the components of the RAS, biological actions of angiotensin peptides, and the functions of the enzymes that generate and metabolize angiotensins, including the likely effect of manipulating them. Special attention is devoted to renin, ACE, ACE2, chymase, and neprilysin. The second part of this review presents the rationale for targeting the RAS, based on clinical studies of the ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor blockers. Finally, we present the investigational agents acting on the RAS that have a potential for clinical usage, and give the perspective of pharmacological, immunological and gene targeting of the RAS for treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

EDs are relatively new phenomena that are presumed to contribute to vasoregulatory malfunctions at the small-vessel level. Ever more clinical observations indicate that the above genetic variants are also associated with cerebral small-vessel disorders. This article reviews the knowledge available on the roles of ED- associated genetic variants in cerebral circulatory disorders, and suggests that EDs can be causative factors for different common cerebral pathologies such as leukoaraiosis or/and small-vessel infarcts. Newly-developed drugs involving phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, which improve the endothelial functions, may comprise a new approach to the treatment and prevention of small-vessel cerebral circulatory disorders.",

It has been suggested that clinical usage of pattern (Zheng) diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine may improve the accuracy in selecting the right antihypertensive agents with improved efficacy and deceased adverse effects. Limited research in this area suggested the calcium channel blocker may work better in treating phlegmatic damp excess pattern and blood stasis pattern while beta-blockers may be more beneficial in the liver yang rising pattern. On the other hand, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be more suitable in a yin deficiency and yang hyperactivity pattern as well as combined liver and kidney yin deficiency pattern. More research studies using this innovative approach in improving the selection of antihypertensive agents including mechanistic studies are urgently needed.",

    "886": "Liver allograft recipients are at increased risk of death from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. We propose the following strategy of risk-reduction, based on currently available literature. Lifestyle: standard advice should be given (avoidance of smoking, excess alcohol and obesity, adequate exercise, reduction of excess sodium intake). Hypertension: target blood pressure should be 140/90 mmHg or lower, but for those with diabetes or renal disease, 130/80 mmHg or lower. For patients without proteinuria, antihypertensive therapy should be initiated with a calcium channel blocker and for those with proteinuria, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker. If monotherapy fails to achieve adequate response, calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be combined. If hypertension remains uncontrolled, an alpha-blocker may be added. Consideration should be given to changing immunosuppression and avoiding use of calcineurin inhibitors. Diabetes: recipients should be regularly screened for diabetes. For patients with new-onset diabetes after transplant, stepwise therapy should be guided by HbA1c concentrations, as with type II diabetes mellitus. Hyperlipidemia: annual screening of lipid profile should be undertaken, with treatment thresholds and targets based on those advocated for the high risk general population. Dietary intervention is appropriate for all patients. A statin should be considered as the first line treatment to achieve specified targets. In patients receiving a calcineurin inhibitor, Pravastatin should be commenced at a dose of 10 mg/day. In patients receiving other forms of immunosuppression, pravastatin may be commenced at a dose of 20 mg/day. Liver tests should be monitored and patients warned to report myalgia. If monotherapy is inadequate, ezetimibe or a fibrate may be added. Consideration may be given to change in immunosuppression if combination lipid-lowering therapy proves inadequate.",

    "891": "We previously reported that a combined therapy with heparin/warfarin and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors dramatically reduces proteinuria for prolonged periods in advanced IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In the present study, we prospectively analyzed whether the combined therapy can inhibit the progressive decline in renal function of patients with progressive IgAN. Patients who had a marked linearity of decline in loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), assessed by reciprocal serum creatinine plots vs. time for more than one year, were recruited in this study if they were histologically diagnosed as IgAN at this point of declining renal function. Twelve patients were eligible for trial entry; reciprocal serum creatinine plot suggested end-stage renal failure within 5 years. All patients were treated with continuous intravenous infusion of heparin for 8 weeks, followed by oral administration of warfarin, ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers and dypiridamole. Eight patients were further given corticosteroid for 2 years because of the presence of acute glomerular lesions such as cellular crescent or angionecrosis. All patients were followed-up for at least 12 months, and the mean follow-up period was 34 +/- 20 (range 12-79) months. After the combined therapy, urinary protein excretion was significantly reduced from 2.4 +/- 1.5 g/day at baseline to 0.7 +/- 0.5 g/day at final observation, while the mean serum creatinine was not significantly different. Of note, the mean slope of 1/serum creatinine significantly increased from -0.009 to +0.0002 dl/mg/week (p < 0.05). Moreover, histological analysis of a repeat kidney biopsy which was performed in 5 patients at 2 years after the institution of the combined therapy revealed that the percentage of cellular/fibrocellular crescent and the degree of mesangial matrix expansion were significantly attenuated (19-->0.1% and 1.6-->0.6 score, respectively) while the percentage of global sclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesion did not increase. These results indicate that our combined therapy with heparin/warfarin and RAS inhibitors can inhibit the progressive decline in renal function Combined Heparin/Warfarin and RAS Inhibitors in Progressive IgAN 115 of patients with progressive IgAN through its marked antiproteinuric and anti-inflammatory effects.", 
    "892": "The pathological role of obesity has rarely been studied in primary glomerular diseases. The purpose of this study is to examine the clinicopathological influence of obesity in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). 74 patients with IgA nephropathy in our institution from October 2000 to January 2004 were retrospectively divided into two groups according to body mass index (BMI): the non-obese group (group N) with BMI < 25 kg/m(2), and the obese group (group O) with BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2). There were 50 patients in group N and 24 patients in group O. Clinical analysis showed no significant difference between these two groups in blood pressure, serum cholesterol, creatinine clearances or grade of hematuria. However, urinary protein excretion and serum creatinine were significantly greater in group O than in group N. Although semiquantitative analysis of light-microscopical findings showed no significant differences in the severity of mesangial proliferation, matrix expansion, glomerulosclerosis or crescent formation, image analysis showed that total glomerular area and tuft area were significantly larger in group O. In addition, ultrastructural study revealed significantly higher glomerular basement membrane thickness in group O. 62 patients (46 patients, group N; 16 patients, group O) were followed in our institution for one year. Urinary protein was significantly decreased only in patients who received steroid in both groups. Although administration of ACE inhibitor or ARB tended to decrease urinary protein in group O, the change was not statistically significant. Our findings indicate that obesity may accelerate the increase of proteinuria in IgAN through ultrastructural modification of the glomerular basement membrane.", 
    "893": "In IgA nephropathy (IgAN), ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are beneficial against hypertension, and their anti-proteinuric effect has been clearly demonstrated. However, sub-analyses of IgAN patients enrolled in large studies failed to prove a benefit against progression to renal failure. The European Community Biomed Concerted Action - a placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial begun in 1995 - in children and adults (9-35 years old) with proteinuria > 1 < 3.5 g/day/1.73 m(2) and normal or moderately reduced renal function proved the significant benefit of ACE-I on progression of kidney disease. The combination of ACE-I and ARB in proteinuric normotensive IgAN patients showed greater antiproteinuric effect and the COOPERATE trial also reported a superior effect of combination therapy in protecting against renal function deterioration. Treating IgAN with fish oil has a good rationale for renal inflammation as well as for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity. However, the published reports gave conflicting conclusions and also very recent data did not show significant benefits. In conclusion, ACE-I and ARB have a definite role in treating IgAN, particularly the hypertensive and proteinuric forms. These patients should be treated to target BP to <130/70 mm Hg and proteinuria <0.5 g/day.", 
    "894": "The pathophysiology of right ventricular (RV) remodeling is a complex process and may include unique elements not observed in left ventricular (LV) remodeling. The RV also has a relatively irregular geometry not accounted for in LV analyses. RV remodeling includes basic changes in geometry, wall thickness, and ventricular pressure-volume relationships. Also, myocyte dimensions and number increase, and myocardial extracellular matrix and biochemical milieu are modified. Remodeling has been associated with such diseases as pulmonary hypertension, lung transplant, LV pathology, Chagas' disease, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Disease progression may lead to further RV changes, including hypertrophy, dilatation, and subsequently to variable alterations in RV hemodynamic status. The multiple methods to assess RV hypertrophy include cine magnetic resonance imaging and 3-D echocardiography. Each technique offers different precision in evaluating RV dimensions and functional performance characteristics. Strategies to prevent RV remodeling include pharmacological agents, such as vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as more invasive interventions, such as ventricular assist devices.", 
    "895": "The Renoprotection of Optimal Antiproteinuric Doses (ROAD) study was performed to determine whether titration of benazepril or losartan to optimal antiproteinuric doses would safely improve the renal outcome in chronic renal insufficiency. A total of 360 patients who did not have diabetes and had proteinuria and chronic renal insufficiency were randomly assigned to four groups. Patients received open-label treatment with a conventional dosage of benazepril (10 mg/d), individual uptitration of benazepril (median 20 mg/d; range 10 to 40), a conventional dosage of losartan (50 mg/d), or individual uptitration of losartan (median 100 mg/d; range 50 to 200). Uptitration was performed to optimal antiproteinuric and tolerated dosages, and then these dosages were maintained. Median follow-up was 3.7 yr. The primary end point was time to the composite of a doubling of the serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Secondary end points included changes in the level of proteinuria and the rate of progression of renal disease. Compared with the conventional dosages, optimal antiproteinuric dosages of benazepril and losartan that were achieved through uptitration were associated with a 51 and 53% reduction in the risk for the primary end point (P = 0.028 and 0.022, respectively). Optimal antiproteinuric dosages of benazepril and losartan, at comparable BP control, achieved a greater reduction in both proteinuria and the rate of decline in renal function compared with their conventional dosages. There was no significant difference for the overall incidence of major adverse events between groups that were given conventional and optimal dosages in both arms. It is concluded that uptitration of benazepril or losartan against proteinuria conferred further benefit on renal outcome in patients who did not have diabetes and had proteinuria and renal insufficiency.", 
    "896": "Recent studies have shown that patients with heart failure over-express pro-inflammatory cytokines which enhance natural killer (NK) activity and negatively influence contractility and contribute to the remodeling of myocardium. The question is that how cardiovascular drugs influence on the cytokines of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) in Chronic Heart Failure (CHF). To study the effect of cardiovascular drugs on PBMCs-cytokines and NK activity of CHF patients. PBMCs of CHF patients/normal controls collected by Ficoll-paque density centrifugation. NK activity against K562 target cell was measured with MTT colorimetric assay. PBMCs were cultivated in RPMI/FCS, stimulated with phytohaemaglutinin (PHA). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2 and IL-1beta of culture supernatants after 24 h incubation with/without furosemide, captopril and digoxin were measured with sandwitch ELISA. Patients had higher NK activity than controls (56.9% +/- 1.6 vs 50.9% +/- 1.2, p < 0.05). NK activity of patients who already consumed Captopril/Furosemide didn't show difference with controls. Captopril (3, 1, 0.3 microg mL(-1)) and Furosemide (5, 2.5, 1.25 microg mL(-1)) caused a dose dependent inhibition in TNF-alpha compared with control (329 +/- 23, 427 +/- 15, 519 +/- 19 and 343 +/- 19, 430 +/- 14, respectively vs. 562 +/- 24 pg mL(-1) p < 0.05). Furosemide caused a dose dependent decrease in IL-6 (421 +/- 31, 534 +/- 33 vs. 662 +/- 41 pg mL(-1) p < 0.05). Captopril and Furosemide didn't show any significant effect on IL-1beta/IL-2. Digoxin had no significant effect on PBMCs-cytokines. These data suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of Captopril and Furosemide may contribute to their beneficial and no long-term adverse effects on PBMCs.",

Patients were randomized to Cilazapril 2.5-5.0 mg/day (n=70), Enalapril 10-20 mg/day (n=82), Perindoril 4-8 mg/day (n=73), or Imidapril 10-20 mg/day (n=76). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day was added if needed. Using a dechallenge and rechallenge method, a strict criteria to attribute cough to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) not yet used in previous reports, the cough incidence were as follows: (1) Cilazapril--22.86% (16/70), (2) Enalapril--21.95% (18/82), (3) Perindopril--10.96% (6/73), and (4) Imidapril--13.16% (10/76) (P=0.041).

    "901": "This report describes a variant of transient regional left ventricular dysfunction in which isolated basal left ventricular akinesia with normal mid-ventricular (papillary-level) wall motion and apical hypercontractility were noted in young women (mean age 31 years). This finding was demonstrated in 3 consecutive patients; the first patient was experiencing emotional life-altering events, and the second presented with an acute flare of multiple sclerosis. The third patient presented < 24 hours after methamphetamine use. Coronary angiography demonstrated normal epicardial coronary arteries in all patients. Wall motion abnormalities resolved within 2 to 6 weeks. In conclusion, the entity described in this report is reminiscent of apical ballooning (\"Tako-Tsubo\"), mid-ventricular ballooning, and apical sparing syndromes; however, isolated basal left ventricular involvement has not been previously described and is a newer variant in the spectrum of transient cardiomyopathies. The pathophysiology of this entity has not been elucidated. A unifying feature between the transient cardiomyopathic syndromes most likely is in the concentration, distribution, and activity of cardiac adrenergic receptors.",

The association of statin therapy at the initial screening visit with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. After adjusting for age, gender, race, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, New York Heart Association functional class IV, estimated glomerular filtration rate, current cigarette smoking, left ventricular ejection fraction, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, antiplatelet therapy, diabetes mellitus, treatment group (beta blocker or placebo), and hypertension, statin use was independently associated with decreased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.38, confidence interval 0.18 to 0.82, p = 0.0134) and also with decreased cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 0.42, confidence interval 0.18 to 0.95, p = 0.037). In conclusion, in patients with moderate or severe HF due to non-IDC entered into BEST, statin therapy at entry was independently associated with a decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "903": "The aim of this study is to assess the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in predicting long-term risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after electrical cardioversion. CRP levels are associated with the presence of AF and failure of electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion, but no previous study has assessed their predictive role in long-term follow-up after successful electrical cardioversion. One hundred two consecutive patients (age 67 +/- 11 years; 58 men) with nonvalvular persistent AF who underwent successful biphasic electrical cardioversion were studied. High-sensitivity CRP was measured immediately before cardioversion. Follow-up was performed up to 1 year in all cases. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to CRP quartiles. Patients in the lowest CRP quartile (<1.9 mg/L) had significantly lower rates of AF recurrence (4% vs 33% at 3 months in the other 3 groups combined, p = 0.007, and 28% vs 60% at 1 year, p = 0.01). The 4 groups were similar in age, gender, ejection fraction, and left atrial size. Survival analysis confirmed that patients in the lowest CRP quartile had a lower recurrence rate (p = 0.02). Cox regression analyses using age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, ejection fraction, left atrial diameter, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists, and statins, and CRP quartiles as covariates showed that only CRP was independently associated with AF recurrence during follow-up (hazard ratio 4.98, 95% confidence interval 1.75 to 14.26, p = 0.003). In conclusion, low CRP is associated with long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion for nonvalvular AF.", 
    "904": "Previous studies of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACSs) complicated by heart failure (HF) have focused primarily on patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction defined by an ejection fraction (EF) <40%. Little is known about HF with preserved systolic function (EF > or =40%) in the NSTE ACS population. We identified high-risk patients with NSTE ACS (ischemic electrocardiographic changes and/or positive cardiac markers) from the CRUSADE quality improvement initiative who had an EF recorded and who had information on HF status. Management and outcomes were analyzed and compared based on the presence or absence of HF and whether left ventricular EF was > or =40%. Of 94,558 patients with NSTE ACS, 21,561 (22.8%) presented with signs of HF, and most had HF with preserved systolic function (n = 11,860, 55%). Mortality rates were 10.7% for HF/systolic dysfunction, 5.8% for HF/preserved systolic function, 5.7% for no HF/systolic dysfunction, and 1.5% for no HF/preserved systolic function. Use of guideline-recommended medical therapies and interventions was frequently significantly lower in those with HF regardless of EF compared with those without HF, except for use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In conclusion, NSTE ACS complicated by HF with preserved systolic function is common and associated with a 2.3-fold higher mortality compared with NSTE ACS without HF or systolic dysfunction. Guideline-recommended therapies and interventions are under-utilized in patients with NSTE ACS and HF, with and without preserved systolic function, compared with those without HF.",

However, recent data from a meta-analysis, including the ALLHAT study, and a study in Canadian diabetic patients questioned the usefulness of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in delaying the onset of dialysis. Publication of these data led to an intensive recent debate among reputed nephrologists, with numerous pros and cons regarding the pharmacological influence of CKD progression. The authors of the present review critically discuss the arguments and counterarguments of this challenging debate. Finally, a cautious view for the practicing nephrologist is expressed, highlighting the difference between study patients and real-life patients, and the possible overlooked aspects of recent renal protection studies (the importance of central blood pressure, of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and possible, the impact of angiotensin converting inhibitors on stroke), are presented.",
