    "0": "A triphasic pattern of blood pressure response was observed in 13 of 26 patients treated with captopril. Pressure fell after the first dose in all but 3 patients, reaching a minimum by 90 min. Over the next several days, pressure either remained at this level (n = 13) or returned towards control levels (n = 13) even with increased dosage. Blood pressure then fell gradually, usually reaching a level by 10 days that was equal to or slightly lower than that after the first dose. The secondary rise in blood pressure was more frequent and pronounced in patients who had larger initial responses and higher renin levels. The transient increase in pressure could not be explained by failure of blockade of the renin system, since aldosterone excretion was maximally suppressed by the second day of treatment. The data indicate that both the blood pressure response to the first dose and the renin level can be used to predict the long-term response to captopril.", 
    "1": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is a valuable pharmacological tool for studying the role of intrarenal humoral factors such as the renin-angiotensin and kallikrenin-kinin systems and prostaglandins as related to the regulation of renal function and the interrelation among them. An intrarenal infusion of such an inhibitor, YS-980 (thiazolidine carboxylic acid derivative), at a rate of 0.1 mg/min resulted in a significant fall in systemic arterial blood pressure and a significant increase in renal blood flow, urine flow, urinary excretion of sodium and renin release in anesthetized dogs. These renal effects evoked by YS-980 were abolished after the inhibition of kallikrein as induced by aprotinin (900 kallikrein inhibitory units per min). In addition, YS-980 given after the administration of indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on the renal hemodynamics and renin release except for the urinary excretion of sodium. These findings suggest that both the kallikrein-kinin system and prostaglandins contribute to the renal action and the vasodepressor effect of YS-980. It would appear that the intrarenal administration of this angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor induced marked renal effects through activation of kinin and prostaglandins and that the relative contribution of the renin-angiotensin system is negligible in anesthetized dogs.", 
    "2": "The chronic effects of the oral administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 63-80 mg/kg/day) on blood pressure and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were studied in normotensive male Wistar rats. The blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma renin substrate concentration (PRS), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and renal renin content (RRC) were measured 2, 9, 19, 29 and 58 days after the administration of the agent. Blood pressure was determined in unanesthetized rats, and blood samples were obtained by decapitation. Furthermore, blood pressure responses to bolus injections of angiotensin II (AII, 80 ng/kg), angiotensin I (AI, 80 ng/kg) and bradykinin (BK, 10 micrograms/kg) were examined in unanesthetized rats which had been given the agent for 20 days. The BP of the rats which had been given captopril for 9 days or more was significantly lower than in the control rats. The reduction in heart weight in the captopril rats reached a statistically significant level 58 days after the administration of the agent. The PRA and the PRC markedly increased, and the PRS and the PAC both decreased in the captopril rats. The RRC which was reduced after 2 days of captopril administration markedly increased thereafter. In the captopril rats, significant negative correlations were observed between PRC and PRS (r=-0.43, p<0.01), and between BP and PRC (r=-0.60, p<0.001). The PRC significantly correlated with the RRC in the control rats (r=-0.44, p<0.01) while such a relationship did not exist in the captopril rats. Although the pressor responses to AII were similar in the captopril and the control rats, the responses to AI were reduced to 50% of the responses to AII in the captopril rats. The blood pressure reduction in response to BK in the captopril rats was 2.3 times as great as that in the control rats. Thus, it is suggested that the increases in PRA, PRC and RRC in the captopril rats may be related to both the blood pressure reduction and interruption of the negative feedback inhibition of renin synthesis and release by AII, and that the decrease in PRS in the captopril rats is due to the increased consumption and probably to the decreased rate of substrate production in the liver which is secondary to the decrease in plasma AII. The lack of significant positive correlation between PRC and RRC in the captopril rats seems to demonstrate that captopril may modify the relationship between them. The results also show that the chronic administration of captopril lowers blood pressure in normotensive animals. The blood pressure reduction by captopril may be related to the decreased kininase activity which is suggested by the enhanced depressor responses to BK, as well as the lowered plasma level of AII.", 
    "3": "Eight patients with severe congestive heart failure refractory to conventional therapy, including vasodilators, were given captopril (seven patients) or teprotide (one patient). All had dyspnea, edema, elevated pulmonary wedge pressure (28.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg), low cardiac index (1.6 +/- 0.1 liters per minute per square meter), and elevated levels of serum creatinine (2.3 +/- 0.2 mg per deciliter [203.3 +/- 17.7 mumol per liter]), blood urea nitrogen (48 +/- 5 mg per deciliter [17.1 +/- 1.8 mmol of urea per liter]), plasma renin activity (21 +/- 7 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour), plasma angiotensin II (271 +/- 51 pg per milliliter), and plasma aldosterone (65 +/- 14 ng per deciliter). After one week of therapy, all indexes improved. Creatinine and p-aminohippurate clearances were also increased (P less than 0.01). Improvement was sustained (more than six months) and was associated with a statistically significant increase in the cardiac ejection fraction (12 +/- 3 to 26 +/- 7 per cent). With a mean follow-up of seven months, the New York Heart Association Functional Class has been reduced from IV to II, and the number of days of hospitalization to less than 10 per cent of that before captopril therapy. We conclude that captopril reduces afterload in advanced congestive heart failure and induces sustained improvements in clinical status and renal function.", 
    "4": "Two cases of high-renin renovascular hypertension, one due to Takayasu's arteritis and the other to a hypersensitivity vasculitis, are described. Both were resistant to maximal standard therapy but responded to treatment with captopril, the orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "5": "Renal biopsies were performed on 13 patients treated with captopril. In 4 patients findings indicated an early stage of membranous glomerulopathy (MGP). In the other patients electron microscopy showed scanty small subepithelial deposits and immunofluorescence revealed a patchy granular pattern along the glomerular basement membrane. One of the 4 patients with MGP presented with nephrotic syndrome and another with serum-sickness-like syndrome. None of the other patients, including 2 with MGP, had proteinuria or deterioration of renal function. Thus captopril may be associated with the development of immune-complex glomerulopathy.", 
    "6": "Captopril is a potent hypotensive agent whose efficacy has hitherto been attributed to its ability to alter either angiotensin II formation or kinin degradation. Our purpose was to examine captopril's acute effect on prostaglandin production, because changes in neither the renin-angiotensin nor the kallikrein-kinin systems appear adequate to account for the fall in arterial pressure. The plasma levels of angiotensin II, kinins, and prostaglandins were determined in response to increasing doses (5, 12.5, and 25 mg) of captopril and these responses were compared with the change in arterial pressure observed in nine supine normal male subjects studied on both a high (200 meq) and low (10 meq) sodium intake.Captopril significantly (P < 0.01) increased the levels of the 13,14-dihydro-15-keto metabolite of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)-M), a potent vasodilator, with similar responses being observed on both a high and a low sodium intake. No significant changes in the plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F (1)alpha, or thromboxane B(2), the stable products of prostacyclin and thromboxane A(2), respectively, occurred. The depressor response to captopril correlated with the change in PGE(2)-M (r = 0.52, t = 5.44, P < 0.0001). On the other hand, although significant (P < 0.02) decrements in angiotensin II and increments in plasma kinins accompanied the hypotensive response in sodium-restricted subjects, in sodium-loaded subjects where the renin-angiotensin system was suppressed, no change in angiotensin II, and only a modest change in kinins was noted, even though significant (P < 0.01) decrements in diastolic blood pressure occurred (-10+/-2 mm Hg).Thus, changes in depressor prostaglandin production can better account for the hypotensive response to captopril, thereby extending to yet another vasoactive system an influence by this class of drugs and providing a new approach to dissecting the abnormality in the control of vascular tone in patients with hypertension.", 
    "7": "Application of a renal artery clip in rats with an undisturbed contralateral kidney caused a sustained increase in blood pressure and a transient rise of plasma renin activity and water intake. The response of blood pressure, plasma renin activity and water intake was augmented after reapplication of the clip to normotensive declipped rats (renal hypertensive rats, from which the clip had been removed 24h before the reapplication). The time-course of the changes of blood pressure, plasma renin activity and water intake were similar after the initial application as after reapplication of the clip. Administration of an inhibitor (SQ 14.225) of the converting enzyme abolished the increase in blood pressure and water intake after reapplication of the clip. These data indicate a critical role of renin in the rise of blood pressure and water intake after initial application of a renal artery clip as well as after reapplication of the clip to declipped rats.", 
    "8": "The primacy of angiotensin II as the mediator of the adrenal's response to sodium restriction is controversial. We administered the oral converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14225), to test whether reduction of angiotension II generation for 26 h in sodium-restricted subjects would lower plasma aldosterone levels to values observed in subjects on a high sodium intake. Accordingly, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were measured in nine recumbent normal subjects on high (200 meq) and low (10 meq) sodium intakes and low sodium intake with captopril (12.5--25 mg four times a day for 26 h). Captopril reduced the sodium-restricted angiotensin II levels from 31 +/- 6 to 13 +/- 2 pg/ml, which was indistinguishable from that measured on the high sodium intake (11 +/- 2 pg/ml). Concomitantly, aldosterone levels were reduced from 25 +/- 4 to 7 +/- 1 ng/dl, which was similar to the high sodium value (8 +/- 1 ng/dl). There were no significant changes in serum sodium, cortisol, or potassium at the three sampling times. Thus, the complete suppression of the sodium-restricted levels of both angiotensin II and aldosterone into the high sodium range by captopril provides strong support for the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system is the prime mediator of the adrenal's response to sodium restriction.", 
    "9": "1. Changes in arterial blood pressure, blood angiotensin I, plasma angiotensin II and plasma angiotensin III were measured in conscious sodium-depleted dogs after infusion of captopril, an orally active inhibitor of converting enzyme. 2. Angiotensins II and III were measured after chromatography to remove angiotensin I, which increased in concentration after inhibition of converting enzyme and which interfered in the direct assay for angiotensin II. 3. Infusion of captopril at 20, 200, 2000 and 6000 microgram h-1 kg-1, each for 3 h, produced a rapid fall in blood pressure and in concentration of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II was undetectable at 6000 microgram h-1 kg-1 (mean pre-infusion value for all samples was 39 +/- SD 15 pmol/1, n = 14). 4. The percentage fall in blood pressure correlated with the percentage fall in plasma angiotensin II (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). 5. These results suggest that the initial fall in blood pressure may be mediated in part by the suppression of angiotensin II. 6. Blood angiotensin I concentration rose with each rate of infusion of drug to a maximum 16-fold increase at 6000 microgram h-1 kg-1 (26-416 pmol/l). The rise in angiotensin I was inversely related to the fall in angiotensin II (r = 0.68, P < 0.001).", 
    "10": "1. Lower-body subatmospheric (negative) pressure led to a prompt reduction in central venous pressure and arterial blood pressure. Arterial blood pressure was then restored within 30 s and there was a tachycardia. These reflex responses have been used to investigate the role angiotensin plays in blood pressure control. 2. The initial plasma renin activity (2.9 ng of angiotensin I h-1 ml-1) did not change during the brief lowering of pressure. Before pressure was lowered neither the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor nor a competitive antagonist, [Sar1, Ala8]-angiotensin II, lowered arterial pressure. 3. Nevertheless, after inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by these agents, the reduction in blood pressure induced by lower-body negative pressure became greater and the blood pressure recovery was impaired. 4. The findings suggest that angiotensin, at a blood concentration which has no direct effect on blood pressure, interacts with the sympathetic nervous system to maintain arterial blood pressure.", 
    "11": "Intracranial injection of angiotensin II (AII) or activation of the cerebral isorenin-angiotensin system with intracranial renin causes an immediate thirst and a delayed sodium appetite in the rat. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a polypeptide trophic factor for peripheral sympathetic and sensory neurones, has also been reported to be a potent stimulus to thirst and sodium appetite when injected into the brain of the rat. Lewis et al. drew attention to the marked similarity between the effects of 2.5S NGF and renin on thirst and sodium appetite and suggested that the NGF responses were mediated by the cerebral isorenin-angiotensin system. We report here that NGF-induced thirst and sodium appetite, as well as increased blood pressure and increase ornithine decarboxylase activity in the brain and liver, depend on the formation of AII (see also ref. 6).", 
    "12": "The effects of Captopril (SQ 14,225) were studied in mice both by measuring the reaction time and observing the number of jumping mice in the 'hot-plate' test. Subcutaneous injections of captopril (0.1--0.4 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in the reaction time at the 4th hour after the injection while no difference in the reaction time was observed at other times. Captopril caused a clear-cut increase in the number of jumping mice which was found to be greater with lower doses of the compound. Morphine alone did not cause an increase in the number of jumping mice, but increased the reaction time which reached a maximum 1 h after administration and gradually returned to the control level after 6 h. Injection of morphine to the captopril-pretreated mice caused a highly significant increase in reaction time remaining above the control values for 3 h. This effect of morphine was antagonized by naloxone (2 mg/kg, s.c.). Captopril, when given together with morphine, prevented the increase in reaction time over 2 h, but caused a progressive and significant increase within 6 h. Morphine also prevented the jumping behaviour induced by captopril. Aprotinin (50,000 KIU/kg i.p.) when given together with captopril, produced a significant increase in reaction time but almost completely blocked the jumping reaction. Aprotinin also prevented the captopril-induced increase in the number of jumping mice. The possible mechanisms of analgesia and jumping behaviour due to thermal stimulation are discussed in the light of these findings.", 
    "13": "the effect of captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline), a converting enzyme inhibitor, on the systemic blood pressure in pentobarbital anesthetized rats was investigated. Experiments were performed in four groups of rats: untreated, Na-restricted, furosemide treated and bilaterally nephrectomized, respectively. Intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of captopril caused a significant hypotensive effect in the three groups of rats but not in the nephrectomized group. Individual values for the hypotensive effect produced by captopril and plasma renin activity obtained just before injection of captopril showed a highly significant correlation.", 
    "14": "The ability of captopril (SQ-14225), an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, to reduce blood pressure in dogs anesthetized with either pentobarbital sodium or a combination of morphine plus chloralose was studied over a sixty minute period. In addition, since both of these anesthetic agents cause an increase in the plasma renin activity of these animals, the drug was used to further investigate whether the hypotensive action of this drug is dependent on the level of plasma renin activity. Captopril produced significant but similar decreases in blood pressure of both the anesthetized groups, even though the blood pressure of the morphine-chloralose dogs was significantly lower than that of the pentobarbital animals. Further, the hypotensive action of captopril was not related to the level of plasma renin activity, since the morphine-chloralose dogs had a significantly higher plasma renin activity. It is concluded that the magnitude of blood pressure reduction following the administration of captopril is not related to the level of blood pressure and the pre-drug plasma renin activity and hitherto unexplained mechanisms in addition to the converting enzyme inhibition may be involved in the hypotensive action of this drug.", 
    "15": "The role of endogenous prostaglandins in the antihypertensive mechanism of orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor in low renin hypertension was investigated. In the SQ 14225-responders with low renin hypertension, blood pressure was elevated to control level and antihypertensive effect of SQ 14225 was attenuated after the inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin, while no significant change in blood pressure was found in the SQ 14225-responders with normal renin hypertension. Urinary prostaglandin E excretion was not significantly increased after the SQ 14225 administration but significantly decreased after the administration of indomethacin. There was no significant difference in urinary prostaglandin E excretion between normal renin hypertension and low renin hypertension. These results suggest that SQ 14225 may potentiate extrarenal vasodilating prostaglandin system, probably vascular prostaglandin system, contributing to the antihypertensive mechanism in SQ 14225-responders with low renin hypertension. The augmented renin release following SQ 14225 administration was inhibited by indomethacin, suggesting that endogenous prostaglandin system may contribute to the negative short feedback mechanism of renin release.", 
    "16": "The disposition of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with antihypertensive properties, was studied in 10 normal male subjects after a single 100-mg tablet of 35S-labeled drug. Average absorption parameters for unchanged captopril in blood were Tmax 0.93 +/- 0.08 hr and Cmax 800 +/- 76 ng/ml. For total radioactivity in blood the values were Tmax 1.05 +/- 0.08 hr and Cmax 1,580 +/- 90 ng/ml (as captopril equivalents). Because of the curvilinearity of the semilogarithmic plots of blood concentrations of captopril:time, elimination half-life (t1/2) of unchanged drug could not be determined. At 1 hr unchanged captopril accounted for about 52% of total radioactivity in blood, and the dimeric disulfide metabolite of captopril accounted for about 10%. In the first 5 days after dosing, an average of about 68% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 18% in feces. The distribution of radioactivity in the first 24-hr urine sample (66% of the dose) was 58% captopril (38% of dose), 2% captopril disulfide (1.5% of dose), and 40% unidentified polar metabolites (26% of dose).", 
    "17": "Intraperitoneal administration of paraquat to mice produced a linear dose-response increase (20 to 50 mg/kg of body weight) in serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The peak increase (31%) in ACE occurred after 50 mg/kg of paraquat and began at approximately 4 h. ACE was still significantly elevated 8 h after the administration of paraquat, but it began to return to normal 24 h later. Although serum ACE increased during the first 5 h after the administration of paraquat, lung ACE decreased. The enzyme that we measured in mouse serum was inhibited 100% by 10(-7) M of SQ 20881, a known ACE inhibitor.", 
    "18": "The effects of an angiotensin-II analog (saralasin, i.v.) and of a converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, oral) were compared in 12 sodium-depleted patients with hypertension. The decrease of the mean intraarterial pressure (MAP) with captopril (-21.5 +/- [SEM] 4.3 mm Hg) was more pronounced (P < 0.001) than the change of MAP during saralasin (-10.5 +/- 4.0 mm Hg). The pretreatment arterial plasma renin activity (log PRA) was closely related to the change of MAP during saralasin (r = -0.94; P < 0.001) and also to the captopril-induced change of MAP (r = -0.82; P < 0.001); similar results were obtained for the log plasma angiotensin (PA) I and II levels. The change of MAP was more pronounced, however, with captopril than during saralasin at any level of pretreatment PRA, PAI or PAII. Saralasin did not affect heart rate (P > 0.4), but during captopril the heart rate increased by 5.1 beats/min (P < 0.001). Captopril produced a 70% decrease of PAII, but the change of MAP was poorly related to the changes of PAII (r = -0.57; P < 0.05); PRA and PAI rose threefold to fourfold. PRA, PAI, and PAII all increased during saralasin. These observations may suggest that the antihypertensive action of captopril is not based solely on the inhibition of AII formation, but also the agonistic effect of saralasin has to be considered.", 
    "19": "Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 13 weeks old, received oral administration of captopril (SQ14,225) daily at a dose of 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg; or water at 2 ml/kg, for 6 weeks. Captopril suppressed the development of hypertension slightly at the lower dose and completely at the higher dose. At 6 weeks of dosing, hemodynamic parameters were measured by the tracer microsphere method and blood volume by the dilution method using 51Cr erythrocytes. Cardiac output (CO) increased and mean blood pressure decreased in a dose-dependent manner; thus, total peripheral resistance decreased. Cerebral and renal blood flows increased in a dose-dependent manner while blood flow to other organs tended to increase or remained unchanged. There was no significant differences in the circulating blood volume among the three groups. In conclusion, long-term blockade of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with captopril dilated blood vessels in the whole body, especially in the brain and kidney, and lowered blood pressure without causing plasma expansion or tachycardia.", 
    "20": "The hemodynamic effects of an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, were evaluated in 10 symptomatic patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In all patients there was a significant increase in cardiac output (average 28%), stroke volume (49%), and stroke work index (26%), along with a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (48%), indicating improved left ventricular function. Modest decreases in heart rate and arterial pressure were also observed. In seven patients maintained on captopril therapy, repeat hemodynamic studies at 2 months revealed sustained effects. These beneficial hemodynamic effects were accompanied by clinical improvement and improved exercise tolerance during maintenance therapy. These findings suggest that captopril may be a useful therapeutic adjunct for the long-term management of patients with chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "21": "Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme emerges as a new promising approach to the treatment of hypertension. The intravenously administered teprotide appears to be suitable as a diagnostic test and for initial treatment of certain hypertensive emergencies. The oral inhibitor captopril is effective for chronic maintenance of blood pressure control in various types of hypertension but has been associated with a number of adverse reactions.", 
    "22": "Captopril, an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme, was administered in a single dose to five anephric patients who had extremely low plasma renin activities. The drug did not lower blood pressure or significantly alter plasma renin activity in any patient but increased mean arterial pressure slightly in three. These results suggest that the blood-pressure lowering effect of captopril depends on an active renal renin-angiotensin system. Though additional mechanisms, such as accumulation of vasodilator kinins resulting from kininase II inhibition, may also contribute to captopril's action, these mechanisms apparently require the presence of the kidney to have a clinically detectable effect.", 
    "23": "The blood pressure lowering effect of the orally effective converting-enzyme-inhibitor captopril (SQ 14.225) was investigated in a double-blind study in 20 patients with moderate essential hypertension. During treatment with captopril alone (150 mg t.i.c.) blood pressure dropped from an average of 167/111 to 148/99 mm Hg lying and from 164/113 to 143/99 mm Hg upright whereby 4 patients showed normalisation of their blood pressure (less than 145/95 mm Hg). There was no significant change of pulse frequency. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide led to return to normal of blood pressure in all patients. Even after 6 months of treatment tolerance had not developed. The antihypertensive effect of captopril alone paralleled the one of hydrochlorothiazide and there were no side effects. Activity of the converting enzyme in serum as well as plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone were clearly lowered by captopril whereas plasma renin activity increased significantly. Renal sodium and water excretion and glomerular filtration rate were not influenced.", 
    "24": "High doses of captopril (SQ 14, 225) (120-160 mg/kg/day) were administered orally to normal rats, and the effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were observed. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was elevated significantly on the 3rd, 7th and 30th days of captopril administration. ACE activity in the lung and the kidney was significantly decreased on the 1st day then gradually increased, becoming significantly higher than that of controls by the 30th day. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly elevated on the 1st day and remained at a high level until the 30th day. Renal renin content was found to be significantly lower on the 1st and 3rd days. Plasma aldosterone concentration was not affected by captopril treatment, whereas serum potassium concentration was found to be significantly lower on the 1st, 3rd and 30th days. It is suggested that besides its inhibitory action on ACE, captopril has a direct or indirect stimulating action on ACE production as well as on renin release.", 
    "25": "The biological significance of active and inactive renin was investigated by comparison of an in-vitro assay of active, total and inactive plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and II with an in-vivo change in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) produced by antagonism of angiotensin with treatment with saralasin and by blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme by treatment with captopril. A significant relationship between the changes in MAP during treatment with saralasin and captopril with the pretreatment levels of PRA, active and total PRC and angiotensin II were found; while the pre-existing level of inactive renin was not a predictor for the hypotensive effect of saralasin and captopril. During treatment with saralasin and captopril significant increases in PRA, plasma angiotensin I concentration and total and active PRC were found and no change in inactive PRC was observed.", 
    "26": "Recent studies have suggested a possible causative relationship between elevated plasma levels of Angiotensin II (AII) and the vasoconstriction associated with conventional cardiopulmonary bypass. The haemodynamic effects of SQ14225, a specific angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, have been studied in a group of five dogs submitted to a 60 min period of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A 20 min infusion of SQ14225 in a dose of 2 microgram .kg-1 .h-1 was administered to each dog 2 h after the end of the period of CPB. Measurements of peripheral vascular resistance index (PVRI), cardiac index (CI) and plasma levels of Angiotensin II were obtained at the start and end of the infusion period. The results in the five blocked dogs were compared with a control series of ten unblocked dogs submitted to an identical cardiopulmonary bypass regine. In the blocked dogs, PVRI fell significantly during infusion of SQ14225 from 38.27 units to 21.70 units (P <0.01). There was a simultaneous significant increase in cardiac index from 3.00 to 3.98 litre.m2 .min-1 (P <0.01). Plasma Angiotensin 11 levels fell in the blocked dogs from 57 to 11.5 pg.cm-2 during the infusion period (normal levels <15 pg.cm-3). In the control unblocked dogs, there was no corresponding fall in PVRI, no rise in cardiac index, and no fall in elevated plasma AII levels. The difference between the groups were statistically highly significant (P <0.005). These results indicate that reduction in elevated plasma AII levels after CPB using converting enzyme inhibitor SQ14225 is associated with a significant fall in peripheral vascular resistance and a significant rise in cardiac index. In addition, the study confirms the causative relationship between elevated plasma levels of Angiotensin II and the increased vasoconstriction associated with non-pulsatile CPB.", 
    "27": "Unilateral nephrectomy of sodium-restricted male Sprague-Dawley rats produced a sustained elevation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) that was reversed by sodium repletion. A chronic intraperitoneal infuson of SQ14,225 prevented the development of hypertension in sodium-deplete unilaterally nephrectomized rats. Sodium depletion of two-kidney rats increased SBP to a lesser extent, while unilateral nephrectomy of sodium replete animals had no effect. These results provide evidence for a new model of experimental hypertension in the rat and emphasize the importance of a renal component, as demonstrated by unilateral nephrectomy, in the maintenance of normal pressure-volume relationships.", 
    "28": "Intravenous injection of the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ14,225 (captopril, 2 mg/kg) reduced the blood pressure of anesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) progressively over a 3-hour period. An indistinguishable fall in blood pressure occurred in SHR that were bilaterally nephrectomized 1 hour prior to injection of the converting enzyme inhibitor. In the nephrectomized animals, plasma renin activity (PRA) had fallen to less than 30% of its initial values at the time of injection. Injection of the vehicle alone had no effect on blood pressure in either anephric or intact SHR. The converting enzyme inhibitor produced no significant change in the blood pressure of either intact or anephric normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (NT-WK) rats. Infusions of Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II (saralasin, 10 micrograms/kg-1/min-1) similarly reduced blood pressure of both intact and anephric SHR. These results indicate that captopril and saralasin lower blood pressure in the SHR by some mechanism(s) independent of the kidneys, circulating renin, or bradykinin potentiation. It is suggested that angiotensin II, locally produced at some critical tissue site(s), is involved in the maintenance of raised blood pressure in SHR.", 
    "29": "There are very few areas of clinical pharmacology being pursued as vigorously as hypertension. Numerous new drugs are being discovered and tested both in United States and overseas. The most promising new antihypertensive drugs seem to fall into the angiotensin-renin blocker group and those affecting the sodium-volume axis in hypertensive patients. We can look forward to newer agents that are efficacious as monotherapy and on a daily or twice daily dosage regimen for the treatment of the vast majority of hypertensive patients. There is further hope that preoperative evaluation with angiotensin blockers in patients with renovascular hypertension may improve the predictability of successful renal bypass surgery.", 
    "30": "The potent converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) SQ14,225, which is known to prevent the formation of angiotensin II (AII) has been used to evaluate the role of AII in the development and reversal of cardiac hypertrophy. The present study describes the effect of CEI on blood pressure (BP) and myocardial hypertrophy (prevention and reversal) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). A group of 3-week- and 8-week-old male SHR was treated with CEI (30 mg/kg in drinking water) for 6 weeks. An additional group of SHR was also treated with a combination of CEI and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, 500 mg/liter). Heart weight, BP, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), hydroxyproline, myocardial catecholamines, and plasma renin activity (PRA) were determined. In the prevention study, we found a significant reduction in the ratio of heart weight to body weight along with the prevention of hypertension (200 vs 145 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Similar reductions in BP and heart weights were obtained with the reversal group. A better BP control was noted in the CEI and hydrochlorothiazide group. The reduction of heart weight was associated with a reduction in RNA and hydroxyproline content. In all groups, we found a significant increase in PRA (p less than 0.001) and a slight increase in tissue catecholamine concentration. No change in kidney weight was found in any group. Data clearly showed that oral administration of CEI prevented and reversed cardiac hypertrophy in SHR. Reversal was associated with a decrease in myocardial collagen content. These data indicate that prevention of AII formation in combination with BP control can prevent and reverse cardiac hypertrophy in SHR. Of course, whether or not CEI acts only through the renin angiotension system is still speculative.", 
    "31": "Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, was administered twice daily to 13 hypertensive patients for a mean period of 9 weeks. Continuous blood pressure control in the ambulatory patients was established with a portable blood pressure recorder. Notwithstanding, in eight patients with normal renal function, plasma converting enzyme was found to resume normal activity before administration of the morning dose of captopril. Only in 5 patients with impaired renal function did some blockade of plasma converting enzyme persist for more than 12 hours. Measured plasma converting enzyme activity seemed to reflect total conversion of angiotensin I, including conversion in the pulmonary vascular bed, since changes in its activity were closely paralled by changes in plasma aldosterone levels. Bradykinin accumulation seems unlikely when converting enzyme and thus, presumably, kininase II has resumed normal activity. Captopril administration does not seem to alter plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine levels. Blood pressure reduction in the face of normal angiotensin converting enzyme activity is probably due to hyporesponsiveness of the arterioles to pressor hormones, which may be due to specific renin-related and/or nonspecific effects of captopril.", 
    "32": "Hemodynamic parameters were studied before and after administration of SQ 14 225, an orally active converting enzyme inhibitor, in 6 sustained essential hypertensive patients. Blood pressure and total peripheral resistance significantly decreased while cardiac output and heart rate remained unchanged. Systolic time intervals and plasma volume were not modified. No correlation was observed between the basal value of plasma renin activity and the decrease in blood pressure. The study demonstrated the vasodilatator effect of SQ 14 225 and questionned the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the mechanism of the pressure decrease.", 
    "33": "Randomised, double-blind cross-over trials were performed in seven anephric patients to determine the effect of the orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on blood pressure in fluid-depleted and fluid-replete patients. Patients were given captopril, 100 mg orally, or placebo one hour after haemodialysis, when they were fluid depleted. Their mean (+/- SEM) supine blood pressure fell from 127 +/- 12/71 +/- 6 mm Hg before captopril to 106 +/- 13/54 +/- 4 mm Hg 24 hours after the drug, while on placebo it rose from 123 +/- 11/73 +/- 5 mm Hg to 134 +/- 10/82 +/- 8 mm Hg. All patients developed orthostatic hypotension after captopril. In the fluid-replete state, two days after haemodialysis, captopril had no effect on blood pressure. The plasma concentration of active renin was extremely low and did not rise after fluid withdrawal or captopril. Thus the hypotensive effect of captopril did not appear to depend on circulating renin concentrations. The concept of \"renin-dependent\" hypertension, which is responsive to captopril, as opposed to \"volume-dependent\" hypertension, which is not responsive to captopril, may therefore be invalid.", 
    "34": "The present study compared the hemodynamic effects of captopril with those of guanethidine as well as with a combination of these two drugs in conscious male spontaneously hypertensive rats. Acutely, captopril or guanethidine or a combination of the two lowered arterial pressure to similar levels. The reduction in pressure with captopril alone or in combination with guanethidine, was due to a lowering of all organ vascular resistances. Guanethidine alone lowered pressure by reducing cardiac output. Chronically, captopril or guanethidine lowered arterial pressure to similar levels by reducing organ vascular resistances to comparable levels, particularly skeletal muscle, skin and splanchnic organs. Combination of these two drugs had an additive effect on the reduction of arterial pressure and organ vascular resistances. Since, chronically, the addition of guanethidine to captopril therapy enhanced rather than attenuated the hemodynamic changes induced by captopril, these drugs are probably acting by different mechanisms and the mechanisms of action of captopril does not require an intact sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "35": "The quantitation of captopril in biological fluids by gas-liquid chromatography using a flame photometric detector is described. Captopril was converted into an adduct with N-ethylmaleimide and then into the hexafluoroisopropyl ester. The latter derivative was separated on a 2% OV-210 column and determined by employing the captopril-N-hexylmaleimide adduct as an internal standard. The blood level and urinary excretion of captopril administered intravenously to dogs were measured by the proposed method.", 
    "36": "The effect of inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis by captopril on the response of plasma ADH to the osmotic and volume-dependent stimuli has been studied in 15 uremic patients. Captopril administration had no effect either on basal plasma ADH or on plasma ADH response to the osmotic stimulus. Time-course of plasma ADH following hypertonic saline administration and sensitivity of the response (increase of plasma ADH related to increase of plasma sodium) were not modified. On the contrary, the response of plasma ADH to the volume-dependent stimulus induced by hemofiltration was markedly blunted by captopril administration. The sensitivity estimated from the slope of the regression line relating plasma ADH to the cumulated lost volume was clearly diminished. These results suggest that angiotensin II mediates ADH response only to the volume-dependent stimulus.", 
    "37": "We report the use of the orally active converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril in hypertensive patients with mild chronic renal failure. Twenty eight patients were followed for a period of six months. Eleven patients required the addition of furosemide. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased in all but two at six months (MAP: 102 +/- 0.8 vs 133 +/- 2.2mmHg, p less than 0.001). Untoward effects were frequent: the commonest reactions are loss of taste (four patients), skin rashes (11 patients), proteinuria (2 patients), tachycardia (2 cases). These side effects disappeared after reduction of dose (10 cases) or withdrawal (8 cases). Patients on 300mg daily or less were free of any untoward effect. In summary (i) Captopril alone or in combination with furosemide has an antihypertensive effect in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension; (ii) side effects seem to be dose dependant and a reduced dosage should be used in these patients.", 
    "38": "In conscious sodium-deficient dogs, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and angiotensin II receptor blockade with an angiotensin II inhibitory analogue reduced arterial blood pressure and increased urinary sodium excretion significantly, but the hypotensive and natriuretic response was considerably greater during inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme with captopril. Angiotensin II infusion (3 ng/kg/min) into sodium-deficient dogs maintained on captopril administration restored arterial blood pressure, urinary sodium excretion, and plasma aldosterone concentration to levels that existed in untreated sodium-deficient dogs. This indicates that the hypotensive and natriuretic actions of captopril are due to the inhibition of angiotensin II formation and not to the accumulation of the vasodepressor peptide, bradykinin.", 
    "39": "The effect of an oral angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14225 (Captopril) on blood pressure and plasma renin activity (PRA) was studied in deoxycorticosterone-salt (DOCA/salt) hypertensive rats. Intraperitoneal (ip) injection of captopril (1 mg/kg) produced a significant fall in systolic blood pressure (23.4 +/- 5.0 mm Hg, p < 0.001) whereas no significant change in blood pressure occurred in control rats. Indomethacin (IDM) (2.5 mg/kg ip) pretreatment significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated the hypotensive action of captopril in DOCA/salt rats. PRA was markedly suppressed in DOCA/salt rats (0.3 +/- 0.1 ng/ml/hr) when compared with the normotensive controls (4.4 +/- 2.2 ng/ml/hr, p < 0.001) at baseline. Captopril induced a significant rise in PRA in both groups of rats. These responses were not significantly altered by IDM pretreatment. The hypotensive effect of captopril in the DOCA/salt model may be mediated by prostaglandins since their synthesis is inhibited by indomethacin.", 
    "40": "Captopril (100mg/kg) administered daily by gavage to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) from their 6th to 20th weeks of age almost completely inhibited genetic hypertension development (GHD). This effect was correlated with an early and long-lasting limitation of the progressive increase in peripheral resistance which normally develops in SHRs during their growth. Heart rate, cardiac and systolic indexes remained unchanged, plasma renin concentration was significantly increased and heart weight/body weight ratio was significantly decreased. At last, captopril's GHD preventive effect persisted up to 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation.", 
    "41": "This case report describes a patient with essential hypertension in whom captopril during seven months resulted in a nephrotic syndrome. A renal biopsy specimen revealed membranous glomerulopathy stage I. After withdrawal of the drug, urinary protein loss disappeared within ten days. However, a second biopsy three months later still showed granular deposition of IgA, IgG, IgM and C3 in the glomerular basement membrane and unchanged subepithelial electron-dense deposits on electron microscopy. Glomerular filtration rate remained normal during the observation period.", 
    "42": "The present investigation demonstrates that chronic intrarenal PGE2 infusion results in a PRA-induced increase in arterial pressure. This conclusion is supported by an 8-fold rise in PRA and the marked reduction of arterial pressure during saralasin and CEI infusion. If the chronic effects of endogenously released PGE2 are similar to arterial administration, then the net effect of chronically elevated renal PGE2 in the dog appears to be a moderate, sustained hypertension.", 
    "43": "1. Removal of the renal artery constriction but not of the clipped kidney restored the blood pressure to normal levels in Goldblatt two-kidney rats with hypertension of more than 4 months' duration. 2. Despite the differences in blood pressure response, both surgical procedures lowered plasma renin concentration to normal or below normal values. 3. Administration of the oral converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14 225 produced a marked fall in blood pressure in Goldblatt kidney rats with chronic hypertension. However, a prolonged infusion of the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin was quite ineffective. The difference in response to the two inhibitors may have been due to bradykinin potentiation by the converting enzyme inhibitor. 4. Although plasma renin is often elevated in Goldblatt two-kidney rats with hypertension of more than 4 months' duration, the renin-angiotensin system plays no role in the maintenance of blood pressure at this stage.", 
    "44": "1. The peptide converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was given (1.25 mg/kg intravenously) to normal and nephrectomized rats and rats with renovascular and deoxycorticosterone hypertension. 2. Captopril lowered blood pressure to a small extent in normal and nephrectomized rats. Bradykinin infusion in nephrectomized animals, however, potentiated the vasodepressor action of captopril. 3. Captopril produced a major blood pressure fall in the early stages of Goldblatt two-kidney one-clip hypertension: even when hypertension had been present for more than 4 months, a substantial vasodepressor action was seen. Rats with deoxycorticosterone-induced hypertension also showed a significant blood pressure fall. 4. Captopril was given to salt-loaded and salt-depleted rats in which the renin-angiotensin system had been blocked by infusion of the competitive angiotensin II antagonist saralasin. Captopril still lowered blood pressure in the salt-depleted group. 5. Captopril lowers blood pressure in situations where the renin-angiotensin system is not responsible for blood pressure maintenance. Further, the fall in blood pressure produced in Goldblatt two-kidney one-clip hypertension is greater than would be predicted on the basis of renin-angiotensin blockade. It is likely therefore that captopril lowers blood pressure by an action additional to angiotensin blockade. Bradykinin potentiation is one possible mechanism by which this may take place.", 
    "45": "The early blood pressure and hemodynamic effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), captopril, were compared in 23 hypertensive patients with those of a specific angiotensin II antagonist (AA), [Sar1, Thr8] A II. AA reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 10 mm Hg only in seven of 23 patients vs 15 of 23 who responded to CEI (p less than 0.02). With both drugs, changes in MAP were not associated with significant changes in cardiac output (p greater than 0.10 for both drugs), but correlated with changes in systemic resistance (TPR); r = 0.84, p less than 0.001 for AA and r = 0.71, p less than 0.001 for CEI. Changes in TPR and MAP correlated significantly and inversely with log plasma renin activity in both instances; for AA, r = 0.829 and for CEI, r = -0.737; p less than 0.001 for both. The slopes of the two regression lines were not significantly different but the intercepts were +8.47 mm Hg for AA vs -10.17 mm Hg for CEI (p less than 0.001). This quantitative difference in response could be attributed either to an agonistic effect of [Sar1, Thr8] A II or to an additional vasodilator effect of captopril.", 
    "46": "1. The preventive effects against genetic hypertension development (GHD) of seven antihypertensive drugs chronically administered to the young SHRs from their 5th to their 13th week of age have been investigated. 2. While prazosin (20 mg/kg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6,5 and 25 mg/kg) are ineffective and while YC 93, a calcium-antagonist (10, 30, 100 mg/kg) exerts only a slight protective effect, captopril (30 and 100 mg/kg), dihydralazine (25 mg/kg) and atenolol (200 mg/kg) strongly prevent GHD. 3. Captopril and dihydralazine oppose GHD by inhibiting the progressive increase in peripheral resistance (PR) which normally occurs with ageing in SHRs. Simultaneously, these two drugs do not affect the cardiac output (CO) but increase plasma renin concentration (PRC). On the other hand, atenolol opposes GHD mainly by reducing CO and PRC while it simultaneously reinforces the progressive increase of PR with age. Captopril and atenolol, unlike dihydralazine, limit SHRs' myocardial hypertrophy. 4. After 14 weeks of treatment, arterial blood pressure (BP) of dihydralazine - and atenolol-treated animals meets control animals BP within 4 weeks whereas captopril preventive effects are still present up to 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Wit atenolol and captopril ther is after treatment discontinuation a good correlation between the evolution of heart weight/body weight and BP, which suggests that captopril could temporarily oppose the myocardial structural alterations which usually accompany GHD.", 
    "47": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was purified about 7000 times from human lung tissue obtained at thoracotomy. After solubilization with Triton X-100 and sonication, ion exchange DEAE cellulose chromatography and Sepharose 4B gel filtration were performed. After gel filtration a 5-6 fold increase in purity was achieved by neuraminidase treatment of the protein and recycling over DEAE cellulose. Purity was established in SDS electrophoresis and on electrofocusing 125I-labelled purified protein and these procedures indicated a molecular weight of about 150,000 and pI value of 4.5, respectively. The purified protein split Angiotensin I and this action was inhibited by Captopril (Squibb 14,225), specific inhibitor of ACE (kininase II). The Km value for the synthetic substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine was 3.7 X 10(-4) mol/l. The IC50 of Captopril when inhibiting human lung ACE action on the same substrate, was 4.5 X 10(-9) mol/l.", 
    "48": "There are at least two types of enzymes in brain, endopeptidases and aminopeptidases, which metabolize enkephalins. Evidence is presented to suggest that enkephalinase, an endopeptidase cleaving at the Gly-Phe bond, is specific for the endogenous enkephalinergic system. Selective inhibitors are described for each enzyme. These are parachloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and puromycin in the case of aminopeptidases and various enkephalin fragments in the case of enkephalinase. Some characteristics of the two types of enzymes are described. Enkephalinase has many properties in common with the well-characterized brain angiotensin-converting enzyme. These two enzymes, however, behaved differently when tested for chloride dependence, for activity in several buffers and for susceptibility to specific inhibitors.", 
    "49": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme, the peptidase hydrolysing angiotensin I to angiotensin II and first discovered in plasma, has been demonstrated in lung tissue on the luminal surface of endothelial cells lining pulmonary blood vessels. Because converting enzyme is the final activating step in the renin-angiotensin system its inhibition prevents the pressor and other effects of increased renin secretion. Lung converting enzyme activity is inhibited specifically by a nonapeptide (BPP9a:SQ 20 881) contained in Bothrops jararaca venom. This peptide inhibits the pressor effects of injected angiotensin I in humans and lowers blood pressure in patients with high-renin hypertension. Recently a synthetic inhibitor, captopril, was devised which is effective, given orally, in reducing the blood pressure of high-renin hypertensives and of a proportion of hypertensives with normal renin levels. The latter finding suggests that blood pressure may be maintained by renin-dependent mechanisms without increased renin secretion.", 
    "50": "A synthetic orally active angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril (Squibb), (D-2-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl-L-Proline), was administered to three groups of hypertensive animals. The animals were made hypertensive by uninephrectomy, daily injections of 5 ug/100 g body weight d-aldosterone (Sigma) in wheat germ oil and substitution of 0.9% NaCl for the drinking water. Captopril was given to pregnant and nonpregnant animals during the developmental phase of hypertension and to nonpregnant animals with established (4 weeks of treatment) hypertension. The agent attenuated the hypertension in both the pregnant and nonpregnant animals when given while hypertension was developing. Captopril was effective in reducing established aldosterone-NaCl hypertension to normotensive levels.", 
    "51": "Human pulmonary endothelial cells were used to study the metabolism of angiotensin I and bradykinin by angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II; ACE). The endothelial cells cultured from pulmonary arteries and veins differed with respect to their enzyme activity and their surface structure, as viewed with scanning electron microscopy. Cells from adult pulmonary arteries had greater ACE activity than cells from either adult pulmonary veins or fetal pulmonary arteries. In addition, cells from adult pulmonary arteries exhibited more prominent surface projections than cells from veins or fetal pulmonary arteries. A brief exposure to trypsin decreased the ACE activity in cells from arteries but not in cells from veins. Possible the differences in ACE activity between these cells are related to their surface structures.", 
    "52": "Thirty-nine patients with various types of hypertension were treated by chronic blockage of the angiotensin converting enzyme, i.e. by twice daily administration of captopril, 50 to 200 mg p.o. The blood pressure reduction observed 1 hour following administration of the inhibitor was directly related to the baseline plasma renin activity (r=- 0.67, p < 0.001). Whenever blockade of the renin system alone did not lower blood pressure to normal levels additional sodium subtraction brought it under control. With the renin system neutralized, blood pressure becomes exquisitely sensitive to changes in sodium balance. Diuretics seem to preserve optimal natriuretic efficacy despite blood pressure reduction, probably because aldosterone levels are reduced and renal blood flow increases. Blockade of the renin system together with individually tailored salt subtraction provides an attractive new approach to long-term treatment of clinical hypertension.", 
    "53": "Recent research has shown that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a role in maintaining or causing high blood pressure in the majority of patients and it has demonstrated that renin-sodium profiling defines this involvement. Plasma renin activity measurements reveal the degree of renin-mediated vasoconstriction supporting the blood pressure, and the urinary sodium value indicates the appropriateness of the renin activity to the volume status. Together with determination of serum potassium levels, this test is basic for screening and for definitive diagnosis of the surgically curable forms of renovascular and adrenocortical hypertension. For the remaining majority of patients with other forms of hypertension, renin profiling, used in the context of the vaso-constriction-volume analytical model, helps to reveal the relative participation of vasoconstriction and volume factors and it thereby guides simpler, more specific, and more predictable treatments using either antirenin or antivolume agents. In particular, renin profiling allows the physician to select those patients who should first receive a beta-blocker or a newer anti-renin drug instead of a diuretic. The vasoconstriction-volume analysis also can provide useful baseline information about the pace, severity, and prognosis of the disease in individual patients. For medical practice the new approach enables treatment with one drug instead of two for major subgroups, and the likelihood of more specific physiologic corrections. More research within this framework promises even better treatments as we near final solutions.", 
    "54": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of one-clip, two-kidney hypertension has been studied in man, dog and rat. Particular attention has been paid to peripheral plasma concentrations of angiotensin II in different circumstances; angiotensin II infusion has been combined with radioimmunoassay to construct angiotensin II/blood pressure dose-response curves. The effect of converting enzyme inhibitors has been studied, precautions being taken to avoid obtaining falsely high values for plasma angiotensin II because of cross-reaction with angiotensin I in these circumstances. The initial phase of one-clip, two-kidney hypertension is attributable to the direct pressor effect of the immediate rise in plasma angiotensin II. Subsequently, plasma angiotensin II is relatively lower, although blood pressure remains high. This upward resetting of the plasma angiotensin II/blood pressure relationship can be mimicked by infusing angiotensin II chronically at low dose. After reconstruction of a stenosed renal artery, or excision of a post-stenotic kidney, the angiotensin II/blood pressure relationship returns slowly to normal. In this second phase of one-clip, two-kidney hypertension, the long-term administration of saralasin, or of converting enzyme inhibitor, can also return arterial pressure to normal; brief administration of these drugs is less effective or ineffective. The results are compatible with, although they do not conclusively establish, an important slow pressor action of the renin-angiotensin system in the second phase of one-clip, two-kidney hypertension. This provides a rational basis for the use of captopril clinically in this condition.", 
    "55": "Captopril was given orally to 24 patients with moderate to severe essential or renovascular hypertension, with variable degrees of sodium-volume depletion. Initiation of treatment resulted in orthostatic hypotension in 5 and in symptoms and signs of hypotension while still recumbent in 4; bradycardia accompanied the adverse hypotension which was relieved by iv atropine. After iv infusion of 1-2 liters of 0.9% NaCl patients cound resume their normal activities and be treated with captopril. The development of hypotension was related to the prevailing plasma renin level, which was partly determined by the degree of sodium-depletion and the aetiology of hypertension. The degree of sodium-depletion, the aetiology and severity of hypertension and heart rate did not contribute independently from plasma renin activity to the development of hypotension.", 
    "56": "Protein content, enzymatic activites and Ca2+ accumulation capacities were studied in plasma membrane fractions isolated from mesenteric arteries of rats made hypertensive by renal artery stenosis with and without contralateral nephrectomy, i.e., one-kidney, one clip (1-KHR) and two-kidney, one clip (2-KHR) hypertension, respectively. Both types of renovascular hypertension showed similar vascular plasma membrane abnormalities which included increased total protein contents, enhanced alkaline phosphatase activities and reduced ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation compared to control values. The altered alkaline phosphatase activity and ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation appeared to be associated with blood pressure elevation in both types of hypertension and may be related to the elevation of blood pressure insensitive to captopril (SQ 14,225) in 1-KHR and 2-KHR. These results are consistent with the current concept of biochemical abnormalities of arterial smooth muscle in the development ostem.", 
    "57": "Administration of potent vasodepressor agents such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, may precipitate myocardial ischemic events in patients with coronary artery disease, particularly if this treatment is preceded by a discontinuation of beta-blocking drugs such as propranolol. In one case studied, a patient experienced three episodes of angina pectoris under these conditions; in another, acute anterior myocardial infarction was suspect.", 
    "58": "In order to assess the role of angiotensin in the genesis of certain types of thirst, rats were administered the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, in an attempt to block the increased water intake induced either by water deprivation or by i.p. administration of hypertonic saline. Water deprivation for 24 hr resulted in an increased water intake. Acute administration of 50 mg of captopril per kg i.p. at 45 or 60, but not at 15 or 30, min before return of water to the dehydrated rats significantly attenuated the drinking response. Rats administered 1% b.wt. i.p. of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00 M NaCl solution increased proportionately their water intake. Acute administration of 35 mg of captopril per kg b. wt. i.p. 15 min before loading with NaCl solution at any of the above concentrations had no effect on the increased thirst induced. These findings suggest that hypertonic saline-induced thirst is not mediated by angiotensin II receptors while water deprivation-induced thirst may involve both osmoreceptors and angiotensin II receptors.", 
    "59": "1 The effects of intravenous infusion of angiotensin I, II and (des-1-Asp) angiotensin II (angiotensin III) on the plasma vasopressin levels, with and without converting enzyme inhibition, were investigated in conscious rats by use of a specific radioimmunoassay. 2 All three peptides caused a dose-dependent increase in vasopressin release, angiotensin III infusion being less effective than angiotensin I or II. 3 The converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20881 (Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.), had no effect on the plasma vasopressin concentrations in bilaterally nephrectomized rats, but increased them in intact or sham-operated animals. 4 SQ 20881 potentiated vasopressin release, elicited by angiotensin I, leaving that elicited by angiotensin II unchanged. The receptor antagonist, saralasin, prevented the angiotensin-induced increase in plasma vasopressin concentration, even after pretreatment with SQ 20881. 5 These data support the assumption that the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the control of vasopressin release, and indicate that in addition to angiotensin II, angiotensin I and III may also contribute, acting in concert.", 
    "60": "Neutral thiol-activated peptidases present in the pH 5-soluble fraction of rabbit brain (separated by step-elution chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose) were screened for the hydrolysis of bradykinin. Lys-bradykinin, Met-Lys-bradykinin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, substance P, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), and neurotensin by bioassay. The column effluent was monitored for bradykinin inactivation and arylamidase activity and combined in six pools on the basis of bradykinin inactivation. The pools were characterized by determining the peptide fragments and amino acids released from bradykinin with an amino acid analyzer. Pools 1 through 3 contained 80% of the kininase activity and essentially all of the endopeptidase A and B activity, whereas pools 4 through 6 accounted for 98% of the recovered arylamidase activity. Bradykinin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and substance P were inactivated by all the pools, whereas LH-RH and neurotensin were inactivated by pools 3 and 4, and pools 3, 4, and 5, respectively. These data show that rabbit brain contains peptidases having some selectivity for the inactivation of neuropeptides. Endopeptidase B purified from pool 3 is inhibited by bradykinin-potentiating peptide 9a (BPP9a, SQ 20881) (< Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro), a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of bradykinin (Km = 3.5 X 10(-5) M, Ki = 3 X 10(-6) M) which also completely inhibits the inactivation of LH-RH.", 
    "61": "The effects of minoxidil and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14,225 on blood pressure, sodium balance, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, aldosterone excretion rate, and renal function were studied in 11 drug-resistant hypertensive patients under controlled diets of sodium and potassium intake. Minoxidil treatment lowered blood pressure from 178/112 +/- 8/5 mm Hg (means +/- SEM) to 14/95 +/- 6/3 mm Hg. Plasma renin activity rose from 4.8 +/- 1.7 ng/ml/hr to 9.9 +/- 2.4; plasma aldosterone rose from 32.6 +/- 7.4 to 50.5 +/- 9.8 ng/dl; and aldosterone excretion rate rose from 7.6 +/- 1.3 to 15.2 +/- 3.5 micrograms/24 hr. Sodium retention could be controlled by increasing doses of diuretics, but a 10 mEq/day sodium intake in two patients resulted in significant increases of serum creatinine, and hyperkalemia was reversed by sodium loading. In five minoxidil-treated patients, substitution with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14,225 lowered plasma and urinary aldosterone levels in two normal and high-renin patients but not significantly in three low-renin patients. Sodium excretion increased when aldosterone decreased, but blood pressure were more consistently controlled with minoxidil than with oral SQ 14,225.", 
    "62": "Whilst plasma renin values are elevated in a minority of patients with essential hypertension, there is no indication that high renin hypertension is a distinct entity and even where renin levels are elevated, they are usually less than those observed in renovascular hypertension. It is still possible for the renin-angiotensin system to be important, if blood pressure is maintained by renin activity within the arterial or arteriolar walls. Accordingly, renin-like activity or rat aortic wall homogenate and plasma renin concentrations were measured simultaneously. Both plasma and aortic renin (measured with an incubation pH of 6.5) rose in salt-depleted and fell in salt-loaded rats. Both were elevated in Goldblatt 2-kidney hypertension. However, aortic renin fell gradually over 24 h after bilateral nephrectomy, whilst plasma renin had reached its nadir by 1 h. To assess the importance of arterial as opposed to plasma renin the renin-angiotensin system was blocked with the converting enzyme inhibitor Sq20881. A blood pressure fall attributable to renin-angiotensin blockade could be demonstrated for at least 6 h after bilateral nephrectomy. This supports the hypothesis that renin in the arterial and arteriolar wall, rather than plasma renin, is responsible for blood pressure maintenance. Nevertheless, in steady state conditions such as essential hypertension, plasma and arterial renin are closely related.", 
    "63": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) upon blood pressure and plasma aldosterone (PA) were studied in rabbits with a simultaneous infusion of angiotensin I (ANG I) or with hemorrhagic hypotension. Pretreatment with CEI (SQ 20881), 1.0 mg/Kg, inhibited the effects of infused ANG I, 30 ng/Kg/min, upon PA and blood pressure at 30 min of the infusion, but the inhibition on PA was not significant at 60 min of the infusion. The same dose of CEI was ineffective in blocking the effect of 100 ng/Kg/min of ANG I on PA and blood pressure even at 30 min of the infusion. In rabbits with hemorrhagic hypotension, injection of CEI resulted in the decrement in blood pressure, whereas no decrement in blood pressure was observed in normal control rabbits. This study suggests that CEI exerts it's effect in part by inhibiting conversion of ANG I to angiotensin II (ANG II), but this can't exclude other mechanisms.", 
    "64": "The fat of less than Glu1-3H-labelled bradykinin-potentiating peptide 9a [BPP9a; less than Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (peptidyl dipeptidase)] was studied in the rabbit. After intravenous injection, BPP9a was rapidly removed from blood and much of the associated radioactivity was excreted in urine. Approx. 8% of the radioactivity in urine collected 2h after drug administration occurred in the form of BPP9a itself, the remainder occurring in three lower homologues: less than Glu-Trp (60%), less Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln (20%) and less than Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile (12%). Hydrolysis was not accounted for by enzymes in blood or urine. Apparently hydrolysis occurred within the kidney, as less than Gl-Trp was obtained in 60% yield in urine of isolated rat kidney perfused with [less than Glu1-3H]BPP9a.", 
    "65": "The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulates arterial pressure (AP) and renal function during chronic sodium deprivation. Intravenous infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225 (14 microgram.kg-1.mm-1) for 8 days in 12 sodium-deficient dogs caused a marked decrease in AP from 90 +/- 1 to 67 +/- 2 mmHg and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), filtration fraction (FF), and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). Despite the fall in AP and GFR, urinary Na excretion and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased above control levels. In four dogs, infusion of aldosterone (200 micrograms/day) for 8 days during continuous SQ 14225 infusion restored PAC to levels above control, but did not significantly change AP or renal function from the values observed during SQ 14225 infusion alone. However, infusion of angiotensin II (AII) (10 or 20 ng.kg-1.min-1) for 5--8 days during continuous SQ 14225 infusion almost completely restored AP and renal function to control levels. These data indicate that the RAS plays a major role in regulating AP, renal hemodynamics, and Na excretion during Na deprivation, probably through the direct effects of AII rather than through changes in PAC.", 
    "66": "Indirect systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored in male, weanling, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) maintained on water for 16 weeks (group A) or on captopril therapy (100 mg/kg/day in drinking water) for 4 (group B), 8 (group C), 12 (group D), 16 (group E) weeks. Weanling SHR of group A developed typical, time-related hypertension over a 16-week observation period. In marked contrast, SHR receiving captopril did not develop hypertension. Discontinuation of captopril after 4, 8, 12 or 16 weeks resulted in the usual development of hypertension. There was a transient increase in water consumption of drug treated rats which returned to normal by 8 weeks of dosing. Conversely, when captopril therapy was discontinued after 4, 8 or 12 weeks, there was a transient decrease in water intake, the magnitude of which was inversely related to the duration of drug therapy. These results demonstrate that daily captopril therapy was able to completely prevent the development of spontaneous hypertension. Explanations for the mechanism(s) underlying the influence of captopril on blood pressure and water intake remain speculative.", 
    "67": "Captopril (SQ 14,225), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was used in combination with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, in the treatment of mild and moderate hypertension. A significant decrease in blood presure was obtained (P less than 0.05). The maximum oral dose of captopril was 450 mg daily and the maximum oral dosage of propranolol was 360 mg daily. Side-effects were negligible and transitory. They consisted of skin rashes and pain in the calves (1 patient) and palpitations (1 patient) on captopril and skin rashes (1 patient) on propranolol. Captopril is a promising new hypotensive agent and is efficacious in combination with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "68": "1. The response of arterial blood pressure, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration to inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) with captopril has been studied in patients with severe, treatment-resistant, malignant hypertension. 2. Nine patients with a past history of severe hypertension, supine diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg before conventional antihypertensive therapy and resistant to conventional antihypertensive therapy were studied. 3. Captopril administration resulted in a marked decrease in arterial blood pressure and plasma aldosterone concentration and an increase in plasma renin activity. 4. Although arterial blood pressure remained significantly below the values observed during the control period, pressure did tend to increase again after 3 days. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide kept arterial pressure significantly below pretreatment control values.", 
    "69": "1. Captopril (25 mg) reduced plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) by 53% (P less than 0.001) and mean brachial artery pressure (MBAP) by 18.7 mmHg (P less than 0.001) within 75 min in 26 hypertensive patients. After 2 months (on 150-600 mg/day) MBAP had decreased by 27.1 mmHg (n = 18) with no further change of plasma ANG II. delta MBAP was significantly related to control log plasm renin (PRA) and log ANG II in both conditions. 2. The acute depressor response to captopril was 11.2 mmHg greater (P less than 0.001) than delta MBAP during saralasin infusion (n = 12). 3. Heart rate slightly increased after acute administration of captopril (+3.3 beats/min; P less than 0.005), but cardiac output was not significantly affected; systemic vascular resistance decreased by 10% (P less than 0.01) with unchanged pulmonary vascular resistance. 4. During chronic administration, oxygen consumption, cardiac output and stroke volume increased by 15% (P less than 0.01), with unchanged heart rate; systemic vascular resistance had dropped by 30% (P less than 0.001). 5. Plasma ANG II and plasma aldosterone decreased, and PRA and ANG I increased acutely, with no further changes during chronic treatment.", 
    "70": "1. Captopril (100 mg/kg, orally) decreased blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. 2. Bilateral adrenalectomy either before or after captopril administration did not alter the antihypertensive effect of captopril. 3. Bilateral nephrectomy reversed the established antihypertensive effect of captopril and prevented any change in blood pressure to a subsequent dose of captopril. 4. It is concluded that kidneys but not adrenal glands are essential to the antihypertensive actions of captopril in SH rats.", 
    "71": "1. The effect of acute inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by captopril (50 mg) on renal haemodynamics and function was assessed in nine patients with essential hypertension on unrestricted sodium intake (n = 8) or low sodium diet (n = 1). 2. Captopril induced a rapid and significant decrease in arterial pressure, which was maximal within 60 min. 3. Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not change and filtration fraction (FF) decreased after captopril. No change in sodium excretion and a decrease in urinary potassium occurred. 4. In the patient on low sodium diet, captopril induced striking increases in GFR and ERPF (64 and 106% respectively). 5. The logarithm of baseline plasma renin activity was positvely correlated with the change in ERPF and negatively correlated with changes in FF and renal resistance. 6. The results indicate that in patients with essential hypertension angiotensin participates actively in the maintenance of renal vascular tone at the efferent arteriolar level. A possible influence of kinins remains to be defined.", 
    "72": "1. Saralasin and converting enzyme inhibitors SQ 20881 and captopril induced increases in plasma renin activity to greater than 14 ng h-1 ml-1 in 43 out of 44 patients with untreated renovascular hypertension when studied in the seated position and on normal sodium intake. This degree of response was absent in patients with normal-renin essential hypertension and present in only three out of 26 with high-renin essential hypertension. 2. Reductions of greater than approximately 9% in diastolic pressure in response to these three drugs occurred regularly in renovascular hypertension (95%) but also frequently in high-renin (65%) and normal-renin (26%) essential hypertension. 3. Prior sodium depletion abolished the specificity of the renin and depressor responses to angiotensin blockage for renovascular hypertension. 4. Some patients with bilateral renovascular and all with malignant hypertension also exhibited these responses to angiotensin blockade that are characteristic of unilateral renovascular hypertension.", 
    "73": "1. The effects of long-term treatment with the angiotensin I converting-enzyme inhibitor YS 980 were examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (sp-SH) rats. Development of hypertension was markedly blunted in the YS 980-treated animals. 2. Effective converting-enzyme inhibition was confirmed by significant increases in plasma angiotensin I (ANG I) and plasma renin concentration, inhibition of the pressor responses to intravenous ANG I and potentiation of the depressor responses to intravenous bradykinin. 3. Urinary free aldosterone excretion was decreased but no changes in urinary sodium and potassium excretion were observed. 4. The pressor responses to intravenous leucine-enkephalin were reduced. 5. The pressor responses to injection of ANG I and bradykinin into the lateral brain ventricle were unaltered. 6. We conclude that the antihypertensive action of YS 980 in sp-SH rats cannot be explained by the inhibition of the plasma renin-angiotensin system alone. Effects on other peptide systems must be considered.", 
    "74": "1. Renin-associated, chronic psychosocial hypertension of 150-160 mmHg develops in groups of mice interacting socially in complex population cages. 2. The blood pressures of 16 males in a cage were measured and an intraperitoneal injection of the angiotensin coverting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14,225) was given. Three hours later blood pressures were measured again. 3. During the first 3 weeks of psychosocial hypertension SQ 14,225 was without effect. But at 1 month and subsequently up to 7 months, SQ 14,225 reduced blood pressure to the normal range of 120-130 mmHg. 4. Plasma renin activities were not related to the extent of blood pressure reduction by SQ 14,225. Hence other factors in addition to the renin-angiotensin mechanism play a part in maintaining chronic psychosocial hypertension.", 
    "75": "1. Captopril was shown to be as effective as hydrochlorothiazide in lowering the blood pressure in patients with moderately severe essential hypertension. 2. With the combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide satisfactory control of blood pressure was maintained over 8 months. 3. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by captopril in man was associated with falls in plasma angiotensin II and urinary aldosterone and rises in angiotensin I and plasma renin. 4. No change in venous concentrations of bradykinin could be demonstrated during therapy. 5. Captopril attenuated the hyperaldosteronism and hypokalaemia associated with diuretic therapy.", 
    "76": "A group of active-site metal coordinating inhibitors of zinc proteases (carboxypeptidase A, thermolysin, Bacillus cereus neutral protease, and angiotensin-converting enzyme) have been synthesized and their properties investigated. Their general structures are R-SH and R-NH-PO2(O phi)H, where-S- or -O- serve as metal ligands and R refers to an amino acid or peptide group designed to interact with substrate recognition sites. These inhibitors can be extremely potent; thus, N-(2-mercaptoacetyl)-D-phenylalanine, e.g., inhibits carboxypeptidase A with a Kiapp of 2.2 x 10(-7) M. The spectral response of cobalt(II)-substituted thermolysin or carboxypeptidase A to the sulfur-containing inhibitors signals the direct interaction of the mercaptan with the metal. An S leads to Co(II) charge transfer band is generated near 340 nm and is detected by absorption, circular dichroism, and magnetic circular dichroism. The cobalt(II) spectra indicate both inner sphere coordination with sulfur and 4-coordination in the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Thus, the metal undergoes a simple substitution reaction, the inhibitor most likely displacing water at the fourth coordination site.", 
    "77": "1. The acute effects of the kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin (498 ki.u./min), and the kininase II inhibitor SQ 14,225 (250 MICROGRAM), GIVEN INTRAVEnously during saralasin-induced angiotensin blockade, were studied in conscious sham-operated rats and rats with benign and malignant two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertension during dietary sodium restriction. 2. The blood pressure of conscious sham-operated rats increased significantly in response to aprotinin. It remained unchanged after SQ 14,225 in contrast to the significant vasodepressor effect seen when SQ 14,225 was given to the same rats under surgical stress and pentobarbital anaesthesia. 3. Benignly hypertensive rats showed a consistent vasopressor response to aprotinin and a marked vasodepressor response to SQ 14,225. The effects of both inhibitors were markedly and significantly blunted in malignantly hypertensive rats. 4. Our demonstration that two agents with known opposite actions on the kallikrein-kinin system produced predictable and opposite effects on blood pressure may indicate that this system is involved in the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure. It may play an important antihypertensive role in benign two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertension, a role which might be impaired in malignant hypertension.", 
    "78": "Captopril, a specific oral inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was given to 18 unselected patients with moderate essential hypertension. Mean blood pressure fell by 14.5% at the maximum dose given, and this fall was significantly correlated with the initial plasma renin activity. The main fall in blood pressure occurred two hours after the first dose of captopril. These results suggest that captopril effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension and that the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system may maintain blood pressure in essential hypertension. This does not necessarily imply that the renin-angiotensin system is the cause of the high blood pressure.", 
    "79": "The effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20881) on the pulmonary circulation were investigated in 13 patients in whom systemic hypertension developed following coronary artery bypass surgery. Pulmonary vascular resistance was decreased by the inhibitor, from 128 +/\u00bf 19 to 92 +/- 20 dynes sec cm-5 (or by 30 +/- 7 per cent; P less than 0.005), and this resulted in a decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure from 17 +/- 1 to 13 +/- 1 mm Hg (or by 23 +/- 3 per cent, P less than 0.005). Consequently, right ventricular work was decreased by the inhibitor by 30 per cent (P less than 0.01), despite an increase in cardiac output (increase in stroke volume) by 16 +/- 6 per cent (P less than 01). This increase occurred despite a 13 +/- 3 per cent decrease in right ventricular filling pressure. The changes in pulmonary vascular resistance correlated with the pretreatment plasma renin activity (r = 0.74, P less than 0.01), as did the decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (R = 0.82, P less than 0.001), but neither change was related to the decrease in left ventricular fillling pressure nor to changes in cardiac output or mean arterial pressure. These results indicate that blockade of the formation of angiotensin II by the converting enzyme inhibitor results in reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure which are unrelated to alterations in left ventricular function. Thus, angiotensin inhibition may have therapeutic value in various clinical states characterized by pulmonary hypertension--especially if renin levels are high.", 
    "80": "Previous studies have suggested that angiotensin II and sodium can act as alternative mechanisms in maintaining high blood pressure in chronic renovascular hypertension, In the present study, exchangeable sodium was measured in rats in which angiotensin II has been confirmed or excluded as the main cause of the hypertension. To determine the degree of participation of angiotensin II in the maintenance of the high blood pressure, we studied the mean blood pressure response to an angiotensin antagonist (1-Sar-8-Ala-angiotensin II) and to a converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ20,881). Rats with a decrease in blood pressure of less than 20 mm Hg, in response to both inhibitors, were classified as nonresponders; those with a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more, as responders. Fifty percent of the rats with two-kidney hypertension were nonresponders, and they had lower blood pressure and plasma renin activity than the responders. Further, these two-kidney, hypertensive, nonresponder rats had normal exchangeable sodium. The two-kidney hypertensive responders, on the other hand, had significantly higher exchangeable sodium than both the two-kidney, hypertensive nonresponders and the two-kidney control rats. These results suggest that angiotensin II and exchangeable sodium do not play a major role in the maintenance of the high blood pressure in the two-kidney hypertensive nonresponders. However, there appears to be an abnormal relationship between renin and exchangeable sodium in the two-kidney hypertensive responders that could contribute to the maintenance of the hypertension.", 
    "81": "Experiments were done in normal rats to assess kidney, single nephron, and tubuloglomerular feedback responses during renin-angiotensin blockade with the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) SQ 20881 (E. R. Squibb & Sons, Princeton, N. Y.) (3 mg/kg, per h). Converting enzyme inhibition was documented by complete blockade of vascular responses to infusions of angiotensin I (600 ng/kg). Control plasma renin activity was 12.5+/-2.7 ng angiotensin I/ml per h (mean+/-SEM) and increased sevenfold with CEI (n = 7). There were parallel increases in glomerular filtration rate from 1.08+/-0.05 to 1.26+/-0.05 ml/min and renal blood flow from 6.7+/-0.4 to 7.5+/-0.5 ml/min. During CEI infusion absolute and fractional sodium excretion were increased 10-fold. Proximal tubule and peritubular capillary pressures were unchanged. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) was measured from both proximal and distal tubule collections; SNGFR based only on distal collections was significantly increased by CEI. A significant difference was observed between SNGFR values measured from proximal and distal tubule sites (6.0+/-1.6 nl/min) and this difference remained unchanged after CEI administration. Slight decreases in fractional absorption were suggested at micropuncture sites beyond the late proximal tubule, whereas early distal tubule flow rate was augmented by CEI. Tubuloglomerular feedback activity was assessed by measuring changes in proximal tubule stop-flow pressure (SFP) or SNGFR in response to alterations in orthograde microperfusion rate from late proximal tubule sites. During control periods, SFP was decreased 11.2+/-0.4 mm Hg when the perfusion rate was increased to 40 nl/min; during infusion of CEI, the same increase in perfusion rate resulted in a SFP decrement of 6.7+/-0.5 mm Hg (P<.001). When late proximal tubule perfusion rate was increased from 0 to 30 nl/min, SNGFR was decreased by 15.0+/-1.2 nl/min during control conditions, and by 11.3+/-1.3 nl/min during CEI infusion. Attenuation of feedback responsiveness during CEI was also observed at lower perfusion rates with both techniques. These results indicate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with CEI reduces the activity of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism which may mediate the observed renal vasodilation.", 
    "82": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalin-degrading enzyme activities were solubilized and purified from a particulate fraction of human diencephalon. Converting enzyme activity and enkephalin-degrading activity elute in different fractions following ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, suggesting that they are different enzymes. Both enzymes were purified further by ion exchange chromatography on hydroxylapatite and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The purified enzymes had markedly different sensitivities to known inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The data do not support the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalin degrading-enzyme are identical.", 
    "83": "The effect on the left ventricle of changes in the state of the arterial vasculature is best identified by utilizing calculations of pulsatile rather than steady flow phenomena. Impedance is the most satisfactory term to describe this effect. The normal ventricle compensates for changes in impedance largely by changes in preload, but the damaged heart loses this compensatory ability and its stroke volume becomes inversely related to outflow resistance. Patients with heart failure behave in a similar fashion and pharmacologic vasodilation may induce marked improvement in left ventricular pump function. Inappropriate vasoconstriction in heart failure may result from stimulation of the sympathetic or renin-angiotensin system. Early experience with converting enzyme inhibitors suggests that blockade of the formation of angiotensin II may be a useful means of treating some patients with heart failure.", 
    "84": "Angiotensin II is dipsogenic, and vasopressin (ADH) regulates renal water excretion. Together, these hormones govern overall mammalian water balance. The Brattleboro rat with inherited diabetes insipidus (DI) lacks ADH and is therefore a convenient model with which to elucidate mechanisms regulating water metabolism. In the present studies, angiotensin II has also been removed from DI rats by the administration of an inhibitor (captopril, SQ 14225; D-2-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl-L-proline) of the enzyme which converts angiotensin I, the relatively inert component of the renin-angiotensin system, to angiotensin II, the biologically active substance. SQ 14225 reduced the drinking rates, and after 6 days lowered peripheral plasma aldosterone concentrations were associated with hyperkalaemia. We conclude that the polydipsia of diabetes insipidus partly results from elevated plasma renin activities and angiotensin II concentrations seen in this syndrome. Further, the apparent hypoaldosteronism of DI Brattleboro rats reflects differences in both tissue usage of the steroid and adrenocortical sensitivities associated with polyuria, hyperosmolarity and possibly potassium wasting.", 
    "85": "Optimal therapy for congestive cardiac failure requires identification of correctable factors that aggravate it as well as an understanding of its etiology. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity, reduced renal blood flow, and cardiac hypertrophy and dilation are the main compensatory processes that occur in response to cardiac failure. Although they may be of initial benefit in supporting a reduced stroke volume, they may ultimately prove self-defeating. New drugs for the treatment of severe congestive heart failure include dopamine, which has a selective nonadrenergic dilator effect on the renal vascular bed, and dobutamine, which has potent inotropic effects, lowers the left ventricular filling pressure and does not increase the heart rate or the systemic vascular resistance. By reducing both the resistance to left ventricular ejection and the venous return to the right heart, vasodilators result in improved peripheral perfusion and reduced pulmonary congestion. Optimal therapy for refractory cardiac failure can be rationally determined by characterizing the hemodynamic profile through measurement of the mean arterial pressure, the left ventricular filling pressure, the cardiac output and the systemic vascular resistance. The specific therapy can then be effectively and safely delivered by a careful analysis of the dose-response relation as identified by hemodynamic monitoring.", 
    "86": "Dogs with thoracic caval constriction retain sodium and develop ascites and edema. The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in this model of low output failure was evaluated before, during, and after administration of the new orally active converting enzyme inhibitor, 2-D-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl-L-proline (SQ 14225). The acute response to the initial oral dose of SQ 14225 (10 mg/kg) consisted of a striking fall in plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) from 22.7 and 29.9 ng% to 10.7, 11.9, and 11.0 ng% (P less than 0.05) after 67.5, 112.5, and 157.5 minutes; sodium excretion increased from 1.9 and 1.9 mu Eq/min to 19.9, 22.4, and 17.8 mu Eq/min. Arterial pressure and filtration fraction decreased (P less than 0.05), and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased (P less than 0.05) after the initial dose of SQ 14225; clearance of paraaminohippuric acid (PAH) and creatinine did not change significantly. The daily responses for 3-4 days to SQ 14225 (35 mg/kg per day, given as doses of 10, 10, and 15 mg/kg) were a decrease in PAC from 50 +/- 15 and 32 +/- 10 ng% to 10 +/- 4 ng% on the 4th day, a value not statistically different from normal (P greater than 0.05), and an increase in sodium excretion from 2.9 to 2.0 mEq/day to 5.7, 10.0, 32.4, and 32.9 mEq/day on a sodium intake of 35 mEq/day (P less than 0.05 for the last 2 days). Arterial pressure and creatinine clearance decreased (P less than 0.05). PRA increased transiently on day 1 of SQ 14225 and then returned toward control levels, and clearance of PAH was unchanged. These data demonstrate an important role for aldosterone and the renin-angiotensin system in the retention of sodium and in ascites formation in dogs with thoracic caval constriction.", 
    "87": "Intravenous infusions of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) at doses of 20, 40 or 80 micrograms/kg min-1 for 30 min produced dose-related decrements in blood pressure in conscious rats fitted with indwelling aortic and vena caval catheters. Immediately upon termination of SNP infusions, blood pressure rebounded to levels which were significantly above pre-SNP control values. The following evidence indicates that the rebound increase in blood pressure was due to increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system: (1) plasma renin activity was increased approximately four-fold by SNP, (2) rebound did not occur in nephrectomized rats, (3) rebound was markedly attenuated in animals treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ14225, (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) and (4) beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol reduced the rebound response. In addition, the magnitude of the rebound following SNP infusions was directly related to the dose of SNP infused. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that renin accumulates during SNP infusion more rapidly than it is metabolized. Consequently, the accumulated renin elicits a hypertensive response when SNP treatment is withdrawn.", 
    "88": "Malignant hypertension with severe hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, depletion of sodium and potassium, and elevated blood levels of renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and arginine vasopressin developed in a woman with renal-artery occlusion. Plasma angiotensin II was disproportionately high in relation to exchangeable sodium. Captopril, by inhibiting conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, further elevated the blood levels of renin and angiotensin I but corrected all other abnormalities. Unilateral nephrectomy was subsequently curative.", 
    "89": "Captopril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was effective in the long-term reduction of blood-pressure in 17 patients with essential hypertension. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide produced a further hypotensive effect, and the combined treatment produced satisfactory control of the blood-pressure for eight months. Captopril prevented and reversed the secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalaemia induced by simultaneous diuretic administration, thus eliminating the need for potassium supplements. The fall in plasma-angiotensin-II and urinary aldosterone and rise in angiotensin I and plasma-renin provide biochemical evidence that captopril inhibits ACE in vivo. No change in circulating venous bradykinin levels could be detected. The hypotensive action of captopril is not mediated by changes in blood-bradykinin but may involve inhibition of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems locally within the kidneys or blood vessels.", 
    "90": "Intravenous administration of SQ-14225, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs resulted in significant decrease in the arterial blood pressure with no changes in the heart rate. Pressure-flow curves obtained in the perfused hind limb vasculature were shifted significantly to the right following SQ-14225 indicating a decrease in the hind limb vascular resistance. Neither the denervation of the hind limb nor bilateral nephrectomy prevented the decrease in the hind limb vascular resistance produced by SQ-14225 indicating that the vasodilator action of this agent was unrelated to either the sympathetic nervous system or the renal renin-angiotensin system. The reflex vasodilatation in the hind limb observed during the administration of pressor agents was significantly attenuated by SQ-14225. Similarly this agent also antagonized the reflex increases in the systemic blood pressure, hind limb perfusion pressure and heart rate observed during bilateral carotid occlusion. These results suggest that the hypotensive action of SQ-14225 in the pentobarbital-anesthetized dog may be unrelated to the renal renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "91": "A randomised open trial was carried out to test the efficacy and safety of Captopril and propranolol in 20 patients with mild and moderate essential hypertension. Mild and moderate was defined as a resting supine diastolic pressure of 100 to 120mmHg at the end of a placebo period. Patients were then randomised into Captopril (12) or propranolol (8) group. After a four-week dose ranging period, they were maintained on the treatment drug, or, if still uncontrolled, the other drug was added. The patients showed good overall blood pressure response to both treatment regimes. Three patients in the Captopril group developed a rash. The significance of the effectiveness in essential hypertension of a drug which acts to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is discussed.", 
    "92": "The effect of captopril (SQ 14,225) a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE: kininase II) on the bronchoconstrictor response to bradykinin was studied in the anesthetized guinea pig. The i.v. administration of captopril caused a profound long lasting hypotension without affecting pulmonary resistance or dynamic compliance. Similarly, the i.v. administration of bradykinin caused small increases in pulmonary resistance and decreases in dynamic compliance which were not altered by the administration of captopril. However, after beta-receptor blockade with propranolol, bradykinin-induced changes in resistance and compliance were enhanced; additional captopril administration further potentiated the bradykinin effects. The prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor indomethacin antagonized the bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in beta-blocked animals and its potentiation by captopril. In the isolated perfused guinea pig lung, bradykinin caused a dose dependent release of a prostaglandin-like substance which was significantly increased by captopril and antagonized by indomethacin. These results suggest that bradykinin causes a prostaglandin-mediated bronchoconstriction. Captopril, a potent inhibitor of ACE, prevents the degradation of bradykinin thus potentiating the bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction, an effect observed in intact animals only in the absence of pulmonary beta-receptor activation.", 
    "93": "Seven patients with essential hypertension and seven patients with hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis received captopril (SQ 14225), an inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme. There was a significant reduction in mean blood pressure, from 176/113 +/- 4/3 mm Hg during the control period to 140/90 +/- 5/3 mm Hg during captopril administration. Five patients received captopril alone and nine patients needed hydrochlorothiazide in addition to control their blood pressure. Captopril produced a significant increase in peripheral plasma renin activity. When measured 12 hours after the administration of captopril the angiotensin I converting enzyme activity was found to be similar to that during the control period even though the blood pressure was at or near normal. These findings indicate that although captopril is an effective antihypertensive agent, its action does not depend only on inhibition of plasma angiotensin I converting enzyme activity.", 
    "94": "1. Angiotensin II (ANG II) was measured in acid-ethanol homogenates of rapidly frozen rat kidneys by a method involving ion-exchange and immunoadsorbent purification of peptides before radioimmunoassay. 2. Concentrations of ANG II found in kidney were 10--20 times that in plasma. 3. Perfusion of the kidneys via the renal artery with isotonic sodium chloride solution or with disodium EDTA solution did not alter the concentrations of intrarenal ANG II. 4. Animals fed on a sodium-deficient diet for 8 days had markedly higher concentrations of intrarenal ANG II, plasma renin activity and kidney renin concentration than sodium-replete animals. 5. After oral sodium loading for 3 weeks, rats had suppressed plasma renin activity and kidney renin concentration but unchanged intrarenal ANG II when compared with animals on a normal sodium intake. 6. One hour after the administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20881) plasma renin activity was elevated, kidney renin concentration unchanged and intrarenal ANG II was depressed. 7. These results demonstrate the presence of ANG II in the extravascular compartment of the kidney. They further suggest that its quantity is influenced by sodium intake and that angiotensin I converting enzyme is essential for its formation.", 
    "95": "Baseline plasma renin activity and responses to saralasin and converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 (teprotide) in 47 untreated patients with surgically correctable renovascular hypertension were compared to those in 100 patients with high- and normal-renin essential hypertension. All 32 renovascular patients on normal sodium intake had high renin-sodium profiles and renin values greater than or equal to 5 ng angiotensin I/mL.h, as compared to 20 of 64 with essential hypertension. Diagnostic discrimination was greatly enhanced by infusion of saralasin or SQ 20881, which elicited marked reactive hyperreninemia in 31 of 32 renovascular patients but in only two of 64 with essential hypertension. Reactive hyperreninemia appeared to be more a specific test for renovascular hypertension than depressor responses. Prior dietary sodium depletion abolished this specificity. The results suggest that after initial screening with renin measurements, testing with angiotensin blocking agents may be a useful secondary screening procedure for more invasive and definitive procedures.", 
    "96": "The effects of [des-Asp1]angiotensin I and angiotensin III on mesenteric blood flow were compared in 15 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. These agonists were administered as bolus injections directly into the vasculature supplied by the superior mesenteric artery. Both [des-Asp1]angiotensin I and angiotensin III produced dose-dependent decreases in mesenteric blood flow, with angiotensin III being more potent than [des-Asp1]angiotensin I at all doses tested. The constrictor responses to [des-Asp1]angiotensin I were markedly attenuated in the presence of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ20881); SQ20881 did not alter responses to angiotensin III or norepinephrine. The administration of [Ile7]angiotensin III (an angiotensin III antagonist) attenuated the responses to both [des-Asp1]angiotensin I and angiotensin III, without altering the responses to norepinephrine. These results suggest that the decrease in mesenteric blood flow produced by [des-Asp1]angiotensin I is largely caused by its local enzymatic conversion to angiotensin III. This conversion in one transit through the mesenteric vasculature is approximately 24%.", 
    "97": "Bradykinin or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), when injected intravenously, decreased blood pressure of conscious rats in a dose-dependent manner, while intracerebroventricular injections of bradykinin or PGE2 caused a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure. SQ 14,225, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, potentiated the central pressor or peripheral depressor effect of bradykinin. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, almost completely inhibited the central pressor effect of bradykinin when injected intraventricularly. Indomenthacin, when injected intravenously, failed to inhibit the peripheral depressor effect of bradykinin, whereas it significantly attenuated the peripheral depressor effect of bradykinin when the angiotensin converting enzyme was inhibited with SQ 14,225. These results suggest that the central pressor effect of bradykinin is mainly mediated by the synthesis of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, while only a small fraction of peripheral depressor effect of bradykinin is, at least in conscious rats, mediated by the synthesis of prostaglandins in the systemic circulation.", 
    "98": "The \"kininase-II\" (EC 3.4.15.1) inhibitor captopril in concentrations up to 10(-4) M did not affect the actions of enkephalins on the isolated electrically stimulated guinea-pig ileum. Captopril (100 mg/kg i.p.) in mice did not influence stimulation-produced analgesia and did not show analgesic properties. It is concluded that \"kininase-II\" is not involved in enkephalin catabolism, since the pharmacological actions of enkephalins were not enhanced after inhibition of the enzyme by captopril.", 
    "99": "Although exogenous angiotensin II (AII) exerts a multitude of effects on the central nervous system, there is little evidence supporting a physiological role for the endogenously produced peptide. Some investigators have tested the hypothesis that AII is physiologically active in the brain with intracerebral infusions of blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. If blocker infusions produce effects that are opposite to exogenous AII infusions, it is evidence supporting a physiological role for endogenously generated angiotensin. Previous work has demonstrated that intraventricular infusion of AII elicits thirst and stimulates antidiuretic hormone and ACTH release. Intracerebral administration of AII also suppresses aldosterone secretion. Experiments that employed the blockers saralasin, a competitive inhibitor of AII, and SQ 20881, a converting enzyme blocker, are presented; results suggest that endogenous AII is involved in the control of thirst and peripheral hormone levels. Infusion of the blockers in the ventricular system led to changes in peripheral hormone concentrations opposite to that observed following infusions of AII.", 
    "100": "The renin-angiotensin system is thought to maintain elevated systemic vascular resistance in heart failure. The hemodynamic effects of captopril (SQ 14225), an oral inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, were measured in 10 patients with stable congestive heart failure poorly controlled by digitalis and diuretics. At single daily doses of 25 to 150 mg, the cardiac index rose from 1.75 +/- 0.18 to 2.27 +/- 0.39 (mean +/- S.D.) liters per minute per square meter (P less than 0.001), and pulmonary-wedge pressure fell from 26.5 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 6.1 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 2006 +/- 300 to 1393 +/- 238 dyne seconds per centimeter (P less than 0.001), and mean arterial pressure fell from 83.7 +/- 7.0 to 70.3 +/- 9.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) (mean +/- S.D.). Heart rate did not change appreciably. Hemodynamic alterations peaked at 90 minutes and persisted for three to four hours. Control plasma renin activity ranged from 1.1 to 7.3 ng per milliliter per hour and did not correlate with changes in hemodynamic values. Three patients on long-term treatment maintained clinical improvement. Although its mechanism of action has not been completely elucidated, captopril may prove useful in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "101": "Angiotensin I convertase activity has been found in human alveolar macrophages from normal volunteers and patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. This activity is higher in the alveolar macrophages from smokers than from nonsmokers, and is even more elevated in sarcoid patients. The activity can be detected with both angiotensin I and bradykinin analogs and appears to require protein synthesis, but the enzyme is not secreted by alveolar macrophages in culture.", 
    "102": "To test the influence of an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, teprotide (SQ 20881), we administered it to seven patients with essential hypertension and normal renal function and nine with an unequivocal reduction in creatinine clearance, caused by bilateral renal-artery stenosis in two and by essential hypertension in seven. Despite the fall in blood pressure (112.7 +/- 4.5 to 100.3 +/- 3.9 mm Hg, mean +/- S.E.M., P less than 0.01), there were prompt increases in both creatinine clearance (95.9 +/- 10.5 to 109.9 +/- 9.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, P less than 0.01) and sodium excretion (17.0 +/- 5.9 to 31.7 +/- 7.2 mumol per minute, P less than 0.01) in patients with essential hypertension. The increase in glomerular filtration rate was most striking, averaging 33 per cent (66.0 +/- 10.3 to 88.0 +/- 9.2 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, P less than 0.001) in patients in whom an initial reduction was evident and hypertension was more severe. These observations suggest that a functional element, perhaps involving angiotensin-mediated renal vasoconstriction, frequently has a role in the reduction in glomerular filtration rate that occurs in essential hypertension. This class of agent may improve renal excretory function as it controls hypertension.", 
    "103": "Norepinephrine (NE) release and pressor response to sympathetic stimulation were studied in dogs under furosemide-induced acute volume depletion. The rise in blood pressure observed following carotid clamping proved similar before and after acute salt and water depletion in the first group of animals and NE rose comparably in these two conditions. Similar results were obtained in a second group of dogs that received an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI). This study shows that contrary to isotonic saline loading, acute salt and water depletion cause a progressive increase in NE plasma levels. Moreover, these results clearly demonstrate that the decrease in sympatho--adrenergic response and the predominant role played by the renin--aniotensin system during chronic salt depletion are not observed in acute conditions.", 
    "104": "The mechanism of diuretic-induced hyperaldosteronism was examined in dexamethasone-pretreated rats. The diuretic drug frusemide brought about a rapid increase in plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration in serum. Half an hour after the administration of frusemide the mean concentration of aldosterone was 25 times higher than in vehicle-treated control animals. Administration of SQ 20,881, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, prevented the adrenal response to frusemide. The response of aldosterone was completely blocked by indomethacin. This drug reduced renin release and probably also inhibited the effect on the adrenal glands of angiotensin, released in response to frusemide. Our results indicate that the effects of diuretics on the adrenal glomerulosa cells are mediated by the renin-angiotensin system also in the rat. Hyperaldosteronism is dependent on the maintenance of prostaglandin synthesis. ACTH has no essential role in this response.", 
    "105": "It has been suggested that intrarenal levels of angiotensin II may preferentially control efferent arteriolar resistance or may influence the glomerular filtration coefficient (Kf). To examine these possibilities, micropuncture and clearance experiments were performed on nine anesthetized dogs evaluating renal and glomerular hemodynamics before and during the administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ20,881). During the micropuncture measurements, renal arterial pressure was reduced to range of 85 to 90 mm Hg in order to maximize renin secretion and intrarenal formation of angiotensin II. Also, this procedure minimizes potential errors in the determination of single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) and of glomerular pressure when estimated by techniques that require complete blockade of proximal tubule fluid flow. During the administration of SQ20,881, a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), renal blood flow increased significantly by 13%, but GFR was not altered. There were no significant alterations in SNGFR, proximal tubule pressure, peritubular capillary pressure or estimated glomerular pressure. By using the micropressure measurements in combination with the whole kidney hemodynamic data, it was estimated that afferent resistance was reduced 23%. Although significant decreases in efferent resistance could not be documented, there was a tendency for this variable to decrease also. Neither Kf nor effective filtration pressure were altered significantly by CEI. These results do not support the contention that intrarenal effects of angiotensin II are exerted predominantly on the efferent arteriolar resistance segments; rather, they suggest that angiotensin may exert a modest tonic effect on both pre- and postglomerular resistance elements in the anesthetized hydropenic dog.", 
    "106": "The spontaneous water intake of rats increases when they are transferred abruptly from a cold (5 degrees C) to a neutral (25 degrees C) environment. This has been termed thermogenic drinking. Treatment of cold-acclimated rats with SQ 14,225, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, at 10-50 mg/kg of body weight prior to removal from cold, inhibited the thermogenic drinking response in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma for determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) was obtained by cardiac puncture from methoxyflurane anesthetized rats maintained chronically at both 25 degrees and 5 degrees C. In addition, plasma was obtained from cold-acclimated rats 15 min after removal from 5 degrees to 25 degrees C. PRA values were 2.2 +/- 0.4 (S.E.) ng/ml/h for control rats; 1.9 +/- 0.8 ng/ml/h for cold-acclimated rats and 8.5 +/- 1.7 ng/ml/h for cold-acclimated rats removed from cold for 15 min. Thus, PRA was significantly increased in rats removed acutely from cold. These data suggest that thermogenic drinking may be mediated by the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "107": "The role of renin-angiotensin system has been examined in the maintenance of hypertension in acute and chronic two-kidney (36 weeks) and chronic one-kidney (12 weeks) Goldblatt hypertensive rats using three inhibitors of this system. The inhibitors used were URI-73A, a synthetic analog of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, which inhibits renin both in vivo and in vitro, SQ14,225, a potent converting enzyme inhibitor, and [Sar1, Thr8] angiotensin II, an angiotensin II antagonist. When the inhibitors were administered in acute (high renin) hypertensive rats, they all lowered blood pressure significantly. However, in the chronic (low renin) hypertensive phase, both renin and converting enzyme inhibitors lowered blood pressure, whereas, Sar1, Thr8 failed to lower blood pressure. The renin inhibitor lowered plasma renin activity (PRA), and SQ14,225 and [Sar1, Thr8] Ang II increased PRA. Further studies on water and electrolyte balance with one-kidney model hypertensive and uninephrectomized control rats showed no change in plasma volume. However, there was increased 24-hour urinary output and increased sodium excretion. This study indicates that in chronic renal hypertensive rats, blood pressure reduction is possible by either renin on converting enzyme inhibitor, but not by angiotensin antagonists. Since volume did not change either during the development or reversal of hypertension, volume did not appear to play a major role in the maintenance of hypertension.", 
    "108": "Sodium depletion was induced in dogs to raise plasma renin activity (PRA) from 1.11 to 26.48 ng/ml/hr. Little overall change in blood pressure (BP) occurred, but cardiac output (CO) and central venous pressure fell, while total peripheral resistance and heart rate (HR) increased. A nonapeptide converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) produced a fall in BP which was linearly related to log. PRA; the intercept with PRA was at 1.05 ng/ml/hr, close to the average value for dogs on a normal diet. The fall in BP with this agent was not accompanied by an increase in HR or CO. When Sar1-Ala8 angiotensin II was used to antagonize the action of angiotensin, the fall in BP was also linearly related to log. PRA. However, for a given level of PRA this fall in BP was less than that achieved with CEI and the intercept of BP fall with PRA was 2.6 ng/ml/hr. Again with this agent there was little change in HR or CO as BP was reduced. Thus, both antagonists lowered peripheral resistance without exciting the homeostatic reflexes indicating that, as PRA rose above the normal resting level, the angiotensin generated had both a direct and indirect effect in maintaining BP.", 
    "109": "Captopril inhibits angiotensin II formation and bradykinin degradation in vivo. Eleven patients with essential hypertension (EH) and four patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) were treated with captopril for periods ranging from 3 days to 12 months. All patients had a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) over 95 mm Hg after receiving a placebo for 3 days. Captopril given in ascending doses (10-1000 mg/day) caused normalization of blood pressure in all but three patients, one with severe RVH whose pressure fell 11%, one patient with severe EH, whose pressure fell 27%, and one with EH whose blood pressure fell 8.5%. The average control DBP in patients with EH was 113.7 +/- 5.5 (SE) mm Hg and fell to 89.9 +/- 3.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), while DBP in patients with RVH fell from 110.7 +/- 7.6 mm Hg to 94.5 +/- 8.2 (p less than 0.005). All patients were studied in balance on a 100 mEq sodium (Na) diet. Plasma renin activity (PRA) versus 24-hour urinary Na excretion increased sevenfold during therapy while converting enzyme activity fell by about one half. The magnitude of the blood pressure response was not related to control PRA. Cardiac output was estimated by echocardiography during placebo administration and during maintenance therapy with captopril. A significant change was not observed. Total peripheral resistance fell an average of 18.9% (p less than 0.05) in 11 of the 13 patients in whom the measurement could be made. It is concluded that captopril effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with EH or RHV by reducing total peripheral resistance.", 
    "110": "Catopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, was given orally during cardiac catheterisation to 6 normotensive patients with refractory congestive heart-failure. 60--180 minutes after administration of 25 mg captopril, arterial pressure fell by 25%, cardiac index rose by 38%, and left-ventricular pressure and right-atrial pressure fell by 25% and 40% respectively. Plasma-renin activity rose while plasma noradrenaline and aldosterone fell. These data suggest that, in the short term, captopril can reduce both preload and afterload, and improve cardiac function, in refractory congestive heart-failure.", 
    "111": "Effects of an orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14225, on the actions of angiotensin I (AI) infused intravenously for 120 to 390 min were studied in 5 normal men. When 20 ng/kg/min of AI infusion was started immediately after a single oral administration of 100 mg of SQ 14225, a significant rise in blood pressure (BP) was observed for the first 15 min, but BP began to fall from 17 min and returned to the pretreatment level at 45 min. This BP level continued at least to 120 min and in one subject to 180 min. In this subject BP began to rise again from 185 min and reached the level of 15 min at 390 min. Plasma AI level increased gradually from 45 min. At 15 min plasma renin activity (PRA) decreased and plasma aldosterone (PA) increased, but then PRA began to increase and PA began to decrease. At 120 min the values of PRA and PA were similar to the pretreatment values. In one subject plasma AI and PRA began to decrease and PA began to increase after 120 or 180 min. On the other hand, in the 5 men sole AI infusion caused a continued BP rise, PRA decrease and PA increase, and sole SQ 14225 administration caused increases in plasma AI and PRA and a decrease in PA but no BP change. From these results it was concluded that complete blockade and partial inhibition of AI conversion by 100 mg of oral SQ 14225 lasted for about 2.5 and 6.5 hr, respectively and that BP rise, PRA suppression and aldosterone stimulation after AI infusion were entirely due to the actions of angiotensin II converted from AI.", 
    "112": "The effect of acute administration of SQ 14,225, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the drinking response of female rats administered either isoprenaline, angiotensin I, or angiotensin II was studied during 2 h after treatment. Administration of isoprenaline (25 micrograms/kg body wt) was accompanied by a significant increase in water intake when compared with saline-treated controls. Acute administration of a constant dose of isoprenaline (25 micrograms/kg body wt) and increasing doses of SQ 14,225 (5--50 mg/kg) was accompanied by a dose-related, linear decrease in water intake. Acute administration of either angiotensin I or angiotensin II (200 micrograms/kg body wt) was accompanied by a significant increase in water intake. The dipsogenic response to angiotensin II was not affected by acute administration of 35 mg SQ 14,225/kg body wt. However, at the same dose of SQ 14,225, angiotensin I-induced thirst was attenuated. Since isoprenaline-induced and angiotensin I-induced, but not angiotensin II-induced, thirsts are blocked by SQ 14,225, the results suggest that isoprenaline-induced thirst is mediated by way of the renin--angiotensin system.", 
    "113": "The relation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to sodium retention was studied in dogs with an aortic-caval fistula and high output failure by administering orally the new converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225. The acute response to an initial oral dose of SQ 14225 (10 mg/kg) consisted in a fall in arterial pressure (BP) from 97 to 67 mmHg, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) from 21.7 to 11.3 ng/100 ml, creatinine clearance (CCr) from 89 to 44 ml/min, and filtration fraction (FF) from 39 to 18%, whereas plasma renin activity (PRA) increases from 12.7 to 36.1 ng angiotensin I.ml-1.h-1 and renal sodium excretion was unchanged. It is suggested that the marked fall in BP and CCr offset the drop in PAC and FF which favored a natriuresis. The daily responses to SQ 14225 for 3 days also showed a fall in BP and PAC but sodium excretion increased. In the animal with the best response, a striking natriuresis occurred. These findings demonstrate an important role for the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in experimental high output failure.", 
    "114": "Purified peptidyl dipeptidase (angiotensin I converting enzyme or kininase II) from human lung or hog kidney is inhibited by commercially prepared plasma protein preparations, by human serum albumin and by the additive albumin stabilizer, acetyltryptophan. After the initial steps of purification, albumin was detected by immunodiffusion as a component in human lung peptidyl dipeptidase preparation. Fragment C of albumin (sequence 124-298) is a more potent inhibitor than the parent molecule (Ki = 1.7 X 10(-5)M). Reduction and carboxymethylation of five of the six S-S bridges in Fragment C yield the most potent noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 3 X 10(-6)M). Reduction of the sixth bridge raises the K1. This indicates that maintenance of the tertiary structure in Fragment C is of importance for the inhibition. Neither albumin nor Fragment C are substrates of the enzyme. Fragment C and its derivative also inhibit the inactivation of bradykinin by the purified human enzyme and by the peptidyl dipeptidase on the surface of intact cultured human endothelial cells.", 
    "115": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on regional blood flow was studied in a total of 21 normotensive Wistar rats fed on either low or high salt diet. A new potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), SQ 14,225 was administered intravenously in a dose of 2 mg/Kg to the conscious animals, and changes in fractional distribution of cardiac output were determined with a microsphere method. Prior to administration of CEI, there was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or regional blood flow between salt-depleted and salt-loaded rats. With CEI, MAP did not change significantly in either group. Fractional distribution of cardiac output increased to the kidneys (p less than 0.002), and decreased to the stomach, spleen, and skeletal muscle (p less than 0.02, p less than 0.002, and p less than 0.01, respectively) in the salt-depleted group, while a pattern of blood flow distribution was not changed in the salt-loaded group. These results suggest that angiotensin II plays an important role in regulating regional blood flow in salt-depleted conscious animals, but not in salt-loaded ones.", 
    "116": "In two patients with end stage renal disease and dialysis-resistant hypertension, the orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, captopril (SQ14,225; 2-D-methyl-3-mercaptopropranoyl-L-proline, dramatically lowered blood pressure both before and during dialysis. This agent holds promise as an alternate to bilateral nephrectomy in such patients.", 
    "117": "Tubuloglomerular feedback has been defined as a mechanism in which changes in distal tubular sodium chloride delivery induce changes in glomerular arteriolar resistance. Experiments were performed in rats to test the hypothesis that the alterations in vasomotor activity are controlled by local hormonal mechanisms. Early proximal flow rate (EPFR), used as an index of filtration rate, was assessed at loop perfusion rates of 10 and 40 nl/min and during zero loop flow before and during intravenous administration of agents which interfere with the reninangiotensin or adrenergic systems. During infusion of the angiotensin (A) antagonists [Sar1,Ile8-]-AII or [Me2,Gly1,Ile8]-AII at doses ranging from 4.8 to 30.6 micrograms/kg . min, feedback response, expressed as percent change of EPFR during loop flow elevation from 3 to 40 nl/min, fell from a mean of 47.6 +/- 3.3% to 33.2 +/- 2.9% (P less than 0.05). Likewise, after administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 in a dose ranging between 5.5 and 34.0 mg/kg, feedback response decreased from 48.5 +/- 2.1% to 25.9 +/- 1.9% (P less than 0.001) and returned to 43.1 +/- 5.1% after the inhibitory effect of SQ 20881 on the pressure response to angiotensin I had disappeared. Luminal application of [Sar1,Thr2]-AII (5mM) or of SQ 20881 (5 or 10 mM) had no effect on the feedback response. A significant reduction in the feedback response was noted also during intravenous infusion of propranolol (46.4 +/- 3.2% vs. 29.0 +/- 2.8%, P less than 0.001), whereas 6-OH-dopamine, reserpine, or phenoxybenzamine had no detectable effect. Our results are in agreement with the concept that the renin-angiotensin system may mediate feedback-induced resistance changes. In addition, circulating catecholamines may, in some unknown manner, act as modulators of the feedback response.", 
    "118": "SQ 14225 infusion to cats exposed to hemorrhage suppressed adrenomedullary catecholamine release. The immediate compensatory blood pressure response was unaffected, while the later compensatory response was of a higher magnitude in intact cats that in SQ 14225-treated animals. Adrenal gland blood flow was better preserved in SQ 14225-treated hemorrhaged cats than in cats exposed to hemorrhage only. These data emphasize the role of angiotensin II in adrenal catecholamine and blood pressure responses to hemorrhage.", 
    "119": "The effects of hydralazine (3 mg/kg) and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (SQ 14,225) (100 mg/kg) on mean arterial blood pressure, plasma renin activity, urinary volume and urinary Na+,K+, and aldosterone concentrations were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the Okamoto and Aoki strain (SHR) after oral daily dosing for 2 weeks, 3 or 6 months. Captopril caused progressive cumulative reductions in blood pressure resulting in normalization of pressure after 6 months of dosing. Hydralazine also significantly reduced blood pressure but not to the level of normotensive rats of the Wistar-Kyoto strain (WKY). Reductions in heart size paralleled the changes in blood pressure, normalization of cardiac hypertrophy occurring after captopril but not hydralazine. Plasma renin activity increased approximately 2-3 fold after hydralazine and 15-fold after captopril. Neither hydralazine nor captopril had any consistent effects on 24-hr urine volume, urinary Na+,K+ or aldosterone excretion. These results indicate that chronic inhibition of ACE with captopril induces normalization of blood pressure in SHR, a normal-renin model of hypertension.", 
    "120": "To determine the relative importance of hormonal factors in mediating the hypotensive response to converting enzyme inhibition (CEI), plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II, and bradykinin responses to SQ20,881 were measured in 20 supine patients with essential hypertension in balance on a 10 mEq sodium diet. Patients were divided into two groups according to their diastolic blood pressure response: responders had a decrement in diastolic pressure which exceeded 9 mm Hg, the upper value of the 95% confidence limits for normotensive patients studied under similar conditions; nonresponders did not. Compared to the nonresponders, responders not only had a higher control PRA (8.7 +/- 1.7 ng/ml/hr vs 4.8 +/- 2.1, p < 0.05) and larger decrement in plasma angiotensin II (18.7 +/- 4.9 pg/ml vs 3.2 +/- 1.7, p < 0.01), but also had a higher control bradykinin (3.2 +/- 0.7 ng/ml vs 1.1 +/- 0.2, p < 0.05) and larger increment in bradykinin (4.5 +/- 1.3 ng/ml vs 1.0 +/- 0.4, p < 0.05) following SQ20,881. Because SQ20,881 altered both angiotensin II and bradykinin concentrations, we assessed the contribution of blockade of angiotensin II formation by administering angiotensin II infusions to seven responders during coverting enzyme blockade, with the angiotensin II dose adjusted to restore diastolic pressure to control levels. The plasma angiotensin II level required to return blood pressure to control was 45 +/- 15 pg/ml higher than the control plasma angiotensin II level (p < 0.01), suggesting that some other factor(s), perhaps bradykinin, are also responsible for the hypotensive response to converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "121": "To determine the mechanism underlying altered adrenal responsiveness in patients with essential hypertension, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis was assessed in normotensive and hypertensive subjects using three pharmacological probes: SQ 20881, a converting enzyme inhibitor; saralasin, a competitive angiotensin antagonist with prominent agonist properties; and angiotensin itself. All subjects were studied while supine and in balance on a 10 meq Na/100 meq K intake. The decrement in plasma aldosterone with SQ 20881 in 26 hypertensive subjects (15+/-3 ng/dl) was normal (13+/-4 ng/dl), suggesting that the altered adrenal responsiveness in hypertensives is not because of a change in a postreceptor event or in the relative contribution of angiotensin to the control of aldosterone secretion. Saralasin at a dose (0.1 mug/kg per min) that reduced aldosterone levels in all normals produced a normal aldosterone decrement (14+/-3 ng/dl) in 19 patients with renovascular hypertension (12+/-4 ng/dl). The same dose, however, had no net effect on plasma aldosterone levels in 70 patients with normal or high renin essential hypertension (-1+/-1 ng/dl) despite identical metabolic balance and control renin and angiotensin levels. The altered response could be explained by an agonist effect, aldosterone rising in 45 of the essential hypertensives. There were no significant differences between normal and abnormal responders in pre- and postcortisol, -potassium, -renin and -angiotensin concentrations. Angiotensin was infused (0.1-3 ng/kg per min) in 15 patients with normal renin essential hypertension, previously studied with saralasin. A probit transformation defined the dose required to induce a 50% increase in aldosterone (ED50). In the patients in whom aldosterone rose with saralasin, the dose required to induce a 50% increase was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than in those in whom aldosterone fell normally (1.02+/-0.06 [SD] vs. 0.38+/-0.07 ng/kg per min). Vascular responses were similar in the various groups. We conclude that altered adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin in some essential hypertensive patients is secondary to a change in the interaction of angiotensin with its adrenal receptor.", 
    "122": "The novel kininase II inhibitor SQ 14225 was intravenously administered to normal conscious dogs at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Urine kinin excretion increased from 14 +/- 6 ng/h to 163 +/- 18 ng/h. Separation by column chromatography showed that the increased urine kinin excretion was due to increased excretion of bradykinin. The enhanced urinary kinin excretion was associated by increased sodium (70%) and decreased kallikrein (27%) excretion. Urine volume and urinary prostaglandin excretion were not significantly affected by SQ 14225 treatment.", 
    "123": "SQ 20881, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was given to 12 patients with renovascular hypertension and to 1 patient with unilateral parenchymatous renal disease in order to evaluate the role of renin-angiotensin systems in their hypertension. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone were assayed in systemic blood before and after the injection of SQ 20881. In 5 patients PRA was also measured separately in each renal vein. Blood pressure decreased, PRA increased, and aldosterone level decreased in the 12 renin-dependent patients. When PRA was sampled separately from each renal vein, the increase was larger on the side of the affected kidney. Four patients with a positive test underwent corrective surgery, and in all blood pressure became normal. SQ 20881 is a useful agent in evaluating the contribution of renin in patients with hypertension.", 
    "124": "Plasma renin activity (rate of angiotensin I generation) does not increase during anesthesia with ketamine, fluroxene, halothane or enflurane in the sodium-repleted rat. However, blood pressure decreases when an angiotensin II antagonist, saralasin, is administered during halothane or enflurane anesthesia, but not during ketamine or fluroxene anesthesia. Differences in the rates of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II induced by various anesthetic agents could help explain these previous findings. To determine the effects of anesthetic agents on angiotensin I conversion, experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo. The activities of rabbit pulmonary converting enzyme in the presence and absence of halothane or fluroxene were measured as rates of appearance of the dipeptide, histidyl-leucine, a product of angiotensin I hydrolysis to angiotensin II. Halothane and fluroxene did not alter conversion. Infusions of angiotensin I and angiotensin II were given to Wistar rats to construct dose-blood pressure response curves. The animals were then anesthetized with ketamine or halothane and infusions were repeated. Angiotensin I and angiotensin II induced similar blood pressure responses in awake and anesthetized rats. However, ketamine accentuated the pressor responses to angiotensin I and angiotensin II, whereas halothane depressed the responses. With the anesthetic agents studied, there is no significant effect on conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II either in vitro or in vivo.", 
    "125": "The i.v. administration of 0.25 mg/kg SQ 20881 to eight renal hypertensive patients caused blood pressure fall and in five of them also reduced heart rate. The latter was attributed to increase in vagal tone. Peripheral and renal blood samples taken at the nadir of the hypotensive response showed considerable inhibition of plasma kininase activity, rise in free kinin level and reduced kininogen content. This reduction was not due to increased consumption as shown by in vitro experiments. PGE2 and PGF2 alpha levels in kidney blood of three patients remained practically unchanged. Plasma renin activity was augmented to a larger extent in blood of kidney with stenotic artery than in the one with patent vessel. It is concluded that the action of SQ 20881 on human blood kinin system, besides inhibition of kininase, involves also reduction of kininogen, the mechanism of which remains to be clarified.", 
    "126": "1 Daily treatment of two-kidney clipped renal hypertensive rats with hydrallazine, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and a new orally active inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, captopril (SQ14,225), was correlated with survival rates for up to 9 months. 2 The groups of rats given captopril alone or captopril plus intermittent or chronic HCTZ had the best survival rate, whereas HCTZ alone or hydrallazine did not benefically affect survival. 3 Survival rates correlated well with control of BP in these animals.", 
    "127": "The diagnostic and therapeutic value of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide (SQ 20881) was assessed in 18 patients with hypertensive emergencies. Mean blood pressure fell 31 +/- 18 mm Hg in the 10 subjects who responded to 1 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously, whereas it fell 5 +/- 3 mm Hg in the eight nonresponders. In patients who had received no previous drug treatment, log baseline plasma renin activity and change in mean blood pressure after SQ 20881 correlated significantly (r = 0.651, P less than 0.05). After acute therapy with SQ 20881, the patients who had a satisfactory response to the drug were treated with propranolol and a relatively normal sodium intake (88 meq/day). Nonresponders were treated with diuretics and sodium restriction (10 meq/day), and intermediate responders were given combination therapy. Mean blood pressure responded favorably within 24 h to the chosen regimen for each group from 152 +/- 47 to 102 +/- 31 mm Hg. SQ 20881 allows prompt evaluation of the role of renin in hypertensive emergencies and permits early choice of appropriate therapy based on the prevailing mechanism.", 
    "128": "Two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt rats were treated with oral converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ14,225) 6 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks after they had developed hypertension. Before treatment, systolic blood pressure rose from 143 to 202 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Tail vein infusions of saralasin 10 microgram/kg/min in conscious rats reduced systolic blood pressure from 202 to 121 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at 8 weeks after clipping the renal artery and before treatment with captopril. Chronic treatment with captopril for 3 additional weeks lowered blood pressure to 173 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). When saralasin infusion was repeated during treatment with captopril, blood pressure fell from 173 to 159 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Blood pressure rose to 197 mm Hg within 4 days after captopril was discontinued and saralasin infusion 3 weeks after captopril (15 weeks after clipping the renal artery) again resulted in a dramatic fall in blood pressure from 197 to 142 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Goldblatt rats who had not received captopril showed no blood pressure response to saralasin infusion at 12 weeks after renal artery clipping. The present study demonstrates that partial inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril results in a delay in the natural evolution of clip hypertension retarding the appearance of hypertension that is resistant to acute saralasin infusion.", 
    "129": "The retained proteins (fraction B: rich in renin) and the not retained proteins (fraction A: no renin activity) were obtained from the concanavalin A affinity column chromatography of the lysosomal contents from the hog renal cortex. Intraperitoneal injection of fraction A, B and highly purified renin produced angionecrosis of fibrinoid type of the small arteries and arterioles in the bilaterally nephrectomized rats. The angionecrosis producing activity (vasotoxicity) as well as vasopressor activity of fraction B were prevented completely by the oral administration of SQ14225. Although fraction A demonstrated no renin activity, intraperitoneal injection of fraction A produced gradual and transient elevation of blood pressure and fibrinoid necrosis which was milder and less consistent as compared with fraction B. The vasotoxicity as well as the transient vasopressor activity of fraction A were completely abolished also by the previous administration of oral SQ14225.", 
    "130": "Plasma renin activity, blood angiotensin I, urinary kallikrein and blood bradykinin levels have been measured concurrently in rats over a range of daily sodium intake. Plasma renin activity, blood angiotensin I levels and urinary kallikrein were significantly increased by the low sodium diet (0.02 mmole per day). Bradykinin levels did not change. Plasma renin and blood angiotensin I were closely linearly related over the range of sodium intakes. Both were associated positively with urinary kallikrein excretion. Converting enzyme inhibition caused prompt, significant changes in plasma renin activity, endogenous circulating angiotensin I, and bradykinin. The changes in circulating hormone levels were dose dependent. Blood angiotensin I levels showed a greater responsiveness than blood bradykinin levels. Plasma renin activity and blood angiotensin I levels are closely related after converting enzyme inhibition. Both increased plasma renin, and impaired clearance of angiotensin I may contribute to blood angiotensin I levels. Difference in responsiveness of blood angiotensin I and blood bradykinin levels after inhibition suggests that other independent controls of the circulating levels of these hormones exist.", 
    "131": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) was subnormal or normal in the main strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). PRA increased greatly in the stroke-prone substrain of SHR (SHRSP) at 20-30 weeks of age. Captopril (SQ 14,225) is an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The drug acutely decreased blood pressure moderately in SHR, and markedly in SHRSP. Participation of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of hypertension in SHR may be limited. Etiology of hypertension in connection with renal excretory function and the central and peripheral nervous system is discussed.", 
    "132": "1. Two hours after oral feeding of normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats with the converting-enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225 (1 and 10 mg/kg), an increase of angiotensin I plasma concentrations from 892 +/- 113 to 1660 +/- 167 and 2951 +/- 405 pg/ml was observed. 2. Administration of SQ 14225 with the drinking fluid overnight suppressed the pressor responses to intravenous angiotensin I, although the blood pressure increase after intravenous angiotensin II was not altered in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. No change of pressor effects after injections of angiotensin I and II into the brain ventricles was observed after oral SQ 14225. 3. Intracerebroventricular infusions of SQ 14225 in spontaneously hypertensive rats abolished the central pressor responses to angiotensin I. 4. The results show that SQ 14225 effectively blocked the conversion of endogenous and exogenous angiotensin I into angiotensin II in plasma, and the conversion of exogenous angiotensin I in brain. Under the conditions studied, SQ 14225 does not cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "133": "Eight patients on chronic haemodialysis for six months to 7 years with hypertension resistant to ultrafiltration and antihypertensive therapy, received Captopril (SQ 14, 225) an orally active inhibitor of converting enzyme. With this therapy, blood pressure was controlled in the 4 patients with the highest plasma renin activity. In the other 4, this treatment had to be supplemented with \"isovolumetric salt subtraction\", i.e. following conventional dialysis, 1-2 litres of ultrafiltrate were replaced by an equal volume of 5% glucose. The slight hyponatraemia induced by this procedure (plasma sodium 128mmol/L) was well tolerated. This procedure allows the removal of an excess of body sodium and seems to be effective even when conventional ultrafiltration during dialysis has failed. Administration of Captopril either alone or combined with \"isovolumetric salt subtraction\" induced good control of blood pressure in all 8 patients.", 
    "134": "Seventeen hypertensive patients were treated with captopril, an orally active inhibitor of converting-enzyme. All patients showed a fall in blood pressure (BP), although in some patients only after the addition of diuretics. In 2 patients a skin rash developed. One patient developed proteinuria. A renal biopsy revealed membranous glomerulopathy. Correlations were found between pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and the decrease in BP, and between pretreatment PRA and the decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). Filtration fraction (FF) fell, indicating a decrease in renal vascular resistance. Captopril decreased the sensitivity to exogenous angiotensin I (AI), dependent on the captopril dose used. The sensitivity to exogenous bradykinin increased impressively even on the lowest dose of the drug. These observations suggest extrapulmonary conversion of AI to angiotensin II (AII).", 
    "135": "The short-term cardiovascular and endocrine effects of an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ14,225, were evaluated in 17 subjects with drug-resistant hypertension (10 with essential and seven with renovascular hypertension). On normal dietary sodium, SQ14,225 (after 3 days at average dose of 664 mg/day) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly (from 141 +/- 4 to 122 +/- 4 mm Hg, (SE), p less than 0.001). However, only eight of the patients achieved blood pressures within the normotensive range. Of eight patients with residual hypertension, seven exhibited further decreases in MAP (from 132 +/- 4 to 108 +/- 6 mm Hg (SE), p less than 0.001) when dietary sodium was reduced to 10 mEq/day. No rebound hypertension was noted when treatment was temporarily discontinued for 3 days in 11 patients. The reductions in blood pressure were not associated with either orthostatic hypotension or interference with baroreceptor reflexes. The values of supine plasma renin activity (PRA) were not always predictive of blood pressure responsiveness to the drug. With treatment, plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC) decreased modestly (values from 40 +/- 9 to 22 +/- 3 ng/dl (SE), p less than 0.05). The plasma concentrations of cortisol, norepinephrine and serum potassium were left unchanged during the period of studies. The present study has not defined the exact mechanism by which SQ14,225 lowered blood pressure. Nevertheless, it indicates that this agent may be a practical therapeutic adjunct in the treatment of certain subsets of the human hypertensive population. The lack of serious interference with cardioscular and humoral homeostasis adds to its attractiveness as a therapeutic agent.", 
    "136": "The mechanism by which the angiotensin I (AI) converting enzyme inhibitor SQ20,881 (less than Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Glu-Ile-Pro-Pro) blocks the pressor response to exogenous AI was studied in vivo in the intact anesthetized dog. When administered as a single dose 250 times that of injected AI (250 nmoles/kg) into either the pulmonary or systemic circulation, SQ20,881 produced inhibition of pulmonary conversion of exogenous AI to AII that lasted for more than 6 hours as judged by the absence of immunoreactive or labeled AII in the pulmonary venous effluent. In contrast, the pressor response to exogenous AI began to reappear within 1 hour of SQ20,881 administration. Six hours following SQ20,881, the pressor response to AI had nearly returned to normal, still in the absence of demonstrable intrapulmonary conversion and without release of detectable amounts of AII into the pulmonary venous effluent. These experiments demonstrated that AI has a pressor effect in the presence of SQ20,881 that is independent of pulmonary conversion. Studies with (Des-Asp) AII and (Des-Asp, Arg) AII showed that the delayed pressor response to AI following SQ20,881 administration could not be accounted for by circulating peptide metabolites of AI or AII. A competitive inhibitor of AII, (D-Asp, Ile) AII completely blocked the returning pressor response, suggesting that extrapulmonary generation of AII was responsible. The data strongly suggest that the systemic vascular bed taken as a whole contains large amounts of AI converting enzyme that is capable of rapid generation of AII without releasing the peptide into circulation. The extrapulmonary enzyme is more resistant to long-lasting blockade by SQ20,881 than pulmonary converting enzyme. The physiological role of extrapulmonary conversion systemic and local circulatory homeotasis remains to be assessed.", 
    "137": "Several peptides were investigated for their inhibitory capacity against dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (angiotensin-converting enzyme) from human seminal fluid. The strongest inhibitor was the nonapeptide SQ 20881. A marked inhibition was also shown by the compounds Phe-Ala-Pro and Boc-Phe-Ala-Pro, which behaved as competitive inhibitors. Among the peptides related to angiotensin, angiotensin III was the strongest inhibitor, followed by angiotensin II and the C-terminal hexapeptide of angiotensin II. The results indicate the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase of human semen is very similar to pulmonary dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase in its susceptibility to peptide inhibitors. In view of these and other previously reported similarities, it is possible that both enzymes are identical.", 
    "138": "Urines and sera (human, guinea pig and rat) contain low molecular weight inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The urines contain ACE, but the enzyme is scarcely measurable without prior ultrafiltration or dialysis. The activity increases strikingly through three ultrafiltration steps using a membrane with a 10,000 MW retention limit. As implied, the ultrafiltrates contain inhibitory activity and can prevent the hydrolysis of [3H]benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu by ACE from any source, including lung and serum. Human urinary ultrafiltrate contains at least three inhibitors separable on Bio-Gel P-2. The inhibitors are acidic and can be partially purified on Bio-Rex 70 developed with an acetic acid gradient. The smallest of the inhibitors can be purified to apparent homogeneity by partition chromatography (sephadex G-25; butanol, acetic acid, H2O; 4:1:5). The excretion of inhibitory activity varies in response to dietary salt: Activity is low when rats are maintained on a high NaCl diet and is high (3 x's control) on a low NaCl diet. Thus, the activity of ACE may be modulated in vivo by naturally-occurring enzyme inhibitors. Whether some hypertensive patients are deficient in ACE inhibitory activity remains to be determined.", 
    "139": "1 Prolonged infusion (11 h) of both saralasin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ20881) gradually lowered BP in two-kidney hypertensive rats to levels similar to that in normotensive rats infused with dextrose. 2 Saralasin did not lower BP in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. 3 These observations support the notion that in chronic renal hypertension, angiotensin II may maintain hypertension by a slowly developing action. 4 Plasma angiotensin II in rats infused with SQ20881 was suppressed relative to renin, but was not eliminated. 5 Chromatography of angiotensin II extracts from dogs infused with converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ14,225) showed that the very high levels of angiotensin I achieved after treatment with SQ14,225 can lead to falsely high estimated angiotensin II levels as a result of angiotensin I cross-reacting with the angiotensin II assay.", 
    "140": "1 Captopril (SQ14,225), an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was administered to nine patients with essential hypertension. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was low in four, 'normal' in three and high in two patients. 2 In the hospital, captopril alone induced a significant drop in BP from 165 +/- 6/106 +/- 2 to 140 +/- 5/90 +/- 1 mmHb (P less than 0.001). PRA increased concomitantly (P less than 0.05), whereas plasma-converting enzyme activity (P less than 0.005) and plasma aldosterone (P less than 0.05) were reduced. 3 Six patients underwent chronic ambulatory therapy with captopril for a mean of 16 +/- 3 weeks. After discharge from the hospital, BP remained normalized but in five out of six patients this required additional diuretic therapy. 4 The results suggest that captopril alone or combined with diuretic therapy provides a new, efficient and well tolerated tool to treat patients with essential hypertension independently of their PRA level. It may turn out to be more effective in lowering BP than beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents.", 
    "141": "The antihypertensive effect of the orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14225) was assessed in 22 hypertensive patients of whom 17 were followed for periods ranging from 1 to 7 months. Of these, eight had essential hypertension, eight had renovascular hypertension, and six had hypertension associated with chronic renal failure. Blood pressure decreased markedly in all patients, including those with low renin levels. Nevertheless, the magnitude of blood pressure reduction correlated with the base-line plasma renin activity (r = 0.58, P less than 0.01). Increasing the dose of captopril from 25 to 200 mg did not enhance the amplitude of the antihypertensive effect but did increase its duration. Patients' blood pressure remained well controlled and free of side-effects with a maximal daily dose of up to 200 mg by mouth twice daily. Despite the blood pressure reduction, sodium excretion tended to increase, probably because of reduced aldosterone secretion. There was no evidence of orthostatic hypotension, and no escape from the antihypertensive effect was observed. These results indicate that chronic inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme with an orally active compound offers a new, efficient, and well-tolerated approach to the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "142": "Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) activity was significantly higher in 90 patients with sarcoidosis (55 +/- [S.D.] 23 nmol min-1 ml-1) than in 80 healthy controls (34 +/- 9 nmol min-1 ml-1). Steroid therapy modified SACE activity; 60 sarcoidosis patients who were not being treated with steroids had significantly higher enzyme activities (58 +/- 24 nmol min-1 ml-1) than 30 steroid-treated sarcoidosis patients (40 +/- 19 nmol min-1 ml-1). In 50% of the non-steroid treated sarcoidosis patients SACE activity was more than 2 S.D. above the mean value for the controls. SACE activity was measured in 22 tuberculous patients (38 +/- 14 nmol min-1 ml-1), 20 leprosy patients (34 +/- 9 nmol min-1 ml-1), 31 with primary biliary cirrhosis (44 +/- 20 nmol min-1 ml-1), 26 with inflammatory bowel disease (31 +/- 9 nmol min-1 ml-1), 8 with hepatic granulomatous disease, 5 with Hodgkin's disease, and 2 with schistosomiasis. The combined false-positive rate for these non-sarcoidosis patients was 10%. Serial SACE assays provide useful information on the course of sarcoidosis and response to steroid treatment.", 
    "143": "Captopril, or SQ 14,225 an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, produced a significant blood pressure reduction in 26 hypertensives. This new drug, alone or combined with a diuretic, has normalized the blood pressure of the 22 patients on long-term treatment.", 
    "144": "Rat kidneys were perfused with an artificial solution at constant pressure. The infusion of angiotensin II (AII) (1.5--6 ng min-1) reduced renal perfusate flow (RPF) from 36.6 +/- 2.4 to 19.3 +/- 1.4 ml min-1 (P less than 0.001) (n = 13); GFR rose from 0.48 +/- 0.06 to 0.63 +/- 0.04 ml min-1 (P less than 0.05), and filtration fraction (FF) rose accordingly from 0.015 +/- 0.002 to 0.033 +/- 0.003 (P greater than 0.01). The same results were obtained with purified renin substrate (synthetic tetradecapeptide, 100 ng min-1, n = 8); RPF fell from 31.5 +/- 2.9 to 17.2 +/- 2 ml min-1 (P less than 0.001), GFR rose from 0.36 +/- 0.05 to 0.51 +/- 0.04 ml min-1 (P less than 0.05), and FF increased from 0.021 +/- 0.002 to 0.034 +/- 0.006 (P less than 0.01). The effects of renin substrate were completely prevented by the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20,881 (3 X 10(-5) M). In another six experiments the effects of renin substrate at the same dose were fully reversed by addition of the analogue [Sar1,Ala8]AII. We interpret these findings to indicate that both exogenous and endogenous AII produce preferential vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, increasing the driving force for ultrafiltration and thereby maintaining or increasing GFR in the face of a reduced plasma flow.", 
    "145": "Two independent mutants of Escherichia coli deficient in dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity (Dep-) were isolated after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate. Mating experiments and introduction of specific episomes indicated that the responsible gene was located at approximately 27--31 min on the E. coli chromosome. The Dep- mutants differed from the parental strain in their inability to grow with N-acetylalanylalanylalanine as the sole nitrogen source. Revertants selected for growth on this substrate of the enzyme were found to have reacquired the activity. Enzyme activity was highly sensitive to inhibition by 1-(D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-proline (SQ 14225), a potent inhibitor of mammalian dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (angiotensin-converting enzyme, peptidyl dipeptidase, EC 3.4.15.1). This compound also reduced the rate of growth of the wild type with N-acetylalanylalanylalanine but not with ammonium sulfate. A fraction of the enzyme was released into the medium by osmotic shock, indicating that its presence in the periplasmic space may account for growth with N-acetylated peptides that cannot be taken up by E. coli. In addition to providing information about the specific role of this exopeptidase in E. coli, the Dep- mutants may prove useful for delineating the regulation and cellular function of dipeptidyl carboxypeptidases in higher organisms.", 
    "146": "1. Captopril or SQ 14 225, administered orally twice a day, reduced the blood pressure of hypertensive patients whatever their clinical diagnosis and even when their plasma renin activity was 'normal' or low. 2. Long-term administration of captopril, either alone or together with diuretics, provides a powerful new tool with which to treat ambulatory hypertensive patients. 3. The renin system may play an important role in maintaining blood pressure in a majority of hypertensive patients.", 
    "147": "The mechanism of the dipsogenic action of synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate (TDP) was studied in rats with chronically implanted lateral ventricular cannulae. All hormones and drugs were injected via the ventricular cannulae. The dipsogenic action of TDP was unaffected by the renin inhibitor pepstatin but was markedly reduced by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881. Homogenates of rat brain readily formed angiotensin II from TDP in vitro and this was likewise unaffected by pepstatin but was reduced or abolished by SQ 20881 or by chelating agents. Natural renin substrate did not cause drinking and did not generate angiotensin II when incubated with brain homogenates. These results demonstrate that rat brain converting enzyme can generate angiotensin II from TDP and that this effect is responsible for the dipsogenic action of TDP.", 
    "148": "Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe, the N-terminal pentapeptide of bradykinin, is not an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme and is not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Arg-Pro-Pro, the N-terminal tripeptide is a relatively potent (IC50 = 2.3 X 10(6) M) inhibitor but its higher homolog. Gly-Arg-Met-Lys-Arg-Pro-Pro is not an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "149": "The hypothesis that increased plasma-renin tends to lower blood-pressure is proposed. Binding of renin to blood-vessel walls is postulated to have some vasodilator action which would oppose the usual blood-pressure-raising action caused by generation of angiotensin. Many of the effects of saralasin and of converting-enzyme inhibitor on blood-pressure in relation to concentrations of renin in blood plasma and in the kidneys seem to support this hypothesis.", 
    "150": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating the circulatory and metabolic responses to hypoxia was studied in three groups of conscious dogs that were infused continuously with normal saline, teprotide (10 mug/kg per min), and saralasin (1 mug/kg per min), respectively. Hypoxia was produced by switching from breathing room air to 5 or 8% oxygen-nitrogen mixture. Plasma renin activity increased from 2.3+/-0.4 to 4.9+/-0.8 ng/ml per h during 8% oxygen breathing, and from 2.8+/-0.4 to 8.4+/-1.8 ng/ml per h during 5% oxygen breathing. As expected, cardiac output, heart rate, mean aortic blood pressure, and left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P increased during both 5 and 8% oxygen breathing in the saline-treated dogs; greater increases occurred during the more severe hypoxia. Teprotide and saralasin infusion diminished the hemodynamic responses to 5% oxygen breathing, but did not affect the responses to 8% oxygen breathing significantly. In addition, the increased blood flows to the myocardium, kidneys, adrenals, brain, intercostal muscle, and diaphragm that usually occur during 5% oxygen breathing were reduced by both agents. These agents also reduced the increases in plasma norepinephrine concentration during 5% oxygen breathing, but had no effects on tissue aerobic or anaerobic metabolism. In dogs pretreated with propranolol and phentolamine, administration of teprotide (0.5 mg/kg) during 5% oxygen breathing reduced mean aortic blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance, and increased cardiac output and heart rate, but did not affect left ventricular dP/dt, dP/dt/P, and end-diastolic pressure. Simultaneously, renal and myocardial blood flows increased and myocardial oxygen extraction decreased, while myocardial oxygen consumption did not change significantly. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the hemodynamic responses to severe hypoxia. It appears that angiotensin not only exerts a direct vasoconstrictor action, especially upon the coronary and renal circulations, but also potentiates the cardiovascular effects of sympathetic stimulation that occur during severe hypoxia.", 
    "151": "The etiology of afterload elevation in congestive cardiac failure is unclear, but experimental evidence suggests a role for the renin-angiotensin system in maintaining elevated peripheral vascular resistance. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor SQ20,881 was administered to eight patients with congestive cardiac failure (four hypertensives, four normotensives) during or one day after diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Various hemodynamic measurements performed before and during blockade indicate that this agent caused improvement in cardiac function in all patients by decreasing afterload. This improvement correlated with the decrease in total vascular resistance but was independent of the baseline blood pressure and plasma renin activity. These results suggest that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme is a worthwhile approach to the treatment of congestive heart failure, although its exact mechanism of action remains unclear.", 
    "152": "In 15 patients with severe chronic left ventricular failure, plasma renin activity (PRA) ranged widely, from 0.2--39 ng/ml/hr. The level of PRA was unrelated to cardiac output (CO) or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PWP), but was slightly negatively correlated with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r = -0.45) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (r = -0.40). After infusion of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide (SQ 20,881) PWP fell from 26.3 +/- 1.3 (SEM) to 20.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), CO rose from 3.94 +/- 0.23 to 4.75 +/- 0.31 l/min (P less than 0.001), MAP fell from 87.5 +/- 3.8 to 77.9 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and SVR from 1619 +/- 148 to 1252 +/- 137 dyne-sec-cm-5 (P less than 0.001). The fall in MAP and in SVR was significantly correlated with control PRA (r = 0.68 and r = 0.58, respectively). When subjects were divided on the basis of control PRA the hemodynamic response to teprotide was greatest in the high renin group. PRA rose after teprotide (8.7 +/- 3.4 to 37.9 +/- 7.7 ng/ml/hr, P less than 0.05) but plasma norepinephrine fell (619.1 +/- 103.6 to 449.7 +/- 75.7, P less than 0.05). The renin-angiotensin system thus appears to have an important role in the elevated SVR in some patients with heart failure. Chronic inhibition of converting enzyme should be explored as a possible therapeutic approach.", 
    "153": "Effects of SQ-14225 (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) on the pressor responses to angiotensin I (A-I) and on the arterial blood pressure were investigated in anesthetized mongrel dogs. All the three doses significantly inhibited A-I induced pressor response (70-80%), however reduction in the blood pressure was noted only with the highest dose used. Neither bilateral nephrectomy, autonomic ganglionic blockade nor pretreatment with saralasin, an angiotensin II antagonist, altered the hypotensive activity of SQ-14225 (3 mg/kg, i.v.). The results of this study indicate that significant inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme does not result in a decrease in the blood pressure in dogs, and that the hypotension produced by SQ-14225 may involve a mechanism yet to be identified.", 
    "154": "1. The haemodynamic effects of oral converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14225) were assessed in eight patients with severe essential or renovascular hypertension. 2. Mean arterial pressure fell (149 +/- 5 to 127 +/- 8 mmHg, P less than 0.02), because of a fall in total peripheral resistance (6.9 +/- 0.53 to 5.7 +/- 0.40 kPa 1(-1)s m2) without a significant change in cardiac index. Two of the eight patients were non-responders without pressure reduction or a haemodynamic change. Sodium restriction (10 mmol/day) while the same dose of SQ 14225 was continued further lowered arterial pressure (137 +/- 8 to 111 +/- 12 mmHg, P less than 0.05) through further resistance reduction (6.5 +/- 0.53 to 5.2 +/- 0.40 kPa 1(-1)s m2, P less than 0.05). 3. Haemodynamic responses to head-up tilt (increased heart rate and resistance, decreased cardiac index) were unaffected by SQ 14225 regardless of sodium intake. 4. The pattern of reduction in peripheral resistance, with unchanged cardiac index, was similar to that produced by vasodilators acting at both arteriolar and venular levels.", 
    "155": "Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and plasma renin activity (PRA) were studied during the development of the widespread necrotic arterial disease that occurs in the induction phase of one-kidney perinephritis hypertension. Control serum ACE activity was significantly higher in rabbits developing many arterial lesions than it was in rabbits developing relatively few arterial lesions. Serum ACE decreased 7 days after the production of unilateral perinephritis in all rabbits. Following contralateral nephrectomy, serum ACE decreased further in rabbits devloping many arterial lesions but returned toward control values in rabbits developing relatively few arterial lesions. Significant inverse correlations were demonstrated for the total number of arterial lesions that developed relative to a) the decrease in serum ACE activity 7 days after the production of unilateral perinephritis, b) the lowest or the average serum ACE activity during the period of development of the arterial lesions after contralateral nephrectomy, and c) the change in serum ACE activity during the period of development of the arterial lesions. Chronic treatment with SQ 20,881, a synthetic nonapeptide inhibitor of ACE activity, during the period of development of the hypertension and the arterial lesions significantly reduced the serum ACE activity and the hypertension but did not change interrelationships between serum ACE activity and the number of arterial lesions that developed. PRA significantly decreased after the production of perinephritis and decreased somewhat further during the induction period of the hypertension after contralateral nephrectomy. No relationships were demonstrated between PRA, or changes in PRA, and the development of arterial lesions. The increase in blood pressure during the incubation period of the hypertension did not correlate with the number of arterial lesions that developed. These finding indicate that serum ACE activity reflects importantly on the capacity to develop necrotic arterial lesions during the induction phase of one-kidney perinephritis hypertention and on functional events relating to their pathogenesis.", 
    "156": "It was demonstrated that angiotensin I-converting enzyme was excreted in human urine. The mean activity of the enzyme in normal urine was found to be 0.38 +/- 0.04 (S.E.M.) units/day (n = 18) and the enzymic activity correlated well with the concentration of the excreted sodium (r = 0.76, p less than 0.005). Urinary angiotensin I-converting enzyme was partially purified. Three different molecular weights of enzyme (greater than 400 000, 290 000 and 140 000) were demonstrated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. The enzymic properties of these three enzymes were identical with those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme from human lung with regard to inhibitory effects (bradykinin potentiator c and Arg-Pro-Pro), Cl- dependency, pH optimum and KM value.", 
    "157": "Indirect systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored in 9 groups of 15 male conscious 2-kidney renal hypertensive rats (RHR) for over 6 months. Daily oral dosing with captopril (SQ 14,225, D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline, 30 mg/kg), an orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, lowered SBP 30--50 MM Hg during this period. Withdrawal of captopril for 5 days at 1, 3 and 6 months resulted in gradual return of SBP to control levels without overshoot. Resumption of dosage with captopril again decreased SBP. Daily oral dosing with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 6 mg/kg/day) alone for 6 months had little or no effect on SBP, but increased the antihypertensive effect of captopril. Daily oral dosing with hydralazine (6 mg/kg) caused an initial marked antihypertensive effect greater than that of captopril but almost complete tolerance developed within 4 weeks of dosing. Highest survival rates occurred in RHR treated with captopril plus HCTZ. In four other similarly treated groups of RHR and normotensive rats (NR), least cardiac hypertrophy and highest plasma renin activity occurred in captopril-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated controls. Plasma renin activity was about 2 to 4 fold higher in the rats dosed with captopril compared with vehicle-treated rats. Heart weight/body weight ratios, initially higher in the two RHR groups compared to NR, decreased only in the captopril treated group to or near those of the NR groups. These results indicate that chronic treatment with captopril decreased SBP and cardiac weights of RHR, and that HCTZ, or possibly other diuretics, can augment the antihypertensive effect of captopril while having little or no effect by themselves.", 
    "158": "Oral administration of SQ 14,225 (0.03--3 mg/kg) to conscious normotensive dogs caused inhibition of the pressor response to intravenously administered angiotensin I (AI), the duration of which was dose-dependent. All doses of 0.1 mg/kg or greater caused 85--95% inhibition 30 min after administration whereas 0.03 mg/kg produced only a 25% inhibition. Pressor responses to angiotensin II (AII) were not similarly inhibited. Blood pressure was moderately reduced in a dose-related manner and followed the same pattern as inhibition of the AI pressor responses. The maximum change occurred after 1.0 mg/kg with only a more rapid onset occurring after the 3.0 mg/kg dose. Heart rate was not appreciably changed. SQ 14,225 also increased plasma renin activity (PRA), the levels and duration of which were dose-related. These data indicate that SQ 14,225 is an orally effective, potent inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) in dogs. It appears that in mongrel dogs, ACE inhibition results in a slight to moderate reduction in blood pressure and an increase in PRA.", 
    "159": "The activity of peptidyl dipeptidase (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1), also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme, was studied in small blood vessel preparations isolated from rabbit brain. The vascular preparation contained arterioles and capillaries and was essentially free of extravascular material. Enzymatic activity was demonstrated in microvessel homogenates using both hippuryl-histidyl-leucine and tritium-labeled angiotensin I as substrates. Activity in the microvessels was dependent on the presence of chloride ion and was sensitive to inhibition by converting enzyme inhibitors previously shown to be effective in both vivo and in vitro. Specific activity in the micro-vessels was approximately 20 times that in homogenates of brain, and was almost 60% of that found in rat lung homogenates. The data were consistent with an endothelial localication for peptidyl dipeptidase in the cerebral vasculature and supports the proposal that this enzyme has a physiological role in extrapulmonary vascular beds.", 
    "160": "We assessed the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of aldosterone secretion in response to sodium restriction in 62 normal subjects. Both saralasin, an angiotensin II antagonist, and SQ 20881, a converting enzyme inhibitor, induced a dose-related decrease in plasma aldosterone levels when the renin-angiotensin system was activated by restriction of sodium intake. Two types of experiments were performed with saralasin. In the first set, a dose-response relationship was established 20 min after beginning infusions ranging from 0.03-1.0 microgram/kg/min. The optimal dose was 0.1 microgram/kg/min, with a reduction in aldosterone levels of -10.1 +/- 3.8 ng/dl (P less than 0.025). Higher doses induced smaller reductions in aldosterone levels. In the second set, a 3-h infusion was given. The results were qualitatively similar but the magnitude was greater (-15 +/- 4 ng/dl; P less than 0.01). The aldosterone response 20 min after administration of SQ 20881 paralleled the angiotensin II response, with the first significant decrement (-6.5 +/- 1.5 ng/dl; P less than 0.01) occurring at 0.1 mg/kg and maximum (-10 +/- 3 ng/dl) occurring at 0.3 mg/kg. Thus, both agents produced qualitatively similar changes in aldosterone secretion in sodium-restricted normal subjects. However, neither reduced sodium restricted aldosterone levels to that measured in sodium-loaded subjects because of the intrinsic limitation of each agent. Saralasin is a partial agonist. SQ 20881 induces an increase in plasma renin activity via interruption of the short feedback loop, which probably limits its action. Yet, these data do support the hypothesis that angiotensin mediates the adrenal's response to sodium restriction in normal man.", 
    "161": "The pharmacodynamics and efficacy of the new Soviet drug parmidin depending on the state of the coronary reserve are discussed on the basis of the results of observation over 176 patients suffering from chronic ischemic heart disease with affection of the peripheral arteries of the lower extremities. The activity of the drug in patients with atherosclerotic and diabetic affection of the arterial vessels is shown. The pharmacokinetics of parmidin in patients after the administration of a single 1.0 g dose was studied by determining its content in blood and urine 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours later. The effect of parmidin on the blood kinin system in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease was studied.", 
    "162": "The direct oxidation of a dipeptide azlactone (1) by DDG affords an optically active unsaturated dipeptide azlactone (2). It was shown that the double bond had the Z-configuration and that no racemization of the proline moiety occurred during the oxidation. The dehydrotripeptide, Z-Pro-delta-Phe-Phe OH (9b) was prepared by direct coupling of azlactone (2) with phenylalanine tetramethyl-guanidinium salt and was shown to be stable to chymotrypsin. The tetrapeptide, Z-Pro-delta-Phe-His-Leu OH (11), was prepared directly from the azlactone (2) and by saponification of the tetrapeptide ester (10) prepared by mixed anhydride coupling of Z-Pro-deltaPhe OH (7) with the dipeptide ester. The dehydropeptide (11) inhibits angiotensin I converting enzyme (IC50, 1X10-4 M).", 
    "163": "Captopril (SQ 14 225), an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was given to 7 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure whose plasma-creatinine ranged from 1.5--7.4 mg/dl; whose plasma-renin activity was normal; whose hypertension was not controlled by previous therapy consisting in 5 patients of three or more antihypertensive drugs; and whose blood-pressures averaged 176/111 +/- 11/3 mm Hg. Inhibition of converting enzyme by oral captopril, 200 mg twice daily, reduced blood-pressure to 156/100 +/- 9/5 mm Hg. 5 patients needed additional treatment by frusemide 40--250 mg/day orally. With this combined regimen the blood-pressure of all patients averaged 126/85 +/- 4/3 mm Hg after 8 +/- 2 weeks of captopril. The drug was well tolerated. These results suggest that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with or without sodium depletion is an efficient treatment for hypertension associated with chronic renal failure. It appears that although renin levels in patients with this condition may be \"normal\", they are inappropriate in relation to the subtle degree of sodium retention that occurs with this disorder.", 
    "164": "The two naturally occurring analogues of angiotensin II (AII), Asp1-Val5-AII and Asp1-Ile5-AII, were equally effective as intracranial dipsogens in the water-replete rat. Renin, synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate (SRS) and angiotensin I (AI) also produced copious drinking when injected into the brain, but the naturally occurring renin substrate of rat caused little drinking and was much less effective than SRS. Prior intracranial injection of pepstatin, a competitive antagonist of the renin-angiotensinogen reaction, reduced drinking in response to renin and SRS but not to AI and AII. Renin-, SRS- and AI-induced drinking were inhibited by the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 injected through the same intracranial cannula in antagonist to agonist ratio of 1000:1, whereas the AII response was enhanced, although not significantly so, and the carbachol response was unaffected. Finally, position 8 aliphatic substituted analogues of AII were competitive antagonists of AII-induced drinking, and also inhibited drinking induced by renin, SRS and AI injected through the same intracranial cannula, but they did not inhibit carbachol-induced drinking. In conclusion, the angiotensin-sensitive receptor for thirst does not accept SRS or AI. It responds best to AII.", 
    "165": "Carrageenin-induced oedema in rats was potentiated by oral administration of (4R)-3-[(2S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl]-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid (SA291) and related sulfhydryl compounds, and the effect was closely correlated with their potencies as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme in vivo.", 
    "166": "1. The renal artery of conscious dogs was acutely narrowed over 30 s to reduce renal artery pressure distal to the stenosis to 40 mmHg and the stenosis was maintained for 1 h. The distal renal artery pressure was rapidly restored to a plateau slightly below pre-stenosis values within 10--15 min. Rises in systemic blood pressure and plasma renin activity were small and transient. 2. This restoration was an active process, mediated by the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II (AII), since it was greatly diminished or abolished when the renal artery was narrowed in the presence of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist (1-Sar-8-Ile AII). However, it was not diminished by 'total' autonomic effector blockade. 3. This angiotensin II-mediated restoration of renal artery pressure may be of homeostatic significance for the maintenance of glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "167": "Adrenal epinephrine (E) release after hemorrhage in anesthetized dogs is blunted by acute nephrectomy and restored by angiotensin II infusion. In the present study, we report the effect of converting enzyme inhibition by SQ 20881, a decapeptide, and of competition inhibition of angiotensin II by saralasin (1-Sar-8-Ala-Ang-II) on reflexly stimulated adrenal release of E and norepinephrine (NE) in three groups of acutely anephric dogs. Aortic catheters and adrenal vein to femoral vein Silastic shunts were placed in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital and mechanically ventilated. Adrenal secretion rates were calculated from adrenal vein to aorta catecholamine concentration differences divided by measured adrenal venous flow. Catecholamine concentrations were determined with trihydroxyindole technique. Blood samples were obtained before and 15, 30, and 60 min after rapid hemorrhage to a stable mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg. Saralasin infusion (10 microgram/kg/min) supported adrenal E release in anephric hemorrhaged dogs toward secretion rates comparable to those seen in intact dogs. Anephric SQ 20881 (approximately 0.5 microgram/kg) recipients had delayed (60 min) augmented adrenal E and NE release after hemorrhage. In resting animals not reflexly stimulated by hypovolemia, neither drug provoked adrenal E or NE release. These results suggest an agonist effect of saralasin on reflex adrenal E release and increased responsiveness of the stimulated adrenal medulla under the influence of converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "168": "The mechanism of the hypotensive response produced by inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme was studied in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. A recently developed potent inhibitor of the converting enzyme, SQ 14,225 (D-3-mercapto-2-methyl propanoyl-L-proline), administered i.v. to intact dogs resulted in a rapid marked decrease in blood pressure. In nephrectomized dogs, SQ 14,225 retained significant hypotensive activity, although the absolute magnitude of the decreases in blood pressure were less than had been observed in dogs with intact kidneys. SQ 14,225 also lowered blood pressure when administered to intact dogs in which angiotensin II receptors had been blocked with the receptor antagonist Sar1,Ala8-angiotensin II. This apparent ability of SQ 14,225 to decrease blood pressure in the absence of a functional renin angiotensin system was shared by a structurally dissimilar, nonapeptide, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20,881 (Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro). SQ 20,881 also produced significant decreases in blood pressure in nephrectomized dogs. These findings indicate that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, SQ 14,225 and SQ 20,881 may lower blood pressure in anesthetized normotensive dogs via a mechanism unrelated to either the renin angiotensin system or the renal kinin system.", 
    "169": "The renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the genesis of pre-eclampsia. To avoid fetal toxicity, five women were studied who developed hypertension, proteinuria, and edema in the last trimester of pregnancy and whose BP elevation persisted immediately postpartum. At about 6 hours after delivery the CE enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20,881) was given in incremental doses ranging from 0.25 to 3.0 mg. per kilogram intravenously, before and after diuresis with furosemide, 40 mg. intravenously. BP was measure every 2 minutes and PRA and angiotensin II concentration before treatment, 30 minutes after 0.25 to 0.30 mg. per kilogram, and 30 minutes after 2.0 to 3.0 mg. per kilogram. Echocardiographic assessment of CI and PVR was performed before treatment and after a maximum dose in three patients. Before diuresis, CE blockade had no effect on heart rate, BP, CI, PVR, or PRA, regardless of whether the patient was in positive or negative fluid balance or was sodium loaded or restricted over the preceding 24 hours. Angiotensin II fell by 77 and 10 per cent, respectively, after 0.25 mg. per kilogram was given to two patients, but rose slightly in the other three patients, then fell an average of 46 per cent after 1.0 to 3.0 mg. per kilogram were given. After diuresis, 1.0 mg. per kilogram resulted in a 24 per cent fall in BP which persisted for 3 hours in two patients and a 14 per cent fall which lasted for 30 minutes after 1.0 or 3.0 mg. per kilogram in a third patient. It is concluded that the BP elevation which persists after delivery in certain patients with pre-eclampsia is not angiotensin II dependent.", 
    "170": "Saralasin, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is ineffective in reducing drinking after water-deprivation (WD). Angiotensin III has considerable dipsogenic potency. It may be formed without angiotensin II as an intermediate. To clarify whether angiotensin III formation masks a role for angiotensin in WD, 48 hr WD rats were infused via a lateral cerebroventricle with a) CSF, b) Saralasin, c) SQ 20,881, a converting enzyme inhibitor, or d) Saralasin + SQ. No drug effect on drinking was observed. The results demonstrate that angiotensin III is not required for WD drinking.", 
    "171": "The role of angiotensin II as mediator of the aldosterone response to short periods of sodium restriction was studied in rats by administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor to block formation of the octapeptide throughout the duration of decreased sodium intake. In control animals, short-term sodium restriction caused increased levels of adrenal receptors for angiotensin II, with enhancement of early and late steps in aldosterone biosynthesis and elevation of plasma aldosterone concentration. Each of these changes induced by sodium deficiency was abolished during blockade of angiotensin II formation by continuous infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14,225. The absolute dependence of adrenal glomerulosa cell responses on angiotensin II formation indicates that the renin-angiotensin system is the primary regulator of aldosterone secretion during physiological fluctuations in sodium intake.", 
    "172": "Synthetic angiotensins I and II (AI and AII) and natural eel angiotensin were injected with angiotensin antagonists into freshwater-adapted, unanesthetized American eels, Anguilla rostrata, in an attempt to characterize the vasopressor properties of angiotensins in a primitive vertebrate. A converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20,881, inhibited vasopressor responses to eel angiotensin (presumably AI) and [Val5,Ser9]AI, but not those to [Asn1,Val5]AII, suggesting that a converting enzyme-like substance may exist in eels. [Sar1,Thr8]AII (10 microgram/kg per min) and [Sar1,Ile8]AII (1 microgram/kg per min), which antagonize angiotensin's action in mammals, showed neither agonistic vasopressor nor antagonistic effects in eels against [Asn1,Val5]AII or eel angiotensin. [Tal8]AII ([8-thienylalanine]AII) and a higher dose of [Sar1,Ile8]AII increased eel aortic pressure themselves and reduced vasopressor responses to [Asn1,Val5]AII. This is presumably a nonspecific decrease in response during the agonistic phase of the analogs. Angiotensin receptors in the blood vessels of eels may differ from those in mammals. Alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs and reserpine partially inhibited the pressor effect of [Asn1,Val5]AII in eels.", 
    "173": "Urinary Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a known indicator of renal production, was measured by specific radioimmunoassay in 111 normal volunteers, 85 patients with essential hypertension, 6 with renovascular hypertension, and 23 patients with primary aldosteronism. Women excreted less PGE2 than men in both normotensive and hypertensive groups. When compared to normals, essential hypertensives demonstrated significantly lower PGE2 levels, with one third excreting less than 100 ng/24 hr, values usually seen only in subjects receiving the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, indomethacin. Normal PGE2 was seen in patients with renovascular hypertension, and levels were uninfluenced by treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ14225, Despite normalization of blood pressure and increased plasma renin activity. Normal PGE2 was also encountered in primary aldosteronism. These data indicate that impaired renal PGE2 biosynthesis is specific for human essential hypertension, and is not secondary to the elevated blood pressure. Although PGE2 excretion tends to be lower in low-renin hypertension, a constant relationship between PGE2 and renin is not always apparent.", 
    "174": "Antiontensin-converting enzyme (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) has been solubilized from canine pulmonary particles and purified to apparent homogeneity. A value of approx. 140000 was estimated for the molecular weight of the native and the reduced, denatured forms of the enzyme. No free NH2-terminal residue was detected by the dansylation procedure. Carbohydrate accounted for 17% of the weight of the enzyme, and the major residues were galactose, mannose and N-acetylglucosamine with smaller amounts of sialic acid and fucose. Removal of sialic acid residues with neuraminidase did not alter enzymatic activity. The enzyme contained one molar equivalent of zinc. Addition of this metal reversed stimulation and inhibition of activity observed in the presence of Co2+ and Mn2+, respectively. Immunologic homology of pure dog and rabbit enzymes was demonstrable with goat antisera. Fab fragments and intact IgG antibodies displayed similar inhibition dose vs. response curves with homologous enzyme, whereas the fragments were poor inhibitors of heterologous activity compared to the holoantibodies. The canine glycoprotein was much less active than the rabbit preparation in catalyzing hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu. In contrast, the two enzymes exhibited comparable kinetic parameters with angiotensin I as substrate.", 
    "175": "We investigated the antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225 in 12 hypertensive patients for periods of three to 24 weeks. Blood pressure decreased in all patients (from 177 +/- 8/110 +/- 2 to 136 +/- 6/88 +/- 2 mm Hg--mean +/- S.E.); oral doses ranged from 400 to 1000 mg daily. Concomitant effects noted were small increases in plasma potassium concentration and pulse rate. One patient experienced a transient febrile reaction. Plasma renin activity rose during treatment, plasma aldosterone decreased, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme activity was virtually eliminated. There was no significant correlation between pretreatment plasma renin activity and degree of blood-pressure fall with SQ 14225. The exact mechanisms contributing to the blood-pressure-lowering effect of this agent remain unclear. SQ 14225 is a promising new antihypertensive agent, effective in patients refractory to traditional medical therapy.", 
    "176": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of the systemic and coronary circulations during sodium depletion was studied in conscious normotensive dogs by i.v. administration of teprotide (0.5 mg/kg), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and saralasin (0.05-5 mug/kg per min), an angiotensin-receptor antagonist. Sodium depletion was produced by administering a low sodium diet and furosemide for 5 days. Administration of both teprotide and saralasin lowered systemic arterial blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. Simultaneously, cardiac output increased, but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, dP/dt, and dP/dt/P did not change significantly. Furthermore, both agents reduced diastolic coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow, but did not affect myocardial oxygen consumption, left ventricular work, or myocardial efficiency. These systemic and coronary vasodilator effects of teprotide and saralasin, however, were not observed in normal dogs on a regular sodium diet; in this group, the only effect noted was a slight increase in arterial pressure during saralasin infusion. Arterial plasma concentration of norepinephrine did not differ between normal and sodiumdepleted dogs, nor did it change significantly after teprotide administration. These results suggest that, during salt depletion, angiotensin II exerts an active vasoconstrictor action on the systemic and coronary vessels, but has no significant effects on myocardial contractility or energetics. It also appears likely that the increase in cardiac output observed in sodiumdepleted dogs after angiotensin inhibition was caused, at least in part, by the decrease in systemic arterial pressure.", 
    "177": "The mechanism by which the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide (SQ 20881), lowers blood pressure was assessed in anesthetized normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Teprotide always was administered at a maximally effective dose of 1 mg/kg. In six normal Wistar rats, teprotide lowered blood pressure only after sodium depletion, an effect which was abolished by bilateral nephrectomy. Saralasin infusion (5 microgram/kg/min) into salt-depleted normal rats induced a blood pressure effect similar to that of teprotide. When administered in addition to saralasin infusion, teprotide did not reduce blood pressure further in normal rats or in SHR. When blood pressure of normal rats was raised by angiotensin II infusion (200 ng/kg/min), teprotide did not affect the induced blood pressure increase. In contrast, the pressure rise induced by angiotensin I infusion (230 ng/kg/min) was reversed by saralasin, but again concomitant administration of teprotide did not induce further blood pressure reduction. Thus, under the particular conditions of the present study, teprotide did not appear to exert its hypotensive effect by any mechanism other than inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, given at a maximally effective dose to the rat, it produced no greater vasodepressor effect than did saralasin.", 
    "178": "To determine its utility as an aid in diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, we administered nonapeptide converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI) (which inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II) (0.25 mg per kilogram) to 14 unselected hypertensive patients undergoing bilateral renal-vein catheterization. In seven (Group I) predominantly unilateral disease was discovered by angiography (renal-artery stenosis in six and hydronephrosis in one); in the remaining seven (Group II) no rennal-artery abnormality was found. In Group I, mean (+/- S.E.) ratio of involved to uninvolved renal-vein plasma renin activity (PRA) increased from 2.94 +/- 0.91 before to 8.36 +/- 2.94 after CEI (P less than 0.01). In Group II, the ratio (of the initially higher to the lower side) was 1.99 +/- 0.49 before and 1.17 +/- 0.07 after CEI (P greater 0.02). Post-CEI PRA was predicted by pretreatment PRA. Mean blood pressure fell in both groups after CEI, and the decrement was predicted by pre-CEI PRA. These data suggest that CEI can be of use at the time of renal-vein catheterization, serving to increase diagnostic accuracy by increasing the difference in PRA between the two sides when there is unilateral disease.", 
    "179": "The mechanism whereby the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II (AII) is influenced by sodium balance or disease is unclear. To explore this question, the renal vascular responses (RVR) to intrarenal injections of subpressor doses of AII and norepinephrine were studied in dogs with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Acute and chronic sodium depletion increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and blunted the RVR to AII, while acute sodium repletion and chronic sodium excess plus desoxycorticosterone acetate decreased PRA and enhanced the RVR to AII. The magnitude of the RVR to AII was inversely related to PRA. The RVR to norepinephrine was unaffected by sodium balance and was not related to PRA. Inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to AII by SQ 20,881 during sodium depletion lowered mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), increased renal blood flow (RBF), and enhanced the RVR to AII but not to norepinephrine. Administration of bradykinin to chronically sodium-depleted dogs also lowered the MABP and increased RBF but had no effect on the RVR to AII. SQ 20,881 had no effect on MABP, RBF, or the RVR to AII in the dogs with chronic sodium excess and desoxycorticosterone acetate. Administration of indomethacin to chronically sodium-depleted dogs lowered RBF but did not influence the RVR to AII. The results indicate that the RVR to AII is selectively influenced by sodium balance and that the magnitude of the response is inversely related to the availability of endogenous AII. The data did not suggest that the variations in the RVR to AII were because of direct effects of sodium on vascular contraction, changes in the number of vascular AII receptors, or the renal prostaglandins. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the vasoconstrictor effect of AII in the renal vasculature is primarily dependent upon the degree to which the AII vascular receptors are occupied by endogenous hormone.", 
    "180": "SQ 14,225 (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) markedly lowered the blood pressure of the renin-dependent aortic-ligated and two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive rat and failed to reduce blood pressure in the one-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive rat. In the two-kidney Goldblatt rat, SQ 14,225 (p.o.) was about 10 times as potent as teprotide, the nonapeptide SQ 20,881 (s.c.). Oral doses of SQ 14,225 moderately reduced the blood pressure of the Wistar-Kyoto spontaneously hypertensive rat but not that of the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat. Bilateral nephrectomy abolished the antihypertensive activity of SQ 14,225 in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. SQ 14,225 and SQ 20,881 elicited parallel dose-response curves in the two-kidney renal hypertensive rat. Post-treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with either agent failed to augment the antihypertensive effect produced by effective doses of the other agent. The results suggest that SQ 14,225 acts primarily by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system to reduce elevated blood pressure, especially in presumably renin-dependent models of hypertension.", 
    "181": "The effects of the infusion of Saralasin and SQ 20881, two drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, on the norepinephrine (NE) concentration in hypothalamus and medulla oblongata were studied in male Wistar rats. NE content increased in hypothalamus in response to both drugs, without changes in medulla oblongata catecholamine concentration. These results showed that the NE concentration of certain areas of the central nervous system can be modified, in a short time, by the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Results observed after the infusion of Saralasin could indicate that the receptors, on which the angiotensin acts to produce this alteration, are similar to those of the peripheral blood vessels.", 
    "182": "Nine sodium replete hypertensive patients with normal or high plasma renin activity (PRA) were given SQ 20.881, 1 mg/kg intravenously BP fell significantly within 20 min and reached its lowest level after 60 min. Blood kinins showed a minor but significant decrease after 60 and 105 min. Plasma angiotensin II was markedly reduced after 15 and 60 min. PRA was significantly increased after 15-105 min. Plasma aldosterone was reduced at 60 min in eight patients and slightly increased in one. Plasma noradrenaline increased after 15 min, whereas adrenaline decreased after 60 min. These results indicate that the reduction of BP following inhibition of converting enzyme by SQ 20.881, 1 mg/kg, is not related to reduced degradation of kinins but rather to decreased formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II appears to be of importance for the maintenance of BP in sodium replete hypertensive patients with normal or high PRA.", 
    "183": "Angiotensin II was infused at rates varying from 0.1 to 10 ng/kg per minute into 49 subjects with hypertension and 26 normotensive subjects and changes in blood pressure, plasma angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity (PRA) were determined after 20 and 30 minutes at each dose. Similar dose-related increases in angiotensin II and blood pressure occurred with a threshold of 1 ng/kg per minute in the normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Whereas angiotensin II induced a significant, dose-related decrement in renin activity in the normotensive subjects, with a threshold of 1.0 ng/kg per minute, no significant change in renin activity occurred in either the normal-renin or high-renin hypertensive subjects. In a separate study, nine normotensive and six hypertensive sodium-restricted subjects were given a converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20881, 30 microgram/kg. Despite a significantly greater fall in blood pressure (P less than 0.006) and angiotensin II concentration (P less than 0.045) in the hypertensive subjects, they did not have a greater rise in plasma renin activity. We conclude that angiotensin II reduces renin release in normal man at infusion rates that yield plasma angiotensin II levels within the physiological range but has a strikingly reduced influence on renin release in hypertension. In high-renin hypertension due to renal artery stenosis or nephrosclerosis, renin release is presumed to be relatively autonomous because of a dominant, intrarenal mechanism. The mechanism in normal-renin essential hypertension is not clear, but the abnormality could well be related to the pathogenesis of the hypertension.", 
    "184": "Brattleboro rats homozygous for hypothalamic hereditary diabetes insipidus (DI rats) were used to investigate the following questions: a) Do exogenous and endogenous angiotensin II (AII) have an antidiuretic effect in diabetes insipidus? b) Does AII mediate the antidiuresis induced by furosemide? The following results were obtained: 1. AII (5 mg/kg s.c. in oil) and furosemide (50 mg/kg i.p.) decreased urine flow and increased urinary sodium excretion. Furosemide led to a two-fold increase of AII plasma concentrations and a decrease of plasma sodium levels. 2. SQ 14 225 (2 x 2.5 mg/kg p.o.), an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, led to an increase of urine flow and to a slightly elevated urinary sodium excretion. 3. When the formation of AII was blocked by SQ 14 225 (2 x 2.5 mg/kg p.o.), AII plasma concentrations were 2.5-fold decreased, but furosemide still reduced urine flow. We conclude that plasma AII might have an antidiuretic action in DI rats. However, AII does not mediate the antidiuresis induced by furosemide.", 
    "185": "Injection of saralasin or converting-enzyme inhibitor produced a small variable reduction of blood-pressure in rats with two-kidney hypertension. Prolonged infusion of the inhibitors gradually reduced blood-pressure to normal. Control infusions of saralasin in normal animals and of dextrose in normal and hypertensive animals did not reduce blood-pressure. Plasma-renin concentration correlated significantly with the early but not with the later fall of blood-pressure. Plasma-concentrations of renin and angiotensin II were closely related except in rats receiving converting-enzyme inhibitor, when angiotensin II was relatively reduced. The gradual reduction of arterial pressure by saralasin was not associated with increased urinary sodium excretion.", 
    "186": "The cardiovascular pharmacology of SQ 14,225 (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline), a new orally effective inhibitor of angiotensin-coverting enzyme (ACE) was investigated in conscious normotensive rabbits. Intravenous administration of SQ 14,225 (3.1-310.0 microgram/kg) resulted in a dose related inhibition of the pressor responses to 310 ng/kg, i.v. of angiotensin I (AI) without diminishing the pressor responses to 100 ng/kg, i.v. of angiotensin II (AII). In fact, the responsiveness of the rabbits to AII was significantly enhanced by higher doses of SQ 14,225. This enhancement of the pressor effects of AII was found to be related to the inhibition of ACE and the resulting decrease in the levels of endogenous AII. In addition, SQ 14,225 (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) markedly potentiated the magnitude and duration of the vasodepressor responses elicited by bradykinin (1.0 microgram/kg. i.v.). At a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. i.v., SQ 14,225 had no effect on the vasodepressor effects of intravenously administered isoproterenol (0.4 microgram/kg), acetylcholine (1.0 microgram/kg) or prostaglandin E2 (3.0 microgram/kg, i.v.). The pressor responses to norepinephrine (3.0 microgram/kg, i.v.) were similarly unaffected by SQ 14,225 (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.). In normal rabbits SW 14,225 (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) caused a small but significant decrease in arterial pressure; it had no such effect in anephric rabbits. The observation of this study indicate that SQ, 14,225 is a specific inhibitor of ACE in conscious rabbits.", 
    "187": "Although lead and SQ20881 are potent in vitro inhibitors of kininase II activity, SQ20881 does not alter the sensitivity of rats to endotoxin. These results indicate that marked changes in plasma kininase activity do not contribute to endotoxin morbidity and that kininase inhibition is not the mechanism whereby lead ions sensitize rats to endotoxin.", 
    "188": "Prevention of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by means of a converting enzyme inhibitor, the nonapeptide SQ 20.881, in chronic hypertensive mice was followed by a drop in blood pressure in all mice independent of the ethiology of hypertension; in conscious normotensive mice was observed a significant decrease in blood pressure, which, however, was less than that observed in the hypertensive mice.", 
    "189": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme on endocrine responses and renal perfusion in haemorrhagic shock. Plasma levels of vasopressin (VP), aldosterone, and plasma renin activity (PRA), and renal cortical tissue blood flow were measured both in control dogs and in those treated with an inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme (SQ20881). The drug was administered with an intention of preventing vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II and to improve tissue perfusion. No significant differences were found in plasma levels of vasopressin, aldosterone and plasma renin activity between control and SQ20881-treated groups. Secondary elevation of blood pressure following haemorrhage was significantly delayed and reduced by the administration of the inhibitor. Decrease in renal cortical tissue blood flow was observed in the SQ20881-treated group. It is suggested that angiotension II appears to play a role in spontaneous recovery of arterial blood pressure following haemorrhage. Furthermore, angiotensin II does not seem to play an important role in the stimulation of secretion of vasopressin in response to haemorrhage. Our data failed to demonstrate any favourable effects of inhibition of angiotension I converting enzyme on renal perfusion during haemorrhagic shock in dogs.", 
    "190": "Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured with a noncannulating electromagnetic flow transducer in anesthetized rats which had been maintained for 3-5 wk on low, normal, or high salt plus deoxycorticosterone diets. After base-line observations, one of two dissimilar inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 or the structural analogue [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II was administered intravenously. The employed doses of SQ 20881 and [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II effectively inhibited the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses induced by exogenous angiotensin I and II, respectively, in each dietary group. Both inhibitors vasodilated kidneys in salt-restricted rats; however, neither affected base-line renal hemodynamics in salt-loaded rats. Pressure-flow relationships were evaluated by clamping the aorta to reduce renal perfusion pressure. Renal blood flow was autoregulated between 100 and 140 mmHg with the same efficiency before and during inhibition of angiotensin II in each dietary group. These data indicate that angiotensin II modifies base-line RBF and renal vascular resistance and are consistent with the view that the renin-angiotensin system is not an essential mechanism responsible for autoregulation of RBF in the rat.", 
    "191": "We assessed the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the response of the renal circulation to restriction of sodium intake in 38 normal patients. Both saralasin (10 to 30 ng/kg/min), an angiotensin antagonist, and SQ 20881 (30 to 300microgram/kg), a converting enzyme inhibitor, induced a dose-related increase in renal blood flow (xenon 133 washout) only when the resin-angiotension system was activated by restriction of sodium intake to 10 MEq/day. Increasing doses of saralasin (100 to 1,000 ng/kg/min) reduced renal blood flow, presumably due to the angiotensin-like action of this partial agonist. The renal vascular response to SQ 20881 paralleled the endocrine response: An identical threshold dose (30 microgram/kg) increased renal blood flow and reduced plasma angiotensin II concentration, which fell despite a progressive rise of plasma renin activity. Plasma bradykinin concentration did not change in response to SQ 20881, which also blocks kininase II. Both agents also induced a small but consistent and statistically significant reduction in arterial blood pressure, which will be important in assessing the pathogenetic significance of a blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension. This study indicates that angiotensin mediates the renal vascular response to restriction of salt intake in normal man and provides an approach to assessing the role played by angiotensin in the pathogenesis of functional renal disease.", 
    "192": "Experiments were conducted in chloralose-anesthetized cats to investigate the central and peripheral cardiovascular effects of a new orally active angiotensin-converting inhibitor, SQ 14,225 (3-mercapto-2-D-methylpropanoyl-L-proline). I.v. administration of SQ 14,225 (0.31-3100 microgram/kg) antagonized the pressor responses to angiotensin I (AI) (310 ng/kg) i.v. in a dose-related manner but did not alter responses to angiotensin II (AII) (200 ng/kg) i.v. Similarly, intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered SQ 14,225 (0.31-310 microgram/kg perfused over 10 min) produced dose-related decreases in the centrally mediated pressor responses and heart increases elicited by AI (310 ng/kg) i.c.v. The central responses to AII (200 ng/kg) i.c.v. were not affected by SQ 14,225. Passage of SQ 14,225 out of the ventricular system into the systemic circulation was detected, but only at doses greater than that required to antagonize central AI responses. Doses of SQ 14,225 (310 microgram/kg and 3.1 mg/kg) i.v. which maximally inhibited i.v. AI responses, had no effect upon central AI activity. This finding suggests that passage of SQ 14,225 across the blood brain barrier into the central nervous system is restricted. Peripheral or central administration of SQ 14,225 produced only minimal transient decreases in blood pressure (less than 10 mm Hg). The results of these studies indicate that SQ 14,225 is a potent inhibitor of AI conversion in the brain as well as in the peripheral circulation.", 
    "193": "The effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on the circulating levels of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and arginine vasopressin was studied in dogs subjected to hypotensive hemorrhagic shock. In dogs subjected to hemorrhage but not given the inhibitor, angiotensin II rose 20-fold (from 69 to 1,343 pg/ml of plasma), whereas in dogs subjected to hemorrhage but pretreated with the inhibitor, angiotensin II rose only 2-fold (from 92 to 171 pg/ml of plasma). In the pretreated dogs angiotensin I rose 30-fold (from 108 to 3,232 pg/ml of plasma). There was no statistically significant difference between the vasopressin levels found in the untreated dogs and the levels found in dogs given the inhibitor (1,016 and 1,095 pg/ml of plasma). Of the 15 dogs in the untreated group, five died before retransfusion was completed (four of cardiac failure and one of cardiac arrhythmia); none of the 10 dogs in the inhibitor-treated group died. These observations suggest that the very high levels of angiotensin II observed following severe hemorrhage do not contribute significantly to the increased secretion of vasopressin and that the inhibitor protects against death, possibly by suppressing the very high blood levels of angiotensin II observed following this type of experimental hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "194": "The effect of angiotensin I (AI), angiotensin II (AII), [des-asp1]AI, [des-asp1]AII and [des-asp1-arg2]AII on corticosteroid production in isolated fasciculata cells from bovine adrenals has been studied. AII and [des-asp1]AII in concentrations ranging from 10(-9)M to 10(-6)M had a potent stimulatory effect on steroid biosynthesis. The dose-response curves for both peptides were identical. AI was about 3 times less potent than AII and [des-asp1]AII. The effect of AI was not due to its conversion to AII. [Des-asp1]AI was as active as AI. No significant conversion to [des-asp1]AII was observed. [Des-asp1-arg2]AII had only a minimal effect on steroidogenesis. The structural analog [sar1,-ala8]AII inhibited all angiotensins specifically and competitively. The affinity of the cellular binding site was higher for AII and [des-asp1]AII than for [sar1,ala8]ALL, but lower for AI and [des-asp1]AI than for the inhibitor. Combination of submaximal doses of AI and AII resulted in an additive effect on steroid production. By contrast, combination of maximal doses of both peptides had the same effect as AII alone. These data demonstrate a potent steroidogenic activity for AII as well as AI, [des-asp1]AI and [des-asp1]AII in bovine adrenal fasciculata cells. A common receptor site for all four peptides is suggested.", 
    "195": "1. Prostaglandin E- and F-like material has been estimated in renal venous blood of the left kidney of anaesthetized rabbits following renal nerve section. Prostaglandins were estimated by bioassay following solvent extraction and column chromatography. 2. Electrical stimulation of the renal nerves of the left kidney to reduce renal blood flow by approximately 15% for 15 min resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of prostaglandin E-like material in the renal venous blood. The peak values were normally seen either in the last 5 min of the stimulation period or in the first 5 min after the end of the stimulation period. The concentration of prostaglandin F-like material was not significantly altered. 3. Similar reduction of renal blood flow of the left kidney by renal artery constriction also resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of prostaglandin E- but not F-like material in renal venous blood. The timing and magnitude of the response was comparable with that observed with renal nerve stimuation. 4. The effect of an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20881, on the response to both renal nerve stimulation and renal artery constriction has been studied. The administration of the drug did not significantly reduce the release of prostaglandins from the denervated kidneys, however, the increase in prostaglandin E-like material, in response to both stimuli, was abolished. 5. The results suggest that the increase in prostaglandin E-like material released from the kidney in response to low frequency stimulation or to modest reductions in renal blood flow is dependent on the release of renin and that the effect is mediated by the formation of angiotensin II and not angiotensin I.", 
    "196": "Changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) produced by renal arterial hypotension were studied in conscious, adrenalectomized dogs maintained on low-, normal-, or high-Na diet during constant steroid replacement therapy. In animals maintained on a low-Na diet, reduction of renal perfusion pressure to 50 mmHg for 45 min increased MAP 40 +/- 3 (SE) mmHg, while PRA rose rapidly by 36.5 +/- 6 ng ml-1 h-1. Similar renal hypotension in dogs maintained on a normal-Na diet increased MAP only 21 +/- 3 mmHg while PRA rose 5.5 +/- 0.9 ng ml-1 h-1; dogs on high-Na intake had a 6 +/- 1 mmHg pressure rise without a significant change in PRA. The rise in MAP correlated well with the log deltaPRA. Calculated open-loop gain was -1.2, -0.7, and -0.1 in dogs on low-, normal-, and high-Na diets, respectively. Nonpeptide angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) reversed the elevated MAP observed during reduction of renal perfusion pressure in dogs on low- and normal-Na diets, but had little effect in dogs on high-Na intake. These observations suggest that the renin-angiotensin system becomes quantitatively more important in the regulation of blood pressure as Na intake is reduced.", 
    "197": "We assessed vascular and hormonal responses to inhibition of peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (converting enzyme) and degrades bradykinin (kininase II), in subjects given 10 meq of sodium to activate both systems. In nine normal subjects a threshold dose of 30 MICROgram per kilogram of the inhibitor, SQ 20881, modestly influenced mean blood pressure (-5 +/- 1 mm Hg, P less than 0.05), and renal blood flow (+50+/-8 ml per 100 g per minute), plasma renin activity (+ 2.3 +/- 0.6 ng per milliliter per hour), and angiotensin II (-11 +/- 3 pg per milliliter) more strikingly (P less than 0.01). In six patients with essential hypertension the threshold inhibitor dose was reduced to 10 microgram per kilogram; 30 kilogram per kilogram had an enhanced (P less than 0.01) effect on mean blood pressure (-11 +/- 2 mm Hg), renal blood flow (137 +/- 20 ml per 100 g per minute), and angiotensin II concentration (-29 +/- 12 pg per milliliter). SQ 20881 elevated plasma bradykinin concentration (7.4 +/- 2.6 ng per milliliter, P less than 0.02) only in the hypertensive patients. Because both renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-bradykinin systems are influenced, vascular responses to SQ 20881 must be interpreted cautiously, but this agent has excellent antihypertensive characteristics.", 
    "198": "To assess relationships between plasma bradykinin and the individual elements of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 11 normal subjects and five subjects with adrenal insufficiency were studied on an intake of 200 mEq sodium/100 mEq potassium. In adrenal insufficiency subjects, plasma bradykinin did not change when angiotensin II levels were increased by an infusion rate of 3 ng/kg per min for 30 minutes; plasma aldosterone remained undetectabel. In normal subjects, angiotensin II at 3 ng/kg per min or potassium at 20 mEq/hour infused intravenously for 2 hours both significantly increased plasma aldosterone levels, yet neither stimulus altered plasma bradykinin. Thus, acute elevations in angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone were not associated with changes in the levels of plasma bradykinin. In five additional normal subjects on an intake of 10 mEq sodium/100 mEq potassium, a threshold dose of converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20881) at 30 microng/kg was given intravenously. Five minutes after administration of the drug, blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II levels had significantly declined and plasma bradykinin levels had significantly increased (P is less than 0.02). Within 10-20 minutes, however, all had returned to control accompanied by a sustained increase in plasma renin activity, and a decrement in plasma aldosterone. Plasma renin activity, which had increased by more than 2-fold after the administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor, remained elevated until the completion of the study at 320 minutes. Eighty minutes after beginning the infusion, plasma aldosterone levels returned to control. Thus, the results suggest that plasma bradykinin correlates more closely with acute changes in plasma renin activity (and angiotensin I) than plasma aldosterone or angiotensin II, suggesting a role for converting enzyme in the regulation of both plasma renin activity and plasma bradykinin. Furthermore, the declines in blood pressure observed with converting enzyme inhibition may be attributable to both changes in plasma angiotensin II and plasma bradykinin concentrations. However, it is emphasized that these short-term studies may not reflect the role of bradykinin in the long-term control of blood pressure.", 
    "199": "The aldosterone and arterial pressure response to long-term infusion of two angiotensin II inhibitory analogues, [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II and [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II, and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20,881, was studied in conscious dogs during sodium deficiency. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma cortisol concentration (PCC), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were determined by radioimmunoassay. In conscious dogs after dietary sodium restriction (5 mEq of Na+/day) for 21 days, PAC averaged 37.5 +/- 8.9 (mean +/- SE) ng/dl, PCC averaged 1.3 +/- 0.5 microng/dl, PRA averaged 3.23 +/- 0.42 ng/ml per hour, and arterial blood pressure (AP) averaged 103 +/- 5 mm Hg. During long-term infusion of [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (5 microng/kg min-1), PAC averaged 34.7 +/- 8.5 ng/dl, PCC averaged 1.5 +/- 0.5 microng/dl, PRA averaged 16.4 +/- 3.1 ng/ml per hour, and AP averaged 88 +/- 5 mm Hg. During long-term infusion of [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II (5 microng/kg min-1), PAC averaged 45.8 +/- 12.6 ng/dl, PCC averaged 1.75 +/- 0.5 microng/dl, PRA averaged 13.6 +/- 4.3 ng/ml per hour, and AP averaged 86 +/- 5 mm Hg. During long-term infusion of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (5 microng/kg min-1), PAC averaged 14.9 +/- 4.8 ng/dl, PCC averaged 1.75 +/- 0.5 microng/dl, PRA averaged 20.3 +/- 5.3 ng/ml per hour, and AP averaged 76 +/- 5 mm Hg. The intrinsic agonistic properties of the angiotensin II inhibitory analogues on the adrenal cortex negate their use for defining the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of aldosterone biosynthesis during sodium deficiency. The precipitous fall in aldosterone secretion and arterial blood pressure during long-term infusion of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor demonstrates the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating aldosterone biosynthesis during sodium deficiency and the essential role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the regulation of arterial pressure during sodium deficiency.", 
    "200": "1. Angiotensin I converting enzyme from horse plasma has been extensively purified and shown to be homogeneous by disc-gel electrophoresis. 2. The metal ion involved in the catalytic reaction of the enzyme has been identified for the first time as zinc by atomic absorption spectrometry. 3. A number of other physicochemical properties of the enzyme are described and compared with results obtained by other investigators. The molecular weight was determined by gel filtration to be 113 000 daltons. The pH maximum was found to be 7-4. The chloride activation of the enzyme appears to act by facilitation of substrate binding to the enzyme. 4. By use of enzyme inhibitors, tyrosine has been implicated as a functional residue at the active site of the enzyme. 5. The enzyme shows a fairly high degree of specificity towards its substrates.", 
    "201": "A hypothetical model of the active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme, based on known chemical and kinetic properties of the enzyme, has enabled us to design a new class of potent and specific inhibitors. These compounds, carboxyalkanoyl and mercaptoalkanoyl derivatives of proline, inhibit the contractile response of guinea pig ileal strip to angiotensin I and augment its response to bradykinin. When administered orally to rats, these agents inhibit the pressor effect of angiotensin I, augment the vasodepressor effect of bradykinin, and lower blood pressure in a model of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "202": "An orally active inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, SQ 14,225 (D-2-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoly-L-proline), was administered to fourteen normal male volunteers to evaluate its safety and efficacy in inhibiting pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I. SQ 14,225 produced significant blockade within 15 min of oral administration. The magnitude and duration of inhibition were dose-related. After a dose of 20 mg, complete blockade was observed for more than 2 h and partial inhibition for over 4 h. There was no effect on pressor responses to angiotensin II. SQ 14,225 promises to provide a new approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving over-activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "203": "We determined the effects of indomethacin and meclofenamate, two inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, on renal vascular resistance and on renal responses to nerve stimulation, pressor and depressor hormones in the in situ feline kidney under conditions of controlled blood flow. Both inhibitors produced a gradual rise in renal vascular resistance which became maximal 15-20 minutes after administration. The increase in renal resistance after indomethacin was not attenuated during intrarenal infusion of either phentolamine or SQ 20881. Pretreatment with propranolol, in a dose sufficient to inhibit renin secretion, also did not attenuate the increase in renal resistance produced by indomethacin. However, infusion of [Sar1-, Ala8]angiotensin II, an angiotensin II antagonist, did attenuate the indomethacin-induced increase in renal vascular resistance. After indomethacin, the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine was enhanced, whereas responses to nerve stimulation and angiotensin were unaffected. Although meclofenamate enhanced renal vascular resistance, its effects on vasoconstrictor responses were inconsistent. After indomethacin, the renal dilator response to bradykinin was enhanced; however, dilator responses to nitroglycerin were unaltered. The present data indicate that the increase in renal vascular resistance after indomethacin does not depend on the adrenergic system but may be dependent on the renin-angiotensin system. The inconsistent effect of the inhibitors of synthesis on renal constrictor responses to nerve stimulation suggests that endogenous prostaglandins do not serve to modulate the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the feline renal vascular bed. These results also indicate that renal dilator responses to bradykninin are not mediated by prostaglandins in the cat.", 
    "204": "Cultured endothelial cells provide a model for the study of interactions of vasoactive peptides with endothelium. Endothelial cell cultured from veins of human umbilical cords contain both angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) and angiotensinase activities. Intact monolayers of cells can both activate angiotensin I and inactivate bradykinin when the peptides are added to culture flasks in protein-free medium. Intact suspended cells or lysed cells convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II, inactivate bradykinin, and hydrolyze hippuryldiglycine to hippuric acid and diglycine. These actions are inhibited by SQ 20881, the specific inhibitor of converting enzyme. The kininase activity of endothelial cells was partially inhibited by antibody to human lung converting enzyme. Endothelial cells also inactivate longer analogs of bradykinin, such as kallidin, methionyl-lysyl bradykinin, and bradykinin coupled covalently to 500,000 mol wt dextran. The endothelial cells retained converting enzyme activity through four successive subcultures, indicating that the enzyme is synthesized by the cells surface, and it is apparently a marker for endothelial cells, since cultured human fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and baby hamster kidney cells do not have it. Endothelial cells also contain an aminopheptidase which hydrolyzes both angiotensin II and the synthetic substrate, alpha-L-aspartyl beta-naphthylamide. The angiotensinase activity increased when the cells were lysed, which suggests that the enzyme is localized within the cells, Hydrolysis of both alpha-L-aspartyl beta-naphthylamide and angiotensin II was inhibited by omicron-phenanthroline, indicating that the enzyme is an A-tipe anigotensinase.", 
    "205": "To understand the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis of human hypertension, in serial studies we have blocked the system using three different pharmacologic probes: 1) reduction of renin secretion by administration of the beta receptor blocker, propranolol; 2) blockade of the action of angiotensin II by infusion of saralasin, a competitive antagonist of angiotensin II; and 3) blockade of the enzymatic conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by infusing a nonapeptide competitive inhibitor. The depressor responses induced by either propranolol or the nonapeptide expose a significant to major involvement of excess renin--angiotensin in maintaining the hypertension of some 50 to 70% of common forms of hypertension including \"essential\" hypertension. This subgroup includes nearly all patients with high or \"normal\" renin--sodium profiles. The considerably lower estimates for a renin factor in essential hypertension suggested by saralasin testing now appear due to the partial agonism of this drug. Further studies are required to determine whether this relative or absolute excess of renin secretion is primarily involved in the hypertension and if not why it fails to shut itself off. Similar studies of normal subjects are also needed to determine whether renin support of blood pressure is proportionately greater or less than in hypertensive subjects. Meanwhile the validation provided by these three different pharmacologic probes portends a burgeoning clinical role for renin--sodium profiling not only in screening for renal and adrenal cortical hypertensions but also for characterizing the vasoconstrictor and volume elements involved in various individual patients and thus enabling more specific treatments of the various subtypes of essential hypertension.", 
    "206": "The angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II; peptidyl dipeptidase; EC3.4.15.1) has a dual function: it converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and it inactivates bradykinin. Lung, kidney, guinea pig plasma and testicles are among the richest sources of the enzyme. Vascular endothelial cells and bursh borders of renal proximal tubular cells contain high concentrations of the enzyme. The availability of synthetic peptide inhibitors was a great help in establishing the function of converting enzyme in normal and pathological conditions.", 
    "207": "To block renin activity, a nonapeptide converting-enzyme inhibitor was given to 65 seated hypertensive patients. Depressor responses occurred only when control plasma renin activity exceeded 2 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour and correlated directly in amplitude with control plasma renin activity and with induced increments in activity (P less than 0.001 for both). Depressor responses, like renin activity, were characteristic for renin subgroups as defined by renin-sodium profiling. Before and after sodium deprivation, the nonapeptide reduced diastolic pressure in all patients with high renin (by 17.3 and 19.8 per cent) and most patients with normal renin (by 9.1 and 17.7 per cent). Low-renin patients remained unresponsive. This enzyme blockade may cause bradykinin accumulation. But if, as seems likely, depressor responses are due to blockade of angiotensin II formation, the results indicate that, irrespective of sodium balance, measurements of plasma renin activity reflect its contribution to blood-pressure maintenance. The results suggest broad participation of the renin system in common forms of hypertension.", 
    "208": "Crude kallikrein (Padutin), but not pure kallikrein, when preincubated with angiotensin I caused a potentiation of the myotropic effect of decapeptide on the isolated continuously superfused rabbit aortic strip. Addition of converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20881, to the medium inhibited this potentiation. The potentiation by crude kallikrein of the myotropic effect of angiotensin I is probably due to the conversion of decapeptide to octapeptide angiotensin II. This study indicates that Padutin is not a pure kallikrein preparation and probably contains a kininase fraction which causes the conversion of angiotensin I.", 
    "209": "1. Blood pressure and plasma renin activity were studied after bilateral nephrectomy in groups of rats with hypertension caused by unilateral renal ischaemia with the opposite kidney left intact. 2. Although blood pressure showed only a small fall in the first hour after bilateral nephrectomy, plasma renin activity fell rapidly with a half-life of 10 min. 3. Infusion of converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ20881) produced a 26-1% fall in blood pressure 1 h after nephrectomy, 24-% at 2 h and 4-6% at 6 h. 4. An angiotensin antagonist (Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II) was infused into hypertensive rats 1 h after nephrectomy; this blocked the vasodepressor action of the converting enzyme inhibitor, indicating that the fall in blood pressure produced by the inhibitor was due to its action upon the renin-angiotensin system. 5. The renin-angiotensin system maintains blood pressure in this model even after plasma renin has fallen to insignificant levels. This supports the view that vascular renin activity has a longer half-life than circulating renin and is important in the control of blood pressure.", 
    "210": "Converting enzyme activity was studied in endothelial cells, isolated from pig pulmonary arteries and aorta by exposure to collagenase. The measure was based on the release of His-Leu from Z-Phe-His-Leu was related to the DNA content of the cellular suspension. The same activity was found in the two types of endothelium: 1 nmol His-Leu/mug DNA per 30 min. Subendothelial cells showed a very low activity, amounting to 10% of the value found for the endothelium. The enzyme activity was 2inhibited by the nonapeptide SQ 20881, EDTA, and the lack of Cl- in the same fashion for the two types of endothelium. The presence of another enzyme hydrolyzing His-Leu was detected in both endothelial populations. Isolated fragments of plasma membrane, however, exhibited only converting enzyme activity. It can be concluded that endothelial cells isolated from large vessels of the pulmonary and the systemic circulations have similar properties when dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity is measured.", 
    "211": "The effects of intrarenal infusion of 1-sar-8-ala angiotension II (P 113) and a converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20881, at doses that did not affect systemic blood pressure (2.0 mug/kg per min) were studied in conscious, uninephrectomized dogs. In dogs receiving approximately equal to 5 mEq/day of sodium, intrarenal infusion of P 113 increased renal blood flow (RBF) from 219.8 +/- 32.3 to 282.7 +/- 20.0 ml/min (P less than 0.004), and with intrarenal SQ 20881 infusion from 215.3 +/- 14.2 to 278.0 +/- 22.2 ml/min (p less than 0.005). In sodium-restricted dogs (approximately equal to 5 mEq/day), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) also increased with intrarenal P 113 infusion from 57.9 +/- 5.7 to 66.3 +/- 6.6 ml/min (P less than 0.05), and with SQ 20881 infusion from 43.1 +/- 2.1 to 55.7 +/- 4.5 ml/min (P less than 0.01). Dogs on approximately equal to 5 mEq/day of sodium showed significant increases in plasma renin activity (PRA) with intrarenal infusion of the peptides, unmasking a negative feedback inhibition of renin release by angiotensin II. No increases in RBF, GFR, or PRA were seen with infusion without inhibitors, or in dogs give P 113 or SQ 20881 while on approximately equal to 80 mEq/day of sodium. In addition, angiotensin II inhibition increased sodium excretion during sodium restriction. These findings suggest that intrarenal angiotensin II is intimately involved in renal responses to sodium restriction which result in conservation of sodium and water.", 
    "212": "(1) An immediate pressor response so saralasin, 10 microgram/kg/min, occurred in 52 of 57 (91%) hypertensive patients. (2) We propose that the amplitude of the immediate pressor response functions as an in vivo measure of the number of initially vacan angiotensin II vascular receptors. (3) The immediate pressor response to saralasin forecasts the subsequent sustained response, both of which are related to the renin-sodium profile. (4) The dual blood pressure responses to saralasin, immediate and sustained, make this drug useful for the pharmacological identification of high, normal, and low renin hypertensive patients as they are presently classified. (5) The ability of saralasin to elevate the BP immediately in most hypertensive patients shows the need for caution in its use. It is a safe drug from this standpoint if very small infusions (0.01-0.10 microgram/kg/min) are first tried in hypertensive patients whose PRA is unknown.", 
    "213": "Peptidyldipeptide hydrolase [angiotensin I-converting enzyme, EC 3.4.15.1] was inhibited by inorganic and organic phosphorus compounds tested, except for beta-glycerophosphate, 5'-AMP, and 5'-ADP, at the reagent concentrations used. Orthophosphate and pyrophosphate nonspecifically inhibited the enzyme activity. The enzyme was also inhibited specifically by carboxylates. The degree of inhibition by aliphatic monocarboxylates increased in proportion to their chain length up to C14. Aromatic and omega-phenylalkylcarboxylates also inhibited the enzyme activity. The enzyme was noncompetitively inhibited by acetate, 3-phenylpropionate and laurate. The Ki's for acetate, 3-phenylpropionate, and laurate were 60, 3.3, and 2.5 mM, respectively.", 
    "214": "One of several novel peptidic inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (CEI) has been studied intravenously both in normal male volunteers and severely hypertensive patients without any clinically significant adversity or intolerance. Hypertensive patients experienced a significant yet gradual reduction in resting arterial pressure without hypotension. The addition of a diuretic agent was observed to potentiate this antihypertensive effect. Normal, sodium replete volunteers received this nonapeptide intravenously in doses up to 2-0 mg/kg without any significant cardiovascular effect. Both patients and normal subjects exhibited reversible dose related increases in angiotensin I and renin levels after receiving the peptide. The plasma renin response to tilting was also potentiated by CEI. These findings suggest that intravenous CEI may be of value in the treatment of severely elevated hypertension and as a tool to evaluate vasoconstrictor and volume factors in hypertension.", 
    "215": "The steroidogenic and pressor activities of the nonapeptide (des-Asp1) angiotensin I [(des-Asp)-AI] were tested in conscious rats. (des-Asp)-AI caused dose related increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum aldosterone, and serum corticosterone in doses between 3 and 3,000 ng/kg/min. (des-Asp)-AI was 14% as potent as angiotensin I and angiotensin II and 60% as potent as (des-Asp1) angiotensin II [des-Asp)-AII] in raising MAP. (des-Asp)-AI was less active than AI, AII, or (des-Asp)-AII in causing increased release of aldosterone, possessing only 8%, 11%, and 17% of the potency of AII, (des-Asp)-AII, and AI, respectively. Each of these angiotensin peptides was equally potent in elevating serum corticosterone levels. Infusions of a nonapeptide inhibitor of converting enzyme (CEI, 0.5 mg/kg/min iv) did not alter control MAP or blood pressure responses to AII or (des-Asp-)-AII but inhibited equally the blood pressure effects of AI and (des-Asp)-AI. CEI also inhibited the ability of (des-Asp)-AI (67% inhibition) and AI (34% inhibition) to increase the serum aldosterone concentration, but had no effect on basal aldosterone levels. These data indicate that (des-Asp)-AI has pressor and steroidogenic effects, but requires conversion to (des-Asp)-AII for a major portion of its activity. These results further substantiate the hypothesis that (des-Asp)-AII, recently recognized as a hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, may be produced without the formation of AII as an intermediate and provide in vivo evidence for the conversion of (des-Asp)-AI to (des-Asp)-AII.", 
    "216": "Specific antagonists of the renin angiotensin system have been used to investigate the role of this hormonal system in blood pressure homeostasis and in different types of experimental and clinical hypertension. Using this approach it was possible to show that renin via angiotensin participates actively in blood pressure maintenace, particularly following sodium depletion. Such antagonists, if available for oral administration and taken together with a diuretic, would be useful therapeutically.", 
    "217": "Systemic injections of renin that stimulate substantial amounts of drinking in nephrectomized rats can produce plasma renin activities that fall well above the physiological range. Furthermore, increases in plasma renin activities that occur in rats with intact kidneys during experimental hypotension appear to be too low to provide the basis for the observed elevations in water intake. These findings question the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to thirst under normal physiological conditions.", 
    "218": "The spiny dogfish shark, which does not have renal juxtaglomerular cells, exhibits a strong pressor response to both angiotensin I and II. A nonapeptide, angiotensin I-converting-enzyme inhibitor, blocks the pressor response to angiotensin I in this fish. The pressor response to both angiotensin II and norepinephrine is completely blocked by the adrenergic blocking drug phentolamine.", 
    "219": "This study was designed to examine more closely the differences in blood pressure responses in hypertensive patients to two agents which block the renin-angiotensin system. Accordingly, 39 seated patients received under the same conditions both saralasin, an octapeptide competitive antagonist of angiotensin II, and the nonapeptide converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ20881, which blocks the generation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I. A second component of the study involved administration of these agents in 10 addtional studies in anephric subjects. Although both agents produced maximal responses in blood pressure that correlated well with each other (p less than 0.001) and with the pretreatment plasma renin levels (p less than 0.001), analysis of the results by renin subgroups revealed significant differences. Thus, both drugs lowered the diastolic pressures of patients with high renin levels, but but converting enzyme inhibitor produced changes of greater amplitude (p less than 0.05). In contrast, saralasin was consistently pressor in both patients with low renin levels and anephric patients in whom converting enzyme blockade preduced no significant changes in blood pressure. Another impressive disparity in the responses to the two agents occurred in the group with normal renin levels in whom saralasin produced either neutral or pressor responses (mean change was +2.0 +/- 1.5 standard error of the mean (SEM) per cent control diastolic pressure) whereas the converting enzyme inhibitor consistently induced depressor responses (mean change was -10.2 +/- 1.2 per cent, p less than 0.001). Altogether, the results suggest that converting enzyme inhibitor tests for angiotensin II-dependent blood pressure with more sensitivity than the partial agonist saralasin. Moreover, it is unlikely that the differences between the responses to the two agents were due to bradykinin accumulation, since depressor responses to converting enzyme inhibitor were not observed in the patients with low renin levels and the anephric patients.", 
    "220": "The role of the renin--angiotensin system in the regulation of blood pressure in dogs and in human subjects was assessed by the use of the nonapeptide converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), permitting the following conclusions: 1) In the normal, sodium replete dog, the renin--angiotensin system plays little role in the regulation of blood pressure. 2) As sodium depletion progresses, the renin--angiotensin system becomes increasingly important in the maintenance of blood pressure. In the markedly hypovolemic animal, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II leads to prolonged hypotension of shock-like levels. 3) The renin--angiotensin system is responsible for the initiation of renovascular hypertension. Blood pressure does not rise during chronic renal artery constriction when the generation of angiotensin II is prevented by the CEI. Although angiotensin II is essential for the initiation of the elevated blood pressure, the renin--angiotensin system plays a decreasing role in the maintenance of the chronic hypertension as sodium and water are retained, and plasma volume increases. 4) In congestive failure induced in the conscious dog by circulatory impairment, the renin--angiotensin--aldosterone system plays an essential role in the compensatory response. During chronic administration of the CEI, the animal cannot compensate even for a relatively mild degree of constriction, and remains hypotensive. In the dog with congestive failure, as in the dog with renovascular hypertension, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone are elevated early in the syndrome; during this phase, injection of the nonapeptide produces a marked drop in blood pressure. With the retention of sodium and water, and expansion of plasma and extravascular fluid volumes, PRA and plasma aldosterone return to control levels in the new steady state. The inhibitor no longer produces a drop in blood pressure. Thus, the sequential changes in the renin--angiotensin--aldosterone system are remarkably similar in renovascular hypertension and congestive failure. 5) In the normal, salt replete human subject the renin--angiotensin system plays little role in the regulation of blood pressure either in the recumbent or upright posture. However, with relatively mild sodium depletion, the CEI transiently lowers blood pressure even in the recumbent subject. In the absence of angiotensin II such sodium-depleted subjects are unable to compensate when tilted upright, and faint within minutes.", 
    "221": "In this review, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, both naturally occurring and synthetic, are considered. Inhibition of renin itself, of converting enzyme (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase), and of interaction with the receptor is characterized from the point of view of mechanism, structure-activity relations, and future developments. The concept of transition state analog and its relevance to the inhibition of renin by pepstatin is discussed. Questions concerning selectivity, increased affinity, and longer duration of action are raised with regard to future design of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "222": "The effect of pentobarbital anesthesia on plasma renin activity (PRA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was studied in chronically catheterized dogs maintained on normal or low-sodium intake. Within 1 min of administration, pentobarbital caused a rapid fall in MAP which was followed by a restoration of MAP toward control within 5 min. Thirty minutes after induction of anesthesia, PRA was unchanged in sodium-replete dogs and elevated two-fold in sodium-depleted dogs. MAP was significantly lowered (20 mmHg) in normal salt dogs and only slightly decreased in low-salt dogs 30 min after pentobarbital. MAP returned to preanesthetic control value in dogs given converting enzyme inhibitor before anesthesia. Surgical stress or cutaneous electrical stimulation causey hexamethonium. These results indicate that change in PRA and MAP of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs is significantly influenced by the sodium intake of the animal and by the degree of surgical stress.", 
    "223": "While hypotension elicited a marked increase in plasma renin concentration in conscious normal mice, no increase was provoked in previously nephrectomized mice in spite of the high renin content of their submaxillary glands. The role of the increased release of renal renin for the homeostasis of the blood pressure was shown by the decrease in pressure which followed blockade of the renin system. Contrary to Saralasin which did not change the blood pressure in nephrectomized mice, injections of SQ 20.881 did in some mice result in a decrease in blood pressure, which was probably caused by its ability to inhibit bradykininases. Both Saralasin and SQ 20.881 elicited marked increases in plasma renin in normal, but not in nephrectomized mice, showing that, while renal renin release is controlled by the plasma angiotensin II concentration, this does not apply to submaxillary renin release.", 
    "224": "(Des-Asp1)-angiotensin I, angiotensin II and III were evaluated for pressor activities in conscious nephrectomized rats and for steroidogenic actions in rat adrenal zona glomerulosa. The pressor effect of this angiotensin nonapeptide was similar to that found with mole-equivalent doses of angiotensin III (one-third as active as angiotensin II) and was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the 0. jararaca nonapeptide converting enzyme inhibitor. Hence, (des-Asp1)-angiotensin I is a substrate for converting enzyme in vivo, and the rapid conversion indicates that an alternate pathway for the formation of angiotensin III could exist. (Des-Asp1)-angiotensin I possessed only 0.1% of the activity of angiotensin III as a steroidogenic agent in cell suspensions of rat adrenal zona glomerulosa. Angiotensin I was a weak steroidogenic agent in vitro (1%) and was not blocked by an inhibitor of converting enzyme. Adrenal cells dispersed from the outer zone of the cortex would appear to be devoid of significant converting enzyme activity.", 
    "225": "On the rabbit isolated aorta, dose-dependent contractions to both angiotensin II and heptapeptide ([des-Asp1]-angiotensin II) were obtained. The curves were parallel, and reached the same maximum level. On the rat isolated uterus, angiotensin II and the heptapeptide displayed non-parallel dose-response curves. Results obtained with angiotensin-analog antagonists and cross-tachyphylaxis experiments suggest that the heptapeptide and angiotensin II act, preferentially, on different populations of receptors in the uterus. The difference in action of indomethacin on recovery from tachyphylaxis to angiotensin II and heptapeptide on rat isolated aorta suggests that the mechanism of induction of tachyphylaxis by these two peptides may differ. SQ 20881, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, totally inhibited uterine responses to both decapeptide and nonapeptide, while slightly potentiating those to angiotensin II and heptapaptide. Indomethacin had no significant effect on uterine responses to either angiotensin II or the heptapeptide.", 
    "226": "The angiotensin I-coverting enzyme (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) was isolated from both guinea pig lung and serum; Km and V values were determined using both angiotensin I and hippurylhistidylleucine as substrates. Km values for the lung enzyme were 3.1 mM for hippurylhistidylleucine hippurylhistidylleucine and 0.076 mM for angiotensin I. Inhibition studies were performed and I50 values were obtained with the following inhibitors: angiotensin II (lung, 1.9 - 10(-5) M; serum, 1.7 - 10(-5) M), bradykinin (lung, 2.6 - 10(-6) M; serum, 2.1 - 10(-6) M), and pyrrolidone-Lys-Trp-Ala-Pro (lung, 7.9 - 10(-8) M; serum, 5.6 - 10(-8) M). Both enzymes were glycoproteins and were inhibited by concanavalin A. A maximum inhibition of 35% initial enzymatic activity was observed for both enzymes at a concanavalin A concentration of 4 - 10(-4) M suggesting that the sugar moieties of each enzyme are similar. Both enzymes required NaCl for activity and were inhibited by EDTA. A comparison of kinetic and inhibition properties indicates that both enzymes are quite similar.", 
    "227": "Bradykinin is very efficiently inactivated on passage through the pulmonary circulation by enzymes on the vascular walls. Several different cleavages of the bradykinin molecule have been observed; one appears to be due to angiotensin converting enzyme. Several types of inhibitors have been useful in the study of these pulmonary peptidases and have helped increase understanding of the functioning of the angiotensin and plasma kinin systems.", 
    "228": "Rabbit isolated left atria have been used to study the inotropic action of angiotensin II (ATII). The peptide is active at doses ranging from 1.0 x 10(-9) to 2.8 x 10(-6)M and its inotropic effect is not modified by sotalol, phentolamine, burimamide, and indomethacin. We therefore propose that this effect results from the stimulation of receptors specific for ATII. Dose-response curves of ATII obtained in presence of increasing concentrations of 8-Gly-ATII are gradually displaced to the right, but high doses of the antagonist depressed the maximum contractions caused by ATII. pA2 value for 8-Gly-ATII in this preparation is similar to those observed in vascular and intestinal smooth muscles. Order of potency of analogues of ATII (2-, 3- and 5-Ala-ATII), acting as full agonists, but with reduced affinity, is similar to that found in rabbit aorta strips. It is therefore proposed that receptors for ATII in rabbit isolated left atria are pharmacologically similar to those present in vascular smooth muscles. Positive inotropic effects of angiotensin I, undecapeptide (1-11), dodecapeptide (1-12) and tetradecapeptide (1-14) renin substrate are antagonized by 8-Gly-ATII in similar way as the effect of ATII. This suggests that the action of these peptides is mainly due to stimulation of receptors for ATII. The contribution of myocardial converting enzyme to the action of these peptides is discussed.", 
    "229": "The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the development of congestive failure has been assessed in the conscious dog by use of the nonapeptide converting enzyme inhibitor. Constriction of the pulmonary artery or thoracic inferior vena cava was maintained for 2 wk while daily measurements were made of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, plasma volume, hematocrit, serum sodium and potassium concentrations, sodium and water balance, body weight, and arterial, caval, and atrial pressures. The initial response to constriction was a reduction in blood pressure, a rise in plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and water intake, and nearly complete sodium retention. In the days after moderate constriction plasma volume and body weight increased (with development of ascites and edema); blood pressure, sodium excretion, plasma renin acvitity, and plasma aldosterone returned to normal. In animals in which blood pressure was not restored, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone remained elevated throughout the period of constriction. Single injections of converting enzyme inhibitor reduced blood pressure when plasma renin activity was elevated. Chronic infusion of the inhibitor in dogs with thoracic inferior vena caval constriction prevented the restoration of blood pressure and suppressed the rise in plasma aldosterone; sodium retention and volume expansion were less than in control experiments. Thus the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an essential role in the maintenance of blood pressure during the genesis of congestive failure. Initially, the restoration of blood pressure is dependent upon circulating angiotensin II; in the later stages, blood pressure is dependent upon the increase in plasma volume.", 
    "230": "Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by the generalized formation of granulomas and is accompanied by elevation in the serum in less than half the patients of angiotensin converting enzyme, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the pressor octapeptide, angiotensin II, and L-histidyl-L-leucine. Mean activity of angiotensin converting enzyme was elevated generally more than 10-fold in granuloma-containing lymph nodes, but not in lung in which normally it is abundant, in 19 of 20 patients with sarcoidosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme in lymph nodes from subjects with sarcoidosis was similar to the enzyme from normal lung and lymph node with respect to activity as a function of pH, inhibition of activity by EDTA and o-phenanthroline, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, and requirement for chloride for activity, but appeared to be more heat labile. The data suggest that the granulomas in sarcoidosis may be the source of the elevated serum enzyme and that cells of the granulomas, particularly the epitheloid cells which appear by electron microscopy to have active protein biosynthesis, may be actively synthesizing the enzyme.", 
    "231": "The angiotensin I converting enzyme has two important functions: it inactivates bradykinin and converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of the enzyme blocks the renin-angiotensin system and decreases systemic blood pressure if the pressure is maintained or increased by renin. The enzyme occurs in a variety of tissues and cell forms. The vascular endothelial cells of the lung and of peripheral blood vessels, and the epithelial cells of the kidney tubules are major sources of the enzyme. In addition to inactivating hypotensive peptides and activating a hypertensive one in the systemic circulation, the enzyme may affect organ functions by hydrolyzing peptides that are formed and released locally.", 
    "232": "The drinking response produced by direct injection of angiotensin I and II into the brain of the rat, was studied, using the angiotensin blocking agents SQ-20,881 (SQ) and P-113 (Saralasin). SQ inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, preventing formation of angiotensin II, while P-113 is an analogue and competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II. SQ blocked central angiotensin I drinking, but only when the enzyme inhibitor was injected into the ventricle. Angiotensin II induced thirst was not blocked by SQ. P-113 inhibited angiotensin I and II drinking responses in both the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and the lateral ventricle. These data indicate that conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is important in angiotensin-induced drinking, although an independent action of angiotensin I on drinking can not be ruled out at this time.", 
    "233": "1. A colorimetric method was developed for the direct chemical assay of human carboxypeptidase A (carboxypolypeptidase; EC 3.4.12.2) with angiotensin converting enzyme-like activity in serum or plasma, with the substrate analogue glycyl-L-histidylglycine and the angiotensin converting enzyme substrate angiotensin I (A-I). This method was based on the spectrophototometric determination of histidylglycine and histidyl-leucine, products of the hydrolysis of glycyl-L-histidylglycine and A-I respectively. omicron-Phthalaldehyde reacted with the imidazole moiety of nu-terminal histidyl peptides to produce a yellow chromophore. 2. A large number of inhibitors were tested for their effects on carboxypolpeptidase activity. The hydrolysis of Gly-His-Gly and A-I was inhibited by histidyl-leucine and angiotensin II, both products of the hydrolysis of A-I. Bothrops jararaca venom extract, EDTA, rho-chloromercuribenzoate, 8-hydroxyquinoline and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, previously reported as converting enzyme inhibitors, also inhibited carboxypolypeptidase activity. 3. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity in the serum of sixty-six adults ranged from 10 to 37 nmol of glycyl-L-histidylglygine hydrolysed in 10 min by 10 mu1 of serum at 37 degrees C and pH 7-25.", 
    "234": "Angiotensin III is formed from des-Asp1 -angiotensin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme. The Km (11 muM) of the reaction is one-third of that for the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II. As suggested by the Km values, bradykinin, peptide BPP9a and angiotensins II and III are better inhibitors of the formation of angiotensin II than of the formation of angiotensin III.", 
    "235": "The effects of Asp1-beta-amide-Val5-angiotensin II (A II) and Asp1-Ile5-angiotensin I (A I) have been studied on the isolated continuously superfused cat tracheal muscle contracted by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Both peptides have been shown to induce dose-dependent relaxation on this muscle. Similar effects have been obtained with synthetic bradykinin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), noradrenaline and histamine. The effects of bradykinin, A I and A II have been shown to be inhibited by aspirin but not by propranolol, metiamide, SC 19220 or a specific, competitive antagonist of A II. The relaxing effect of A I is not due to the conversion of decapeptide to octapeptide A II. The possible mechanism of the relaxing effects of A I and A II on the cat isolated tracheal muscle is discussed.",

The enzyme isolated converts angiotensine I into angiotensine II and distroys bradikinin. It is active in neutral medium, is activated by chloride ion and is inhibited by EDTA and Middle Asian snakes venom. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 180 000-190 000 as estimated by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, its isoelectric point is 4.48-4.53. The comparison of properties and specificity of carboxycathepsin from bovine lung and kidney draws to the conclusion that both enzymes are identical.", 
    "237": "To examine the role of angiotensin II in the maintenance of blood pressure and the control of aldosterone secretion in man, eight normal subjects were studied on a tilt table in sodium replete and sodium depleted states prior to and subsequent to the intravenous infusion of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI). In both the sodium replete or sodium depleted state, upright tilting resulted in an increase in heart rate and a narrowing of pulse pressure. None of the sodium replete or depleted subjects fainted. Tilting was accompanied by a rise in plasma renin activity with an associated rise in plasma aldosterone concentration. When converting enzyme inhibitor was administered, which blocked the generation of angiotensin II, sodium replete subjects were able to compensate for an upright tilt, despite the absence of angiotensin II, without significant hemodynamic change when compared to control state. In sodium depleted subjects, after the administration of converting enzyme inhibitor, there was a sharp and significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure associated with a significant rise in heart rate. All but one sodium depleted subject fainted within seven minutes. Both plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity rose on tilting in both sodium replete and sodium depleted subjects. After the administration of converting enzyme inhibitor, plasma aldosterone failed to rise in association with a rise in plasma renin activity. In supine subjects, after the administration of converting enzyme inhibitor, plasma renin activity rose but plasma aldosterone concentration fell. In sodium depleted subjects, after the administration of CEI, aldosterone fell to a level significantly lower than that in supine controls and to a level no different from the supine sodium replete subject. These results indicate that angiotensin II is essential for blood pressure maintenance in sodium depleted individuals, that angiotensin II exerts a direct feedback control on renin secretion, and that angiotensin II is the primary stimulus to aldosterone secretion in response to both sodium depletion and to posture.", 
    "238": "Increasing concentrations of angiotensin I and different perfusion rates were used to study the conversion of angiotensin I in guinea-pig and rat lungs. Even the highest concentration used (32.0 muM), which is a thousand times higher than that which occurs in vivo, was unable to saturate the converting system indicating the enormous capacity of this system. SQ 20881 proved to be a reversible inhibitor of the converting system. Its effect on the angiotensin I conversion was greater in guinea-pig lungs than in rat lungs (ID50 was 40.0 nM in guinea-pig lung and above 360.0 nM in rat lungs at a substrate concentration of 38.6 nM).", 
    "239": "1. Water and saline intake was measured in rats depleted of Na by I.P. dialysis. Na intake was prevented 180 min but not 60-90 min after bilateral nephrectomy. Unilateral nephrectomy as well as ureteral ligature had no effect on Na intake. 2. Renin (3u.) injected I.P. re-established the Na appetite abolished by nephrectomy. 3. Angiotensin I (5 ng) or II (5-40 ng) injected into the 3rd ventricle, also restored the Na intake and this effect was dose-dependent. 4. The angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor Sq 20,881 (1 mg/kg) inhibited the effect of AI but not that of AII in restoring Na intake. 5. It is concluded that the kidneys might play a role in the regulation of Na intake through the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "240": "Kinins and prostaglandins of the E series (PGE) have the capacity to influence renal hemodynamic and excretory events and may interact intrarenally so as to reinforce one another. Thus, in the isolated Krebs-perfused rabbit kidney we showed that addition of either bradykinin or kininogen to the perfusing fluid augments the release of a PGE-like substance and that aprotinin, a kallikrein inhibitor, reduces the release of prostaglandins evoked by kininogen but not by bradykinin. Moreover, we have observed that deoxycorticosterone, an agent which increases urinary kallikrein, enhances the urinary excretion of PGE-like substance, and that this effect is prevented by simultaneous treatment with aprotinin. These observations and our demonstration that enhanced intrarenal activity of the kallikrein-kinin system, consequent to kininase II inhibition, is associated with renal vasodilation, diuresis, and natriuresis, suggest that a coupling of kinins and prostaglandins intrarenally may be directed towards the facilitation of salt-water excretion. The interdigitation of prostaglandins and the kallikrein-kinin system may thereby constitute the essential operation of a regulatory system in which the complementary actions of these hormones antagonize the sodium retaining effect of mineralocorticoids in those states in which salt-water balance is positive.", 
    "241": "Two-kidney renal hypertension in the rat (left renal artery narrowing) was shown to be dependent on the vasoconstrictor action of renin-angiotensin throughout its time course as evidenced by the simultaneous: 1) rise in blood pressure; 2) elevation in plasma renin activity; and 3) vasodepressor sensitivity to the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ-20881. One-kidney renal hypertension (left renal artery narrowing plus contralateral nephrectomy), in contrast, was shown to be independent of the vasoconstrictor action of renin-angiotensin. The role played by the sympathetic nervous system in one-kidney renal hypertension was studied in animals in which the peripheral sympathetic nervous system was completely ablated by chronic guanethidine treatment and adrenal demedullation. The completeness of the sympathectomy was pharmacologically confirmed by 1) marked reduction of tyramine vasoconstriction; 2) lack of sensitivity to ganglionic blockade (pentolinium); and 3) complete reversal of blood pressure responsiveness to phentolamine. When such animals were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy and left renal artery constriction, they still developed a significant hypertension compared to their unclipped controls and the hypertension remained renin independent. One-kidney renal artery-clipped animals that were only neonatally guanethidine-treated or were only adrenal-demedullated, also developed low-renin renal hypertension. It can be concluded that one-kidney renal hypertension is not only low-renin hypertension but that it can develop in the complete absence of adrenal medullary and peripheral adrenergic function.", 
    "242": "Angiotensin I (A-I) and angiotensin II (A-II) produced dose-dependent increases in isometric tension in isolated strips of uterine smooth muscle prepared from ovariectomized golden hamsters treated with estrogen. Responses to A-II were consistent with receptor--occupancy theory of agonist--receptor interactions. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme virtually abolished responses to A-I but not those to A-II. Blockade of A-II receptors inhibited responses to both A-I and A-II. Cholinergic or alpha-adrenergic blockade did not alter uterine responses to either A-I or A-II. These findings suggest that contractile responses elicited in the isolated uterus of the hamster are due to its local conversion to A-II and subsequent interactions with specific A-II receptors. Such conversion occurs at least to the extent of 14 to 27 %.", 
    "243": "Two of the agents known to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, namely Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II and the nonapeptide SQ 20881, have been used to clarify the role of angiotensin II (AII) and its cogeners upon the steroidogenesis in isolated fasciculata cells from bovine adrenal tissue. It could be concluded that: (1) des-Asp1-angiotensin II is as active as AII on steroidogenesis from bovine fasciculata cells; (2) angiotensin I, although less potent, stimulates steroid production without being converted to AII or des-Asp1-AII, and (3) Sar1-Ala8-AII inhibits all three peptides in a competitive manner. The presence of a common receptor for all these three peptides is suggested.", 
    "244": "1. Isolated rat kidneys were perfused at a constant pressure of 90 mmHg in a single-pass system with either a cell-free medium or a suspension of washed bovine red blood cells, free of the components of the renin-angiotensin system. In red blood cell perfused kidneys renal haemodynamics and sodium reabsorption corresponded closer to values observed in the intact rat than in cell-free perfused kidneys. 2. In red blood cell-perfused kidneys in the absence of plasma renin substrate autoregulation of renal blood flow was almost complete at pressures above 90 mmHg, provided that perfusion pressure was changed rapidly. 3. Renin release varied inversely with perfusion pressure within a pressure range from 50 to 150 mmHg; the greatest changes of renin release occurred, when perfusion pressure was reduced from 90 to 70 mmHg; maximal stimulation of renin release was observed at 50 mmHg. After reduction of perfusion pressure, renin release immediately started to rise and reached a new level within 5 min. Local reduction of perfusion pressure in small arteries and arterioles by the injection of microspheres induced a short-lasting decrease in renal plasma flow and a transient stimulation of renin release. 4. High concentrations of furosemide stimulated renin release by a direct intrarenal mechanism. 5. Isoproterenol stimulated renin release in low concentrations without a concomitant vasodilation, whereas high concentrations induced an increase in both renal plasma flow and renin release. The effects of isoproterenol were completely blocked by propranolol. 6. Sodium nitroprusside induced similar increases in renal plasma flow, as did high concentrations of isoproterenol, but only a small and slow increase in renin release was observed. 7. Angiotensin II (AII) suppressed renin release in concentrations corresponding to plasma levels measured in the intact rat independently of its vasoconstrictor effects, whereas vasopressin in antidiuretic concentrations did not affect renin release. 8. AII, AI, synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate (TDP), crude and purified rat plasma renin substrate induced a dose-dependent reduction in renal plasma flow. SQ 20 881, a competitive inhibitor of converting enzyme, and low doses of 1-Sar-8-Ala-AII (saralasin), a competitive antagonist of AII, did not change renal plasma flow, whereas high concentrations of saralasin had a vasoconstrictor effect on their own. 9. Saralasin inhibited the vasoconstrictor effects of AII and TDP to a similar degree. SQ 20 881 inhibited the vasoconstrictor effects of AI and purified renin substrate, but did not influence the actions of TDP and the crude renin substrate preparation. 10. From these data it is concluded, that AI is converted into AII within the kidney at a rate of 1-2%. The vasoconstriction induced by the crude renin substrate probably does not involve the AII receptors. TDP may act by itself on the AII receptors or via the direct intrarenal formation of AII...", 
    "245": "Carboxycathepsin from bovine kidney split the dipeptide fragments from the C-terminal part of peptides of different structure. Peptides containing the proline residue at the second position from the C-terminal amino acid residue and also peptides with substituted terminal alpha-carboxyl group were not hydrolyzed by carboxycathepsin. The enzyme was activated by Cl, Zn2+, Co2+ and Mn2+. The substances which formed the chelate complexes with ions of two-valent metals and also heavy metal ions, inhibited the enzymatic activity. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate did not inhibit carboxycathepsin. The homogeneous preparation of carboxycathepsin converted angiotensin 1 into angiotensin 11 and hydrolyzed bradikinine, splitting off C-terminal dipeptides consequentially.", 
    "246": "The effect of angiotensin I on renal perfusion pressure, and on basal and isoprenaline stimulated renin secretion, was examined in the isolated perfused rat kidney. The increase in prefusion pressure associated with intrarenal infusion of angiotensin I suggested conversion of the peptide to angiotensin II within the kidney. Basal renin secretion and the stimulatory response to isoprenaline were significantly suppressed by angiotensin I. The converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20,881, infused at 1,600 X dose of angiotensin I, partially reversed the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin I without altering the degree of suppression of renin secretion.", 
    "247": "Stimulation of the renal nerves can cause cortical vasoconstriction either by direct activation of vascular smooth muscle or by the generation of angiotensin II following renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells. High doses ( greater than 5 mug/min) of the renal neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) infused into the renal artery of the baboon causes cortical vasoconstriction. This NA-induced vasoconstriction is significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) by SQ20881, an inhibitor of converting enzyme, and by saralasin, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II. These results suggest that NA stimulates the renin-angiotensin mechanism. The further addition of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, to the NA-SQ20881 or NA-saralasin infusate completely abolishes NA-induced cortical vasoconstriction. These results suggest that NA-induced cortical vasoconstriction in the kidney is mediated by activation of both the renin-angiotensin system and alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "248": "The importance of the renin-angiotensin-vasoconstrictor system during haemorrhagic hypotension was quantitated in 44 areflexic dogs by determining the ability of the arterial pressure to recover following haemorrhage to 8.8 kPa (66 mm Hg). In 30 animals with intact kidneys, the arterial pressure following haemorrhage rose to a new steady-state level averaging 11.7 kPa (88 mm Hg), which represented 65.3 +/- 1.8 (SE) % compensation. In 18 nephrectomized animals only 24.4 +/- 1.5% compensation occurred. The system exhibited a relatively rapid time course for pressure compensation with the new steady state occurring 19.2 +/- 2.0 min after haemorrhage. Following reinfusion of blood the pressure returned to the pre-haemorrhage in 19.2 +/- 3.0 min. Arterial renin activity was significantly elevated following haemorrhage in the intact kidney group and unchanged in the anephric group. The arterial pressure compensation of two animals with intact kidneys was significantly reduced when the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20881) was infused before the haemorrhage. The results are consistent with a renin-angiotensin-vasoconstrictor mechanism of arterial pressure compensation and indicate that this mechanism possesses sufficient gain and time response characteristics to play a homeostatically significatn role during haemorrhagic hypotension.", 
    "249": "In pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, close arterial injections of bradykinin and kallidin elicit a dose related increase in femoral blood flow. Treatment with the kininase inhibitor BPP9alpha augments the femoral blood flow responses to bradykinin and kallidin by five and threefold respectively. The sensitivity of the preparation permits the detection of 0.5-1 ng of either bradykinin or kallidin in untreated dogs and as little as 0.1 ng of kinin peptides in animals receiving BPP9alpha. This sensitivity and the steepness of the dose response curves make this procedure suitable for the assay of kinins.", 
    "250": "Renal hypertension was produced in 14 Sprague-Dawley rats by ligating both poles of one kidney followed in one week by unilateral nephrectomy. Biweekly subcutaneous injections of SQ 20858 reduced the blood pressure in the chronic renal hypertensive animals. Upon discontinuing the injections the blood pressure rose to pretreatment levels. No angiotensin II activity was seen in seven of the renal group treated with SQ indicating a complete block in serum converting enzyme activity. Likewise, serum with only angiotensin I activity when added to normal serum containing converting enzyme, continued to show angiotensin I activity. It is concluded that SQ 20858 is effective in lowering blood pressure in chronic renal hypertensive rats presumably by partially inhibiting converting enzyme.", 
    "251": "Ingibition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme with SQ 20,881 results in a rapid marked increase in plasma renin concentration in mice. The maximum effect is short-lasting, but the values are still elevated 2 hours after the injection, the time course being similar to that previously found in rats. The relative increase is the same in normal and sialo-adenectomized mice. The plasma renin concentration of nephrectomized mice with their submaxillary glands intact is, however, totally uninfluenced by injection of the blocker. This finding indicates that renin release from the submaxillary glands is not controlled by the plasma angiotensin II concentration as is that of the renin release from the kidneys.", 
    "252": "Inhibition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme with SQ 20.881 results in a 2 to 35 fold increase in plasma renin concentration in normal rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effect is transient, lasting for 1 to 3 hours even in the presence of prolonged blockade. The relative increase is independent of the pretreatment plasma renin concentration. The blood pressure is unchanged in conscious rats in which the effect of SQ 20.881 on plasma renin is believed to be due to a blockade of the negative feedback of angiotensin II on renin release. In anaesthetized rats, SQ 20.88) has an additional hypotensive effect which augments the increase in plasma renin. Saralasin is without effect on blood pressure and plasma renin in conscious normal rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats, while it causes a transient 3 to 27 fold increase in plasma renin concentration in anaesthetized rats. It is suggested that this increase is hardly due to an interception of the feedback, but to the concomitant fall in blood pressure, as a similar hypotension and increase in plasma renin is produced by dihydralazine. It is furthermore found that Saralasin blocks renin release induced by SQ 20.881. This demonstrates that Saralasin is bound to the receptors in the juxtaglomerular cells and has slight, agonistic properties there. Both in conscious rats and in anaesthetized adrenalectomized rats substituted with DOCA and salt, SQ 20.881 as well Saralasin causes transient increases in plasma renin concentration. If such rats are only substituted with salt and not with DOCA, the effects of both blockers are in the form of severe hypotension and a permanent elevation of plasma renin.", 
    "253": "The level of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was elevated in 15 of 17 patients with active sarcoidosis. Serum ACE was studied to determine the effect of chronic lung disease upon the blood level of an enzyme believed to originate from the lungs. The assay was performed in approximately 200 control subjects and 200 patients with chronic lung disease using hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine as substrate. Enzyme activity greater in male control subjects than in female subjects of comparable age and greater in children than in adults. Serum ACE was significantly reduced in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis, as compared to control subjects, and was even lower in those receiving corticosteroids. Of greatest interest, however, was that levels in patients with active sarcoidosis not receiving steroids were greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean for the adult control subjects (greater than 11.6 units) whereas levels in patients with sarcoidosis receiving steroids and in those with resolved disease were normal. A survey of subjects with other granulomatous diseases failed to reveal any other condition that was significantly associated with a similar elevation of serum ACE levels. Elevation of ACE levels in sarcoidosis appears to be associated with the active disease process and does not appear to be a familial inherited enzyme abnormality. An assay of serum ACE is a useful tool for regulating therapy in sarcoidosis and for confirming the diagnosis, since it readily distinguishes these patients from others with tuberculosis, lung cancer or lymphoma.", 
    "254": "Salt deprivation has been shown to cause fluid volume contraction and marked renin release; it is not clear whether angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction adds to low volume in compromising circulatory function or whether there are additional facets to the salt-deprived state. Mature Wistar rats were fed a low-salt diet for 1 mo and then, under pentobarbital anesthesia, compared to normals. Arterial pressure (is congruent to 125 mmHg), cardiac output (is congruent to 200 ml/min per kg), and total peripheral resistance were nearly identical in both groups. The influence of angiotensin was estimated by injecting converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20881, 1 mg/kg), and then observing the immediate hemodynamic response. Salt-deprived rats responded with a large (-47 mmHg) fall in pressure and total peripheral resistance indicating that, although total peripheral resistance was normal in salt deprivation, an increased fraction (30% vs. 11%) of the resistance was supported by angiotensin. Cardiac output decreased (-8%) in contrast to the increase that would be expected during marked arterial dilation; elevated angiotensin levels may have caused a moderate, beneficial decrease in venous compliance. These results suggest that circulatory function is adequately maintained during salt deprivation by a combination of normal total peripheral resistance and decreased venous compliance.", 
    "255": "Two new analogs of bradykinin, [8-beta-homophenylalanine]- and [7-beta-homoproline]bradykinin, have been synthesized by the solid-phase technique. In the anesthetized rat, [7-beta-HPro]bradykinin was equipotent with bradykinin and 30-100 times more potent than [8-beta-HPhe]bradykinin in vasodepressor activity. Both analogs were resistant to degradation in vitro by dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase from rabbit lung. Only the 7-beta-HPro analog seemed to be resistant to this type of degradation in vivo, since its hypotensive effect in the anesthetized rat was not potentiated by SQ 20881 (BPP9a), an inhibitor of dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase.", 
    "256": "After subcutaneous isotransplantation of renal medulla either from normal donors or from the ischaemic kidney of renal two-kidney hypertensive rats, the blood pressure of the renal two-kidney hypertensive recipients was lowered-but not to normal levels. After i.v. injection of the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20,881, the blood pressure was further decreased to, or close to, normal blood pressure. A complete normalization of the blood pressure was obtained by the combined treatment with medullary transplants and infusions of the angiotensin II inhibitor Saralasin. The difference between the effects of these two blockers was probably caused by differences in the doses used. Administration of indomethacin, an inhibitor of the prostaglandin biosynthesis, to renal two-kidney hypertensive rats with or without renomedullary transplants failed to provoke a rise in blood pressure. This indicates that the anti-hypertensive activity of renomedullary transplants is not due to the group of prostaglandins, the synthesis of which is inhibited by indomethacin, and furthermore that these prostaglandins are not of importance to the blood pressure level in renal two-kidney hypertensive rats.", 
    "257": "In chloralose-anesthetized dogs, we investigated the disappearance of bradykinin on passage across the renal circulation. The peptide was infused into a renal artery at various doses (5-200 ng/kg min-1); renal blood flow and the concentration of kinins in renal venous blood were then determined and the percent survival of bradykinin on passage through the kidney calculated. Bradykinin caused a dose-related increase in renal blood flow, urine flow, sodium excretion, and kinin content of renal venous blood. Intravenous administration of BPP9alpha (300 mug/kg), a peptide kininase II inhibitor, potentiated the renal vasodilator, diuretic, and natriuretic actions of bradykinin and augmented the survival of the kinin on passage through the kidney from 12.72 +/- 1.64% in control dogs to 53.92 +/- 7.48% (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, the values of peptide survival were positively correlated with the increases in renal blood flow (r = 0.92, P less than 0.01), urine flow (r = 0.75, P less than 0.01), and sodium excretion (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01) produced by bradykinin. In addition, BPP9alpha by itself increased renal blood flow (16%, P less than 0.01), urine flow (115%, P less than 0.005), and sodium excretion (167%, P less than 0.02). Similarly, the concentration of kinin in renal venous blood and the excretion of urinary kinins rose from 0.11 +/- 0.03 ng/ml and 4.1 +/- 1.1 ng/min to 0.24 +/- 0.05 ng/ml (P less than 0.005) and 38.5 +/- 12.2 ng/min (P less than 0.02). These studies suggest that kinins generated intrarenally play a role in the regulation of renal blood flow and salt-water excretion and that variations in the capacity of the kidney to inactivate kinins may be a determinant of the intrarenal activity of the kallikrein-kinin system.", 
    "258": "To test the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the development of the pulmonary vascular patholigic changes of chronic alveolar hypoxia, two groups of rats were exposed to 0.5 atm. for 21 days. One group received SQ 20,881 (2 mg. per kg.) every 8 hours subcutaneously and the second group received normal saline. A third group of rats was maintained at normobaria. Rats receiving SQ 20,881 had significantly less pulmonary arterial hypertrophy and right ventricular hypertrophy than hypobaric animals. SQ 20,881-treated rats showed a significant increase in adrenal weight but a marked reduction in the thickness of the zona glomerulosa, as compared with the other groups. Our findings indicate that angiotensin II is necessary in the development of the pulmonary vascular structural changes of chronic alveolar hypoxia.", 
    "259": "The sympathetic nervous system has been postulated to play a role in the maintenance of renal hypertension. Permanent peripheral sympathectomy was performed by treating newborn rats for 21 days with guanethidine. Sympathectomy was confirmed by (1) relative insensitivity to tyramine, (2) lack of responsiveness to renal nerve stimulation, and (3) absence of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunofluorescence in renal blood vessels. Placement of a clip on the left renal artery led to the development of two-kidney renal hypertension. No differences were observed between the two-kidney renal hypertensive normal and sympathectomized rats; both had elevated plasma renin activity and vasodepression with angiotensin antagonists which were maintained up to nine weeks. Furthermore, in normal rats chronic beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol caused no change in the development of the two-kidney renal hypertension. Similarly, no differences were seen in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, or response to antagonists between the one-kidney renal hypertensive (clip plus contralateral nephrectomy) normal and sympathectomized rats. Both showed sustained low renin hypertension up to 12 weeks. The absence of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system did not affect the development or maintenance of hypertension in either model of hypertension.", 
    "260": "1. The results of the administration of the nona-peptide inhibitor (SQ 20,881) of the enzymatic conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II in twelve severe hypertensive patients are presented. 2. Administration of the compound was associated with a fall in blood pressure in ten of twelve patients. 3. Four patients had a normal plasma renin activity (PRA) with a range of 1.6-3.7 ng h-1 ml-1 and eight patients had a high PRA with a range of 5.0-74 ng h-1 ml-1. Two of the patients with normal PRA had no fall in blood pressure despite receiving 2 mg/kg of the compound. Two patients with normal PRA, however, did respond, thus indicating that a high PRA is not necessary for a response to the inhibitor compound. 4. It was found that haemodialysis or diuresis with frusemide enhanced the blood pressure response to the compound. 5. The presence of a measured low total blood volume was found to be associated with an exaggerated fall in blood pressure to a small dose of compound (0.125 mg/kg) in one patient.", 
    "261": "1. The anti-hypertensive effect of converting enzyme inhibition was evaluated in twenty-three hypertensive patients (seven renovascular, four essential, four malignant, one scleroderma, three chronic renal failure, four primary or idiopathic aldosteronism). 2. In sixteen patients a single injection (1--4 mg/kg) of the inhibitor produced an immediate anti-hypertensive effect, which lasted up to 16 h. In six patients the anti-hypertensive effect of the inhibitor was significantly improved after sodium depletion. 3. Plasma renin activities increased and plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased consistently except in idiopathic aldosteronism. 4. Converting enzyme inhibition provides a direct way of defining the degree of renin-dependency of the hypertension. Accordingly, it can be used diagnostically and for planning appropriate therapy. Therapeutically, it could be advantageous in hypertensive emergencies because of its safety, specificity and capacity to reduce aldosterone secretion.", 
    "262": "In isolated perfused rabbit hearts, bradykinin produced a concentration-dependent decrease in coronary resistance directly associated with biosynthesis and release of prostaglandin-E-like substance. An inhibitor of bradykinin destruction (the nonapeptide SQ-20881) markedly enhanced both the coronary vasodilation and release of prostaglandin-E-like substance produced by cardiac injection of bradykinin. Indomethacin inhibited both the myocardial prostaglandin biosynthesis and the decrease in coronary resistance induced by bradykinin. The demonstration that bradykinin is a potent stimulator of prostaglandin biosynthesis in the heart has implications as to the cause of the afferent cardiovascular reflexes and pain in myocardial infarction and angina pectoris.", 
    "263": "An investigation of the relationship between nephrotensin and the renin angiotensin system was carred out. Nephrotensin was found in the plasma of rats with renal clip hypertension and with chemically induced kidney damage. There was no demonstrable correlation between presence of nephrotensin and plasma renin activity, and the pressor activity of nephrotensin was not altered by previous immunization of test animals with angiotensin II nor by pretreatment with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor. These results indicate that nephrotensin is different from the components of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "264": "Experiments were performed in dogs to determine the effects of the intravenous administration of the dipeptide hydrolase inhibitor SQ 20,881 on renal hemodynamics, intrarenal blood flow distribution, and renal function. Dipeptide hydrolase converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinin. SQ 20,881 causes an inhibition of the vasoconstrictor response after angiotensin I and potentiation of the vasodilatory activity of bradykinin. Total renal blood flow, cortical distribution of blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate were determined. In seven animals administration of SQ 20,881 (1 mg/kg) resulted in a decrease in mean systemic blood pressure of 11 mmHg, an increase in total renal blood flow of 0.71 ml/min per g, and a significant fall in glomerular filtration rate. Fractional blood flow to the superficial cortex decreased and to the juxtamedullary cortex increased. Absolute flow was unchanged in the superficial cortex and increased significantly in the deep cortex. The findings are compatible with reported effects of bradykinin on intrarenal blood flow distribution, although the experiments do not distinguish between potentiation of bradykinin or inhibition of angiotensin I conversion.", 
    "265": "Renal artery constriction in the unilaterally nephrectomized, trained dog, with maintained renal arterial hypotension, produces a prompt increase in systemic renin activity and blood pressure. The hypertension normally induced by renal artery stenosis is prevented by prior treatment with the nonapeptide Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro (SQ 20, 881), which blocks conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Constant intravenous infusion of the inhibitor over several days of renal artery constriction prevents the development of chronic renovascular hypertension. Furthermore, a single injection of the nonapeptide restores blood pressure to normal in the early phase of renovascular hypertension, but becomes progressively less effective as salt and water retention occurs in the chronic stage when plasma renin activity returns to control levels. These data provide strong evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is responsible for the initiation of renovascular hypertension in the one-kidney Goldblatt dog, but that other factors become increasingly important in chronic renovascular hypertension.", 
    "266": "Renin, iso-renin, angiotensin I. angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensinases were measured in plasma and in various extrarenal tissues of rats. Despite complete suppression of plasma renin in rats bearing pituitary tumors iso-renin and all other components of the renin-angiotensin system were found to be at or above control concentrations. The results strongly suggest that there is local synthesis of iso-renin in extrarenal tissues.", 
    "267": "In the membrane fraction of rat uterus, kinin-destroying activity was found and characterized as kininase II by means of several kininase inhibitors. It could be shown that sudies of bradykinin-receptor interactions requires the use of kininase inhibitors like phenanthroline or the use of a stable bradykinin analogue like [8-erythro-alpha-amino-beta-phenylbutyric acid]-bradykinin.", 
    "268": "Based on fluorometric determination of a dipeptide histidil-leucine, which is splitted off from a synthetic substrate (Cbz-Phe-His-Leu) by carboxycathepsin (carboxydipeptidyl peptide hydrolase), a method was developed for estimation of the enzymatic activity in human blood serum. The method is characterized by simplicity and high sensitivity; Use of small amount of blood serum (about 0.03 ml) was possible. In normal human blood serum the carboxycathepsin activity varied from 7.5 to 18 nmoles of the dipeptide, liberated per mg of protein per hr.", 
    "269": "1 Intravenous infusion of 0.072 mumol kg(-1) h(-1) (1Asp, 5-Ile) angiotensin I, 0.116 mumol kg(-1) h(-1) of (1-Asp beta-amid, 5-Val) angiotensin II or of (1-Asp, 5-Ile) angiotensin II, caused food-deprived and water-satiated rats to drink about 3.0 ml of water per animal. This indicates that angiotensin I has a 1.6 times stronger dipsogenic effect than the angiotensin II preparations when infused intravenously.2 The converting-enzyme-inhibitor SQ 20881 (Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) had no intrinsic dipsogenic effect.3 SQ 20881 given in combination with angiotensin I or angiotensin II potentiated the dipsogenic effect of angiotensin I, but not that of the two angiotensin II preparations.4 The drinking induced by isoprenaline (100 mug/kg, i.m.) was potentiated by SQ 20881 to the same extent as drinking produced by angiotensin I infusion.5 Angiotensin I plasma levels were determined after angiotensin I infusion and isoprenaline application. Both were significantly raised by SQ 20881.6 It is concluded that one of the mechanisms which mediate the dipsogenic effect of isoprenaline is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and that increased plasma levels of angiotensin I may play a substantial role in this type of drinking."
