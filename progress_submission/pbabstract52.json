    "0": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is primarily localized (>90%) in various tissues and organs, most notably on the endothelium but also within parenchyma and inflammatory cells. Tissue ACE is now recognized as a key factor in cardiovascular and renal diseases. Endothelial dysfunction, in response to a number of risk factors or injury such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesteremia, and cigarette smoking, disrupts the balance of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, vascular smooth muscle cell growth, the inflammatory and oxidative state of the vessel wall, and is associated with activation of tissue ACE. Pathologic activation of local ACE can have deleterious effects on the heart, vasculature, and the kidneys. The imbalance resulting from increased local formation of angiotensin II and increased bradykinin degradation favors cardiovascular disease. Indeed, ACE inhibitors effectively reduce high blood pressure and exert cardio- and renoprotective actions. Recent evidence suggests that a principal target of ACE inhibitor action is at the tissue sites. Pharmacokinetic properties of various ACE inhibitors indicate that there are differences in their binding characteristics for tissue ACE. Clinical studies comparing the effects of antihypertensives (especially ACE inhibitors) on endothelial function suggest differences. More comparative experimental and clinical studies should address the significance of these drug differences and their impact on clinical events.", 
    "1": "Evidence from a broad range of studies demonstrates that atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that, from its origins to its ultimate complications, involves inflammatory cells (T cells, monocytes, macrophages), inflammatory proteins (cytokines, chemokines), and inflammatory responses from vascular cells (endothelial cell expression of adhesion molecules). Investigators have identified a variety of proteins whose levels might predict cardiovascular risk. Of these candidates, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 have been most widely studied. There is also the prospect of inflammation as a therapeutic target, with investigators currently debating to what extent the decrease in cardiovascular risk seen with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands derives from changes in inflammatory parameters. These advances in basic and clinical science have placed us on a threshold of a new era in cardiovascular medicine.", 
    "2": "Cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death for men and women in this country since 1921 and is currently the leading cause of death in the world. Adding to the sense of urgency about disease prevention is the recent finding that the initial lesions of atherosclerotic vascular disease may begin within the first year of life-or even earlier, during fetal growth. However, the pathobiology of atherosclerosis (and in particular, the key role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is now well understood. Activation of 3 major oxidative systems as well as the renin-angiotensin system-all located in the vascular wall-is an early step. In fact, the effects of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the vascular wall (improved endothelial function, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and plaque stabilization) are an important mechanism of benefit, independent of their systemic effects. Several very positive trials with these agents have been completed. However, if this information is not incorporated into clinical practice in a timely manner, cardiovascular disease will continue to present a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.",

Blood pressure was 177.33+/-16.24/111.33+/-15.26 mm Hg before and 143.41+/-17.34/91.29+/-12.54 mm Hg after treatment (p < 0.05/p < 0.05). Nine persons (age 37+/-6.2 yr) with normal blood pressure (121.33+/-9.9/78+/-5.23 mm Hg) were the control group. Blood samples were taken from the ulnar vein at 8.00 AM (0 h), before taking zinc orally (one tablet of Zincas (zinc aspartate), containing 5 mg Zn2+) and at 1, 3, and 6 h after the dose. Serum zinc concentration in control and hypertensive group (before treatment) were initially 15.47+/-6.26 versus 15.99+/-5.65 (NS), 19.37+/-6.40 versus 20.83+/-4.48 (NS) after 1 h, 17.91+/-4.76 versus 31.32+/-10.49 (p < 0.003) after 3 h, and 15.32+/-5.47 versus 17.87+/-6.56 (NS) after 6 h.

Forearm vascular resistance was significantly decreased after two weeks of treatment. Imidapril significantly augmented RH after 12 weeks of treatment from the pretreatment values (31.6 +/- 5.7 to 38.2 +/- 6.0 m/min per 100 ml tissue, p < 0.05), whereas amlodipine did not alter RH for each treatment period. The ability of imidapril to improve RH was maintained throughout the 48-week treatment period. There was no significant difference in RH at 12, 24 and 48 weeks. The increase in FBF after sublingual administration of NTG was similar in all treatment periods for the two groups.

Effectiveness of moxonidine and enalapril administration (during 24 weeks) depended on the basal ACE activity in the hypertensive patients: (a) in the group of patients with low basal ACE activity moxonidine very effectively decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, compared with the group of patients with high basal ACE activity; (b) influence of enalapril on the level of arterial blood pressure was more pronounced with high basal ACE activity.",

For some therapeutics like carvedilol and captopril used in the treatment of such diseases antioxidant properties have been proposed to play a role in addition to their haemodynamic activities. It was the aim of the present study to assess whether ROS may affect the molecular integrity and the primary pharmacological actions of compounds with additional antioxidant properties. Accordingly, well-known drugs as mentioned were exposed to ROS, generated by electrolysis and analyzed by means of functional and chemical investigations. For this purpose rat thoracic aortic rings were incubated with either the beta1,2/alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol (100 nM), the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (5 nM), the thiol-containing ACE-inhibitor captopril (3 microM) or lisinopril (300 nM), an ACE-inhibitor without a thiol moiety. Furthermore, isolated rat left atria were incubated with either carvedilol (14 nM) or with the beta1,2-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol (50 nM). After an incubation period of 15 min, electrolysis was applied to the buffer medium in order to generate ROS. After an additional 15 min, concentration-response curves were constructed for angiotensin I and phenylephrine in thoracic aortic rings incubated with the ACE-inhibitors and the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively. In addition, concentration-response curves were constructed for isoprenaline in presence of the beta1,2-adrenoceptor antagonists in isolated left atria. After exposure to oxidative stress the alpha1- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of carvedilol was significantly impaired, when compared to control conditions. In contrast, the pharmacological effects of prazosin and timolol remained unaffected. The ACE-inhibition by captopril was completely abolished after electrolysis, while the pharmacological action of lisinopril was only slightly reduced. In addition, a complete oxidative degradation of captopril and carvedilol could be demonstrated by using UV/Vis spectroscopy and HPLC/fluorospectroscopy, respectively. From these results we conclude that the haemodynamic therapeutics with additional radical scavenging properties may undergo a chemical modification due to ROS-exposure which results in a loss of pharmacological activity.",

Significant positive correlations exist between the transcardiac gradient of ALD at the acute phase and the LVEDVI at one month. Moreover, the transcardiac gradient of plasma ALD at the acute phase has a significant correlation with plasma PIIINP, a biochemical marker of fibrosis, after one month.

Although some questions remain regarding the diagnosis and mortality of CHF in the doxazosin arm and regarding the risk of dying from malignancy in the diuretic arm of ALLHAT, drugs used to treat hypertension should lower the CHF risk.

Oral calcium channel blockers (CCB's), nimodipine and nicardipine reduced systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference 10.9mmHg, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 19.7), diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference 9.5mmHg, 95% confidence interval 4.0 to 15.1) and heart rate (weighted mean difference 4.7 beats per minute, 95% confidence interval 0.2 to 9.2) at 48 hours. The greatest fall in blood pressure over the first 24 hours was shown in patients given the highest dose of nimodipine. ACE-I (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), perindopril and captopril reduced systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference 15.0 mmHg, 95% confidence interval -0.6 to 30.6) and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference 11.8 mmHg (weighted mean difference 95% confidence interval 4.2 to 19.4) at 24 hours. Glyceryl trinitrate showed a non significant reduction in blood pressure at 24 hours. None of the drugs significantly affected outcome. The limited amount of data made it impossible to assess the relationship between change in blood pressure and clinical outcome. No completed studies of interventions to raise blood pressure were identified.", 
    "67": "There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effect of altering blood pressure on outcome during the acute phase of stroke. Oral CCB's, ACE inhibitors and glyceryl trinitrate all appear to lower blood pressure in patients with acute stroke.", 
    "68": "The transport of peptides was studied with isolated preparations of rumen and omasum tissue of sheep by using the conventional Ussing-chamber method and isolated ruminal cells (REC). Mucosal addition of glycyl-L-glutamine, captopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) or cefadroxil (beta-lactam antibiotic) did not change the short-circuit current (I(sc)), or tissue conductance (G(t)). The intracellular pH, pH(i), in isolated REC was not influenced by the addition of peptides to the buffer solution. These findings do not support the assumption of proton-coupled or electrogenic peptide transport. The determination of unidirectional flux rates of the peptide D-phenylalanyl-L-alanine (2,3-(3)H) showed that the flux rate in the serosal-mucosal direction, J(sm), was greater than J(ms), leading to a small net secretion of peptide. Transport was not significantly inhibited by the serosal addition of ouabain. Enhancing the paracelluIar permeability by an increase of osmotic pressure in the mucosal solution (FREYER and MARTENS, Proc. Soc. Nutr. Physiol. 8, 80, 1999) caused an increase of G(t) and significantly higher transport rates of peptide. The flux rates of peptides (in the nanomolar range) may therefore represent passive and possibly paracellular diffusion and are not of nutritional importance.", 
    "69": "To examine the effect of low-dose losartan, an angiotensin II antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive Type 1 diabetes mellitus, 16 subjects with Type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to two 2-month treatment periods, with either losartan (25 mg/day) or enalapril (5 mg/day) in a single-blind cross-over design. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE), blood pressures, lipids, glycemia, HbA1C, serum potassium and creatinine clearance were measured before and after each treatment period. The UAEs were similarly reduced after both treatments. The median UAE decreased by 27.8%, from 162 (range 65-250) to 117 (34-190) mg/day (p<0.01) after enalapril, and decreased by 25%, from 160 (60-246) to 120 (36-184) mg/day (p<0.01) after losartan. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures also decreased significantly (p<0.05), whereas serum levels of potassium increased (p<0.01) after both treatments. The levels of serum HbA1c, mean fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and creatinine clearances were not significantly (p>0.05 in all) changed by either the enalapril or losartan treatment. No significant differences were found between the effects of enalapril and losartan. In conclusion, losartan treatment reduces microalbuminuria as effectively as enalapril in normotensive Type 1 diabetic patients.",

The usefulness of these agents is limited by cardiotoxicity, with congestive heart failure developing in up to 20% of patients. To stratify possible risk factors, we investigated 38 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for signs of late cardiomyopathy. Exercise-spiroergometry and stress-echocardiography with measurement of fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) as indicators of left ventricular function were performed. ECG, 24 h Holter monitoring, chest X-ray, virus serology and carnitine were analysed. Control subjects were 38 healthy children matched for age and body surface area. All 38 patients had normal echocardiographic findings at rest (EF: 0.73 +/- 0.06; FS: 0.35 +/- 0.05). ten patients had a significant attenuation of left ventricular function after exercise assessed by stress-echocardiography compared to the remaining 28 patients and 38 healthy control subjects (EF: 0.52 +/- 0.08 versus 0.77 +/- 0.06 and 0.80 +/- 0.08; FS: 0.29 +/- 0.06 versus 0.39 +/- 0.05 and 0.41 +/- 0.02); patients with reduced ventricular function after exercise had significant low anaerobic threshold, subnormal maximal oxygen uptake and decreased carnitine levels. The findings were not related to the dosage of administered doxorubicin. There exists no correlation between ECG, 24 h ECG, chest X-ray, virology and left ventricular dysfunction. The benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and the administration of carnitine remains speculative.",

Temocapril hydrochloride (5 mg/day) was administered to 32 hypertensive type 2 diabetes patients for 16 weeks. During treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly from 162/95 mmHg to 138/76 mmHg at 16 weeks (p<0.001), and serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) showed significant reduction, but those of HbA1c, triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) showed no significant changes.

She subsequently underwent a percutaneous renal biopsy, which was consistent with fibrillary glomerulopathy. This condition is rare in children and is identified histologically by a solid, randomly arranged, amyloid-like fibrillar structure with a diameter of about 18-22 nm. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, the clinical presentation of which can be quite varied. Children usually present with nephrotic syndrome. There is no effective therapy for this condition. Therapy with steroids, cytotoxic agents, and plasmapheresis does not confer any real benefit in stabilizing or improving renal function. However, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can decrease the proteinuria. End-stage renal disease is known to occur in 50% of patients within 4 years of diagnosis.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that patients over age 75 represent a large subgroup with an exceptionally high case-fatality rate, most randomized clinical trials have enrolled few patients in this group. As a result, therapeutic recommendations for managing acute MI in the very elderly are often extrapolated from studies conducted in younger patients. This article reviews current evidence-based guidelines for early treatment of acute MI in the elderly. As in younger patients, aspirin, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered standard therapy in appropriately selected elderly patients. Although the benefits of reperfusion therapy (i.e., thrombolysis and primary angioplasty) are less well established, advanced age per se should not be considered a contraindication to the use of these interventions. Given the relative paucity of data in the very elderly, additional studies are needed to define optimal pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of acute MI in this rapidly growing, high-risk population.",

Anticoagulants should be administered post-MI to patients unable to tolerate daily aspirin, to those with persistent atrial fibrillation, and to those with left ventricular thrombus. Nitrates, along with beta blockers, should be used to treat angina pectoris. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be administered after MI to patients who have congestive heart failure, an anterior MI, or a left ventricular ejection fraction of at or below 40%. There are no class I indications for the use of calcium channel blockers after MI. Complex ventricular arrhythmias should be treated with beta blockers. Persons with life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation or who are at very high risk for sudden cardiac death after MI should receive an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. There are no class I indications for the use of hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women after MI. Indications for coronary revascularization after MI in older individuals are prolongation of life and relief of unacceptable symptoms despite optimal medical management.",

    "95": "The telencephalon is formed in the most anterior part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is organised into ventral subpallial and dorsal pallial domains. In mice, it has been demonstrated that Fgf signalling has an important role in induction and patterning of the telencephalon. However, the precise role of Fgf signalling is still unclear, owing to overlapping functions of Fgf family genes. To address this, we have examined, in zebrafish embryos, the activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), one of the major downstream targets of Fgf signalling. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a vertebrate MAPK is activated in the anterior neural boundary (ANB) of the developing CNS at early segmentation stages. Experiments with Fgf inhibitors reveal that ERK activation at this stage is totally dependent on Fgf signalling. Interestingly, a substantial amount of ERK activation is observed in ace mutants in which fgf8 gene is mutated. We then examine the function of Fgf signalling in telencephalic development by use of several inhibitors to Fgf signalling cascade, including dominant-negative forms of Ras (Ras(N17)) and the Fgf receptor (Fgfr), and a chemical inhibitor of Fgfr, SU5402. In treated embryos, the induction of telencephalic territory normally proceeded but the development of the subpallial telencephalon was suppressed, indicating that Fgf signalling is required for the regionalisation within the telencephalon. Finally, antisense experiments with morpholino-modified oligonucleotides suggest that zebrafish fgf3, which is also expressed in the ANB, co-operates with fgf8 in subpallial development.",

Heterogeneity was significant between trials because of high risk of cardiovascular events on doxazosin in one trial, and high risk of stroke on captopril in another; but systolic pressure differed between groups in these two trials by 2-3 mm Hg. Similar systolic differences occurred in a trial of diltiazem versus old drugs, and in three trials of converting-enzyme inhibitor against placebo in high-risk patients.

The effect of long-term treatment of rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) following acute myocardial infarction with trandolapril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on heat shock-induced Hsp72 and Hsp73 production was examined. 2. Acute myocardial infarction was induced by coronary artery ligation (CAL). The animals with CAL showed symptoms of CHF at the 8th week after the operation. The hearts isolated from animals with CAL at the 2nd and 8th week after surgery were subjected to hyperthermia at 42 degrees C for 15 min followed by 6-h perfusion (hyperthermia/6-h perfusion). 3. In the hearts isolated from the animals at the 2nd week, an approximate 20% decline in the rate pressure product (RPP) was seen after hyperthermia/6-h perfusion, which was similar to that in non-operated controls. In contrast, a significant reduction in the RPP after hyperthermia/6-h perfusion was seen in the hearts of rats with CHF. These hearts did not increase Hsp72 and Hsp73 production after hyperthermia. The decline in RPP was associated with failure in the production of myocardial Hsp72 and Hsp73. 4. When rats with CAL were treated with 3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) trandolapril from the 2nd to 8th week after the operation, the decline in RPP of the failing heart after hyperthermia was similar to that of the sham-operated rats. The induction of myocardial Hsp72 and Hsp73 production of the coronary artery-ligated rats after hyperthermia was reversed by treatment with trandolapril. 5. These findings suggest that the preserved ability to induce Hsp72 and Hsp73 production in the heart with CAL by trandolapril treatment may be attributed to the increased tolerance against heat stress-induced deterioration of myocardial contractile function.",

Postoperative renal impairment was defined as a 20% decrease in GFR between Day 0 (before surgery) and Day 7 +/-1 day (after surgery). Preoperative and intraoperative variables considered as potentially responsible for postoperative renal impairment were tested. Chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) was the only factor significantly associated with postoperative renal impairment (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 2.01 [1.05-3.83]). Chronic preoperative ACEI treatment is significantly associated with postoperative renal impairment. Inhibition of renal compensatory mechanisms caused by renin angiotensin system blockade might be responsible for the observed decrease in renal function in patients chronically treated with ACEIs undergoing aortic surgery. However, age and preoperative renal dysfunction were not associated with a postoperative decrease in GFR, but they were associated with a postoperative creatinine clearance <60 mL/min.", 
    "118": "The aim of this study was to identify preoperative risk factors responsible for postoperative renal impairment in vascular surgery. Chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment was the only factor significantly associated with postoperative renal impairment. Inhibition of renal compensatory mechanisms caused by renin angiotensin system blockade might be responsible for the observed decreased renal function.", 
    "119": "Comorbidity is an important confounder in epidemiologic studies. The authors compared the predictive performance of comorbidity scores for use in epidemiologic research with administrative databases. Study participants were British Columbia, Canada, residents aged >or=65 years who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers at least once during the observation period. Six scores were computed for all 141,161 participants during the baseline year (1995-1996). Endpoints were death and health care utilization during a 12-month follow-up (1996-1997). Performance was measured by using the c statistic ranging from 0.5 for chance prediction of outcome to 1.0 for perfect prediction. In logistic regression models controlling for age and gender, four scores based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) generally performed better at predicting 1-year mortality (c = 0.771, c = 0.768, c = 0.745, c = 0.745) than medication-based Chronic Disease Score (CDS)-1 and CDS-2 (c = 0.738, c = 0.718). Number of distinct medications used was the best predictor of future physician visits (R(2) = 0.121) and expenditures (R(2) = 0.128) and a good predictor of mortality (c = 0.745). Combining ICD-9 and medication-based scores improved the c statistics (1.7% and 6.2%, respectively) for predicting mortality. Generalizability of results may be limited to an elderly, predominantly White population with equal access to state-funded health care.", 
    "120": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed and validated for the kinetic investigation of the chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis of benazepril hydrochloride. Kinetic studies on the acidic hydrolysis of benazepril hydrochloride were carried out in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution at 50, 53, 58 and 63 degrees C. Benazepril hydrochloride appeared stable in a pH 7.4 phosphate buffered solution at 37 degrees C and showed susceptibility to undergoing in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis with porcine liver esterase (PLE) in a pH 7.4 buffered solution at 37 degrees C. Benazeprilat appeared to be the major degradation product in both (chemical and enzymatic) studies of hydrolysis. Statistical evaluation of the proposed HPLC methods revealed their good linearity and reproducibility. Relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) was less than 4.76, while detection limits for benazepril hydrochloride and benazeprilat were 13.0 x 10(-7) and 9.0 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Treatment of the kinetic data of the acidic hydrolysis was carried out by non-linear regression analysis and k values were determined. The kinetic parameters of the enzymatic hydrolysis were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the data using the equation of Michaelis-Menten.", 
    "121": "A coated-wire benazepril-selective electrode based on incorporation of the benazepril-tetraphenylborate ion pair in a poly(vinylchloride) coating membrane was constructed. The influences of membrane composition, temperature, pH of the test solution, and foreign ions on the electrode performance were investigated. The electrode showed a Nernstian response over a benazepril concentration range of 1.26x10(-5) to 0.58x10(-2) M, at 25 degrees C, and was found to be very selective, precise, and usable within the pH range 2.5-9.2. The standard electrode potentials, E degrees, were determined at 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 degrees C, and used to calculate the isothermal temperature coefficient (dE degrees /dT) of the electrode. Temperatures higher than 45 degrees C seriously affect the electrode performance. The electrode was successfully used for potentiometric determination of benazepril hydrochloride both in pure solutions and in pharmaceutical preparations.", 
    "122": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs is characterized by ventricular and atrial enlargement, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with congestive heart failure (CHF) often developing at some stage. With greater understanding of the impact of neuroendocrine stimulation in heart disease, the understanding of the pathophysiology for CHF has changed considerably. It is no longer considered only to be a simple haemodynamic consequence of pump dysfunction, but is now characterized as a complex clinical syndrome with release of many neurohormones, which are believed to have impact on the progression of disease. This change in our understanding of the pathophysiology of CHF has important therapeutic implications. There are strong indications, although not yet proven, that drugs designed to influence the neuroendocrine activity, such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-receptors antagonists, are efficacious as adjunct therapy of heart failure attributable to DCM in dogs. The benefits of drugs designed to influence the myocardial contractile state (positive inotropes) have not been fully evaluated. However, evidence has emerged in recent years indicating that new types of positive inotropes may be beneficial in dogs with DCM. This review focuses on the neuroendocrine aspects of DCM and their possible therapeutic implications and the place for long-term inotropic support in dogs with DCM.", 
    "123": "The familiar diuretic spironolactone has taken on new life as a treatment for left-sided congestive heart failure. Spironolactone has been shown to decrease mortality in such patients who are New York Heart Association class IV. It can be used in addition to agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, which also decrease mortality, and diuretics and digoxin, which are useful in treating symptoms. Spironolactone is safe, easy to use and reasonably priced. More research is necessary to determine the order and combinations of these medications in slowing the progression of this disease.", 
    "124": "In type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria not receiving antihypertensive treatment, an increase in urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) of 6% to 14%/year and a risk for the development of diabetic nephropathy of 3% to 30%/year have previously been reported. The aim of the present study was to audit the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the progression of microalbuminuria and development of diabetic nephropathy. We consecutively identified 227 type 1 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria (urinary AER between 30 and 300mg/24h, ELISA). According to the level (> or = 100 or < 100mg/24 h) and/or rate of progression in urinary AER (>6% or < or =6%/year), patients were divided into a high-risk group (n= 177) and a low-risk group (n= 50) for development of diabetic nephropathy. According to international guidelines, all patients at high-risk were recommended ACE-inhibitor treatment. Throughout the study, 67% of the patients were treated with an ACE inhibitor. Urinary AER significantly declined by 8.3%/year (95% CI: 2.8 to 13.9) in the whole group of patients, and the risk for the development of diabetic nephropathy during follow-up was 3.5%/year. Glycaemic control and blood pressure remained unchanged during the study. The implementation of modified international guidelines regarding the use of ACE inhibition in the treatment of microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients reduced progression to diabetic nephropathy comparable to what has previously been reported in intervention trials.", 
    "125": "Chronic heart failure is one of the most serious medical problems in the United States, affecting some 4 million persons. In spite of its common occurrence, and comprehensive literature regarding this condition, no unifying hypothesis has been accepted to explain the signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure. The cardiocirculatory and neurohormonal models place an emphasis on left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output and do not provide appropriate explanations for the symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue. The muscle hypothesis supplements these conventional models. It proposes that abnormal skeletal muscle in heart failure results in activation of muscle ergoreceptors, leading to an increase in ventilation and sensation of breathlessness, the perception of fatigue, and sympathetic activation. At least one fourth of patients with chronic heart failure are limited by skeletal muscle abnormalities rather than cardiac output. Cardiac rehabilitation exercise can lead to an increase in exercise capacity that is superior to that gained from digitalis or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Exercise tends to reverse the skeletal muscle myopathy of chronic heart failure and reduces the abnormal ergoreflex. Other interventions that have been shown to have a favorable outcome include localized muscle group training, respiratory muscle training, and dietary approaches. The possibility that osteopathic manipulative treatment might be of benefit is an attractive, but untested, possibility.", 
    "126": "This study aimed to assess the impact of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) on the secretion and expression of renin in the kidney cortex. For this purpose renocortical COX-2 expression was moderately stimulated by a low-salt diet or strongly stimulated (increase in mRNA about fivefold) by the combination of a low-salt diet and the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in male Sprague-Dawley rats. None of these manoeuvres changed medullary COX-2 expression or cortical or medullary COX-1 expression. Treatment with low salt plus ramipril but not with low salt alone led to a three- to fourfold increase of the urinary output of all major prostanoids. The selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (10 mg/kg per day) markedly lowered basal urinary prostanoid excretion and blunted the stimulation of prostanoid excretion during treatment with low salt plus ramipril. The stimulation of renin secretion by the low-salt diet but not by low salt plus ramipril was attenuated by rofecoxib. The low-salt diet led to a moderate increase of renin gene expression, and additional treatment with ramipril caused a 15-fold increase of renin mRNA. However, no effect of rofecoxib on renin gene expression was observed in any group. These findings suggest that stimulation of COX-2 in the renal cortex leads to the increased formation of all major prostanoids. COX-2-derived prostanoids may play a role in the regulation of renin secretion but not in renin gene expression during the intake of a low-salt diet. However, no major relevance of COX-2-derived prostanoids to renin secretion or renin gene expression during ramipril treatment or a combination of ramipril and a low-salt diet was found.",

    "128": "Progressive Systemic Sclerosis (PSS) is still an incurable disease but there are treatments for it, and the list of proposed treatments is long. The methodology of trials concerning PSS is complex, due to the low prevalence of the disease and therefore its financial interest for pharmaceutical companies, the lack of simple end points for efficacy, and the large number of clinical expressions with various prognoses. These causes explain why most open studies are fiercely positive, and why controlled studies are so rare. The progress made during the last 10 years concern 1) the diagnosis, which is now made earlier due to capillaroscopy and antibody assays, especially of anticentromere antibodies, 2) better knowledge of the prognosis, due to the classification of PSS into limited and the diffuse forms which have different prognoses, and 3) the recognition of a serious complication of the disease, ie. pulmonary hypertension, which can now be detected by non-invasive methods. All these improvements will also improve the methodology of future trials of drugs for treating PSS. In this ocean of uncertainties, some treatments have a valid background, and 3 visceral locations of PSS can be efficiently treated: renal involvement, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, respiratory involvement, with D-penicillamine, and pulmonary hypertension, with prostacyclin derivatives. Corticosteroids are suspected to increase the risk of renal complications. Calcium blockers are considered a useful symptomatic treatment of the associated Raynaud's phenomenon and of the risk of digital necrosis, and may also constitute a treatment of PSS itself. A recent trial conducted by the French Microcirculation Society and its acrosyndrome Study Group considered the effects of an oral derivative of prostacyclin. Beneficial effects were: a reduction of the risk of digital necroses, improved overall wellbeing, less necessity for hospitalizations, fewer giant capillaries, and a dramatic fall in the level of von-Willebrand factor.",

Remission lasted 3.6 (1.0-18.1) years. More women (37%) than men (16%) obtained remission (P = 0.01). In the remission group compared with the no-remission group, mean arterial blood pressure (mean +/- SEM) was reduced (102 +/- 1 vs. 106 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.01), the rate of decline in GFR was diminished (3.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.5 +/- 0.5 ml x min(-1) x year(-1), P < 0.001), and serum cholesterol was lower (5.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P < 0.01) during the whole follow-up period.

    "137": "A glomerular permeability defect occurs early in the course of type 1 diabetes and precedes the onset of microalbuminuria and renal morphological changes. Recently, ACE inhibitors have been shown to prevent loss of glomerular membrane permselective function, but the mechanism of this nephroprotective effect is still being debated. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of hypotensive and subhypotensive dosages of the ACE inhibitor quinapril ex vivo and of its active metabolite quinaprilat in vitro on the glomerular albumin permeability (P(alb)) defect in the early phases of experimental diabetes. For the ex vivo study, six groups of male Wistar rats were evaluated for 4 weeks. One group served as a nondiabetic control (C); the other five groups were rendered diabetic and included untreated diabetic rats (D) and diabetic rats receiving quinapril at the dosages of 5 (DQ1), 2.5 (DQ2), 1.25 (DQ3), and 0.625 (DQ4) mg. kg(-1). day(-1). Dosage-dependent effects of quinapril on systolic blood pressure and the glomerular filtration rate were observed. In contrast, control of P(alb) in isolated glomeruli exposed to oncotic gradients, proteinuria, and glomerular and tubular hypertrophy was obtained with subhypotensive dosages (DQ3 and DQ4 groups) of the ACE inhibitor. In the in vitro study, quinaprilat reduced P(alb) significantly in concentration ranges from 10(-6) to 10(-14) mol/l compared with results in control glomeruli. The effect on P(alb) may have occurred by mechanisms different from kidney ACE inhibitor. These study results indicated that ACE inhibitor treatment prevents the early onset of the P(alb) defect in experimental diabetes. This effect seemed to occur independently of systemic or glomerular hemodynamic changes and, at least partially, from kidney ACE inhibition.",

The remaining patients were randomized to either the valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide or the valsartan-benazepril combination.",

    "152": "On 0.2% NaCl intake, combined blockade lowered blood pressure progressively; at day 7, rats on 0.2% NaCl developed a syndrome of listlessness and failure to eat which led to loss of weight and death. Cardiac size was dramatically reduced. Plasma creatinine was elevated to 50% above normal. There was a polyuria. The syndrome was reversed by adding NaCl to the drinking water or prevented in rats on a 4% NaCl intake. In rats on 0.2% NaCl plasma renin rose dramatically with medication and angiotensinogen became depleted. Haematocrit in all groups of rats did not differ.",

In recent years, a number of mainly retrospective studies have reached different conclusions on the risk of cancer in patients with hypertension being treated with different antihypertensive drugs. At some point or another nearly all antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to increase the risk of cancer. Some studies have even found an association between hypertension itself and increased carcinogenesis. For calcium channel antagonists, beta-blockers and alpha-blockers, the available evidence seems to favour a neutral effect on cancer development and death rate. For ACE inhibitors, the overall data suggest a similar neutral effect on cancer or, possibly, a small protective effect. Perhaps the strongest evidence in favour of a link, although probably weak, between cancer and antihypertensive drugs is with the diuretics. Until further solid data are available from prospective clinical trials, we suggest that the management of hypertension should continue according to current treatment guidelines with little fear of any substantial cancer risk.",

A study was undertaken to clarify whether an antagonist of angiotensin type 1-receptor, losartan, could be safely used in the same patient during LDL apheresis treatment. Blood pressure and humoral factors were compared between the apheresis sessions with losartan and those without. Although angiotensin II and bradykinin plasma levels during LDL apheresis were significantly greater with losartan than without, blood pressure reduction by losartan was mild and unpleasant symptoms were not induced. Losartan was thus safely used for this patient during treatment by LDL apheresis. The greater rise in bradykinin levels during apheresis with losartan might be ascribable to angiotensin type 2-receptor stimulation.", 
    "170": "It remains to be clarified whether ACE Inhibitors extend the lifespan in cases of severe hypertension. In the present study, we examined whether inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) would affect mortality in a very severe hypertensive model. Twelve-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were used, and measurements at this age were taken as the basal values. At this age, the systolic blood pressure of SHR-SP was 219+/-4 mmHg, while that of WKY was 102+/-3 mmHg. After 12 weeks of sodium loading, the systolic blood pressure in the placebo-treated SHR-SP reached to 251+/-4 mmHg. At 4 weeks of sodium loading, 85% of the placebo-treated SHR-SP had died, and the systolic blood pressure of the surviving rats was 249+/-26 mmHg. In the trandolapril-treated SHR-SP, the systolic blood pressure was gradually increased to 293+/-5 mmHg at 16 weeks, and none of the mice had died at this time point (0% mortality). The ACE activities of the aorta, brain, heart and kidney were increased in the surviving placebo-treated SHR-SP at 4 weeks compared with the basal levels, while they were significantly decreased in the trandolapril-treated SHR-SP at 16 weeks. These data demonstrate that trandolapril extends the lifespan of this severe hypertensive model, even in cases in which the blood pressure cannot be lowered.",

First, the expression of human ET-1, as well as ET receptor type A (ET-R(A)) and ET-R(B), was studied in 26 renal biopsies from patients with different renal diseases. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Second, ET-1 and ET-R(B) protein expression and localization were examined, by immunohistochemical analyses, among a homogeneous cohort of 16 patients with IgA nephropathy and different degrees of proteinuria. ET-R(B) mRNA expression was threefold higher among patients with higher-grade proteinuria [> or =2 g/24 h, n = 10; OD ratio (ODR), i.e., wild-type/mutant mRNA ratio, 1.81 +/- 0.3], compared with patients with lower-grade proteinuria (<2 g/24 h, n = 8; ODR, 0.63 +/- 0.1; P < 0.01) or control subjects (n = 9; ODR, 0.57 +/- 0.1; P < 0.01). ET-1 gene expression was significantly higher among patients with higher-grade proteinuria, compared with patients with lower-grade proteinuria (P < 0.01) or control subjects (P < 0.05). ET-R(A) mRNA expression was not different among the groups. Patients with higher-grade proteinuria who were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower ET-1 and ET-R(B) mRNA expression, which was comparable to that of control subjects. By using immunohistochemical analyses, an association between proteinuria and expression of ET-1 and ET-R(B) in proximal tubular epithelial cells and of ET-1 in glomeruli was confirmed in the separate cohort of patients with IgA nephropathy. It is concluded that the increased ET-R(B) and ET-1 mRNA and protein expression observed in animal models of renal disease is also demonstrable among patients with renal disease and high-grade proteinuria.",

The effect of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (O) and the ACE-inhibitor captopril (C) on endothelial function in the renal circulation in salt-induced hypertension were investigated. Dahl salt-sensitive rats (n = 6 per group) on standard or salt-enriched chow were treated for 8 wk with O (36 +/- 4 mg/kg per d), C (94 +/- 2 mg/kg per d), or placebo. Renal arteries were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Vascular hypertrophy was assessed by determination of standardized heart weight and aortic weight, and morphologic analysis of glomerular injury was performed. Systolic BP of salt-fed, placebo-treated animals increased to 196 +/- 6 mmHg, which was reduced by O (162 +/- 5 mmHg; P < 0.05) and C (164 +/- 7 mmHg; P < 0.05) to a comparable degree. In salt-induced hypertension, endothelium-dependent relaxations in renal arteries (56 +/- 6 versus 100 +/- 6%; P < 0.05) as well as contractions to endothelin-1 (ET-1) (98 +/- 5% versus 128 +/- 5%; P < 0.05) and big ET-1 (47 +/- 6% versus 116 +/- 7%; P < 0.05) were markedly reduced as compared with control animals, whereas standardized aortic weight and heart weight (4.9 +/- 0.4 versus 3.2 +/- 0.3 g/kg; P < 0.05) increased. Treatment with O restored endothelium-dependent relaxations (88 +/- 6%; P < 0.05 versus C) and contractions to ET-1 (120 +/- 6%) and big ET-1 (98 +/- 9%). O prevented vascular hypertrophy (0.23 +/- 0.019 mg/mm(2) versus 0.31 +/- 0.018 mg/mm(2) in high-salt diet; P < 0.05), but, in contrast to C, it only had a modest effect on glomerular injury.

S-Ac-N-Boc-L-Cys-D(L)-ThrOMe 7a,b have been prepared and, after transformation into the corresponding mesylates, used as the cyclization substrates. Treatment of these compounds with LiAlH(OMe)(3) in THF results in mesylate elimination and thiolacetate reduction, giving rise to both a Michael acceptor (alpha,beta-unsaturated ester) and Michael donor (thiol anion), which undergo in situ intramolecular conjugate addition leading to the stereoselective formation of only two of the four possible stereoisomers of 2. On the other hand, PCC/CaCO(3) oxidation of 7a gave in 80% yield the corresponding ketone 11, which was in turn transformed into the enol triflate 15. Cleavage of the thiolacetate moiety, simultaneous elimination of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid to generate an allene system, and addition of the thiol group to the central carbon of the allene to provide the enantiomerically pure cyclic compound 3 in 85% yield was effected via a one-pot reaction by means of MeONa/MeOH.

For the artificial substrate furanacryloyl-L-phenylalanylglycylglycine (FAPGG), the enzyme exhibited a Michaelis constant (K(m)) of 0.18 mM and a V(max) of 34 micromoles/(min x mg) and for hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine a K(m) of 2.65 mM and a V(max) of 163 micromoles/(min x mg) under the defined standard conditions (300 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris; pH 7.5 and 8.3, respectively). The FAPGG hydrolysis was decreased by 82.5% and 67.5% by EDTA and dithioerythritol, respectively, and was totally inhibited by specific ACE inhibitors such as captopril, P-Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Glu-Ile-Pro-Pro, and lisinopril. Optimum activity for FAPGG was with pH 6.0, 50 mM chloride, and 500 microM zinc. Under the various conditions tested, bradykinin, angiotensin (Ang) I, Ang II, and LHRH were competitors for FAPGG. Bradykinin and angiotensin I were the best competitors. The enzyme cleaved Ang I into Ang II, and the optimal conditions were with pH 7.5 and 300 mM chloride. The relationship between the carboxypeptidase activity in seminal plasma and the prediction of fertility of young rams was also studied. These results indicated a correlation between sperm concentration and ACE activity in semen but showed no statistically significant correlation between such activity and fertility of the animal. Finally, we tested the role of ACE in fertilization; no difference in the in vitro fertilization rate was observed in the presence of 10(-4) M captopril.", 
    "191": "Increased intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery predicts increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Preliminary evidence suggests that a decrease in blood pressure (BP) is associated with diminished wall thickness. It is not known if all classes of anti-hypertensive agents have similar protective effects. In this double-blind parallel-group clinical trial, 69 previously untreated patients with hypertension were allocated randomly to 1 year of treatment with either amlodipine (5-10 mg daily) or lisinopril (5-20 mg daily). Doxazosin and bendrofluazide were added if required to achieve BP control. After 12 months of treatment, clinic BP, ambulatory BP and cardiac mass were reduced similarly by the two treatment regimens. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness decreased by 0.048 mm (95% confidence intervals -0.066, -0.031 mm) in the amlodipine-treated group, but decreased by only 0.027 mm (-0.046, -0.007 mm) in the lisinopril-treated group (P<0.05 for difference between treatments). Common carotid artery lumen diameter declined significantly only in patients treated with lisinopril [amlodipine, -0.02 mm (-0.14, 0.10 mm); lisinopril, -0.21 mm (-0.32, -0.11 mm); P<0.02], while intima-media area declined similarly in the two treatment groups [amlodipine -1.32 mm(2) (-1.91, -0.74 mm(2)), lisinopril -1.26 mm(2) (-1.80, -0.72 mm(2)); not significant]. The results confirm that a decrease in BP causes regression of structural changes in the carotid artery in hypertensive patients. The nature of the structural regression differed markedly between the two treatment regimens, in spite of similar decreases in BP. The calcium channel blocker induced greater regression of common carotid artery intima-media thickness than the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. However, carotid artery wall mass, as indicated by intima-media area, was reduced to a similar extent by the two treatments. It remains to be established whether such differences confer a prognostic advantage.",

CHF 1035 is an orally active, new selective dopamine agonist, primarily activating DA2- and alpha2 receptors, thereby inhibiting norepinephrine release, which may be beneficial in heart failure. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of CHF 1035 (10 mg/day, n = 20) and placebo (n = 9) in patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction <0.45). Patients were clinically stable on diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Both acute and chronic assessments were made, including plasma neurohormones and 24-hr Holter monitoring for heart rate variability analysis. CHF1035 was generally well tolerated during the study. After 10 days, there were no significant changes between the groups regarding heart rate and blood pressure. Compared to placebo, plasma norepinephrine levels decreased on CHF1035, both in the first 4 hours and after 10 days (p<0.05 between groups). Other neurohormones (natriuretic peptides, renin, aldosteron and endothelin) were not significantly affected. Heart rate variability parameters generally increased on CHF1035, but were unaffected by placebo (p < 0.05 between groups). Short-term treatment with the selective dopaminergic agonist CHF1035 is well tolerated, reduces plasma norepinephrine concentrations and increases heart rate variability in mild chronic heart failure.",

Cardiac and renal weights, plasma aldosterone, renin activity and urinary catecholamine excretion were measured, as well as cardiac collagen. Blood pressure was lower in stenotic animals treated with CHF-1024 compared to vehicle (161 +/- 10 vs 219 +/- 10 mmHg, p < 0.01), but LV weight was similar. CHF-1024 elicited a marked dose-dependent attenuation of urinary norepinephrine excretion (1.80 +/- 0.18 in controls compared to 0.40 +/- 0.14 microg/24 h at the highest dose, p < 0.01) and of LV perivascular fibrosis. Captopril provoked a marked hypotension, reduced cardiac and body weights, plasma aldosterone concentration, dopamine excretion and perivascular collagen.

In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel chymase inhibitor, NK3201, on this proliferation in dog grafted veins. NK3201 inhibited human and dog chymases, but not rabbit ACE. NK3201 suppressed the Ang I-induced vascular contraction in isolated dog arteries in the presence of an ACE inhibitor, and the IC50 value of chymostatin and NK3201 in dog artery was 320 nM. In dog, the concentration of NK3201 in blood was about 10 microM at 24 h after oral administration of the drug (5 mg/kg). In the group treated with NK3201, each dog was administered orally 5 mg/kg per day from 5 days before to the day before the removal of the grafted veins. Each dog underwent right common carotid artery bypass grafting with the ipsilaterial external jugular vein. By 28 days after grafting, a significant vascular proliferation was observed in the grafted veins and the chymase activity was also increased significantly. Treatment with chymase inhibitor significantly suppressed the proliferation of the grafted veins and the increased chymase activity. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that oral administration of a specific chymase inhibitor, NK3201, appears useful for preventing vascular proliferation.",

In the control study, intracerebroventricular artificial cerebrospinal fluid did not change fetal swallowing (0.9 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1 swallows per minute), whereas intracerebroventricular angiotensin II significantly increased swallowing activity (1.0 +/- 0.1 versus 2.0 +/- 0.1 swallows per minute; P <.001) and fetal blood pressure (51 +/- 2 to 59 +/- 3 mm Hg; P =.003).",

    "221": "The author reviews the various factors (sodium, aldosterone, renin-angiotensin system, and norepinephrine; each of these factors being influenced by others) involved in the mechanism of human hypertension. A coherent picture is emerging, with the final pathway of these mechanisms converging on the renin-angiotensin system in the presence of a positive sodium balance and responsible for arteriolar resistance and responsiveness to pressor agents. This would correspond to the labile phase of hypertension, which leads with time to arteriolar restructuring and the increased media/lumen ratio, as demonstrated by Schiffrin and coworkers, and which can revert to normal structure with the administration of antihypertensive drugs such as converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium-blocking drugs, and antagonists of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. The author also presents the experience obtained in the Hypertension Clinic of the Clinical Research Institute of Montr\u00e9al, which has been in existence since 1953; this experience is based on the observation of senior observers (clinical scientists, clinicians, and nurses) that the blood pressure of hypertensive patients can be controlled to normal levels in almost all cases for years and decades with a proper combination of the present antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "222": "Pulse pressure has been more strongly associated with cardiovascular outcomes, especially myocardial infarction and heart failure, than has systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure in a variety of populations. Little is known, however, of the comparative effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents on pulse pressure. In retrospective analyses of the Veterans Affairs Single-Drug Therapy for Hypertension Study, we compared changes in pulse pressure with 6 classes of antihypertensive agents: 1292 men with diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 109 mm Hg on placebo were randomized to receive hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, prazosin, or placebo. Drug doses were titrated to achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg during a 4- to 8-week medication titration phase. Pulse pressure change (placebo subtracted) was assessed from baseline to the end of the 3-month titration and 1-year maintenance. Mean baseline systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures were 152, 99, and 53 mm Hg, respectively. Reductions in pulse pressure during titration were greater (P<0.001) with clonidine (6.7 mm Hg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6.2 mm Hg) than with captopril (2.5 mm Hg), diltiazem (1.6 mm Hg), and atenolol (1.4 mm Hg); reduction with prazosin (3.9 mm Hg) was similar to all but clonidine. After 1 year, pulse pressure was reduced significantly more (P<0.001) with hydrochlorothiazide (8.6 mm Hg) than with captopril and atenolol (4.1 mm Hg with both); clonidine (6.3 mm Hg), diltiazem (5.5 mm Hg), and prazosin (5.0 mm Hg) were intermediate. These data show that classes of antihypertensive agents differ in their ability to reduce pulse pressure. Whether these differences affect rates of cardiovascular events remains to be determined.", 
    "223": "International guidelines recommend that antihypertensive drug therapy should normalize not only diastolic (DBP) but also systolic blood pressure (SBP). Therapeutic trials based on cardiovascular mortality have recently shown that SBP reduction requires normalization of both large artery stiffness and wave reflections. The aim of the present study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of the very-low-dose combination indapamide (0.625 mg) and perindopril (2 mg) (Per/Ind) with the beta-blocking agent atenolol (50 mg) to determine whether Per/Ind decreases SBP and pulse pressure (PP) more than does atenolol and, if so, whether this decrease is predominantly due to reduction of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (automatic measurements) and reduction of wave reflections (pulse wave analysis, applanation tonometry). In a double-blind randomized study, 471 patients with essential hypertension were followed for 12 months. For the same DBP reduction, Per/Ind decreased brachial SBP (-6.02 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -8.90 to -3.14) and PP (-5.57; 95% confidence interval, -7.70 to -3.44) significantly more than did atenolol. This difference was significantly more pronounced for the carotid artery than for the brachial artery. Whereas the 2 antihypertensive agents decreased PWV to a similar degree, only Per/Ind significantly attenuated carotid wave reflections, resulting in a selective decrease in SBP and PP. The very-low-dose combination Per/Ind normalizes SBP, PP, and arterial function to a significantly larger extent than does atenolol, a hemodynamic profile that is known to improve survival in hypertensive populations with high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "224": "In the present study, we evaluated the effect of a nonevaluative social support intervention (pet ownership) on blood pressure response to mental stress before and during ACE inhibitor therapy. Forty-eight hypertensive individuals participated in an experiment at home and in the physician's office. Participants were randomized to an experimental group with assignment of pet ownership in addition to lisinopril (20 mg/d) or to a control group with only lisinopril (20 mg/d). On each study day, blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma renin activity were recorded at baseline and after each mental stressor (serial subtraction and speech). Before drug therapy, mean responses to mental stress did not differ significantly between experimental and control groups in heart rate (94 [SD 6.8] versus 93 [6.8] bpm), systolic blood pressure (182 [8.0] versus 181 [8.3] mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (120 [6.6] versus 119 [7.9] mm Hg), or plasma renin activity (9.4 [0.59] versus 9.3 [0.57] ng. mL(-1). h(-1)). Lisinopril therapy lowered resting blood pressure by approximately 35/20 mm Hg in both groups, but responses to mental stress were significantly lower among pet owners relative to those who only received lisinopril (P<0.0001; heart rate 81 [6.3] versus 91 [6.5] bpm, systolic blood pressure 131 [6.8] versus 141 [7.8] mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 92 [6.3] versus 100 [6.8] mm Hg, and plasma renin activity 13.9 [0.92] versus 16.1 [0.58] ng. mL(-1). h(-1)). We conclude that ACE inhibitor therapy alone lowers resting blood pressure, whereas increased social support through pet ownership lowers blood pressure response to mental stress.",

    "229": "The novel antihypertensive drugs which have been discovered and developed in the latter half of the 20th century were investigated. Newly discovered or improved drugs are approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Japan, and after then they become available for clinical use. We can follow the progress and trends of various new antihypertensive drugs by recording their years of approval. The four primary useful drugs for the treatment of hypertension were developed were introduced as listed in the following: 1. Antihypertensive diuretics: Thiazide and dihydrothiazide were first approved in 1958, and various related drugs including aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics followed. 2. beta-Adrenergic-blocking drugs: Propranolol was approved in 1966 for heart diseases and for hypertension in 1970. Thereafter many related drugs were developed. 3. Calcium channel-blocking drugs: Nifedipine was approved, for heart disease in 1974 and for hypertension in 1981, and then many related drugs appeared. 4. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: Captopril was approved in 1982 and thereafter various related drugs followed. The four categories of these drugs were selected as first choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension in 1988. The development of these excellent useful drugs affected the mortality rates of cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., apoplexy). The mortality curve reaches plateaued in 1963, peaked in 1965, and then declined rapidly. Antihypertensive diuretic drugs stop the rise of mortality, and beta-blocking drugs, Ca-antagonists and ACE-inhibitors promote rapid downward tendency.", 
    "230": "Every year, millions of Moslems throughout the world fast from sunrise till sunset daily during the month of Ramadan, that is, experience repeated cycles of fasting-refeeding. Studies in animal models have shown that repeated cycles of fasting-refeeding may cause or exacerbate hypertension. Changes in sleeping patterns as well as changes in medication timing may also influence ambulatory blood pressure. We undertook this study in order to examine the effect of the Ramadan fast on treated hypertensive subjects. Seventeen hypertensive subjects were examined, and 24-h blood pressure monitoring was carried out twice, before and during the last week of the Ramadan. All continued their medications, which were all once-daily preparations. Twenty-four hour mean blood pressure as well as average awake and average asleep blood pressure were compared. There was no difference between mean blood pressure before and during the Ramadan (138.5 +/- 18.5/77.2 +/- 8.1 mm Hg vs 136.4 +/- 20.4/75.7 +/- 5.9 mm Hg, P-nonsignificant). Blood pressure load also did not differ before and during Ramadan (systolic load 49% vs. 44%, diastolic load 21% vs. 18%, P-nonsignificant). Weight was reduced by 1.4 +/- 1.6 kg (P < 0.002). We conclude, that according to our findings, treated, hypertensive patients may be assured that, with continuation of previous medications, traditional fasting during the month of Ramadan can be safely undertaken.", 
    "231": "As the effects of sildenafil are in part mediated by enhancing the action of nitric oxide and nitrates given acutely markedly reduce early wave reflection, we explored the effects of a single oral dose of sildenafil citrate (50 mg) on blood pressure and arterial wave reflection in treated hypertensive men in a single-blind randomised placebo controlled crossover study. Eight men (aged 57-76 years) with well controlled hypertension and erectile dysfunction and no contraindications to the use of sildenafil, were given either sildenafil 50 mg or placebo orally, with the second drug being given 2 weeks later. Blood pressure and heart rate with an automated digital oscillometric device (Omron) HEM-705 CP) and the augmentation index, a measure of arterial wave reflection in the aorta derived using radial applanation tonometry, were measured before and at 15-min intervals for 2 h thereafter. The extent of individual maximum reductions (mm Hg) from baseline in systolic (24 +/- 10 vs. 6 +/- 8, P < 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (8 +/- 5 vs. 3 +/- 2, P < 0.05) occurred on the sildenafil study day. On average the brachial blood pressure at 75 min following sildenafil was 17/11 mm less than on the placebo day (P < 0.01). Augmentation index was also reduced significantly at 90 min (P < 0.05) suggesting reduced vascular tone in the arteries. The area under the brachial and aortic blood pressure and augmentation index time curve (by the trapezoidal rule corrected for baseline reading) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) on the sildenafil study day. The study shows that the peripheral vasodilatory effects of sildenafil, possibly related to nitric oxide, are accompanied by a fall in systemic blood pressure and reduced arterial wave reflection.",

    "242": "Conventionally angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with aortic stenosis. Abundant evidence is now available showing that angiotensin II has a central role in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial contractile failure and diastolic dysfunction in response to pressure overload. In animal models, ACE inhibitors have been shown to attenuate these pathological responses. In humans there is no such evidence available, however uncontrolled studies have shown that these agents are not only tolerated but are associated with acute improvements in haemodynamics and diastolic function. Further studies are merited to assess the possible role of ACE inhibitors in aortic stenosis both before and after valve replacement. Potential benefits may include prevention of LVH, improved diastolic function, reduction of arrhythmias and preservation of left ventricular function.", 
    "243": "Aldosterone, the final product of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is a mineralocorticoid hormone that classically acts, via the mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) receptor, on epithelia of the kidneys, colon, and sweat glands to maintain electrolyte homeostasis. Aldosterone has also been shown to act at nonepithelial sites where it can contribute to cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, stroke, malignant nephrosclerosis, cardiac fibrosis, ventricular hypertrophy, and myocardial necrosis. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists act to suppress the RAAS, these agents do not adequately control plasma aldosterone levels--a phenomenon termed \"aldosterone synthesis escape.\" Spironolactone, a nonselective aldosterone receptor antagonist, is an effective agent to suppress the actions of aldosterone; its use is, however, associated with progestational and antiandrogenic side effects due to its promiscuous binding to other steroid receptors. For these reasons, eplerenone--the first agent of a new class of drugs known as the selective aldosterone receptor antagonists (SARAs)--is under development. In rodent models, eplerenone provides marked protection against vascular injury in the kidney and heart. In phase II clinical trials, eplerenone demonstrates 24-h control of blood pressure with once or twice daily dosing, and is safe and well tolerated in patients with heart failure when given with standard of care agents. Pharmacokinetic studies reveal that eplerenone has good bioavailability with low protein binding, good plasma exposure, and is highly metabolized to inactive metabolites and excreted principally in the bile. Eplerenone is well tolerated in acute and chronic safety pharmacology studies. Ongoing phase III trials of eplerenone in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure are underway. These studies will extend our understanding of selective aldosterone receptor antagonism in the treatment of chronic cardiovascular disease.", 
    "244": "We have demonstrated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Japanese population (). To determine why ACE affects susceptibility to AD, we examined the effect of purified ACE on aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) in vitro. Surprisingly, ACE was found to significantly inhibit A beta aggregation in a dose response manner. The inhibition of aggregation was specifically blocked by preincubation of ACE with an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril. ACE was confirmed to retard A beta fibril formation with electron microscopy. ACE inhibited A beta deposits on a synthaloid plate, which was used to monitor A beta deposition on autopsied brain tissue. ACE also significantly inhibited A beta cytotoxicity on PC12 h. The most striking fact was that ACE degraded A beta by cleaving A beta-(1-40) at the site Asp(7)-Ser(8). This was proven with reverse-phase HPLC, amino acid sequence analysis, and MALDI-TOF/MS. Compared with A beta-(1-40), aggregation and cytotoxic effects of the degradation products A beta-(1-7) and A beta-(8-40) peptides were reduced or virtually absent. These findings led to the hypothesis that ACE may affect susceptibility to AD by degrading A beta and preventing the accumulation of amyloid plaques in vivo.",

The aim of our study was to assess the antihypertensive effect of angiotensine converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) versus beta blocker (acebutolol) in hypertensive patients. It was a double blind, placebo controlled study performed in the group of 31 patients (16 males, 15 females; mean age 46.6 +/- 8.7 years) with newly diagnosed (previously not treated) mild to moderate hypertension. Each patient in the wash-out period (two weeks) was given placebo and then was randomized to active treatment: perindopril (4 mg/day) or acebutolol (400 mg/day) for 3 weeks, following these drugs were cross matched (after one week wash out period). Blood pressure (BP) with mercury sphygmomanometer was measured three times: after 2 weeks of placebo treatment, after 3 weeks of perindopril and 3 weeks of acebutolol treatment.

Data of 220 heart recipients with the follow up > or = 3 months after HTX were analyzed using the average values of blood pressure measured with the sphigmo-manometer. 65% of patients were diagnosed with the hypertension (HA). 39.9% of those patients (NTA group) had the systolic blood pressure < or = 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg during pharmacotherapy. 60.1% of hypertensive patients (NTB group) had the systolic pressure > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure > 90 mmHg despite pharmacotherapy. 35% of all patients had normal blood pressure after HTX (HNA group). Patients with hypertension were older and the end stage ischemic cardiomyopathy was more frequently indication for HTX. Significantly more females were in NTA group. We observed no influence of the daily dose of cyclosporine or other immunosuppressive drugs on HA. The average blood concentration of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil was similar in all groups. The calcium channel blockers and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme were main tool of pharmacotherapy used. In NTA group calcium channels blockers were used more frequently. In NTB group there was a statistically significant higher blood level of creatinine. After HTX there is a high risk of HA, which: increases with age, with the ischemic cardiomyopathy as indication to HTX, is significantly higher in males, there is no correlation between HA and the dosage and blood level of cyclosporine, increases with kidney insufficiency. In monotherapy calcium channel blockers seem to be especially effective.", 
    "248": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent a major advance in the treatment of: hypertension, and generally speaking, in cardiovascular prevention; myocardial infarction; cardiac failure. They have a cardio and vascular protective action by tending to correct hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling, endothelial dysfunction, arterial smooth muscle proliferation and thrombotic phenomena. However, besides the cough that this therapeutic class engenders, a major question remains unanswered: is there resistance to this family of drugs? In other words, does left ventricular remodelling and arterial smooth muscle proliferation continue with regular treatment at the prescribed dosages? The synthesis of angiotensin II does not only depend on the angiotensin converting enzyme but also on the quality of angiotensin I and the presence of other enzymes such as chymase. A secondary increase of angiotensin II with ACE inhibitor therapy may reflect insufficient blockade of the renin-angiotensin system or a synthesis of angiotensin II by an alternative pathway to the converting enzyme. In vivo measurement of ACE inhibition shows that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is automatically limited due to the very accurate regulation of angiotensin II concentrations.", 
    "249": "Fatal arrhythmias may be prevented by long-term oral administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor antagonists. However, there have been no studies evaluating the electrophysiologic changes that occur with the acute administration of AT 1 receptor antagonists during acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of candesartan to prevent fatal arrhythmias during acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was ligated for 10 min and then reperfused for 10 min in 45 adult mongrel dogs. Candesartan (1 mg/kg) or saline was administered intravenously 10 min before ligation of the LAD coronary artery (candesartan group [n = 20] and control group [n = 25], respectively). Changes in ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) and intramyocardial conduction time (ICT) in the risk area were compared during LAD occlusion and reperfusion. Ischemia-induced shortening of ERP was inhibited in the candesartan group compared with the control. There was a 4.7 +/- 5.8% increase in ERP in the candesartan group, compared with a 11.5 +/- 6.3% shortening in the control group (p < 0.01). Prolongation of ICT was inhibited in the candesartan group compared with the control group during both ischemia and reperfusion (maximal prolongation of ICT: 0.1 +/- 3.0% vs. 37.7 +/- 9.6%, respectively; p < 0.01). Incidence of ventricular fibrillation was lower in the candesartan group than in the control group (25% [5/20] vs. 72% [18/25], respectively; p < 0.01). Candesartan suppresses changes in ERP and ICT during acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, suggesting that candesartan can prevent the development of fatal arrhythmias.", 
    "250": "The authors tested the hypothesis that angiotensin II modulates cardiovascular responses to dynamic exercise via peripheral and central effects on the autonomic nervous system. Ten subjects performed three identical exercise tests during treatment with placebo, valsartan (an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker), or enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). With placebo, plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were elevated during cycling at 80% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Enalapril attenuated increases in heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and catecholamines during cycling, whereas valsartan only attenuated MAP and rate-pressure product above 60% HRR, and norepinephrine. The different responses provoked by the two drug treatments suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition affects cardiovascular responses to exercise by mechanisms unrelated to production of angiotensin II. Indices of autonomic function during dynamic exercise were not changed by either drug. Attenuation of norepinephrine release during exercise by valsartan suggests that angiotensin II facilitates the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic postganglionic neurons. Angiotensin II, therefore, contributes to the pressor response to exercise by inducing peripheral vasoconstriction and facilitation of norepinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings that are unrelated to central activation of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "251": "Telmisartan is a new angiotensin receptor antagonist possessing potent, selective, and insurmountable inhibitory activity specific to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor. The current study was performed to determine the inhibition of the angiotensin II pressor response by telmisartan in 48 healthy volunteers challenged with hypertension-inducing doses of i.v. angiotensin II. Subjects were challenged with this dose of angiotensin II at intervals between 0.25 and 48 h after double-blind single-dose oral administration of telmisartan 20 mg (n = 12), 40 mg (n = 12), or 80 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12) in parallel groups. Diastolic and systolic blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded continuously using a servophotoplethysmograph. Urine samples were collected during the study for urinalysis. Tolerability of telmisartan, in comparison with placebo, was also monitored throughout the study. Telmisartan 20-80 mg dose dependently inhibited the increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure induced by angiotensin II. Telmisartan 40 mg produced 80.1% maximum inhibition, and with 80 mg 89.6% maximum inhibition of diastolic blood pressure was achieved. Inhibition was apparent after 0.3-1.1 h and was still observed 48 h after administration for all telmisartan doses. The inhibitory effect of telmisartan 20, 40, and 80 mg, 48 h after dosing was significantly greater than that of placebo. A > 25% inhibition of the angiotensin II response on diastolic blood pressure was detected until 26.9, 35.4, and 40.5 h, respectively, after telmisartan 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg. Anti-clockwise hysteresis was observed, indicating a delay and longer persistence of effect than to be expected from the plasma concentration-time course. The slow dissociation of telmisartan from the receptor probably contributed to this hysteresis. The incidence of adverse events was comparable in telmisartan-and placebo-treated subjects and was not dose dependent. In conclusion, telmisartan 40 mg provides rapid-onset, well-tolerated, and near-maximal inhibition of angiotensin II-induced hypertension, with maintenance of the inhibitory effect for 48 h.",

    "257": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors continue to find new uses. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study has demonstrated their wide application as a preventive measure for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, but the available clinical trials in hypertensive subjects do not so far suggest any clear superiority over conventional treatment. The available trials may have been underpowered to detect non-blood pressure-related benefits on smooth muscle growth, endothelial function, left ventricular hypertrophy, and plaque rupture, when used in relatively low-risk subjects with uncomplicated hypertension. Clinical trials have also shown that two or more drugs are needed to lower blood pressure even to 140/90. Few patients have uncomplicated hypertension, so the choice of their drugs will be powerfully influenced by their other clinical problems. Nevertheless, there is a strong case for an attack on the renin-angiotensin system. Whether this will be by ACE inhibition, angiotensin-II receptor blockade, or both, is the subject of current clinical trials.", 
    "258": "Despite recent advances, ventricular arrhythmias continue to pose a therapeutic challenge, especially to the clinician in the developing world. Although the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has improved survival in both primary and secondary prevention trials, it still remains a costly modality for the developing world. Even though certain subgroups stand to benefit unequivocally in survival from the ICD, there are others in whom this therapy may not offer a survival benefit over empiric antiarrhythmic drug therapy with amiodarone. The utility of optimized drug therapy (including either amiodarone or sotalol, b-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) needs to be compared with the ICD in a randomized manner in these lower-risk patients with ventricular arrhythmias. The role of conventional catheter ablation techniques is mostly adjunctive to drugs and ICDs, although the newer mapping and ablation techniques may offer greater promise in the future.",

The odds ratio for carriers of the less frequent ET(A)T allele to die within 2 years after diagnosis was 5.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 21.0, P=0.013) compared to non-carriers. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly different survival time for T allele carriers as compared to non-carriers as tested by logrank (P=0.0196), Breslow (P=0.0195), and Tarone tests (P=0.020). The influence of the ETA H323H polymorphism on survival remained significant when known predictors of prognosis such as left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, age and NYHA functional classification were entered in a Cox proportional hazards analysis. In this model, end-diastolic diameter showed a trend to influence survival (P=0.07) but only the ETA H323H polymorphism (P=0.0029) was a significant independent predictor of survival.",

Apoptosis in cardiomyocytes of SHR was quantified by a maximal labeling (Lmax) method and the characteristic features of apoptosis were identified by electron microscopy (EM), in situ labeling of DNA strand breaks with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP end labeling (TUNEL) and autoradiographic analysis of DNA fragments.", 
    "266": "The results of a quantitative method showed an age-dependent increase in apoptosis in the cardiac tissues of SHR. A significant increase in DNA breaks occurred as early as 4 weeks and continued to increase up to a plateau at 16 weeks in the cardiac tissue of SHR whereas there was no significant change in apoptosis in WKY up to 64 weeks. Moreover, after the treatment of SHR with ramipril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), from 3 to 10 or from 5 to 10 weeks of age, the DNA fragmentation as well as blood pressure (BP) was reduced significantly compared with that of untreated SHR (P < 0.01), and similar to that of the control WKY.",

The etiology is not completely elucidated and the clinical importance remains speculative.", 
    "269": "In this prospective clinical trial, we assessed the incidence of postoperative low systemic vascular resistance in 800 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve replacement. We have attempted to identify the predictive factors responsible for the presence of low systemic vascular resistance and we have examined the subsequent postoperative outcome of those patients who developed early postoperative vasoplegia. The severity of vasoplegia was divided into three groups according either to the value of systemic resistance and/or the dose of vasoconstrictive agents necessary to correct the hemodynamic.",

Low systemic vascular resistance did not affect hospital mortality but was the cause for delayed extubation and prolonged stay on the intensive care unit (ICU). Logistic regression analysis identified temperature and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, total cardioplegic volume infused, reduced left ventricular function, and preoperative treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, out of 25 parameters, as predictive factors for early postoperative vasoplegia.",

    "272": "Intravenous (iv) infusion of the angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor blocker saralasin in resting conscious dogs during physiological pertubations, such as hypotension and prolonged hypoxia, indicates the presence of an ANG II drive to increase respiration and decrease the arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2). In contrast, in eupneic resting dogs on a regular chow diet, iv infusion of saralasin for short periods (up to 30 min) provides no evidence of a tonic effect of circulating levels of ANG II on acid-base balance, respiration, metabolism, or circulation. However, ANG II influences physiological processes involving salt, water, and acid-base balances, which are potentially expressed beyond a 30 min time period, and could secondarily affect respiration. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that blocking ANG II with iv saralasin would affect respiration and circulation over a 4-h period. Contrary to the hypothesis, iv infusion of saralasin in resting conscious eupneic dogs on a regular chow diet over a 4-h period had no effects on plasma strong ions, osmolality, acid-base balance, respiration, metabolism, or circulation when compared with similar control studies in the same animals. Thus, ANG II does not play a tonic modulatory role in respiratory control under \"normal\" physiological conditions.", 
    "273": "We investigated the respiratory and metabolic effects of decreased osmolality, and the potential roles of angiotensin II (ANG II) and the subfornical organ (SFO) in mediating these effects, in conscious Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Gastric water loading was induced either by oral gavage or an externalized indwelling stomach tube (20 mL x kg(-1) distilled water at body temperature). Repeated measurements after oral gavage were obtained with and without water loading and with and without ANG II receptor block (saralasin, 1.3 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) iv). At 15 min after water loading by oral gavage, ventilation (V, 1.14+/-0.08 L x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and tidal volume (10.7+/-0.6 mL x kg(-1)) were transiently higher (P < 0.05), at a time when plasma osmolality was decreased (-8+/-1 mOsm), compared with gavage tube alone (0.95+/-0.08 L x kg(-1) min(-1) and 9.1+/-0.7 mL x kg(-1), respectively). However, water loading via stomach tube did not stimulate V; only during the 60-s period of water infusion did V increase briefly, but this was due to increased respiratory frequency. Dye indicators demonstrated that oral gavage exposes upper airway and esophageal afferents to water, presumably accounting for respiratory stimulation. Lesions of the SFO did not affect respiration or metabolism. A decrease in osmolality, associated with both water loading techniques, caused a sustained increase in oxygen consumption (Vo2 ) and a decrease in the V/Vo2 ratio. ANG II receptor block reduced the Vo2 response and prevented the decrease in V/Vo2 following water loading by oral gavage, but did not affect the transient stimulation of V. Unlike larger mammals, decreased osmolality does not stimulate respiration in the SD rat.",

The average starting dosage of spironolactone was 55 mg. 143 patients (58.8%) discontinued spironolactone therapy before the end of follow-up. 98 patients (40.8%) discontinued within 6 months of follow-up. Of the 137 patients (56.4%) who did use spironolactone and an ACE-inhibitor concomitantly, only 45 (32.8%) continued this combination until the end of follow-up. The remainder of the patients discontinued either the ACE-inhibitor (10.9%) or spironolactone (12.4%) or both (43.8%).",

It is not certain whether these findings from past spironolactone use can be extrapolated to future use. Patients in the general population received higher average spironolactone dosages compared to the RALES study (55 mg vs. 26 mg), possibly resulting in more adverse effects and partly explaining the high discontinuation rate.", 
    "278": "Recent studies have suggested a proangiogenic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. We hypothesized that such a proangiogenic effect of ACE inhibition may be mediated, in part, by bradykinin (BK) B(2)-receptor pathway. This study therefore examined the neovascularization induced by ACE inhibitor treatment in B(2) receptor-deficient mice (B(2)(-/-)) in a model of surgically induced hindlimb ischemia. After artery femoral occlusion, wild-type and B(2)(-/-) mice were treated with or without ACE inhibitor (perindopril, 3 mg/kg/d) for 28 days. Angiogenesis was then quantitated by microangiography, capillary density measurement, and laser Doppler perfusion imaging. The protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were determined by Western blot. In wild-type animals, vessel density and capillary number in the ischemic leg were raised by 1.8- and 1.4-fold, respectively, in mice treated with ACE inhibitor when compared with the nontreated animals (P<0.01). This corresponded to an improved ischemic/nonischemic leg perfusion ratio by 1.5-fold in ACE inhibitor-treated animals when compared with the untreated ones (0.87+/-0.07 versus 0.59+/-0.05, respectively, P<0.01). Activation of the angiogenic process was also associated with a 1.7-fold increase in tissue eNOS protein level in mice treated with ACE inhibitor (P<0.05 versus control) but not with changes in VEGF protein level. Conversely, ACE inhibition did not affect vessel density, blood flow, and eNOS protein level in ischemic hindlimb of B(2)(-/-) mice. Therefore, proangiogenic effect of ACE inhibition is mediated by B(2)-receptor signaling and was associated with upregulation of eNOS content, independently of VEGF expression.",

This study will examine the hypotheses that lowering blood pressure with an ACE inhibitor-diuretic combination and intensively controlling gylcaemia with a sulphonylurea-based regimen in high-risk patients with Type II diabetes (both hypertensive and non-hypertensive) reduces the incidence of macrovascular and microvascular disease.",

Quantitatively, the change of score of mental health, general function and total QOL of captopril (3.18 +/- 5.90; 1.65 +/- 4.43; 7.84 +/- 11.03) were significantly higher than those of placebo (1.32 +/- 5.13, P = 0.00004; 0.64 +/- 3.45, P = 0.0008; 4.19 +/- 10.33, P = 0.0025 respectively), and the change of score of physical health domain (3.01 +/- 5.26 vs 2.23 +/- 4.79, P = 0.044) was of borderline statistical significant difference. Blood pressure was significantly lowered by captopril than by placebo (P = 0.000).",

However, there have been few reports regarding the influence of chronic exercise on the progression of renal disease. Similarly, there are few animal models concerned with the effect of exercise training on improving renal function. Therefore, we assessed the renal effects of moderate chronic treadmill exercise in a remnant kidney model of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with chronic renal failure. We also assessed the effects of exercise and antihypertensive therapy on renal function.", 
    "315": "Eight-week-old SHR were subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy by removal of the left kidney and excision of two-thirds of the right kidney. The rats were divided into four groups: (i) no exercise (Non-EX); (ii) moderate exercise with treadmill running (20 m/min, 0 grade incline for 60 min) (EX); (iii) EX with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril (2 mg/kg per day, i.p.); and (iv) EX with an angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan (5 mg/kg per day, i.p.), for 4 weeks.",

Both enalapril and losartan with EX significantly decreased blood pressure (P < 0.001), and further decreased the IGS. In the stepwise multiple regression analysis, only antihypertensive drug remained in the model as a significant predictor of IGS (P < 0.0001). In contrast, exercise, antihypertensive drug and mean systolic blood pressure (weeks 1-4) remained in the model as a significant predictors of mean proteinuria (weeks 1-4) (all P < 0.0001).",

All of them were hypertensive and had a 25% or at least 0.5 mg/dl increase in the value of serum creatinine during the 24 months prior to entering the study. Initial doses of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS were 10 and 30 mg respectively, and titration to 30 and 60 mg was performed if needed to obtain the expected blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mmHg). Furosemide, atenolol, and doxazosin were added as second, third, and fourth drugs if necessary, for blood pressure control. The primary end-point of the study was the appearance of double the serum creatinine values and/or the need to enter a dialysis programme. Secondary end-points were cardiovascular events, death, changes in 24 h proteinuria, and the evolution of serum creatinine. Data reflect the analysis performed by intention to treat.",

Renal survival was significantly better when fosinopril constituted the first step therapy (P = 0.002). These results did not seem to be influenced by the type of primary renal disease. Proteinuria decreased at the end of the study by a mean of 57% in the fosinopril group and increased by 7% in the group receiving dihydropiridine.

After pulse-labelling with [14C]-proline, the cultures were incubated further with the test compounds in different concentrations for a 180 min chase period. The reaction was stopped and radioactive collagenous peptides were analysed by gel electrophoresis. The amounts of collagenous proalpha and alpha chains were estimated, and the inhibition of procollagen to collagen conversion was calculated relative to 0 min control (100% inhibition) and 180 min control (0% inhibition) samples.",

Both compounds seemed to inhibit the conversion in clearly lower concentrations in tendon cultures, 4 mmol/l and 7 mmol/l, respectively, were sufficient for 50% inhibition. Angiotensin I, II, saralasin and bradykinin did not have any effect on conversion at 3.5, 9, 2 and 4 mmol/l concentrations, respectively.", 
    "325": "The peptidase inhibitors captopril and enalapril are able to inhibit the conversion of procollagen to collagen, which is a proteolytic process, possibly by inhibiting the specific procollagen proteases. Whether this phenomenon is involved in the antifibrotic property of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors warrants further study, as does the question of whether new antifibrotic agents could be developed on this basis.", 
    "326": "It has been shown that a diminished sympathetic activity contributes to the hypotensive and cardioprotective actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEI). Besides an inhibition of central sympathetic tone and peripheral noradrenaline release, we hypothesized that the interactions of ACEI with the sympathetic system may include a modulation of neuronal catecholamine uptake by peripheral nerves.",

Treatment (14 days) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with fosinopril (20 mg/kg per day) enhanced the cardiac uptake of i.v. administered [3H]-noradrenaline by 28%. The endogenous left ventricular content of noradrenaline was increased by 49% after an antihypertensive treatment of SHR with fosinopril (20 mg/kg per day). Identical increases in cardiac noradrenaline stores (53%) were observed in SHR treated with a blood pressure ineffective dose of fosinopril (0.2 mg/kg per day). The myocardial content of adrenaline was increased in parallel to noradrenaline after both dose regimes.", 
    "329": "It is concluded that ACEI increases neuronal uptake of catecholamines in SHR in a blood pressure-independent manner. This effect occurs acutely and is independent of central sympathetic activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that ACEI modulate the activity of the cardiac noradrenaline transporter by direct activation. The improved uptake of noradrenaline may contribute to the antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects of ACEI.", 
    "330": "The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study showed that when antihypertensive treatment reduces diastolic blood pressure well below 90 mmHg, there can be a further reduction of cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, with no evidence of a J-shaped curve at lower pressures. Office measurement, however, gives no information about blood pressure outside the office. This paper describes a HOT substudy in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.",

All received the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, while some also received an ACE-inhibitor, a beta-blocker or a diuretic. Average 24 h, day and night ambulatory blood pressure values were computed at baseline (n = 277) and during treatment (n = 347): 112 patients had been randomized to a target office diastolic blood pressure <or= 90 mmHg, 117 to <or= 85 mmHg and 118 to <or= 80 mmHg. Additional analyses included computation of: (1) trough-to-peak ratio and (2) the smoothness index (the ratio between the average of the 24 hourly blood pressure reductions after treatment and its standard deviation).", 
    "332": "Taking the subgroup as a whole, baseline 24 h average blood pressures (146 +/- 18/90 +/- 10 mmHg) were significantly and markedly lower than office blood pressures (170 +/- 14/105 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.01). Office, 24 h, day and night blood pressures were all significantly reduced by treatment, but there was a smaller fall in ambulatory, than in office pressures. The between group differences in office blood pressure were smaller than those observed in the overall HOT sample. Between-group differences in 24 h blood pressure were even smaller. Trough-to-peak ratios and smoothness indices were lowest in the highest blood pressure target group and highest in the lowest blood pressure target group. Office and ambulatory blood pressures were similar in the groups randomized to placebo (n = 170) or acetylsalicylic acid (n = 177).",

    "334": "Treatment strategies for chronic heart failure in children have generally been extrapolated from studies in adults with heart failure. This presentation reviews the existing knowledge and recommendations regarding the treatment of chronic heart failure in adults and the information that is available in children. Medications currently recommended for use in adults include diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. These recommendations are based on results from large, randomized, multicenter trials. Anecdotal evidence suggests similar beneficial effects of these medications in children. The fact that the etiologies, pathophysiology, and physiologic consequences of heart failure in children often differ greatly from those in adults, however, justifies the development of prospective, randomized trials to evaluate these medications specifically in children. Findings from these types of studies will provide critical information for developing guidelines for the appropriate treatment of children with chronic heart failure.", 
    "335": "Disruption of any one of a large number of balanced systems that maintain cardiomyocyte structure and function can cause myocardial dysfunction. Such disruption can occur either in response to acute stresses such as cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamping of the aorta or because of more chronic stresses resulting from factors such as genetic abnormalities, infection, or chronic ischemia. Several currently available therapies such as beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and other agents affect cardiomyocytes in ways that are more far reaching than initially appreciated when these agents were first introduced into clinical practice. As our knowledge and understanding of myocardial dysfunction increases, particularly in the neonatal and pediatric patient, we will be able to further target interventions to highly specific perturbations of cellular function and individual genetic variability.", 
    "336": "Nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulates renal O(2) consumption. This mechanism is impaired in heart and kidney of dogs with heart failure (CHF). Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, increases eNOS expression in the endothelium. Therefore, we studied whether simvastatin treatment could restore the regulation of renal O(2) consumption by stimulators of NO production in dogs with CHF. Renal O(2) consumption was measured after stimulation of NO production with bradykinin, ramiprilat, or amlodipine or the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). Simvastatin delayed the time to euthanasia in dogs with CHF (35 +/- 1.0 vs. 29 +/- 1.2 days; P < 0.01). In normal dogs, bradykinin (10(-4) M), ramiprilat (10(-4) M), amlodipine (10(-5) M), and SNAP (10(-4) M) significantly reduced O(2) consumption in the renal cortex (-31.8 +/- 0.9, -30.3 +/- 1.1, -30.1 +/- 2.0, -46.9 +/- 1.0%) and renal medulla (-29.7 +/- 2.1, -33.0 +/- 2.7, -30.8 +/- 2.2, -46.8 +/- 1.1%). Responses to bradykinin, ramiprilat, and amlodipine were significantly attenuated in CHF but were partially or completely restored by simvastatin. Responses to SNAP were unaffected. These data demonstrate that treatment with simvastatin improves renal production of NO in CHF, restoring the normal regulation of renal O(2) consumption by NO.", 
    "337": "The present study was designed to analyze the chronic renal response to omapatrilat, a new vasopeptidase inhibitor, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To that end, the renal and blood pressure response to a 4-day salt loading protocol was analyzed and the respective chronic renal curves constructed.", 
    "338": "In non treated animals, and under normal sodium intake (around 2 mEq/day), mean arterial pressure (MAP), was significantly higher in the SHR as compared with the controls (WKY). After increasing salt intake (8 times normal), MAP did not change significantly in any group and the animals reached a normal sodium balance in four days. In a second group of animals, omapatrilat was given orally for 15 days at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day in the drinking water. In these omapatrilat-treated animals, and under normal sodium intake, MAP was significantly lower in both groups, although the antihypertensive effect was much greater in the SHR, so that the MAP of the SHR group was completely normalized and similar to the WKY-treated group. The subsequent elevation of sodium intake did not significantly elevate MAP in any group and the animals could manage the sodium excess as well as the non treated groups.", 
    "339": "These results indicate that chronic treatment with omapatrilat normalizes blood pressure in SHR without affecting adversely the renal ability to eliminate a sodium load. Chronic treatment with omapatrilat resets the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship of the SHR to a normal level, thus without altering the normal salt-independence of this arterial hypertension model.", 
    "340": "The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in cardiac remodelling was studied in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. The effects of captopril and spironolactone were compared. Isoproterenol treatment increased ventricular to body weight ratio (4.6 vs 3.7) and collagen area (22.6 vs 8.2%), and reduced systolic (89.93 vs 107.5 mm Hg) and diastolic (59.6 vs 70.8 mm Hg) pressure. In these animals, captopril decreased systolic (67.4 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure (31.9 mm Hg), whereas spironolactone regressed systolic pressure to control values (101.2 mm Hg). Captopril and spironolactone prevented cardiac hypertrophy (4.01 and 3.95). However, only spironolactone prevented myocardial fibrosis (11.3%).", 
    "341": "The cardiovascular system is regulated by hemodynamic and neurohumoral mechanisms. These regulatory systems play a key role in modulating cardiac function, vascular tone, and structure. Although neurohumoral systems are essential in vascular homeostasis, they become maladaptive in disease states such as hypertension, coronary disease, and heart failure. The clinical success of ACE inhibitors has led to efforts to block other humoral systems. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is an endothelial cell surface zinc metallopeptidase with similar structure and catalytic site. NEP is the major enzymatic pathway for degradation of natriuretic peptides, a secondary enzymatic pathway for degradation of kinins, and adrenomedullin. The natriuretic peptides can be viewed as endogenous inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system. Inhibition of NEP increases levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of myocardial cell origin, and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) of endothelial cell origin as well as bradykinin and adrenomedullin. By simultaneously inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and potentiating the natriuretic peptide and kinin systems, vasopeptidase inhibitors reduce vasoconstriction, enhance vasodilation, improve sodium/water balance, and, in turn, decrease peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure and improve local blood flow. Within the blood vessel wall, this leads to a reduction of vasoconstrictor and proliferative mediators such as angiotensin II and increased local levels of bradykinin (and, in turn, nitric oxide) and natriuretic peptides. Preliminary clinical experiences with vasopeptidase inhibitors are encouraging. Thus, the combined inhibition of ACE and neutral endopeptidase is a new and promising approach to treat patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis, or heart failure.",

We measured the venoconstrictor effect of each peptide given before and after a 6.25-mg oral dose of the ACE inhibitor captopril or matching placebo. Placebo or captopril was given in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Ang I induced a mean+/-SEM venoconstrictor response of 45+/-11%, 40+/-10%, 55+/-8%, and 4+/-4% before placebo, after placebo, before captopril, and after captopril, respectively. Hence, the response to Ang I was reproducible and was reduced significantly only after treatment with captopril (P=0.002). [Pro(11)(D)-Ala(12)] Ang I induced a mean venoconstrictor response of 42+/-9%, 49+/-9%, 48+/-10%, and 54+/-11% before placebo, after placebo, before captopril, and after captopril, respectively. Hence, captopril had no significant effect on the response to [Pro(11)(D)-Ala(12)] Ang I.", 
    "344": "We have demonstrated that [Pro(11)(D)-Ala(12)] Ang I is able to induce venoconstriction in humans in vivo. With this specific pharmacological probe, we have shown that a non-ACE pathway capable of generating Ang II exists in human veins in vivo and is potentially functionally important. This pathway is likely to involve the enzyme chymase.",

We investigated the possibility that a chronic nonproductive cough without other potential causes is associated with airway inflammation, and if this is so, what the relationship might be between this inflammation and the possible etiology of the cough.",

In the bronchial biopsies, the patients were divided into the following two subgroups: 21 patients who were infiltrated with eosinophils vs the healthy control group (median, 12.0 vs. 0.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; p < 0.01); and 4 patients who were infiltrated with lymphocytes vs the healthy control group (median, 84.5 vs. 22.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; p < 0.01). With the methacholine challenge test, 5 of the 21 eosinophil-infiltrated patients received diagnoses of cough-variant asthma, and the other 16 patients received diagnoses of eosinophilic bronchitis. In the lymphocyte-infiltrated group, all four patients received diagnoses of lymphocytic bronchitis.",

The causes of the chronic nonproductive cough were eosinophilic bronchitis, cough-variant asthma, and lymphocytic bronchitis.", 
    "349": "Approximately 25% of US adults have high blood pressure (BP). Selection of effective and safe antihypertensive therapy for these individuals is an important health-care priority. High BP can be treated with a wide range of antihypertensive agents from a number of different classes. These drugs may differ in their suitability for administration to different subpopulations of patients. Results from both clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril erbumine is safe and well tolerated in a wide range of patients with hypertension. Cough, the most common ACE inhibitor-associated side effect, is also the most common clinical adverse event reported for perindopril, but <2% of perindopril-treated patients discontinue therapy because of cough. Other adverse events often associated with ACE inhibitors, first-dose hypotension and hyperkalemia, appear to occur less often with perindopril than with other agents in this class. The favorable safety profile for perindopril extends to a wide range of patients, including the elderly and those with either heart failure or renal disease. Perindopril has no negative effects on lipids in patients with hyperlipidemia or on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it reduces proteinuria in patients with renal disease. Perindopril has no known clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Thus, perindopril is a safe BP-lowering agent with documented tolerability in a wide range of patients with hypertension.", 
    "350": "The primary aim in the medical treatment of hypertension is to lower blood pressure (BP). A wide variety of agents have proved effective for meeting this goal. However, an ideal agent for management of hypertensive patients must also meet a number of additional criteria. It should have a significant positive impact on conditions that are likely to be associated with elevated BP and that are known risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This article reviews effects of the long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril erbumine on hypertension-associated blood vessel and myocardial remodeling known to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Long-term treatment with perindopril improves arterial compliance and increases the media-lumen ratio of peripheral resistance vessels. These effects appear to be at least partially independent of BP lowering. Reversal of hypertension-associated vascular remodeling with perindopril should decrease afterload and reduce or reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Evaluation of patients who have received long-term perindopril therapy has shown this to be the case. This effect of perindopril on an important predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may also be partially independent of BP. The combination of treatment with such agents as perindopril and methods that permit early detection of vascular changes contributing to cardiovascular disease has the potential to markedly improve the prognosis for hypertensive patients and others at risk for development of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "351": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most common and lethal consequence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with a prevalence estimated between 1% and 10%, and very high associated mortality. Preventing the continued progression of established heart failure and improving the prognosis for patients with this disease is difficult, but angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality in patients with CHF. In a review of the worldwide literature of the efficacy and safety of perindopril erbumine for the treatment of patients with CHF, once-daily treatment with this ACE inhibitor was shown to be effective in patients with CHF of all severities. Its use is associated with a low risk of first-dose hypotension and no unwanted effects on blood pressure in normotensive patients. Perindopril also improves arterial compliance and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension. It is well tolerated and has no significant effects on heart rate, indexes of renal function, or plasma lipid profile. It also has no clinically significant interactions with other drugs, including digoxin, likely to be taken by patients with CHF.", 
    "352": "Perindopril erbumine is a once-daily angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that effectively lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Converted from the prodrug ester perindopril, the active diacid perindoprilat is distributed rapidly and extensively, primarily to tissues with high ACE activity. Its ability to lower BP is comparable to or better than that of other antihypertensive agents, both of its own class and other classes, and its trough-peak ratio is consistently between 75% and 100%, translating into 24 hours of true efficacy per dose. First-dose hypotension caused by an initial acute BP depression occurs less frequently with perindopril than with other ACE inhibitors, an advantage in volume-contracted patients and those whose BP is angiotensin II dependent, such as patients with congestive heart failure. A missed-dose study showed that most of the antihypertensive effect of perindopril remains for 24 to 48 hours after dosing, a characteristic that confers protection to patients who miss a dose. Perindopril improves the distensibility and compliance of large and small arteries, which are compromised in hypertension, and can effect vascular remodeling by a mechanism independent of BP lowering. The clinical implications of these effects are being investigated in large trials. Perindopril is well tolerated in the elderly, and combination therapy with a diuretic was shown to yield significant additional BP reduction. Perindoprilat is cleared renally; dosage should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment.", 
    "353": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril erbumine, has been approved for use in the United States only recently but has been studied extensively worldwide over the last decade. Placebo-controlled trials in a wide range of patients with hypertension, including the elderly, those with isolated systolic hypertension, and those with concomitant diseases such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, nephropathy with proteinuria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have shown that perindopril is highly effective in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). Studies in which BP has been monitored for 24-hour intervals show that perindopril (1) has a gradual onset of action, (2) provides smooth BP control over its once-daily dosing interval, (3) has a trough-peak ratio of about 1, and (4) maintains its antihypertensive efficacy despite missed doses. Perindopril increases arterial compliance and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. Both of these effects are at least partly independent of its ability to lower BP. Perindopril is safe and well tolerated in patients with hypertension. Rates of adverse events and discontinuation because of such events are low.", 
    "354": "It has not been clear whether immunosuppressive therapy favorably influences renal function and proteinuria in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) has an anti-proteinuric effect in IgAN. A retrospective study was done to see whether the addition of immunosuppressive therapy to ACEi produces a more excellent anti-proteinuric effect and preserves better renal function than ACEi alone.", 
    "355": "A total of 49 patients with proteinuria > 1.0 g/day and serum creatinine concentrations < 1.5 mg/dL were followed-up from at least 1 year to 9 years.

There was no significant elevation of serum creatinine in both groups during follow-up (the combination group: from 0.91 +/- 0.20 to 1.03 +/- 0.38 mg/dL, ACEi group: from 0.93 +/- 0.27 to 0.99 +/- 0.37 mg/dL). This study showed no significant differences in the change in slope of 1/serum creatinine levels during the follow-up period between the two groups.", 
    "357": "We conclude that immunosuppressive therapy may not be beneficial in patients with proteinuric IgAN. ACEi may be a valuable therapeutic agent avoiding serious side effects of immunosuppressive agents.", 
    "358": "Several strategies are available to delay progression of renal disease and the development of associated co-morbidities. Hypertension is a strong independent risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and there is consensus that blood pressure (BP) management is an important aspect of care in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Clinical studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have renoprotective properties, independent of their antihypertensive effects, which can delay the onset of ESRD. Studies have also shown that intensive therapy of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, to give near normal blood glucose concentrations, can reduce the incidence of progressive clinical proteinuria and may, therefore, protect against ESRD. Additionally, data are emerging that treatment of renal anaemia with epoetin can reduce mortality and delay the onset of dialysis in CRI patients, but these encouraging results need to be confirmed in large prospective studies. In conclusion, control of BP and hyperglycaemia, as well as use of ACE inhibitors and anaemia treatment, all have potential in delaying the progression of CRI or improving patient outcomes. If benefit is proven in future studies, these strategies will be most effective if implemented early in the course of CRI.", 
    "359": "The introduction of recombinant erythropoietin (Epo, epoetin) has resulted in a shift in focus from the treatment to the prevention of anaemia. This shift in treatment goals has provided nephrologists with the challenge of implementing preventative strategies in clinical practice. While this area of nephrology is still developing, a lot can be learned from the methods applied by clinicians involved in the prevention of other diseases, particularly non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus. The prevention of type 2 diabetes has become a major aim of healthcare providers globally due to the epidemic proportions of the disease. In order to reverse this worrying trend, diabetologists have had to develop effective management strategies based upon their current knowledge. Nephrologists must now adopt a similar approach if the increasing threat from diabetic nephropathy is to be reversed. This should include strict normotension, the prescribing of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, administration of lipid-lowering agents, and the near-normalization of anaemia with epoetin. However, the implementation of treatment strategies alone is unlikely to be sufficient. Indeed, an effective programme of education is required to ensure that patients understand the seriousness of their condition and remain compliant with treatment. Similarly, educating the general public may help to reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes and the subsequent problems associated with the disease, including renal disease.", 
    "360": "Blood pressure is a determinant of the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals with cerebrovascular disease. However, there is uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of blood-pressure-lowering treatments for many such patients. The perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) was designed to determine the effects of a blood-pressure-lowering regimen in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.", 
    "361": "6105 individuals from 172 centres in Asia, Australasia, and Europe were randomly assigned active treatment (n=3051) or placebo (n=3054). Active treatment comprised a flexible regimen based on the angiotensin- converting-enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of treating physicians. The primary outcome was total stroke (fatal or non-fatal). Analysis was by intention to treat.", 
    "362": "Over 4 years of follow up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg. 307 (10%) individuals assigned active treatment suffered a stroke, compared with 420 (14%) assigned placebo (relative risk reduction 28% [95% CI 17-38], p<0.0001). Active treatment also reduced the risk of total major vascular events (26% [16-34]). There were similar reductions in the risk of stroke in hypertensive and non-hypertensive subgroups (all p<0.01). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide reduced blood pressure by 12/5 mm Hg and stroke risk by 43% (30-54). Single-drug therapy reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg and produced no discernable reduction in the risk of stroke.", 
    "363": "This blood-pressure-lowering regimen reduced the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide produced larger blood pressure reductions and larger risk reductions than did single drug therapy with perindopril alone. Treatment with these two agents should now be considered routinely for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, irrespective of their blood pressure.", 
    "364": "Sublingual (SL) apomorphine (2 to 6 mg) has been shown to be effective for treatment of male erectile dysfunction. Many patients with erectile dysfunction are also being treated for systemic hypertension and/or cardiovascular disease. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, SL apomorphine 5 mg and placebo were administered on alternate days to 162 men who were on long-term therapy (> or =4 weeks) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, alpha(1) blockers, or short- or long-acting nitrates. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and after dosing; cardiac rhythm was recorded by 4-hour Holter monitoring. The only potentially clinically significant interactions between SL apomorphine and the antihypertensive agents or short-acting nitrates were greater orthostatic decreases in systolic blood pressure in the alpha-blocker and calcium channel blocker groups (-10 and -6 mm Hg vs placebo, respectively). Administration of SL apomorphine after dosing with long-acting nitrates resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure when patients were standing (mean systolic change, -5 to -9 mm Hg 30 to 60 minutes postdose, p <0.05; mean diastolic change, -3 to -4 mm Hg 50 to 60 minutes postdose, p <0.05). The most common adverse events with SL apomorphine were dizziness, nausea, and headache. Syncope occurred in 1 patient in the beta-blocker group; symptomatic hypotension occurred in 2 patients each in the short- and long-acting nitrate groups. Thus, in patients receiving common antihypertensive agents and short-acting nitrates, as well as in most patients receiving long-acting nitrates, SL apomorphine at higher than recommended doses produced no clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure greater than changes seen with SL apomorphine alone.",

    "368": "Preclinical and clinical studies of losartan have demonstrated consistent hemodynamic effects (via selective antagonism of the AII type 1 receptor) and a safety profile similar to that of placebo (presumably a reflection of the selective approach to AII blockade). In addition, large-scale end-point studies have shown losartan to have comparable efficacy to ACE inhibitors on a number of morbidity and mortality measures.",

Radioimmunoassay was used to determine plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum angiotensin I and aldesterone levels. There was higher RAAS activity, as shown by elevated PRA. RAAS activity decreased during CHF treatment with angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, ramipril, prestarium) and an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (cosaar), which is indicative of the efficiency of CHF treatment.", 
    "371": "The aim of the study was to assess prestarium effects on systolic and diastolic cardiac functions in 38 patients with ischemic heart disease and chronic cardiac failure (NYHA functional class II-IV) by biventricular balanced radioventriculography. Both left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction was found. A course of prestarium treatment caused different alterations in ventricular contractility. 64.2% patients of those who had right ventricular ejection fraction < 40% achieved an increase in right and left ventricular ejection fraction. Improved diastolic function of the myocardium was registered in 71% patients.", 
    "372": "This study evaluated the long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan on the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in T lymphocytes and plasma in patients with essential hypertension. The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. Nine patients with sitting blood pressure > or = 95 mm Hg and < or = 105 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week placebo run-in period entered the double-blind phase of the study, which consisted of three 6-week periods during which patients were treated with placebo, enalapril (20 mg, once daily), or losartan (50 mg, once daily) The angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in T lymphocytes was measured as the activity of the degradation of the substrate Hippuryl-His-Leu and as the appearance of the dipeptide His-Leu, which was quantified spectrofluorometrically. Enalapril but not losartan suppressed (p < or = 0.01) the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in plasma, whereas it stimulated (p < or = 0.05) the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in circulating T lymphocytes. Our data document induction of angiotensin-converting enzyme in human T lymphocytes during long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonism with losartan had no effect on plasma or lymphocytic angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "373": "Effects of antihypertensive treatment on large arteries may be influenced by the type of drug and concomitant risk factors such as blood cholesterol. To explore these possibilities we investigated the common carotid artery of 20 subjects with low cholesterol and 19 subjects with high cholesterol, all with essential hypertension, randomly allocated to 3 months of treatment with nitrendipine (20 mg/d) or trandolapril (2 mg/d). Carotid parameters were determined by recording instantaneous pressure (applanation tonometry) and diameter (echotracking device) and by modeling the pressure-diameter loop to obtain the Peterson modulus, stiffness index, measured and isobaric compliances, and wall viscosity. Effects of drugs on carotid parameters did not differ, except on systolic and diastolic diameters (p < 0.01), which increased insignificantly under nitrendipine but decreased (p < 0.01) under trandolapril. Blood cholesterol status did not influence carotid effects of trandolapril, whereas patients with low and high cholesterol treated with nitrendipine exhibited significant differences in drug effects on (a) systolic and pulse pressures (p < 0.05), which decreased in patients with low cholesterol (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) but not in those with high cholesterol; (b) diastolic diameter (p = 0.05), which increased insignificantly in patients with low cholesterol but was unchanged in those with high cholesterol; and (c) wall viscosity (p < 0.01), which decreased in patients with low cholesterol (p < 0.05) but increased insignificantly in those with high cholesterol. Also, wall viscosity change under nitrendipine was positively related to the baseline blood cholesterol ( r = 0.64, p < 0.01). Thus, nitrendipine and trandolapril show noteworthy differences in their effects on the carotid artery, in particular with respect to the status of blood cholesterol, but these differences should be confirmed by larger studies.", 
    "374": "Effective control of blood pressure is usually achieved only with the use of two or more antihypertensive medications. The treatment options for hypertension are numerous, and the number of possible combinations large. The selection of a specific combination drug regimen has often been linked to the perceived need for diuretic therapy as first- or second-step therapy; thus, the popularity of such drug combinations as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/diuretic, an angiotensin-receptor blocker/diuretic, or a beta blocker/diuretic. Rational alternatives exist, including an ACE inhibitor/calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a dihydropyridine CCB/b blocker combination. Traditionally, recommendations have advised against the use of combination therapy with two drugs from the same therapeutic class. However, because of the different binding and pharmacologic characteristics of CCBs, a rationale exists for combining different agents in this class in the management of hypertension and/or symptomatic coronary artery disease. In the treatment of either hypertension or angina, combination CCB therapy can prove uniquely successful.", 
    "375": "The preferred initial agents for the treatment of high blood pressure are low-dose thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In high-risk patients, including those with diabetes, renal insufficiency, left ventricular dysfunction, and atherosclerosis, ACE inhibitors may have specific benefit in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Omapatrilat, the prototypical vasopeptidase inhibitor, inhibits not only ACE but also neutral endopeptidase. Like conventional ACE inhibitors, omapatrilat causes extracellular volume reduction and vasodilatation; moreover, it increases levels of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides and bradykinin. Effective blood pressure control, especially in the high-risk patient, usually necessitates combination therapy. A recent study randomized 274 subjects with mild to severe hypertension (stages 1-3 diastolic blood pressure elevation) and confirmed the benefits of omapatrilat combined with hydrochlorothiazide in patients not controlled on hydrochlorothiazide alone. The frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuation attributed to adverse events were similar for omapatrilat and placebo. Furthermore, there were no clinically significant changes in serum creatinine, potassium, or other laboratory parameters. Adding omapatrilat to the background of hydrochlorothiazide treatment produced statistically significant additional reductions in trough diastolic and systolic blood pressures at weeks 4 and 8.", 
    "376": "Combination therapy is required in many patients to achieve goal blood pressure (BP). Calcium antagonists are highly effective antihypertensive drugs in a broad range of demographic groups. Yet, higher doses are associated with an increased frequency of lower extremity edema. The purpose of our open label, single-center clinical trial was to evaluate the use of concomitant pharmacologic therapies to attenuate the lower extremity edema associated with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists therapy using a water displacement technique. Forty-seven patients received 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine for a period of 6 weeks after a 4-week wash-out off of all antihypertensive medications to establish baseline BP. They were then randomized to receive either an additional 5 mg of amlodipine, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), or 20 mg of benazepril for an additional 6 weeks. Blood pressure determinations and water displacement measurements were obtained at the end of the 4-week placebo wash-out period, after 6 weeks of 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine therapy, and after an additional 6 weeks of 5 mg of amlodipine and randomized drug therapy. Adjusted BP reductions (based on pretreatment BP) were -6.8/-3.8 mm Hg for the 10-mg amlodipine group, -9.9/-8.2 mm Hg for the amlodipine (5 mg)/HCTZ (25 mg) group, and -26.2/-16.4 mm Hg for the amlodipine (5 mg)/benazepril (20 mg) group (P < .0167, group 3 v group 1 diastolic BP, which was statistically significant by the improved Bonferroni method). Seventeen of the 47 patients developed at least a 10% increase in lower extremity edema water displacement in response to 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine therapy (36.2%). Adding 5 mg of amlodipine to a baseline of 5 mg of amlodipine resulted in no net change in lower extremity edema (+58.0 mL,+ 0.6% change, n=5). Adding 25 mg of HCTZ reduced lower extremity edema by a mean of 136.3 mL (-11.1% change, n=4). Benazepril reduced water displacement by 204.4 mL (-14.3% change, n=8). Our pilot study indicates that adding an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is the most effective way to not only reduce systolic and diastolic BP but also attenuate lower extremity edema. Due to the inherent daily variability of lower extremity edema, power calculations indicate many patients (n=702, 356 in each group) would be needed to compare the antiedema efficacy of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and the thiazide diuretic.", 
    "377": "Older studies of antihypertensive treatment have shown that prescribing patterns are not consistent with recommendations from expert national panels. We determined whether prescribing patterns for antihypertensive drugs changed recently in the largest integrated health care system in the United States. Specifically, we determine 1) patterns of antihypertensive medication use at all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities for fiscal years 1997 to 1999, 2) the cost of this care, and 3) savings associated with changes in treatment patterns. Data were aggregated by individual medication as well as by antihypertensive drug class. Estimates of VA national antihypertensive drug costs are based on the median cost and the number of units for each dosage form of each medication dispensed at all facilities. At VA medical facilities, calcium antagonist use went from 33% to 29.3% of antihypertensive treatment days between 1997 and 1999, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use from 36.4% to 36.8%, beta-blockers from 19.1% to 21.1%, and thiazide diuretic use from at 11.5% to 12.8%. If treatment patterns had remained the same between 1997 and 1999 in terms of the proportion of medications from each drug class, an additional six million dollars would have been spent on antihypertensive medications in 1999. Although calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors/ARB remained the most commonly dispensed antihypertensives at VA facilities from 1997 to 1999, there was a proportional decrease in calcium antagonist use and an increase in the use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers. These changes were consistent with improved compliance with VA national guidelines. The cost implications of these changes in practice patterns were considerable.", 
    "378": "Pharmacologic treatment patterns for hypertensive American Indians from 13 communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and North Dakota were assessed. Participants (2254 women and 1384 men, aged 48 to 79 years) completed a clinical examination between July 1993 and December 1995. The mean of two blood pressure (BP) measurements and detailed medication histories were obtained. The observed prevalence of hypertension was 46.7% (n=1698). In participants taking antihypertensive medications (n=1114), four principal drug classes were evaluated: diuretics, calcium channel blocking agents, beta-blocking agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Among treated hypertensive participants, 71.4%, 24.6%, and 4.0% received one, two, and three medications, respectively. Among single drug regimens, ACE inhibitors (n=340) were used most often (49.4%), with calcium channel blocking agents and diuretics accounting for 24.2% and 19.9%, respectively. Although multiple drug class therapies varied, the combination of a diuretic and ACE inhibitor (n=120) accounted for 47.4% of dual therapy use. Hypertension control (SBP < 140 mm Hg, DBP < 90 mm Hg) rates were highest for those on dual therapies (65.4%), followed by participants on single (53.8%) and triple (43.6%) therapies. Among monotherapies, diuretics exhibited the best overall hypertension control rate in both diabetics (63.0%) and nondiabetics (68.0%), versus 47% to 61% for other remaining agents. The frequent use of ACE inhibitors, used singly or in combination, reflects the high prevalence of diabetes among American Indians. ACE inhibitors, combined with diuretics, were particularly useful in achieving BP control in this population.", 
    "379": "Most patients with low renin essential hypertension are not qualitatively different from patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, as in both conditions aldosterone secretion is not appropriately reduced. The aim of the study was to investigate allele and genotype frequencies of the -344C/T polymorphism, located in the promoter region of the aldosterone synthase gene, in 83 patients with idiopathic low renin hypertension characterized by an increased aldosterone to renin ratio, including both patients with low renin essential hypertension (n=53) and subjects with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (n=30), compared with 78 patients with normal to high renin essential hypertension and 126 normotensive control subjects. The relationship of -344C/T genotypes to basal and postcaptopril plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio was also examined in the entire hypertensive population. An increased frequency of the T allele and a relative excess of TT homozygosity over CC homozygosity were found in patients with idiopathic low renin hypertension in comparison with both normal to high renin hypertensives and normotensive controls. A higher post-captopril aldosterone to renin ratio was found in the hypertensives with TT genotype than in those with CC genotype, and TT+TC genotypes were associated with a smaller decrease in the aldosterone-to-renin ratio elicited by captopril administration. The present study suggests that the -344C/T polymorphism, or a functional variant in linkage disequilibrium with it, may play a role in the abnormal regulation of aldosterone secretion in idiopathic low renin hypertension.", 
    "380": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of trandolapril and losartan on plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) levels and insulin sensitivity in hypertensive postmenopausal women. We studied 89 hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure >90 and <110 mm Hg) postmenopausal women, aged 51 to 60 years not taking any hormone replacement therapy. Diabetic, obese, and smoking patients were excluded. After a 4-week placebo period, they were randomized to receive 2 mg of oral trandolapril (n=45) or 50 mg of oral losartan (n=44) for 12 weeks according to a double-blind, parallel group design. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, blood pressure (BP) was measured, plasma samples were drawn to evaluate PAI-1 antigen levels, and insulin sensitivity was assessed. Both trandolapril and losartan reduced systolic BP (by a mean of 16.9 mm Hg and 15.2 mm Hg, respectively, P < .01 v placebo) and diastolic BP (by a mean of 13.1 mm Hg and 11.9 mm Hg, respectively, P < .01 v placebo) with no difference between the two treatments. The PAI-1 antigen levels were significantly decreased by trandolapril (from 36.9+/-21 ng/dL to 27.2+/-17 ng/dL, P < .05), but not by losartan (from 35.3+/-22 ng/dL to 37.1+/-23 ng/dL, P=not significant). Glucose infusion rate was significantly increased by trandolapril (from 6.67+/-0.56 mg/min/kg to 7.9+/-0.65 mg/min/kg, P < .05), but was not significantly modified by losartan (from 6.7+/-0.47 mg/min/kg to 6.9+/-0.50 mg/min/kg, P= not significant). In the trandolapril group the PAI-1 decrease correlated with glucose infusion rate increase (r=0.36, P=.045) These results provide evidence of different effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 antagonists on fibrinolysis and suggest that the PAI-1 decrease induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is related to their action on insulin sensitivity and is not dependent on angiotensin II antagonism but rather on other mechanisms. It remains to be seen whether these findings apply to other patient populations than postmenopausal women.", 
    "381": "Cardiac hypertrophy is common in hypertension but its development is influenced by angiotensin II, sodium intake aldosterone, and the time of day blood pressure (BP) is elevated. This study examined and compared cardiac hypertrophy in the 2 kidney-1 clip (2K-1C) and 1 kidney-clip (1K-1C) Goldblatt models of hypertension. Blood pressure was measured by telemetry in a selected group of rats. Rats were placed on a high (4%) or reduced (0.2%) salt intake and were given captopril (75 mg/kg per day) or losartan (10 mg/kg per day). Appropriate sham-operated and untreated controls were used. Cardiac hypertrophy was greater in the IK-1C than in the 2K-1C model. Day and sleep BP were also higher. In the 2K-1C model BP was lower on the reduced salt intake and BP decreased with captopril in both reduced and high salt groups. Cardiac weight and index decreased significantly only in the reduced salt and captopril group and was less than the size before treatment. In the 1K-1C model captopril caused all BP measures to decrease in the reduced salt group but had no significant effect in the high salt group. Cardiac weight and index were reduced only in the reduced salt + captopril group and cardiac weight was less than the pretreatment control. Losartan had a similar effect in the lK-1C model to that achieved with captopril. The responses achieved correlated in part with renin status and dependency level. There is no prime determinant of cardiac hypertrophy. Blood pressure, sodium intake, and hormonal status are all important. It is postulated that the common pathway may be alterations in cell composition that signal the nucleus to increase cell growth.", 
    "382": "Renovascular hypertension and renal outlet obstruction are two clinical conditions well evaluated by nuclear medicine techniques. They both require a specific intervention to challenge a specific aspect of renal functional reserve. Diuretic renography is the oldest common example in nuclear medicine where functional change in the kidney is provoked for diagnostic purposes. The kidney's tubular functional reserve, in this instance, is challenged to induce diuresis and increase urine flow. This intervention permits diuretic renography to retain an essential role in the evaluation of hydroureteronephrosis. Captopril renography is a more recent example of a similar principle and depends on a reactive renin-angiotensin system to identify a kidney responsible for RVH. In both renal outlet obstruction and RVH, an anatomic abnormality is also identified (hydronephrosis and RAS, respectively) at some point in the diagnostic workup. The final diagnosis in each instance, however, depends on evidence for a functional disorder, provoked and measured during the radionuclide interventional examination. These serve as excellent examples of the power of functional imaging to identify specific medical disorders.", 
    "383": "The purpose of this study was to calculate the improvement in life expectancy by treating patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction with an ACE inhibitor. Life expectancy was estimated as median lifetime and follow up in the TRACE study was prolonged until median lifetime could be calculated in both treatment groups. Median lifetime was reached in the placebo group after 4.6 years. In the trandolapril group median lifetime was increased by 15.3 months or 27% (7-51%). We conclude that the increase in lifetime by treatment of patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction is substantial.", 
    "384": "The high incidence of hypertension after renal transplantation contributes to the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. Although cyclosporine has been influential in the improvement of transplant outcome, it has emerged as a major cause of hypertension after organ transplantation. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of cyclosporine-induced hypertension include enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity, renal vasoconstriction, and sodium/water retention. Hypertension is also significantly associated with reduced graft survival and thereby requires aggressive treatment intervention. Calcium channel blockers may offer some advantages over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in stable renal transplant recipients. Nevertheless, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive agent should take into account the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions with immunosuppressive agents. There is evidence to suggest that the use of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression induces less hypertension compared with cyclosporine. Not only do patients receiving tacrolimus tend to require less antihypertensive therapy, but converting patients from cyclosporine to tacrolimus has been shown to result in significant reductions in blood pressure. Thus, tacrolimus may be associated with an improved cardiovascular risk profile in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "385": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is frequently activated in patients with chronic liver diseases. Angiotensin-II (AT-II) has been suggested to play an important role in liver fibrogenesis. It induces hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation and up-regulates the transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) expression via AT-II type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) in vitro. The aim of the present study was to examine the in vivo effect of candesartan (CA), a clinically used AT(1)-R blocker (ARB), and perindopril (PE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I), on pig serum-induced liver fibrosis development in rats. The clinically available comparable doses of CA and PE significantly attenuated the fibrosis development. These inhibitory effects of PE and CA were also found in the on-going liver fibrosis model. The hepatic hydroxyproline and serum fibrosis markers were significantly suppressed by CA and PE treatment. Furthermore, the alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) positive cells in number were markedly suppressed by CA and PE treatment. Similarly, the hepatic TGF-beta(1) protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly suppressed. Our in vitro study showed that AT-II increased the TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression in the activated HSCs, and this effect was totally blocked by CA. These results suggested that the RAS, especially AT-II and AT(1)-R interaction plays a pivotal role in liver fibrosis development through HSC activation. Because both CA and PE are widely used in clinical practice without serious side effects, these drugs may provide an effective new strategy for anti-liver fibrosis therapy.", 
    "386": "Despite a progressive reduction in acute myocardial infarction mortality over the years, death related to ventricular free wall rupture has not changed. This is mostly related to the catastrophic presentation and death within minutes in the majority of these patients. Once rupture is suspected, bedside echocardiography should be performed immediately, followed by pericardiocentesis and repair of the rupture site as quickly as possible. Measures to prevent cardiac rupture include the administration of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless contraindications exist, and the avoidance of steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen and indomethacin.",

Enalapril was administered orally as a novel extemporaneous suspension in children younger than 6 years of age and as tablets in older children. First-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics were estimated in children ages 1 to 24 months, 25 months to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 16 years. Maximum serum concentrations for enalapril occurred approximately 1 hour after administration. Serum concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, peaked between 4 and 6 hours after the first dose and 3 and 4 hours after multiple doses. The area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), adjusted for body surface area, did not differ between age groups. Based on comparison of first-dose and steady-state AUCs, the accumulation of enalaprilat in children ranged from 1.13- to 1.45-fold. For children ages 2 to 15 years, mean urinary recovery of total enalaprilat ranged from 58.3% in children ages 6 to < 12 years to 71.4% in children ages 12 to < 16 years. Urinary recovery for children ages 2 to < 6 years was 66.8%. The mean percentage conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat ranged from 64.7% for children ages 1 to 24 months to 74.6% for children ages 6 to < 12 years. The median effective half-life for accumulation ranged from 14.6 hours in children ages 12 to < 16 years to 16.3 hours in children ages 6 to < 12 years. There were two serious adverse events, neither of which was attributed to enalapril or resulted in discontinuation of the study drug.

In an observational study we assessed the frequency of this adverse effect in patients aged over 75 years receiving these drugs in combination. In one year, out of 1500 patients whose records were screened, 12 were prescribed this combination. 2 developed acute renal failure, of whom one died and the other recovered after discontinuation of both drugs. 4 patients showed deterioration in renal function, which returned to normal after one of the drugs was stopped. Renal function remained stable in 6 patients: patients with deterioration in renal function were older and more likely to be on diuretics. This drug combination is commonly nephrotoxic in the elderly and should be avoided, especially in those taking diuretics.",

Advances in these areas have created controversies regarding who should be screened and treated for primary or secondary prevention of coronary events. The advent of the statin class of lipid-lowering agents represented a major advance, because they are much more effective and better tolerated than previous agents. There is general agreement that patients with hypercholesterolemia and established CHD require treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent coronary events. Primary prevention is controversial in all patient groups except those with diabetes, because their risk of developing CHD is dramatically increased. Postmenopausal women and the elderly are undertreated, whereas young adults may be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Several ongoing trials may resolve the controversies about which patient groups will benefit from different prevention and treatment strategies.",

ECGs were recorded at baseline and at study end. We compared prevention/regression and development/persistence of ECG-LVH in the two groups and related these changes to outcomes. At baseline, 676 patients had LVH (321 in the ramipril group and 355 in the placebo group) and 7605 patients did not have LVH (3814 in the ramipril group and 3791 in the placebo group). By study end, 336 patients in the ramipril group (8.1%) compared with 406 in the placebo group (9.8%) had development/persistence of LVH; in contrast, 3799 patients in the ramipril group (91.9%) compared with 3740 in the placebo group (90.2%) had regression/prevention of LVH (P=0.007). The effect of ramipril on LVH was independent of blood pressure changes. Patients who had regression/prevention of LVH had a lower risk of the predefined primary outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) compared with those who had development/persistence of LVH (12.3% versus 15.8%, P=0.006) and of congestive heart failure (9.3% versus 15.4%, P<0.0001).",

    "418": "Diabetes mellitus carries a great burden on healthcare costs due to its growing population and high co-morbidity. This adverse effect sustains even when patients develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We here present data showing the effect of diabetes on economic costs in dialysis therapy in Taiwan. As of the end of 1997, we have 22,027 ESRD patients with a prevalence and incidence rate of 1013 and 253 per million populations, respectively. Diabetic nephropathy is the second most common cause of the underlying renal diseases, but accounts for 24.8% of the prevalent patients and 35.9% of the incident cases. The diabetic patients engendered 11.8% more expense for care of dialysis than the non-diabetic patients (US $26,988 vs. US $24,146 per patient-year). Higher inpatient cost mainly account for the difference. As compared to non-diabetic patients, the diabetic patients had 3.5 times more inpatients costs (US $1325 vs. US $4677 per patient-year), and higher proportion of inpatient-to-annualized cost ratio (5.5 vs. 17.3%) resulting from their more frequent hospitalization (0.59 vs. 1.13 times per patient-year) and longer hospital stay (6.7 vs. 18.9 days per patient-year). The major causes responsible for a more frequent hospitalization were cardiovascular disease, poorly controlled hyperglycemia, sepsis and failure of vascular access. The annualized costs for care of dialysis patients in Taiwan, including inpatient and outpatient costs, averaged US $25,576 per patient-year. This value is approximately half of that in most of the western countries and Japan. Thus, a more cost-effective way to achieve savings is to reduce the high incidence rate of dialysis population and to maximize the quality of dialysis treatment for avoiding hospitalization. Recent studies had shown that tight blood pressure control, intensive glycemic control, and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in diabetic patients significantly reduced not only the rate of progressive renal failure, but also substantially reduced the cost of complications and led to higher cost effectiveness. Once diabetic patients reach stage of ESRD, an optimized pre-ESRD care and consideration of kidney transplantation are essential in terms of better patient survival and cost savings.", 
    "419": "When angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition first became available to block the renin system, few could have predicted the evolution that would occur in this field. The advent of angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT(1)) blockers has created new opportunities. These agents, including eprosartan, are extraordinarily well tolerated, not only when compared with antihypertensive agents but also in comparison with the ACE inhibitors, which are rather well tolerated. The AT(1) blocker class is growing rapidly, at least in part because many believe that these drugs will share with the ACE inhibitors the special ability to reduce morbidity and mortality. Does eprosartan have a special role within this class? Eprosartan differs structurally from the other AT(1) blockers in that it is not a biphenyl tetrazole. It differs functionally in vitro in being a pure competitive antagonist, as opposed to the nonequilibrium, insurmountable characteristics of the other blockers. This feature may prove to be useful for titration in the fragile patient. The reduction in catecholamine release induced by eprosartan that has been observed in animal models may account for some special examples of increased efficacy. One such example pertains to the difference in the dose-response relationship for the action of eprosartan on the renal blood supply in comparison with other AT(1) blockers. Eprosartan doses well below those required for control of blood pressure have a pronounced effect on the kidney. If research already under way supports these early suggestions, then eprosartan will be an important addition to our therapeutic armamentarium.", 
    "420": "QT dispersion reflects in homogenecity of ventricular repolarization. It is calculated using 12-leads standard synchronized ECG or 24-hours Holter monitoring. The most common used indicators are: QT dispersion (QTd), based on Bazett's formula corrected for heart rate QT dispersion (QTcd) and QT dispersion ratio (QTdR). QT apex and QTd corrected for total number of leads ECG in which QT interval was counted are rare used. Increased QT dispersion is observed among others: following myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CAD), hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF), long QT syndrome, as well as diabetes. Following mentioned diseases increased QT dispersion has prognostic value for sustained ventricular tachycardia. Dispersion of repolarization > or = 80 ms after MI is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Following acute MI decrease of QT dispersion after successful thrombolytic therapy is observed and its value > or = 100 ms is regarded as a marker of reperfusion insufficiency. QT dispersion in patients with CAD correlates with extent of ischemia and decreases after coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In recent years beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenolytic therapy on QT dispersion was described. Actually the improvement of computerised methods in assessment of QT dispersion is observed, but it require further investigations.",

No significant differences were observed between group 1 and group 2 and between group 2 and group 3.",

Each drug caused similar reductions in left ventricular mass, chamber sphericity, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during monotherapy and combined treatment. Adjunctive treatment with carvedilol produced a trend toward a greater increase in ejection fraction (4.3% vs 2.7%, respectively; P not significant) and significantly greater reductions in the wall thickening score index than with captopril (0.25 vs 0.08, respectively; P =.04).",

In the RESOLVD study, the 6MWT was not responsive to change when effect sizes and standardized response means were used. Disease-specific quality of life was responsive to change in patients treated with candesartan and enalapril and NYHA-FC was responsive to change in the candesartan and enalapril combination and for enalapril alone with small effect sizes. The 6MWT, NYHA-FC, and quality of life were not responsive to change during the metoprolol or placebo phase.",

There was a marked increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and thrombolytic therapy between 1986 and 1997. The use of calcium antagonists, lidocaine, and other antiarrhythmic agents declined over this period.

In this study, the inhibition time courses of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity after intravenous administration of enalaprilat encapsulated in intact erythrocytes was evaluated and compared with free drug, in a rabbit model. Three groups of animals each received free drug, drug-loaded erythrocytes or sham-encapsulated erythrocytes. Serum ACE activity was determined in each case using the synthetic substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine and quantitation of the hippuric acid released by a developed and validated HPLC method. The serum ACE inhibition profiles in the three groups showed that the encapsulated drug inhibited the serum ACE more slowly, more efficiently, over a considerably longer time and in a more reproducible manner, than the free drug or sham-encapsulated erythrocytes. We conclude that the erythrocytes can serve as efficacious slow-release drug carriers for enalaprilat in circulation.",

These trials have modified and enhanced the therapeutic paradigm for heart failure and extended treatment goals beyond limiting congestive symptoms of volume overload. Part II of this two-part article presents treatment recommendations for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The authors recommend that, if tolerated and not contraindicated, the following agents be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in all patients; a beta blocker in all patients except those who have symptoms at rest; and spironolactone in patients who have symptoms at rest or who have had such symptoms within the past six months.

The usefulness of anticoagulant or beta-blockers as preventive treatment for these high-risk patients remains to be determined. HYPERLIPIDEMIA: A retrospective analysis of 530 kidney transplant recipients demonstrated that a very significant proportion of those with dyslipidemia are not receiving appropriate care although their lipid profile is indicative of a high or very high cardiovascular risk. MASSIVE PROTEINURIA: An angiotensin II inhibitor, losartan, has been found to be effective against massive proteinuria (> 3.5 g/l) occurring after kidney transplantation.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardio-myopathy (HCM) are more common than restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is extremely rare in pediatric age groups. Treatment should be targeted at the cause of the cardiomyopathy, if identified. Nutritional deficiencies, metabolic disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism should be corrected if possible. Immunosuppressive therapy may be considered in patients with lymphocytic myocarditis. Maximal medical therapy with inotropic drugs or cardiac glycosides, diuretic drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve heart failure symptoms in patients with DCM. Beta-blocker therapy in adults with DCM is well established and is being evaluated in children with DCM. High-dosage beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy improves the survival rate in children with HCM. The cautious use of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with RCM improves symptoms. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism in patients with DCM and RCM is indicated. Antiarrhythmia therapy is needed in patients with DCM- or HCM-associated dysrhythmia.

A total of 1,715 subjects randomized during a 3-year period were followed a minimum of 2 years. The goal for all treatment groups was to achieve equivalent blood pressure control, with the blinded study drug (irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo) as primary therapy with additional antihypertensive drugs, excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, to achieve seated systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 85 mm Hg. The primary outcome was the combined endpoint of time to doubling of entry serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary outcomes included fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. A Clinical Management Committee monitored the conduct of the study. An Outcome Confirmation Committee classified all study outcome events in blinded fashion. An external Data Safety Monitoring Committee monitored unblinded data for interim safety and efficacy analyses of the study. Eligibility criteria included informed consent, age 30 to 70 years, adult-onset diabetes, hypertension, urine protein excretion greater than 900 mg/24 hours, and serum creatinine values of 90 to 265 micromol/L in women and 110 to 265 micromol/L in men.

    "447": "In the last few decades, clinical and experimental data have established microalbuminuria/proteinuria as an independent risk factor for renal disease and for progression of renal disease in patients with diabetes and in those with essential hypertension. Reduction of proteinuria with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been shown in clinical trials to delay or stabilize the rate of progression of renal disease. This effect appears to be independent of any effect on blood pressure control. In conjunction with other therapeutic interventions such as dietary modification and control of serum lipids, it appears that for at least a subgroup of patients, it is possible to delay or prevent progression of kidney failure. More recently, evidence has accumulated that establishes microalbuminuria/proteinuria as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality even in those without other clinical evidence of kidney disease. There is frequently a clustering of risk factors in these individuals that includes insulin resistance, salt-sensitivity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The mechanism of this relationship of proteinuria and cardiovascular disease is unclear, but the presence of proteinuria as a marker for cardiovascular disease has important implications for the identification and treatment of individuals at risk.", 
    "448": "Cyclosporine (CsA) has been successfully used for treatment of children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and nephrotic syndrome (NS) for the last decade. Response rates of 50% to 100% have been reported using twice-daily dosing of 5 to 32 mg/kg/d, achieving trough blood levels of 70 to 500 ng/mL. Treatment has been associated with a high incidence of side effects, including nephrotoxicity, hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, and hirsutism. To determine whether once-daily low-dose CsA could minimize side effects and still induce remission, 21 children with biopsy-proven FSGS and NS, each treated with CsA, 4.6 +/- 0.8 mg/kg/d, with no predetermined target trough blood levels, were studied. Eleven of 21 children (52%) attained complete remission and 5 of 21 children (24%) attained partial remission, for a total response rate of 76%. Mean time to response was 2.8 +/- 0.8 months, and mean duration of therapy was 20.6 +/- 13.7 months. CsA dosage was tapered or stopped in 9 responders; 3 of these patients maintained remission at last follow-up 6 to 13 months later, and 6 patients relapsed at 1.5 to 18.7 months (mean, 8.7 months). Five of these 6 patients responded again when CsA therapy was restarted or the dosage was increased. Twelve of 16 responders were still being administered CsA at last follow-up 11 to 60 months (mean, 24.6 months) later. Five of 21 patients (24%) had no response to CsA during 2 to 27 months of therapy; 4 of these 5 patients developed end-stage renal disease after CsA therapy was stopped. Side effects of CsA therapy were minimal: 1 patient each developed new-onset hypertension or gingival hyperplasia, and no patient had hirsutism or nephrotoxicity. Single daily low-dose CsA appears to be effective for long-term treatment of children with FSGS and NS, with fewer side effects than twice-daily dosing.",

Statistical analysis (log rank test) of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves over 72 hours showed no difference between losartan and controls nor between the various groups treated with ACEI. However survival was significantly lower in the ACEI groups than in the group treated by losartan alone (p < 0.02) or controls (p < 0.02). Intraaortic mean arterial pressure was measured in 6 controls, 6 animals treated with losartan and 6 other treated with enalapril. It was comparable in the losartan and enalapril treated animals (65 +/- 2 mm Hg vs 64 +/- 2) but significantly lower than in the controls (77 +/- 2 mmHg) (p < 0.02).",

    "459": "It is admitted that low dose of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors allows the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (HVG) in experimental models where plasma renin activity (PRA) is high. The use of low dose of ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, make it possible to explore the place of cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regression of HVG independently of blood pressure (BP). Twenty rats TGR (mRen2) 27, heterozygous male, 10 weeks old were treated by daily oral gavage during 6 weeks by 10 micrograms/kg/jour ramipril or distilled water and compared to 10 normotensive Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. BP was measured. After the period of treatment, plasma, left kidney and the ventricles were removed. On each tissue samples and plasma, angiotensinogen (Aogen), the renin activity, angiotensins I (Ang I) and II (Ang II) were determined by radioimmuno assay and the activity of ACE was measured by fluorimetry. BP does not differ between treated and untreated groups during 6 weeks of treatment but is significantly higher compared to SD rats. PRA of untreated rats is high (36 +/- 5 ng Ang I/mL/h). However, treatment did not make it possible to decrease HVG. In plasma and kidney treatment's effect on SRA is confirmed by the increase in renin activity (plasma: 63 +/- 9 vs 36 +/- 5 ng Ang I/mL/h; kidney: 127 +/- 11 vs 92 +/- 7 micrograms Ang I/g/h) which is accompanied by an increase of Ang I rates (plasma: 297 +/- 31 vs 15 +/- 10 fmol/mL; kidney: 241 +/- 37 vs 160 +/- 12 fmol/g) and of the reduction in Aogen. An inhibition of ACE is perceptible with low dose of ramipril in heart (left ventricle: 1.7 +/- 0.1 vs 2.5 +/- 0.3 nmol HisLeu/min/mg protein), but it does not appear significant modifications of the other elements of the RAS in this tissue. The Ang II cardiac rates are probably not solely defined by cardiac ACE activity, other ways of synthesis being described. The absence of regression of the HVG in TGR (mRen2) 27 rat with low dose of ramipril could be related to the absence of effect on cardiac Ang II rates. In addition, the relation between high PRA rates and the effectiveness of low dose of ACE inhibitor in the HVG are not confirmed.", 
    "460": "Until recently, arterial stenosis and occlusion due to buildup of atherosclerotic plaque were recognized as the primary causes of coronary heart disease (CHD). Currently, CHD is viewed as a lifelong process of endothelial inflammation, thrombosis, and plaque instability and rupture. Lifestyle modification is an important first step in prevention of CHD, but even those patients who are the most committed to following a healthy diet and lifestyle frequently require the addition of drug therapy to further reduce risk. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce risk by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as by stabilizing plaques, restoring endothelial function, and counteracting oxidative and inflammatory processes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also have antiatherogenic properties. Early, aggressive lipid intervention is the key to primary and secondary prevention of CHD.",

Internists prescribed proportionately fewer angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazides and other diuretics compared with the FPs and/or GPs but more beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. A large proportion of the FPs and/or GPs (55.3%) prescribed less than 10% of the total day's supply of drugs, whereas a small proportion of FPs and/or GPs (16.3%) prescribed 52.6% of all the study drugs.

    "466": "This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of selected antihypertensives (doxazosin, amlodipine, enalapril, and bendrofluazide) in maintaining 24-hour control of blood pressure (BP). The predictive value of ambulatory (A)BP versus clinic (C)BP measurements as a method for detecting patients with hypertension was also evaluated. A total of 204 patients were screened and of these 110 were diagnosed as mild to moderately hypertensive with clinic diastolic BP 100-110 mm Hg (> or =95 mm Hg in patients with coronary heart disease risk factors). The 4 antihypertensives were all equally effective at controlling BP over 24 h, as shown by 24-hour ABP measurements. The incidence of adverse events was similar for all 4 treatment groups; headache was the most common event, being reported by 22 patients (20%). There was a clinically relevant reduction in total cholesterol for the doxazosin (-15.4 mg/dl) and amlodipine (-11.6 mg/dl) treatment groups in comparison with enalapril and bendrofluazide. Our results from ABP measurements suggest that the antihypertensives studied are effective first-line therapy in the regulation of hypertension and that ABP is a reproducible measure. ABP may also be useful in identifying patients with various types of high BP, for instance those with 'white coat' hypertension, enabling more accurate screening and diagnosis.",

The neurohormones include angiotensin II, norepinephrine, aldosterone, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and tumor necrosis factor. These responses are initially adaptive, but become maladaptive in the long term, impairing the function of the heart, vasculature, and kidneys. Counter-regulatory hormones, such as bradykinin and natriuretic peptides, are insufficient to offset the adverse effects of the other neurohormones. Most drugs used to treat chronic heart failure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and spironolactone, achieve their benefits through altering the neurohormonal pathways. New agents that affect more or different neurohormones may soon be available.",

    "471": "Renal dysfunction occurring after open heart surgery is multifactorial in origin but activation of the renin-angiotensin system may have a prominent role. Fourteen patients with ischaemic heart dysfunction scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were allocated to a treatment group [enalaprilat for 2 days; ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) group, n=7] or a control group (n=7). The cardiac index was significantly higher in ACEI-treated patients than in the controls before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (P<0.05) and on postoperative day 2 (P<0.05). The systemic vascular resistance was significantly lower in the ACEI-treated patients than in the controls before and after CPB (P<0.05). Renal plasma flow, measured as [131I]orthoiodohippuran clearance (ClH), was higher in the ACEI group than in the control group before CPB, as was endogenous creatinine clearance after CPB (P<0.05). On post-operative day 7, ClH was significantly higher in the ACEI group than in the control group (P<0.05). Plasma renin activity and vasopressin concentration increased in both groups during CPB (P<0.05). The study demonstrates that administration of an i.v. ACEI, enalaprilat, improves cardiac output during CABG surgery in patients with ischaemic heart dysfunction. Moreover, renal perfusion was better maintained during surgery, and this effect was sustained up to post-operative day 7.", 
    "472": "The Oxford Record Linkage Study (ORLS; an epidemiological database) was used to examine relationships between intercurrent cardiovascular drug therapy and cardiac death within 30 days of elective or emergency/urgent surgery under general anaesthesia. Cases identified from the ORLS were paired with matched control patients. Clinical details were obtained from the patients' medical notes. In elective surgical patients, there was no effect of beta-adrenoceptor or calcium entry channel blockade, diuretics or digoxin on cardiac death after adjusting for confounding variables. Use of nitrates was associated with an odds ratio of 4.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-22.72] for cardiac death after adjustment for confounding by a history of angina and residual age difference. In emergency/urgent patients, there were significant univariate associations with cardiac death for intercurrent use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (odds ratio 1.18) and diuretics (odds ratio 4.95; 95% CI 1.82-13.46). However, neither maintained significance after adjustment for the confounding effect of cardiac failure. We conclude that, with the possible exception of the use of nitrates in elective surgical patients, chronic intercurrent drug treatment alone does not significantly affect the odds of cardiac death within 30 days of surgery.",

    "477": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is present in the human prostate and may be activated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), possibly contributing to the pathophysiology of this disorder by enhancing local sympathetic tone and cell growth. The functional role of the RAS in the prostate, however, is unknown. The present study was undertaken to determine whether angiotensin (Ang) II enhances sympathetic transmission in the prostate. The neuronal stores of the rat prostate were labelled with [(3)H]noradrenaline (NA). Ang II and Ang I enhanced [(3)H]NA release in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ang II receptor subtype 1 (AT(1) receptor) antagonist losartan and the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319 inhibited this facilitatory effect of Ang II and Ang I, whereas the other AT(2) receptor antagonist, CGP42112, was without effect. Bradykinin also increased [(3)H]NA release, which was inhibited by the B(2) receptor antagonist Hoe140. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril inhibited the effect of Ang I, but potentiated that of bradykinin. Interestingly, captopril alone produced an increase in [(3)H]NA release which was inhibited by Hoe140. Losartan, but not PD123319 or CGP42112, inhibited [(125)I]-Ang II binding in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the AT(1a) or AT(1b) receptor. In contrast, in cells expressing the AT(2) receptor, PD123319 and CGP42112, but not losartan, inhibited [(125)I]-Ang II binding. In conclusion, Ang II enhances the release of NA from sympathetic nerves of the rat prostate via a novel functional receptor distinct from the cloned AT(1a), AT(1b) or AT(2). These data provide direct evidence in support of a functional role for the local RAS in modulating sympathetic transmission in the prostate, which may have important implications for the pathophysiology of BPH.", 
    "478": "Data on patients receiving antihypertensive therapy were collected from 20 general practitioners (GPs) in Campania, Italy, to determine the prescription of different antihypertensive classes and their use with other drugs for concomitant diseases, to investigate the main factors influencing antihypertensive choice, to document treatment outcome, and to assess adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Each GP completed a data card for each consultation that produced an antihypertensive prescription; 1900 cards were collected. The most frequently used antihypertensives were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (49.6%), calcium antagonists (24.8%), beta blockers (11.7%), angiotensin II-receptor blockers (5.5%), and alpha blockers (0.9%). In 82% of patients, blood pressure was reduced but did not reach normotensive levels. The choice of antihypertensive treatment was influenced by international guidelines (56%), clinical diagnosis (25%), concomitant diseases (8%), cost (4%), compliance (3%), and other factors (5%). ADRs--most often cough (35.7%), edema (22.7%), headache (13.3%), and tachycardia (7.8%)--occurred in 11.8% of patients.", 
    "479": "New insights into the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaques leading to acute myocardial infarction (MI) are discussed, along with new diagnostic and treatment strategies. Ischemic heart disease represents a continuum from stable angina to unstable angina to non-Q-wave MI to Q-wave MI. Patients whose angina becomes unstable are classified as having acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It was formerly believed that thrombosis leading to critical occlusion of coronary arteries at the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture was the common cause of ischemic heart disease. It is now thought that even lesions that do not critically occlude coronary arteries can cause MI. ACS can be caused by the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque. Vulnerable plaques are usually those causing only mild to moderate stenosis and having a lipid-rich core and a thin, macrophage-dense, collagen-poor fibrous cap. Factors affecting plaque rupture include mechanical injury, circadian rhythm, inflammation, and infection. Progressive thrombosis and vasospasm may follow plaque rupture. The diagnosis of MI starts with the recognition of symptoms of myocardial ischemia that are new or different from the usual pattern. Agents used to prevent or treat plaque rupture and its complications include thrombolytics, antiplatelet agents, antithrombotics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and nitrates. Once patients survive the acute phase of MI, long-term therapy for prevention of future events begins. Post-MI patients should receive aspirin, beta-blockers, and an ACE inhibitor indefinitely; modification of cardiovascular risk factors is also important. Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of ACS has led to strategies to limit the progression of atherosclerosis and to improve survival and function after an acute event.", 
    "480": "The involvement of angiotensin AT1 receptors in sodium appetite was studied in hypothyroid rats treated with the angiotensin II antagonist losartan. Losartan was administered chronically by the oral route or acutely by the subcutaneous route after water and sodium depletion or water, sodium and food deprivation. Three days after addition of losartan to the food at the dose of 1.0 mg x g(-1), the rats significantly reduced (P < 0.02) their spontaneous intake of 1.8% NaCl. Increasing the dose of losartan to 2.0 and 4.0 mg x g(-1) did not reduce NaCl intake; in contrast, the intensity of the sodium appetite gradually returned to previous levels. The simultaneous administration of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and losartan significantly increased (P < 0.05) NaCl intake and after captopril removal NaCl intake returned to the levels observed with losartan treatment alone. The administration of losartan 4 days after the beginning of captopril treatment significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) NaCl intake. Following acute administration of losartan, water- and sodium-depleted rats significantly reduced their NaCl and water intake (P < 0.001). The administration of losartan also induced a significant reduction in NaCl and water intake in water, NaCl and food-deprived rats (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The present results show that chronic treatment with oral losartan inhibited spontaneous sodium appetite in hypothyroid rats. Continuation of treatment rendered rats resistant to the blockade of AT1 receptors. Water and sodium depletion and water, NaCl and food deprivation induced sodium appetite, which in the short term depends on cerebral angiotensinergic activity mediated by the activation of AT1 receptors.", 
    "481": "We showed recently that post-frusemide (furosemide) natriuresis was associated with a major depression of medullary circulation. In the present study, prior to administration of frusemide the tubular transport of NaCl was modified by loading the animals with 5% saline to elucidate a possible interrelation between the tubular and vascular effects of the drug. Moreover, a possible involvement of the renin-angiotensin system was examined by pharmacological blockade using captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (1 mg x kg(-1), I.V.), or losartan, a selective inhibitor of angiotensin AT1 receptor (10 mg x kg(-1), I.V.). The effects of frusemide (0.25 mg x kg(-1) I.V., then the same dose given over 1 h) on renal medullary and cortical circulation (using laser-Doppler flowmetry) and renal excretion of sodium (U(Na)V), water and total solutes were measured in anaesthetised rats. With no pre-treatment, frusemide decreased the medullary flow (36.6 +/- 6.0%) significantly more than the cortical flow (10.1 +/- 1.0%; P < 0.001). The difference between the medulla and cortex was not significant in rats which showed high U(Na)V after hypertonic saline loading (2.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 micromol x min(-1) in non-loaded rats): 21.1 +/- 3.9% and 15.8 +/- 1.5%, respectively. At very high U(Na)V (9.5 +/- 1.1 micromol x min(-1)) the post-frusemide decrease in blood flow tended to be smaller in the medulla (7.6 +/- 7.7%) than in the cortex (16.2 +/- 2.6%). The fall in medullary blood flow was attenuated by pre-treatment with captopril (22.0 +/- 3.3%) and abolished by pre-treatment with losartan (2.8 +/- 11.8%). The decrease in cortical blood flow was not changed by hypertonic saline or angiotensin II blockers. The abolition of the post-frusemide depression of medullary blood flow by previous salt loading confirms the proposed link between tubular transport status and vasoconstriction. A similar modification of the response by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system suggests that the system is involved in the mechanism of medullary vasoconstriction.", 
    "482": "Elevated neurohumoral activity and an abnormal cardiopulmonary response to exercise are well-established characteristics in patients after the Fontan operation. However, there have been few studies addressing cardiac autonomic nervous activity (CANA) in these patients.", 
    "483": "We evaluated CANA in 63 post-Fontan patients and 44 controls. Cardiac parasympathetic nervous activity (PSNA) was estimated by heart rate (HR) changes after cholinergic blockade, HR variability, and arterial baroreflex sensitivity. Cardiac sympathetic nervous activity was estimated by the heart to mediastinum [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine activity ratio (H/M) and the HR increase (DeltaHR) after isoproterenol infusion (beta). DeltaHR and peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)) were measured by exercise test. There was no difference in beta between the Fontan group and controls. PSNA and H/M were markedly lower than in controls (P<0.001). PSNA and beta were related to DeltaHR (P<0.05); however, peak VO(2) was not correlated with DeltaHR. Neither PSNA nor H/M was associated with clinical features, including hemodynamics, type of repair, number of surgical procedures, age at Fontan operation, or follow-up period, and administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor did not improve the impaired CANA in these patients.", 
    "484": "After the Fontan procedure, postsynaptic beta-sensitivity is maintained and is important in DeltaHR during exercise as is PSNA, although DeltaHR does not determine exercise capacity. The lack of a relationship between CANA and clinical features implies that, in addition to surgical damage, the Fontan circulation per se may impair CANA. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration does not change this abnormality.", 
    "485": "Some clinical cases published in literature show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor administration may cause acute pancreatitis. In this work, the authors report a case of a patient affected by hypertension. Upon admission, the authors started antihypertensive therapy using captopril, which caused an important amylase and lipase rise within 13 days. When the ACE-inhibitor therapy was stopped, a rapid decrease of the serum enzyme was observed within 3 days. The high levels of serum amylase and lipase were linked to neutrophilia but were not associated with relevant symptomatic findings or features of pancreatopathy. The absence of the usual conditions that may cause pancreatitis, such as biliary stasis, hypercalcemia, or alcohol abuse, and the rapid decrease of serum enzyme levels after drug suspension suggested an ACE-inhibitor-induced pancreatitis. This is the first clinical report of an ACE-inhibitor-induced pancreatitis in which captopril administration was found after hospitalization. The drug suspension probably prevented other complications. This case report suggests that, when ACE-inhibitor administration is started, serum amylase and lipase should be monitored in order to prevent acute pancreatitis without waiting for clinical evidence of a pancreatopathy.",

They performed transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic examinations in hypertensive patients before and after treatment of hypertension. Three of the 24 patients had blood pressure that failed to respond to the regimen of antihypertensive therapy and were removed from the analysis. Of the remaining 21 patients, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at baseline were 170 +/- 18 and 104 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively, and fell significantly at 3 months to 141 +/- 10 and 90 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively, (p<0.001) after initiation of antihypertensive therapy. There was no significant change in heart rate with treatment (baseline 81 +/- 8 and at 3 months 84 +/- 9 beats/min). There was no significant change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular wall thickness, or left atrial diameter from baseline (49 +/- 4 mm, 58 +/- 5%, 12 +/- 1 mm, and 41 +/- 4 mm, respectively) at 3 months (48 +/- 5 mm, 59 +/- 4%, 12 +/- 1 mm, and 40 +/- 3 mm). The treatment caused a significant reduction in maximal LAA areas (6.3 +/- 1.3 cm2 at baseline, 4.6 +/- 0.7 cm2 at 3 months, p<0.001), with a concomitant increase in LAA emptying velocity (44 +/- 7 cm/sec at baseline, 60 +/- 9 cm/sec at 3 months, p<0.001). In conclusion, these findings suggest that reduction in blood pressure with antihypertensive therapy could improve LAA function in hypertensive patients with normal left ventricular systolic function in sinus rhythm.", 
    "487": "This report describes seven deaths caused by angioedema of the tongue related to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These seven cases were received in our office between 1998 and 2000. In that time frame we performed approximately 2000 autopsies. The cases involved African-American men and women, aged 51 to 65 years, all of whom had been prescribed an ACE inhibitor for the treatment of hypertensive heart disease. In each case, the external examination revealed markedly swollen tongues. The autopsies confirmed massive tongue swelling due to angioedema, and some patients also had swelling of the lips, pharynx, and larynx. Toxicologic analyses on postmortem blood samples were negative for ethanol and drugs of abuse. Although oral and pharyngeal swelling related to angioedema is well known in the clinical literature, its fatal potential has rarely been described.",

Although little known about the mechanism underlying CMD, several recent reports have demonstrated that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis could play a substantial role in CMD. On the other hand, angiotensin II (Ang II) has been reported to play an important role in the regulation of VSMC growth and apoptosis via the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and type 2 receptor (AT2R).", 
    "490": "To elucidate the role of Ang II signaling via the Ang II receptors in CMD, we investigated AT1R and AT2R mRNA expression and tissue concentration of Ang II in MFS aortas (n=10) and control aortas (n=12). Furthermore, we examined the effects of an ACE inhibitor, an AT1R blocker, and an AT2R blocker on serum deprivation-induced VSMC apoptosis by organ culture system. AT1R expression was significantly decreased (P<0.01) and AT2R expression was significantly increased (P<0.001) in MFS aortas compared with control aortas, and tissue Ang II concentration was significantly higher in CMD than in the control condition (P<0.01). Both the ACE inhibitor and AT2R blocker significantly inhibited serum deprivation-induced VSMC apoptosis (P<0.05), although the AT1R blocker did not inhibit apoptosis in cultured aortic media from MFS patients.",

    "493": "A myocardial infarction was created in 99 rats by coronary artery ligation. They were divided into 4 groups. Two groups did not receive any drug and were intramyocardially injected 7 days after the infarct with either culture medium alone (control rats, n=16) or autologous SM cells (2.3x10(6) myoblasts) previously expanded ex vivo for 7 days (myoblasts, n=24). Two other groups received the ACE inhibitor perindoprilat (1 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), started the day of the infarct and continued uninterruptedly thereafter, and underwent time-matched procedures, that is, they were intramyocardially injected at 7 days after infarction with either culture medium alone (ACE inhibitors, n=22) or autologous SM cells (2.5x10(6) myoblasts) previously expanded ex vivo for 7 days (ACE inhibitors+myoblasts, n=37). Left ventricular function was assessed by 2D echocardiography. At the end of the 2-month study, left ventricular ejection fraction (%, mean+/-SEM) was increased in all groups (myoblasts, 37.4+/-1.2; ACE inhibitors, 31.6+/-1.7; ACE inhibitors+myoblasts, 43.9+/-1.4) compared with that in control rats (19.8+/-0.7) (P<0.0001). The improvement in ejection fraction was similar in the ACE inhibitor and the myoblast groups (31.6+/-1.7 versus 37.4+/-1.2, P=0.0636). However, in the ACE inhibitor+myoblast group, this improvement was greater than that seen in hearts receiving either treatment alone (43.9+/-1.4 versus 31.6+/-1.7 in the ACE inhibitor group and 43.9+/-1.4. versus 37.4+/-1.2 in the myoblast group, P<0.0001 and P=0.0084, respectively).",

    "495": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is known to contribute to thrombus formation and to the development and the clinical course of acute and chronic cardiovascular disease, as well as of other arterial and venous thromboembolic diseases. Recently, an important role of elevated pretreatment levels of PAI-1 for failure of thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction has been discussed. PAI-1 plasma levels depend on the one hand on gene regulation but are related on the other hand to known risk factors of atherosclerosis like insulin resistance, diabetes or hypertriglyceridemia, respectively. Furthermore, an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) significantly contributes to the upregulation of PAI-1 concentration via a receptor-mediated mechanism. In accordance to the known mechanisms of regulation of PAI-1 plasma levels, the use of specific agents like antidiabetic drugs, fibrates, statins, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor-blockers may contribute to the downregulation of circulating PAI-1 and, therefore, increase the fibrinolytic capacity and consecutively counteract the thrombotic tendency. To further improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy, a PAI-1 resistant variant of t-PA, TNK-t-PA, has been developed and is now available for acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "496": "The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical significance of spatial and temporal analysis of left ventricular (LV) filling-flow propagation using color M-mode Doppler echocardiography before and after regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with hypertension. Seven patients with hypertensive LV hypertrophy were studied. Echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were performed both before and after 6 months administration of alacepril. LV mass index (LVMI), LV flow propagation velocity (FPV), and the maximal early transmitral flow velocity (E) were measured. LVMI, FPV, and FPV/E ratio were compared to before and after administration of alacepril. In addition, the correlation between LVMI and FPV/E ratio was evaluated. Results showed that LVMI was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and the FPV/E ratio was significantly increased (P < 0.05) after treatment with alacepril. There was no significant change in FPV. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between LVMI and the FPV/E ratio (r = -0.662, P < 0.001). The present study indicates that the FPV/E ratio could be a useful noninvasive parameter to assess the diastolic dysfunction associated with LV hypertrophy in patients with hypertension.", 
    "497": "The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating the hypertension in response to chronic reductions in uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) in conscious chronically instrumented pregnant rats. Mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in pregnant rats with chronic RUPP (125+/-3.0 mm Hg, P<0.01, n=12) than in pregnant rats (100+/-2.3 mm Hg, n=17). Plasma renin activity in pregnant rats with chronic RUPP was 17.1+/-2.5 nmol angiotensin I. L(-1). h(-1) compared with 21.9+/-3.5 nmol angiotensin I. L(-1). h(-1) in pregnant rats. Chronic oral administration of a converting-enzyme inhibitor (enalapril, 250 mg/L for 6 days) decreased mean arterial pressure to a similar extent in pregnant rats with chronic RUPP (109+/-4.2 mm Hg, P<0.01, n=9) and in normal pregnant (81+/-1.8 mm Hg, P<0.01, n=9) rats. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, however, had no significant effect on the blood pressure response to chronic RUPP as differences were similar in control (Delta25 mm Hg) and converting-enzyme inhibitor-treated (Delta27 mm Hg) groups. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system does not play a major role in mediating the hypertension produced by chronic RUPP in pregnant rats.", 
    "498": "Obesity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. The insulin resistance associated with obesity contributes to the development of other cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk for macrovascular and microvascular complications, thus predisposing patients to cardiac death, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, cerebral and peripheral vascular diseases, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Body weight reduction increases insulin sensitivity and improves both blood glucose and blood pressure control. Metformin therapy also improves insulin sensitivity and has been associated with decreases in cardiovascular events in obese diabetic patients. Antihypertensive treatment in diabetics decreases cardiovascular mortality and slows the decline in glomerular function. However, pharmacological treatment should take into account the effects of the antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. Diuretics and beta-blockers are reported to reduce insulin sensitivity and increase triglyceride levels, whereas calcium channel blockers are metabolically neutral and ACE inhibitors increase insulin sensitivity. For the high-risk hypertensive diabetic patients, ACE inhibition has proven to confer additional renal and vascular protection. Because hypertension and glycemic control are very important determinants of cardiovascular outcome in obese diabetic hypertensive patients, weight reduction, physical exercise, and a combination of antihypertensive and insulin sensitizers agents are strongly recommended to achieve target blood pressure and glucose levels.", 
    "499": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator neuropeptide, plays a counterregulatory role in subtotal nephrectomy-salt (SN-salt)-induced hypertension, reflecting a stimulation of the efferent vasodilator function of perivascular sensory nerves. To determine the effect of omapatrilat, a dual ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, on blood pressure and the potential antihypertensive role for CGRP, 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into 4 groups: (1) SN-salt, (2) SN-salt plus omapatrilat (80 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) in the drinking water), (3) sham-operated plus salt, (4) sham-operated plus salt and omapatrilat. After 11 days the mean arterial pressure was higher in the SN-salt group (174+/-10 mm Hg) versus the sham-operated-salt (109+/-4 mm Hg) and sham-operated-salt plus omapatrilat (105+/-3 mm Hg) groups. Omapatrilat treatment of the SN-salt rats significantly decreased the mean arterial pressure to 123+/-7 mm Hg and significantly reduced the heart-to-body weight ratio. Intravenous administration of a specific CGRP receptor antagonist produced a significant 10+/-2 mm Hg mean arterial pressure increase in the untreated SN-salt hypertensive rats but was without effect in the other groups. This indicates that CGRP does not contribute to the antihypertensive actions of omapatrilat. In addition, CGRP mRNA and protein content in dorsal root ganglia were decreased approximately 25% in the SN-salt plus omapatrilat rats. Thus, omapatrilat not only markedly reduces the blood pressure in this model of renal failure-induced hypertension but may also prevent the abnormal compensatory stimulation of the vasodilator activity of the peripheral sensory nervous system.", 
    "500": "Nephrosclerosis constitutes a major cause of end-stage renal disease. Independently of blood pressure control, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) are considered to be more nephroprotective than other antihypertensive agents. We have reviewed the long-term evolution of renal function in our series of essential hypertensive patients diagnosed as having nephrosclerosis when first seen in our unit. The analysis was performed depending on whether or not their antihypertensive therapy contained an ACEI alone or in combination for the whole follow-up. The end point was defined as the confirmation of a 50% reduction in creatinine clearance or entry in a dialysis program. A historical cohort of 295 patients was included in the analysis. Mean follow-up was 7.4+/-3.9 years. Diabetes prevalence was higher in ACEI-treated patients (25.7% versus 7.1%, P=0.000), but the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy could not be confirmed on clinical grounds, including renal biopsy. Twenty-three out of 183 (12.6%) patients in the ACEI group and 23 out of 112 (20.5%) patients in the non-ACEI group experienced a renal event (P=0.0104 by log rank test). Similar results were observed when only nondiabetic patients were considered for the analysis. Cox regression analysis showed that baseline serum creatinine, absence of ACEI administration, mean proteinuria during follow-up, and age were independent predictors for the development of a renal event. In hypertensive nephrosclerosis, therapy containing an ACEI alone or in combination significantly reduces the incidence of renal events. This effect is independent of blood pressure control.", 
    "501": "Hyperkalemia is widely viewed as a common complication of ACE inhibition in azotemic patients. These renal failure patients are the patients who benefit most from ACE inhibition. Because we could not confirm this notion after a retrospective evaluation of 236 azotemic patients, we studied 2 models of renal mass reduction. In the first, we did a 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) on rats and studied them 2 weeks after surgery (before chronic renal changes had developed). A second group was studied 16 weeks after Nx, once chronic renal failure was established. Rats in both models were treated with quinapril in drinking water. After baseline evaluation, we challenged them either by a high-K(+) diet or by blocking aldosterone receptors. We found that although quinapril blocked the K(+)-induced increase in aldosterone, serum K(+) levels and K(+) balance were maintained before and during high K(+) intake or during simultaneous spironolactone administration. We conclude that in hemodynamically stable rats with reduced renal mass and renal dysfunction, the administration of an ACE inhibitor does not cause severe hyperkalemia.", 
    "502": "Angiotensin (Ang) II, the main peptide of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), is a renal growth factor, inducing hyperplasia/hypertrophy depending on the cell type. This vasoactive peptide activates mesangial and tubular cells and interstitial fibroblasts, increasing the expression and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Some of these effects seem to be mediated by the release of other growth factors, such as TGF-beta. In experimental models of kidney damage, renal RAS activation, cell proliferation, and upregulation of growth factors and matrix production were described. In some of these models, blockade of Ang II actions by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) antagonists prevents proteinuria, gene expression upregulation, and fibrosis, as well as inflammatory cell infiltration. Interestingly, Ang II could also be involved in the fibrotic process because of its behavior as a proinflammatory cytokine, participating in various steps of the inflammatory response: Ang II (1) activates mononuclear cells and (2) increases proinflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, nuclear factor kappaB). Finally, Ang II also regulates matrix degradation. These data show that drugs controlling this complex vasoactive peptide are probably one of the best ways of avoiding fibrosis in progressive renal diseases.", 
    "503": "Blood pressure is influenced by several vasoactive factors that also regulate nephron transport. An imbalance in regulation of salt reabsorption by the nephron contributes to hypertension. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), the responses to dopamine and angiotensin II in the proximal nephron are diminished and enhanced, respectively. This partially explains why the proximal tubule of SHR absorbs more salt and water than that of normotensive controls. In the Dahl salt-sensitive rat, defects in NO signaling and alterations in the arachidonic acid/cytochrome P450 pathways are associated with increased salt reabsorption by the thick ascending limb. In other animal models, such as the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rat, hypertension develops as the result of an induced hormonal imbalance. By mimicking the effects of aldosterone, DOCA stimulates sodium reabsorption in the collecting ducts, causing salt and fluid retention. Thus, this model is similar to inherited forms of human hypertension caused by abnormal regulation of transport by mineralocorticoids, such as apparent mineralocorticoid excess and glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism. Overall, these findings demonstrate the significance of vasoactive compounds in regulating nephron transport and controlling blood pressure. However, important questions regarding humoral control of nephron transport and its implications in hypertension remain unanswered, and intensive research in these areas is required.", 
    "504": "The normal myocardium is composed of a variety of cells. Cardiac myocytes, tethered within an extracellular matrix of fibrillar collagen, represent one third of all cells; noncardiomyocytes account for the remaining two thirds. Ventricular hypertrophy involves myocyte growth. Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) includes myocyte and nonmyocyte growth that leads to an adverse structural remodeling of the intramural coronary vasculature and matrix. In HHD, it is not the quantity of myocardium but rather its quality that accounts for increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Structural homogeneity of cardiac tissue is governed by a balanced equilibrium existing between stimulator and inhibitor signals that regulate cell growth, apoptosis, phenotype, and matrix turnover. Stimulators (eg, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and endothelins) are normally counterbalanced by inhibitors (eg, bradykinin, NO, and prostaglandins) in a paradigm of reciprocal regulation. To reduce the risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death that accompanies HHD, its adverse structural remodeling must be targeted for pharmacologic intervention. Cardioprotective agents counteract the imbalance between stimulators and inhibitors. They include ACE and endopeptidase inhibitors and respective receptor antagonists. Cardioreparative agents reverse the growth-promoting state and regress existing abnormalities in coronary vascular and matrix structure. ACE inhibition has achieved this outcome with favorable impact on vasomotor reactivity and tissue stiffness. Today's management of hypertension should not simply focus on a reduction in blood pressure, it must also target the adverse structural remodeling that begets HHD.", 
    "505": "This article debates the important question of whether blood pressure lowering alone is responsible for the benefits accrued from antihypertensive therapy as demonstrated in many multicenter randomized clinical trials with different antihypertensive agents or whether there is evidence that some agents have special properties that result in benefits that go beyond those resulting from lowering blood pressure. Over the past >/=30 years, it has been demonstrated beyond any doubt that lowering blood pressure in severe forms of hypertension, and more recently in systolic and even mild hypertension, will result in reduced incidence of stroke and slower progression of heart and renal failure. These effects have been easier to demonstrate in sicker patients, because enough end points may be counted in the 3 to 5 years that these clinical trials last. However, risk attributable to high blood pressure comes, to a greater degree, from the much larger group of hypertensive individuals who have less severe forms of hypertension. Blood pressure lowering offers less protection from coronary heart disease, which is highly prevalent in hypertensive patients, than from stroke. With the introduction of agents such as renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or calcium channel blockers, it has been demonstrated that hypertensive vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction may be corrected. It has therefore been suggested that benefits beyond blood pressure lowering may be achieved with the use of specific drugs to lower blood pressure. Although some evidence suggests that this may be the case, it is difficult to extrapolate from mechanistic studies to prevention of hard end points in outcome trials and vice versa. The question remains for the time being largely unanswered.", 
    "506": "The increased effect of arterial wave reflections on central arteries like the common carotid artery seen in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients favors myocardial hypertrophy and oxygen consumption and alters coronary blood flow distribution. Nevertheless, the impact of wave reflection on the outcome and end points such as mortality remains to be demonstrated. One hundred eighty ESRF patients (age, 54+/-16 years) were monitored for 52+/-36 months (mean+/-SD). Seventy deaths, including 40 cardiovascular (CV) and 30 non-CV events, occurred. At entry, patients, in addition to standard clinical and biochemical analyses, underwent aortic pulse wave velocity measurement and determination of arterial wave reflexion by applanation tonometry on the common carotid artery that was expressed as augmentation index. Cox analyses demonstrated that predictors of all-cause and CV mortality were age, aortic pulse wave velocity, low diastolic blood pressure, preexisting CV disease, and increased augmentation index, whereas the prescription of an ACE inhibitor had a favorable effect on survival. After adjustment for all confounding factors, the risk ratio for each 10% increase in augmentation index was 1.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.86; P<0.0001) for all-cause mortality and 1.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 1.90; P<0.0001) for CV mortality. These results provide the first direct evidence that in ESRF patients increased effect of arterial wave reflections is an independent predictor of all-cause and CV mortality.", 
    "507": "Chronic inhibition of NO synthesis induces cardiac hypertrophy independent of systemic blood pressure (SBP) by increasing protein synthesis in vivo. We examined whether ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) enalapril and temocapril and angiotensin II type-I receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) losartan and CS-866 can block cardiac hypertrophy and whether changes in activation of 70-kDa S6 kinase (p70S6K) or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) are involved. The following 13 groups were studied: untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats and rats treated with NO synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), D-NAME (the inactive isomer of L-NAME), L-NAME plus hydralazine, L-NAME plus enalapril (3 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) or temocapril (1 or 10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), L-NAME plus losartan (10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) or CS-866 (1 or 10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), L-NAME plus temocapril-CS866 in combination (1 or 10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), and L-NAME plus rapamycin (0.5 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)). After 8 weeks of each experiment, ratios of coronary wall to lumen (wall/lumen) and left ventricular weight to body weight (LVW/BW) were quantified. L-NAME increased SBP, wall/lumen, and LVW/BW compared with that of control. ACEIs, ARBs, and hydralazine equally canceled the increase in SBP induced by L-NAME. However, ACEIs and ARBs equally (but not hydralazine) attenuated increase in wall/lumen and LVW/BW induced by L-NAME. The L-NAME group showed both p70S6K and ERK activation in myocardium (2.2-fold and 1.8-fold versus control, respectively). ACEIs inactivated p70S6K and ARBs inactivated ERK in myocardium, but hydralazine did not change activation of either kinase. Thus, ACEIs and ARBs modulate different intracellular signaling pathways, inhibiting p70S6K or ERK, respectively, to elicit equal reduction of cardiac hypertrophy induced by chronic inhibition of NO synthesis in vivo.", 
    "508": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), hypertension is mediated in part by an enhanced renovascular response to angiotensin (Ang) II. Pertussis toxin normalizes renovascular responses to Ang II and lowers blood pressure in SHR, suggesting a role for altered G(i) signaling in the enhanced renovascular response to Ang II in SHR. To further investigate this hypothesis, we measured reductions in renal blood flow and increases in renovascular resistance in response to intrarenal infusions of Ang II in the presence and absence of coactivation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (ie, receptors selectively coupled to G(i)) with UK 14,304 in adrenalectomized, renal-denervated, captopril-pretreated SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. In SHR, but not Wistar-Kyoto rats, UK 14,304 markedly enhanced renovascular responses to Ang II and vasopressin. However, UK 14,304 did not enhance renovascular responses to methoxamine (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist) in either strain. In uninephrectomized, normotensive Sprague-Dawley animals and in Sprague-Dawley rats with nongenetic hypertension induced by uninephrectomy, chronic administration of deoxycorticosterone acetate, and 1% saline as drinking water, UK 14,304 had little or no effect on renovascular responses to Ang II. In SHR, intrarenal infusions of U73122, a phospholipase C/D inhibitor, blocked the enhancement of renovascular responses to Ang II by UK 14,304. We conclude that activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors selectively enhances renovascular responses to Ang II and vasopressin in vivo in animals with genetic hypertensive but not in normotensive animals or animals with acquired hypertension. These results suggest that in SHR, there is a genetically mediated enhanced cross talk between the G(i) signal transduction pathway and signal transduction pathways activated by Ang II and vasopressin, but not methoxamine, and involving phospholipase C and/or D.", 
    "509": "During the course of our studies into the control of fluid extravasation from the splenic vasculature, we found that intrasplenic inhibition of NO biosynthesis caused an increase in systemic blood pressure. The present experiments were designed to investigate the mechanisms underlying this novel observation. There was an increase in mean arterial pressure when the nonspecific NO inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) was infused via the splenic artery but not when the same dose was administered systemically. Conversely, blood pressure decreased after intrasplenic but not systemic administration of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine. There was no pressor response to intrasplenic administration of either the inducible or neuronal NO synthase inhibitors N-[3-(aminomethyl)-benzyl] aceramidine and L-N(5)-(1-imino-3-butenyl)-ornithine. The pressor response to L-NMMA was abolished by denervation of either the spleen or the kidney and by pretreatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. We propose that the spleen influences systemic blood pressure through a reflex pathway comprising splenic afferent nerves and renal sympathetic control of renin release.", 
    "510": "The paradigm for treating hypertension has shifted: Tighter control is the goal and a multidrug regimen is often the means, especially in high-risk patients.

    "512": "Pharmacological therapeutics in acute myocardial infarction. The acute myocardial infarct is one of the main causes of death among the adult population of the industrialized countries, and this pattern is starting to be paralleled in many developing countries. The mortality rate due to coronary diseases has decreased 30% in the last decade, thanks to the new therapeutic strategies and the guidelines developed by the American college of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, aimed at physicians, nurses, and health personnel in charge of patients with suspected myocardial infarct or with an established myocardial infarct. These guidelines and strategies explain the fundaments of the administration of thrombolytic agents, coronary angioplasty, surgery, and the use of betablockers, platelet antiaggregating agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These recommendations are followed at the Coronary Intensive Care Unit of the National Institute of Cardiology \"Ignacio Ch\u00e1vez\", and therefore it was necessary to perform this bibliographic review to continue with the safety standards established for the follow-up protocols of the ischemic patient, aimed at assessing their efficacy and efficiency.",

These inhibitors and blockers have also been useful in cases of left asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction, myocardial infarction and post-infarction and various nephropathies--not only diabetes dependent but due to other etiologies as well. Furthermore, its application in primary prevention of coronary cardiopathies has started to become evident. The main advantages of this new group of drugs are their relative harmlessness and lesser undesirable side effects, as those caused by other antihypertensives agents. The AT1 receptor inhibitors of angiotensin have actually not proven to be superior than the ACE inhibitors (although the latter are not worse) but are better tolerated and protect a greater period of time with a single dosage. A greater number of macro studies with selective AT1 receptor blockers is necessary to know its right place in therapeutics.",

In addition, the NO synthase inhibition caused a marked thickened tunica intima (150% thicker than the control value) and a significantly augmented intima : media ratio (126% higher than the control value). On the other hand, captopril prevented hypertension in rats simultaneously treated with L-NAME as compared with controls, and induced intimal remodeling comprising the same qualitative changes as those observed in L-NAME-treated rats. The tunica intima of l-NAME + captopril-treated rats was moderately thickened (60% increase in comparison with that of controls and 65% thinner as compared with L-NAME-treated rats). In the same way, the mean intima : media ratio of rats concomitantly treated with L-NAME and captopril was moderately increased (45% more) as compared with controls and significantly lower in comparison with rats administered L-NAME alone (36% less).",

    "522": "1. Inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) have been shown to exert their cardioprotective actions through a kinin-dependent mechanism. ACE is not the only kinin degrading enzyme in the rat heart. 2. Since aminopeptidase P (APP) has been shown to participate in myocardial kinin metabolism to the same extent as ACE, the aims of the present study were to investigate whether (a) inhibition of APP leads to a reduction of myocardial infarct size in a rat model of acute ischaemia and reperfusion, (b) reduction of infarct size is mediated by bradykinin, and (c) a combination of APP and ACE inhibition leads to a more pronounced effect than APP inhibition alone. 3. Pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats were subjected to 30 min left coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 h reperfusion. The APP inhibitor apstatin, the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat, or their combination were administered 5 min before ischaemia. Rats receiving HOE140, a specific B(2) receptor antagonist, were pretreated 5 min prior to enzyme inhibitors. Myocardial infarct size (IS) was determined by tetrazolium staining and expressed as percentage of the area at risk (AAR). 4. IS/AAR% was significantly reduced in rats that received apstatin (18+/-2%), ramiprilat (18+/-3%), or apstatin plus ramiprilat (20+/-4%) as compared with those receiving saline (40+/-2%), HOE (43+/-3%) or apstatin plus HOE140 (49+/-4%). 5. Apstatin reduces IS in an in vivo model of acute myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion to the same extent than ramiprilat. Cardioprotection achieved by this selective inhibitor of APP is mediated by bradykinin. Combined inhibition of APP and ACE did not result in a more pronounced reduction of IS than APP-inhibition alone.",

In the present study, the safety, tolerability, and hemodynamic effects of single oral doses of omapatrilat (1 to 50 mg) are compared with placebo in patients with heart failure. Patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) and a resting left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-panel study of single doses of omapatrilat of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg, followed by hemodynamic assessment for 24 hours. At 4 to 6 hours after dosing, the 25- and 50-mg doses of omapatrilat, compared with placebo, reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by approximately 6 mm Hg from 20 and 23 mm Hg at baseline to 14 and 16 mm Hg. The 50-mg omapatrilat dose maintained this effect compared with placebo with an approximately 2.5-mm Hg reduction in mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at 24 hours. Omapatrilat improved additional hemodynamic parameters, including cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume index, and mean arterial pressure. Additionally, by 2 hours after dosing with omapatrilat 25 and 50 mg, a trend in peak increases from baseline in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (twofold) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (nearly twofold) was observed. Moreover, omapatrilat was well tolerated. Thus, omapatrilat administered orally to patients with heart failure was safe and well tolerated and resulted in improved hemodynamic performance.",

The interaction of the enzyme with the inhibitor strongly depended on the presence of chloride in the medium, and the apparent dissociation constant of the ACE-chloride complex was (1.3 +/- 0.2).10(-3) M for the somatic enzyme. The dissociation kinetics of the complex of the inhibitor with somatic ACE did not fit the kinetics of a first-order reaction, but it was approximated by a model of simultaneous dissociation of two complexes with the dissociation rate constants (0.13 +/- 0.01) sec(-1) and (0.026 +/- 0.001) sec(-1) that were present at approximately equal initial concentrations. The dissociation kinetics of the single-domain ACE complexes with the inhibitor were apparently first-order, and the dissociation rate constants were similar: (0.055 +/- 0.001) and (0.041 +/- 0.001) sec(-1) for the N-domain and for testicular ACE, respectively.", 
    "525": "Cough assessment is an important component in the clinical evaluation of patients with respiratory and cardiovascular disorders (asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, etc.). A dry bothersome cough is the most common adverse class effect of all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). The present study was aimed to determine the feasibility of a new combined frequency/severity cough scoring method in patients with ACE-I induced cough before and after their modification with aspirin addition. The study was designed to compare two different regimens of active treatment: intermediate (500 mg) versus low (100 mg) dose aspirin in ACE-I cough suppression (self-matched control data) and comprised 21 patients (14 men, 7 women; mean age 62 +/- 11 years) on ACE-I treatment. ACE-I treatment was discontinued and the dry cough completely disappeared, but returned in all patients within one week (rechallenge period) after ACE-I reintroducing. Severity of cough was defined as follows: 0--no cough at all; 1--occasional hems; 2--mild, isolated cough, without additional symptoms; 3--moderate, paroxysmal cough, without additional symptoms; 4--severe, strenuous cough, accompanied by chest discomfort. In addition to cough severity score, cough frequency score (0-10) was obtained using a visual analog scale: 0 = I never cough; 10 = I cough all day. Low doses of aspirin were ineffective to suppress ACE-I induced cough. In contrast, intermediate doses completely abolished cough in 14 patients and reduced coughing in all but one patient. Cough severity and cough frequency scores decreased, respectively, from 2.6 +/- 1.1 to 0.7 +/- 1.0 (p<0.001) and from 6.9 +/- 2.2 to 2.1 +/- 2.4 (p<0.0001). Overall, the cough frequency score method alone could identify a beneficial modification of cough in 17 (81%) patients and cough severity score method alone in 17 (76%). Using the combined cough frequency/severity scoring, a beneficial modification of cough could be identified in 20 (95%) of patients. The new combined cough frequency/severity scoring is suitable for clinical practice and can improve the identification of dynamic cough modifications during treatment period as compared with the conventional frequency score method. It may have important implications in the evaluation of patients with respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "526": "This study examined thepharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fosinopril (IVand oral) in Chinese subjects to determine whether they were different from a group of somewhat heavier and older Western control subjects previously published using the same methods. It was an open-label, randomized, balanced, two-way crossover study comparing oral and IV pharmacokinetics in 12 healthy Chinese subjects in a clinic in Taiwan. Each subject received 10 mg of oral fosinopril or 7.5 mg of IV fosinoprilatin a randomized sequence with sampling for fosinoprilat concentrations over 48 hours. Standard pharmacokinetics, including AUC, Cmax Tmax, T 1/2, Vss, bioavailability, total clearance, and renal and nonrenal clearance, were determined as well as pharmacodynamic effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Following oral administration of 10 mg fosinopril, AUC0-T and AUCinf were 1,556 +/- 586 ng x hr/mL and 1,636 +/- 620 ng x hr/mL, respectively; T 1/2 was 17.4 +/- 11.4 hr; Cmax was 183.4 +/- 59.4 ng/mL; and median Tmax was 4.0 hr, with > 99% protein binding. Following IV administration of 7.5 mg fosinoprilat, AUC0-T and AUCinf were 7,727 +/- 2,638 ng x hr/mL and 7,816 +/- 2,693 ng x hr/mL, respectively; T 1/2 was 13.0 +/- 5.2 hr; and median Tmax was 4.0 hr, with 99.5% +/- 0.22% protein binding and a Vss of 5,850 +/- 2,780 mL. Bioavailability was 22.3% +/- 7.9%. Percent urinary excretion was 7.6% +/- 2.6% after oral dosing and 42.6% +/- 6.1% after IV dosing. After IV, dosing total clearance was 1,088 +/- 439 mL/hr, renal clearance was 472 +/- 213 mL/hr, and nonrenal clearance was 617 +/- 246 mL/hr. ACE inhibition was essentially complete through 12 hours and markedly reduced through 24 hours. Compared to a somewhat heavier and older previously reported control group, pharmacokinetic values were similar except for a slightly lower AUC and total clearance in Chinese and a statistically significantly lower nonrenal clearance. Pharmacodynamic effects on ACE activity were essentially identical. There is no reason to expect significant differences in fosinopril dosing or effect in a Chinese population compared to a Western population.", 
    "527": "The renoprotective efficacy of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (OMA) was compared with that of enalapril (ENA) in male Munich-Wistar rats subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy. ENA and OMA administered beginning on day 2 after surgery were equally effective in normalizing systolic BP (SBP) and preventing glomerulosclerosis (GS) for 12 wk. Micropuncture studies of rats performed using a similar treatment protocol demonstrated greater reduction of glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure with OMA than with ENA, at similar mean arterial pressures. To investigate whether these glomerular hemodynamic differences might be associated with differences in chronic renoprotective efficacy, additional rats were included in a protocol in which treatment was delayed until 4 wk after surgery (after the onset of hypertension and proteinuria) and continued for a longer period. Both treatments normalized SBP, but OMA resulted in more sustained reduction of proteinuria than did ENA. At week 20, OMA- and ENA-treated rats exhibited less GS than did untreated (control) rats at week 12, but only the difference in control versus OMA values was statistically significant [GS scores: control (12 wk), 36 +/- 4%; ENA (20 wk), 22 +/- 6%; OMA (20 wk), 14 +/- 2%]. The remaining ENA-treated rats were euthanized at 32 wk because of rapidly increasing proteinuria, whereas the remaining OMA-treated rats demonstrated a substantially slower increase in proteinuria until euthanasia at 50 wk. At this extremely late time point, OMA-treated rats exhibited GS scores similar to those of ENA-treated rats at 32 wk and control rats at 12 wk [GS scores: ENA (32 wk), 34 +/- 5%; OMA (50 wk), 38 +/- 8%]. It is concluded that, in this model, OMA affords greater long-term renoprotection than ENA when doses are adjusted to yield equivalent control of SBP.",

Among the 782 patients with confirmed CHF and an in-hospital left ventricular EF measurement, 45% had reduced systolic function (ReSF) (EF < 40%) and 55% had preserved systolic function (PrSF) (EF > 40%). The PrSF group had a lower 1-year mortality rate but similar hospital readmission rates for both CHF and all causes. In patients with ReSF, ACE inhibitor treatment was associated with a lower mortality rate (P =.04) and a trend toward a lower CHF readmission rate (P =.13). In contrast, ACE inhibition therapy was associated with neither a lower rate of mortality nor CHF readmission in PrSF patients (P =.61 and.12, respectively). In multivariate analyses treatment with ACE inhibitors in PrSF patients was not associated with either a reduction in mortality (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.79-1.67) or CHF readmission (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.92-1.58).",

Lineweaver-Burk, Dixon, and dose-response analyses revealed that GlySar uptake was competitively inhibited by fosinopril in both Caco-2 (K(i), 35.5 microM) and SKPT cells (K(i), 29.6 microM). Intracellular accumulations of fosinopril were 3 to 4 times higher from apical versus basolateral surfaces of the membrane, as was the apical-to-basal flux of the drug. The apical peptide transporter had a significantly greater affinity for fosinopril than did the basolateral peptide transporter in Caco-2 cells (K(m), 154 versus 458 microM, respectively; p < 0.001) and SKPT cells (K(m), 22 versus 104 microM, respectively; p < 0.001). Moreover, fosinopril uptake by the basolateral peptide transporter was less sensitive to changes in medium pH than the apical peptide transporter in both cell lines. Although Caco-2 cells are known to express PEPT1 protein (and not PEPT2), our immunoblot analyses provide definitive evidence that SKPT cells express PEPT2 protein (and not PEPT1). Taken as a whole, our findings demonstrate that fosinopril is transported intact by PEPT2 and PEPT1, with high-affinity and by a proton-coupled, saturable process. Our results also suggest that distinct peptide transporters exist at the basolateral and apical membranes and that they play an important role in modulating the intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of peptides and peptide-like drugs.",

Telmisartan 20 to 160 mg once daily produced mean reductions in supine trough systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of up to 15.5 and 10.5 mm Hg, respectively. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurred with a dosage of 40 to 80 mg/day.

The presentation of this disease is reviewed, and a treatment algorithm based on initial signs and symptoms is proposed for proper airway management. We performed a retrospective review of 108 patients treated in 2 tertiary care centers in the Washington, DC, area over a 5-year period. Ninety-eight patients (90.7%) were African-American, and 81 (75%) were female. Seventy-four patients (68.5%) were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). A classification system was developed based on the location of the edema at initial presentation: 1) isolated facial swelling and oral cavity edema, excluding the floor of the mouth; 2) floor of mouth and/or oropharyngeal edema, and 3) oropharyngeal edema with glottic and/or supraglottic involvement. Fourteen patients (13%) needed airway intervention, 2 of whom underwent a cricothyrotomy after a failed intubation attempt. Eleven (78.6%) were taking ACEIs. The indication for each intubation was massive tongue and floor of mouth edema. The patients were extubated 48 to 72 hours later. No patient demonstrated symptom progression after medical treatment was initiated. Therapy included discontinuation of the ACEI or other inciting agent, a high-humidity face tent, an initial dose of intravenous antihistamines, and a continued course of intravenous steroids. Within 48 hours, most patients had a resolution of their edema. Only cases of significant tongue and oropharyngeal edema took longer than 48 hours to resolve. The ACEIs are a common cause of angioedema. Left untreated, angioedema may progress to involve the oropharynx and supraglottis, resulting in a life-threatening airway compromise. Marked floor of mouth and tongue edema are the indications for airway intervention. An algorithm based on the initial presentation is essential for proper airway and patient management.

Circulating levels of bradykinin and kallidin and their metabolites, plasma and tissue kallikrein, low and high molecular weight kininogen, and kallistatin were measured before, during, and 1, 4, and 10 h after CPB in subjects undergoing cardiac surgery. Bradykinin peptide levels increased 10- to 20-fold during the first 10 min, returned toward basal levels by 70 min of CPB, and remained 1.2- to 2.5-fold elevated after CPB. Kallidin peptide levels showed little change during CPB, but they were elevated 1.7- to 5.2-fold after CPB. There were reductions of 80 and 60% in plasma and tissue kallikrein levels, respectively, during the first minute of CPB. Kininogen and kallistatin levels were unchanged. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition did not amplify the increase in bradykinin levels during CPB. Aprotinin administration prevented activation of the KKS. The changes in circulating kinin and kallikrein levels indicate activation of both the plasma and tissue KKS during activation of the contact system by CPB.", 
    "563": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a cardiovascular risk factor. A possible role for endothelial dysfunction in this condition was investigated in a Dunkin-Hartley guinea pig aortic-banded pressure overload-induced model of LVH. Aortic banding produced significant elevation of fore- and hindlimb blood pressure (BP), heart-to-body weight ratios, plasma angiotensin II (ANG II), endothelin-1 (ET-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, and coronary microvascular endothelial cell (CMEC) NAD(P)H-dependent superoxide (O) production, and a significant decrease in basal and stimulated CMEC cGMP levels. Treatment of aortic-banded animals with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril and the antioxidant vitamin C, either alone or in combination, did not affect BP but caused a significant inhibition of the increases in the heart-to-body weight ratio, ANG II, ET-1, and TNF-alpha levels, and O production and restored cGMP responses to levels comparable with sham-operated animals. These data suggest that quinapril and vitamin C are capable of inhibiting LVH development due to pressure overload via mechanisms that involve the inhibition of oxidative stress, an improvement in coronary endothelial function, and increased nitric oxide bioavailability.",

The patient was referred to ophthalmological investigation due to progressive loss of visual acuity. Although diabetes mellitus was not known, proliferative diabetic retinopathy with significant visual loss was found at fundus examination. Not only newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (initial fasting blood glucose 19.0 mmol/, HbA1c: 11.6%) but the presence of advanced sensory, motor and autonomic diabetic neuropathy (nervus peroneus motor conduction velocity: 32.1 m/s, nervus suralis sensory conduction velocity could not be detected, postural decrease in systolic blood pressure: 20 mmHg, beat-to-beat variation 6 beats/min, 30:15 ratio 1.03) as well as signs of advanced diabetic nephropathy (daily urinary protein excretion: 1.2-5.7 g, serum creatinine value: 101 mumol/l, sitting blood pressure: 150/100-180/100 mmHg) could be documented by further investigations at Medical Department. Avoiding short-term strict metabolic control insulin therapy was initiated and adequate long-term diabetic control was achieved later (HbA1c: 6.5-6.2%). In order to classify the diabetes, repeated measurements of serum C-peptide, ICA, GADA and IA2-antibodies were performed and type 2 diabetes was diagnosed. After a transient deterioration the proliferative retinopathy remained unchanged. Although laser photocoagulation was performed, no improvement in the visual acuity could be achieved. Only a minor improvement of neurological alterations was documented by repeated electrophysiological investigation at follow-up. Although the antihypertensive treatment (ACE-inhibitor drug in combination with calcium channel blocker) resulted in a significant decrease of elevated blood pressure, only a transient improvement of proteinuria could be achieved. Despite regular control, the advanced microangiopathic complications of diabetes mellitus carry poor prognosis.", 
    "565": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prevents the inactivation of bradykinin by inhibiting ACE activity, leading to side effects such as dry cough and angioedema. KD3-671 is a novel nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist which is expected to exhibit persistent hypotensive action without these side effects. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and cough-inducing effect of this drug in guinea-pig, compared with that of an ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat. KD3-671 was not significantly different from the vehicle treatment in the ability to induce coughing, whereas enalaprilat significantly enhanced coughing compared with the vehicle treatment. Thus, as expected from its mechanism of pharmacological action, KD3-671 did not induce coughing. We suggest that the citric acid-induced guinea pig coughing model will be useful in preclinical studies to examine the effect of drug on pulmonary function.",

We have evaluated the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on renal function and oxidative status in the kidney of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of spontaneous onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2. Enalapril (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (distilled water) was given once daily by gavage to 22-week-old male OLETF rats for 32 weeks. Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats, the control animals for OLETF rats, received vehicle alone (n = 10 in each group). 3. Enalapril attenuated the rise in blood pressure mildly, but significantly. Enalapril significantly blunted the development of proteinuria without a significant effect on creatinine clearance. At the end of the study period, the lipid peroxide content in the renal cortex was significantly increased in OLETF compared with LETO rats, in which enalapril had no effect on lipid peroxide content. Enalapril enhanced the activity of catalase in the renal cortex of OLETF rats, but had no effect on the activity of either superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase. 4. These results suggest that oxidative stress may be involved in the development of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. Enalapril exhibited renoprotective effects without changing lipid peroxides in the kidney, suggesting that the beneficial effects of the compound on diabetic renal damage in OLETF rats may not be mediated through an anti-oxidative action.",

The results show that PARM can build models with favorable cross-validation statistics (Rcv2 values 0.7-0.9) and give helpful SAR insight. PARM has certain advantages: (a) it can be used for many systems, regardless of whether the 3D structure of the receptor is known; (b) PARM models were demonstrated to be highly statistically reliable; and (c) PARM analyses are robust and reproducible.", 
    "572": "The highly active chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin, duanorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, and mitoxantrone are also associated with acute, largely reversible cardiotoxic effects and a dose-related cardiomyopathy. This cardiomyopathy is characterized by minimal left ventricular enlargement and global systolic dysfunction, usually with associated mild to moderate mitral insufficiency. Historically, this was characterized by myocardial biopsy and radionuclide angiography. More recently, echocardiography has become the most widely available and cost-efficient tool for diagnosis. The precise mechanism of this toxicity has not been fully defined. However, the maximum tolerated cumulative dose can by increased by reducing peak drug levels and concurrent administration of the iron chelator, dexrazoxane. Because anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is largely irreversible and cumulative, prevention is the preferred strategy. Monitoring by assessment of left ventricular function by the most reproducible method available as patients approach potentially toxic doses can substantially reduce toxicity. Stress studies before major procedures such as bone marrow or stem cell transplants may be of benefit. This syndrome responds well to conventional therapy for congestive heart failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics. The beta-blocker carvedilol is often associated with significant improvement in ejection fraction and symptoms and spironolactone is well tolerated and often of benefit. The long-term outlook of the syndrome is much better than previously reported because of advances in therapy and prevention.",

In the chymase inhibitor-treated group, the vein was infiltrated with 10 micromol/L Suc-Val-Pro-Phe(P)(OPh)(2) and was grafted to the carotid artery. In the placebo-treated group, ACE activity in the grafted veins was significantly lower than that in the control veins up to 7 days after the operation, whereas chymase activity was increased significantly. After 7 days, the mRNA levels of collagen I, collagen III, and fibronectin, all of which are induced by an increase of angiotensin II action, were significantly increased in the grafted veins, and the intima-media ratio of the grafted veins was also increased. In the chymase inhibitor-treated group, the chymase activity in the grafted veins 7 days after the operation was suppressed to 12.1%. The elevated mRNA levels of fibronectin, collagen I, and collagen III in the grafted veins were significantly suppressed by treatment with the chymase inhibitor, and the intima-media ratio was also decreased significantly.",

No significant between-treatment difference was detected in population subsets defined by monotherapy treatment, sex, age, race, or severity of baseline hypertrophy. Similarly, there was no between-treatment difference in change in velocities of early diastolic or atrial phase transmitral blood flow.

    "579": "The tissue renin-angiotensin system has recently been demonstrated to reduce fibrogenesis in various organs. However, little has been clarified regarding its role in hepatic fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on liver fibrogenesis induced in rats by low-dose chronic carbon tetrachloride administration. We used lisinopril that is absorbed in its active form and not metabolized in the liver to avoid any influence by the administration of the chemical. Carbon tetrachloride was administered twice a week i.p. Twelve and 24 weeks after the start of treatment, expanded periportal fibrosis or portal-portal bridgings and severe fat deposition were observed in the rats treated with carbon tetrachloride alone, and these findings were significantly reduced with the simultaneous treatment with lisinopril. The hydroxyproline content of the liver was significantly lower in the lisinopril-treated group. Angiotensin II up-regulated mRNA of pro alpha (I) collagen and transforming growth factor-beta in isolated hepatic stellate cells. These results suggest that the local tissue renin-angiotensin system plays a role in rat hepatic fibrogenesis induced by chronic carbon tetrachloride administration and that hepatic fibrogenesis is significantly reduced by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "580": "With current immunosuppression, elevated blood pressure is found in almost 90% of renal graft recipients. Major causes of this are impairment of renal function (secondary to chronic allograft nephropathy or less frequently recurrence of primary renal disease), the use of calcineurin inhibitors as immunosuppressants, uncontrolled renin secretion by the shrunken kidneys of the recipient, stenosing lesions of the transplant artery (or the upstream arteries of the recipient), polycythemia, and genetic predisposition to hypertension of the graft donor. Even minor degrees of blood pressure elevation have a significant impact on survival of the recipient and on graft survival, presumably by amplifying vascular injury to the graft. In this respect, elevation of systolic blood pressure and an abnormal circadian blood pressure profile are of particular relevance. In contrast to previous opinion, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated in treatment, but given the causal role of sodium retention and graft vasoconstriction, diuretics and calcium channel blockers remain mainstays of antihypertensive treatment in the renal allograft recipient.", 
    "581": "Chronic renal failure, proteinuria, and arterial hypertension run in parallel in the presence of diabetic nephropathy. New goal blood pressure levels have been established in diabetic patients: 130/85 mm Hg and 125/75 mm Hg depending on the level of proteinuria being below or above 1 g/d. New and lower threshold blood pressure (>130/85 mm Hg) to initiate pharmacologic therapy is required in the presence of diabetes mellitus in order to facilitate the strict blood pressure control that is required. It must be considered that both renal and cardiovascular protection are obtained with strict blood pressure control, which otherwise seems to require blockade of angiotensin II effects when proteinuria above 1 g/d is present. While awaiting the publication of long-term follow-up studies looking at renal and cardiovascular outcome in diabetic and other nephropathies in which calcium channel blockers are compared with other antihypertensive drugs, calcium channel blockers will remain the drugs needed to attain the expected goal blood pressure in diabetics, both alone (in the absence of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria) or in combination, particularly with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "582": "Meta-analysis has become a very popular tool to compare the efficacy of different antihypertensive regimens. Combining results from various outcome studies may provide evidence to guide the therapeutic approach even before results from large prospective studies are available. However, meta-analysis may be misleading if it is not done meticulously. Some meta-analyses that received broad news media coverage in the recent years were misleading. One analysis suggested that the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses in patients with coronary disease increased mortality. This claim was refuted later by observational studies. Based on another meta-analysis, it was claimed that diuretics and beta-blockers are equally effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Another more careful meta-analysis, omitting one study in which most patients were on combination therapy and not on beta-blocker monotherapy, showed the superiority of diuretic versus b-blocker treatment in the elderly. Calcium antagonists were recently blamed for increasing the rate of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in hypertensive patients, and therefore their use was not recommended as first-line therapy in hypertension. This recommendation was based on a meta-analysis subject to major drawbacks and was misleading. Another notion based on meta-analysis was that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce left ventricular mass more than diuretics. This notion was refuted by three large randomized studies. A recent meta-analysis, which showed a similar blood pressure lowering effect for all angiotensin receptor blockers, was refuted by head-to-head studies. Thus, when performed correctly, meta-analysis can be an important tool, but when uncritically employed, it is prone to be misleading.",

We treated 14-week-old female Wistar rats with losartan, enalapril or saline. Administration of the ACE inhibitor enalapril and angiotensin II antagonist losartan had no effect on total malondialdehyde (MDA) in the blood and on urinary excretion of some eicosanoids and their metabolites.

The marked clinical effect was achieved when these drugs were introduced into ischemized tissue in patients with obliterating atherosclerosis of lower extremity arteries. Development of the methods for studying endothelial function available for wide clinical practice will permit to raise the efficiency of initial and secondary prophylaxis of arterial hypertension, CHD. Today the evaluation and correction of endothelial dysfunction is the new and the most perspective direction in cardiology development.",

This study was performed in a cross-over fashion after a 2-week placebo period and 4 to 8 weeks each of treatment with temocapril and amlodipine. Of those 59 hypertensive patients, three patients with side effects and 10 patients whose office BPs did not achieve the target BPs were excluded, and the remaining 46 were analysed in this study: they consisted of 30 dippers, with a night time reduction in systolic BP (SBP) > or = 10% and 16 non-dippers, with reduction by < 10%. At the baseline, there were no significant differences in the office, 24-h or daytime BPs between the two groups (dippers and non-dippers). Though the office BPs and daytime BPs were successfully controlled to the same levels with both treatments and in both dipping groups, the antihypertensive effects were stronger with the CCB than with the ACE inhibitor in the night time and morning, especially in non-dippers. We conclude that even though office BPs were controlled successfully to almost the same levels, there is a possibility that these long-acting drugs have differential antihypertensive effects on night time and morning BPs among hypertensive patients with different night time BP dipping statuses.", 
    "586": "Adenosine was shown to inhibit norepinephrine (NE) release from sympathetic nerve endings. The purpose of this study was to examine whether endogenous adenosine restrains NE and epinephrine release from the adrenal medulla. The effects of an adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-(p-sulfophenyl) xanthine (DPSPX), on epinephrine and NE release induced by intravenous administration of insulin in conscious rats were examined. Plasma catecholamines were measured by HPLC with an electrochemical detector. DPSPX significantly increased plasma catecholamine in both control rats and rats treated with insulin. The effect of DPSPX on plasma catecholamine was significantly greater in rats treated with insulin. Additional experiments were performed in adrenalectomized rats to investigate the contribution of the adrenal medulla to the effect of DPSPX on plasma catecholamine. The effect of DPSPX and insulin on epinephrine in adrenalectomized rats was significantly reduced compared with that of the controls. Finally, we tested whether endogenous adenosine restrains catecholamine secretion partially through inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. The effect of DPSPX on plasma catecholamine in rats pretreated with captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was reduced. These results demonstrate that under basal physiological conditions, endogenous adenosine tonically inhibits catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla, and this effect is augmented when the sympathetic system is stimulated. The effect of endogenous adenosine on catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla is achieved partially through the inhibitory effect of adenosine on the renin-angiotensin system.",

Antibacterial agents: Concordance with a specified drug standard (nine drugs listed in the Australian Antibiotic Guidelines) increased substantially over time but was largely due to increased prescribing of two heavily promoted drugs.

N induced a significant decrease in TPR (about 15% of baseline values) and showed corresponding changes in STI. PRA increased significantly following I alone (1.5-2.0 ng/ml/h), as well as combined with N (2.5 ng/ ml/h) or H (3.1 ng/ml/h).

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, is synthesized by many types of cells including vascular endothelial cells. The serum level of ADMA is elevated in patients with essential hypertension, but the mechanism for this increase is unknown. Therefore, the present study examined whether the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved. Patients with essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 95 mmHg] were randomized to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment group (perindopril, 4mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist treatment group (losartan, 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7) or a beta-blocker treatment group (bisoprolol, 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7). Before and after the treatment, BP, serum concentration of ADMA and plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF, a biological marker of endothelial injury) were measured. Perindopril, losartan and bisoprolol decreased BP to a similar extent, and either perindopril or losartan, but not bisoprolol, significantly decreased serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These findings suggest that the RAS may contribute to the mechanism of increased serum ADMA as well as to the endothelial injury observed in hypertensive patients. The vasculoprotective actions of ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists may be explained at least in part by amelioration of the endothelial injury through a decrease in the serum ADMA concentration.", 
    "596": "The influence of a long-term treatment with losartan (50-100 mg o.d.) and captopril (25-50 mg b.i.d.) followed by the abrupt therapy cessation was studied in an open randomized placebo-controlled parallel group trial. The study was performed on a group of 22 essential (soft to moderate) hypertensive male patients, which entered the trial when a mean daytime diastolic blood pressure was BP > or = 90 Torr. The antihypertensive effect of losartan was more pronounced and homogeneous than the effect of an equivalent dose of captopril. The group-average trough/peak ratios upon the losartan treatment were 61.5 and 61.3% for the systolic and diastolic BP (against 21.2 and 26.9% for captopril), respectively. At the same time, the smoothness index values of the patients treated with losartan and captopril showed no significant difference. Neither treatment with any of the two drugs nor the therapy cessation affected the circadian BP profile or the BP variability. The abrupt termination of the drug administration did not cause a withdrawal syndrome: on the contrary, a significant effect of the captopril and losartan treatment (statistically reliable against the placebo control) persisted for at least four days after the therapy cessation. Taking into account poor homogeneity of the antihypertensive effect of captopril in patients with a stable moderate hypertension treated b.i.d., the drug administration is recommended according to the t.i.d. schedule. In this group of patients, losartan and captopril are probably more expediently administered in combination with other hypertensive drugs.",

    "602": "Just more than 20 years ago a group of associated findings was identified in patients with posterior urethral valves and persistent upper tract dilatation following valve ablation, including a noncompliant thick walled bladder, incontinence and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Subsequently the pseudonym \"valve bladder syndrome\" became associated with this phenomenon. The history of the valve bladder syndrome concept, continuing debate regarding the etiology and management of the valve bladder, and 20 years of urodynamic and histological investigations are reviewed.", 
    "603": "Outcome studies, histological findings, animal model experimentation and urodynamic investigations reported in the literature more than the last 20 years were reviewed and compared.", 
    "604": "Varying degrees of bladder compliance loss are seen in the majority of patients following valve ablation. Severe loss of compliance can lead to persistent upper tract dilatation and later urinary incontinence. A large urine output, secondary to a loss of renal concentrating ability, contributes to the persistent dilatation and incontinence. Correcting bladder compliance loss helps to lessen the dilatation and incontinence. A literature review revealed little to support the belief that previous temporary diversion is the major cause of severe compliance loss. In fact, instances of severe compliance loss were seen following any mode of therapy, including valve ablation alone, and likely represents a persistent finding secondary to the degree of damage incurred in utero. That there are more patients requiring augmentation after temporary diversion should not imply that diversion caused the poor compliance but that an initially poorly compliant bladder lead to diversion as the choice of treatment. Some investigators have found that many temporarily diverted cases have a bladder equal to or even better in function and capacity than those treated with valve ablation alone. Others have made a case but less substantially to conclude that diversion is the most significant cause of a small, poorly compliant bladder.", 
    "605": "Valve ablation alone without urodynamic followup is inappropriate. Proactive management must have a significant role. The vast majority of temporarily diverted cases do not result in a fibrotic, noncompliant bladder. Surgeons who strongly favor diversion should be comfortable with such an approach, although in most cases if diversion is considered, those same patients often can be treated just as adequately with proactive urodynamics and anticholinergic therapy without the required surgery for undiversion. With great anticipation, we look forward to studies that will determine if growth factor inhibitors or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors will have a role in preventing or reversing the histological changes of the valve bladder.",

    "607": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects on ischemic myocardium. We examined whether the ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat (EN), improves intracellular sodium homeostasis during myocardial ischemia and the relationship of this effect to bradykinin.", 
    "608": "EN (3.2 nM) was administered to isolated rat hearts that were subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. Intracellular sodium and pH were monitored using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140 (10 nM), was administered with EN in some hearts to determine the effect of bradykinin blockade on EN-mediated effects.", 
    "609": "EN blunted the rise in ischemic intracellular sodium, measured using MRS. With reperfusion, EN-treated hearts recovered 80% of their preischemic ventricular function, compared with negligible recover, in controls. These beneficial effects of EN were blocked when the bradykinin receptor antagonist, HOE 140, was coadministered with EN. HOE 140 also blocked EN-mediated attenuation of ischemic intracellular acidosis.", 
    "610": "These results suggest that EN exerts beneficial effects on ischemic intracellular sodium and pH homeostasis via the bradykinin receptor. These effects of EN may provide a mechanism for the beneficial actions of this agent during ischemia.", 
    "611": "Thermal Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy was used to investigate the conformational isomerization of captopril in the solid state. The result indicates that the IR peak intensity of captopril for original bands decreased dramatically at 102 degrees C, but for new bands it increased with the rise of temperature. The frequency of C=O stretching mode for carboxylic acid and for amide was located at a higher wavenumber of 1747 cm(-1) and at a lower frequency of 1591 cm(-1) as compared with the general compound, suggesting the existence of trans isomer of captopril in the solid state by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Beyond 102 degrees C, several new bands at 1720, 1645, and 1610 cm(-1) were observed with the rise of temperature, indicating the coexistence of a cis isomer. However, the cis isomer could transform gradually to the trans isomer after cooling. The thermodynamics of equilibrium mixture of cis/trans isomers were also studied. The trans isomer was more stable than the cis isomer, but the cis isomer was favored at the higher temperature.", 
    "612": "n 1987 the results of the Consensus study were published, and showed that enalapril, an angiotensin convertor enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), was able to modify the clinical course of the heart failure syndrome thereby reducing mortality. Other ACEI later demonstrated the same effect on the different degrees of symptomatic heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial infarction and more recently in diabetic patients. In 1996 studies on the betablockers carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol showed their efficacy in reducing deaths due to progressive heart impairment and sudden death in chronic heart failure. The RALES study showed that small doses of spironolactone also improved the prognosis on this disease. Digital improves the quality of life but not the survival rate. Only amiodarone (among the antiarrhythmics) reduces sudden death. Other drugs and groups of drugs can not be considered for chronic outpatient treatment of heart failure. Multicenter trials make it possible to obtain scientific evidence for establishing rational treatments. Many groups of patients such as women, elderly people and the more severe cases of the disease are often not included in these trials. Occasionally, multicenter trials are badly designed (CIBIS and MCD), which in the case of betablockers, led to a substantial delay in their administration. Other times, as in the ELITE study, the results were badly interpreted. The knowledge obtained from these studies is slow in reaching patients, with few patients taking betablockers. It is known that most patients do not take the doses found to be effective in multicenter trials.", 
    "613": "In patients with stroke and long-standing hypertension, the autoregulation curve of cerebral blood flow (CBF) shifts toward higher blood pressure levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce blood pressure and shift the autoregulation curve back to normal in hypertensive patients. ACE inhibitors have 2 major pharmacological properties: they inhibit both the production of angiotensin II and the breakdown of kinins. Hence, we investigated whether the effect of an ACE inhibitor on the lower limit of CBF autoregulation is mediated by the potentiation of bradykinin-mediated vasodilatation.", 
    "614": "In 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats, CBF was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry during stepwise controlled hypotension. The lower limit of CBF autoregulation was defined as the mean arterial pressure at which CBF decreased by 20% of the baseline value. The rats were treated with an ACE inhibitor, captopril, in the captopril group; a bradykinin BK2-receptor antagonist, Hoe140, in the Hoe140 group; and both agents in the captopril+Hoe140 group. Other rats served as a control group. The lower limits of CBF autoregulation were compared among the 4 groups.", 
    "615": "In the captopril group, the lower limit of CBF autoregulation was 43+/-8 mm Hg (mean+/-SD), which was significantly lower than that in the control group (57+/-14 mm Hg). Inhibition of bradykinin abolished the effect of captopril on the lower limit of CBF autoregulation. Hoe140 alone had no significant effect on the lower limit of CBF autoregulation.", 
    "616": "These results suggest that the shift of the lower limit of CBF autoregulation by captopril is mediated, at least in part, by bradykinin.", 
    "617": "N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP) is a physiological inhibitor of hematopoiesis that is maintained at stable levels in normal plasma. Its degradation in vivo and in vitro by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) accounts for the high plasma concentrations of AcSDKP in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. Because ACE inhibitors can induce anemia in some patients, we measured plasma AcSDKP concentrations in 176 patients with chronic renal failure: 120 hemodialysis (HD) and 56 nondialysis (nD) patients, 39 of whom were administered ACE inhibitors. We studied the relationships between AcSDKP levels, hematologic parameters, and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in these patients. AcSDKP levels were significantly greater in HD (10.3 +/- 3.9 pmol/mL) and nD (3.1 +/- 1.8 pmol/mL) patients not administered ACE inhibitors than controls (1.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/mL). In all patients, treatment with ACE inhibitors significantly increased these levels fourfold. HD sessions significantly decreased AcSDKP concentrations by 66% and reduced the predialysis in vitro half-life of AcSDKP (270 +/- 109 minutes) to values (182 +/- 67 minutes) not significantly different from those of controls or nD patients. Most HD patients treated with ACE inhibitors had AcSDKP levels greater than 24 pmol/mL (the greatest concentration found in other nD and HD patients). Only in this group of patients did weekly doses of rHuEPO correlate with AcSDKP levels. Our results show that renal function is essential to maintain stable AcSDKP plasma levels, and at high levels, AcSDKP acts as a uremic toxin causing partial resistance to erythropoietin and inhibiting erythropoiesis.", 
    "618": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce urine protein excretion and slow the progression of renal disease. The beneficial effect in slowing the progression of renal disease is greater in patients with higher urine protein excretion at the onset of treatment. We hypothesized that the greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression of renal disease in patients with higher baseline levels of proteinuria is due to their greater antiproteinuric effect in these patients.", 
    "619": "Data were analyzed from 1860 patients enrolled in 11 randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of antihypertensive regimens, including ACE inhibitors to regimens not including ACE inhibitors on the progression of non-diabetic renal disease. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the level of proteinuria at baseline and changes in urine protein excretion during follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the relationship between changes in urine protein excretion during follow-up and the effect of ACE inhibitors on the time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine values or onset of end-stage renal disease.", 
    "620": "Mean (median) baseline urine protein excretion was 1.8 (0.94) g/day. Patients with higher baseline urine protein excretion values had a greater reduction in proteinuria during the follow-up in association with treatment with ACE inhibitors and in association with lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressures (interaction P < 0.001 for all). A higher level of urine protein excretion during follow-up (baseline minus change) was associated with a greater risk of progression [relative risk 5.56 (3.87 to 7.98) for each 1.0 g/day higher protein excretion]. After controlling for the current level of urine protein excretion, the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors remained significant [relative risk for ACE inhibitors vs. control was 0.66 (0.52 to 0.83)], but there was no significant interaction between the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors and the baseline level of urine protein excretion.", 
    "621": "The antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors and lowering blood pressure are greater in patients with a higher baseline urine protein excretion. The greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on renal disease progression in patients with higher baseline proteinuria can be explained by their greater antiproteinuric effects in these patients. The current level of urine protein excretion is a modifiable risk factor for the progression of non-diabetic renal disease. ACE inhibitors provide greater beneficial effect at all levels of current urine protein excretion.", 
    "622": "Previously, we had found that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in the early lifespan of spontaneously hypertensive rat could prevent the development of hypertension in this animal model. In the present study we evaluated the responses of blood pressure and renal function to intracerebroventricular administration of angiotensin II in long-term captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats had been mated and their pups were treated with captopril through drinking water after birth. Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats drinking tap water were used as control groups. At 4 months of age, the basal mean arterial blood pressure of captopril-treated hypertensive rats was the lowest among those of controlled hypertensive and normotensive rats (98+/-5 vs. 160+/-4 and 126+/-4 mmHg, respectively). Intravenous administration of angiotensin II caused similar increments of blood pressure in all rat groups. However, intracerebroventricular administration of angiotensin II to captopril-treated hypertensive rats induced a significantly less increase of arterial blood pressure in comparison with other groups. The sensitivity of baroreflex in captopril-treated hypertensive rats was also the lowest among all rat groups. The basal urine flow, sodium and potassium excretion rates, and osmolar clearance of captopril-treated hypertensive rats were significantly higher than those of controlled hypertensive rats. Intracerebroventricular infusion of angiotensin II caused significant increases in urine flow, electrolytes excretion, osmolar clearance, and free water reabsorption rate of both normotensive and controlled hypertensive rats. However, the same angiotensin II treatment did not change any of the renal excretion indices in captopril-treated hypertensive rats. Our results suggest that lifetime captopril treatment can decrease the activity of the renin-angiotensin system in the brain of hypertensive animals, which caused increases in basal urine flow and excretion of electrolytes and enhanced the sensitivity of baroreflex. It is likely that changes in the renal and baroreflex functions underlie the prevention of hypertension elicited by long-term captopril treatment.", 
    "623": "A newborn girl had chronic renal failure following prenatal exposure to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and a young infant with congenital nephrotic syndrome, showed persistent hypotension with neurological complications following bilateral nephrectomy at the age of 4 months. Both died. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well-known for its regulatory function with respect to blood pressure, renal haemodynamics, fluid balance and electrolyte balance. Furthermore, its role in growth and differentiation of the kidneys and urinary tracts is becoming clearer. The RAS is highly important for the foetus and young infant. Extreme caution should be exercised with prenatal exposure to ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and bilateral nephrectomy in young infants.", 
    "624": "To evaluate the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) on diabetic cardiovascular complications, a streptozotozin (STZ, i.p., 70 mg/kg BW) induced diabetes rat model was used. The animals were separated into four major groups including: control (NSS), STZ-treated rats, STZ-treated rats received daily oral feeding of cilazapril starting one day after STZ injection (STZ-C1), and STZ-treated rats received daily oral feeding of cilazapril eight weeks after the STZ injection (STZ-C8). Within the groups of STZ-C1 and STZ-C8, the animals were also divided into three subgroups of six rats that received different doses of cilazapril treatment, 0.01 mg/Kg BW, 1 mg/Kg BW, and 10 mg/Kg BW. By using the modified isolated heart model, the parameters of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), left ventricular isotonic contraction (LVIC), aortic flow rate (AFR), coronary flow rate (CFR), and ratio of heart weight per body weight (R) were assessed for each groups 8 and 20 weeks after the STZ injections. Moreover, the changes of wall thickness of the left ventricular wall (LV), right ventricular wall (RV), and interventricular septal wall (IVS) were monitored from the scanning electron micrographs of each heart. The results indicated that in both STZ-C1 and STZ-C8, the diabetic hypertension could be prevented or treated by anti-hypertensive doses of cilazaprils. Besides, the values of AFR, CFR, and LVIC were significantly increased when comparing between the STZ and STZ-C1 or STZ-C8. The results of morphological examinations indicated that: (1) left ventricular walls of the three hearts of STZ-rats had increased significantly more than controls. (2) Right ventricular walls and interventricular septal walls were not significantly different among STZ-rats, cilazapril treated STZ-rats and age matched controls. Therefore, it is concluded that ACE-I could act either as a cardioprotective or therapeutic agent for diabetic hearts. Both major anti-hypertension and anti-trophic effects of ACE-I have already been elucidated.",

    "632": "Significant troponin-I release (>0.1 microg/l) was detected in 93 (31%) patients. Pretreatment with ACE inhibitors, recorded in 53 patients (17.6%), independently reduced the odds of troponin-I release (odds ratio 0.25; 95% confidence intervals 0.10 to 0.64) and was associated with lower maximum troponin-I concentrations (median [interquartile range]) compared with patients not pretreated with ACE inhibitors (0.44 microg/l [0.19 to 2.65 microg/l] vs. 4.18 microg/l [0.91 to 12.41 microg/l], p = 0.01). Pretreatment with aspirin, recorded in 173 patients (57.5%), did not significantly reduce the odds of troponin-I release after adjustment but was associated with lower maximum troponin-I concentrations compared with patients not pretreated with aspirin (2.31 microg/l [0.72 to 8.02 microg/l] vs. 5.85 microg/l [1.19 to 12.79 microg/l], p = 0.05).

    "637": "Various growth factors have been proposed to be players in the development of diabetic microvascular complications. In particular, growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have a long history in diabetes, with measurable effects on the development of diabetic kidney disease in experimental animal models through changes in a complex intrarenal system. Furthermore, new data obtained in knock-out (KO) mice with GH receptor (GHR)/GH-binding protein (GHBP) gene disruption have shown that these animals are protected against diabetes-induced renal changes. The recent development of specific inhibitors of GH action, i.e. specific GHR antagonists (GHRAs), has opened the possibility that this group of inhibitors may be used as therapeutic agents in conditions where GH and IGFs have been suggested to play a pathophysiological role, such as late complications of diabetes. Accordingly, new data from studies in diabetic mice treated with a GHRA (G120K-PEG) from the onset of diabetes, showed normalization of the diabetes-associated renal hypertrophy and glomerular enlargement and, most importantly, a lowering effect on the diabetes-induced rise in urinary albumin excretion (UAE), a marker of renal damage. In addition, late intervention with GHRAs alone or in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in non-obese diabetic mice with manifest renal changes, showed regression in some of the diabetes-associated renal changes (e.g. UAE and renal hypertrophy). These experimental data strongly suggest that GHR blockade may present a new concept in the treatment of diabetic renal complications. Future studies are warranted to characterize fully the clinical potential of GHRAs as drugs for treatment of diabetic complications in general.",

Although carvedilol has been marketed in Canada since 1999, metoprolol succinate has yet to be marketed there, so the price is unknown. Therefore we input a Canadian price based on the price ratio of the 2 drugs in the United States.",

The expected costs (in 1999 Canadian dollars) are $8,989, $13,833, and $18,114, respectively. This yields incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for metoprolol relative to conventional therapy alone of $4,140 per life-year gained, and for carvedilol relative to metoprolol, the ICER is $8,394 per life-year gained.", 
    "641": "In addition to conventional therapy with furosemide and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, treatment with either metoprolol or carvedilol confers a survival benefit that is attractive from a cost-effectiveness point of view. Until better information becomes available, it is not possible to distinguish between the two beta-blockers on the basis of cost-effectiveness. This means that the choice of beta-blockers for HF should be based largely on clinical considerations because both beta-blockers prolong life at relatively low cost.",

Patients with diabetes were less likely to be dispensed a beta-blocker, as were younger and female patients. Previous visits to a cardiologist decreased the likelihood of receiving combination therapy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors but increased that of using calcium antagonists. Apart from dose adjustment, 89% of study subjects underwent at least 1 modification to their initial regimen, at a median time of 134 days. After 1 year, only 33.8% of patients were still using their initial drug. An early decrease in the proportion of patients continuing to receive initial therapy was noted, especially among beta-blocker users.",

Arterial blood pressure (BP), frequency of angina pain attacks, standard submaximal bicycle exercise test (BET), echocardiography, ADP-induced platelet aggregation (PA), levels of cholesterol (CH), lipid peroxidation products, intracellular Ca, Ca(++)-ATPase activity were studied before and 2 weeks, 2, 6 and 12 months after captopril therapy in 68 males aged 35-58 years with moderate EH in combination with CHD, stable angina of effort and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (57.5 +/- 1.2%).",

Left ventricular hypertrophy regression was not registered. Of all the platelet parameters only Ca(++)-ATPase, Ca and malonic dialdehyde (MDA) beneficial changes persisted for 12 month treatment period: Ca(++)-ATPase activity increased, Ca and MDA content reduced. The other platelet parameters were less persistent. BP lowering correlated with Ca(++)-ATPase, CH, MDA and PA changes whereas the number of anginal pain attack correlated with CH and PA reduction.", 
    "650": "A beneficial effect of captopril on BP persisted for 12 months, on angina symptoms--for 6 months. One of the mechanisms of antihypertensive and antianginal effect of captopril is attributed to platelet alterations correction.", 
    "651": "Bayesian modeling offers an elegant approach to meta-analysis that efficiently incorporates all sources of variability and relevant quantifiable external information. It provides a more informative summary of the likely value of parameters after observing the data than do non-Bayesian approaches. This leads to direct probabilistic inference about model parameters such as the average treatment effect, the between-study variance, and individual study treatment effects. The latter are weighted averages of the common mean and individual study means with weights reflecting the amount of information provided by each study relative to the others. Homogeneity among these posterior study estimates indicates that pooling these studies is appropriate; heterogeneity suggests that some cause of between-study variation should be explored. The author describes the construction of such models and shows how to use them to estimate a common mean and regression slopes. Two examples illustrate the additional inferences available with the Bayesian methodology.",

Nine patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of > 95 mmHg and < 105 mmHg at the end of a 4-week placebo run-in period entered the double-blind phase of the study, which consisted of three 6-week periods during which patients were treated with placebo, enalapril (20 mg o.d.) or losartan (50 mg o.d.) The de novo synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein in PBMC was measured by [3H]-thymidine, [3H]-uridine or [3H]-leucine incorporation, respectively. Neither enalapril nor losartan affected the proliferation of PBMC measured as de novo synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein. Our data show that proliferation was not affected during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril and angiotensin receptor type 1 antagonism with losartan.", 
    "653": "Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats was monitored by measuring the motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and histopathology of the tibial nerve. Pretreatment with lisinopril (2 mg/kg p.o., 5 days prior to STZ and continued for 10 weeks) significantly (p < 0.01) prevented deterioration of MNCV as compared to STZ-diabetic animals. Nerve sections from the lisinopril pretreated group revealed less structural damage as compared to STZ-diabetic rats. However lisinopril had no effect on blood sugar, i.e., it did not alter the diabetic state. It is concluded that lisinopril prevents the development of experimental diabetic neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats.", 
    "654": "In confirmatory randomized clinical trials that are designed to compare multiple doses of a test treatment with a control group and with one another, there are often statistical issues regarding compound hypotheses and multiple comparisons which need to be considered. In most cases the analysis plan needs a clear specification for the proposed order for conducting statistical tests (or for managing the overall significance level), which statistical methods will be used, and whether adjustment for covariates will be performed. There are several benefits of specifying non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for performing the primary confirmatory analyses. Only minimal assumptions are needed beyond randomization in the study design, whereas regression model based methods have assumptions about model fit for which departures may require modifications that are incompatible with a fully prespecified analysis plan. Non-parametric methods provide traditionally expected results of ANCOVA; namely, a typically small adjustment to the estimate for a treatment comparison (so as to account for random imbalance of covariates between treatment groups) and variance reduction for this estimate when covariates are strongly correlated with the response of interest. The application of non-parametric ANCOVA is illustrated for two randomized clinical trials. The first has a (3 x 4) factorial response surface design for the comparison of 12 treatments (that is, combinations of three doses of one drug and four doses of a second drug) for change in blood pressure; and the second example addresses the comparison of three doses of test treatment and placebo for time-to-disease progression. This clinical trial has comparisons among treatments made for a dichotomous criterion, Wilcoxon rank scores and averages of cumulative survival rates. In each example, the non-parametric covariance method provides variance reduction relative to its unadjusted counterpart.",

This study examined the relative bioavailability of enalapril suspension (10 mg) (S) compared with 10-mg marketed VASOTEC tablets (T) in 16 healthy adult subjects. The geometric mean ratio (S/T) estimate of urinary recovery of free enalaprilat, the active moiety, was 0.92 (90% confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 1.07). Urinary recovery data indicate that approximately 50% of the dose was absorbed (50% recovered in urine as enalapril plus enalaprilat) with about 30% of the dose recovered as free enalaprilat for both S and T. The geometric mean ratios (S/T) of serum AUC and C(max) were 1.01 (90% CI: 0.90, 1.13) and 0.98 (90% CI: 0.83, 1.16), respectively. Suspension T(max) was slightly shorter (0.5 h) than that for tablet, but this difference is not clinically significant. Both formulations were well tolerated and there were no clinically significant adverse experiences. We conclude that the bioavailability of enalapril oral suspension 10-mg is similar to that of VASOTEC 10-mg tablet. Instructions for compounding enalapril are provided.",

Proteinuria was more marked amongst I-FSG (6.5+/-4.2 g/24 h) and most of them developed oedema and biochemical nephrotic syndrome. Glomerulomegaly was observed in all renal biopsies from OB-FSG patients (mean glomerular diameter 256+/-24 microm in OB-FSG vs 199+/-26 microm in I-FSG, P<0.001). Twelve OB-FSG patients (80%) were treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and proteinuria significantly decreased within the first 6 months of treatment but showed a later increase. None of the obese patients achieved a sustained weight loss. Seven (46%) patients with OB-FSG experienced a progressive renal insufficiency and five of them started intermittent dialysis. Kaplan-Meier estimated probabilities of renal survival after 5 and 10 years were 77 and 51%, respectively, in OB-FSG patients, and 52 and 30% in I-FSG (P<0.05).

Because changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) components are often associated with such cellular remodeling, we studied the adipocyte expression of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, two key enzymes involved in the modulation of ECM. The present study provides the first evidence that human adipose tissue produces and secretes MMP-2 and -9 as shown by gelatin zymography analysis performed on media conditioned by human subcutaneous adipose tissue and human preadipocytes in primary cultures and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis on transcripts from mature human adipocytes. The further characterization performed on the murine 3T3F442A preadipocyte cell line demonstrates that MMP expression, assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, as well as activity, assessed by gelatin zymography analysis, increased during the adipocyte differentiation, whereas the expression of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases 1 and 2 were abolished or not affected, respectively. Finally, preadipocyte treatment with MMP inhibitors such as batimastat and captopril, as well as neutralizing antibodies, markedly decreased adipocyte differentiation as demonstrated by the inhibition in the appearance of lipogenic (triglycerides) and lipolytic (glycerol release and hormone-sensitive lipase expression) markers. These data suggest that MMP-2 and -9 could be important key regulators of adipocyte differentiation. Thus, the adipocyte-derived MMPs might represent a new target for the inhibition of adipose tissue growth.", 
    "665": "1. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) improves symptoms and prognosis in heart failure. The experimental basis for these benefits remains unclear. We examined the effects of inhibition of ACE or blockade of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor on the haemodynamics, cardiac G-proteins, and collagen synthesis of rats with coronary artery ligation (CAL), a model in which chronic heart failure (CHF) is induced. 2. Rats were orally treated with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril (3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or the AT1 receptor blocker L-158809 (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) from the 2nd to 8th week after CAL. CAL resulted in decreases in the left ventricular systolic pressure and its positive and negative dP/dt, an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and the rightward shift of the left ventricular pressure-volume curve. Long-term treatment with either drug improved these signs of CHF to a similar degree. 3. Cardiac Gsalpha and Gqalpha protein levels decreased, whereas the level of Gialpha protein increased in the animals with CHF. Long-term treatment with trandolapril or L-158809 attenuated the increase in the level of cardiac Gialpha protein of the animals with CHF without affecting Gsalpha and Gqalpha protein levels. Cardiac collagen content of the failing heart increased, whose increase was blocked by treatment with either drug. 4. Exogenous angiotensin I stimulated collagen synthesis in cultured cardiac fibroblasts, whose stimulation was attenuated by either drug. 5. These results suggest that blockade of the RAS, at either the receptor level or the synthetic enzyme level, may attenuate the cardiac fibrosis that occurs after CAL and thus affect the remodelling of the failing heart.",

Of 48 patients with biopsy-proven FSGS, 30 had pre-therapy and follow-up evaluations of proteinuria. Of these, 22 were nephrotic (> or = 3 g protein/24 h). Twelve/22 were treated with S and 10/22 with ACEI +/- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) alone. 92% of S patients received ACEI during follow-up, 83% concurrently with steroid treatment. The two cohorts (S vs. ACEI) were not different in age (34 +/- 12 vs. 33 +/- 12), sex (75% vs. 78% male), or ethnicity (83% vs. 83% African American). Mean follow-up time was 16 (range 4 - 61 months) vs. 23 months (range 6 - 56 months). Mean S dose was 70 mg qd (range 60 - 100 mg), with mean treatment duration of 4 months. Nephrotic patients were compared with regard to degree of proteinuria at follow-up. There were no complete remissions (proteinuria < or = 200 mg/24 h) in either group. There was no difference in partial remissions (> 200 mg to < 3 g proteinuria/24 h) between the two groups - 5/12 vs. 6/10 (p = 0.434). There was no difference in the proportion of patients progressing to ESRD. Although proteinuria decreased significantly with time in both groups, there was no significant treatment effect. There was no significant time or treatment effect on serum creatinine. Mean arterial pressure and serum cholesterol were not significantly different between the groups.

Captopril (50 mg/l in drinking water, 4 weeks) raised the myocardial content of glycogen. After 25-min global ischemia, captopril treatment, compared with the controls, resulted in lower rates of lactate dehydrogenase release during reperfusion (8.58 +/- 1.12 vs. 13.39 +/- 1.88 U/heart/30 min, p<0.05), lower myocardial lactate contents (11.34 +/- 0.93 vs. 21.22 +/- 4.28 micromol/g d.w., p<0.05) and higher coronary flow recovery (by 25%), and prevented the decrease of NO release into the perfusate during reperfusion. In control hearts L-arginine added to the perfusate (1 mmol/l) 10 min before ischemia had no effect on the parameters evaluated under our experimental conditions, presumably because of sufficient saturation of the myocardium with L-arginine. In the hearts of captopril-treated rats, L-arginine further increased NO production during reperfusion and the cGMP content before ischemia. Our results have shown that long-term captopril treatment increases the energy potential and has a beneficial effect on tolerance of the isolated heart to ischemia. L-arginine added into the perfusate potentiates the effect of captopril on the NO signaling pathway.",

Here we study Erm and Pea3, two ETS domain transcription factors, and show that their expression correlates closely with the domains of fgf8 and fgf3 expression. In situ hybridization analysis in wild-type and acerebellar (ace) mutant embryos defective for fgf8 demonstrates a requirement of Fgf8 for normal expression levels of erm and pea3 transcripts in and close to various domains of Fgf8 action, including the prospective midbrain-hindbrain region, the somites, the neural crest, the forebrain, and developing eyes. Morpholino-oligomer-assisted gene knock-down experiments targeted against fgf8 and fgf3 suggest that Fgf3 and Fgf8 are co-regulators of these genes in the early forebrain anlage. Furthermore, inhibition of Fgf signaling by overexpression of sprouty4 or application of the Fgf inhibitor SU5402 leads to a loss of all erm and pea3 expression domains. Conversely, ectopically provided fgf3 mRNA or implanted beads coated with Fgf8 elicit ectopic transcription of erm and pea3. Both activation and loss of transcripts can be observed within short time frames. We conclude that both the transcriptional onset and maintenance of these factors are tightly coupled to Fgf signaling and propose that erm and pea3 transcription is a direct readout of cells to Fgf levels. Given the knowledge that has accumulated on the posttranslational control of ETS domain factors and their combinatorial interactions with other transcription factors, we suggest that the close coupling of erm and pea3 transcription to Fgf signaling might serve to integrate Fgf signaling with other signals to establish refined patterns in embryonic development.",

Endothelial dysfunction includes abnormalities of vasomotor tone (constriction and dilation), balance between fibrinolysis and thrombosis, control of the inflammatory response, and growth of vascular smooth muscle. Cardiovascular prevention interventions have been studied extensively and there are considerable data supporting a beneficial effect on endothelial dysfunction. The interventions that are clearly effective in improving endothelial function are diet and lipid-lowering therapy (especially with statin drugs), use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, hormone replacement therapy, vitamin E, and proper physical exercise.

An indirect in-vivo assessment of whole body vascular hypertrophy (mean arterial pressure during maximum vasoconstriction) was made during and after drug withdrawal, as was the pressor activity evoked by angiotensin I and angiotensin II. The effect of antihypertensive treatment on microalbuminuria was also assessed during and after drug withdrawal.

Vascular hypertrophy, measured indirectly and directly, was also reduced by all three treatments, with perindopril and candesartan cilexetil causing hypotrophic and eutrophic remodelling, respectively (treatment study), although these changes were generally not maintained after drug withdrawal (withdrawal study). Angiotensin I-induced pressor responses were equally inhibited during treatment with either candesaran cilexetil or perindopril (and were unaffected by hydralazine) but normalized rapidly in both groups (within approximately 2-4 days) after withdrawal of RAS inhibition.

Both types of RAS inhibition and hydralazine caused marked cardiac and vascular remodelling during treatment, whereas only the RAS inhibitors persistently regressed cardiac hypertrophy 8 weeks later. Collectively, these results indicate the importance of the RAS for the maintenance of hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy in adult SHR, as well as identifying differential effects of ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade on persistent blood pressure reduction.",

In both groups, treated hypertensives had medications adjusted downward, while untreated hypertensives were started on a diuretic and/or ACE inhibitor and adjustments were made upward.

In both groups, pressures of previously treated patients increased over the 3 months, while those that were previously untreated declined. However, this difference, to some extent, might be expected because the acceptable limit of pressure control (150 / 90 mmHg) was higher than many of the patients on medications; thus, their pressures could increase and still be considered controlled. Those patients who were previously untreated had their pressures decreased only to this level. The nurse-measured clinic blood pressures for the 'home' group began higher than that of the 'clinic' group and remained higher at the end of the study. Average home pressures of the 'home' group were consistently lower than nurse-measured clinic pressures over the 3-month study period, indicating a persistent 'white coat' effect.

    "711": "A number of studies suggest that erythropoietin (Ep), angiotensin II, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) are involved in the pathogenesis of posttransplantation erythrocytosis (PTE). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are the treatment of choice in PTE, but their mechanism of action is unclear. It was shown previously that ACEI added directly to cultures of erythroid precursors from patients with PTE inhibit colony growth. In this report, the effect of ACEI on CD34+ erythroid precursor apoptosis was studied, as were hematocrit (Hct), Ep, IGF-1, and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) levels. Ten patients with PTE, 10 transplant control patients, and 7 normal control subjects were studied. Peripheral blood CD34+ cells were isolated, and apoptosis was assessed by annexin assay and DNA laddering before and during ACEI therapy. At the same time, Hct, Ep, IGF-1, and IGF-BP3 levels were measured. Baseline CD34+ cell number, CD34+ apoptosis, Ep, IGF-1, and IGF-BP3 levels were the same between PTE and transplant control subjects. ACEI therapy was associated with a striking increase in CD34+ cell apoptosis and a decrease in Hct in both groups. In contrast to control subjects, patients with PTE on ACEI showed a significant decrease in IGF-1 levels and a greater percentage decrease in Hct. In normal control subjects, ACEI therapy was associated with a fall in Hct but no change in CD34+ cell apoptosis. In PTE, ACEI-related increase in erythroid progenitor apoptosis may partially explain the ACEI-associated decrease in Hct. However, it is not clear that erythroid precursor apoptosis is related to changes in IGF-1 or IGF-BP3.", 
    "712": "Interaction of reactive oxygen species with nitric oxide promotes nitric oxide inactivation and generation of cytotoxic reactive nitrogen species that attack DNA, lipids, and proteins. Nitration of free tyrosine and tyrosine residues of proteins results in production of nitrotyrosine, which can lead to excitotoxicity and frequently is found in the brain of patients and animals with various degenerative, ischemic, toxic, and other neurologic disorders. According to earlier studies, reactive oxygen species activity is increased and neuronal NO synthase expression in the brain is elevated in animals with chronic renal failure (CRF). It was hypothesized, therefore, that tyrosine nitration must be increased in the uremic brain. This hypothesis was tested, through determination of nitrotyrosine abundance (by Western blot analysis), as well as distribution (by immunohistology), in the cerebrum of rats with CRF 6 wk after 5/6 nephrectomy. The results were compared with those of sham-operated controls and antioxidant (lazaroid)-treated and captopril-treated rats with CRF. Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in nitrotyrosine abundance in the cerebral cortex of rats with CRF. This was accompanied by an intense nitrotyrosine staining of the neuronal processes, including proximal segments of dendrites, axons, and axon terminals of the cortical neurons. Both antioxidant therapy and captopril administration alleviated oxidative stress (as evidenced by normalization of plasma lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde) and significantly reduced nitrotyrosine abundance in the cerebral cortex of the treated CRF group. In conclusion, CRF resulted in oxidative stress and increased tyrosine nitration in the cerebral cortex. Antioxidant therapy and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition alleviated the CRF-induced oxidative stress and mitigated tyrosine nitration in the rats with CRF.", 
    "713": "The nature of protein breakdown products and peptidomimetic drugs such as beta-lactams is crucial for their transmembrane transport across apical enterocyte membranes, which is accomplished by the pH-dependent high-capacity oligopeptide transporter PEPT1. To visualize oligopeptide transporter-mediated uptake of oligopeptides, an ex vivo assay using the fluorophore-conjugated dipeptide derivative D-Ala-Lys-N(epsilon)-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (D-Ala-Lys-AMCA) was established in the murine small intestine and compared with immunohistochemistry for PEPT1 in murine and human small intestine. D-Ala-Lys-AMCA was accumulated by enterocytes throughout all segments of the murine small intestine, with decreasing intensity from the top to the base of the villi. Goblet cells did not show specific uptake. Inhibition studies revealed competitive inhibition by the beta-lactam cefadroxil, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the dipeptide glycyl-glutamine. Controls were performed using either the inhibitor diethylpyrocarbonate or an incubation temperature of 4 degrees C to exclude unspecific uptake. Immunohistochemistry for PEPT1 localized immunoreactivity to the enterocytes, with the highest intensity at the apical membrane. This is the first study that visualizes dipeptide transport across the mammalian intestine and indicates that uptake assays using D-Ala-Lys-AMCA might be useful for characterizing PEPT1-specific substrates or inhibitors.",

In open-chest pentobarbitone anaesthetized cats, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 15 min followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Vehicle (saline) or captopril (4 mg kg(-1)) was administered 10 min before instituting ischaemia (pre-treatment) or 5 min before reperfusion (post-treatment). In the vehicle-treated group, ischaemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) was evidenced by enhanced plasma renin activity, depression of global haemodynamic function (mean arterial pressure, left ventricular-end-diastolic-pressure, peak positive and negative dP/dt) along with depletion of myocardial high energy phosphate (HEP) compounds. Oxidant stress in IRI was evidenced by raised levels of myocardial thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and depletion of endogenous myocardial antioxidants (glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase). Pre-treatment with captopril prevented (i) loss of myocardial haemodynamic function, (ii) rise in TBARS and (iii) depletion of myocardial HEP compounds. However, in the post-treatment group, only partial recovery of myocardial haemodynamic function, with no significant reduction in TBARS, was observed. Glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase were unaffected by either treatment schedules. The results of the present study suggest that captopril is more effective in attenuating ischaemic-reperfusion injury when administered before ischaemia rather than before reperfusion.",

Diuretics were used in only 13.2% of the prescriptions. Atenolol (36%), amlodipine (29.3%) and enalapril (19%) were the most frequently used individual drugs.

    "722": "If hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus type II is not adequately controlled by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i), a beta-blocker is frequently added as second-line therapy. Recently, large randomized trials demonstrated the beneficial effect of second-generation dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers in these patients. These compounds are increasingly being used to replace beta-blockers. Withdrawal of beta-blockers may influence diabetic control and may cause rebound hypertension. Any rebound hypertension from beta-blocker withdrawal may not occur if the beta-blocker is replaced with a calcium-channel blocker. A calcium-channel blocker will influence vascular resistance (VR) and blood pressure differently than a beta-blocker. Thirty-four patients with diabetes mellitus type II and a resting diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg despite enalapril 10 mg daily (or equipotent dosages of other ACE-i) for at least 3 months were treated in an open label sequential comparison with the same ACE-i in combination with the beta-blocker metoprolol 100 mg for 3 months, and, subsequently for 3 more months with the same ACE-i in combination with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker lercanidipine 10 mg once daily. After 6 weeks, patients with a diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg were titrated up to 200 mg metoprolol or 20 mg lercanidipine once daily. Patients were examined every 6 weeks during the trial, and after 2 weeks while receiving lercanidipine. In addition to blood pressure measurements, VR was measured by iridium strain gauge plethysmography and expressed in units (1 unit = 1 mm Hg/mL blood/100 mL tissue per minute). Two of 34 patients did not complete the protocol because of non-compliance with the lercanidipine treatment in the first 2 weeks of treatment. Their data are included in the analysis. No rebound hypertension 14 days after the change-over of therapies was observed. (Mean arterial pressures [MAPs] were not significantly different from the point of withdrawal of the beta-blockers.) However, heart rate rose from 69+/-7 to 94+/-10 beats/min (p < 0.001). After 3 months on lercanidipine, MAP fell by 6+/-10 mm Hg (p = 0.002) compared to the point of withdrawal of the beta-blocker. Vascular resistance fell by 6.28+/-11.91 units (p<0.01), while glucosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) rose by 0.4+/-0.5% (p<0.001) and body weight rose by 0.6+/-0.6 kg (p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations between decrease in VR, increase in HbAlc, and decrease in MAP, and partial dependence of these variables on one another. In hypertensive patients with diabetes type II, replacement of ACE-i and metoprolol with ACE-i and lercanidipine does not appreciably influence metabolic control and does not cause rebound hypertension. Lercanidipine was more effective than metoprolol as a second-line antihypertensive drug in these patients. At least two mechanisms may be involved: withdrawal of a pressor effect from the beta-blocker, and calcium-channel-mediated vasodilation.",

    "727": "This review updates some recent advances of a new and exciting developments in basic and clinical cardiology: a) the role, in the congestive heart failure (CHF), of the neurohumoral systems (NHS) which act to maintain circulatory homeostatic equilibrium, and b) the therapeutic implications of such a role. Six NHS, acting in CHF, have presently been identified: three of them induce vasoconstriction and sodium retention (sympathetic nervous systems, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and arginine-vasopressine system); the remaining three offset or balance the former ones, acting, therefore as \"counterregulators\" (prostaglandins--PGE2 and PGI2--, dopaminergic system and atrial natriuretic factor). Each one of these NHS influences the \"compensatory\" mechanisms of heart failure, acting on the target-organs both by direct effects and by interaction with other NHS; consequently, in heart failure, all the NHS are stimulated with the respective increase in the plasma levels of their active agents. In asymptomatic stages of ventricular dysfunction the stimulation of the vasodilator-and-natriuretic systems appears to be predominant and able to maintain circulatory equilibrium. However, as the heart dysfunction increases and becomes symptomatic, the vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining forces appear to predominate; this phenomenon becomes increasingly apparent as the functional class becomes more advanced. The hyperstimulation of these last systems has an extremely important role in the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure, as well as in its prognosis. Therefore, the attempts to correct these neurohormonal imbalance in patients with heart failure has a sound rational basis, not only to improve the symptoms and the exercise capacity but also to increase the survival of these patients. At the present time, amongst the potential pharmacological interventions acting on NHS in CHF, the blockade of the RAA system with ACE-inhibitors is generally accepted as the most feasible, the safest and the most effective therapeutic tool. In fact, its application has broadened from an earlier use in severe CHF to other symptomatic stages of cardiac failure, including the milder forms. In addition, preliminary data strongly suggest its unique usefulness in asymptomatic phase of ventricular dysfunction. Looking back at the medical therapy of heart failure, in can be concluded that we are starting a new era. Throughout 200 years (since the introduction of digitalis) the therapeutic goal in CHF has been the improvement of symptoms. With the developments of the present decade, a new and exciting goal is being offered to these patients, called by Packer \"the second frontier\", that is, the prolongation of their lives.",

ACE inhibitor (ACEI) may have beneficial effects in treating PAH, but its precise mechanism of action in the remodeling process is unclear. p21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that may have a protective role in this process by inhibiting cellular proliferation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) has also been shown to be protective by its vasodilatory effect. Therefore, we investigated whether expression of p21 and eNOS was modulated by ACEI treatment in a rat model.",

After 5 weeks, MRI showed right ventricular hypertrophy in MCT(+)/ACEI(-) rats. MCT(+)/ACEI(+) rats showed a preserved right ventricular morphology. Isolated pulmonary perfusion studies showed that ACEI significantly upregulated NO production, as measured by nitrite levels. Addition of N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate-Fe solution, an NO-trapping agent, reversed the basal vasodilatory effect of ACEI in the pulmonary vasculature.

Rabbits were untreated, or they received the ACE inhibitor ramipril with or without bradykinin B(1) and B(2) receptor blockers or the angiotensin (Ang) II type I (AT(1)) receptor blocker losartan. Pulmonary artery banding caused right ventricular hypertrophy, depressed papillary muscle contractility, and loss of Ang II contractile effects because of a signaling defect downstream of AT(1) receptors. Paradoxically, AT(1) receptor density and G protein alpha subunits alphaq and alphai1/2 increased. Inotropic responsiveness to the alpha-receptor agonist phenylephrine was normal. Ramipril preserved cardiac contractility, but this effect was attenuated by simultaneous use of kinin receptor blockers. Ramipril also maintained responsiveness to Ang II and prevented AT(1) receptor and G protein upregulation. The simultaneous use of a kinin receptor blocker attenuated but did not prevent upregulation in the AT(1) receptor and G protein. Losartan had no effect on baseline contractility, but it maintained cardiac inotropic responsiveness to Ang II, prevented upregulation of AT(1) receptors, but did not modify G protein upregulation.", 
    "733": "Pressure overload of the right ventricle decreases contractility, uncouples AT(1) receptors to downstream signaling pathways, and changes the expression of components of the AT(1) receptor signaling pathway.

The present study investigated if similar mechanisms underlie the angiogenesis induced by short-term exercise training. Seven days before training and throughout the training period, male Sprague-Dawley rats received either captopril or losartan in their drinking water. Rats underwent a 3-day treadmill training protocol. The tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were harvested under anesthesia and lightly fixed in formalin (vessel density) or frozen in liquid nitrogen (VEGF expression). In controls, treadmill training resulted in a significant increase in vessel density in all muscles studied. However, the angiogenesis induced by exercise was completely blocked by either losartan or captopril. Western blot analysis showed that VEGF expression was increased in the exercised control group, and both losartan and captopril blocked this increase. The role of VEGF was directly confirmed using a VEGF-neutralizing antibody. These results confirm the role of angiotensin II and VEGF in angiogenesis induced by exercise.",

A sequential study, diuresis renography or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor renography can be performed to evaluate the changes in renal function induced by the diuretics or ACE inhibitors.

We here examined the effect of the combination of an ACE inhibitor, temocaprilat, an AT1 receptor antagonist, CV-11974 and/or a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, on the myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion by using phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) in Langendorff rabbit hearts. After normothermic 20 min global ischemia, postischemic reperfusion of 30 min was carried out. Twenty-one hearts were divided into three experimental groups consisting of 7 hearts each: a Tem+CV group perfused with a combination of temocaprilat and CV-11974; a Tem+CV+L-NAME group perfused with a combination of temocaprilat and CV-11974 plus L-NAME, and a control group. During ischemia, both the Tem+CV group and Tem+CV+L-NAME group showed a significant inhibition of the decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) compared with the control group (p<0.01); the increase in ATP was 50+/-3%, 42+/-4%, and 19+/-4% in the Tem+CV group, Tem+CV+L-NAME group, and control group, respectively. Both experimental groups also showed a significant inhibition of the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) compared with the control group (p<0.01). After postischemic reperfusion, the Tem+CV group and Tem+CV+L-NAME group again showed a significant improvement of ATP as compared with the control group (p<0.01); the increase in ATP was 73+/-3%, 64+/-3%, and 47+/-4% in the Tem+CV group, Tem+CV+L-NAME group, and control group, respectively, and a significant decrease of LVEDP as compared with the control group (p<0.01). There were no differences in ATP, or LVEDP during ischemia and reperfusion between the Tem+CV group and Tem+CV+ L-NAME group.

Given the seeming importance of the etiology of chronic renal insufficiency in determining drug efficacy, we limited our study to 20 patients with a single common condition, benign nephrosclerosis. The average age of the patients was 62+/-4 years old. The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the course of the study year revealed a similar reduction with cilnidipine and benazepril. Both cilnidipine and benazepril induced similar reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the course of the study year. The baseline levels of serum creatinine were 1.40+/-0.2 mg/dl and urinary excretion of albumin was 168+/-10 mg daily. The levels of serum creatinine were not significantly changed throughout the study in either group, although the levels of urinary excretion of albumin were significantly decreased in both groups.

The main barrier to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in treating heart failure was GPs' concerns about their possible adverse effects.",

    "757": "The present study was carried out to investigate changes in the expression of aquaporins (AQPs) in the peritoneum. The effects of the renin-angiotensin system on the expression of AQPs with and without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1a receptor blocker (ARB) were then examined. We divided 20 male Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats into four groups, dialyzed with these solutions: saline; 10% glucose (TZ); 10% glucose plus benazepril (ACEI: 4 mg/kg daily); and 10% glucose plus valsartan (ARB: 10 mg/kg daily). The ACEI and ARB were administered into the peritoneum for 7 days. Expression of AQP-1-AQP-4 mRNA was studied by semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Ultrafiltration volume (UFV) and peritoneal function were measured by peritoneal equilibration test (PET). In the TZ group, expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 was enhanced in parallel with an increment in UFV. Expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 was also observed in the mesothelium by immunofluorescence microscopy. On the other hand, in ACEI- and ARB-treated rats, expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 was significantly suppressed, accompanied by loss of UFV. Our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of water transport in the peritoneum. Administration of ACEI or ARB in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis should be carried out with caution.",

    "761": "Mild heart failure is characterized by increases in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the absence of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Vasopeptidase (VP) inhibitors are novel molecules that coinhibit neutral endopeptidase 24.11, which degrades the natriuretic peptides (NPs) and ACE. In a well-characterized canine model of mild heart failure produced by ventricular pacing at 180 bpm for 10 days, we defined the renal and humoral actions of acute VP inhibition with omapatrilat (OMA, n=6) and acute ACE inhibition (n=5) alone with fosinoprilat. We also sought to determine whether the NPs participate in the renal actions of acute VP inhibition by the administration of OMA together with an intrarenal administration of the NP receptor antagonist HS-142-1 (n=5). OMA resulted in a greater natriuretic response than did ACE inhibition in association with increases in plasma cGMP, ANP, BNP, urinary cGMP, urinary ANP excretion, and glomerular filtration rate (P<0.05 for OMA versus ACE inhibition). Plasma renin activity was increased only in the group subjected to ACE inhibition. Administration of intrarenal HS-142-1 attenuated the renal properties of OMA in association with a decrease in urinary cGMP excretion despite similar increases in plasma ANP and BNP. This study provides new insight into a unique new pharmacological agent that has beneficial renal actions in experimental mild heart failure beyond the actions that are observed with ACE inhibition alone and that are linked to the NP system.", 
    "762": "Angiotensin (Ang) receptor blockers (ARBs) increase bradykinin (BK) by antagonizing Ang II at its type 1 (AT(1)) receptors and diverting Ang II to its counterregulatory type 2 (AT(2)) receptors. Because the effect of ARBs on BK is constrained by the short half-life of BK and because ACE inhibitors block the degradation of BK, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that an ACE inhibitor can potentiate ARB-induced increases in renal interstitial fluid (RIF) BK levels. We used a microdialysis technique to recover BK and cGMP in vivo from the RIF of sodium-depleted, conscious Sprague-Dawley rats infused for 60 minutes with the AT(1) receptor blocker valsartan (0.17 mg/kg per minute), with the active metabolite of the ACE inhibitor benazepril (benazeprilate, 0.05 mg/kg per minute), or with the specific AT(2) receptor blocker PD 123,319 (50 microg/kg per minute) alone or combined. Each animal served as its own control. RIF BK and cGMP levels increased significantly over 1 hour in response to valsartan, benazeprilate, or both but not to a vehicle control (P<0.01). The combined benazeprilate-valsartan effect was greater than the sum of their individual effects, suggesting potentiation rather than addition, and was abolished by PD 123,319. We demonstrate for the first time that an ACE inhibitor (benazepril) and an ARB (valsartan) potentiate each other, and we postulate that such combinations may be beneficial in clinical states marked by Ang II elevation, such as chronic heart failure, postinfarction left ventricular dysfunction, and hypertension.", 
    "763": "Dry cough is the most common limiting factor of ACE inhibitor (ACEI) use. Generation of NO, a proinflammatory substance on bronchial epithelial cells, is increased by ACEI. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we tested the hypothesis that supplementing iron, an inhibitor of NO synthase, may reduce the cough associated with ACEI use. The subjects were 19 patients who had developed ACEI-induced cough. After a 2-week observation period, they were randomized to a daily morning dose of either 256-mg ferrous sulfate as a tablet or placebo for a treatment period of 4 weeks. The subjects were requested to fill out a cough diary by scoring the daily severity of the cough on a scale of 0 to 4. Mean daily cough scores for the last week of the observation and treatment period were compared. Changes in blood cell count and serum iron and ferritin concentration between the 2 periods were evaluated. Mean daily cough scores during the observation and treatment periods were 3.07+/-0.70 and 1.69+/-1.10, respectively, for the iron group and 2.57+/-0.80 and 2.35+/-1.22, respectively, for the placebo group, showing a significant reduction in cough scores with iron supplementation (P<0.01) but not with placebo. Three subjects in the iron group showed almost complete cough abolition. No significant changes in laboratory data were observed in either group. In conclusion, iron supplementation successfully decreases ACEI-induced cough. This effect may be related to the decrease of NO generation associated with the inhibition of NO synthase activity in bronchial epithelial cells.",

Plasma protein extravasation (PE) was assayed by measurement of extravasated Evans blue dye (microg/g dry tissue). Intravenous injection of substance P (SP, 10 nmol/kg) significantly increased PE in the urinary bladder. PE evoked by SP was increased significantly by quercetin (20 mg/kg, p.o.) pretreatment in the urinary bladder (73.5 +/- 4.9 to 152.2 +/- 9.9). Pretreatment with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (10 nmol/kg, i.v.), or with phosphoramidon, a neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor (2.5 micromol/kg, i.v.) also potentiated the SP-induced PE in urinary bladder, 286.2 +/- 20.4 and 323.3 +/- 34.0, respectively. Quercetin did not show any effect on neurokinin-A (NKA, 10 nmol/kg, i.v.) -induced plasma extravasation. The present study demonstrates that quercetin potentiates the PE induced by substance P in the urinary bladder. These effects suggest that this flavonoid might cause inhibition of NEP and/or ACE.", 
    "780": "1. In chickens, low Na+ diets markedly decrease the hexose transport in the rectal segment of the large intestine; transport in the ileum shows a lower, but significant reduction and transport in the jejunum is unaffected. These effects involve both apical (SGLT1) and basolateral (GLUT2) hexose transporters. 2. The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (RAAS) in the epithelial response to Na+ intake was studied in chickens fed high-NaCl (HS) and low-NaCl (LS) diets. The V(max) of alpha-methyl-D-glucoside and D-glucose were determined in vesicles from the brush-border (BBMVs) and basolateral (BLMVs) membranes, respectively. The binding of phlorizin to BBMV and cytochalasin B to BLMV were used as indicators of the abundance of SGLT1 and GLUT2, respectively. 3. In HS-adapted chickens, the serum concentration of aldosterone (means +/- S.E.M.) was 35 +/- 5 pg ml(-1) (n = 6) and that of renin was 20 +/- 2 ng ml(-1) (n = 3). In LS-fed birds, these values were 166 +/- 12 pg ml(-1) (n = 6) and 122 +/- 5 ng ml(-1) (n = 3), respectively. Administration of captopril, the inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), to LS-chickens lowered the aldosterone serum concentration without affecting the renin concentration. Captopril also prevented the reduction of apical and basolateral hexose transport in ileum and rectum characteristic of the intestinal response to LS adaptation. 4. Administration of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone to LS-adapted chickens did not affect the serum concentrations of aldosterone, but prevented the effects of LS intake on hexose transport in both apical and basolateral membranes. This suggests that the effects of aldosterone are mediated by cytosolic mineralcorticoid receptors. 5. Administration of exogenous aldosterone to HS-fed birds induced hexose transport and binding properties typical of the LS-adapted animals. These findings support the view that aldosterone, besides its primary role in controlling intestinal Na+ absorption, can also modulate the expression of apical and basolateral glucose transporters in the chicken distal intestine.", 
    "781": "We investigated the role of circulating ANG II in sodium appetite after adrenalectomy. Adrenalectomized rats deprived of their main access to sodium (0.3 M NaCl) for 9 h drank 14.1 +/- 1.5 ml of the concentrated saline solution in 2 h of access. Intravenous infusion of captopril (2.5 mg/h) during the last 5 h of sodium restriction reduced sodium intake by 77 +/- 12% (n = 5) without affecting the degree of sodium depletion and hypovolemia incurred during deprivation. Functional evidence indicates that this dose of captopril blocked production of ANG II in the peripheral circulation, but not in the brain; that is, injection of ANG I into the lateral brain ventricle stimulated intake of both water and 0.3 M NaCl. Intravenous infusion of ANG II (starting 10-15 min before 0.3 M NaCl became available) in adrenalectomized, captopril-treated rats restored both sodium intake and blood pressure to values seen in rats not treated with captopril. Longer (20 h) infusions of captopril in 22-h sodium-restricted rats also blocked sodium appetite, but reduced or prevented sodium depletion. Intravenous infusion of ANG II after these long captopril infusions stimulated sodium intake, but intake was less than in controls not treated with captopril. These results indicate that most or all of the sodium appetite of adrenalectomized rats is mediated by circulating ANG II.", 
    "782": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) comprises an enormous public health burden, with an incidence and prevalence that are increasingly on the rise. This escalating prevalence suggests that newer therapeutic interventions and strategies are needed to complement current therapeutic approaches. Although much evidence demonstrates conclusively that angiotensin II mediates progressive renal disease, recent evidence also implicates aldosterone as an important pathogenetic factor in progressive renal disease. Recently, several lines of experimental evidence demonstrate that selective blockade of aldosterone, independent of renin-angiotensin blockade, reduces proteinuria and nephrosclerosis in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP) model and reduces proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in the subtotally nephrectomized rat model (ie, remnant kidney). Whereas pharmacologic blockade with angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces proteinuria and nephrosclerosis/glomerulosclerosis, selective reinfusion of aldosterone restores these abnormalities despite continued renin-angiotensin blockade. Aldosterone may promote fibrosis by several mechanisms, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression and consequent alterations of vascular ribrinolysis, by stimulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and by stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Based on this formulation, randomized clinical studies will be initiated to delineate the potential renal-protective effects of aldosterone receptor blockade.", 
    "783": "Recent studies have shown that steroids improve renal survival and reduce proteinuria in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients with moderate urinary protein excretion and normal renal function. However, this effect seems to diminish over time. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that long-term use of ramipril reduces the risk of end-stage renal disease in proteinuric diabetic and non-diabetic chronic nephropathies. We have planned a long-term unblinded, prospective, centrally randomized, controlled, multicentric trial to assess whether combined treatment of steroids and ramipril is superior to ramipril alone in patients with progressive IgAN disease. A minimum of 134 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN, grade G3 or G4, daily proteinuria > 1.0 g and creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min will be enrolled during a 2-year recruitment period. The patients will be allocated randomly to receive a six-month course of oral prednisone (1.0 mg/Kg/day for 2 months, tapered by 0.2 mg/Kg/day every month) plus ramipril (2.5 mg/day for one month, increased by 1.25 mg/day every month to achieve and maintain a blood pressure less than 120-80 mm Hg and/or to reduce daily proteinuria to 1.0 g or less or by at least 50%) in the experimental group or ramipril alone in the control group. Ramipril will be administered during the whole 5-year follow-up period in both groups. The primary endpoint will be renal survival estimated by 50% increase in baseline serum creatinine; the secondary endpoints will be urinary protein and cytokine excretion and side-effects. Analyses will be done by intention to treat. A p <0.05 will be taken as significant.",

This ACE-I induced cough appears to exhibit interracial differences being commoner in Chinese subjects as compared to Caucasians. We conducted a cross sectional study of one hundred (100) patients (63 males and 37 females) on ACE-I to determine the prevalence of ACE-induced cough in Nigerians, a Negroid population. Twenty seven patients (27%) had ACE-induced cough and four (4%) had withdrawal of ACE-I therapy on account of cough. The prevalence of ACE-I induced cough was significantly higher amongst females (43%) as compared to males (17%) p < 0.01. The biological basis for the apparent racial and gender differences in ACE-I induced cough requires further study.", 
    "785": "In this multicentre, double-blind trial in 176 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension were randomized to amlodipine or enalapril monotherapy after 2-week period of placebo. Doses of amlodipine (2.5-10 mg once daily) and enalapril (5-20 mg once daily) were titrated to achieve office blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg during 8 weeks of therapy. Both drugs were similarly effective in lowering blood pressure and goal blood pressure was achieved in 72.4% patients treated with amlodipine and 67.4% with enalapril. Also, degree of reduction of blood pressure was similar in both groups. Compared to initial values: systolic/diastolic blood pressure decreased by 23.5/14.9 mm Hg in amlodipine group and 23.2/14.0 mm Hg in subjects receiving enalapril. However, adverse effects, especially dry cough were more frequent in enalapril-treated patients. Both amlodipine and enalapril provide significant blood pressure reduction in stage I-II hypertension. Tolerance of short-term therapy was good in both groups however number of adverse events was significantly lower in amlodipine-treated patients.",

However, protection after 2 to 3 h of reperfusion does not mean that myocardium remains viable for an extended time. Therefore, we examined the effects of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ramiprilat), EP24.11 (cFP-F-pAB), and EP24.15 (cFP-AAF-pAB) in a chronic model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. A left descending coronary artery was occluded for 30 min in anesthetized rabbits. Saline, ramiprilat, or endopeptidase inhibitors were given after 27 min of occlusion. The BK(2) receptor antagonist HOE140 was administered in certain experiments. After ischemia, the occlusion was released, and the animal allowed to recover for 3 or 7 days. Surgery was then repeated, and the heart removed for determination of infarct size. In separate experiments, the heart was removed after 2 h of reperfusion for determination of BK tissue levels. Ramiprilat and endopeptidase inhibitors reduced infarct size at 3 and 7 days. Combining inhibitors further reduced infarct size after 3 days. The protective effect of the endopeptidase inhibitors was blocked by HOE140. Infarct sizes at 7 days were larger than at 3 days. The additive effect of multiple inhibitors was absent at 7 days. Ramiprilat and cFP-F-pAB significantly increased tissue BK levels. We conclude that inhibition of BK-inactivating enzymes protects endogenous BK from degradation and provides long-lasting protection from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. A single treatment at the time of reperfusion does not prevent extension of the infarction between 3 and 7 days.",

This single-dose, randomized, crossover study of 20 mg intravenous and 50 mg oral [14C]omapatrilat was conducted in 12 healthy male subjects to determine the disposition and oral bioavailability of omapatrilat, an orally active vasopeptidase inhibitor. Blood samples were collected up to 120 hours, and the excreta were collected over 168 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations of omapatrilat were determined by a validated LC/MS/MS procedure. Radioactivity in blood, plasma, urine, and feces was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Urinary excretion of radioactivity averaged 80% and 64% of intravenous and oral doses, respectively; < 1% of oral dose was excreted unchanged in urine. The absolute oral bioavailability of omapatrilat averaged 31%. Total body clearance of omapatrilat (80 L/h) exceeded liver plasma flow. Apparent steady-state volume of distribution of omapatrilat (21 L/kg) was extremely high compared with total body water. Omapatrilat undergoes substantial presystemic first-pass metabolism after oral administration. Omapatrilat is eliminated primarily by metabolism, and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in urine. Extrahepatic organs may be involved in the elimination of omapatrilat. Plasma concentrations of omapatrilat exhibit a prolonged terminal elimination phase, which represents elimination from a deep compartment.", 
    "792": "Inhibition or reversal of ventricular remodelling in heart failure patients is regarded as of prime importance in the treatment of heart failure and in determining long term outcome. Recent studies have demonstrated that the addition of carvedilol to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other routine heart failure therapy results in a valuable improvement in the clinical status and life expectancy of mild, moderate and severe heart failure patients. ACE inhibitors have become the cornerstone of heart failure therapy. Also, carvedilol in combination with standard therapy (including ACE inhibitors) has demonstrable beneficial effects on left ventricular remodelling. Each new treatment has to be added, this quickly leads to polypharmacy, which may not be necessary and even unwanted in the individual patient, as the pharmacological profile of carvedilol compares favourably to ACE inhibitors, this suggests that it could challenge ACE inhibitors as first-line treatment for heart failure. The CARMEN trial (Carvedilol and ACE-Inhibitor Remodelling Mild Heart Failure EvaluatioN) was designed to compare the effects of carvedilol alone and of carvedilol plus an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) with the effect of an ACE inhibitor alone on different parameters of left ventricular remodelling as well as morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic mild heart failure, thereby allowing conclusions on whether combination therapy may be replaced by the multiple action adrenergic inhibitor carvedilol in the future.",

There was a trend towards thicker infarcts in the reperfusion group compared to the control group (0.84 +/- 0.06 vs 0.72 +/- 0.05 mm, p = 0.1).

Clinicians should strive to use the least intrusive means possible to achieve goal blood pressure and the treatment regiment should be individualized for each patient.

This ACE-independent production of Ang II appears to be caused by serine proteases, one of which presumably is chymase. However, several serine proteases may produce Ang II, and the exact role of chymase in the vascular production of Ang II has never been directly evaluated using selective chymase inhibitors.",

Captopril only partially inhibited (by 33%) the response to Ang I. In the absence of captopril, C41 markedly reduced (by 44%) the response to Ang I, and this effect was identical to that of chymostatin. C41 also significantly reduced the response to Ang I in the presence of captopril, although this inhibitory effect was slightly less than that of captopril in combination with chymostatin. [Pro,(11)D-Ala(12)] Ang I induced potent contractions that were not affected by captopril but were abolished by chymostatin and markedly reduced by C41. In addition, we found that prior treatment of the patients with an ACE inhibitor did not affect the in vitro response to Ang I (in the absence or the presence of captopril) or to [Pro,(11)D-Ala(12)] Ang I.",

This increase is abolished by exposure of myocytes to ANG II in vitro. Because ANG II induces translocation of the epsilon-isoform of protein kinase C (PKCepsilon), we examined whether this isozyme regulates the pump. We treated rabbits with captopril, isolated myocytes, and measured I(p) of myocytes voltage clamped with wide-tipped patch pipettes. I(p) of myocytes from captopril-treated rabbits was larger than I(p) of myocytes from controls. ANG II superfusion of myocytes from captopril-treated rabbits decreased I(p) to levels similar to controls. Inclusion of PKCepsilon-specific blocking peptide in pipette solutions used to perfuse the intracellular compartment abolished the effect of ANG II. Inclusion of psiepsilonRACK, a PKCepsilon-specific activating peptide, in pipette solutions had an effect on I(p) that was similar to that of ANG II. There was no additive effect of ANG II and psiepsilonRACK. We conclude that PKCepsilon regulates the sarcolemmal Na(+)-K(+) pump.",

Significant age- and gender-related differences in prescribing patterns were seen. Short-acting nifedipine monotherapy was inappropriately prescribed in a significant number of patients above the age of 50 years. ACE inhibitors accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total antihypertensive drug expenditure, although these drugs represent only one-fifth of overall antihypertensives used.

Almost two-thirds of the patients were treated with monotherapy. A disproportionately large percentage of antihypertensive drug cost was due to overt use of ACE inhibitors, and indapamide, instead of thiazide diuretics.

In diseased native kidneys, proteinuria and progression to failure are linked. We proposed a pathogenic role for this excess protein at a tubular level in kidney diseases of dissimilar origin. We demonstrated in both nephrotic patients with normal function and in those with failing kidneys increased renal tubular catabolism and turnover rates of a peptide marker, Aprotinin (Apr), linked to increased ammonia excretion and tubular injury. These potentially injurious processes were suppressed by reducing proteinuria with Lisinopril. Do similar mechanisms of renal injury and such a linkage also occur in proteinuric transplanted patients with CR, and if so, is Lisinopril then of beneficial value? We now examine these aspects in 11 patients with moderate/severe renal impairment (51CrEDTA clearance 26.2+/-3.3 mL/min/1.73 m2), proteinuria (6.1+/-1.5 g/24 h) and biopsy proven CR. Lisinopril (10-40 mg) was given daily for 2 months in 7 patients. Four others were given oral sodium bicarbonate (Na HCO3) for 2 months before adding Lisinopril. Renal tubular catabolism of intravenous 99mTc-Apr (Apr* 0.5 mg, 80MBq), was measured before and after Lisinopril by gamma-ray renal imaging and urinary radioactivity of the free radiolabel over 26 h. Fractional degradation was calculated from these data. Total 24 h urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucoaminidase (NAG) and ammonia excretion in fresh timed urine collections were also measured every two weeks from two months before treatment. After Lisinopril proteinuria fell significantly (from 7.8+/-2.2 to 3.4+/-1.9 g/24 h, p<0.05). This was associated with a reduction in metabolism of Apr* over 26 h (from 0.5+/-0.05 to 0.3+/-0.005% dose/h, p < 0.02), and in fractional degradation (from 0.04+/-0.009 to 0.02+/-0.005/h, p<0.01). Urinary ammonia fell, but surprisingly not significantly and this was explained by the increased clinical acidosis after Lisinopril, (plasma bicarbonate fell from 19.1+/-0.7 to 17.4+/-0.8 mmol/L, p < 0.01), an original observation. Total urinary NAG did fall significantly from a median of 2108 (range 1044-3816) to 1008 (76-2147) micromol/L, p < 0.05. There was no significant change in blood pressure or in measurements of glomerular hemodynamics.

An interim analysis of the AASK at 3 years revealed a renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril as compared to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB) amlodipine in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. This differential effect was independent of the blood pressure (BP) levels reached and was evident in proteinuric patients and suggestive in patients with baseline proteinuria < 300 mg/d, but was not conclusive. The AASK trial data suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used cautiously in the presence of mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Judgment should be reserved for the use of other CCBs, such as verapamil or diltiazem, since these are fundamentally different CCBs with the potential for a different impact on hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The blinded observation period for AASK will be completed at the end of September, 2001, at which time additional, clinically useful information is expected to become available.

    "849": "Uncontrolled hypertension leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Hypertensive patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes are at even greater risk of cardiovascular complications; also, this high-risk patient population is at increased risk of renal disease and, ultimately, renal failure. Prospective morbidity and mortality trials have demonstrated that tight blood pressure control improves the cardiovascular prognosis and provides target organ protection. Current treatment guidelines recommend a target blood pressure of < 130/85 mm Hg for patients with hypertension and diabetes. Angiotensin II (A-II), a major component of the renin-angiotensin system, plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and diabetes-related renal disease. Currently, the treatment of choice for hypertensive patients with diabetes is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, but most of the data are limited to patients with type 1 diabetes. Although ACE inhibition is clearly a mechanism for blocking A-II formation, inhibition at this site may not be complete, as alternate pathways exist for A-II formation. Thus, for interrupting the renin-angiotensin system, A-II receptor antagonists theoretically provide advantages over ACE inhibitors in that they directly inhibit A-II by binding to the AT(1) receptor subtype. The objectives of this review are to: 1) provide an overview of the associated risk of cardiovascular complications with concomitant hypertension and diabetes; 2) demonstrate the cardiovascular benefits of effective blood pressure control in this patient population; 3) review the current treatment guidelines for managing high-risk hypertensive patients; and 4) discuss major, ongoing clinical studies with A-II receptor antagonists in patients with concomitant hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and renal disease.

The decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly more marked in patients treated with beta blockers than in patients on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. For systolic blood pressure, decreases were larger in patients treated with diuretics than with calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Prostatism symptoms decreased from 15 +/- 5.8 points to 7.9 +/- 4.3 points (p is less than 0.001) and quality of life improved. Tolerability was good, with only a 4.4% cumulative incidence of adverse effects related to doxazosin. The patients who experienced adverse effects were older and their final blood pressures were lower. The results of this open-label study suggest that the addition of doxazosin to another antihypertensive drug in hypertensive patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy is well tolerated and leads to a reduction in prostatic symptoms. The additional beneficial effects on blood pressure suggest that the use of doxazosin may provide a rational approach to this category of patients.(c)2001 Le Jacq Communications, Inc.",

Proinflammatory potency of the nonpeptide bradykinin (BK) B(2) receptor agonist FR190997 (8-[2,6-dichloro-3-[N-[(E)-4-(N-methylcarbamoyl)cinnamidoacetyl]-N-methylamino]benzyloxy]-2-methyl-4-(2-pyridylmethoxy)quinoline) was investigated. 2. Intradermal injection of FR190997 (0.03 - 3 nmol site(-1)) into dorsal skin of rats increased vascular permeability in a dose-dependent manner. The effect was less than that of BK, but it was long-acting and was inhibited by treatment with FR173657 (3 mg kg(-1), p.o.). Captopril (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) did not enhance the plasma extravasation by FR190997 (0.3 nmol site(-1)) in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, 30 microg site(-1)). 3. Subcutaneous injection of FR190997 (3 nmol site(-1)) into the hindpaw of mice markedly induced paw swelling. The oedema lasted up to 3 h after the injection. Administration of indomethacin or NS-398 (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) significantly reduced it at 3 h after the injection. 4. Simultaneous i.p. injection of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) (1 nmol site(-1)) or beraprost sodium (0.5 nmol site(-1)) with FR190997 (5 nmol site(-1)) greatly enhanced frequency of writhing reactions in mice. 5. FR190997 (0.3 - 30 nmol kg(-1), i.v.) showed less increase in airway opening pressure (Pao) in the guinea-pig after i.v. injection. Furthermore, FR190997 (0.03 - 30 nmol) resulted in a very weak contraction of tracheal ring strips and lung parenchymal sections in vitro. 6. In mice sponge implants, topical application of FR190997 increased angiogenesis and granulation with enhanced expressions of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNAs. 7. These results indicate that FR190997 has proinflammatory long-lasting characteristics and it might be 'a stable tool' for studying the role of BK B(2) receptor in vivo.",

    "853": "All subjects received omapatrilat 25 mg orally once daily for 14 days. Plasma renin and urinary atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were measured to assess the effect of omapatrilat on cirrhotic subjects. The effect of omapatrilat on blood pressure as well as changes in ANP and plasma renin levels were not altered by hepatic impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from plasma omapatrilat concentrations.", 
    "854": "There were no significant differences between the two subject groups with regard to log-transformed area under the curve or maximum observed plasma concentration. Systemic accumulation was similar in the two groups.", 
    "855": "These results suggest, based on findings in otherwise healthy cirrhotic subjects, that no adjustment of standard dosing regimens is indicated for hypertensive patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis.", 
    "856": "Abundant evidence has accumulated showing that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in patients with heart failure and myocardial infarction. Fewer completed trials have assessed their potential benefits in this regard in hypertensive subjects, but evidence of benefit is beginning to accrue from studies examining patients with hypertension, particularly in the presence of diabetes and after infarction. Ongoing trials of blood pressure (BP) lowering using ACE inhibition fall into three main categories: 1) those comparing ACE inhibitors with older drugs such as diuretics and beta blockers; 2) those examining more aggressive versus less aggressive lowering of BP; and 3) those investigating BP lowering in patients at high risk for a cardiac event. Among those in the last group is the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), which examines the effects of perindopril-based ACE inhibitor therapy in both normotensive and hypertensive patients who have survived a stroke. This trial is particularly important because it serves as a model for studies of BP lowering across a wide range of BP and BP-related conditions.", 
    "857": "Protection of the endothelium, the metabolically active inner lining of the vasculature, appears to be a key factor in maintaining cardiovascular (CV) health. The endothelium responds to hemodynamic and hormonal factors by secreting substances that maintain vascular homeostasis. Damage to the endothelium is an initial step in the development of CV disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the formation of the vasoconstricting substance, angiotensin II, have proved to be a key therapy for hypertension and congestive heart failure. The activity of these agents in enhancing vascular health appears to be a critical factor in their therapeutic effectiveness. Large-scale clinical trials over the past decade have shown that ACE inhibition is an effective therapeutic means of not only prolonging survival and reducing morbidity after acute myocardial infarction, but also reducing all-cause mortality and morbidity in patients at high risk for CV disease, including patients with diabetes. ACE is found in far greater amounts in tissue than in plasma. Studies indicate that ACE inhibitors act at the tissue level to provide long-term cardioprotective effects that include a reduction in the progression of atherosclerosis. An issue to resolve is how much ACE inhibition is needed at the tissue level to reverse or prevent further vascular damage.", 
    "858": "Blood pressure is a critical element of hypertension, but evidence shows that many other interrelated risk factors--such as hypercholesterolemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, insulin resistance, and vascular dysfunction--contribute to form a complex syndrome of hypertension. Studies have demonstrated that these other risk factors often precede the onset of elevated blood pressure (BP). Significantly, this has been shown in the normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents. One factor that the elements of the hypertension syndrome have in common is endothelial dysfunction. An upset in the normal balance of angiotensin II and nitric oxide in the endothelial cell is associated with manifestation of the hypertension syndrome-associated risk factors. Recognition of this fact can and should be constructively incorporated into clinical practice in three ways: earlier identification of patients with the hypertension syndrome, earlier treatment to prevent disease onset/progression, and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to correct the critical imbalance in the endothelial cell.", 
    "859": "Large artery properties constitute an important component of left ventricular afterload in hypertension. The present study examined whether such properties were particularly responsive to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. A prospective, randomized, 12-week study in 138 previously treated hypertensive subjects, in 67 of whom usual treatment (UC) was replaced with perindopril (P) therapy. Large artery properties were assessed as central arterial pressure augmentation determined by applanation tonometry of the radial artery and a transfer function. At baseline both augmentation index (AI, %) and pressure (AP, mm Hg) were related to body size, heart rate, and gender. In addition AP was related to age and systolic blood pressure (BP). After 12 weeks of treatment AP decreased significantly in both perindopril and UC groups, whereas AI only decreased significantly (151.7%+/-2.3% to 144.9%+/-2.6%) in those treated with perindopril. Decreases in AP (-4.2+/-0.9 mm Hg v -1.9+/-0.7 mm Hg) and AI (-6.8%+/-2.2% v -2.2%+/-2.5%) from week 0 to week 12 were greater in the perindopril-treated group, but differences between groups failed to reach statistical significance (P = .05 and .09, respectively). The change in AI during the 12-week treatment period was dependent on the initial heart rate (P < .001), systolic BP (P < .05), weight (P < .001), and sex (P < .001), but not on treatment group (P > .5). Al at 12 weeks was negatively correlated with heart rate but regression slopes for the association were virtually identical for perindopril and UC groups. Perindopril treatment produces a greater decrease in AI than continuation with previous therapy, but this can be largely explained by hemodynamic changes rather than direct arterial effects.", 
    "860": "This multicenter, double-blind study evaluated efficacy and safety of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat, which simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme, when given in conjunction with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to subjects nonresponsive to HCTZ alone. The study enrolled 657 subjects with mild to severe hypertension. After a 2-week placebo lead-in period and a 4-week HCTZ phase, 274 subjects were randomized to receive omapatrilat (10 or 20 mg, electively titrated to 20 or 40 mg, respectively, at week 4 if seated diastolic blood pressure [SeDBP] was > or =90 mm Hg) or matching placebo in addition to 25 mg of HCTZ as continuing therapy. The primary outcome measure was change in SeDBP from baseline to week 8. At week 8, placebo plus HCTZ-adjusted additional reductions in SeDBP in the omapatrilat 10/20 mg and 20/40 mg treatment groups (4 and 5 mm Hg, respectively) were significant (P < .001), as were changes in seated systolic blood pressure in both omapatrilat-treated groups (7 and 10 mm Hg, respectively; P < .001). Seated diastolic blood pressure was normalized (<90 mm Hg) in 38% of subjects in the placebo group compared to 59% and 64% of subjects in the omapatrilat groups (P < or = .008). Adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuations attributed to adverse events were infrequent. There were no clinically relevant changes in serum creatinine or potassium. Omapatrilat was effective and well tolerated when added to HCTZ in subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled with HCTZ alone.", 
    "861": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonists have proven to be effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agents. They also exhibit unique cardioprotective and renoprotective properties in patients with comorbid conditions such as congestive heart failure and proteinuria or renal insufficiency. This benefit is observed most dramatically in diabetic persons. Although inconclusive, the results of a limited number of clinical trials support the notion that additive antihypertensive, cardioprotective, and renoprotective effects may be obtained with combined used of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonists in some patients. More studies are needed to confirm the findings of these preliminary studies, and to define more clearly those subsets of patients who might derive the greatest benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonist combination therapy.", 
    "862": "There is a wealth of data that suggests an important interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic stable cardiovascular disease. The interaction is less obvious in the postinfarction setting, possibly reflecting the fact that many patients stop their aspirin therapy within a few months of such an event. An interaction is biologically plausible, because there is considerable evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert important effects through increasing the production of vasodilator prostaglandins, whereas aspirin blocks their production through inhibition of cyclooxygenase, even at low doses. There is some evidence that low-dose aspirin may raise systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There is also considerable evidence that aspirin may entirely neutralize the clinical benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In addition, aspirin may have an adverse effect on outcome in patients with heart failure that is independent of any interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, possibly by blocking endogenous vasodilator prostaglandin production and enhancing the vasoconstrictor potential of endothelin. The evidence is not sufficient to justify advising long-term aspirin therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease in general, and for those with heart failure in particular. Thus, the lack of evidence of benefit with aspirin in patients with heart failure and coronary disease, along with growing evidence that aspirin is directly harmful in patients with heart failure and that aspirin may negate the benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors suggest that, unless there is an opportunity to randomize the patient into a study of antithrombotic strategies, then aspirin should be withdrawn or possibly substituted with an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet agent that does not block cyclooxygenase. In contrast, there is fairly robust evidence for a benefit of both aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during the first 5 weeks after a myocardial infarction, with little evidence of an interaction. The combination of aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is warranted during this period, after which discontinuation or substitution of aspirin with another agent should be considered.", 
    "863": "Remodeling of large and small arteries in hypertension contributes to elevation of blood pressure, and may participate in the complications of hypertension. Large arteries exhibit increased lumen size, thickened media with increased collagen deposition, and decreased compliance, which contributes to raised systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. In small (resistance) arteries smooth muscle cells are restructured around a smaller lumen, without true hypertrophy, particularly in milder forms of hypertension, whereas in severe forms and in secondary hypertension hypertrophic remodeling has been reported. Endothelial dysfunction occurs in many patients, with prevalence similar to that of left ventricular hypertrophy. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor subtype 1 antagonists and long-acting calcium channel blockers has corrected changes in large and small arteries in hypertensive patients. Treatment with beta-blockers did not modify either structure or function of small arteries. Improved outcomes were reported in clinical trials with drugs that exert vascular protective effects, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor subtype 1 antagonists, as well as with those that do not appear to improve vascular structure or function. Recent trials suggest that these different drugs may provide similar benefits essentially through blood pressure lowering, although some minor differences between drugs have been noted. For example, the alpha-blocker doxasozin has been associated with worse outcomes (heart failure) than have diuretics. That hard end-point clinical trials have not demonstrated any advantages of agents with vasculoprotective properties may relate in part to the relatively short duration of some of these multicenter trials (3-5 years). Another contributing factor may be the low number of events with each drug class in the longer trials. Thus, current evidence does not support the rational expectation that vasculoprotective antihypertensive agents will be associated with better outcomes in hypertensive patients, possibly because of limitations of these trials.", 
    "864": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study was a landmark study employing the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in a patient population pre-destined for vascular events. This study found that a 10 mg dose of ramipril in comparison with placebo reduced the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes by 22%. This improvement in outcome was viewed as a direct consequence of ramipril, although the fact that blood pressure was reduced with ramipril has cast some considerable doubt on this supposition. Whether the observed findings in this study are a 'class effect' for all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is unclear. To its credit, ramipril is the first angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor shown to prevent ischemic events in high-risk patients without discernible left ventricular dysfunction. Other similar trials are underway, which are studying similar populations to those included in this landmark study and should resolve the question of whether the cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are a 'class effect'.", 
    "865": "Recent hypertension trials have demonstrated the importance of achieving goal blood pressures to reduce the risk of target organ damage. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, the use of high-dose monotherapy and/or combinations of drugs are necessary to achieve these goals. Fixed-dose combination products may be useful in these patients by reducing the number of daily doses required to control blood pressure.", 
    "866": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic interchange between high-dose calcium channel blocker therapy and a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/ benazepril (Lotrel; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, USA) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "867": "A total of 75 patients were switched from amlodipine (n = 25), felodipine (n = 25), and nifedipine-GITS (n = 25) to amlodipine/benazepril. Twenty-eight of the 75 patients (37%) were taking either a beta-blocker or a diuretic in addition to the high-dose calcium channel blocker prior to the switch. Blood pressure control, side effects and the cost of the therapeutic interchange were evaluated in the year following the therapeutic interchange.", 
    "868": "Sixty-six of the 75 (88%) patients were successfully switched with maintenance of blood pressure control and without the development of new dose-limiting side effects. Reasons for treatment failure after the therapeutic interchange included loss of blood pressure control in five patients and the development of new dose-limiting side effects in four patients. These side effects included cough in three patients and rash in one patient. After accounting for differences in drug acquisition cost and costs related to the switch (clinic and emergency room and laboratory tests), a cost savings of $16030 for all 75 patients was realised in the first year. The per patient-per year cost savings was $214.",

    "870": "The renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, different results from studies attempting to attenuate the process by inhibiting the converting enzyme were equivocal, and in those who succeeded, blood pressure was lowered and/or the lipid profile was improved in addition to the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin axis. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of low doses of fosinopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, on the development of atherosclerosis in LDL-receptor-deficient mice.", 
    "871": "Three groups of 15 mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol western diet. The three study groups received either distilled water (control group), or water supplemented with fosinopril 0.01 mg/kg/day (low-dose group) or with 0.1 mg/kg/day (high-dose group). Plasma aldosterone levels and lipid profiles were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. After 10 weeks, the mice were sacrificed and the extent of atherosclerosis was assessed at the aortic sinus.", 
    "872": "Plasma aldosterone levels did not change in the control group, but decreased significantly in both treated groups from 74.7 to 39.3 ng/ml in the low-dose group (p < 0.003) and from 70.7 to 33.6 ng/ml in the high-dose group (p < 0.001). The lipid profile at the end of the study showed significantly lower levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the high-dose group as compared to the low-dose group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the three groups regarding the area of atherosclerosis at the aortic sinus: 157,000 +/- 34,000, 130,000 +/- 58,000 and 145,000 +/- 26,000 microm(2) in the control, low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively.",

Two-thirds (64.3%) of patients had heart failure attributed to ischaemic heart disease. During the study, most patients (61.1%) had at least one cardiovascular hospitalization and 42.5% of all patients died: most deaths (88.2%) were cardiovascular. Nearly half (49.7%) of the cardiovascular deaths were considered sudden and 45.2% of cardiovascular deaths occurred as the first cardiovascular event. A third (30.2%) of deaths resulted from heart failure and were generally preceded by hospitalization, either for heart failure (85.5%), myocardial ischaemic events (21.7%) or arrhythmias (18.0%). Compared with low-dose, high-dose lisinopril was associated with a lower risk of death or hospitalization for any reason (P=0.002) and death or hospitalization with worsening heart failure (P<0.001). High-dose lisinopril delayed the time to all-cause mortality and hospitalization for chronic heart failure by 7.1 months.", 
    "876": "Vascular and arrhythmic events may not only be important precipitants of sudden death, but were also seen to contribute to the progression of heart failure.

The initial dose of the drug was 5 mg. Dose selection was controlled by 24-h AP monitoring. Enalapril was shown to significantly reduce mean daytime and 24-h AP as well as hyperbaric index, chronobiological time index, variability of systolic AP. The above dose selection brought more balanced AP lowering at daytime and at night. After 11 weeks of treatment no night-peakers were registered, the number of over-dippers decreased. Circadian rhythm of some hemodynamic parameters was characterized by a significant fall of rhythm average in unchanged acrophase and circadian AP amplitude indicating physiological action of enalapril.", 
    "878": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme is probably involved in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis, both through an increase in vascular angiotensin II and by an effect on the degradation of bradykinin into inactive fragments. Moreover, angiotensin II has a prothrombotic effect and prevails in increased concentration in the blood of animals subjected to experimentally induced myocardial infarction.",

There are indications that they counteract ischaemia, reduce heart failure and prevent reinfarction. Experimental observations in animals also indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors limit myocardial injury, presumably in part through the effects of bradykinin. This is supported by some few clinical studies, including a Norwegian epidemiological study. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced the progression of intima-media thickness in the carotid arteries.",
