    "2": "The study population comprised all patients hospitalized with AMI at the American University of Beirut between January 1, 1997, and December 30, 1998. The medical records of the patients were reviewed to determine their clinical characteristics, the diagnostic and invasive procedures used during the hospitalization, and any in-hospital complications, including death.", 
    "3": "The population comprised 184 patients with a mean age of 60+/-13 years. Fifty-two per cent of the infarcts were anterior and 76% developed Q waves. Fifty-one per cent of the patients received thrombolytic therapy. At discharge, 80% of the patients were given acetylsalicylic acid, 35% were given beta-blockers, 34% were given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 30% were given statins. Seventy-two per cent of the patients underwent coronary angiography, 23% underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and 13% had coronary artery bypass grafting. The in-hospital mortality was 13%. The predictors of in-hospital mortality were advanced age (over 60 years), diabetes, prior AMI, Killip class greater than I and ejection fraction less that 40%. In contrast, the predictors of coronary angiography were younger age (less than 60 years), absence of diabetes or no history of AMI, Killip class I and ejection fraction greater than 40%.", 
    "4": "Coronary angiography after AMI was performed more frequently than expected in a university medical centre in a developing country, and it seemed to be selectively used in the low- risk patients rather than the high-risk ones. Furthermore, the underuse of medical therapy with beta-blockers and statins was evident. These findings should prompt cardiac societies in these countries to initiate educational campaigns focusing on the cost-effectiveness of therapy in AMI to optimize the use of their limited resources.",

A history of hypercholesterolemia or a fasting cholesterol of 5.2 mmol/L or greater was found in 56% of patients. Eighty per cent suffered ST-segment elevation AMI. Four hundred seventy-six patients who were eligible for thrombolytic therapy were identified, 12 (3%) of whom did not receive it. The median time from diagnostic electrocardiogram to thrombolytic therapy was 45 min. The rate of prescribing acetylsalicylic acid, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins at discharge among survivors was 98%, 86%, 51% and 50%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.2%.",

The rate of use of acetylsalicylic acid and beta-blockers was appropriate, while that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins needs to be improved.", 
    "10": "We assessed the 'synergy' of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in reducing vascular events in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The GREek Atorvastatin and CHD Evaluation (GREACE) Study, suggested that aggressive reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to 2.59 mmol/l (<100 mg/dl) significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in CHD patients, in comparison to undertreated patients. In this post hoc analysis of GREACE the patients (n=1600) were divided into four groups according to long-term treatment: Group A (n=460 statin+ACEI), B (n=420; statin, no ACEI), C (n=371;no statin, on ACEI), and D (n=349; no statin, no ACEI). Analysis of variance was used to assess differences in the relative risk reduction (RRR) in 'all events' (primary end point) between groups. During the 3-year follow-up there were 292 cardiovascular events; 45 (10% of patients) in group A, 61 (14.5%) in group B, 91 in group C (24.5%) and 95 events in group D (27%). The RRR (95% confidence interval (CI) in the primary end point in group A was 31%, (95% CI -48 to -6%, P=0.01) in comparison to group B, 59% (95% CI -72 to -48%, P<0.0001) to group C and 63% (95% CI -74 to -51%, P<0.0001) to group D. There was no significant difference in RRR between groups C and D (9%, CI -27-10%, P=0.1). Other factors (eg the blood pressure) that can influence clinical outcome did not differ significantly between the four treatment groups. In conclusion, the statin+ACEI combination reduces cardiovascular events more than a statin alone and considerably more than an ACEI alone. Aggressive statin use in the absence of an ACEI also substantially reduced cardiovascular events. Treatment with an ACEI in the absence of a statin use reduced clinical events in comparison to patients not treated with an ACEI but not significantly, at least in these small groups of patients.",

    "12": "The traditional methods for assessing functional status including New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, exercise intolerance and quality of life were reviewed in relation to BNP measurements in patients with LVSD. A meta-analysis of four studies evaluating BNP levels versus exercise peak oxygen uptake or 6-minute walking distance showed a significant correlation, but a low R-value of -0.59. Studies using BNP levels for optimisation of heart failure therapy showed conflicting results concerning the correlation between the functional improvement and changes in BNP levels. Conflicting results were also found concerning the utility of BNP levels as a surrogate to predict efficacy of the various anti-congestive therapies on heart failure outcome.", 
    "13": "The results of the studies examining BNP measurement as a surrogate for functional status and drug efficacy in patients with LVSD are conflicting.

    "15": "20 patients with angiographically documented stable coronary artery disease (CAD) were prospectively treated with 5 mg of ramipril per day for 4 weeks. Before and weekly after the initiation of ramipril therapy, EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood and counted. Ramipril treatment of patients with stable CAD was associated with an approximately 1.5-fold increase in the number of circulating EPCs by 1 week after initiation of treatment; this was followed by sustained increased levels to approximately 2.5-fold throughout the 4-week study period. In addition, ramipril treatmen was associated with increases in the functional activity of EPCs, as assessed by their proliferation, migration, adhesion and in vitro vasculogenesis capacity.", 
    "16": "The results of the present study define a novel mechanism of action of ACEI treatment in patients with stable CAD: the augmentation of circulating EPCs with enhanced functional activity. Given the well-established role of EPCs of participating in repair after ischemic injury, stimulation of EPCs by ACEI may contribute to the clinical benefit of ACEI therapy in patients with CAD.", 
    "17": "A preterm infant with renovascular hypertension who developed significant trilineage bone marrow suppression after receiving captopril is reported. Captopril-associated pancytopenia is a very rare complication that was thought to be dose-related and usually caused by accumulation of the drug through defective renal tubular excretion. In our patient, it appears that the combination of renal artery stenosis and renal tubular dysfunction of prematurity might have led to pancytopenia. Captopril should be used with caution especially in premature babies and newborns with underlying renal or renovascular disease even if they do not have overt renal dysfunction. Monitorization of these babies with creatinine clearance or free serum captopril levels may help to establish accumulation of the drug before causing pancytopenia.", 
    "18": "UNBLOCK THE CORONARY ARTERIES: For the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with ST-segment elevation, emergency repermeabilisation is of the artery is crucial, generally by primary angioplasty than by fibrinolysis. The other treatments have little beneficial effects on mortality. Primary angioplasty is the technique of choice when it can be performed in the intensive care units with staff with sufficient experience and within the 90 minutes following the preliminary medical management, and benefiting from the supply of PG IIb-IIIa. THROMBOLYSIS: Performed before the twelfth hour, thrombolysis reduces mortality. The earlier it is performed the greater the benefits. A significant reduction is mortality is observed even in patients aged over 75. The indications for coronography are determined by the existence of clinical risk factors and by the data of supplementary non-invasive examinations (sonography, scintigraphy, effort testing). When clinical risk factors exist from the start, a coronography must be performed. In the absence of initial risks, and if the non-invasive examination reveals risk factors, then a coronarography should be performed.", 
    "19": "NEW DENOMINATIONS: With the arrival of new therapeutic strategies requiring rapid intervention, acute coronary syndromes required classification on earlier data than the Q-wave or MB creatinine kinase. In a patient with anginal pain and depending on the electrocardiogram, we now distinguish syndromes with or without ST segment elevation. REGARDING ANTIPLATELET DRUGS: Aspirin is used in all cases, as well as clopidogrel. Anti PG IIb-IIIa agents are set aside only for the forms at risk, when an angioplasty is envisaged in the short term. ANTICOAGULANTS: Enoxaparin has demonstrated its superiority over unfractionated heparin. In general, the biological controls are not indispensables; they can however be used in certain cases (notably elderly patients). OTHER TREATMENTS: These are beta-blockers (first dose via the intravenous route in the case of persisting pain, then relay to the oral route), calcium-channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) when beta-blockers are contraindicated, nitrate derivatives with demonstrated antalgic effect but not to be used if an extension to the right ventricle or low blood pressure is suspected, nasal oxygen in the case of cyanosis or respiratory distress, enzyme conversion inhibitors if hypertension persists, and repeated intravenous injections of morphine in the case of persisting intense pain. CORONARY REVASCULARISATION: In all the patients considered at high risk, coronary revascularisation is recommended within the first 24 hours, when technically possible.",

    "21": "Four weeks after abdominal aorto-caval (AV) shunting or sham operation in rats, the hearts were retrogradely perfused in vivo and the left ventricles contracted isovolumetrically at 300 beats/min. Sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) was performed in the baseline state and repeated with an infusion of the angiotensin II (A-II) type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) blocker, losartan, the A-II type 2 receptor (AT(2)-R) blocker, PD123319, or A-II. Norepinephrine (NE) overflow and left ventricular (LV) inotropic responses during baseline SNS were lower in the AV shunt rats. Losartan did not change the NE overflow or the LV inotropic responses to SNS in the sham rats, but did increase them in the AV shunt rats. PD123319 changed neither parameter in the sham rats, but decreased both in the AV shunt rats. A-II enhanced the NE overflow but attenuated the LV inotropic responses to SNS in the sham rats, but attenuated both in the AV shunt rats.",

    "23": "Telmisartan (Micardis) is a potent, long-lasting, nonpeptide angiotensin II type-1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker (ARB) that is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension. In receptor binding studies, telmisartan showed a high affinity and selectivity for the human AT(1) receptors compared with AT(2) receptors and a slower dissociation rate from the human AT(1) receptor than those of ARBs. In isolated aorta rings, telmisartan was shown to be an insurmountable antagonist of AII-induced contractions. The inhibitory effects of telmisartan on AII-induced contraction persisted even after wash-out procedures. In animal models such as spontaneous hypertension rats and renovascular hypertensive rats, telmisartan produced the consistent reduction of blood pressure. Furthermore, there were no rebound phenomenon and no tolerance to the drug developed in the repeated oral administration. Telmisartan has a longer terminal elimination half-life (about 24 h) than the other ARBs. In patients with mild-moderate hypertension, trough/peak ratios for telmisartan were above 80%. In Japanese patients with mild-moderate hypertension, telmisartan produced a significant reduction in blood pressure (effective rate: 76.0%) with a good safety profile. Therefore, telmisartan is expected to be effective in the treatment of hypertension, producing sustained 24-h blood pressure control.", 
    "24": "Elevated plasma homocysteine has been implicated as a risk factor for hypertension. C677T polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia, which results in endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to remedy the endothelial dysfunction and restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The co-existence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes, targets, receptors, and transporters may influence the drug efficacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was modulated by C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism.", 
    "25": "A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them were treated orally with benazepril at a single daily fixed dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the frequency of MTHFR C677T genotype CC, CT and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a recessive model (CC+CT versus TT genotype), both baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) were significantly higher in patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CT or CC genotype (P value=0.0076 for DBP, and P value=0.0005 for DeltaDBP). We further divided all patients into three groups based on the tertiles of the DeltaBP distribution. Compared to subjects in the lowest tertile of DeltaDBP, the adjusted relative odds of having the TT genotype among subjects in the highest tertile was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9). However, baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SBP response did not significantly associate with MTHFR C677T polymorphism.",

    "27": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure, volume and electrolyte homeostasis. Inappropriate activation of the RAS may lead to hypertension. Clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between Vitamin D-deficiency and high blood pressure. Our recent studies demonstrate that Vitamin D is a potent endocrine suppressor of renin biosynthesis to regulate the RAS. Mice lacking the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) have elevated production of renin and angiotensin (Ang) II, leading to hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and increased water intake. These abnormalities can be prevented by treatment with an ACE inhibitor or AT(1) receptor antagonist. Vitamin D repression of renin expression is independent of calcium metabolism, the volume- and salt-sensing mechanisms and the Ang II feedback regulation. In normal mice, Vitamin D-deficiency stimulates renin expression, whereas injection of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] reduces renin synthesis. In cell cultures, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) directly suppresses renin gene transcription by a VDR-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we have found that Gemini compounds have more potent renin-suppressing activity than 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Collectively, our studies reveal a critical role of the Vitamin D endocrine system in the regulation of blood pressure and volume homeostasis, and suggest that low calcemic Vitamin D analogs may potentially be developed into a new class of anti-hypertensive agents to control renin production and blood pressure.", 
    "28": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH) is an uncommon complication of pulmonary embolism. The treatment of choice is thromboendarterectomy, a safe and effective surgical procedure in expert hands. However, a fair number of patients are not considered candidates for thromboendarterectomy or do not accept the risk involved. Such patients may respond well to prostacyclin or its derivatives. In recent years new vasodilator drugs administered by a variety of routes have appeared on the market. These drugs have been studied mainly for their effects on primary pulmonary hypertension or hypertension associated with connective-tissue diseases. Few trials have assessed their efficacy in patients with CTPH, however. We report 2 cases of CTPH in which thromboendarterectomy was rejected. Neither of the patients responded to the conventional treatment of anticoagulants, diuretics, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but they did respond very well clinically, hemodynamically, and functionally to an inhaled prostacyclin analog, iloprost. We discuss the effects of iloprost in patients with CTPH, its mechanism of action, and its use as a potential pharmacological alternative to thromboendarterectomy. We also discuss new pulmonary vasodilators in general.", 
    "29": "Diabetic nephropathy has become the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease in the USA, Europe and Japan. The earliest marker of incipient diabetic nephropathy is the transition of normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria at an albumin excretion rate of 20 microg/min. Human studies in patients both with and without diabetic kidney diseases have shown that the severity of baseline proteinuria is an important predictor of the rate of loss of renal function. Moreover, the reduction in protein excretion rate when patients with nephropathies are being treated with antihypertensive agents predicts the efficacy of subsequent renoprotection. Experimental and clinical observations provide the rationale for targeting the renin-angiotensin system as a renoprotective approach in diabetic and nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies. Losartan (Cozaar, Merck Sharpe and Dohme) is a potent, orally active and highly specific angiotensin-type 1 receptor blocker. In addition to its antihypertensive efficacy, losartan decreases the left ventricular mass index in patients with hypertension, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume in subjects with heart failure and prevents cardiovascular morbidity and death, predominantly stroke, independent of blood pressure reduction. Short-term studies in Type 1 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy have demonstrated that losartan and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have similar beneficial effects on albumin excretion rate, blood pressure and renal hemodynamics. Losartan also lowered albumin excretion rate in microalbuminuric patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the large multicenter Reduction of End points in Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial has shown that blockade of angiotensin-type 1 receptor with losartan is superior to conventional antihypertensive therapy in slowing the progression of overt Type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Together, data from clinical trials demonstrate the beneficial effect of angiotensin-type 1 receptor blockers, including losartan, in the primary and secondary prevention of renal disease progression in diabetic patients. Nevertheless, it can be expected that the positive results achieved so far with this class of drugs may be further implemented by including angiotensin-type 1 receptor antagonists as a part of the multidrug approach that may hold more promise for the future of renoprotection in diabetic patients with chronic nephropathy.", 
    "30": "There is a growing body of literature concerning the contribution of hemostatic factors to the development of cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms of the coagulation/fibrinolytic system are complicated and one factor is intimately interrelated with another; thus the contribution of each factor cannot be clearly understood, unless hemostatic factors are considered in accordance with endothelial function and vessel morphology. Although there are many clinical studies about the correlation between hemostatic factors and cardiovascular risk, the results are inconsistent and conflicting at times. Fibrinogen and D-dimer are associated with atherosclerosis or coronary events across multiple studies, even after multivariate adjustment. But the hemostatic factors are intimately correlated, so it can be said that focusing on one to the exclusion of others is inappropriate. The clinical trials with statins or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have shown favorable effects on the prognosis of cardiovascular disease. The study of hemostatic factors in relation to these drugs has provided insights into understanding how these drugs produce beneficial effects.", 
    "31": "We evaluated the potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) to modulate resting coronary vasomotor tone and endothelial dysfunction, and to decrease vascular oxidative stress and endothelin (ET)-1 activity in human heart transplant recipients.", 
    "32": "Coronary vasomotor responses and transcardiac metabolism of glutathione, oxidized glutathione, and ET-1 were determined before and after quinaprilat infusion in 32 heart transplant recipients. Furthermore, the potential effects of ACEI on endothelial oxidative stress, ET-1 activity, and nitrosoglutathione formation were investigated using endothelial cell cultures.", 
    "33": "Epicardial diameter increased in response to quinaprilat by 6% +/- 1% (proximal segments; P<0.05) and 14% +/- 3% (distal segments; P<0.01). Coronary flow velocity increased by 2.2 +/- 0.2 (P<0.03). Coronary vasodilation to quinaprilat was negatively correlated with preexisting functional and structural coronary alterations. Quinaprilat selectively improved epicardial vasomotor response in segments with endothelial dysfunction, whereas microvascular endothelial dysfunction was unchanged. Transcardiac glutathione and big ET levels decreased after quinaprilat, whereas oxidized glutathione and ET-1 concentrations remained unchanged. Cell culture studies showed antioxidative effects of quinaprilat, revealed concentration-dependent down-regulation of endothelial ET-1 release, and indicated formation of nitrosoglutathione by quinaprilat. CONCLUSION.: ACE regulates resting coronary vasomotor tone. Quinaprilat reduces vascular oxidative stress and ET-1 activity and mediates formation of nitrosoglutathione, effects that might contribute to long-term vasculoprotective effects of ACEI after heart transplantation.",

    "35": "The STOP-Hypertension-2 study evaluated cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in elderly hypertensives comparing treatment with conventional drugs (diuretics, beta-blockers) with that of newer ones [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists]. In all, 6614 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age 76.0 years, range 70-84 years at baseline) were included in STOP-Hypertension-2. In the present subgroup analysis of STOP-Hypertension-2, isolated systolic hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure at least 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure below 95 mmHg, in accordance with the Syst-Eur and Syst-China study criteria. In total, 2280 patients in STOP-Hypertension-2 met these criteria. In the study, patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: \"conventional\" antihypertensive therapy with beta-blockers or diuretics (atenolol 50 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, pindolol 5 mg, or fixed-ratio hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride 2.5 mg daily); ACE inhibitors (enalapril 10 mg or lisinopril 10 mg daily); or calcium antagonists (felodipine 2.5 mg or isradipine 2.5 mg daily). Analysis was by intention to treat.",

Prevention of cardiovascular mortality, the primary endpoint of the study, did not differ between the three treatment groups. All stroke events, i.e. fatal and non-fatal stroke together, were significantly reduced by 25% in the newer-drugs group compared with the conventional group (95% CI 0.58-0.97; p=0.027). This difference was attributable to reduction of non-fatal stroke while fatal stroke events did not differ between groups. New cases of atrial fibrillation were significantly increased by 43% (95% CI 1.02-1.99; p=0.037) on \"newer\" drugs compared with \"conventional\" therapy, mainly attributable to the calcium antagonists. There were no significant differences between the three treatment groups with respect to the risks of myocardial infarction, sudden death or congestive heart failure.",

Current acute ischemic stroke guidelines suggest that unless systolic BP exceeds an cutoff of 220 mmHg or diastolic exceeds 120 mmHq, it should be tolerated, except in planned thrombolytic therapy. In case of hemorragic stroke, the cutoff should be of 185/110 mmHg. Prudence suggests that BP should be lowered carefully. In secondary prevention of stroke, the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) demonstrated that a blood pressure-lowering regimen, involving a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic, reduced the risks of stroke of 28% and of other major vascular events of 26% among individuals with a history of cerebrovascular disease.

Patients were identified from echocardiography laboratory logs. Despite a presumed contraindication to ACE inhibitor use in AS patients, 30% (71 of 235) of patients otherwise meeting inclusion or exclusion criteria were excluded owing to current ACE inhibitor use.

    "60": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is an octapeptide with a central role in cardiovascular homeostasis and actions in several organs including the adrenal gland, kidney, brain, heart, smooth muscle cells and sympathetic nervous system. At these levels it is involved in cellular proliferation and apoptosis, cellular migration, inflammation, synthesis and release of various mediators such as platelet-derived growth factor and endothelin-1) and in the synthesis of extracellular matrix. Traditionally, Ang II was considered a systemic hormone regulating blood pressure, aldosterone release and sodium reabsorption. However, nowadays it is known that this mediator is also formed at the tissue level in the brain, kidney and heart, suggesting local paracrine and autocrine action. At the vascular level, with the exception of renin, all other components of this system are locally produced in vascular adventitia, smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells. In the heart all the components have also been found and their response to humoral, nervous and mechanical stimuli suggests a working local system. Ang II exerts its biological action through two main receptor subtypes: AT-1 and AT-2. The AT-1 receptor is responsible for many of the physiological effects of Ang II in cardiac, vascular, kidney, brain and endocrine cells. Expression of the AT-2 receptor is higher in fetal tissue, especially in mesenchymal tissue (like the tongue, endoderm and diaphragm), decreasing after birth. Its effects are frequently opposite to those mediated bt the AT-1 receptor. Its role in cardiovascular pathophysiology is not yet established. Ang II recruits a complex cascade of intracellular second messengers with different patterns of temporal activation: immediate (in seconds), early (in minutes) and late (in hours). Clinical trials using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and AT-1 receptor antagonists (ARA) have shown improvement in morbidity and mortality in hypertension, congestive heart failure and after myocardial infarction. Although many of the mechanisms underlying these actions are not fully understood, there are no doubts about the beneficial effects of inhibiting this system in the treatment of several cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "61": "Renal disease is the most important long-term complication of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). A comparative study of renal function was carried out in two groups of patients. Group 1 included 19 children followed for a median of 11 years, 1960-1980, with a low-sodium diet, antihypertensive drugs, and a restricted protein intake in the end stage of renal disease. Group 2 included 26 children treated for a median of 9 years, 1988-2002, on a low-sodium diet, early restriction of protein intake according to recommendations, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). Long-term renal function was assessed by the inverse of the plasma creatinine concentration (1/[Cr]) over time. Linear regression lines were fitted to individual values of 1/[Cr] for each child. Regression coefficients of children in group 1 were all negative, ranging from -0.031 to -0.00043; 7 were significantly different from zero, indicating a linear fall in renal function over time. In contrast, children from group 2 had 11 negative slopes (only 1 significant) and 15 positive slopes, ranging from 0.17893 to -0.3899. Fisher's exact test showed that group 1 had significantly more children with negative slopes than group 2. This comparatively better long-term outcome of renal function in children under contemporary treatment was probably associated with early restriction of protein and use of ACEi.",

The Canadian Acute Coronary Syndromes Registry was a prospective observational study of patients admitted with suspected acute coronary syndromes. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes were recorded. At 1 year, vital status, medication use, recurrent cardiac events, and procedures were determined by telephone contact. Of the 5,312 patients enrolled, 4,627 had a final diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, with Q-wave myocardial infarction in 27.7%, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in 33.2%, and unstable angina pectoris in 39.1%. During hospitalization, coronary angiography and revascularization were performed in 39.6% and 20.3% of patients, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was 2.4% overall. At discharge, 87.8%, 76.4%, 56.0%, and 54.8% of patients were prescribed aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents, respectively. Unadjusted 1-year mortality rates for hospital survivors were 6.5%, 10%, and 5.4% for those with Q-wave myocardial infarction, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, and unstable angina pectoris groups, respectively (p <0.0001). This difference in mortality rate remained significant after adjusting for other prognosticators, whereas the use of coronary angiography and revascularization after discharge was similar across patients. At 1 year, fewer patients were maintained on aspirin and beta blockers, whereas the use of lipid-lowering therapy increased (all p <0.0001). Despite similar rates of coronary angiography and revascularization after discharge, patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction had worse outcomes at 1 year. Moreover, there was a significant opportunity to enhance the discharge and long-term use of evidence-based secondary prevention therapies.", 
    "76": "Whether antecedent systemic hypertension influences the risk of subsequent left ventricular (LV) dilation in patients after an acute myocardial infarction with LV systolic dysfunction is unclear. We assessed echocardiographic evidence of ventricular remodeling from baseline (mean +/- SD 11 +/- 3 days) to 2 years after an acute myocardial infarction in 122 hypertensive (defined as a history of treated hypertension, baseline systolic blood pressure > or =140 or baseline diastolic blood pressure > or =90 mm Hg) and 334 nonhypertensive patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement echocardiographic substudy. Compared with nonhypertensives, baseline heart size, defined as the sum of the average short- and long-axis LV cavity areas, was similar (70.1 +/- 11.9 vs 68.8 +/- 11.2 cm(2), p = 0.33 at end-diastole; 50.1 +/- 11.3 vs 48.8 +/- 10.8 cm(2), p = 0.31 at end-systole), but short-axis LV myocardial area (24.7 +/- 4.3 vs 25.7 +/- 5.0 cm(2), p = 0.043) and wall thickness (1.15 +/- 0.16 vs 1.21 +/- 0.17 cm, p = 0.004) at end-diastole were greater among hypertensives. The myocardial infarct segment lengths were similar in the 2 groups (p = 0.22). Although LV cavity areas increased significantly in the 2 groups from baseline to 2 years (p < or =0.001), the increase was significantly greater in hypertensives than in nonhypertensives (+5.6 +/- 11.5 vs +2.2 +/- 10.7 cm(2), p = 0.005 at end-diastole; +6.23 +/- 12.75 vs +2.94 +/- 11.4 cm(2), p = 0.012 at end-systole). There was no concomitant difference in the change in LV myocardial area or LV wall thickness between the 2 groups (p >0.30). After adjusting for known confounders, antecedent hypertension was associated with a doubling of the risk of LV dilation (50.8% vs 37.7%, odds ratio 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 3.45, p = 0.004). This association was not modified by diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarct segment length, or captopril use (all p values for interaction >0.10). We conclude that antecedent hypertension is associated with subsequent LV dilation in patients after acute myocardial infarction with LV systolic dysfunction.",

We report a 39-year-old woman with previous history of recurrent thrombosis diagnosed as primary antiphospholipid syndrome, who presented malignant hypertension in the context of a renal artery thrombosis. She had a high IgG anticardiolipin antibody titre and positive lupus anticoagulant. An isotopic renogram demonstrated asymmetrical activity (60% right vs 40% left kidney).

Among these situations are hypertensive emergencies, hypertensive urgencies, hypertensive encephalopathy, and also accelerated-malignant hypertension characterised by the presence of grade 3 or grade 4 Keith-Wagener retinopathy and numerous complications (acute renal failure, heart failure, haemorrhagic brain stroke or acute coronary events). Despite of antihypertensive therapy, the mortality rate of accelerated-malignant hypertension is about 25% after the 5th year. We present the case of a thirty-three years old male, with a five-year history of non-treated hypertension, who develops accelerated- hypertension with heart failure, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and renal failure that requires renal replacement therapy. After a strict control of blood pressure; initially using parenteral agents such as Solinitrin and Urapidil, followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and Hydralazine, the patient partially recovers his renal function, resulting in the withdrawal of haemodialysis.",

Then, oral cyclosporine A (3.5 mg/kg/day) was given and after 5 weeks of treatment, remission of the nephrotic syndrome was observed but creatinine raised to 1.6 mg/dl, normalizing after reducing the dose of cyclosporine A. We discuss the settings, prognostic and therapeutic alternatives for idiopathic membranous nephropathy.",

Mineralocorticoid antagonists have emerged as a new paradigm for the treatment of congestive heart failure. They have established benefits among patients with chronic symptomatic systolic dysfunction, and recent studies have demonstrated substantial effect on the morbidity and mortality among patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction. The exact biologic mechanism is thus far unknown.", 
    "85": "Within the last 5 years, efforts have intensified to help define better the biologic mechanisms by which mineralocorticoid receptor antagonisms exert the observed clinical benefit. Elegant human studies have demonstrated some important observations. First, under conditions of increased plasma aldosterone concentrations, the heart will extract aldosterone. Second, aldosterone extraction in the heart stimulates increased collagen turnover culminating in ventricular remodeling. Third, among people with chronic systolic or diastolic heart failure, aldosterone is actually produced and secreted by the heart. Finally, antagonism of the mineralocorticoid receptor will attenuate or abrogate many of these deleterious effects.", 
    "86": "Combined clinical and detailed mechanistic investigations have established mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism as the new treatment paradigm for congestive heart failure. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that treatment of patients with a combination of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism (eplerenone) and angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor (ACE-I) results in substantial reduction in left ventricular mass. Furthermore, a federally funded initiative to treat more than 6000 patients with diastolic heart failure with spironolactone is in its final phases of planning. It is foreseeable that, along with ACE-I and beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism will become part of the treatment paradigm for people across the entire spectrum of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "87": "Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is widely believed to be an endogenous nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor. However, in this study, we examined our hypothesis that the long-term vascular effects of ADMA are not mediated by inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis.", 
    "88": "ADMA was infused in wild-type and eNOS-knockout (KO) mice by osmotic minipump for 4 weeks. In wild-type mice, long-term treatment with ADMA caused significant coronary microvascular lesions. Importantly, in eNOS-KO mice, treatment with ADMA also caused an extent of coronary microvascular lesions that was comparable to that in wild-type mice. These vascular effects of ADMA were not prevented by supplementation of l-arginine, and vascular NO production was not reduced by ADMA treatment. Treatment with ADMA caused upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and an increase in superoxide production that were comparable in both strains and that were abolished by simultaneous treatment with temocapril (ACE inhibitor) or olmesartan (AT(1) receptor antagonist), which simultaneously suppressed vascular lesion formation.", 
    "89": "These results provide the first direct evidence that the long-term vascular effects of ADMA are not solely mediated by simple inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis. Direct upregulation of ACE and increased oxidative stress through AT(1) receptor appear to be involved in the long-term vascular effects of ADMA in vivo. This study demonstrates that asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) causes arteriosclerotic coronary lesions in mice in vivo through mechanisms other than simple inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis. Our findings should contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological role of ADMA in arteriosclerosis.",

    "91": "Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, with damage to arteries as a major contributing factor. Arterial stiffness is a factor associated with high systolic and pulse pressure in these patients and is a strong independent factor associated with morbidity and mortality. Arterial stiffness is one of the principal factors opposing left ventricular ejection. The appropriate term to define the arterial factor(s) opposing left ventricular ejection is aortic input impedance. Aortic input impedance depends on TPR, arterial distensibility, and wave reflections. Distensibility defines the capacitive properties of arterial stiffness, whose role it is to dampen pressure and flow oscillations and to transform pulsatile flow and pressure in arteries into a steady flow and pressure in peripheral tissues. Stiffness is the reciprocal value of distensibility. These parameters are blood pressure dependent; arteries become stiffer at high pressure. While distensibility provides information about the elasticity of the artery as a hollow structure, the elastic incremental modulus characterizes the properties of the arterial wall biomaterials independent of vessel geometry. Alternatively, arterial distensibility can be evaluated by measuring pulse wave velocity, which increases with the stiffening of arteries. Arterial stiffening increases left ventricular afterload and alters the coronary perfusion. With increased pulse wave velocity, the wave reflections affects the aorta during systole, which increases systolic pressures and myocardial oxygen consumption and decreases diastolic blood pressure and coronary flow. The arterial stiffness is altered primarily in association with increased collagen content and alterations of extracellular matrix and calcification of the arterial wall. The arterial stiffening estimated by changes in aortic pulse wave velocity and intensity of wave reflections are independent predictors of survival in end-stage renal disease and in the general population. Improvement of arterial stiffening could be obtained by antihypertensive treatments as observed with calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors increase AC and reduce wave reflections. It has been shown that reversibility of aortic stiffening and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had a favorable independent effect on survival in hypertensive patients with advanced renal disease.", 
    "92": "Elevated arterial pressure had long been surmised from the strength of the pulse. Its association with contracted kidneys and hypertrophied hearts was described by Richard Bright (1789-1858). Microscopic observations of the narrowed and obliterated vasculature initially observed in the kidneys of Bright's disease, and subsequently throughout the body, launched clinical research into hypertension. The description of these findings in the absence of symptoms of kidney disease led to the recognition of primary hypertension. Ultimately, the systematic recording of the blood pressure with a pneumatic cuff and mercury manometer established the significance of hypertension as a distinct disease entity. Subsequent experimental studies established the central role of the kidney in hypertension through the renin-angiotensin system and extracellular volume control. This finding provided the basis for the introduction of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, two of the most important and valuable antihypertertensive drugs now available. Thus, the study of kidney disease and function has played a pivotal role in the conceptual evolution of the understanding of hypertension as a disease, the identification of its mechanisms, and the development of clinically useful antihypertensive medications.",

Isoprostanes were normalized after zofenopril treatment (P <.03), whereas enalapril was ineffective. After treatment with both ACE inhibitors, plasma NOx concentrations were significantly reduced (P <.05). Similarly, hypertension increased ADMA concentration compared with the normotensive state, whereas ACE inihibition elicited a significant decrease. However, the reduction of ADMA concentration was significantly higher in patients receiving sulfhydryl ACE inhibition (P <.05 vs enalapril).",

    "105": "Heart failure (HF) affects >5 million patients in the United States, and its prevalence is increasing every year. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers reduce hospitalizations and mortality rates in patients with HF, these lifesaving therapies continue to be underused. Several studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of eligible patients with HF are not receiving treatment with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies. In patients hospitalized with HF, who are at particularly high risk for re-hospitalization and death, the initiation of beta-blockers is often delayed because of concern that early initiation of these agents may exacerbate HF. Recent studies suggest that beta-blockers can be safely and effectively initiated in patients with HF before hospital discharge and that clinical outcomes are improved. The Initiation Management Predischarge Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy for Heart Failure (IMPACT-HF) trial demonstrated that pre-discharge initiation of carvedilol was associated with a higher rate of beta-blocker use after hospital discharge, with no increase in hospital length of stay. In addition, there was no increase in the risk of worsening of HF. Studies of hospital-based management systems that rely on early (pre-discharge) initiation of evidence-based therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease have also found increases in post-discharge use of therapy and a reduction in the rates of mortality and hospitalization. On the basis of these pivotal studies, the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) program is designed to improve medical care and education of hospitalized patients with HF and accelerate the initiation of evidence-based HF guideline recommended therapies by administering them before hospital discharge. A registry component, planned as the most comprehensive database of the hospitalized HF population focusing on admission to discharge and 60- to 90-day follow-up, is designed to evaluate the demographic, pathophysiologic, clinical, treatment, and outcome characteristics of patients hospitalized with HF. The ultimate aim of this program is to improve the standard of HF care in the hospital and outpatient settings and increase the use of evidence-based therapeutic strategies to save lives.", 
    "106": "Regardless of the underlying pathological mechanisms oxidative stress seems to be present in all forms of hypertension. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that chronic presence of high pressure itself elicits increased arterial O(2)(.-) production. Hypertension was induced in rats by abdominal aortic banding (Ab). Rats with Ab had elevated pressure in vessels proximal and normal pressure in vessels distal to the coarctation, yet both vascular beds were exposed to the same circulating factors. Compared to normotensive hind limb arteries (HLAs) hypertensive forelimb arteries (FLAs) exhibited 1) impaired dilations to acetylcholine and the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine that were restored by administration of superoxide dismutase; 2) an increased production of O(2)(.-) (measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence and ethidium bromide fluorescence) that was inhibited or reduced by superoxide dismutase, the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin, or the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors chelerythrine and staurosporine or by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril; and 3) increased ACE activity. In organ culture, exposure of isolated arteries of normotensive rats to high pressure (160 mmHg, for 24 hours) significantly increased O(2)(.-) production compared to that in arteries exposed to 80 mmHg. High pressure-induced O(2)(.-) generation was reduced by inhibitors of ACE and PKC. Incubation of cultured arteries with angiotensin II elicited significantly increased O(2)(.-) generation that was inhibited by chelerythrine. Thus, we propose that chronic presence of high pressure itself can elicit arterial oxidative stress, primarily by activating directly a PKC-dependent NAD(P)H oxidase pathway, but also, in part, via activation of the local renin-angiotensin system.",

The present study was undertaken to investigate whether PAI 4G/5G and ACE I/D polymorphisms are independent risk factors for RVO and whether they account for elevated PAI-1 activity levels. We studied 112 RVO patients (52 males and 60 females; range 18-83 years; median age 60 years) and 112 healthy subjects (52 males and 60 females; range 20-84 years; median age 57 years). PAI-1 activity was determined by a chromogenic assay and ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction length fragment polymorphism (RLFP) methods. Elevated PAI-1 activity (above 95(th) percentile of the controls) was significantly associated with RVO at multivariate analysis after adjustment for age, sex, traditional cardiovascular risk factors and haemostasis-related risk factors (OR = 4.93, 95% CI 1.70-14.30; p = 0.003). The homozygosity for ACE DD was found to be an independent risk factor for RVO at multivariate analysis (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.01-3.83; p = 0.049), whereas no significant association between homozygosity for PAI-1 4G4G and risk of RVO was observed. Subjects carrying both ACE DD genotype and PAI-1 4G4G genotype showed an increased risk for RVO at multivariate analysis (OR = 4.82, 95% CI 1.89-12.29; p = 0.001). In 45/112 patients without the established risk factors for RVO (hyper-tension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes) or characteristics known to be associated to increased PAI-1 activity (overweight, hypertriglyceridemia, and smoking habit) the contemporary presence of ACE DD and PAI-1 4G4G genotype was significantly associated with a risk for RVO (OR = 8.26, 95% CI 1.18-57.92; p = 0.034). In conclusion, in our study: 1-indicates that ACE DD genotype is a risk factor for RVO in the whole group of patients, and in the subgroup of patients without the established risk factors for RVO or characteristics influencing the PAI-1 activity, when associated to PAI-1 4G4G genotype, and 2-confirms the role of hypofibrinolysis, documented by high levels of PAI-1 activity, in the occurrence of patients with RVO.",

    "118": "Locally generated angiotensin II (AngII) may be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of chronic renal diseases. Renal expression of AngII and other components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in a model of chronic progressive nephropathy induced by inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis. Renal injury was evaluated by histology and albumin excretion. Systemic RAS status was evaluated through plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma AngII concentration. In addition, the effects of enalapril, losartan, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on AngII expression in animals with chronic renal disease was also analyzed. Plasma renin activity and plasma AngII were not different between rats with nephropathy and controls (2.08 +/- 0.7 versus 2.03 +/- 0.5 ng/ml/h and 94.3 +/- 18 versus 78.9 +/- 16 fmol/ml, respectively). However, rats with chronic progressive nephropathy showed augmented renal content of angiotensinogen protein (13.5 +/- 3.5 versus 2.2 +/- 0.4 pixels in control rats; P < 0.05), enhanced expression of cathepsin D-a renin-like enzyme-in cortical collecting tubules (103.5 +/- 27.0 versus 66.2 +/- 3.6 cells/mm2 in controls; P < 0.01), and increased expression of AT1 receptor in interstitium (54.7 +/- 7.8 versus 1.3 +/- 0.4 cells/mm2 in controls; P < 0.001). Kidney angiotensin-converting enzyme content did not differ among the groups. Notably, an increased number of interstitial cells expressing AngII was detected in the renal interstitium (9.5 +/- 1.6 versus 1.7 +/- 0.6 cells/mm2 in controls; P < 0.05). Rats treated with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-esther and losartan presented a decreased local AngII formation, in contrast to its known effect on plasma AngII. Moreover, mycophenolate mofetil lowered interstitial AngII expression, suggesting that inflammatory signaling may be involved in interstitial AngII generation. This study demonstrates the upregulation of local RAS in the kidney in a model of chronic progressive nephropathy.", 
    "119": "Heart failure is associated with neurohormonal activation, including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Plasma aldosterone levels are elevated in patients with heart failure in spite of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers because of angiotensin-independent stimuli for aldosterone production. In addition to its long recognized role in sodium retention, aldosterone has a number of other deleterious effects, including the increase in myocardial and vascular fibrosis and myocardial remodeling in patients with heart failure. Based on strong clinical trial data, low-dose aldosterone receptor blockers are recommended to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with severe chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and in patients with heart failure associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction, and in patients already on standard therapy including ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers) and beta blockers. In view of the potential for serious hyperkalemia with the use of aldosterone receptor blockers, it is essential to monitor serum potassium closely and to adjust the dose of aldosterone antagonists based on serum potassium levels. Close adherence to the dosing regimens used in the clinical trials (RALES and EPHESUS ) is recommended. These agents should not be initiated in patients with severe renal insufficiency and closer monitoring is warranted in those with mild to moderate renal insufficiency or diabetes.", 
    "120": "Left ventricular (LV) remodeling refers to alterations in ventricular mass, chamber size, and shape that result from myocardial injury, pressure, or volume overload. Numerous studies have demonstrated that LV remodeling correlates with the incidence of heart failure and death, supporting a causative role for remodeling in heart failure progression. Heart failure trials have shown that neurohormonal antagonists, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta blockers), reduce remodeling in parallel with improved clinical outcomes. Existing data favor using angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists (or \"ARBs\"), although their anti-remodeling effects are less well established. Recently, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have gained substantial interest based on favorable clinical trial results, although data regarding their effects on remodeling are limited. Thus, an optimal medical regimen to prevent or limit LV remodeling in patients with LV dysfunction should include both an ACE inhibitor and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, irrespective of the degree of LV dysfunction and symptom status. For patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors, an AT1 receptor antagonist should be substituted. An aldosterone antagonist should be administered to patients with severe, New York Heart Association class III to IV heart failure who have normal or only mildly impaired renal function, or to those patients with depressed LV function following an acute myocardial infarction. Through the aggressive pharmacologic inhibition of both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, progressive LV remodeling can be prevented or hindered, thereby favorably altering the natural history of the heart failure syndrome.",

    "147": "RXPA380 (Cbz-PhePsi[PO(2)CH]Pro-Trp-OH) was reported recently as the first highly selective inhibitor of the C-domain of somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), able to differentiate the two active sites of somatic ACE by a selectivity factor of more than 3 orders of magnitude. The contribution of each RXPA380 residue toward this remarkable selectivity was evaluated by studying several analogues of RXPA380. This analysis revealed that both pseudo-proline and tryptophan residues in the P(1)' and P(2)' positions of RXPA380 play a critical role in the selectivity of this inhibitor for the C-domain. This selectivity is not due to a preference of the C-domain for inhibitors bearing pseudo-proline and tryptophan residues, but rather reflects the poor accommodation of these inhibitor residues by the N-domain. A model of RXPA380 in complex with the ACE C-domain, based on the crystal structure of germinal ACE, highlights residues that may contribute to RXPA380 selectivity. From this model, striking differences between the N- and C-domains of ACE are observed for residues defining the S(2)' pocket. Of the twelve residues that surround the tryptophan side chain of RXPA380 in the C-domain, five are different in the N-domain. These differences in the S(2)' composition between the N- and C-domains are suggested to contribute to RXPA380 selectivity. The structural insights provided by this study should enhance understanding of the factors controlling the selectivity of the two domains of somatic ACE and allow the design of new selective ACE inhibitors.",

    "149": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease with explicit complications on coronary vascular system. The incidence of coronary disease is rising in type 1 as well as in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it is caused by precipitating atherosclerosis. It is unquestionable that disorders of different metabolic pathways cause acute coronary syndrome, the same holding true for postinfarction complications. Strict blood glucose control (glucose value should be close to the physiologic values) is imperative not only in the prevention but also in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and prevention of reinfarction. It is obvious that medicamentous and surgical treatment of coronary heart disease in diabetic patients can reduce morbidity and mortality. The treatment of acute coronary heart syndrome in diabetic patients is very similar to that in nondiabetic patients, however, it demands extra efforts to establish good metabolic control. Due to more than one narrowing of coronary arteries in diabetic patients, angioplasty is often less efficient and there is a need of specific evaluation by a cardio-cardio surgical team to choose the method of treatment: stent implantation or arterial bypass. The strategy of optimal revascularization for diabetic patients who have multivascular coronary heart disease is still controversial. Although data on early percutaneous or surgical revascularization show longterm benefit, the early studies were carried out before the extensive use of intracoronary stents and thrombocyte inhibitors GP IIb/IIa. A dilemma about this question showed up when excellent results of drug eluting intracoronary stents brought up credibility of compared studies. For best patient selection, it has been recommended that decision should be based more on coronary anatomy rather than the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Surgical revascularization (CAGB) should be considered in patients with diabetes mellitus who have stenosis of the left main coronary artery, significant diffuse stenosis involving each of epicardial vessels, and patients who have mild to significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients with a relatively focal nature of the disease and free from left main coronary artery or confluence of front left descendent artery could be considered for PCI (primary coronary intervention). When stents become widely available, patients would probably request PCI first instead of CABG. It is very important to remember that irrespective of PCI or CABG being preferred in diabetic patients, the role of drug therapy is enormous. Due to the diabetic patient susceptibility to fast progression of the disease and plaque rupture, drug therapy is indispensable in this population, e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglytaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA) inhibitor reductase and ACE-inhibitor.", 
    "150": "Angiotensin II (AT II) is a final product of the renin-anglotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) and presents one of the most influential factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial dysfunction and heart failure. ACE-inhibitors (ACEI), beside beta adrenergic blockers, are a cornerstone of the current chronic heart failure (CHF) treatment. Evidence based medicine has not yet proved any significant beneficial effects of ACEI in patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP), although according to the SoLVD study testing the possible effects of ACEI in patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction and/or CHF, there was a significant hospitalization rate reduction as well as less transformation of UAP to myocardial infarction in patients treated with ACEI. In the GISSI 3, ISIS 4 and CCS studies, ACEI was given within the first 24 hours and continued for 4-6 weeks. According to pooled results, ACE inhibitor could save 11/1000 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and only 1/1000 patients with non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In the SAVE, AIRE and TRACE studies, ACEI was started later, i.e. 3-16 days after acute myocardial infarction and continued for several years. ACEI therapy resulted in a significantly lower mortality during the first year, and an even 20% relative reduction in the total mortality during the 4-year follow up. The effects of ACEI were even more prominent in more severe myocardial dysfunction, as it was well known that they could slow or stop unfavorable myocardial remodeling. Conclusively, ACEI should be given as early as possible to all patients with acute myocardial infarction, if no contraindications. The HOPE study showed efficacy of ACEI in the primary prevention of ischemic heart disease in high risk individuals, and the EUROPA study showed a favorable effect of ACEI in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease in low risk patients. According to these findings, ACEI should be given permenantly following myocardial infarction. These findings suggest the need of a permanent treatment with ACEI in patients having sustaned myocardial infarction. Angiotensin-1 receptor antagonists (AT-1 antagonists) are a newer generation of neurohormonal antagonists, which block the effects of AT II produced not only through a classic, ACE-dependent pathway but also via alternative pathways (non ACE-dependent) and selectively bind to AT-1 receptors for AT II. Therefore, they have some theoretical advances in comparison with ACEI. There are 2 relevant studies elucidating their possible role in treating patients with or post-myocardial infarction. The OPTIMAAL study did not prove losartan to be better than an ACEI (captopril), while the VALIANT study showed that the effects of valsartan vs. captopril were statistically nonsignificantly different. Furthermore, there is no sense to combine AT-1 antagonist and ACEI, while a combination of AT-1 antagonist and a beta blocker is justified. In other words, AT-1 antagonist (the class effect is disputable) should be given to patients with acute myocardial infarction or to post-myocardial infarction patients who cannot take ACEI.",

    "152": "The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II (ATII) receptor antagonist therapy of diabetic nephropathy (DNP) are thought to be largely the result of attenuation of ATII effects on proteinuria. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether there is the additive anti-proteinuric effect of enalapril plus losartan in DNP. Twenty-two patients with DNP were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to enalapril 10 mg/day (11 patients) or losartan 50 mg/day (11 patients) administered in a single oral dose in the morning for 12 weeks. and then, in 10 patients (five patients from enalapril group and five patients from losartan group), combination therapy (10 mg/day enalapril and 50 mg/day losartan) was started and continued for 12 weeks. In 12 patients, initial drugs dosages were doubled (six patients 20 mg/day enalapril and six patients 100 mg/day losartan), and monotherapy was continued for 12 weeks. Blood pressure and proteinuria were measured before and after therapy. Adverse effects were recorded at every visit. Proteinuria decreased by 33% with enalapril and losartan administered alone (p < 0.05). Co-administration of enalapril and losartan decreased proteinuria by a greater extent compared with enalapril and losartan administered alone (51%, p<0.05). This proteinuria level was significantly lower than the proteinuria level of 12 weeks therapy with enalapril and losartan alone. The decrease of proteinuria was 37% in double-dose monotherapy group (p < 0.05). Reduction of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in co-administration of enalapril and losartan was higher than enalapril and losartan administered alone (p < 0.05). Combination of enalapril and losartan decreased proteinuria and MAP by a greater extent compared with enalapril and losartan administered alone. We have found that proteinuria reduction induced by combined therapy is maintained throughout short-term follow-up; a greater anti-proteinuric response was observed in the patients with DNP.", 
    "153": "The prevalence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) has been increasing among the women in developed countries. The well recognized IHD excess in men has often obscured the fact that IHD is the leading cause of death in women. Women have atypical symptoms of IHD that lead to a delay in the diagnosis and an overall poor prognosis. Women have a delay in the onset of IHD due to the beneficial effects of their sex hormones. Postmenopausal women lose this beneficial effect of estrogen and undergo significant changes in their lipid profile, arterial pressure, glucose tolerance, and vascular reactivity that increase their risk for development of IHD. Recently there has been considerable interest in the sex hormones and their role in IHD in women. The general belief that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has an overall beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women and hence decreases CVD mortality and morbidity has not been shown in the recent multicenter prospective studies. With the availability of various types of estrogen and progestins, physicians prescribing these agents should take into consideration their varying effects on the cardiovascular system. Risk factor modifications should include diet, weight loss, regular exercise, smoking cessation and adequate control of hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM) and hyperlipidemia. In the appropriate setting, treatment with proven beneficial agents like aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins will help decrease the burden of IHD in women.", 
    "154": "The vasoactive peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) has been implicated as a mediator of myocardial fibrosis. We carried out a comparative investigation of the effects of Ang II and its precursor Ang I on collagen metabolism and proliferation in cultured human cardiac fibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts responded to both Ang I and Ang II with concentration-dependent increases in collagen synthesis but no proliferation. The stimulatory effect of Ang II was abolished by the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan but not the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319. The response to Ang I was not affected by either antagonist, nor by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. In conclusion, Both Ang I and Ang II stimulate collagen synthesis of human cardiac fibroblasts, the effect of Ang II occurring via the AT(1) receptor whilst Ang I appears to exert a direct effect through non-Ang II-dependent mechanisms. These results suggest distinct roles for angiotensin peptides in the development of cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "155": "Diastolic heart failure, a major cause of morbidity and mortality, is defined as symptoms of heart failure in a patient with preserved left ventricular function. It is characterized by a stiff left ventricle with decreased compliance and impaired relaxation, which leads to increased end diastolic pressure. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of heart failure with systolic dysfunction. The diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is best made with Doppler echocardiography. Based on current knowledge, pharmacologic treatment of diastolic heart failure should focus on normalizing blood pressure, promoting regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, avoiding tachycardia, treating symptoms of congestion, and maintaining normal atrial contraction when possible. Diuretic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for preventing pulmonary congestion, while beta blockers appear to be useful in preventing tachycardia and thereby prolonging left ventricular diastolic filling time. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers may be beneficial in patients with diastolic dysfunction, especially those with hypertension. Evidence from adequately powered randomized controlled trials, however, is not available yet. The outcomes of ongoing clinical trials may provide much-needed information to move from intuitive treatment to therapy based on evidence that matters: decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life.",

Whereas progress has been made in understanding the glycosylation pathways of IgA1 O-linked glycans and binding galactose-deficient IgA1-complexes to mesangial cells, there is still no IgA nephropathy-specific therapy. The current approach to suppress the effects of angiotensin II, by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers, or both, as a cornerstone of the therapy of IgA nephropathy has been strengthened by recent studies. Treatment with glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, or both, may be appropriate for a subset of IgA nephropathy patients.", 
    "158": "A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the synthesis of galactose-deficient IgA1, the formation of circulating immune complexes, and interactions with mesangial cells will provide further insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms that culminate in the glomerular and interstitial damage of IgA nephropathy, and could identify novel therapeutic targets in the prevention and management of this renal disease.", 
    "159": "Recent findings on the relationship between congestive heart failure and renal failure are summarized in this review.", 
    "160": "Congestive heart failure is found in about one-quarter of cases of chronic kidney disease. The most common cause of congestive heart failure is ischemic heart disease. The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases greatly as the patient's renal function deteriorates, and, at end-stage renal disease, can reach 65-70%. There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive heart failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure is often associated with a rapid fall in renal function and adequate control of congestive heart failure can prevent this. The opposite is also true: treatment of chronic kidney disease can prevent congestive heart failure. There is new evidence showing the cardioprotective effect of carvedilol in patients on dialysis, and of simvastatin and eplerenone in patients with congestive heart failure. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs doubles the rate of hospitalization in patients with congestive heart failure. Anemia has been found in one-third to half the cases of congestive heart failure, and may be caused not only by chronic kidney disease but by the congestive heart failure itself. The anemia is associated with worsening cardiac and renal status and often with signs of malnutrition. Control of the anemia and aggressive use of the recommended medication for congestive heart failure may improve the cardiac function, patient function and exercise capacity, stabilize the renal function, reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life. Congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and anemia therefore appear to act together in a vicious circle in which each condition causes or exacerbates the other. Both congestive heart failure and anemia are often undertreated. Cooperation between nephrologists and other physicians in the treatment of patients with anemic congestive heart failure may improve the quality of care and the subsequent prognosis for both congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease.",

    "162": "To review goals of antihypertensive treatment in chronic kidney disease in the context of what role calcium antagonists play toward reducing progression of kidney disease.", 
    "163": "All recently published guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease. Use of calcium antagonists is not recommended as part of the initial armamentarium. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, when used in concert with diuretics reduce blood pressure as well as both proteinuria and the rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate. The evidence for calcium antagonists in this regard is more divergent. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, e.g. amlodipine, felodipine, help achieve blood pressure goals and reduce stroke risk. When used with a renin-angiotensin system blocker they do not detract from the benefits of this blockade on slowing progression of kidney disease. Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, e.g. verpamil or diltiazem, decrease proteinuria and in studies with 5 to 6 years follow-up preserve kidney function similarly to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The reason for this outcome difference between calcium antagonists is partial preservation of renal autoregulation compared to its obliteration by the dihydropyridine subclass.", 
    "164": "Use of calcium antagonists is safe and necessary to achieve blood pressure goals in people with chronic kidney disease. While both subclasses are safe and necessary to achieve blood pressure goals, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists fail to significantly slow the progression of kidney disease among patients with established nephropathy and macroalbuminuria when compared to agents that block the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "165": "Management of hypertension, at the beginning of the new millennium, persists in being a difficult, demanding and responsible task. Beta blockers and diuretics reduce mortality, stroke and coronary disease in patients suffering from arterial hypertension. Newer antihypertensive drugs which block the renin angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), may have additional benefits in high-risk individuals with normal blood pressure. The additional benefit has been confirmed in LIFE and ANBP2 studies. In HOPE study, application of the ACE inhibitors in high-risk patients with \"normal\" BP values resulted in reduction of major cardiovascular events. Problem of adherence to therapy also continues to be one of the most important problems in management of hypertension. The success of antihypertensive management is directly proportional to the adherence to therapy. The new European guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension and JNC 7 recommendations offer a rational and effective approach to management of hypertension. These two documents contain a series of new attitudes, and reminded of some old and opened some new questions.",

Patients who developed progressive left ventricle dilatation had higher mortality then patients without changes of left ventricle volume, and mortality is due of sudden cardiac death. Drugs who had preventive effects or reverse remodelling can help in prevention of malignant arrhythhmias and sudden cardiac death. It is showed that ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists had preventive effects on left ventricle remodelling. The combined therapy with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists is showed as the most-effective in prevention of remodelling, appearaance of arrhythhmias and sudden cardiac death.",

    "208": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis occurs at the onset of enalapril-induced regression of aortic hypertrophy in SHR. A potential mechanism is the correction of endothelial dysfunction (ED) leading to reduced production of reactive oxygen species and enhanced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), a potent apoptosis inducer. Stimulants of NO include the precursor L-arginine and the NO synthase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), which correct ED in several models. The objective was to examine the relationships between ED and the cell growth/death balance during vascular remodeling induced by enalapril in SHR. SHR, 10-week-old, received enalapril (ENA: 30 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) p.o.) for 1 or 2 weeks, or a co-treatment of L-arginine (2.0 g x kg(-1) x day(-1) p.o.) and BH(4) (5.4 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) i.p. twice daily) administered alone (group: LB) or in combination with enalapril (ENA+LB) for 1 week. Controls received vehicle. After 1 week, ED was completely corrected with LB but not affected significantly by ENA, whereas both treatments failed to induce SMC apoptosis or aortic remodeling. The correction of ED and the induction of SMC apoptosis (3.3-fold increase in TUNEL labeling) required 2 weeks of ENA treatment. The combination of LB with ENA for 1 week, however, was additive for the reduction of SMC proliferation, and synergistic for the induction of apoptosis and regression of vascular hypertrophy. These interactions were independent of blood pressure regulation. Our results suggest that the correction of ED is not sufficient to induce SMC apoptosis and vascular remodeling, although it facilitates these responses during enalapril treatment.",

Identifying factors associated with the lack of uniformly high-quality health care might aid efforts to improve care. We therefore sought to determine the extent to which provider and hospital characteristics contribute to small-area geographic variation in heart failure care after controlling for patient factors.", 
    "210": "We studied 30 228 Medicare patients who were older than 65 years and hospitalized with heart failure. We mapped rates for 2 quality measures-documentation of left ventricular ejection fraction and appropriate prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors-across the United States, using a Bayesian technique that smooths rates and enhances assessment for significant patterns of small-area variation. We used nonlinear hierarchical models to assess for associations between the the quality indicators and provider and hospital characteristics independent of patient characteristics.",

After patient factors were controlled for, care at hospitals without a medical school affiliation, without invasive cardiac capabilities, or in a rural location, as well as not having a cardiologist as an attending physician, was significantly associated with lower rates of left ventricular ejection fraction documentation. Hospitalization at a nonteaching facility was significantly associated with failure to prescribe angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

    "213": "All currently available antihypertensive drugs can cause adverse drug reactions. Potential adverse drug reactions should already be taken into account when a new antihypertensive regimen is started. It is furthermore important to ask at follow-up visits specifically about common adverse reactions. The aims of this article are therefore to shortly summarise common and typical adverse drug reactions of antihypertensives. All antihypertensives may cause dizziness, hypotension, allergies, rashes, gastrointestinal complaints and dry mouth. Thiazide diuretics furthermore may cause electrolyte disturbances, dehydration and hyperuricemia, betablockers may cause bronchospasm, bradycardia, cold extremities and sleep disturbances and calcium antagonists may cause flushing, ankle oedema and gingival hyperplasia. Concerning potential lethal adverse drug reactions, it is important to know that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists are contraindicated in all patients with a history of angioedema. However, angiotensin receptor antagonists are well-suited alternatives for patients with ACE inhibitor-induced cough or hypogeusia. Rare adverse drug reactions are commonly recognised only after drug approval based on spontaneous reporting. This demonstrates the importance of considering medications as potential causes of new complaints and symptoms and to reports such suspected adverse drug reactions to the national pharmacovigilance centres. Only the local or international accumulation of comparable spontaneous reports allows the drug regulation agencies to recognise new and unexpected adverse drug reactions early and to initiate appropriate measures.", 
    "214": "In order to lower arterial blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs decrease cardiac output, total peripheral resistance or both. Diuretics, beta-blockers, and central adrenergic inhibitors decrease cardiac output. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium antagonists, alpha-blockers, central adrenergic inhibitors, and after a delay also diuretics and beta-blockers decrease peripheral resistance. Diuretics are first line therapy for treating low renin hypertension. Beta blockers are used for treating high renin hypertension and patients suffering additional coronary artery disease. ACE inihibitors can be given for treating high renin hypertension particularly in conjunction with diabetes, heart failure or left ventricular hypertrophy. Combining ACE inhibitors with diuretics potentiates the antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin II antagonists exert fewer side effects and better renal protection than ACE inhibitors. The main indication for calcium antagonists is low renin hypertension, their advantages being strong blood pressure reduction as well as in preventing stroke. Central alpha2 receptor agonists and other vasodilators are chosen only in selected cases and mostly in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "215": "The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Here we show that ACE2 expression on cell lines correlates with susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 is a major receptor for SARS-CoV. The soluble ectodomain of ACE2 specifically abrogated S-mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors. Deletion of a major portion of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 had no effect on S-driven infection, indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function. Our results point to a central role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infection and suggest a minor contribution of the cytoplasmic domain to receptor function.",

Aortic levels of phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase protein were significantly elevated in rats with CHF. In addition, phosphorylation of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2), an index of p38 MAP kinase activity, was increased. Aortic superoxide anion generation was significantly enhanced in rats with CHF accompanied by elevation of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p47phox protein expression. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by treatment with the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB239063 (800 ppm in standard rat chow) reduced MAPKAPK-2 phosphorylation, preserved acetylcholine-induced relaxation (Rmax: 80+/-4%, p<0.01), and reduced vascular superoxide formation. SB239063 treatment did not affect blood pressure and left ventricular enddiastolic pressure. In aortic tissue from CHF animals treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril, p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation was significantly reduced.",

In comparison with patients with T inversion or no significant electrocardiographic changes, patients with ST depression more often had 3-vessel coronary disease, received less acute therapy despite a strong benefit in a subgroup analysis, and had a worse clinical outcome even after adjustment in a multivariate analysis. Patients with T inversion received a high rate of acute therapy and had a better outcome than did patients without significant electrocardiographic changes and patients with ST depression.", 
    "220": "The chronic treatment of rats with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, results in hypertension. This inhibition of NO production results in activation of the renin-angiotensin system, with increased activity of the carboxypeptidase angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Since chronic NO inhibition increases ACE activity, we hypothesized that this inhibition could also affect the activities of other peptidases involved in cardiovascular functions. To test this possibility, we examined the activities of aminopeptidase M (APM), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), metalloendopeptidase 24.15 (MEP 24.15) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP 24.11) in rat brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung and thoracic aorta. Male Wistar rats were treated chronically with L-NAME (80mgkg(-1) per day) administered in the drinking water for 4 weeks and their organs then removed and processed for the determination of peptidase activities. Treatment with L-NAME did not significantly alter the activities of the four peptidases in brain, heart, kidney, liver and lung. In contrast, in aorta, the activity of APM was slightly but significantly reduced whereas those of DPP IV and MEP 24.15 were markedly enhanced; NEP 24.11 was not detected in this tissue. Immunoblotting for DPP IV and MEP 24.15 showed increased expression in aortic tissue. Neither L-NAME (1-100microM) nor the NO donors sodium nitroprusside and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1; 1-100microM) had any consistent effect on the activity of recombinant MEP 24.15 or renal DPP IV. The importance of MEP 24.15 in peptide metabolism was confirmed in pentobartibal-anesthetized rats pretreated with the MEP 24.15 inhibitor N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Aib-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (JA2), which significantly potentiated the hypotensive response to bradykinin. The altered peptidase activities seen in aorta may contribute to modulating vascular responses in this model of hypertension.", 
    "221": "Rupture of the ventricular free wall is a leading cause of death in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). There are a number of risk indicators that are associated with cardiac rupture, such as female gender, old age, hypertension, and first MI. Typical symptoms of cardiac rupture are recurrent or persistent chest pain, syncope, and distension of jugular veins. Electrocardiographic signs may include sinus tachycardia, new Q-waves in 2 or more leads, persistent or recurrent ST segment elevation, deviation of expected evolutionary T-wave pattern, and electromechanical dissociation in end-stage cases. Once patients at risk have been identified using clinical symptoms and electrocardiographic signs, a fast and sensitive diagnostic test to confirm cardiac rupture is transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). New insights in the etiology of subacute myocardial rupture suggests that defective cardiac remodeling may predispose the heart for rupture. The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system has been shown to play an important role in cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and cardiac rupture. Current therapy of cardiac rupture consists mainly of surgery, and conservative management with hemodynamic monitoring, prolonged bed rest, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in selected cases.",

Reinforcement was used as an intervention for quality improvement. All personnel of Division of Cardiology including nursing staff, medical residents, cardiology fellows, and attending physicians were reinforced to adhere to the evidence-based management.

The prevalence of particular groups of drugs administered in both genders was similar with the exception for calcium blockers, which were more frequently used in women (p<0.001), whereas long acting nitrates in men (p<0.001). In general, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long acting nitrates and cardiac glycosides use increased with age. On the contrary, beta blockers and calcium blockers were given mostly to younger patients.

    "254": "We have shown previously that a moderate reflex increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) elevated glomerular capillary pressure, whereas a more severe increase in RSNA decreased glomerular capillary pressure. This suggested that the nerves innervating the glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles could be selectively activated, allowing differential control of glomerular capillary pressure. A caveat to this conclusion was that intrarenal actions of neurally stimulated ANG II might have contributed to the increase in postglomerular resistance. This has now been investigated. Anesthetized rabbits were prepared for renal micropuncture and RSNA recording. One group (ANG II clamp) received an infusion of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalaprilat, 2 mg/kg bolus plus 2 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) plus ANG II ( approximately 20 ng.kg(-1).min(-1)), the other vehicle. Measurements were made before (room air) and during 14% O(2). Renal blood flow decreased less during ANG II clamp compared with vehicle [9 +/- 1% vs. 20 +/- 4%, interaction term (P(GT)) < 0.05], despite a similar increase in RSNA in response to 14% O(2) in the two groups. Arterial pressure and glomerular filtration rate were unaffected by 14% O(2) in both groups. Glomerular capillary pressure increased from 33 +/- 1 to 37 +/- 1 mmHg during ANG II clamp and from 33 +/- 2 to 35 +/- 1 mmHg in the vehicle group before and during 14% O(2), respectively (P(GT) < 0.05). During ANG II clamp, postglomerular vascular resistance was still increased in response to RSNA during 14% O(2), demonstrating that the action of the renal nerves on the postglomerular vasculature was independent of the renin-angiotensin system. This further supports our hypothesis that increases in RSNA can selectively control pre- and postglomerular vascular resistance and therefore glomerular ultrafiltration.",

The present study was performed to investigate the effect of sub-chronic administration of captopril on the aortic reactivity of streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Streptozotocin-diabetic rats received captopril (30 and 50 mg/kg per day) for 2 months. Contractile responses to phenylephrine (PE) and relaxation responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and isosorbide dinitrate (ISD) were obtained from aortic rings. Concentration-response curves from captopril-treated diabetic rats to PE were attenuated compared with vehicle (Saline)-treated diabetic rats, especially at a dose of 50 mg/kg captopril. In addition, endothelium-dependent relaxation responses induced by ACh were significantly higher in captopril-treated diabetic rats compared with diabetic rats. The endothelium-independent relaxation responses for ISD were found not to be significantly different among the groups. Therefore, sub-chronic treatment of diabetic rats with captopril in a dose-dependent manner could prevent the functional changes in vascular reactivity in diabetic rats.",

Previously we demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of ACEI treatment on the hypertensive proteinuric post-transplant patients (N = 10) who had been followed up for 12 months. However, not all patients show good response in urinary protein reduction. We aimed to analyse the histopathological factor(s) affecting the responsiveness of proteinuria to ACEI treatment. Fourteen post-transplant patients with proteinuria who were treated with ACEI and underwent allograft biopsy were analysed. Eight patients showed 50% or more reduction in proteinuria (responder). The other 6 patients showed less (< 50%) reduction in proteinuria (non-responder). There was no difference in clinical characteristics (BP, renal function, donor age, recipient body mass index), dietary sodium or protein intake, and diuretic use between the two groups. As a histopathological characteristic, glomerular size in responder group was significantly larger than that in non-responder group. This suggests that the large glomerular size at least partly contributes to the responsiveness in urinary protein reduction to ACEI treatment in kidney allograft recipients with proteinuria.",

The most common topics involved the use of diuretics, potassium, and ACE inhibitors, most often about how to titrate diuretics, what targets to use to optimize diuretic therapy, and how to select discharge doses of diuretics. Questions of whether to use a therapy occurred 73 times, and how to use a therapy, 242 times. RCT data were difficult to apply to these questions because little information exists about how to combine and titrate HF drugs and how to adjust diuretics. Questions about individual drugs arose in patients who fell outside the average RCT entry criteria for age, blood pressure, and creatinine.", 
    "266": "Most refractory questions focused on how to integrate and adjust therapies within the overall medical regimen and how to apply data to patients not represented in RCTs. Future studies should evaluate strategies of care for the advanced HF population.", 
    "267": "Plasma renin activity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence correlate closely in people with hypertension. The effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on blood pressure (BP) are important in hypertensive patients; accumulating data suggest that the growth effects of Ang II in the cardiovascular system play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis development in hypertensive patients requires fundamental changes in endothelial structure and function. Key among the factors that may affect the endothelium is the renin--angiotensin--bradykinin system. Ang II, independent of other environmental and neurohormonal factors, mediates the vessel wall changes critical for the development of atherosclerotic disease. A strong correlation appears to exist between Ang II and CVD. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has a major impact on arterial structure and function independent of BP. Certain angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors produce significant improvements in arterial compliance, which may yield a reduction in cardiovascular events. Blockade of the neurohormonal system may be a critical first-line approach to management of hypertension in an effort to prevent or reverse endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, the effects of ACE inhibition, in addition to its effect on BP, suggest that this therapeutic approach may be appropriate for managing patients at risk of CVD who do not yet have hypertension. The ideal antihypertensive agent should yield smooth, consistent BP control over the entire 24-hour period, both to avoid BP variability that places patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events and to offer protection during the vulnerable early morning hours when patients are well known to be at high risk.", 
    "268": "To explore the role of angiotensin II, we assessed hemodynamics and cardiac function in angiotensinogen-deficient mice in comparison to wild-type animals. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and wall thickness were evaluated by echocardiography and systolic and diastolic left ventricular function by pressure-volume relations using a micro-conductance catheter. Compared to wild-type animals, the angiotensinogen-deficient mice were hypotensive and showed impaired systolic function. The hearts were dilated, demonstrated by echocardiography and by a right-ward shift of the pressure-volume loops, but end-diastolic pressure, isovolumic relaxation (tau) and diastolic stiffness were unchanged. Afterload, however, was reduced leading to maintained cardiac output. Although a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system via angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist is beneficial after cardiac failure, the absence of angiotensin peptides during the ontogenesis leads to dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "269": "Recent data suggest that use of relatively high doses of angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk may reduce the incidence of clinical complications to a greater extent than would be predicted based on blood-pressure (BP) lowering alone. There is also evidence that a sustained reduction in BP, however small, may be important in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the ARB dosages that optimize the efficacy/tolerability ratio.", 
    "270": "This article reviews experimental and clinical studies of the ARB valsartan to define the daily dose that provides the best ratio between efficacy and tolerability in patients with hypertension, heart failure, or both.", 
    "271": "Relevant studies were identified through searches of EMBASE and Science Citation Index for articles published before December 15, 2003. No language restrictions were applied. Search terms were angiotensin II-receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "272": "In several randomized, double-blind, dose-finding studies, the antihypertensive effect of valsartan increased in a predictable fashion over a wide dose range (20-320 mg). The antihypertensive efficacy of the 80-mg dose was enhanced by doubling it to 160 mg, and the tolerability profile remained comparable to that of placebo over a broad dose range. Valsartan has been investigated in patients with heart failure at dosages ranging from 40 to 160 mg BID. Because of the need for careful individualization of therapy in these patients, rigid dose standardization may not be appropriate.", 
    "273": "Based on the efficacy/tolerability profile of valsartan at various doses, it appears that 160 mg may be the optimal dose for initial therapy in patients with essential hypertension and in most patients with heart failure.", 
    "274": "Clinical practice guidelines have become a standard way of implementing evidence-based practice, yet research has shown that clinicians do not always follow guidelines.", 
    "275": "As part of a larger study to test the effects of an intervention on provider adherence to ischaemic heart disease (IHD) guidelines, we conducted five focus groups at three Veterans Administration Medical Centers with 32 primary care providers, cardiologists, and internists to identify key barriers and facilitators to adherence of the guidelines. Using content analysis, responses were grouped into categories.", 
    "276": "The main perceived advantages of using the IHD guidelines were improvements in quality and the cost of care. Perceived barriers were the lack of ability of guidelines to manage the care of any one individual patient, the difficulty of accessing guidelines, and high workloads with many complex patients. While providers agreed on the benefits of aspirin, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, barriers for use of these medications were lack of consensus about contraindications, difficulty in providing follow-up during medication titration, and lack of patient adherence. Sources of influence for guideline use were: professional cardiology organizations, colleagues, mainly cardiologists, and key cardiology journals. However, most providers acknowledged that following guidelines was a personal practice decision.", 
    "277": "While results validated the influences of using clinical practice guidelines, our results highlight the importance of ascertaining guideline-specific barriers for building effective interventions to improve provider adherence. An advisory panel reviewed results and, using a modified nominal group process, chose implementation strategies targeting key barriers.", 
    "278": "The treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients due to its high prevalence rate belongs to the everyday clinical practice of internists, diabetologists and general practitioners. The main points of the initiation on of antihypertensive treatment in diabetic patients are reviewed. In order to decrease the target organ damages the treatment of early recognized cardiovascular risk factors are of great importance. The target value of antihypertensive treatment in diabetic patients is < 130/80 mmHg (in case of proteinuria > 1 g daily: < 125/75 mmHg). The global cardiovascular risk is high or very high in diabetic patients both with grade I-III hypertension and with high normal blood pressure, therefore, treatment with antihypertensive drug (besides life style optimalisation) should be initiated promptly in these cases. In case of micro- or macroalbuminuria antihypertensive drug (mainly with characteristics of blocking the renin-angiotensin-system) should be given to each diabetic subject irrespective of actual blood pressure values. Success of antihypertensive treatment in diabetic patients could be achieved mainly with combination therapy only. It is reasonable to initiate antihypertensive therapy primarily with a low dose combination of two agents in diabetic patients with hypertension.", 
    "279": "Nephrocalcinosis is a chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy characterized by tubular calcium phosphate deposition and slowly progressive renal insufficiency. We report a novel association of acute nephrocalcinosis and acute renal failure (ARF) with colonoscopy preceded by a bowel-cleansing regimen consisting of oral sodium phosphate solution (OSPS). A cohort of 5 patients (mean age, 69.2 years) had normal renal function (mean serum creatininem 0.9 mg/dL) before colonoscopy and presented with ARF (mean serum creatinine, 4.9 mg/dL) from 3 days to 2 months postcolonoscopy. Past medical history included hypertension in all 5 patients. Medications included an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 4 patients and diuretics in 2 patients. In all patients, colonoscopy was preceded by bowel cleansing with OSPS; OSPS was contraindicated in a single patient with hyperparathyroidism and was used at excessive doses in another. Renal biopsy specimens obtained from all 5 patients revealed diffuse tubular injury and abundant tubular deposition of calcium phosphate. Although the tubular injury involved all tubular segments, lectin and immunohistochemical staining disclosed calcium phosphate deposition confined to distal tubules and collecting ducts. At a mean of 5.8 weeks of postbiopsy follow-up, renal function was unchanged in 4 patients and mildly improved in 1 patient. We conclude that acute nephrocalcinosis is a seemingly rare complication of bowel cleansing with OSPS. The pathophysiology of acute nephrocalcinosis after treatment with OSPS likely involves transient hyperphosphatemia; volume depletion exacerbated by intercurrent ACE-I, ARB, and diuretic use; and elevated distal tubular phosphate and calcium concentrations. Greater awareness of this entity is needed to identify potential risk factors.", 
    "280": "Questions remain as to the existence of a class effect amongst angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and some literature suggests that pharmacological effects and outcomes may be determined by an ACE inhibitor's propensity to penetrate and inhibit the ACE enzyme at the vascular tissue level. Because vascular inflammation contributes to adverse outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and angiotensin II influences inflammation at the vascular level, we hypothesized that high-tissue penetrating ACE inhibitors would provide more favorable effects on C-reactive protein (CRP) after AMI compared to low-tissue penetrating ACE inhibitors.", 
    "281": "In a randomized open-label trial, patients received the high-tissue penetrating quinapril (n = 15) or low-tissue penetrating enalapril (n = 15) following AMI. C-reactive protein was measured at baseline and periodically over 14 days following drug initiation. All baseline characteristics and blood pressure response to treatment between groups were equivalent. Prior to initiating study medication, CRP concentrations (mg/g) were similar between enalapril and quinapril (0.327 +/- 0.571 versus 0.273 +/- 0.380, respectively, p = 0.77). The percent magnitude of change in CRP concentrations favored quinapril at all time points, starting 12 h after treatment initiation. When characterizing CRP production during treatments, the time courses were significantly different and demonstrated lower CRP concentrations with quinapril (p = 0.0107).", 
    "282": "Overall, this investigation into the importance of ACE inhibitor tissue penetration on a common marker of vascular inflammation, suggests a potential vascular anti-inflammatory benefit with a more highly tissue penetrating ACE inhibitor following AMI. Further investigation into the true pharmacological similarities and differences amongst this class of drugs is warranted.", 
    "283": "Numerous clinical studies have established that angiotensin II receptor blockers are effective as antihypertensive therapy and are well tolerated. Studies demonstrate that adding an angiotensin II receptor blocker to existing antihypertensive regimens reduces cardiovascular and renal risk, which may, in part, be a result of blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Though the antihypertensive dose response of these agents is well documented, the dose response for optimal target organ protection has not yet been clarified. A review of recent studies of angiotensin II receptor blockers in hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and nephropathy provide some data on specific drugs, doses, and risk reduction. Taken as a whole, these studies suggest the highest doses tested, which are at the upper limit of the antihypertensive range, provide greater risk reduction than lower doses. What is unknown is whether even higher doses or full-dose angiotensin II receptor blockers plus full-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might provide even greater risk reduction. Data from ongoing trials will provide additional insight.", 
    "284": "African-American patients with hypertension are less responsive to blockers of the renin-angiotensin system than white patients. The relative efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers and the extent of cross-resistance to these agents has not been studied. Fifty-one African-American patients with stage 1-2 hypertension were randomly assigned to enalapril or candesartan cilexetil for 8 weeks and then crossed over to the other treatment. Nonresponders to enalapril and candesartan used a combination of the two. Of the 51 patients randomized (average age 61.2+/-9 years, blood pressure 148/100 mm Hg, heart rate 74 bpm, and body weight 92.8 kg), 44 completed the study. At Week 8, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced by 4.8 mm Hg with enalapril and by 4.7 mm Hg with candesartan (p=NS), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was reduced by 4.4 mm Hg and 5.6 mm Hg, respectively (p<0.04). Of these 44 patients, 11 (25%) responded to enalapril by SBP criteria and 19 (43%) by DBP criteria. Seven patients (16%) responded by both SBP and DBP criteria, and 21 patients (48%) were nonresponders. With candesartan, 13 patients (29%) responded by SBP criteria, 20 (45%) by DBP criteria and 12 (27%) by both SBP and DBP criteria (p<0.04, compared with enalapril). Only six patients (14%) responded to both enalapril and candesartan by both SBP and DBP criteria. Of the 18 nonresponders to either enalapril or candesartan, the combination of the two had minimal additional effect. Significant changes in plasma-renin activity and angiotensin II levels were noted only with the high dose of each drug. In this small group of patients, treatment with candesartan resulted in slightly higher response and control rates than enalapril, more than 40% of patients who responded to enalapril did not respond to candesartan and vice versa, and in nonresponders, a combination of candesartan and enalapril offered little additional antihypertensive effect.",

Search terms included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, diabetic nephropathy, dual blockade, renin-angiotensin system, and combination therapy.", 
    "287": "Monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor provides incomplete blockade of the RAS. Dual blockade of the RAS has been studied in approximately 300 patients with diabetic nephropathy. Recent randomized controlled studies suggest that dual blockade using an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in diabetic nephropathy is well tolerated and will provide an additional 11-43% reduction in albuminuria versus monotherapy.", 
    "288": "Dual blockade of the RAS using an ACE inhibitor and an ARB provide statistically significant reductions in albuminuria and blood pressure. Use of dual blockade is safe, but requires additional monitoring for hyperkalemia. Long-term studies are needed to determine whether the decrease in albuminuria will correlate with an actual improvement from overt proteinuria to microalbuminuria or a decreased incidence of end-stage renal disease in the overall diabetic population.", 
    "289": "The putative circulating factor responsible for the glomerular permeability alterations induced in vitro by serum from patients affected by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) remains unidentified. We have observed that a serine proteinase isolated from patient serum increases albumin permeability in isolated glomeruli. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of various proteinase inhibitors on glomerular albumin permeability (P(alb)) in isolated glomeruli incubated with FSGS serum.", 
    "290": "The study population consisted of 12 FSGS patients (eight males; mean age: 21+/-10 years) previously shown to have elevated serum albumin permeability activity. P(alb) was determined by measuring the change in glomerular volume induced by applying oncotic gradients to isolated healthy rat glomeruli treated with patient serum in comparison to control serum. Solutions of seven different proteinase inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml) were added to the incubation media with the sera (1:1 vol/vol): serine proteinase inhibitors (PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, gabexate mesylate), the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64, the metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA and the aspartate proteinase inhibitor pepstatin. Sera from the same patients were also tested with the addition to the incubation media of quinaprilat, an inhibitor of the metalloproteinase angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "291": "Mean P(alb) of the sera was 0.86+/-0.11, with the addition of PMSF 0.41+/-0.09, leupeptin 0.30+/-0.17, aprotinin 0.09+/-0.14, gabexate mesylate 0.27+/-0.25, E-64 0.81+/-0.09, EDTA 0.68+/-0.10 or pepstatin 0.76+/-0.11. The mean P(alb) of the sera combined with quinaprilat was reduced to 0.34+/-0.35. Thus, only the serine proteinase inhibitors consistently blocked the increased P(alb) induced by the FSGS sera.", 
    "292": "In the cascade of events that lead to the initiation of glomerular fibrosis in FSGS, the putative glomerular permeability factor associated with FSGS may require a serine proteinase to effect its activity.", 
    "293": "Two neuropeptides, bombesin (BBS) and neurotensin (NT) and their radiolabeled analogues, have great potential for tumour targeting, either for diagnosis (e.g., with 99mTc) or therapy (e.g., with 90Y or 188Re). In this study, we investigated NT(8-13) and BBS(7-14) analogues with Nalpha-histidinyl acetate linked to the N-terminus of the peptide. This His-derivative forms a stable and inert tridentate complex with the 99mTc(CO)3 and the 188Re(CO)3 moieties. The stability of 99mTc-labeled neurotensin and bombesin analogues was tested in human plasma samples and in tumour cell cultures in the presence and absence of specific enzyme inhibitors. The inhibitor of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) was the most effective in inhibiting the peptide cleavage of both NT(8-13) and BBS(7-14). In agreement with this finding, the replacement of Ile12 by tert-leucine (NT) and Leu13 by cyclohexylalanin (BBS) brought about a better stability. With NT(8-13) analogues, higher tumour to nontarget (t/nt) ratios and the same affinity to the receptor was observed, but with BBS(7-14) derivatives the affinity was lower and the t/nt ratio was not significantly improved. Toxicity tests showed no effect in mice of up to a five-hundred-fold higher dose than planned for patient application, which started successfully with NT(8-13) analogues.", 
    "294": "Heart failure (HF) may complicate ischemic heart disease in both its acute and chronic manifestations, representing a prevalent health problem throughout the world. Development of therapies to improve heart function, relieve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations and improve survival is a high priority in cardiovascular medicine. The available pharmacological strategies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists have recently been complemented by new electrical therapy, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for \"MADIT II\" patients and cardiac resynchronization for the 30% of HF patients with concomitant intraventricular conduction delay. The wide variety of available HF medications provides ample evidence that we have not yet succeeded in this effort. Safe and effective inotropic electrical therapy could be a useful addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in an attempt to correct Ca2+ fluxes abnormalities during the cardiac action potential. Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) by means of non-excitatory electrical currents delivered during the action potential plateau has been shown to acutely enhance systolic function in humans with HF. Herewith, we report on our preliminary experience with CCM therapy for patients with HF, providing fundamental notions to characterize the rationale of this novel form of therapy. Briefly, CCM therapy appears to be safe and feasible. Proarrhythmic effects of this novel therapy seem unlikely. Preliminary data indicate that CCM gradually and significantly improves systolic performance, symptoms and functional status. The technique would appear to be attractive as an additive treatment for severe HF. Controlled randomized studies are needed to validate this novel concept.",

We present two cases from our hospital in order to illustrate the therapeutic consequences resulting from angioedema associated with the intake of ACEIs. Surgical airway management should be considered early if medical treatment fails.", 
    "296": "Prolonged overactivation of neurohormonal mechanisms in heart failure produces deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system and leads to poor prognosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to interrupt this excessive overactivity and improve survival. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system leads to increased synthesis of aldosterone in heart failure. Some aldosterone production is independent of ACEs; therefore, ACE inhibition does not entirely suppress the excessive formation of aldosterone. An excess of aldosterone in heart failure leads to sodium retention and myocardial fibrosis. The use of aldosterone antagonists, combined with standard therapy for heart failure, improves morbidity and mortality.", 
    "297": "Patients with heart failure face a very high risk of hospitalizations and mortality. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists reduce hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure, these life-saving therapies continue to be underutilized. A number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients with heart failure are not receiving treatment with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies when guided by conventional care. Treatment gaps in providing other components of heart failure patient care, including patient education, have also been documented. The demonstration that initiation of cardiovascular protective medications prior to hospital discharge results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, and better clinical outcomes has led to the revision of national guidelines to endorse this approach as the standard of care. Recent studies demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy can be safely and effectively initiated in heart failure patients prior to hospital discharge, resulting in improved treatment rates and clinical outcomes. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) is a national collaborative designed to improve medical care and education of hospitalized heart failure patients and to accelerate initiation of evidence-based heart failure guideline-recommended therapies by administering them before hospital discharge. A registry focusing on hospital admission to discharge and 60-90 day follow-up is designed to evaluate the demographic, pathophysiologic, clinical, treatment, and outcome characteristics of patients hospitalized with heart failure. The aim of this program is to improve the standard of heart failure care in the hospital and outpatient settings and to increase the use of evidence-based therapeutic strategies to prolong life in the large number of heart failure patients hospitalized each year.", 
    "298": "It is now well recognized that the rupture of vulnerable plaque, which consists of an atheromatous plaque core covered by a thin fibrous cap with ongoing inflammation, is a major cause of thrombus formation leading to the development of acute coronary syndrome. Several diagnostic techniques, including vascular imaging and serologic markers, are clinically available or currently under investigation for the detection of vulnerable plaque. A combination of several diagnostic modalities might allow effective screening of individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events. Plaque stabilization with pharmacologic interventions--statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors--might effectively prevent the development of acute coronary syndromes caused by plaque disruption.", 
    "299": "The Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) trials looked at the effects of candesartan in addition to best possible treatment for heart failure in 7601 patients. CHARM encompassed three studies in discrete populations, including patients with left ventricular dysfunction taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (CHARM-Added), patients with maintained left ventricular function (CHARM-Preserved), and patients with left ventricular dysfunction and an intolerance to ACE inhibitors (CHARM-Alternative). CHARM-Alternative was considered a success in that its participants experienced a significant reduction in each component of the study's primary end point, which was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, over a median follow-up of 34 months. Candesartan was by and large well tolerated in these ACE-inhibitor intolerant patients; thus, the findings of this study provide additional support for the effectiveness of angiotensin receptor blocker therapy in heart failure patients poorly tolerant of an ACE inhibitor; however, candesartan was not convincingly shown to improve the incidence/severity of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and glomerular filtration rate reductions that were the basis for ACE inhibitor intolerance in approximately 25% of the study population.", 
    "300": "Mechanisms underlying biological effects of statin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapies differ. Thus, we studied vascular responses to combination therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted with 50 hypercholesterolemic patients with simvastatin and either placebo or ramipril (study I) and in 45 hypercholesterolemic diabetic patients with simvastatin or ramipril with placebo or simvastatin combined with ramipril (study II) for 2 months with 2 months washout. In study I simvastatin combined with ramipril significantly reduced blood pressure after 2 months. Simvastatin alone or combined with ramipril significantly changed lipoproteins, improved percent flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia by 30+/-5% and 53+/-6%, respectively (P<0.001), and reduced plasma levels of malondialdehyde by 4+/-7% (P=0.026) and 25+/-4% (P<0.001), respectively. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels decreased by 3+/-3% and 12+/-2%, respectively (P=0.049 and P=0.001, respectively), C-reactive protein levels changed by 0% and 18%, respectively (P=0.036 and P<0.001, respectively), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen levels changed by -7+/-7% and 17+/-5%, respectively (P=0.828 and P<0.001, respectively). In study II ramipril alone did not significantly change lipoproteins and C-reactive protein levels, however, simvastatin combined with ramipril significantly changed lipoproteins and C-reactive protein levels more than ramipril alone (P<0.001 and P=0.048 by ANOVA, respectively). Ramipril alone or simvastatin combined with ramipril significantly improved the percent flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia (both P<0.001), however, simvastatin combined with ramipril showed significantly more improvement than ramipril alone (P<0.001 by ANOVA). Simvastatin combined with ramipril significantly improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation and fibrinolysis potential and reduced plasma levels of oxidant stress and inflammation markers in hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "301": "Regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with improved prognosis. The aim of this trial was to compare the effects of irbesartan versus atenolol on LVH in subjects with essential hypertension. Because electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters of LVH carry disparate prognostic information, both methods were applied in this trial. In the randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial CardioVascular Irbesartan Project, 240 patients with essential hypertension were treated with irbesartan or atenolol for 18 months. Voltage criteria used for LVH were Sokolow index, Cornell index, Cornell voltage x QRS duration product and Lewis index. In parallel, left ventricular mass (LVM) was determined by 2-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography. After 6 and 18 months, reductions of LVM and voltage criteria for LVH were only found in subjects treated with irbesartan. However, a reduction of LVM was only detectable in subjects within the highest quartile of baseline LVM but not overall. In contrast, reductions of voltage criteria for LVH were detectable after 6 and 18 months even within commonly used normal limits. In conclusion, treatment of hypertension with irbesartan resulted in a significant reduction in the voltage criteria for LVH, although an effect on LVM was only seen in subjects with high baseline LVM. In contrast, atenolol did not lead to reductions in electrocardiographic or echocardiographic parameters of LVH. Because voltage criteria for LVH have been shown to predict cardiovascular outcome independently from LVM, we suggest that both methods should be used to accurately assess the benefits of antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "302": "In this study, endogenous as well as synthetic reducing systems were shown to reduce the disulphide bonds formed in glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an important glycolytic enzyme previously reported to have lost its activity in human cataract lenses, resulting in reviving the activity of this enzyme. Disulphide bond formation is a non-specific posttranslational modification of proteins, which leads to a loss of function of the affected protein. When an enzyme is targeted, this harmful effect can be easily detected by monitoring the change of activity. Endogenous reducing systems are responsible for breaking these bonds and returning the protein (enzyme) to its natural state, when these mechanisms fail to do so, the loss of enzyme activity will be permanent.", 
    "303": "Pathological changes in glomerular structure are typically associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The involvement of angiotensin II (AII) in pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy has been extensively studied and the therapeutic advantages associated with blockade of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), primarily with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, has been well-documented. We studied the effect of RAS blockade with an AII receptor antagonist (losartan) vs. an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) on glomerular lesions in KKAy mice, a model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Losartan was administered at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day and enalapril at 3 mg/kg/day for 14 weeks in the drinking water. The doses of losartan at 10 mg/kg/day was expected to be equivalent to 3 mg/kg/day of enalapril when considering clinical doses for lowering blood pressure. The dose of 3 mg/kg/day of losartan was selected to compare the efficacy at equivalent dose of enalapril. Histologic observation demonstrated suppression of glomerular mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis with exudative lesion in the 10 mg/kg/day losartan group when compared to the untreated diabetic controls. A lesser degree of glomerulosclerosis was also observed with losartan and enalapril treatment at 3 mg/kg/day. Ultrastructural examination of renal glomeruli from the high dose losartan group revealed a decreased degree of effacement and/or irregular arrangement of glomerular podocytic foot process. The beneficial effect of RAS inhibition with the AII receptor antagonist losartan on diabetic glomerular lesions was clearly demonstrated in this study. These findings, therefore, provide mechanistic explanation for the clinical utility of losartan for use in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in man.",

    "318": "Achieving target glycaemic goals while avoiding hypoglycaemia is a major challenge in the management of elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. Repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia may cause extreme emotional distress in such patients, even when the episodes are relatively mild. Moreover, evidence is mounting that hypoglycaemia among elderly patients is a very real and costly health concern. The strongest predictors of severe hypoglycaemia in the elderly are advanced age, recent hospitalisation and polypharmacy. Education is the key to preventing recurrent or severe hypoglycaemia. As such, there should be close coordination of care between the patient, physician and all other healthcare providers in identifying the cause of hypoglycaemia in elderly patients, and appropriate steps should be taken to prevent further episodes. Prevention of hypoglycaemia has the potential to improve psychosocial aspects of elderly health, including enhanced quality of life, boosted confidence, improved compliance with antidiabetic regimens and avoidance of long-term complications. Since the elderly population represents a unique group, it is imperative to focus on the aetiologies that are exclusive to this group. Advanced age itself is a risk factor for hypoglycaemia, and elderly patients with comorbidities are at increased risk when they are hospitalised. Elderly patients with diabetes often have compromised renal function, which intereferes with drug elimination and thus predisposes them to prolonged life-threatening hypoglycaemia. In addition, patients on five or more prescription medications are prone to drug-associated hypoglycaemia. Although sulfonylurea-associated hypoglycaemia is common, drugs such as ACE inhibitors and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists can also predispose patients to hypoglycaemia. Greater attention should be paid to the avoidance of hypgolycaemia in nursing home residents. Recurrent hypoglycaemia in elderly patients is not only detrimental to achieving good glycaemic control, it is also a substantial economic burden. Once the causes of hypoglycaemia have been identified, it is crucial to formulate and institute a prevention plan. Firstly, global evaluation of the patient should be carried out to identify possible predisposing risk factors. Secondly, target glycaemic goals should be tailored to each patient. Thirdly, selection of antidiabetic agents should be judicious, then patients and family should be educated to recognise and treat hypoglycaemia. Finally, coordinated care should be provided to identify, treat and prevent hypoglycaemia.",

Many of these strategies test approaches that may directly target the vessel wall. Therapeutic modalities currently being evaluated include thiazolidinediones, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers.

    "341": "Low dietary sodium (LS) increases the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in patients and experimental models, but mechanisms underlying this enhanced efficacy are largely unknown. Because the benefits of ACE inhibition are mediated to a considerable extent by their effect on the vasculature, we studied whether low sodium alters the vascular effects of ACE inhibition. Baseline functional and morphological characteristics, and endothelium-dependent and -independent dilatory responses were studied in isolated perfused small intrarenal and mesenteric arteries obtained from control rats (CON), rats on LS, lisinopril-treated rats (CON-LIS), or rats treated with lisinopril during LS (LS-LIS). We found, first, that LS-LIS compared with CON-LIS enhances blood pressure reduction. Second, interlobar renal arteries had increased lumen diameter and reduced adrenergic contractility in CON-LIS compared with CON, without additional effects of LS. In contrast, mesenteric arteries were not altered in CON-LIS compared with CON, but became triggered for increased myogenic and adrenergic constriction in LS-LIS. Third, LS-LIS decreased acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasodilation in both mesenteric and renal arteries compared with CON-LIS. During the latter condition, opposite prostaglandins are involved in the endothelial function of the two different vascular beds, i.e., increased involvement of contractile prostaglandins in ACh-induced vasodilatation in renal arteries, versus dilatory prostaglandins in mesenteric arteries. Whether cause or consequence of the enhanced blood pressure response, our data demonstrate a modifying effect of dietary sodium on vascular effects of ACE inhibition. These findings provide a rationale for further studies addressing the mechanism-of-actions of our therapies to find additional strategies to improve therapy response.", 
    "342": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metallopeptidase that plays a major role in blood homoeostasis and reproduction in mammals. In vertebrates, both transmembrane and soluble ACE, containing one or two homologous active sites, have been characterized. So far, several ACEs from invertebrates have been cloned, but only in insects. They are soluble and display a single active site. Using biochemical procedures, an ACE-like activity was detected in our model, the leech, Theromyzon tessulatum. Annelida is the most distant phylum in which an ACE activity has been observed. To gain more insight into the leech enzyme, we have developed a PCR approach to characterize its mRNA. The approx. 2 kb cDNA has been predicted to encode a 616-amino-acid soluble enzyme containing a single active site, named TtACE (T. tessulatum ACE). Surprisingly, its primary sequence shows greater similarity to vertebrates than to invertebrates. Stable in vitro expression of TtACE in transfected Chinese-hamster ovary cells revealed that the leech enzyme is a functional metalloprotease. As in mammals, this 79 kDa glycosylated enzyme functions as a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase capable of hydrolysing angiotensin I to angiotensin II. However, a weak chloride inhibitory effect and acetylated N-acetyl-SDKP (Ac SDAcKP) hydrolysis reveal that TtACE activity resembles that of the N-domain of mammalian ACE. In situ hybridization shows that its cellular distribution is restricted to epithelial midgut cells. Although the precise roles and endogenous substrates of TtACE remain to be identified, characterization of this ancestral peptidase will help to clarify its physiological roles in non-insect invertebrate species.", 
    "343": "The blood pressure (BP) response to any single antihypertensive drug is characterized by marked interindividual variation, and the known predictors of response are of limited value in identifying the optimum drug for an individual patient. Analysis of genetic variation has the potential to improve our understanding of determinants of antihypertensive drug response in order to individualize drug selection. Genetic variation can influence both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms underlying variation in drug response. Classic pharmacogenetic investigations have identified variations in single genes that have a large effect on antihypertensive drug metabolism and are inherited in a Mendelian fashion. These include a polymorphism in the CYP2D6 gene, encoding a cytochrome p450 family member involved in phase I drug metabolism, and polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in phase II drug metabolism, including N-acetyltransferase (NAT2), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and phenol sulfotransferase (P-PST, SULT1A1). Although these polymorphisms have major effects on the pharmacokinetic profiles of both commonly used antihypertensive drugs such as metoprolol (CYP2D6), and lesser used drugs such as hydralazine (NAT2), methyldopa (COMT), and minoxidil (SULT1A1), they have not been shown to influence variation in the antihypertensive effect of these drugs at conventional doses. Interest is now focused on identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the pharmacodynamic determinants of antihypertensive response. Using a candidate gene approach, such polymorphisms have been identified in genes encoding alpha-adducin (ADD1), subunits of G-proteins (GNB3 and GNAS1), the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensinogen [AGT], angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE], the angiotensin type I receptor [AGTR1], and aldosterone synthase [CYP11B2]). These polymorphisms have been shown to influence the BP response to diuretics (ADD1, GNB3, NOS3, and ACE), beta-blockers (GNAS1 and ADRB1), ACE inhibitors (AGT, ACE, and AGTR1), angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE and CYP11B2), and clonidine (GNB3).An emerging consensus from these studies is that single gene effects on antihypertensive drug responses are small, and even the combined effects of all presently known polymorphisms do not account for enough variation in response to be clinically useful. New genome-wide scanning techniques may lead to the identification of genes previously unsuspected of influencing drug response. Additional requirements for pharmacogenetic approaches to become clinically useful are the characterization of the effects of haplotypes and multi-locus genotypes on drug response, and consideration of gene-by-environment interactions. Such studies will require huge sample sizes and novel statistical methods, but the theoretical and technical framework is in place to make this possible.",

    "348": "Obesity, currently affecting >20% of the adult population in most Western countries, is a major risk factor for the development of hypertension. Hypertension in obese patients is, in the majority of instances, further complicated by the concomitant presence of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. The latter is reflected by derangement of glucose homeostasis, ranging from hyperinsulinemia to frank type 2 diabetes. Hypertension in obese patients is also associated with an increased risk for left ventricular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, renal hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria, and elevated markers of inflammation. Sodium retention, volume expansion, and increased cardiac output are common findings in obese individuals. These changes are largely attributable to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and insufficient suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. Recent data show increased expression of angiotensin II-forming enzymes in adipose tissue, and increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system has recently been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Accordingly, antihypertensive agents that block the renin-angiotensin system might be a beneficial strategy for treatment of obesity-related hypertension. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers have been associated with favorable metabolic properties and end-organ protection in addition to their antihypertensive effects. Data from ongoing large trials will provide an indication of the protective and preventive effects of these treatment strategies while offering insights into the mechanisms linking obesity, hypertension, and other facets of the metabolic syndrome.",

    "361": "In placebo-treated MI rats, six weeks after MI, left ventricular circumference, inner diameter, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were increased, whereas mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dp/dt(max)) were decreased compared with sham-operated controls (P<0.01). In ramipril-treated MI rats, heart weight, heart weight to body weight ratio and interstitial collagen content were reduced (P<0.05, P<0.01), LVEDP was slightly decreased (P>0.05), and dp/dt(max) was improved (P<0.01) compared with placebo-treated MI rats. In contrast, in mibefradil-treated MI rats, heart weight, heart weight to body weight ratio were slightly but not significantly reduced, LVEDP was slightly elevated compared with placebo-treated MI rats, and was elevated (P<0.05) compared with ramipril-treated MI rats, although interstitial collagen content were reduced (P<0.01) compared with placebo-treated MI rats.",

    "363": "Extract: By the end of the 20th century the worldwide diabetes pandemic had affected an estimated 171 million individuals. Unfortunately, the future looks even worse. By 2030, approximately 366 million people will have diabetes. This disease accounts for an extraordinary amount of human suffering, it is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, and cardiovascular disease, and its complications substantially reduce both the quality and length of life. In addition, diabetes imposes staggering economic costs while lowering productivity and wasting social capital. Fortunately, several efficacious treatments are currently available to reduce or prevent diabetes-related health problems. Blood sugar and blood pressure control can reduce microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) complications; eye examinations with timely follow-up and photocoagulation can prevent vision loss; foot care can decrease serious foot disease and amputations; control of blood pressure and lipids as well as aspirin use can prevent or diminish cardiovascular disease events; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reduce nephropathy and cardiovascular disease; and influenza and pneumococcal vaccines can reduce hospitalizations, respiratory conditions, and death.",

    "366": "Hypertension was common, and its control was poor. For example, at 1 year, only 55.5% had a BP less than 140 mm Hg. Control improved only slightly in 1993-2002 compared to 1976-2002, even as patients administered 2 or more antihypertensive medications at 1 year increased from 43.5% to 54.6%. Independent correlates of higher BP included male sex, age, donor age, diabetes, body mass index, the presence of native kidneys, and delayed graft function. Previous acute rejection was associated with higher BP at virtually all times after transplantation, and these associations were independent of estimated creatinine clearance (C(Cr)). Conversely, an association between BP and subsequent acute rejection was not statistically significant when differences in C(Cr) were taken into account. After adjusting for the effects of acute rejection, C(Cr), and other variables, each 10 mm Hg of systolic BP was associated with an increased relative risk for graft failure (1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.15; P < 0.0001), death-censored graft failure (1.17; 1.12 to 1.22; P < 0.0001), and death (1.18; 1.12 to 1.23; P < 0.0001).",

    "369": "We compared early postoperative graft function between 260 cadaveric kidney transplant recipients, either with or without peritransplantation ACE inhibitor/ATII blocker therapy. Regression analysis was used to show the influence of variables interfering with posttransplantation serum creatinine levels. The effect of different variables on the occurrence of delayed graft function (DGF) was analyzed by means of stepwise logistic regression. Improvement in kidney function during the first week after transplantation was compared between groups by means of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.", 
    "370": "Intake of an ACE inhibitor or ATII blocker did not influence immediate posttransplantation graft function or the occurrence of DGF. Conversely, serum creatinine levels decreased significantly faster in patients administered an ACE inhibitor/ATII blocker than in those without therapy (P < 0.01). The only variables delaying graft function were number of previous transplantations, cold ischemia time, and male sex. Among patients with DGF, those with ACE inhibitor/ATII blocker therapy had significantly faster graft recovery (P < 0.001).", 
    "371": "Our results suggest that intake of an ACE inhibitor or ATII blocker during the immediate posttransplantation course is safe and does not impair graft function. Additionally, patients with DGF might profit from blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which possibly shortens the time to graft recovery.", 
    "372": "Fifteen adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (one year old) (SHR) were separated into three groups (n=5 each) during 15 weeks as follows: initial control group (IC); final control group (FC); and telmisartan group (T) (1.2 mg/kg/day of telmisartan). Serum and urinary creatinine and proteinuria were not different comparing untreated and telmisartan-treated SHRs. FC rats showed a continuous BP increase during the study while T rats reached the 15th week with a significantly low BP. The LV mass index was significantly smaller in the T group than in the FC group, as was the glomerular hypertrophy. The cardiomyocyte nuclei density per area and the cardiomyocyte mean cross-sectional area were smaller in the T group than in both the IC and FC groups. Intramyocardial artery densities (per area and per volume) were greater in the T group than in untreated SHRs, but myocardial fibrosis was reduced. In conclusion, telmisartan monotherapy effects on BP and also on the hypertension target organs, heart and kidney, are favorable. Telmisartan is able to attenuate SHR cardiomyocyte and glomerular hypertrophies, and myocardial reactive fibrosis as well. It also is favorable to the intramyocardial microcirculation.", 
    "373": "Data from the Framingham and several other studies have demonstrated a relatively consistent increase of systolic blood pressure over lifetime but a decrease of diastolic blood pressure after the age of 50-60 years-resulting in an increase of pulse pressure (PP). Epidemiologic studies in the past 10-15 years have stressed the importance of PP as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.A wide clinic PP (60-65 mmHg) has been shown to be a marker of increased arterial stiffness and an elevated cardiovascular morbidity. PP is determined by combined hemodynamic cardiac (ventricular ejection) and arterial factors, like arterial stiffness as well as the timing and intensity of wave reflections. Recent careful measurements have suggested that PP is transmitted much deeper into the microcirculation, which is strongly influenced by aging, hypertension, diabetes, and renal insufficiency (endothelial dysfunction, eutrophic and hypertrophic remodeling, progressive loss of microvessels). Antihypertensive drugs may improve vascular compliance and the alterations of microvascular architecture by reducing blood pressure, relaxing vascular smooth muscle, or promoting long-term effects on extracellular matrix, collagen, vascular smooth muscle, and cardiomyocyte growth and remodeling.Diuretics, beta blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin I (AT(1)) receptor antagonists were critically discussed in relation to their influence on vascular compliance, endothelial dysfunction, the remodeling process, PP, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The vascular protective action of some (especially AT(1) antagonists, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers) but not all (beta blockers) may contribute to improve the outcome of hypertensive patients, although this is presently unproven.", 
    "374": "While ACE-inhibitors have proven their prognostic benefit in many hypertension studies, a new approach has been proposed by inhibiting neutral endopeptidase, which degrades natriuretic peptides. The combined inhibition of ACE and endopeptidase was named \"vasopeptidase-inhibition\" and tested in several trial. Though effective in lowering blood pressure, a superiority to ACE-inhibitors alone could not be shown. A potentially serious side effect was the increased incidence of angioneurotic edema, which led to a complete stop in the development of this pharmaceutical strategy.", 
    "375": "Besides type 2 diabetes and cigarette smoking arterial hypertension represents the most powerful risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Independent from the existence of coronary artery disease i. e. coronary macroangiopathy arterial hypertension leads to hypertension-specific organ manifestations such as left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary microangiopathy. In the presence of coronary artery disease left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary microangiopathy aggravate the ischemic predisposition of the myocardium. Thus vascular protection measures should represent an important component of antihypertensive treatment. Due to the present state of the art based upon randomized clinical studies ACE-inhibitors are first-line antihypertensive substances due to their vascular and myocardial protective effects and their few side effects. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are not more effective than ACE-inhibitors in treatment arterial hypertension so far. Calcium channel blockers who do not stimulate the sympathetic system such as slow release verapamil and amlodipin, beta receptor blockers and diuretics are combination partners, if blood pressure cannot be normalized by treatment with ACE-inhibitors only. Since statins reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients even with not elevated LDL cholesterol levels, statins represent an important component of antihypertensive treatment. An antihypertenive treatment aiming at reducing blood pressure only is no more sufficient due to the present state of the art.", 
    "376": "Blood pressure, together with proteinuria, represents one of the most important factors in the progression of chronic renal failure (CRF). Antihypertensive therapy is beneficial to slow down the progression of a variety of chronic renal diseases, no matter what the cause. Intraglomerular hypertension, increased glomerular permeability and proteinuria should be identified, since they can be treated to prevent or minimize further glomerular injury. But not all antihypertensive drugs are equally effective to prevent the progression of CRF. Recent large trials indicate that blood pressure lowering obtained by intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has an additive renoprotective effect in diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases. In nondiabetic patients, the AIPRI and REIN studies support that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a long-term renoprotective effect. The benefits of ACE inhibitors can be demonstrated even in patients who are not hypertensive. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are shown to be renoprotective in type 2 diabetics (RENAAL and IDNT). However, whether these renoprotective effects are due to blood pressure reduction or due to the specific pharmacologic RAAS blockade is still a matter of debate. This discussion is still open, because the reduction in blood pressure levels was lower in patients treated with a drug that interferes with the RAAS compared with other antihypertensive regimens. It is concluded that both ACE inhibitors and AT II receptor antagonists are lowering the intraglomerular pressure independent of any change in systemic blood pressure by dilatation of the efferent arteriole of the glomerulus. These additional nonpressure-related effects may protect renal function by their antiproteinuric effect. In addition, beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors are related to reduction of AT II, which has potent proinflammatory effects independent of its hemodynamic influences. Other drugs, such as diuretics, beta blockers, and hydralazine, do not induce efferent dilatation and, therefore, may be less likely to reverse intraglomerular hypertension. For example, hydralazine and nifedipine appear to produce prominent afferent or preglomerular arteriolar dilatation. This will allow more of the systemic pressure to be transmitted to the glomerulus. Therefore, short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) are not recommended. By comparison, long-acting dihydropyridines such as diltiazem and verapamil are less potent vasodilators and may primarily decrease the resistance of the efferent arteriole, similar to the ACE inhibitors. They may have an antiproteinuric activity. Yet, there is lack of large prospective randomized trials.A beta blocker as antihypertensive agent is indicated as second- or third-line drug especially in patients with additional cardiovascular disease. Other antihypertensive drugs can be added as necessary to achieve the treatment goals for arterial hypertension. The use of a diuretic will often be helpful in patients who already have renal insufficiency, since fluid overload is an important cause of hypertension and may also enhance the effectiveness of drugs that interfere with the RAAS. alpha(1)-receptor or sympathetic blockers are further possible drugs for combination antihypertensive therapy.",

The mean levels of plasma sDR5 in perindopril group were (31.23+/-10.16 ) ng/L and (8.50+/-2.14) ng/L; the levels in conventional group (48.81+/-8.74) ng/L and (26.64+/-6.27) ng/L, respectively, the perindopril group was lower than the conventional group descending rates were 72.7% and 45.3% respectively.(3)The level of plasma sDR5 in CHF patients resulting from hypertensive cardiopathy was much higher than that in CHF patients resulting from any other etiological factors.", 
    "411": "DR5 may play an important role in the occurrence and progress of myocardium apoptosis of CHF patients. Perindopril can down-regulate the level of plasma sDR5, therefore, it may have the great effect on retarding course of ventricular remodeling, protecting and improving cardial function of CHF patients.", 
    "412": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) prescribed for cardiovascular and renal disease since 1980 are widely atoxic and several experimental studies and one epidemiological study have demonstrated an effect of ACEi on cancer. ACEi has the effect of modifying gene expression; inhibiting proliferation and invasion of cancer cells; reducing endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro, whereas tumour growth and metastasis were inhibited in vivo. Several mechanisms of action are possible but inhibition of matrix metalloprotease activity, reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and interference with the renin-angiotensin system were demonstrated by the experimental studies. In this paper we review the laboratory investigations and epidemiological studies on the anti-cancer actions of ACEi and present a summary of the evidence regarding the potential use of ACEi in cancer treatment.", 
    "413": "Hemodilution and increase in capillary permeability occurring with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) impose a risk for tissue edema and blood transfusion that may result in an increased complication rate after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Of the 1280 consecutive patients undergoing isolated on-pump CABG, total fluid balance at the end of the operation was less than or equal to 500 mL in 1155 (Group 1) and more than 500 mL in 125 (Group 2). During CPB, blood was added to the reservoir only when the hematocrit fell to 17% or less and crystalloid solution only when the pump flow index fell below 2.0 L/min/m2. Anesthetic, surgical, and postoperative management and diagnoses were the same in all patients, and a single surgical and anesthesia team performed all operations. No patient was excluded from the study.", 
    "414": "Hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, chronic renal failure, and female gender were the significant preoperative risk factors for increased volume replacement during CPB. The groups were similar in body mass index, preoperative hematocrit values, total fluid balance in the intensive care unit (ICU), and total chest tube output. However, red blood cells' transfusion rate, readmission rate to the ICU and length of hospital stay were significantly higher in Group 2 patients. Multiple logistic regression revealed that age > 70 years (p < 0.001, Odds Ratio (OR): 2, 95% CI: 1.4-2.8), and total fluid balance > 500 mL at the end of the operation (p < 0.01, OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.5-3.2) were the predictors of increased length of stay. For transfusion of red blood cells, age > 70 years (p < 0.0001, OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.6-3.3), and total fluid balance > 500 mL at the end of the operation (p < 0.001, OR: 2, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9) were the only significant risk factors. This study suggests that intraoperative volume overload increases blood transfusion and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing CABG.", 
    "415": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality across the continuum of vascular disease. The utilization of these agents, however, remains suboptimal. The drugs are not prescribed in many patients because of concerns regarding their effects on renal function. Despite overwhelming evidence in favor of renoprotection, it is not uncommon for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to decrease shortly after starting treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. This response is functional in nature and should be expected based on renal physiology and its dependence on the renin-angiotensin system to maintain GFR. Unfortunately, this phenomenon sometimes is viewed as an adverse effect or an indicator of underlying pathology. Although somewhat counterintuitive, early elevations in serum creatinine concentration are associated with improved long-term renal outcomes in patients with renal insufficiency and thus support, rather than condemn, continued treatment. Clinicians should be aware of the physiologic course associated with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system so that these agents will not be withheld unnecessarily.", 
    "416": "Marimastat, low molecular weight heparins and captopril have antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in animal models. We studied the safety and efficacy of the combination of these drugs in patients with advanced cancer. In all, 50 patients were enrolled. Captopril was given orally at a dose of 50 mg bd daily. Fragmin was administered as a daily subcutaneous injection of 200 units kg(-1) for the first 28 days and 5000 units thereafter. Marimastat was given at 10 mg bd orally. Serum, plasma and urinary angiogenic factors were measured at baseline and after 1 month of treatment. Inhibition of release of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) from peripheral lymphocytes was used as a surrogate pharmacodynamic end point. There was one case of haemorrhagic stroke and one upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The commonest toxicity was myalgia. One of 10 patients with renal cancer had a partial response, and three patients had a prolonged period of stable disease. The treatment significantly inhibited phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated TNF-alpha release from patient's lymphocytes. The combination of marimastat, fragmin and captopril is well tolerated and has in vivo activity. Inhibition of PHA-stimulated TNF-alpha release from lymphocytes is a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker of metalloprotease inhibition.", 
    "417": "Bradykinin is an important endogenous trigger of myocardial ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Through simultaneous inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme, omapatrilat prevents enzymatic degradation of bradykinin. The aim of this study was to investigate if omapatrilat, through its ability to augment bradykinin levels, can augment a subthreshold IPC stimulus (Sub-IPC) and to compare the action of omapatrilat with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Langendorff perfused rat hearts were subjected to 35 min left coronary artery occlusion and 120 min reperfusion. Full IPC was induced with 5 min global ischemia/10 min reperfusion and substantially limited infarct size (21.5 +/- 3.5% of risk zone vs 53.4 +/- 2.0% in controls, P < 0.01). Sub-IPC (2 min global ischemia/10 min reperfusion) did not limit infarct size (48.4 +/- 3.8%). Omapatrilat (10 micromol/L) or captopril (200 micromol/L) were administered alone or in conjunction with Sub-IPC. Reduced infarct size comparable to that observed with the full IPC protocol was seen when sub-IPC was combined with either omapatrilat (19.7 +/- 2.5%) or captopril (20.3 +/- 4.9%). Omapatrilat alone caused modest reduction of infarct size (34.6 +/- 1.5%, P < 0.01 v control), an effect not observed with captopril. Hoe140, a selective kinin B(2) receptor antagonist, eliminated the cardioprotective effect of omaptrilat alone or in combination with sub-IPC. We conclude that omapatrilat elicits cardioprotection via inhibition of bradykinin degradation and that dual inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase may have beneficial effects beyond standard angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes who are at risk of myocardial infarction.", 
    "418": "The cardioprotective properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, quinapril and enalapril were studied in a rat model of heart failure. Seventy-five rats were divided into five groups and administered quinapril or enalapril at 2 and 20 mg/kg/day (groups Q2, Q20, E2 and E20) or vehicle alone (group V, all groups n = 15). Although both ACE inhibitors improved survival rate and ventricular function in a dose-dependent manner, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and expression level of transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA were the lowest in group Q20. These results suggest that quinapril may confer greater protection than enalapril against injury from the renin-angiotensin system in heart failure.",

It slows the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) by inhibition of the activity of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and by interference with lipoprotein binding to cell-surface receptors. Elevated plasma LpB:C-III is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We studied the effect of atorvastatin on plasma LpB:C-III and HDL apoC-III.",

Plasma apoC-III was strongly correlated with plasma triglycerides (r = 0.74, P < 0.001). Atorvastatin 10- and 80-mg treatment significantly decreased plasma apoC-III (atorvastatin 10 mg, 21%, and 80 mg, 27%), HDL apoC-III (atorvastatin 10 mg, 22%, and 80 mg, 28%) and LpB:C-III (atorvastatin 10 mg, 23%, and 80 mg, 28%; all P < 0.001). The decrease in plasma apoC-III, mainly in LpB:C-III, strongly correlated with a decrease in triglycerides (atorvastatin 10 mg, r = 0.70, and 80 mg, r = 0.78; P < 0.001). Atorvastatin treatment also leads to a reduction in the HDL apoC-III-to-HDL cholesterol and HDL apoC-III-to-apoA-I ratios, indicating a change in the number of apoC-III per HDL particle (atorvastatin 10 mg, -21%, and 80 mg, -31%; P < 0.001).", 
    "422": "Atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in plasma apoC-III, HDL apoC-III, and LpB:C-III levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. These data indicate a potentially important antiatherogenic effect of statin treatment and may explain (part of) the triglyceride-lowering effect of atorvastatin.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between ACE inhibitor use and mortality in patients with diabetes and no cardiovascular disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Using the Saskatchewan health databases, 12,272 new users of oral hypoglycemic agents were identified between the years of 1991 and 1996. We excluded 3,202 subjects with previous cardiovascular disease. Of the remaining subjects, 1,187 \"new users\" of ACE inhibitors were identified (ACE inhibitor cohort). Subjects not receiving ACE inhibitor therapy throughout the follow-up period served as the control cohort (n = 4,989). Subjects were prospectively followed until death or the end of 1999.

LEMM was comparable in users of ACE inhibitors and no drug users. A trend toward larger LEMM was also observed in sex- and ethnicity-stratified analyses and in the subgroup of noncoronary hypertensive participants.",

If confirmed in longitudinal studies, this pharmacological action might have important implications for the prevention of physical disability in older patients with hypertension.", 
    "433": "TNF-alpha is a cytokine that may play a role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. In patients with heart failure, increased levels of TNF-alpha were observed that were high enough to reduce cardiac contractility in vitro. The mortality of heart failure patients increases with higher levels of TNF-alpha. For these reasons, inhibition of TNF-alpha appears to be a valid target for the improvement of heart failure therapy beyond the current practice of inhibiting neurohormonal activation with beta-blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and aldosterone antagonism. However, whilst this strategy (using soluble TNF receptor or TNF antibodies) was successful in smaller short-term studies, larger longer-term studies have not revealed any beneficial effect of this therapy (RENAISSANCE, RECOVER, RENEWAL, ATTACH). In contrast, the mortality tended to be higher in the treated groups giving rise to questions about the overall strategy. The reasons for this failure of the clinical studies to show a longer-term benefit from TNF-alpha inhibitors are unclear, but they may include an error of the general concept, individual adverse effects of the agents used for the studies, incorrect dosage and the fact that the current therapy of heart failure with beta-blockade, ACE inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists cannot be further improved by additional blockade of neurohormones or cytokines.",

    "435": "In addition to prevention, the goals of heart failure therapy are to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, slow progression of heart failure through both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, minimize or prevent acute exacerbations, reduce hospitalizations, improve survival, favorably influence neurohormones, and reduce costs. Symptoms are alleviated with diuretics and digoxin; if digoxin is used, the target therapeutic range appears to be 0.4-0.8 ng/mL. Large, well-controlled clinical trials have documented the effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blocking agents in reducing the mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure ranging from post myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction to severe heart failure. Recent large studies have documented the effectiveness of aldosterone receptor antagonists in improving mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure. There was a 30% reduction in mortality in patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure when spironolactone compared with placebo was added to a regimen consisting of digoxin, furosemide, and an ACE inhibitor. A later study in which a gamma-blocker was also included in the regimen showed that patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction with symptoms of mild heart failure following myocardial infarction taking eplerenone had a 15% relative reduction in all-cause mortality and a 21% reduction in sudden cardiac death compared with placebo. The incidence of gynecomastia was 9% and 0.5% for spironolactone and eplerenone, respectively.", 
    "436": "The data support adding aldosterone receptor antagonists alongside ACE inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blocking agents as ways to reduce mortality and morbidity in the treatment algorithm for heart failure. More research is needed to determine the usefulness of aldosterone receptor antagonists across the entire spectrum of heart failure.",

    "438": "Events preceding myocardial infarction and heart failure are driven in part by norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone. The sympathetic nervous system likely evolved to mediate acute regulation of the cardiovascular system, not the sustained activation that is seen in heart failure. Overexpression of beta1-receptors in animal models results in decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and ventricular remodeling. In patients with systolic dysfunction, beta-blockade has improved left ventricular function and decreased the risk of sudden death. Chronic exposure to excess angiotensin II produces eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, vasoconstriction, and sodium retention. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition causes only a transient depression of aldosterone concentrations; the chronic benefit from ACE inhibition in patients with heart failure likely results from augmentation of bradykinin and not from the inhibition of angiotensin II production. Administration of eplerenone, a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, following induction of ischemic injury in animals, blocked the progressive ventricular dilatation and reduction in systolic function observed in control animals; clinical studies indicate that those findings can be translated to human cardiovascular disease. Overactivity of the mineralocorticoid receptor in cardiomyocytes could be important even in the absence of excessive levels of aldosterone. Clinical studies demonstrated that strategies of neurohormonal blockade using an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and beta-blocker are ineffective in reducing circulating aldosterone in patients with heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",

The main changes with regard to the former edition are: The threshold values for the diagnosis 'hypertension' have been lowered to 140 mmHg and 90 mmHg for the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. Annual screening for hypertension in the elderly is no longer recommended. Henceforth, blood pressure measurement once every five years is considered sufficient, unless the blood pressure is known to be in a borderline area in which treatment is being considered. Often, the decision as to whether a patient should take antihypertensive drugs no longer depends on the presence of hypertension as such: to receive drug treatment, the patient should have at least a 20% risk of developing a cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years. To aid in estimating this risk for individual patients a risk table has been devised. Diuretics and beta-blockers are the drugs of first choice. If the blood pressure remains too high, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers may be added.",

Finding people with hypertension is a major goal for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. A systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg (> 160 mmHg in patients > 60 years) necessitates non-pharmaceutical advice and antihypertensive therapy with diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium antagonists, either as monotherapy or in combination.

Active surveillance is, therefore, essential because the early recognition of renal involvement may influence the extent of renal recovery. Blood pressure control is also essential, regardless of the underlying disease. In systemic lupus erythematosus, therapy usually depends on the renal biopsy findings as not all forms of renal involvement respond in the same way. Typically, for aggressive disease, therapy is with steroids and a cytotoxic agent, usually cyclophosphamide initially and then azathioprine. In systemic vasculitis with renal involvement, a similar approach is adopted, therapy including steroids and cyclophosphamide initially and then steroids and azathioprine. With severe fulminant disease, plasma exchange or pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone is added initially.

There have been recent and substantial changes in disease classification, the appreciation of its natural history and the investigation and treatment of organ-based complications. Although scleroderma still has a high case-specific mortality, there have been major improvements in the management of renal and pulmonary disease, and areas such as gastrointestinal tract involvement can also often be improved. Each of these areas is reviewed, and progress in understanding pathogenesis also described. The management of organ-based complications has benefited from advances in other branches of medicine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for scleroderma renal crisis, proton pump inhibitors for reflux oesophagitis and advanced therapies for classes III and IV pulmonary arterial hypertension exemplify progress in the treatment of systemic sclerosis. There is also the prospect of targeted, cytokine-directed treatments that may for the first time offer the prospect of genuine disease-modifying intervention in early-stage disease. In parallel with these developments, there has been substantial progress in disease assessment with the construction and initial validation of tools to assess skin biomechanics, functional impairment and the severity and activity of systemic sclerosis.

In patients carrying allele D, fructosamine levels were significantly higher (p = 0.007) than in carriers of allele I. Patients with II + ID genotypes and those who were treated with insulin took more antihypertensive drugs than the ones with II genotype or orally treated (p = 0.015). They found a significant association between genotype and fructosamine level (p = 0.023). Association between genotype or modality of treatment of diabetes (oral vs, insulin) and combined treatment of hypertension (number of antihypertensive drugs) was of borderline significance. They found that fructosamin level of patients receiving ACE inhibitor was lower than that of patients not receiving ACE inhibitors. In patients with allele D, they have also found higher activity of gamma-GT and higher albuminuria. From this results and data of the literature the authors conclude that because of insulin resistance (in connection with the presence of allele D), these patients tend to have a worse metabolic state, more advanced glycation products, due to which oxidative stress and endothelial cell damage may develop. As albuminuria and activity of gamma-GT were both found higher in patients with allele D, and our patients did not suffer of any hepatic disease, authors take the consequence that gamma-GT is a marker of the oxidative stress caused by allele D. Endothelial damage may explain that these patients take a higher number of antihypertensive combination. Based on this, D allele may contribute--via increased glycation and oxidative stress--to the target organ damage in type 2 diabetes.", 
    "458": "IgA nephropathy is one of the most common causes of glomerulonephritis in the world and is characterized histologically by the deposition of polymeric forms of IgA within the mesangium and in some cases along the glomerular capillary wall.(1) Proliferative and crescenteric forms of IgA are associated with nephrotic range proteinuria, accelerated hypertension, and a more rapid decline toward end-stage renal disease. Previous attempts to categorize the incidence and clinical significance of proliferative IgA nephropathy have given conflicting results. This is in part the result of the lack of a uniform nomenclature and the failure of clinical therapies to prolong renal survival in specific subgroups. In the present study, we performed a prospective open-label trial of pulse solumedrol and intravenous cyclophosphamide in 20 patients with IgA nephropathy and at least 10% cellular crescents or endocapillary proliferation on renal biopsy. Seventeen patients underwent repeat kidney biopsies after 6 months of therapy, and the morphologic response to treatment was assessed using a modified systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) histologic activity and chronicity index score. To determine the long-term efficacy of intravenous cyclophosphamide on renal survival, the results of the treated patients were compared with 12 untreated historical controls. Pulse solumedrol and intravenous cyclophosphamide effectively reduced peak serum creatinine, degree of proteinuria, the rate of decline in renal function, and the incidence of end-stage renal disease at 36 months.", 
    "459": "The lengthy course of IgA nephropathy and the possibility of good outcomes without therapy suggest nontoxic therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs.) Among patients with IgA nephropathy, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce the transglomerular passage of large, but not small, molecules, reducing proteinuria. The antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are probably equivalent. Dual ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy reduces proteinuria by 54% to 73% and is more effective than either agent alone. To determine whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs preserve renal function long-term, one must rely on trials studying nondiabetic, proteinuric renal diseases rather than on trials specific to IgA nephropathy. Among this group of patients, several randomized, controlled trials, including the AIPRI trial, the REIN trial, and a metaanalysis of 11 randomized, controlled trials, have established clearly that the ACE inhibitors preserve renal function. There is no reason to believe that this information is not applicable to IgA nephropathy. The COOPERATE trial, in which 50% of the subjects had IgA nephropathy, established that ACE inhibitors and ARBs preserve renal function equally, and that dual ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy preserves renal function more effectively than either therapy alone. These data suggest that most individuals with proteinuric renal diseases, including IgA nephropathy, should be treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, ideally in combination. Polymorphisms of the angiotensinogen gene, the ACE gene, and the angiotensin II type I receptor gene have, so far, failed to predict either susceptibility to or progression of IgA nephropathy. However, the D allele of the ID polymorphism, particularly the DD genotype, could predict a favorable response to renin-angiotensin blockade.", 
    "460": "We have previously reported that hypertension in the young spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is associated with an elevation in tissue angiotensinogen and a novel polysomal protein known to stabilize angiotensinogen mRNA. In our current study we determined the role of the mRNA-stabilizing protein in the regulation of tissue angiotensinogen expression and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the SHR utilizing antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AON) inhibition. Three AONs (RNASTAAS1, position 31-50; RNASTAAS2, position 21-40; RNASTAAS3, position 143-162 of the cDNA coding for the polysomal protein) were administered intravenously (dose 450, 900, and 1,800 microg/kg; 1 dosage/day over 3 days) in conscious, chronically instrumented male SHRs at the age of 7 wk. Control SHRs received corresponding scrambled oligodeoxynucleotide sequences (SCR1, SCR2, SCR3). Each animal received the increasing dose schedule. RNASTAAS2 resulted in a reduced expression of the polysomal protein to 21% (liver), 12% (brain), 27% (heart), 18% (renal cortex), and 22% (renal medulla) of control. Angiotensinogen expression was inhibited to 54% (liver), 41% (brain), 68% (heart), 52% (renal cortex), and 74% (renal medulla) compared with control SHRs. Decreases in plasma concentrations of angiotensinogen and plasma renin activities were associated with a significant decrease in MAP from 147 +/- 6 mmHg (after SCR2) to 106 +/- 4 mmHg after RNASTAAS2. The effects of the two other AONs on MAP were less (RNASTAAS1, -31 mmHg; RNASTAAS3, -16 mmHg) with corresponding decreases in mRNAs coding for angiotensinogen and the polysomal protein. A significant decrease in intracellular concentrations of the polysomal protein accompanied AON inhibition. The magnitude of effects (-15 to -41 mmHg) was comparable to the effects of captopril (100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for 3 days: -32 mmHg) and an AT(1) receptor antagonist (L-158809, 1.5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for 3 days: -36 mmHg). These data suggest an important role of the mRNA-stabilizing protein for hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen expression and MAP in the SHR.", 
    "461": "Hypertension is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular pathology, such as atherosclerosis and cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy, including acute events such as stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). In particular, the risk of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke is directly and continuously related to high blood pressure levels. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in volume homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. It also helps to prevent cell and organ damage from ischaemia during acute volume loss. However, angiotensin-II (A-II)--the main effector peptide of the RAS--also exerts a number of pathological effects, which are mediated by the AT 1 receptor. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global End point Trial (ONTARGET) programme consists of two parallel trials where ONTARGET as a large, long-term study compares the efficacy of the angiotensin-receptor antagonist, telmisartan, the renin-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril and combination therapy with telmisartan plus ramipril for reducing cardiovascular and cerebral risk. Telmisartan, due to its long duration of action, compares favourably with other angiotensin-receptor antagonists. In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, ramipril was shown to reduce the risk for MI and other cardiovascular events in patients at high risk for pathological cardiac events, but without heart failure or a low ejection fraction. The cardiovascular outcomes of high-risk patients using the same criteria as those of the HOPE study will be assessed in both trials. TRANSCEND differs from ONTARGET in that this trial will enrol patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors. This parallel study will therefore be able to compare telmisartan and placebo treatment. Both ONTARGET and TRANSCEND trials feature the same primary composite end point: death caused by cardiovascular disease, acute MI, stroke and hospitalisation because of congestive heart failure. The secondary end points will focus on reductions in the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, nephropathy, cognitive decrease and dementia as well as atrial fibrillation.", 
    "462": "Inflammatory cell infiltration plays a key role in the onset and progression of renal injury. The NF-kappaB participates in the inflammatory response, regulating many proinflammatory genes. Angiotensin II (Ang II), via AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, activates NF-kappaB. Although the contribution of Ang II to kidney damage progression is already established, the receptor subtype involved in the inflammatory cell recruitment is not clear. For investigating this issue, the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was used in mice, blocking Ang II production/receptors and NF-kappaB pathway. Two days after UUO, obstructed kidneys of wild-type mice presented a marked interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and increased NF-kappaB activity. Treatment with AT(1) or AT(2) antagonists partially decreased NF-kappaB activation, whereas only the AT(2) blockade diminished monocyte infiltration. Obstructed kidneys of AT(1)-knockout mice showed interstitial monocyte infiltration and NF-kappaB activation; both processes were abolished by an AT(2) antagonist, suggesting AT(2)/NF-kappaB involvement in monocyte recruitment. In wild-type mice, only angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or combined therapy with AT(1) plus AT(2) antagonists blocked monocyte infiltration, NF-kappaB activation, and upregulation of NF-kappaB-related proinflammatory genes. Therefore, AT(1) and AT(2) blockade is necessary to arrest completely the inflammatory process. Treatment with two different NF-kappaB inhibitors, pirrolidin-dithiocarbamate and parthenolide, diminished monocyte infiltration and gene overexpression. These data show that Ang II, via AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and NF-kappaB pathway, participates in the regulation of renal monocyte recruitment and may provide a rationale to investigate further the role of AT(2) in human kidney diseases.", 
    "463": "A protocol to follow the processing of angiotensin I into angiotensin II by rabbit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its inhibition by a novel natural antagonist, the leech osmoregulator factor (LORF) using capillary zonal electrophoresis is described. The experiment was carried out using the Beckman PACE system and steps were taken to determine (a) the migration profiles of angiotensin and its yielded peptides, (b) the minimal amount of angiotensin II detected, (c) the use of different electrolytes and (d) the concentration of inhibitor. We demonstrated that LORF (IPEPYVWD), a neuropeptide previously found in leech brain, is able to inhibit rabbit ACE with an IC(50) of 19.8 micro m. Interestingly, its cleavage product, IPEP exhibits an IC(50) of 11.5 micro m. A competition assay using p-benzoylglycylglycylglycine and insect ACE established that LORF and IPEP fragments are natural inhibitors for invertebrate ACE. Fifty-four percent of insect ACE activity is inhibited with 50 micro m IPEP and 35% inhibition with LORF (25 mm). Extending the peptide at both N- and C-terminus (GWEIPEPYVWDES) and the cleavage of IPEP in IP abolished the inhibitory activity of both peptides. Immunocytochemical data obtained with antisera raised against LORF and leech ACE showed a colocalization between the enzyme and its inhibitor in the same neurons. These results showed that capillary zonal electrophoresis is a useful technique for following enzymatic processes with small amounts of products and constitutes the first evidence of a natural ACE inhibitor in invertebrates.",

This was largely triggered by fresh insights into the role of aldosterone in a number of key pathophysiological processes, including fibrosis and remodeling, inflammation, and the potentiation of catecholamine effects. The therapeutic efficacy of spironolactone (Aldactone), Pfizer) in severe chronic heart failure was established by the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study, but hormonal side effects (gynecomastia) associated with the drug posed a problem. More recently, the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study has provided firm support for the use of eplerenone (Inspra, Pfizer) in heart failure following acute myocardial infarction in addition to neurohormonal blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers. This strategy can be expected to benefit both mortality and morbidity. Due to the fact that eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, it does not cause troublesome hormonal side effects. This is an important feature of the drug that is likely to help maintain compliance.",

In the 2 trial arms that included patients with LVEF < 40%, incidence of the mortality and hospitalization was significantly lower with candesartan than with placebo. It may be the new evidence of angiotensin receptor blocker on 3 other types of heart failure.", 
    "505": "Individual variation in drug response is considered to have multiple origins arising from interactions among susceptible genes and environmental factors. A total of 726 hypertensive patients who took benazepril 10 mg once a day for 15 days and their families from Huoqiu county of Anhui Province, China, were used to study the association between D919G polymorphism of methionine synthase (MTR) gene and the antihypertensive effect of this angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Compared to the 919D allele, both population-based ( P=0.010) and family-based association tests (additive model P=0.018, dominant model P=0.025) demonstrated that the 919G allele was associated with a significantly less diastolic blood pressure reduction. No significant association was found between the extent of systolic blood pressure reduction and benazepril therapy. Our finding suggests that the D919G polymorphism of the MTR gene may be a useful genetic marker to predict the antihypertensive effect of short-term benazepril therapy in hypertensive patients of Anhui Province, China.", 
    "506": "Secondary prevention includes all measures to lower the risk of a relapse of a specific disease. For secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases general measures and specific drug therapy are employed, according to the individual risk pattern. Among the general measures cessation of smoking is most important. In addition, an increase in daily exercise, a normalization of body weight and a healthy diet all lower the cardiovascular risk. For most cases secondary prevention includes also specific drug therapies. Aspirin, statins and beta-blockers are the cornerstones of this drug therapy. After myocardial infarction most patients will also benefit from an ACE-inhibitor therapy.", 
    "507": "Substance P (SP), which is known as a pain transmitter or modulator in the spinal cord, was degraded by the synaptic membranes of the mouse spinal cord. The major metabolites of SP were phenylalanine, SP(1-6), SP(1-7), SP(1-9), SP(8-9) and SP(10-11). Degradation of SP was inhibited by a metal chelator, o-phenanthroline, and also by specific inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11, thiorphan and phosphoramidon. In contrast, captopril (a specific inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme), bestatin (a specific inhibitor of aminopeptidase) and Z-321 (a specific inhibitor of prolylendopeptidase) showed little effect on the degradation of SP. The accumulation of the major cleavage products was strongly inhibited by phosphoramidon and thirophan, as well as the initial cleavage of SP. Thus, endopeptidase-24.11 plays a major role in SP degradation in the mouse spinal cord. Additional in vivo experiments were performed to investigate the antinociceptive effect of SP(1-7), a major product of SP that was detected after incubation with spinal synaptic membranes. In the mouse tail-flick test, the intrathecal administration of SP(1-7) (1.0-4.0 pmol) increased tail-flick latency in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that degradation of SP by spinal endopeptidase-24.11 may lead to the formation of SP(1-7), which has an ability to produce antinociceptive effects at the mouse spinal cord level.", 
    "508": "Kidney function is critical in determining the level of arterial pressure and in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Important evidence comes from studies in which the level of blood pressure is dictated by the donor when kidneys are transplanted between genetically hypertensive and normotensive rats. We have hypothesized that pharmacotherapy modifies specific properties of the kidney, particularly the vasculature, such that after kidney transplantation, there are persistent changes in the level of arterial pressure. Consistent with previous studies, a 2-week aggressive treatment of adult (15 weeks) spontaneously hypertensive rats with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) combined with a low-salt diet induced a persistent change in the kidney and a decrease in arterial pressure (18%). These persistent changes in arterial pressure could be completely transferred to untreated adult spontaneously hypertensive rats by kidney transplantation (ie, pressure in untreated rats was decreased after transplantation of a kidney donated from a previously treated rat). Further, the importance of kidney-specific changes was demonstrated by finding that the treatment-induced lowering of arterial pressure was completely reversed by transferring an untreated kidney into a previously treated rat. The specific treatment-induced changes to the kidney included a decrease in structurally based renal vascular resistance that was similar to the persistent lowering of arterial pressure. These data provide evidence for a link between the treatment-induced changes in kidney vascular structure and the persistent lowering of arterial pressure. The findings also suggest that a key pharmacotherapeutic target in hypertension should be kidney-specific changes, such as renal vascular structure.", 
    "509": "To compare diverse effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (irbesartan) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (imidapril) on left ventricular remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Thirty male SHR were randomly divided into three groups: SHR-IR (treated with irbesartan, 50 mg/kg), SHR-IM (imidapril, 3 mg/kg), SHR-C (placebo). Ten male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) treated with placebo acted as the control. All treatments were administered once daily from 14 to 27 weeks of age. Imidapril and irbesartan have the similar inhibitor effects on blood pressure and left ventricular mass indexes in SHR. Despite both drugs suppressed ERK-1 protein expression, decreased cardiomyocytes apoptosis index, blocked collagen type I deposition, reduced TGF-beta(1) gene expression in SHR, imidapril elicits a stronger inhibitory effect. Irbesartan had little effect on MKP-1 protein expression, but imidapril decreased it significantly. As a result, the ERK-1/MKP-1 ratio in SHR-IR was significantly greater than that in SHR-IM (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the balance between MKP-1 and ERKs in myocardial tissue is important for cardiac cell proliferation and growth. They also indicate that the similar efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in reducing blood pressure does not predict the similar capacity to control the individual facet of left ventricular remodeling. Irbesartan is more effective in regressing the homeostasis between ERK-1 and MKP-1, however imidapril is superior in suppressing apoptosis and collagen synthesis in cardiac tissue.", 
    "510": "This study investigated patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery to evaluate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the spontaneous variability of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Forty-one adult patients receiving different cardiovascular system drugs were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: no preoperative pharmacological cardiovascular treatment (n = 12), beta-blocker (BB) (n = 13), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) (n = 16). MAP was recorded before anaesthesia until the end of surgery. MAP and HR variability was analysed in very low- (VLF), low- (LF) and high-frequency bands. The LF spectral component of MAP was observed to decrease in patients under ACEI (-92%) or BB (-87%) following induction of anaesthesia. In addition, during CPB, VLF power decreased in BB group (-67%), and LF power decreased in ACEI group (-77%). Concerning HR, VLF spectral power decreased following anaesthesia in BB group (-74%). In addition, after CPB, VLF power reached lower value in ACEI group than in BB group (P < 0.05). LF spectral power of HR showed a large decrease after CPB in ACEI group (-89%). This study showed that MAP variability did not change during CPB in patients with no preoperative pharmacological cardiovascular treatment, suggesting an unaltered vascular control of MAP. Moreover, the change in LF spectral power of MAP in ACEI and BB groups, suggests that both the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems participate to the genesis of LF variability of MAP.", 
    "511": "The present study compared short-term effects of the AT(1)-receptor antagonist, irbesartan with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril on systemic haemodynamics and cardiac remodelling in post-myocardia-infarcted (MI) rats. MI Sprague-Dawley rats were orally treated for 4 weeks with irbesartan (50 mg/kg/day) or enalapril (10 mg/kg/day). Then, cardiac and systemic haemodynamics were measured. Compared with the sham-operated group, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), diastolic pressure (LVDP), heart weight to body weight ratio were all significantly increased in the MI group while the LV contractility (dP/dt) and pulsatile arterial pressure were significantly reduced. Both drugs reduced the elevated LVEDP and LVDP and prevented cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, irbesartan attenuated the right shift of the pressure-volume curves, prevented postinfarction-induced increase in urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate and reduced urinary aldosterone excretion. Although both drugs were able to prevent further cardiac hypertrophy and improved cardiac filling pressure, only irbesartan limited LV dilatation. These data indicate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system at the level of AT1 receptors may have a better cardioprotective benefit than reducing angiotensin II levels by ACE inhibition.", 
    "512": "Dual inhibition of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has gained increasing interest in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and renoprotection. Specifically, M100240, the thioester of the dual ACE/NEP inhibitor MDL100,173, has been evaluated in the management of hypertension. A model-based analysis, including simulations, was employed to characterize the relationship between individual M100240 drug exposure and neurohormonal response and to optimize the dose selection for future clinical studies. Sixty-two healthy subjects and 189 hypertensive patients were studied after oral once-daily administration of 2.5, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg M100240. Pharmacokinetic-biomarker and blood pressure response models were fitted to the data with the computer program NONMEM. A direct inhibitory E(max) model adequately described the relationship between MDL100,173 concentration and ACE activity. No clear concentration or dose-dependent NEP or blood pressure responses were evident. Given a target 90% ACE inhibition, simulation reveals that (1). 50 mg M100240 once daily produces adequate ACE inhibition 24 hours postdose in only 20% of subjects, and (2). higher and/or more frequent doses on the order of 25 mg three times daily or 50 mg twice daily are required to achieve the target ACE inhibition in at least 50% of patients over 24 hours. Insufficient blood pressure-lowering effects were observed in healthy subjects and hypertensive patients due to inadequate ACE and NEP inhibition with once-daily oral doses of up to 50 mg of M100240. Divided doses might provide target ACE inhibition in more patients.", 
    "513": "We investigated the effects of captopril (Cap) and L-arginine (Arg) on hypertension and cardiopulmonary function. Our hypothesis was that Cap therapy or Arg will improve cardiopulmonary risk factors for hypertension and hypoventilation in the obese spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rat, which is characterized by hypertension, obesity, and disorders of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. For the first study, one group of rats received Cap in drinking water, and a second group received deionized water (DI). For the second study, rats were further subdivided. Some Cap-treated rats continued on this treatment, and the other half were now given DI to determine whether there would be residual effects of Cap treatment. A subgroup of rats who had received DI was then given Arg, whereas the rest remained on DI. In the first study, Cap-treated rats exhibited decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, frequency of breathing, and minute ventilation, but ventilatory control was maintained. In contrast, blood pressures and relative ventilation to metabolism were higher in the DI-treated group. Removal of Cap increased blood pressure and decreased tidal volume while these rats maintained frequency. Although Arg-treated rats did not exhibit a decrease of blood pressure, ventilation was maintained in this group by preserving tidal volume. Thus Cap and Arg affected ventilation through different mechanisms independent of blood pressure.", 
    "514": "Control of blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients often fails to meet the targets suggested by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. The optimal treatment target for non-diabetic patients is < or = 140/85 mm Hg. Data from the health survey for England show that in 1998 only 8% of men and 11% of women had blood pressure controlled to < 140/90 mm Hg. The Anglo-Scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial (ASCOT) data show that 87% of non-diabetic patients in the St Mary's Centre are currently treated to below 140/90 mm Hg. These differences can be explained by strict protocol adherence, a focus on cardiovascular disease, longer consultation times and punctual appointments, reinforcement of non-pharmacological advice, and blood pressure readings taken in line with BHS guidelines. Some of these points might be translated into the more challenging setting of primary care.", 
    "515": "Remarkable improvements in morbidity and mortality caused by heart failure have been realized because of a greater understanding of the pathobiologic mechanisms of left ventricular dysfunction and the subsequent application of neurohormonal antagonism to the heart failure milieu. The median survival of patients with chronic heart failure has greatly increased with the use of effective medical therapy that includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, especially carvedilol. Still to be addressed is the issue of clinical trials that under represent special populations of patients who are affected with heart failure (eg, the elderly, women, and African Americans). Even though heart failure may be a somewhat different illness in etiology, epidemiology, or responsiveness to medical therapy for each of these groups, it is of utmost importance that patients affected by heart failure be treated with agents that have been shown to be of benefit in the major controlled clinical trials in heart failure.", 
    "516": "An extensive clinical trials database now exists to support the therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockers in systolic heart failure. However, concerns remain about the tolerability of these agents. These concerns relate to perceived complexity in initiation and uptitration, risk of worsening heart failure clinical status, and delay in beneficial effects on outcomes. All of the above concerns are thought especially relevant in patients with advanced disease. However, these perceptions are not borne out in the controlled clinical trial experience or in open-label studies and postmarketing surveillance programs with carvedilol. Specifically, in clinical studies, discontinuation rates (because of adverse events), serious adverse event rates, mean achieved dose, and percentage reaching target dose strongly suggest good tolerability. This is especially notable, considering that beta-blockade is used in addition to other background neurohormonal antagonists, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Furthermore, tolerability in the everyday community setting also appears to be high. Carvedilol, specifically, is also well tolerated during initiation of therapy, with fewer withdrawals for heart failure during the first 8 weeks of uptitration, and no delay in the accrual of beneficial clinical outcomes, as observed in the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) study. Thus, in contrast to widely held perceptions about tolerability of beta-blockade in heart failure, carvedilol appears to be an extremely well-tolerated agent, even during initiation and in the most advanced patients.", 
    "517": "Left ventricular (LV) remodeling has an important role in the progression of cardiovascular disease. An understanding of the process of LV remodeling has led to greater knowledge of the pathophysiology of heart failure. Drug therapies that slow or reverse the remodeling process seem to have favorable natural history effects in short-term and long-term therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been associated with a significant reduction in mortality, and the effect of beta-blockers on the remodeling process has now been studied across much of the spectrum of severity in patients with heart failure. beta-Blockade seems to add favorable and independent effects on the post-myocardial infarction remodeling process over and above those of ACE inhibitors. A combination of both drugs shows the greatest reduction in mortality (ie, the most favorable reverse remodeling). Differences in their effect on remodeling have been recently shown among the beta-blockers. Several studies and a meta-analysis suggest that carvedilol may be more favorable to outcome, having the most effect on LV remodeling.",

After an average follow-up period of 10.4 months, mortality was reduced by 34% in the carvedilol group. Carvedilol also reduced the number of days spent in the hospital for any cause by 27% and the number of days spent in the hospital for heart failure by 40%. Patients in the carvedilol group felt better and were less likely to have a serious adverse event. The benefits of carvedilol appeared early and were detected during the up-titration period.",

Patients in CAPRICORN were treated with a maximum dose of 25 mg bid and observed until 633 validated primary end points had occurred. Because the overall mortality was lower than had been predicted, a co-primary end point was adopted that included the original primary end point (all-cause mortality) plus the first of the prespecified secondary end points (all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalizations). A significant 23% reduction in the original primary end point of all-cause mortality was observed. A total of 340 (35%) patients died or had a cardiovascular hospitalization in the carvedilol group versus 367 (37%) in the placebo group. Therefore, the revised primary end point of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization was reduced by 8%, which was not statistically significant. Significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, and the combination of all-cause mortality or nonfatal MI were observed. Although statistical significance for the revised primary end point was not reached, CAPRICORN has an important role in guiding future use of beta-blockers in the early post-MI period.",

    "524": "Residual renal function (RRF) remains important even after commencement of dialysis. Its role in the adequacy of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is well recognized and is increasingly utilized in incremental PD regimes, but it is also vitally important in hemodialysis (HD) patients, in whom it, as in PD patients, may improve survival. It may allow for a reduction in the duration of HD sessions. It reduces the need for dietary and fluid restrictions in both PD and HD patients. Other contributions include improved middle molecule clearance, better hemoglobin, phosphate, potassium, and urate levels, enhanced nutritional status and quality of life scores, and better outcomes in pregnancy. On the negative side, hypoalbuminemia may be prolonged in patients with persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria. Contrary to popular belief, RRF does not necessarily decline rapidly with the initiation of HD. PD may be better than HD in preserving RRF, although this difference may not persist if biocompatible membranes, bicarbonate buffer, and ultrapure water are used. Nocturnal ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients may fare worse than continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. RRF can be adversely affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aminoglycosides, and radiocontrast agents.

    "525": "The citric acid cycle is central to the regulation of energy homeostasis and cell metabolism. Mutations in enzymes that catalyse steps in the citric acid cycle result in human diseases with various clinical presentations. The intermediates of the citric acid cycle are present at micromolar concentration in blood and are regulated by respiration, metabolism and renal reabsorption/extrusion. Here we show that GPR91 (ref. 3), a previously orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), functions as a receptor for the citric acid cycle intermediate succinate. We also report that GPR99 (ref. 4), a close relative of GPR91, responds to alpha-ketoglutarate, another intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Thus by acting as ligands for GPCRs, succinate and alpha-ketoglutarate are found to have unexpected signalling functions beyond their traditional roles. Furthermore, we show that succinate increases blood pressure in animals. The succinate-induced hypertensive effect involves the renin-angiotensin system and is abolished in GPR91-deficient mice. Our results indicate a possible role for GPR91 in renovascular hypertension, a disease closely linked to atherosclerosis, diabetes and renal failure.",

Quality improvement interventions were implemented over 17 months after a 6-month baseline period and included: clinical decision support (clinical practice guidelines, reminders, checklists, clinical pathways); educational interventions (seminars, academic detailing); regular performance feedback; patient self-management strategies; and hospital-community integration (discharge referral summaries; community pharmacist liaison; patient prompts to attend GPs). Using a before-after study design to assess program impact, significantly more program patients compared with historical controls received: ACS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and lipid-lowering agents at discharge, aspirin and beta-blockers at 3 months after discharge, inpatient cardiac counselling, and referral to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.

In randomised, double-blind clinical trials, enalapril/nitrendipine 10/20 mg/day was significantly more effective than its individual components in reducing diastolic BP (DBP) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension inadequately controlled with enalapril 10 mg/day or nitrendipine 20 mg/day. The fixed-dose combination was similar in efficacy at reducing DBP to amlodipine 10 mg/day in patients who failed to achieve BP control with amlodipine 5 mg/day, and to losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 mg/day in patients who received the combinations as first-line therapy. Enalapril/nitrendipine 10/20 mg produced a consistent antihypertensive effect that persisted for the entire 24-hour dosage interval as shown by ambulatory BP monitoring. Enalapril/nitrendipine 10/20 mg was well tolerated in clinical trials where it was administered to patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension for up to 12 weeks. The adverse events were those expected of ACE inhibitors and CCAs and included cough, headache and flushing. Evidence from clinical trials, including a pooled analysis, suggests that the incidence of oedema may be significantly lower with the fixed-dose combination than with CCA monotherapy. In conclusion, enalapril/nitrendipine 10/20 mg is a well tolerated fixed-dose combination of two established antihypertensive agents administered once daily that effectively lowers BP throughout the 24-hour dosage interval. Importantly, the fixed-dose combination may have a lower incidence of oedema than CCA monotherapy. Enalapril/nitrendipine 10/20 mg provides an additional treatment option for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension for whom combination therapy is appropriate.",

Beyond that point, however, a close to linear decrease in dissolution was observed as a function of increase in moisture content. Results from thermal and X-ray analysis have ruled out possible changes in drug substance. Other physical characterization, such as scanning electron microscope and mercury porosimetry measurements, revealed changes in core structure of stressed tablets vs. initial tablets. Based on results from these measurements, \"preactivation\" of disintegrant was identified as the mechanism for reduction in dissolution rate above critical moisture content. A simple physical model for moisture uptake of benazepril hydrochloride tablets was also proposed for predicting when, based on water vapor transmission and critical moisture content, dissolution rate will decline.", 
    "535": "Physical changes of tablets mediated by moisture were the main cause for reduction in dissolution. Inclusion of desiccant, although beneficial, cannot prevent reduction in dissolution completely. The simple physical model proposed in this report was found to be useful in predicting the dissolution stability of the dosage form.",

    "540": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve endothelial function in Type 1 diabetes. However, the potential of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) to enhance the haemodynamic effects of L-arginine (L-arg), the precursor of nitric oxide (NO), has not been evaluated. Furthermore, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), another group of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), have not been studied in this context.", 
    "541": "Using a randomised, crossover design, the acute effects of L-arg (200 mg/kg) on blood pressure (BP) and renal haemodynamics were determined in uncomplicated Type 1 diabetic patients before and after three weeks of treatment with the ACE-I ramipril (5 mg/day) or the ARB losartan (50 mg/day).", 
    "542": "L-arg alone did not influence BP or renal haemodynamics. BP responses to L-arg were not modulated by ACE-I or ARB. In contrast to the systemic responses, L-arg induced significant renal vasodilation after treatment with ramipril (p<0.05). Unlike ramipril, losartan did not modulate renal haemodynamic responses to L-arg. L-arg administration was paralleled by increments in plasma L-citrulline levels, determined as a measure of L-arg-induced systemic NO production. These responses were not influenced by RAS inhibitors. No changes in other indicators of the systemic and renal NO production, such as plasma and urinary nitrates/nitrites, were detected in response to L-arg alone or after treatment with RAS inhibitors.", 
    "543": "ACE-Is have greater potential than ARBs to enhance L-arg effects in the kidney in uncomplicated Type 1 diabetes. Neither RAS inhibitor influenced the systemic effects of L-arg. The lack of changes in renal NO indicators parallelling the haemodynamic responses, suggests that the effects of ACE-I on L-arg-induced renal haemodynamic changes could be also attributable to NO-independent mechanisms.", 
    "544": "In patients with myocardial infarction (MI)-induced heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are proven effective therapy in inhibiting the progression towards overt heart failure. However, the prognosis in these patients is still very poor, and optimisation of therapy is warranted. The antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) can be substantially enhanced by dietary sodium restriction. In line with the latter, the aim of the present study was to explore whether dietary sodium restriction enhances the efficacy of ACE-I after MI.", 
    "545": "Rats with MI-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction received ACE-I therapy with zofenopril (5.5 mg/kg/day orally), with or without dietary sodium restriction. ACE activity was measured in non-infarcted LV tissue, kidneys and plasma. Effects on cardiac hypertrophy were examined by means of organ weight/body weight ratios. After blood pressure (BP) measurements, functional consequences of therapy were evaluated as LV pressure development in isolated perfused hearts.", 
    "546": "Dietary sodium restriction alone had no effect on any of the measured parameters, whereas zofenopril alone significantly reduced plasma and kidney ACE activity, but not LV ACE activity, nor LV weight/body weight ratio. However, only when ACE-I therapy was combined with dietary sodium restriction was LV ACE activity significantly reduced. This effect was paralleled by inhibition of LV hypertrophy. BP was reduced after infarction, and further reduced by zofenopril, but not affected by dietary sodium. Neither treatment was associated with effects on the MI-induced reduction of LV function in vitro.", 
    "547": "Effects of ACE inhibition with zofenopril can be potentiated by additional dietary sodium restriction. However, these effects were tissue-specific, since LV, but not kidney or plasma, ACE activity was affected by the additional dietary sodium restriction. Effects on LV ACE activity were paralleled by reduced LV hypertrophy. Since the measured parameters did not indicate any adverse side-effects, dietary sodium restriction may provide a safe strategy to improve ACE-I efficacy in patients with infarction-induced LV dysfunction.",

Ten dipeptides were isolated from the extract by several steps of chromatography, and their amino acid sequences were Tyr-His, Lys-Trp, Lys-Tyr, Lys-Phe, Phe-Tyr, Val-Trp, Val-Phe, Ile-Tyr, Ile-Trp, and Val-Tyr. Both single administration and repeated oral administration of synthetic Tyr-His, Lys-Tyr, Phe-Tyr, and Ile-Tyr significantly decreased blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "549": "Our investigations started when synthetic bradykinin became available and we could characterize two enzymes that cleaved it: kininase I or plasma carboxypeptidase N and kininase II, a peptidyl dipeptide hydrolase that we later found to be identical with the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). When we noticed that ACE can cleave peptides without a free C-terminal carboxyl group (e.g., with a C-terminal nitrobenzylamine), we investigated inactivation of substance P, which has a C-terminal Met(11)-NH(2). The studies were extended to the hydrolysis of the neuropeptide, neurotensin and to compare hydrolysis of the same peptides by neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase 24.11, CD10, NEP). Our publication in 1984 dealt with ACE and NEP purified to homogeneity from human kidney. NEP cleaved substance P (SP) at Gln(6)-Phe(7), Phe(7)[see text]-Phe(8), and Gly(9)-Leu(10) and neurotensin (NT) at Pro(10)-Tyr(11) and Tyr(11)-Ile(12). Purified ACE also rapidly inactivated SP as measured in bioassay. HPLC analysis showed that ACE cleaved SP at Phe(8)-Gly(9) and Gly(9)-Leu(10) to release C-terminal tri- and dipeptide (ratio = 4:1). The hydrolysis was Cl(-) dependent and inhibited by captopril. ACE released only dipeptide from SP free acid. ACE hydrolyzed NT at Tyr(11)-Ile(12) to release Ile(12)-Leu(13). Then peptide substrates were used to inhibit ACE hydrolyzing Fa-Phe-Gly-Gly and NEP cleaving Leu(5)-enkephalin. The K(i) values in microM were as follows: for ACE, bradykinin = 0.4, angiotensin I = 4, SP = 25, SP free acid = 2, NT = 14, and Met(5)-enkephalin = 450, and for NEP, bradykinin = 162, angiotensin I = 36, SP = 190, NT = 39, Met(5)-enkephalin = 22. These studies showed that ACE and NEP, two enzymes widely distributed in the body, are involved in the metabolism of SP and NT. Below we briefly survey how NEP and ACE in two decades have gained the reputation as very important factors in health and disease. This is due to the discovery of more endogenous substrates of the enzymes and to the very broad and beneficial therapeutic applications of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "550": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides can induce antihypertensive effects after oral administration. By means of an ACE inhibitory peptide database, containing about 500 reported sequences and their IC(50) values, the different proteins in pea and whey were quantitatively evaluated as precursors for ACE inhibitory peptides. This analysis was combined with experimental data from the evolution in ACE inhibitory activity and protein degradation during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Pea proteins produced similar in silico scores and were degraded early in the in vitro digestion. High ACE inhibitory activity was observed after the simulated stomach phase and augmented slightly in the simulated small intestine phase. The major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin obtained the highest in silico scores, which corresponded with the fact that degradation of this protein in vitro only occurred from the simulated small intestine phase on and resulted in a 10-fold increase in the ACE inhibitory activity. Whey protein obtained total in silico scores of about 124 ml/mg, compared to 46 ml/mg for pea protein, indicating that whey protein would be a richer source of ACE inhibitory peptides than pea protein. Although beta-lactoglobulin is only partially digested, a higher ACE inhibitory activity was indeed found in the whey (IC(50) = 0.048 mg/ml) compared to the pea digest (IC(50) = 0.076 mg/ml). In silico gastrointestinal digestion of the highest scoring proteins in pea and whey, vicilin and albumin PA2, and beta-lactoglobulin, respectively, directly released a number of potent ACE inhibitory peptides. Several other ACE inhibitory sequences resisted in silico digestion by gastrointestinal proteases. Briefly, the quantitative in silico analysis will facilitate the study of precursor proteins on a large scale and the specific release of bioactive peptides.", 
    "551": "The author showed direct evidence that blood vessels are aldosteronogenic. The expression of CYP11B2 mRNA and synthesis of vascular aldosterone were decreased in rats treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Angiotensin II increased production of aldosterone in blood vessels. Vascular aldosterone and CYP11B2 mRNA levels of 2-week-old SHRSPs were significantly increased compared with that in WKY rats of the same age. High sodium intake develops and accelerates vascular injury and cardiac hypertrophy in SHRSP. Plasma aldosterone concentrations and plasma renin concentration were decreased by high salt intake in SHRSP. Aldosterone production, the expression of CYP11B2 mRNA and type I angiotensin II receptor (ATiR) mRNA in blood vessels were significantly increased by high salt intake. These results suggest that high salt intake increases aldosterone production and expression of the ATiR mRNA in the vascular tissue in SHRSP, which may contribute to the development of malignant hypertension in salt-loaded SHRSP.", 
    "552": "Aldosterone blockade has been shown to be effective in reducing total mortality as well as hospitalization for heart failure in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction (SLVD) due to chronic heart failure and in patients with SLVD post acute myocardial infarction. The evidence for the effectiveness of aldosterone blockade in chronic heart failure comes from the randomized aldactone evaluation study (RALES) while that for patients post infarction from the eplerenone post acute myocardial infarction efficacy and survival study (EPHESUS). These studies suggest that mineralocorticoid receptor activation remains important despite the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocking (ARB) agent and a beta blocker. Increasing evidence suggest that aldosterone blockade has important effects not only on the kidney but on ventricular remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, autonomic balance, fibrinolysis, oxidative stress, and activation of the NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling pathways. The results of these studies in patients with SLVD has important implications not only for patients with chronic heart failure and post infarction but also for the therapy of patients with essential hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "553": "Patients with cardiac syndrome X (typical chest pain and normal coronary arteriograms) represent a heterogeneous syndrome, which encompasses different pathogenic mechanisms. Although symptoms in most patients with cardiac syndrome X are non-cardiac, a sizable proportion of them have angina pectoris due to transient myocardial ischemia. Thus radionuclide myocardial perfusion defects, coronary sinus oxygen saturation abnormalities and pH changes, myocardial lactate production and stress-induced alterations of cardiac high energy phosphate suggest an ischemic origin of symptoms in at least a proportion of patients with cardiac syndrome X. Microvascular abnormalities, caused by endothelial dysfunction, appear to be responsible for myocardial ischemia in patients with cardiac syndrome X. Endothelial dysfunction is likely to be multifactorial in these patients and it is conceivable that risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking can contribute to its development. Most patients with cardiac syndrome X are postmenopausal women and estrogen deficiency has been therefore proposed as a pathogenic factor in female patients. Additional factors such as abnormal pain perception may contribute to the pathogenesis of chest pain in patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms. Although prognosis is good regarding survival, patients with cardiac syndrome X have an impaired quality of life. Management of this syndrome represents a major challenge to the treating physician. Understanding the mechanism underlying the condition is of vital importance for patient management. Thus diagnostic tests should aim at identifying the cause of the symptoms in the individual patient, i.e. myocardial ischemia, increased pain perception, abnormalities of adrenergic tone, non-cardiac mechanisms, etc. Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that treatment of cardiac syndrome X should be mainly directed towards improving quality of life, as prognosis is usually good in these patients. Conventional antianginal agents such nitrates, calcium channel antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and nicorandil are effective particularly in patients in whom chest pain and ECG changes are clearly suggestive of myocardial ischemia and in those with objective documentation of ischemia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to be useful in syndrome X patients with increased adrenergic tone, borderline systemic hypertension, and those with documented endothelial dysfunction. Analgesic interventions of different sorts have been proposed based on the hypothesis that somatic and visceral perception of pain is altered in cardiac syndrome X patients. Pharmacological agents such as imipramine and aminophylline, and neural electrical stimulation techniques have been assessed in recent years with encouraging results. Psychological treatment, particularly cognitive therapy, appears to be useful in defined patient subsets. Relaxation techniques such as transcendental meditation have been successfully used in small studies and shown to improve not only chest pain but also exercise-induced ST segment changes. Reports indicate that these techniques improve quality of life.",

Ten homogeneous Wistar Kyoto rats, 5 males and 5 females, weighing 206+/-49 g, were selected as normal control group (WKY group). Systolic pressure was measured on d 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 during the experiment and the rats were killed at the end of the experiment. Angiotensin II (Ang II) level in plasma and mesenteric arteries was measured by radioimmunoassay. The morphology of the secondary branches of mesenteric artery were examined by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor TGF-beta1 and c-Jun mRNA.",

Ang II level in plasma and mesenteric arteries in SHR group was the same or lower than that in WKY group, and was higher in irbesartan group and lower in imidapril group. The remodeling of mesenteric arteries in SHR group was mostly obvious among the 4 groups. The ratio of TGF-beta1 absorbed light value to GAPDH absorbed light value in the SHR group was 0.887+/-0.019, which was significantly higher than that in WKY group, imidapril group, and irbesartan group with the ratios of 0.780+/-0.018, 0.803+/-0.005, and 0.847+/-0.017, respectively (P<0.01).

Under-reporting and reporting biases due to selective ADR reporting provide very serious problems in pharmacovigilance. In the year 2001, the number of reported ADRs increased due to reports of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough; this coincided with limits being imposed on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. These factors provide an example of selective ADR reporting, deforming the quality of drug safety monitoring. They also indicate that administrative strategies can significantly affect spontaneous reporting activities.",

    "560": "A subgroup analysis of a large US community trial was conducted to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), in 3159 patients who lacked blood pressure (BP) control at entry with previous antihypertensive therapy. Patients received 4 mg perindopril daily for 6 weeks. Based on physicians' assessment of BP response, the patients were then either maintained on 4 mg daily (group 1) or the dose was increased to 8 mg daily (group 2) for an additional 6 weeks. The mean baseline sitting BP was 158.2/92.9 mm Hg. Perindopril monotherapy produced a significant BP decrease from baseline of 11.6/6.5 mm Hg and 14.9/8.4 mm Hg at weeks 6 and 12, respectively. In group 1 patients, the majority of BP decrease occurred at week 6 (17.3/9.5 mm Hg) and was maintained until the end of week 12 (18.2/10.1 mm Hg). In group 2 patients, the BP decrease on the 4-mg dose was modest at week 6 by 5.2/3.1 mm Hg. However, further dose up-titration of perindopril to 8 mg resulted in a clinically significant BP decrease of 11.9/6.8 mm Hg from baseline to week 12. Significant antihypertensive effects of perindopril were also demonstrated in the special patient populations of elderly (>or=65 years), black, isolated systolic hypertension, patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases, and patients nonresponsive to other ACEI therapy. Overall, BP control (<140/<90 mm Hg) was achieved in 40.0% of patients at week 12. Perindopril was well tolerated with cough and angioedema reported in 8.5% and 0.4% patients, respectively. Physicians assessed therapeutic response to perindopril as satisfactory in 73.8% patients who were nonresponsive to previous antihypertensive therapy. These results suggest that, in a community-based practice, perindopril monotherapy (4-8 mg/d) is an effective and safe therapeutic option in patients nonresponsive to previous antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "561": "Symptomatic heart failure interferes with a patient's quality of life (QOL) by limiting his or her ability to perform physical tasks and daily activities and by lowering his or her sense of psychological well-being. Therefore, in addition to decreasing mortality and morbidity, improving QOL should be an important goal when selecting pharmacotherapy. QOL questionnaires, both generic and disease specific, are used widely, but in randomized controlled trials of heart failure treatments, QOL has not been a routine study end point. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, medications widely used in the management of heart failure and hypertension--one of the most common causes of heart failure--have been associated with negative, neutral, and modestly positive QOL effects. Angiotensin receptor blockers, combined with other therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (usually with a diuretic) and/or b blockers in heart failure, have produced improvements in QOL. Patients with hypertension whose blood pressure has been lowered have also experienced an improvement in QOL scores. With current heart failure regimens prolonging life, improving QOL becomes an even more essential end point in assessing the effectiveness of new medications, whether used alone or in combination with standard therapy.", 
    "562": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in both young and elderly persons; therefore, good blood pressure control is at the center of improved cardiovascular health. The recently issued seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure and the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology 2003 guidelines for hypertension management emphasize the importance of treatment efficacy rather than age in treating elderly persons with hypertension. Most hypertension clinical trials have been carried out with younger hypertensives, but this is changing with trials such as the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the first Swedish Trial of Old Patients With Hypertension, and the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial. These trials have clearly demonstrated the benefits of good blood pressure control in reducing the risk of stroke in elderly persons. With many safe and effective antihypertensive drugs on the market, the question becomes how elderly persons should be treated. Elderly patients often have isolated systolic hypertension, which is related to loss of arterial elasticity or compliance with aging and is more recalcitrant to treatment than essential hypertension. In addition, with advancing age there is the likelihood that other disease states are present in addition to hypertension. The newer antihypertensive drugs that interfere with the renin angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, have the potential of improving cardiovascular outcomes in elderly persons in addition to offering effective blood pressure reduction. Their use should be considered within a comprehensive risk assessment that includes individualized risk-benefit considerations.",

All visits for hypertension in 1999 and 2000 were reviewed. Survey weights were applied to obtain national estimates. Provision of therapies by gender and race/ethnicity (white, African American, Hispanic, Asian) was examined. Over 137 million visits for hypertension care were made during 1999 and 2000. Diet and exercise counseling were performed at a low percentage of visits (35% and 26% of visits, respectively). The most common antihypertensive agent prescribed was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (28%), while first-line drugs, diuretics (23%) and b blockers (15%), which are recommended by national committees, were prescribed less frequently. Asians and Hispanics were more likely to receive counseling on diet (Asians: odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-3.60; Hispanics: OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.18-5.33) and exercise (Asians: OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.35-4.42; Hispanics: OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.50-7.21) than non-Hispanic whites.

This study investigated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components and a number of inflammatory mediators in left ventricular biopsies from 2-vessel disease unstable angina (UA) (n=43) and stable angina (SA) (n=15) patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Biopsy samples from 6 patients undergoing valve replacement for mitral stenosis served as controls. UA patients were randomly assigned to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor (ramipril), AT1 antagonist (valsartan), or placebo and treated during the 5 days preceding coronary bypass surgery, performed from 6 to 9 days after coronary angiography. During coronary angiography coronary blood flow was measured and samples were obtained from aorta and coronary sinus for determination of Ang I and Ang II gradients. The hearts of UA patients produced Ang II in a greater amount than in SA patients (P<0.01). UA biopsy samples showed numerous DR+ cells, identified as lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed overexpression of AGTN, ACE, and AT1-R genes, as well as upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and iNOS genes (P<0.01), with no differences between nonischemic and potentially ischemic areas. AGTN, ACE, and cytokine genes were mainly localized on endothelial cells. Ramipril and valsartan markedly decreased the expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and iNOS, and, to a lesser extent, of IFN-gamma genes, but did not affect the number of DR+ cells, with no significant difference between the 2 treatments. These results show that locally generated Ang II amplifies the immunomediated inflammatory process of coronary microvessels occurring in unstable angina.",

The greater antifibrotic effect of ramipril at the maximal therapeutic doses employed may not be explained by different antiproteinuric or blood pressure lowering properties, but by-in contrast to candesartan-its ability to hinder the proinflammatory, profibrotic activation of the angiotensin receptor 2.", 
    "579": "Hypertension frequently coexists with diabetes mellitus, occurring twice as frequently in diabetic as in nondiabetic persons. It accounts for up to 75% of added cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with diabetes, contributing significantly to the overall morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. Patients with hypertension are two times more prone to have diabetes than are normotensive persons. Hypertension substantially increases the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, retinopathy, and nephropathy. In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension usually clusters with the other components of the cardiometabolic syndrome, such as microalbuminuria, central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypercoagulation, increased inflammation, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In type 1 diabetes, hypertension often occurs subsequent to the development of diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension in people with diabetes is characterized by volume expansion, increased salt sensitivity, isolated systolic blood pressure (BP) elevation, loss of the nocturnal dipping of BP and pulse, and increased propensity toward orthostatic hypotension and albuminuria. Among the treatment strategies tested in hypertensive diabetic persons, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering to less than 100 mg/dL and aggressive BP control to less than 130/80 mm Hg have proven effective in CVD risk reduction. The combination of two or more drugs is usually necessary to achieve the target BP.", 
    "580": "Most of the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on blood pressure (BP), cardiovascular remodeling, and atherosclerosis are mediated by Ang II type 1 (AT1)-receptor activation. This explains why Ang-II-decreasing or blocking drugs have been successful in decreasing global cardiovascular morbimortality in patients with cardiac complications. However, in primary or secondary stroke prevention trials in patients with low cardiac risk, b-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), which decrease Ang II formation, seem to be less protective than thiazides and dihydropyridines, which increase Ang II. When compared with a beta-blocker, an Ang II-increasing AT1-receptor blocker better protects against stroke but not against cardiac events, whereas an ACEI gives the same protection against both cardiac and cerebral events. This dissociation between blood-pressure-independent cardiac and cerebral protection between b-blockers or ACEIs versus AT1-blockers in patients with low cardiac risk can be best explained if, besides the beneficial vascular effect of AT1-receptor blunting, there is evidence of a beneficial effect of non-AT1-receptor activation. In this review, we present experimental evidence for AT2- and AT4-receptor-mediated brain-anti-ischemic mechanisms and propose a direct comparison of AT1-blockers with ACEIs to prove the clinical effectiveness of non-AT1-mediated mechanisms in stroke prevention, particularly in patients with a higher risk for stroke than for cardiac complications.", 
    "581": "Microalbuminuria is an independent marker of cardiovascular risk, irrespective of kidney disease. Recent pharmacologic interventions have resulted in a significant delay and even an arrest in the progression of microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria or to chronic kidney disease. Focus should be placed on agents that not only lower blood pressure but also improve albuminuria levels. Current guidelines recommend that hypertensive patients with renal disease should be started on agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The use of three to four different agents is frequently necessary to reach the guideline goal blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg.", 
    "582": "This study aimed to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of screening men for their angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-genotype before starting statin therapy. We used a combination of decision-analytic and Markov modelling techniques to evaluate the long-term incremental clinical and economic effects associated with genetic testing of men with hypercholesterolemia before starting treatment with statins. The study was performed from a health care payer perspective. We used data from the Rotterdam study, a prospective population-based cohort study in the Netherlands, which was started in 1990 and included 7983 subjects aged 55 years and older. Men treated with cholesterol-lowering drugs at baseline or with a baseline total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol/l were included. The ratio of difference in lifelong costs between the screening strategy and the no screening strategy to difference in life expectancy between these strategies was calculated. We also performed a cost-utility analysis. The base case was a 55-year-old man with hypercholesterolemia who was initially untreated. Several univariate sensitivity analyses were performed. All costs were discounted with an annual rate of 5%. Screening men for their ACE-genotype was the dominant strategy for the base case analysis, because the screening strategy saved money (851 Euro), but life expectancy was not changed. Screening was the dominant strategy for all age-groups in our cohort. Even in 80-year-old subjects, with the shortest life-expectancy, it was cheaper to screen than to give lifelong treatment to men with a DD genotype without success. Even if all DD subjects were treated with other (non-statin) cholesterol-lowering drugs, screening remained the cost-effective strategy. The results of the cost-utility analysis were similar. Discounting the effects with 5% per year also had no major impact on the conclusions. If other studies confirm that men with the DD genotype do not benefit from treatment with statins, screening for ACE genotype in men most likely will be a cost-effective strategy before initiating statin therapy.",

The double-blind trial ended after a median follow-up of 2.0 years (range 1-97 months). Of 4409 patients still alive, 3517 received open-label treatment consisting of nitrendipine (10-40 mg daily) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg daily), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg daily), or both add-on drugs. Non-participants (n = 892) were also followed up.",

During the 4-year open-label follow-up, stroke and cardiovascular complications occurred at similar frequencies in patients formerly randomized to placebo and those continuing active treatment. These rates were similar to those previously observed in the active-treatment group during the double-blind trial. Considering the total follow-up of 4695 randomized patients, immediate compared with delayed antihypertensive treatment reduced the occurrence of stroke and cardiovascular complications by 28% (P = 0.01) and 15% (P = 0.03), respectively, with a similar tendency for total mortality (13%, P = 0.09).

Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulates these changes, we investigated the effects of 8 weeks of treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril (RAM), or a dual ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, MDL-100240 (MDL), on mesenteric small artery structure and ECM proteins in mRen2-transgenic rats (TGRs), an animal model of hypertension with severe cardiovascular damage.",

Mesenteric small arteries were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph. The media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) was then calculated. Vascular metalloproteinase (MMP) content was evaluated by zymography.", 
    "593": "In untreated TGRs severe hypertension was associated with inward eutrophic remodelling of small arteries. Both RAM and MDL prevented the increase in blood pressure and M/L and decreased MMPs. Icatibant blunted the effect of MDL on BP, M/L and MMPs.",

Three of the silanediols exhibit levels of inhibition that are similar to those of corresponding ketones reported by Almquist. For the fourth diastereomer, with both stereogenic carbons inverted relative to the most active isomer, the ketone gives the least enzyme inhibition whereas the silanediol shows a surprisingly low IC50 value.", 
    "596": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and yet remains under-recognized and under-treated. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of lower extremity PAD and pharmacological interventions that alter this central pathogenic role of atherosclerosis may alter the natural history of PAD. There is growing evidence that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a significant mediator of this disease process and that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with vasculoprotective effects that are independent of the antihypertensive properties of these agents. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that ACE inhibitors directly inhibit the atherosclerotic process and improve vascular endothelial function. In patients with PAD, ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve peripheral circulation as measured by peripheral arterial blood pressure and by increases in peripheral blood flow. Preliminary evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors might improve clinical symptoms in patients with PAD. Recent evidence has confirmed that ACE inhibition is associated with a decrease in morbidity and mortality in patients with arterial disease without left ventricular dysfunction; this benefit was at least as great for the subset of patients with PAD. Overall, these data support a significant role for the RAS in the pathogenesis of all atherosclerotic diseases (including PAD) and suggest that the benefit is independent of the blood pressure lowering properties of these agents. These studies suggest that ACE inhibitor therapy should be considered in the routine management of individuals with PAD, regardless of whether they have hypertension or left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "597": "In the international and the Hungarian guidelines, the diuretics in the first line of the treatment of hypertension. Their sometimes false judgment is based on the side effects, because of the over dosage of the applied medication. According to finished studies, efficiency of thiazides is usually the same as that of their competitors in influencing of the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thiazides have to be given in the first line an antihypertensive treatment to the patients, especially if they are old, or have a great risk for a cardiovascular complication (stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy). In the case of natrium-retention (diabetes, obesity, nephropathy), the treatment without diuretics is not effective. Thiazides make stronger the effects especially of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta receptor blockers. The newer diuretics--with fewer side effects--have very likely extrarenal way of effects, so their long time application seems very favourable.", 
    "598": "This study was designed to test the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on body composition and physical performance in aged rats. Male Brown Norway x F344 rats were randomized to receive daily injections of enalapril (40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg) or saline from 24 to 30 months of age. Body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and physical performance was assessed using the grip strength and inclined plane procedures. Performance measures were assessed at baseline and monthly thereafter. DXA was performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months of follow-up. Compared with the enalapril groups, the saline group experienced a greater 6-month decline in the physical performance measures. Lean body mass declined in both groups; however, the enalapril groups also experienced a significant loss of fat mass. These results suggest that ACE inhibition may prevent age-related declines in physical performance, which may be mediated by a reduction in body fat mass.", 
    "599": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, partially because of its pro-oxidative properties. We questioned the effect and mechanisms of action of administration of aldosterone to apolipoprotein E-deficient (E(0)) mice on their macrophages and aorta oxidative status and the ability of pharmacological agents to block this effect.",

Mouse aortic atherosclerotic lesion area and macrophage and aortic oxidative status were evaluated. Aldosterone administration enhanced the mouse atherosclerotic lesion area by 32%. Mouse peritoneal macrophages and aortic segments from aldosterone-treated mice exhibited increased superoxide anion formation by up to 155% and 69%, respectively, and this effect was probably mediated by NADPH oxidase activation, because increased translocation of its cytosolic component p47phox to the macrophage plasma membrane was observed. THP-1 macrophages incubated in vitro with aldosterone (10 micromol/L) exhibited a higher capacity to release superoxide ions by 110% and increased ability to oxidize LDL by 74% compared with control cells. Aldosterone administration enhanced mouse peritoneal macrophage ACE activity and mRNA expression by 2.3-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively. Only cotreatment of eplerenone with ramipril or losartan completely blocked the oxidative effects of aldosterone.", 
    "601": "Aldosterone administration to E(0) mice increased macrophage oxidative stress and atherosclerotic lesion development.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to compare the distributions of genotypes between cases and the comparison group while controlling for age, sex, body mass, diabetes, and hypertension. Significant associations were found with polymorphisms in thrombospondin-4 (THBS4), thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI2), the strongest being with the A387P variant in THBS4 (p = 0.002). The THBS2 and THBS4 associations have since been replicated. We evaluated polymorphisms in 40 genes previously associated with coronary heart disease and found significant (p<0.05) associations with 10: ACE, APOE, F7, FGB, GP1BA, IL1RN, LRP1, MTHFR, SELP, and THPO. For five of these genes, the polymorphism associated in our study was different from that previously reported, suggesting linkage disequilibrium as an explanation for failure to replicate associations consistently across studies. We found strong linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms within and between genes, especially on chromosome 1q22-q25, a region containing several candidate genes.",

By comparing gene expression profiles from normal and abnormal human testes with those from comparable infertile mouse models, we endeavored to identify genes and gene networks critical for male fertility. We used commercially available filter-based DNA arrays to analyze testicular gene expression from eight human testis biopsies and three different infertile mouse models (atrichosis mutation, ataxia telangiectasia knockout and CREMtau knockout). Forty-seven mouse genes exhibited differential testicular gene expression (P <0.01) associated with male infertility. These included genes involved in DNA repair (Vim, Rad23A, Rad23B), glutathione metabolism (Gsr, Gstp 1, Mgst1), proteolysis (Ace, Casp1, Ctsd), spermatogenesis (Prlr, Tmsb4 and Zfp-37) and stress response (Hsp 1, Osp94). The expression of 19 human genes was different (P<0.05) between normal and abnormal samples, including those associated with apoptosis (GADD45), gonad development (SOX9), proteolysis (PSMC3, SPINK2, TIMP3, UBE213) and signal transduction (DLK1, NAP4, S100A10). Direct comparison of differentially expressed human and mouse genes identified glucose phosphate isomerase, and the highly similar human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and mouse Timp2. Using DNA microarrays to profile gene expression in testes from infertile animal models and humans will be useful for understanding congenital infertility, and also infertility caused by environmental exposures where the same genes and molecular mechanisms are involved.",

In contrast, there were no differences in changes in ejection fraction based on prior angina. Maximal creatine kinase was significantly lower in patients with prior angina (2,119 +/- 1,729 vs. 2,701 +/- 2,088, p = 0.016). In a multivariate model, prior angina remained protective for ventricular remodeling after adjusting for age, gender, baseline ejection fraction, Killip class, baseline end-diastolic volume, and drug treatment group (p = 0.042). However, the protective effect of pre-infarction angina appeared to be attenuated in diabetic patients.",

Data collected during a clinical trial that evaluated rapidity of medication up-titration with blood pressure response to monotherapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril were used to characterize response in 533 black and 2046 white participants. Our objectives were to examine the influence of race and other factors on blood pressure response and to assess the degree to which nonrace factors account for apparent racial differences in response. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses (baseline minus follow-up) to treatment were assessed with treatment groups combined. Crude systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses averaged 4.7 and 2.4 mm Hg less, respectively, in black compared with white participants; however, the response distributions largely overlapped. In multivariate linear regression models adjusted for study design variables and measured participant characteristics, the racial difference in systolic response was reduced by 51% to 2.3 mm Hg, and diastolic response by 21% to 1.9 mm Hg. In these models, participant characteristics, including age, gender, body size, and pretreatment blood pressure severity, significantly predicted either attenuated or enhanced blood pressure response to treatment. Our findings demonstrate that a large source of variability of blood pressure response to treatment is within, not between, racial groups, and that factors that vary at the level of the individual contribute to apparent racial differences in response to treatment.",

    "659": "Prediction of biological targets for molecules from their chemical structures is beneficial for generating focused libraries, selecting compounds for screening, and annotating biological activities for those compounds whose activities are unknown. We studied the ability of a probabilistic neural network (PNN), a variant of normalized radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, to predict biological activities for a set of 799 compounds having activities against seven biological targets. The compounds were taken from the MDDR database, and they were carefully selected to comprise distinct biological activities and diverse structures. The structural characteristics of compounds were represented by a set of 24 atom-type descriptors defined by 2D topological chemical structures. The modeling was done in two ways: (1). compounds having one certain activity were discriminated from those not having that activity and (2). all compounds were classified into seven biological classes. In both cases, around 90% of the compounds were correctly classified. Further validation of the modeled PNNs was done with 26 317 compounds having biological activities against various targets except for the seven targets used for modeling, and 67-98% compounds were correctly classified depending upon the targets. A PNN trains much more quickly than widely used neural networks such as a feed-forward neural network with error back-propagation. Calculation of atom-type descriptors is easy even for a large-size chemical library. Combination of PNN and atom-type descriptors thus provides a powerful way to predict biological activities from structural information.", 
    "660": "Dietary calcium plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy metabolism because high-calcium diets attenuate adipocyte lipid accretion and weight gain during the overconsumption of an energy-dense diet and increase lipolysis and preserve thermogenesis during caloric restriction, which thereby markedly accelerates weight loss. Intracellular Ca(2+) plays a key regulatory role in adipocyte lipid metabolism and triacylglycerol storage; increased intracellular Ca(2+) results in the stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis and the suppression of lipolysis, which results in increased lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, the increased calcitriol produced in response to low-calcium diets stimulates adipocyte Ca(2+) influx and, consequently, promotes adiposity, whereas higher-calcium diets inhibit lipogenesis, inhibit diet-induced obesity in mice, and promote lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and thermogenesis. Notably, dairy sources of calcium markedly attenuate weight and fat gain and accelerate fat loss to a greater degree than do supplemental sources of calcium. This augmented effect of dairy products relative to supplemental calcium is likely due to additional bioactive compounds, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the rich concentration of branched-chain amino acids in whey, which act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity. These concepts are confirmed by epidemiologic data and recent clinical trials, which indicate that diets that include > or =3 daily servings of dairy products result in significant reductions in adipose tissue mass in obese humans in the absence of caloric restriction and markedly accelerate weight and body fat loss secondary to caloric restriction compared with diets low in dairy products. These data indicate an important role for dairy products in both the prevention and treatment of obesity.",

Plasma concentrations of enalaprilat (CAS 76420-72-9), the pharmacologically active metabolite of enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide were determined by a validated GC/MS and HPLC assay, respectively. Serial blood samples were collected prior to each administration and at 19 timepoints within 36 h after dosing. The parametric 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean values of the test/reference ratios for enalaprilat were 99.3% to 118.9% (point estimate: 108.7%) for AUC(0-infinity), 97.3% to 116.9% (point estimate: 106.7%) for AUC(0-t), and 92.5% to 113.0% (point estimate: 102.3%) for Cmax, and for hydrochlorothiazide 92.3% to 105.1% (point estimate: 98.5%) for AUC(0-infinity), 92.7% to 105.4% (point estimate: 98.9%) for AUC(0-t), and 97.6% to 115.3% (point estimate: 106.0%) for Cmax, within the acceptance criteria for bioequivalence (80%-125%).

    "662": "The introduction of selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has significantly improved the pharmacological treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, despite the undoubted advantages of antidepressant treatment in terms of improved tolerability to therapy while maintaining a high level of efficacy, not all patients benefit from it; an appreciable proportion do not respond adequately, while others may show adverse reactions. The necessary change of the initial treatment choice often requires extended periods for the remission of symptomatology. Such difficulties could be avoided if it should be possible to determine more quickly the most suitable drug. Several factors have been thought to influence the outcome of antidepressant therapy. Among the factors influencing the interindividual variability in response to treatment with SSRI, differences in genetic features may play a significant role. Several genetic polymorphisms have been associated with therapeutic SSRI response, including genetic variants of the 5-HT transporter, 5-HT-2A-receptor, tryptophan hydroxylase, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, G-protein beta3 subunit, interleukin-1beta and angiotensin-converting enzyme, although with conflicting results; also cytochrome P450 drug-metabolising enzymes may bear a particular importance, although further corroboration of the findings is necessary, and further key participating genes remain to be identified. The hope is that the identification of these genetic components will eventually facilitate the development of a customised SSRI treatment.",

In a framework of metabolic syndrome hypertension is characterized by disturbed circadian profile without nocturnal blood pressure lowering and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. There exist 2 mechanisms of linkage between hypertension and metabolic syndrome: impaired ion transport and neurohormonal and humoral activation. Antihypertensive drugs for correction of hypertension in metabolic syndrome should be long acting, provide protection of target organs, and induce positive or neutral metabolic effect. Together with normalization of blood pressure these actions can cause lowering of risk of atherosclerosis development. Representatives of the following classes of antihypertensive agents can be used as drugs of choice: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting calcium antagonists, selective beta1-adrenoblockers, and thiazide diuretics.",

For 8 weeks, all horses were treated with Accupro 20 (active substance: Quinapril) at an oral dose rate of 120 mg/horse/day. A follow-up of the horses with mitral valve insufficiency after 8 weeks revealed a statistically significant increase in the stroke volume and the cardiac output as well as a decrease in regurgitation velocity time integral (VTI). The regurgitation blood velocity remained the same. The severity of mitral valve insufficiencies revealed a moderate improvement in five horses, from moderate to mild, after therapy. Significant changes of cardiac dimension (B-mode) and shortening fraction (M-mode) before and after treatment could not be observed. The owners' judgement of the horses' performance was that of a minor improvement. In the horses without clinical findings the results of examination before and after treatment remained the same.",

    "696": "Uric acid (UA) is the final product of purine catabolism in man, and it is excreted mainly by the kidneys when renal function is not impaired. Consequently, serum (S) UA increases as a function of purine intake, and it varies inversely to uricosuria. The latter variable diminishes in response to low-sodium intakes and vice versa. Insofar as the diet is not usually controlled in studies in which the response of SUA to drugs is evaluated, most reports are to be considered cautiously. Common diuretics elevate SUA in healthy subjects, hypertensives and patients with heart failure, apparently by elevating net UA reabsorption in the nephronal proximal tubule. This drug action, which becomes noticeable shortly after the institution of treatment and remains throughout it, starts at low doses (e.g., 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 1.25 mg bendrofluazide once daily in subjects with uncomplicated hypertension) and increases in dose-dependent fashion. Beta-blockers tend to elevate SUA. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, enalapril and ramipril have been found to increase uricosuria mildly, likely by lowering the net reabsorption of UA in the proximal tubule. These three drugs and lisinopril can blunt the rise in SUA provoked by diuretics in hypertensives if used at sufficiently high doses relative to the dose of the diuretic. The angiotensin II antagonist losartan augments uricosuria mildly and thereby decreases SUA. The cardiovascular implications of the response of SUA to drugs remain speculative. Uric acid can scavenge various reactive oxygen species and thus reduce oxidative stress, which seems to contribute to the development and/or progress of various cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and heart failure. Consequently, it may be theorised that the elevations in SUA induced by diuretics might contribute to the established favourable action of these agents on cardiovascular prognosis. Conversely, diuretic-induced increases in SUA are to be considered detrimental according to an old hypothesis that maintains that SUA is a cardiovascular risk factor; this construct is largely based upon the results of selected epidemiological undertakings. The cardiovascular implications of the effects of drugs on SUA, if any, should be elucidated through purposive research.",

In the placebo-and chymase inhibitor-treated groups, the external jugular vein was infiltrated with saline and 10 microM TY-51184, respectively, and then it was grafted to the ipsilateral carotid artery. The non-surgical dogs were used as the control group. By 28 days after grafting, the chymase and ACE activities were significantly increased in the injured arteries. TY-51184 significantly reduced the chymase activity in the grafted veins, while it did not affect the ACE activity. The intimal areas in the placebo- and TY-51184-treated groups were 3.32 +/- 0.16 and 1.96 +/- 0.52 mm(2), respectively, and this difference was significant. The ratios of intimal area to medial area in the placebo- and TY-51184-treated groups were 66.8 +/- 3.5% and 34.9 +/- 9.2%, respectively, and this difference was also significant. There was a significant relationship between vascular proliferation and chymase activity, but not ACE activity.

We tested whether ACE inhibition could decrease the hematopoietic toxicity of lethal or sublethal irradiation protocols. In all cases, short treatment with the ACE inhibitor perindopril protected against irradiation-induced death. ACE inhibition accelerated hematopoietic recovery and led to a significant increase in platelet and red cell counts. Pretreatment with perindopril increased bone marrow cellularity and the number of hematopoietic progenitors (granulocyte macrophage colony-forming unit [CFU-GM], erythroid burst-forming unit [BFU-E], and megakaryocyte colony-forming unit [CFU-MK]) from day 7 to 28 after irradiation. Perindopril also increased the number of hematopoietic stem cells with at least a short-term reconstitutive activity in animals that recovered from irradiation. To determine the mechanism of action involved, we evaluated the effects of increasing AcSDKP plasma concentrations and of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (telmisartan) on radioprotection.

ESRD patients with diabetes have a particularly poor prognosis compared with patients without diabetes. The course of diabetic nephropathy can be modified with early management of the condition and it is important that diabetes patients are screened regularly for early signs of kidney damage. Blood pressure control and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Patients with diabetes are at considerable risk of cardiovascular complications, and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, such as anaemia and dyslipidaemia, should be treated at an early stage. Correction of anaemia with recombinant human erythropoietin is associated with improvements in quality of life, functional status, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and may slow the progression of renal disease. Abnormalities in calcium and phosphate metabolism and acidosis may also occur in patients with diabetes and nephropathy and these should be monitored regularly. It is important that patients with kidney disease are detected promptly to allow intervention to slow renal disease progression and to treat modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.

SHR with candesartan cilexetil showed a lower blood pressure, a lower percentage of CSM, smaller VSM area, with a higher RECA-1/media ratio, and a lower percentage of collagen type III, when compared to untreated SHR. In addition, SHR showed a positive correlation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and CSM amount (r=0.91; P<0.01), and SBP and the percentage of collagen type III (r=0.88; P<0.01); these correlations were not observed either in SHR treated with candesartan cilexetil or in WKY rats.

Hormone replacement therapy or vitamin supplementation has been identified as ineffective or mildly dangerous. Other measures have either not become established, or only poorly so.

Direct thrombin inhibitors, powerful antiplatelet agents, new fibrinolytic agents, and statins now allow far greater manipulation of the intraprocedural and postprocedural clot cascade and atherogenesis.

Of this number, 7755 patients contributed to information on mortality, 7262 to information on hospitalization for worsening heart failure, and 1096 to information on clinical status. Patients treated with digitalis compared with placebo had an odds ratio and confidence intervals for mortality of 0.98 (0.89, 1.09), for hospitalization of 0.68 (0.61, 0.75), and for a lesser degree of deterioration in clinical status of 0.31 (0.21, 0.43).",

    "748": "The role of anticoagulation in patients with chronic heart failure has long been an area of interest and controversy. Traditionally the goal of anticoagulation has been to prevent embolic events, but recent trials also demonstrated that oral anticoagulation also prevents vascular events in patients with prior myocardial infarction, who constitute the majority of heart failure patients. Although antiplatelet agents also reduce postinfarction vascular events, few data are available in heart failure patients, and some evidence suggests that aspirin may also have the potential to worsen heart failure morbidity and mortality, possibly by interfering with the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Methods and results The Warfarin and Antiplatelet Therapy in Chronic Heart Failure (WATCH) trial was undertaken to determine the optimal antithrombotic agent for heart failure patients. WATCH was a prospective-randomized trial in which symptomatic heart failure patients in sinus rhythm with ejection fractions < or =35% taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (unless not tolerated) and diuretics were randomized to open-label warfarin (target International Normalized Ratio 2.5-3.0) or double-blind antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 162 mg or clopidogrel 75 mg. Two primary comparisons were specified: anticoagulation with warfarin versus antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel versus antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. The primary outcome is the composite of death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke analyzed as time to first event using the intent-to-treat approach. The secondary endpoint was the broader composite of death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, and systemic or pulmonary artery embolic events.

Although kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are prone to experiencing cardiovascular outcomes, little is known about the epidemiology of anemia in this population. With few exceptions, studies to date have not fully evaluated the associations between posttransplant anemia (PTA) and medications commonly used in KTR, particularly immunosuppressant drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). The authors aimed to specifically investigate possible associations between these drugs and PTA. Detailed medical information was retrospectively collected on 374 consecutive KTR from our transplant clinic. Univariate/multivariate linear regression models were used to test for associations between hematocrit (HCT) and other covariates, and logistic regression models were used to detect independent predictors of PTA, defined as HCT <33%. The mean time since transplantation was 7.7 yr, and mean creatinine was 2.2 mg/dl. The prevalence of PTA was 28.6%. Ten percent of all patients were on erythropoietin therapy, but only 41.6% of patients whose HCT was <30 received this treatment. From multivariate analyses, the authors found that female gender and lower renal function were associated with lower HCT (both P < 0.001). Patients on ACEI had significantly lower HCT (P = 0.005) compared with patients without such treatment. In addition, a significant curvilinear dose-response relationship was found between ACEI dose and HCT. Among the immunosuppressant drugs, mycophenolate mofetil (P = 0.05) and tacrolimus (P = 0.02) were associated with a lower HCT. The authors conclude that PTA is prevalent and undertreated in KTR. Several medications that are possibly modifiable correlates of PTR deserve further study.", 
    "759": "Based on clinical and experimental studies, angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been proposed to exert acute anti-arrhythmic effects in heart failure patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess acute anti-arrhythmic effects of losartan and enalaprilat in hypertrophied rat hearts during low-flow ischaemia and reperfusion. In dose-finding experiments in non-hypertrophied isolated perfused hearts, we performed dose-response curves of losartan and enalaprilat studying monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarisation (MAPD(90%)) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold. Subsequently, we determined the effects of losartan and enalaprilat (in therapeutically relevant concentrations) on ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by low-flow ischaemia/reperfusion in hearts demonstrating left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy 70 days after aortic banding. We found that neither drug significantly affected MAPD(90%) (1 nM-1 mM) or VF threshold (1 microM losartan and 10 microM enalaprilat) in non-hypertrophied hearts. Similarly in hypertrophied hearts, neither drug significantly affected the incidence or the duration of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and VF) during low-flow ischaemia. However, 1 microM losartan significantly reduced the duration of ventricular tachyarrhythmias during reperfusion. In conclusion, neither losartan nor enalaprilat is acutely anti-arrhythmic in hypertrophied rat hearts during low-flow ischaemia. During reperfusion, however, losartan but not enalaprilat exerts acute anti-arrhythmic effects.",

Pro-TRH gene expression was induced in cardiac interstitial cells after MI, and this effect was restricted to the heart, because no increase in TRH mRNA abundance was observed in the hypothalamus, kidney, or lung. Transcript abundance of pro-TRH can be increased in cultured cardiac fibroblasts by several adrenergic agonists, indicating that the adrenergic axis may play a regulatory role in cardiac TRH production. Acute intravenous administration of TRH to rats with ischemic cardiomyopathy caused a significant increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac contractility.",

IC, the most common symptom, is experienced by 2% to 3% of men and 1% to 2% of women aged 60 years and older. Despite its recognition as a major atherothrombotic risk factor, PAD is not widely appreciated by clinicians, and most cases remain undiagnosed. Asymptomatic PAD, as indicated by a reduced ankle brachial systolic pressure index, should alert the health care provider to the presence of diffuse atherothrombotic disease and need for treatment. Risk factors for development and progression of PAD include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and physical inactivity. The aim of pharmacotherapy is to improve the symptoms of PAD (especially IC), defer onset of limb-threatening ischemia, and improve long-term survival. Successful treatment strategies include risk factor modification, particularly smoking cessation; initiation of regular exercise; control of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia; and use of antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk of atherothrombotic events. Available data suggest that aspirin reduces morbidity and mortality in PAD, while clopidogrel reduces the risk of atherothrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke in these patients.",

Atherothrombosis rather than arterial stenosis appears to account for most of the acute ischemic manifestations of the atherosclerotic process. Interventions that can favorably influence atherosclerotic progression include lifestyle modifications (dietary control, exercise, and smoking cessation) and pharmacotherapy (lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, antiglycemic, and antiplatelet drugs).

Despite advances in the understanding of the pathomechanisms of cardiotoxicity, in prevention and detection of these complications, progressive ventricular dysfunction in cancer survivors represents a great therapeutic problem. Ventricular dysfunction is a life-threatening complication particularly in patients treated with anthracycline cytostatics. Anthracycline-induced loss of myocytes leads to an inadequate ventricular hypertrophy, which produces a rise in left ventricular (LV) afterload and deterioration of ventricular contractility culminating in heart failure. Efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the treatment of asymptomatic and symptomatic LV dysfunction in various clinical settings has been confirmed in a number of controlled, randomized trials. Until now, there are only few published data supporting the use of ACE inhibitors to treat patients with ventricular dysfunction-induced by anthracyclines. Cardio-protection with ACE inhibitors in children and adolescents treated with anthracyclines in contrast to ACE inhibition in adults after anthracycline therapy is a controversial topic. Evidence from the recent follow up study indicates a progressive deterioration of left ventricular wall thinning in childhood cancer survivors treated with enalapril. The ongoing large controlled, double blind, randomized trials will provide an important information concerning the efficacy of ACE inhibitors to prevent progression of ventricular dysfunction in paediatric oncologic patients.",

The mRNA levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were not associated with any known clinicopathological tumour feature. TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 levels were significantly higher in steroid hormone receptor-positive samples, although the levels of TIMP-4 were much lower than those of the other TIMPs. Only TIMP-3 predicted relapse-free survival (RFS) time differently depending on post-surgical treatment as, in particular, the interaction of TIMP-3 with endocrine therapy (p = 0.008, HR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.09-0.69) contributed significantly to RFS in multivariate Cox regression analysis. In subgroup analyses, the 107 patients treated with tamoxifen differed greatly in prognosis after dichotomization by the median TIMP-3 level (p = 0.0003).

    "783": "Two decades of research from CONSENSUS to CHARM using modulators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients have shown convincing clinical benefits, but the majority of clinicians prescribing these drugs are still unclear about what mechanisms are responsible for the observed benefits. Of the candidate mechanisms hitherto proposed, there emerges a theme that best fits the spectrum of known factors from pathophysiology of heart failure to how the drugs enhance longevity of patients. This concept can be summarised as follows: after the onset of heart failure, neurohormones are activated resulting in raised levels of angiotensin, aldosterone and catecholamines, which are all known cardiotoxic agents. Cumulatively over time, they are responsible for accelerated cardiomyocyte attrition, manifesting as a faster reduction of cardiac pumping reserve, leading to worsening heart failure, more neurohormonal activation, thus propagating a vicious cycle spiralling towards an earlier fatality. The vicious cycle can be interrupted by dampening the excessive neurohormonal activities, thereby minimising cardiomyocyte losses and preserving cardiac functional reserve for longer. This culminates in maintenance of a reasonable quality of life and enhanced longevity. Such a mechanistic understanding would enable clinicians to have a better perspective on how to apply data from various clinical trials involving these drugs into clinical practice, to optimise and tailor therapy to the individual patient so that each patient can gain maximal benefits.",

In light of this hypothesis, we evaluated the cerebroprotective effects of various drug classes in recent double-blinded, prospective, randomized trials, such as SHEP, PATS, CAPPP, HOPE, PROGRESS, INSIGHT, NORDIL, LIFE, SCOPE, ANBP2, and ALLHAT. Drugs that activate the AT2 receptors, such as diuretics, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), were consistently more beneficial for stroke reduction than drugs devoid of such activation, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, despite an equal fall in arterial pressure (at least in patients with a low incidence of cardiac complications). These clinical and epidemiologic observations are supported by experimental data documenting greater cerebroprotection with ARBs (which increase angiotensin II levels and stimulate the AT2 receptors) than with ACE inhibitors. Stroke is the most devastating consequence of hypertensive cardiovascular disease, and our hypothesis of cerebroprotection by AT2 receptor activation should be tested by a head-to-head comparison of an ARB with an ACE inhibitor.",

Myocardial infiltration by eosinophils ranged from mild (n = 6), often focal involvement to marked (n = 8), usually multifocal or widespread involvement. Twelve patients (86%) had peripheral blood eosinophilia before transplant, and in ten (71%), the eosinophil count at least doubled. Loop or thiazide diuretics were used in all 14 patients, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used in 12. Preoperative characteristics were similar in patients with and without EM, except for a higher frequency of inotropic support and assist devices in EM patients. Dobutamine was used in 12 (86%) and dopamine in seven (50%; one with dopamine alone), and one patient (7%) received neither dopamine nor dobutamine. In two patients receiving dobutamine and one receiving dopamine, tapering or discontinuation of the inotropic infusion resulted in a significant diminution of the peripheral eosinophilia and the EM before transplantation. Postoperative survival in patients with and without EM was similar at 8 yrs (50% +/- 13% and 54% +/- 4%, p =.34). No patient in this study has had EM on biopsy after transplant.",

EM may be related to intravenous inotropic therapy, and this is the first study to document improvement in myocardial pathology after inotropic drug withdrawal. Hypersensitivity to thiazide and loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antibiotics must also be considered. Survival after heart transplantation is not impaired, and postoperative steroid therapy may prevent EM.",

    "804": "A large number of studies have demonstrated the role of angiotensin II in cardiac preconditioning against ischemic reperfusion injury. Generally, angiotensin II is a detrimental factor for the heart, and its inhibition with an ACE inhibitor provides cardioprotection. This review provides an explanation for such paradoxical behavior of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II can potentiate the induction of the expression of a variety of redox-sensitive factors including p38 MAPK, JNK and Akt, IGF-IR, EGF-R, and HO-1 as well as redox-regulated genes and transcription factors such as NFkappaB. It becomes increasingly apparent that during the earlier phase, the heart attempts to adapt itself against the detrimental effects of angiotensin II by upregulating several cardioprotective genes and proteins. These genes and proteins are redox-regulated and the antioxidants or ROS scavengers block their expressions. Interestingly, an identical pattern of cardioprotective proteins and genes are expressed in the preconditioned heart, which are also inhibited with ROS scavengers. It is tempting to speculate that the induction of the expression of the redox-sensitive cardioprotective proteins is the results of adaptation of the heart against the oxidative stress resulting from angiotensin II; and preconditioning is the net result of harnessing its own protection during ischemic and/or oxidative stress through its ability to trigger redox signaling.",

This paper aims the quantification of renal cortical components involved in blood pressure regulation under NOs blockade. Spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) are submitted to chronic blockade of NOs by L-nitro-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) and an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in comparison with the normotensive Wistar rats. Twenty SHRs and 5 Wistar rats were divided in 5 groups and observed for 21 days for blood pressure (BP) and serum creatinine: control Wistar (5) (C-W), control SHR (5) (C-SHR), L-SHR (5)--received L-NAME 30 mg/kg/day, L+E-SHR (5)--received L-NAME and Enalapril maleate 15 mg/kg/day, E-SHR (5)--received Enalapril maleate. A quantitative morphometric study (glomerular density, QA[gl], interstitium volume density, Vv[i], tubular surface and length densities, Sv[t] and Lv[t]) were performed at the end. The BP reached 226+/-15 mmHg in L-SHR group. The BP difference between the L-SHR and the C-SHR groups was significant from the first week while the E-SHR group became significant from the second week. At the end of the experiment the BP of the E-SHR group was similar to the BP in the C-W group. The QA[gl] was similar among C-SHR, L-SHR and L+E-SHR groups and no difference was found between E-SHR and C-W groups. In the L-SHRs serum creatinine was greatly increased, and microscopy showed thickening of arteriolar tunica media with an increase of the wall-to-lumen ratio, perivascular fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrated, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The use of enalapril was not completely efficient in reducing BP and morphological injury when the hypertension of SHRs was increased with the NOs blockade suggesting that NO deficiency-induced hypertension is not entirely mediated by the RAAS.",

Failed furosemide adherence (defined as < 10% of a dose excreted in 24 h urine where normal average excretion = 50% of an oral dose) during static prescribed dosing was infrequent relative to all days of therapy; yet was equally common across all outcome groups. Furosemide non-adherence appeared to be independent of non-adherence with ACE inhibitor (as marked by serum ACE activity > 20 U l(-1)) treatment. Furosemide responsiveness (mm of sodium excreted per mg furosemide in urine) showed no relationship to prescribed dose and paradoxically tended to rise in patients with higher basal aldosterone concentrations. Furosemide responsiveness fell by outcome class despite increased dose. Within-patient responsiveness remained relatively constant although highly variable between individuals.",

Non-adherence with furosemide was less common among those who died and appeared to occur at different time points from non-adherence with ACE inhibitor treatment, which was slightly more common in all outcome groups. Patients who died were prescribed higher furosemide doses and had greater furosemide excretion yet had similar sodium excretion. The main factor in response to chronic furosemide therapy was intrarenal diuretic resistance. Gross non-adherence was less important.",

In addition, the influence of these anti-irritants on the penetration capacity of captopril through the rabbit skin was also investigated. The results showed that the TEWL, change chroma (delta C), and difference in color (delta E) of skin were significantly reduced via incorporating diphenhydramine and clobetasol, indicating that both substances had potent irritation inhibition activity. Moreover, these substances had no effect on the percutaneous absorption of captopril gel. However, flux of the captopril with anti-irritants was about 480 microg/cm2/h and the required minimum administration area to obtain the minimum effective concentration was about 15 cm2, indicating that this formulation could possibly be developed for a transdermal drug delivery system.",

Initial assessment should include ruling out factors which may exacerbate the hypertension and careful assessment of the stage of hypertension, renal function and amount of proteinuria. Intensive treatment requires finding a combination of medications which will reduce not only blood pressure but also proteinuria. It is suggested that treatment should be started with an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor blocker often in a fixed combination with a low-dose thiazide diuretic. Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers may be added if required as second or third-line agents. In patients not responding to this combination, the dosages of the ACE inhibitor or AT1 blocker should be titrated upwards in order to obtain the maximal therapeutic effect. However, if this is still insufficient, dual blockade of the RAS should be considered and even an aldosterone receptor blocker may need to be added to the therapeutic regimen. It should be remembered that such a patient requires close monitoring in order to be sure that he is compliant with respect to the prescribed treatment and that there are no side-effects such as hyperkalaemia.",

Cells were obtained by enzymatic dispersion of hearts from control male and female rats and from rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (100 mg/kg) 7-14 days before experiments. ANG II content, measured by ELISA, was augmented in diabetic males but unaltered in diabetic females. In diabetic ovariectomized females, ANG II levels were augmented as in males. ANG II affects multiple cellular pathways including activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and several tyrosine kinases as well as inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA). The involvement of these pathways in modulating outward K(+) currents was studied. Transient and sustained outward K(+) currents were measured using the whole cell voltage-clamp method. In males, these currents are attenuated under diabetic conditions but are augmented by the ANG II-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril. Activation of PKA by 8-bromo-cAMP enhanced both K(+) currents in cells from diabetic males. The augmentation of these currents by quinapril was blocked when PKA inhibition was maintained with the Rp isomer of 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases by genistein also augmented K(+) currents in cells from diabetic males. Action potentials were abbreviated by 8-bromo-cAMP and genistein. However, both genistein and 8-bromo-cAMP had no effect on K(+) currents in cells from diabetic females. In cells from ovariectomized diabetic females, 8-bromo-cAMP and genistein enhanced these K(+) currents as in males. Inhibition of PKC augmented the transient and sustained K(+) currents in cells from diabetic males and females. A contribution of non-ANG II-dependent activation of PKC is suggested. These results describe some of the mechanisms that may underlie gender-specific differences in the development of cardiac disease and arrhythmias.",

This study assessed the effect of manidipine on normal subjects' monocyte gene and protein expression of OxSt-related proteins such as p22(phox), a NAD(P)H oxidase system subunit, critical in generating O2-, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), induced by and protective from OxSt, and compared manidipine with the ACE inhibitor captopril and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, in the presence and absence of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) as an inducer of OxSt.Co-incubation of manidipine with NaAsO2 dose-dependently decreased p22(phox) mRNA production from basal: 0.87 +/- 0.1 d.u., 0.69 +/- 0.06 and 0.66 +/- 0.09 at 100, 300 and 500 nM respectively versus 0.99 +/- 0.2, P < 0.04, while HO-1 mRNA production was increased by the same concentrations of the drug: 0.87 +/- 0.1 d.u., 0.92 +/- 0.1, 0.98 +/- 0.1 respectively versus 0.63 +/- 0.07; P < 0.03. Monocyte p22(phox) mRNA production was reduced both by manidipine and captopril: 0.48 +/- 0.04 d.u. and 0.43 +/- 0.08, respectively versus 0.58 +/- 0.07, P < 0.006, while no changes were induced by nifedipine (0.61 +/- 0.07, P = ns). Manidipine increased monocyte HO-1 mRNA production (1.6 +/- 0.4 versus 1.2 +/- 0.4, P < 0.008), while nifedipine and captopril showed no effect (1.2 +/- 0.3 and 1.1 +/- 0.3, respectively). The effects of M on p22(phox) and HO-1 gene expression in the presence of OxSt were also paralleled by the same effects at protein level. In conclusion, manidipine decreases p22(phox) and increases HO-1 mRNA production and protein level. The manidipine-induced increase of HO-1 gene and protein expression seems to be a peculiar effect of this drug since it is not observed with captopril and nifedipine. This effect, together with the reduction of p22(phox) mRNA production, could play a role in its protective mechanism against OxSt.", 
    "858": "Our aim was to compare the distribution and determinants of heart rate variability (HRV) measures in a middle-aged population with patients of the same sex and age after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and to show, whether HRV values defined as abnormal from the general population are indicative for a worse prognosis even in AMI patients.", 
    "859": "HRV was studied in a random sample of 149 middle-aged men and 137 women from the general population (45-65 years) as well as 129 consecutive AMI patients (25-74 years). Spectral analysis was used to compute low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and total frequency power. To the AMI population of age 45-65 years (N = 85) a sample out of the general population was matched by age and sex by 2:1 matching (N = 149). All AMI patients were followed for a median of 43 months (range 1-47) for death or malignant arrhythmia.", 
    "860": "All measures of HRV were significantly and substantially lower in AMI patients than the general population (P < 0.001). Expression in relative terms revealed that the proportionate contributions of HF and LF to total power were significantly different in the two populations with relatively lower LF power in AMI patients (P < 0.01). The negative correlation with heart rate and HRV measures was significantly more pronounced in AMI patients (P < 0.01). The 2.5th percentile of the LF power distribution in the general population (3.08 ln ms2) corresponds to the 25th percentile in the AMI population. Subjects of the whole AMI population with values below this LF cutpoint revealed a significant increased risk of death or malignant arrhythmia during follow-up (odds ratio 5.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.3; 23).", 
    "861": "AMI patients had strongly diminished HRV compared to the general population. The relatively lower LF power indicates an alteration of the sympathico-vagal balance, and the significantly stronger correlation of heart rate with HRV may be indicative for a more pronounced effect of sympathetic activation on autonomic modulation in the case of myocardial infarction. Finally, a value below the 2.5th percentile of the population LF power distribution may identify subjects at risk and warrant further testing.", 
    "862": "Despite advanced techniques of renal replacement therapy the overall mortality of patients with ARF is still high. The majority of patients with ARF requiring dialysis are those with nontraumatic ARF. In a retrospective study we compared the causes of nontraumatic ARF, the risk factors for the development of renal failure and the mortality rates in patients with and without diabetes mellitus who received dialysis therapy in the years 1991-2000. A total of 232 patients were included in the study, 34 (14.6%) of them with and 198 patients (85.4%) without diabetes. The predominant causes of nontraumatic ARF like congestive heart failure (26.4 vs. 13.6, p < 0.05) and hypotension/hypovolemia (20.6 vs. 7.6%, p < 0.05) occurred more frequently in diabetic patients. The prevalence of sepsis (8.8 vs. 10.1%, NS), malignancy/ hypercalcemia (5.8 vs. 11.6%, NS) and other causes of nontraumatic ARF were similar in both groups. The prevalence of hepato-renal syndrome (5.8 vs. 13.6%, p < 0.05) and acute kidney graft failure (2.9 vs. 15.1%, p < 0.05) was higher in the nondiabetic individuals. Patients with diabetes showed more often chronic predictors for the onset of ARF like pre-existing hypertension (93.6 vs. 51.0%, p < 0.05), congestive heart failure (44.1 vs. 14.6%, p < 0.005), pre-existing renal insufficiency (76.4 vs. 46.9%, p < 0.05) and ACE-inhibitor therapy (32.3 vs. 9.6%, p < 0.005). Additionally, the prevalence of multiple organ failure (MOF) as prognostic factor was significantly higher in the diabetic patients (47.0 vs. 21.7%, p < 0.05). The mean number of dialyses therapy was 4.7 vs. 4.5 per patient. The overall mortality was 41.1 vs. 44.% (NS). In conclusion, the prevalence of the most common causes of nontraumatic ARF was different between the patients with and without diabetes. The diabetic individuals had more frequently predictors for the onset of ARF. The overall mortality was approximately the same in both groups.",

Diabetes increased the risk of recurrent stroke by 35% (95% CI 10-65%) principally through an effect on ischaemic stroke (1.53, 95% CI 1.23-1.90). Active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9.5/4.6 mmHg in patients with diabetes and by 8.9/3.9 mmHg in patients without diabetes. The proportional risk reductions achieved for stroke in patients with diabetes, 38% (95% CI 8-58%), and patients without diabetes, 28% (95% CI 16-39%), were not significantly different (p homogeneity = 0.5).

    "866": "A new Dutch clinical practice guideline has been developed for the diagnosis, treatment and supportive care of patients with chronic heart failure. This has been formulated by a multidisciplinary working group, set up by the Netherlands Heart Foundation and the Netherlands Society of Cardiology, in cooperation with the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Heart failure is defined as: 'a complex of complaints and symptoms resulting from an inadequate pumping function of the heart'. Indications for heart failure are dyspnoea on exertion, reduced exertion tolerance and oedema. By using data from the medical history, case history, physical examination and simple additional tests (laboratory tests, ECG, chest X-ray photos) it is possible to demonstrate or exclude heart failure in clear-cut cases. Doppler ultrasonography should be performed in all patients where heart failure is suspected but cannot be clearly demonstrated. The initial treatment for patients with heart failure with reduced systolic LV function generally consists of the administration of a thiazide or loop diuretic together with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker, to which digoxin and/or spironolactone may be added. For very old patients extra attention should be given to the comorbidity and the medication and dosing scheme should be as simple as possible. The worse the cardiac function, the more the salt and fluid intake should be limited and the more strictly the weight should be monitored.", 
    "867": "The aim of the present study was to compare the influence of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic system in the process of post-haemorrhagic vasopressin release. A dialysis of the venous blood from the sella turcica region was performed in male rats under anaesthesia. The animals were divided into eight experimental groups: 1). control; 2). bleeding; 3). 20 days after superior cervical ganglionectomy; 4). 20 days after superior cervical ganglionectomy and bleeding; 5). injection of captopril; 6). injection of captopril and bleeding; 7). 20 days after superior cervical ganglionectomy and injection of captopril; 8). 20 days after superior cervical ganglionectomy, injection of captopril and bleeding. The content of vasopressin in dialysates was determined by radioimmunoassay. In control rats the release of vasopressin into dialysates was constant during 180 min of the experiment. Bleeding, as well as, superior cervical ganglionectomy caused an increase in vasopressin release. Captopril did not change vasopressin release in comparison to control group. Furthermore, vasopressin release after both, bleeding and sympathetic denervation performed simultaneously was significantly abolished. We conclude that renin-angiotensin, as well as, sympathetic nervous system are involved in the increased post-haemorrhagic vasopressin release.", 
    "868": "The study was undertaken to examine the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the reversal by endogenous central histamine of critical haemorrhagic hypotension in anaesthetised Wistar rats. Histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor metoprine (20 microg) administered intracerebroventricularly at 5 min of critical hypotension 20-25 mmHg produced increases in histamine concentrations as measured 20 min after treatment in the hypothalamus (581.33 +/- 63.23 vs. 488.26 +/- 56.34 ng/g of wet tissue; P < 0.01) and medulla oblongata (53.42 +/- 14.65 vs. 34.68 +/- 13.52 ng/g of wet tissue; P < 0.05). That was accompanied by 34.7% higher plasma angiotensin II concentration in comparison to the control group. Metoprine produced dose-dependent (5-20 microg) rises in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate, which were significantly higher than those in normotensive animals. The resuscitating action of metoprine (20 microg) was associated with rises in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters blood flows, and a 100% survival at 2 h after treatment, while in the saline-treated group, all the animals died within 30 min. Angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist ZD 7155 (0.5 mg/kg; iv) decreased regional vascular resistance and inhibited metoprine-induced increase in MAP, whereas AT(2) receptor blocker PD 123319 (10 mg/kg; i.v.) had no effect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (30 mg/kg; i.v.) reduced the increase in plasma angiotensin II level and the haemodynamic effects of metoprine. Neither capropril, nor angiotensin receptor antagonists influence the survival at 2 h after treatment. In conclusion, the renin-angiotensin system is involved in central histamine-induced resuscitating action in rats.",

Approximately 2% of cases of acute pancreatitis may be caused by drugs, but it is not a known complication of metformin therapy. To date only one case of pancreatitis has been reported in association with metformin, but that was secondary to metformin poisoning (overdose). This is the first reported case of pancreatitis caused by a therapeutic dose of metformin (although in this case renal failure precipitated the metformin toxicity).

Postoperative atrial fibrillation was associated with subsequent greater resource use as well as with cognitive changes, renal dysfunction, and infection. Among patients in the derivation cohort, risk factors associated with atrial fibrillation were advanced age (odds ratio [OR] for 10-year increase, 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-1.93); history of atrial fibrillation (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.57-2.85) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87); valve surgery (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.32); and postoperative withdrawal of a beta-blocker (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.52-2.40) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (OR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.38-2.08). Conversely, reduced risk was associated with postoperative administration of beta-blockers (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22-0.46), ACE inhibitors (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.79), potassium supplementation (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.68), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.40-0.60). The resulting multivariable risk index had adequate discriminative power with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77 in the validation sample. Forty-three percent (640/1503) of patients who had atrial fibrillation after CABG surgery experienced more than 1 episode of atrial fibrillation. Predictors of recurrent atrial fibrillation included older age, history of congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic atherosclerosis, bicaval venous cannulation, withdrawal of ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker therapy, and use of amiodarone or digoxin (area under the ROC curve of 0.66). Patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation had longer hospital stays and experienced greater infectious, renal, and neurological complications than those with a single episode.",

After 6 months, patients whose diastolic blood pressure (BP) was <90 mm Hg had their dosages down-titrated were followed for an additional 6 months. Diastolic BP was the primary end point. Eplerenone was as effective as enalapril in reducing both systolic BP (eplerenone, -14.5 mm Hg; enalapril, -12.7 mm Hg; p = 0.199) and diastolic BP (eplerenone, -11.2 mm Hg; enalapril, -11.3 mm Hg; p = 0.910) at 6 months. BP reductions at 12 months were also similar between groups (-16.5/-13.3 mm Hg for eplerenone, -14.8/-14.1 mm Hg for enalapril; p = 0.251 and 0.331, respectively). Withdrawal rates for adverse events (eplerenone 7.9%, enalapril 9.3% at 6 months) and treatment failures (eplerenone 23.3%, enalapril 22.8% at 6 months) were also equivalent. Approximately 2/3 of each group had normal BP with monotherapy treatment at 6 months. BP response was independent of renin levels in the eplerenone group, but not in the enalapril group. Both agents reduced albuminuria in patients who had an elevated value at baseline, with significantly greater improvement in patients treated with eplerenone versus enalapril (-61.5% vs -25.7%; p = 0.01). Both agents were similarly well tolerated, and there was no increased incidence of any sexual adverse events in the eplerenone group. Patients taking enalapril had a higher rate of cough. Both agents increased serum potassium levels, but <1% in each group reported adverse events from hyperkalemia. Eplerenone was as effective as enalapril as monotherapy in patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension, was more effective in reducing albuminuria, and was well tolerated for 12 months.",

The half-inhibition concentrations, IC(50), of scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were 36 and 48 microM and against superoxide radicals were 18.99 and 6.33 mM, respectively, for AAH and GAH. However, no activities of asparagine and glutamine were found. AAH and GAH also exhibited activities against peroxynitrite-mediated dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidations and hydroxyl radical-mediated DNA damage. For ACE inhibitory activities, the IC(50) values were 4.92 and 6.56 mM, respectively, for AAH and GAH. The ACE hydrolyzed products on the TLC chromatogram also confirmed the inhibitory activities of the two amino acid hydroxamates on ACE. When 1.23 mM AAH was added, AAH showed competitive inhibitions against ACE, and the apparent inhibition constant (K(i)) was 2.20 mM.",

Both digests of leaf protein have antihypertensive effects after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with minimum effective doses of 0.25 and 0.5 g/kg, respectively. The maximum antihypertensive effect for the pepsin digest was observed 4 h after oral administration, while for the pepsin-pancreatin digest, the maximum effect was observed 2 h after oral administration. Undigested spinach leaf protein did not exert any significant antihypertensive effect after oral administration to SHR at doses of 0.5 and 1 g/kg.

After enalapril or clonidine treatment, leptin levels were not modified. Both drugs significantly diminished the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In the obese group, clonidine and enalapril diminished the LF/HFn ratio (p < 0.05). The LF/HF index showed a univariate correlation with body mass index, leptin, systolic blood pressure, insulin, age and triglyceride levels.

In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), blood pressure, heart weight and ACE activities in plasma and various tissues were measured 3, 24 and 48 h after repeated daily treatment for 2 weeks with the ACE inhibitors trandolapril, perindopril, temocapril and enalapril. For all four ACE inhibitors, blood pressure and ACE activities in the plasma, aorta and kidney were significantly reduced 3 h after the last treatment. Although hypotensive effects were maintained at 24 h, ACE activities in plasma were not suppressed by temocapril and enalapril. Even at 3 h, enalapril could not suppress ACE activity in the brain, and temocapril and enalapril could not inhibit ACE activities in the heart. Significant correlations between ACE activity in the aorta and blood pressure were observed for all four ACE inhibitors, while the ACE activities in the heart and brain were not correlated with changes in blood pressure. Significant decreases in the ratio of heart weight to body weight were observed in SHR treated with trandolapril and perindopril, whereas they were not observed with temocapril and enalapril. The ratio of heart weight to body weight was significantly correlated with ACE activity in the heart. ACE activities in vascular tissues and the heart may be important targets in terms of the ability of ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure or inhibit cardiac hypertrophy, respectively.",

The study used a prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) design. Patients were enrolled at 354 Japanese hospitals specializing in cardiovascular disease. The subjects were 1,650 outpatients aged under 75 years who had diagnoses of both hypertension and coronary artery disease. There were 828 patients subjected to intention-to-treat analysis in the nifedipine retard group and 822 patients in the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor group. The patients were randomized to 3 years of treatment with either nifedipine retard or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The primary endpoint was the overall incidence of cardiac events (cardiac death or sudden death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for angina pectoris or heart failure, serious arrhythmia, and coronary interventions). The primary endpoint occurred in 116 patients (14.0%) from the nifedipine retard group and 106 patients (12.9%) from the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor group (relative risk, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.37; p = 0.75). In the Kaplan-Meier estimates, there were no significant differences between the two groups (log-rank test: p = 0.86).

A total of 667 patients were randomized to receive the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with or without the diuretic indapamide (2 mg daily) or matching placebo(s). Brain CT scanning was performed annually over the mean follow-up period of 3.9 years. Active treatment reduced the blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) by 5.2/2.6 mmHg over the follow-up period. A total of 119 new SBI were detected and 92% of them were lacunar type small infarcts. The frequency of reaching the primary end-point (recurrent symptomatic stroke or new SBI) was similar in the placebo group (26.5%) and in the active treatment group (25.9%). There was no significant difference in brain atrophy indices between two groups. In the subgroup with a history of large artery infarction, 7 out of 55 patients from the placebo group developed new SBI, while none of the 40 patients from the active treatment group did so (p = 0.020). The baseline diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with the risk of new SBI (p = 0.004), but the stroke subtype was not. In conclusion, blood pressure-lowering with a perindopril-based regimen did not increase the risk of SBI and brain atrophy in patients with a history of stroke. The baseline diastolic blood pressure was an independent predictor of new SBI, but the index stroke subtype did not influence the risk of SBI.",

In the HOPE trial performed in a high risk population the preventive antiatherosclerotic, endothel-preserving effects of ramipril resulted in a significant mortality and morbidity reduction. In the EUROPA trial a lower risk population--symptomfree coronary patients--were treated by perindopril, and it was proven also in this cohort, that the long term ACE inhibitor treatment decreased the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden death.

Both Hispanics (13% vs 11%) and non-Hispanic whites (28% vs 9%), however, had declines in hospital case-fatality rates between 1975 and 1999. An overall similar treatment pattern and increasing trends in the use of effective cardiac medications over time were observed in both patient groups. However, Hispanics were significantly less likely to be treated with coronary angioplasty during the acute hospitalization. Trends of a worse long-term survival for discharged Hispanic patients were observed over a 10-year follow-up period.",

    "903": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an integral role in blood pressure regulation and has long been a target of pharmacologic approaches to controlling blood pressure. Traditionally, clinical interventions involving the RAAS have focused mainly on inhibiting the action of angiotensin II with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and limited attention has been devoted to direct inhibition of the action of aldosterone. Recent advances in understanding the role of aldosterone in cardiovascular injury have elevated the importance of direct inhibition of the action of this hormone in the long-term control of blood pressure and have led to the development of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone. This article reviews the role of the RAAS in the development of hypertension and discusses the rationale for the use of eplerenone with other medications affecting the RAAS to control blood pressure.", 
    "904": "Hypertension (HTN), one of the most common medical disorders, is associated with an increased incidence of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Lifestyle modifications are advocated for the prevention, treatment, and control of HTN, with exercise being an integral component. Exercise programs that primarily involve endurance activities prevent the development of HTN and lower blood pressure (BP) in adults with normal BP and those with HTN. The BP lowering effects of exercise are most pronounced in people with HTN who engage in endurance exercise with BP decreasing approximately 5-7 mm HG after an isolated exercise session (acute) or following exercise training (chronic). Moreover, BP is reduced for up to 22 h after an endurance exercise bout (e.g.postexercise hypotension), with greatest decreases among those with highest baseline BP. The proposed mechanisms for the BP lowering effects of exercise include neurohumoral, vascular, and structural adaptations. Decreases in catecholamines and total peripheral resistance, improved insulin sensitivity, and alterations in vasodilators and vasoconstrictors are some of the postulated explanations for the antihypertensive effects of exercise. Emerging data suggest genetic links to the BP reductions associated with acute and chronic exercise. Nonetheless, definitive conclusions regarding the mechanisms for the BP reductions following endurance exercise cannot be made at this time. Individuals with controlled HTN and no CVD or renal complications may participated in an exercise program or competitive athletics, but should be evaluated, treated and monitored closely. Preliminary peak or symptom-limited exercise testing may be warranted, especially for men over 45 and women over 55 yr planning a vigorous exercise program (i.e. > or = 60% VO2R, oxygen uptake reserve). In the interim, while formal evaluation and management are taking place, it is reasonable for the majority of patients to begin moderate intensity exercise (40-<60% VO2R) such as walking. When pharmacological therapy is indicated in physically active people it should be, ideally: a) lower BP at rest and during exertion; b) decrease total peripheral resistance; and, c) not adversely affect exercise capacity. For these reasons, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers in case of ACE inhibitor intolerance) and calcium channel blockers are currently the drugs of choice for recreational exercisers and athletes who have HTN. Exercise remains a cornerstone therapy for the primary prevention, treatment, and control of HTN. The optimal training frequency, intensity, time, and type (FITT) need to be better defined to optimize the BP lowering capacities of exercise, particularly in children, women, older adults, and certain ethnic groups. based upon the current evidence, the following exercise prescription is recommended for those with high BP: Frequency: on most, preferably all, days of the week. Intensity: moderate-intensity (40-<60% VO2R). Time: > or = 30 min of continuous or accumulated physical activity per day. Type: primarily endurance physical activity supplemented by resistance exercise.", 
    "905": "Since the proportion of subjects taking antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs is currently increasing in industrialized countries, it is important to evaluate, at the population level, coronary risk of treated individuals, while taking into account the achieved level of their risk factors (i.e. their 'residual coronary risk').",

Subgroup analysis showed that these results applied to beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists, but not to diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, to both angina pectoris and hard coronary event risk, but in the French population only and not in Belfast.

Compared with untreated rats, GFR was reduced to a lesser extent by omapatrilat than enalapril (694 +/- 93 and 364 +/- 40 versus 848 +/- 43 microl/min per g kidney weight). Hoe140 had no influence on GFR in omapatrilat-treated animals but attenuated the reduction of GFR in enalapril-treated rats (662 +/- 22 and 543 +/- 62 microl/min per g kidney weight).

In addition, because of the huge release of renin, angiotensinogen concentrations were reduced, leading to a decrease in intrarenal angiotensins. In rats fed the high-sodium diet, those treated with the enalapril 30 mg/kg plus losartan 30 mg/kg combination, despite complete functional RAS blockade, exhibited smaller decreases in blood pressure and renal resistance, lesser release of renin and angiotensinogen consumption, and a normal renal function.

Combining candesartan-cilexetil with ramipril increased SBP reduction synergistically rather than additively, since the dose-response curve was shifted 6.6-fold leftwards compared to a hypothetically generated additive curve, calculated by summing up the doses and corresponding effects of the ramipril and candesartan-cilexetil monotreatment regimes. A total threshold dose < 5.14 mg/kg (derived from dose-response curves) was found to exert synergistic effects when candesartan-cilexetil was combined with ramipril. Antihypertensive effects of mibefradil can not be increased when combined with candesartan-cilexetil. When LVW was correlated with SBP reduction, regression lines of candesartan-cilexetil, ramipril and their combination were congruent, while that for mibefradil was significantly flatter and became steeper under candesartan-cilexetil co-administration. Cardiac ACE activity was greatly reduced by ramipril independently of SBP reduction and dosage. With SBP-ineffective doses of ramipril, cardiac ACE mRNA levels were doubled, indicating a positive feedback mechanism. The increase in ACE mRNA was renormalized when SPB-effective ramipril doses were applied, suggesting a blood pressure-dependent regulation of cardiac ACE expression.",

The conflicting data provided by the main HOPE study and by the HOPE-ABP monitoring substudy on the role of blood pressure reduction in explaining the reduced event rates associated with treatment by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are a clear example of the importance of performing ABP monitoring in trials on cardiovascular protection."
