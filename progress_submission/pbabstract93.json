During a short-term single-blind controlled trial, one daily dose of 20 or 40 mg enalapril significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In the supine position, mean systolic blood pressure declined from 169 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 6 mmHg (P less than .01) and mean diastolic blood pressure from 101 +/- 1.5 to 85 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than .001). No changes in heart rate or postural hypotension were observed. During 1 yr of treatment, the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril did not decline, and no clinical side effects were observed. Inhibition by enalapril of angiotensin-converting enzyme did not modify daily insulin requirements, glycemic control, uricemia, or lipid metabolism; kalemia and the markers of diabetic nephropathy were not significantly altered. These results suggest that enalapril once daily should be used as the first step in the treatment of diabetic patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "1": "Dansylated tight-binding inhibitors are effective fluorophoric probes for detecting conformational changes of enzyme active sites. In this study they have been employed to examine the effect of anions on the conformation of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The efficiency of radiationless energy transfer between enzyme tryptophan residues and an active site-bound dansyl inhibitor has been shown to be enhanced by the addition of chloride. Half-maximal fluorescence enhancement occurs at about 2 mM chloride and is the same for both N-(1-carboxyl-5-dansylamino-pentyl)-glycyl-L-phenylalanine [Ki,app = 50 nM (pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl)] and N-(1-carboxyl-5-dansylamino-pentyl)-glycyl-L-lysine (Ki,app = 5.7 nM). Other activating anions also evoke similar increases in enzyme-inhibitor energy transfer. Fluorescence changes are not due to binding additional inhibitor molecules but rather to an anion-induced change in protein conformation.", 
    "2": "The effect of indomethacin (INDO), an inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) cyclooxygenase, on pulmonary vascular permeability is unclear. We measured angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in plasma and lung lymph in order to evaluate pulmonary endothelial integrity. Eighteen sheep, anesthetized and acutely prepared for the collection lung lymph, were used in the study. Four animals (Group I) served as sham controls and were not subjected to experimental intervention. In order to minimize changes in pulmonary microvascular surface area (PMSA), left atrial blood pressure (Pla) was elevated (12-20 Torr) following the baseline period in animals in the three experimental groups. Group II (n = 4) was subjected to increased Pla only in order to assess the effects of that maneuver alone on experimental parameters. Group III (n = 3) received an infusion of buffered vehicle only during a four hour period of elevated Pla, and, thus served as a vehicle control for Group IV (n = 7) which received INDO for the same period of increased Pla. Pulmonary blood pressures, cardiac output (CO), lung lymph flow (Ql) and the ratio of lymph to plasma protein concentration (L/P) were measured in all experiments in order to independently assess changes in lung vascular permeability. While ACE activity in plasma and lymph fell in each experimental group, average ACE experimental values were unchanged from corresponding baseline values. Increased Pla caused a characteristic increase in Ql and fall in L/P in each of the experimental groups. We conclude that INDO does not alter lung fluid and protein balance by a process which involves increased pulmonary vascular permeability secondary to a loss of endothelial integrity.", 
    "3": "It has been suggested that AII-mediated renal mechanisms limit the efficacy of moderate sodium restriction in the lowering of blood pressure (BP) in hypertension. We therefore studied renal hemodynamics and sodium handling in nine essential hypertensives in balance on 200 and on a 50 mmol sodium diet, before and during ACE-inhibition (enalapril 10 mg bid for 8 days) in a cross-over fashion. BP was similar on 50 and 200 mmol Na before enalapril, the fall in BP during enalapril was significantly more pronounced on 50 mmol Na. On 50 mmol Na, GFR and filtered Na were significantly lower, and tubular reabsorption was significantly higher than on 200 mmol Na. GFR increased during enalapril in 50 but not on 200 mmol Na. Consequently, the differences in GFR and filtered load elicited by sodium restriction were no longer present during ACE-inhibition. In contrast, the differences in tubular reabsorption between 50 and 200 mmol Na persisted during enalapril. In conclusion, moderate sodium restriction, not affecting BP, can elicit a renal hemodynamic response. As this response is blunted by ACE-inhibition it is probably mediated by AII. This blunting may contribute to the increased sodium sensitivity of BP during ACE-inhibition. The adaptation of tubular sodium reabsorption is not affected by ACE-inhibition.", 
    "4": "Munich-Wistar rats were studied 18 weeks following 5/6 renal ablation. In untreated group 1 rats maintained on standard chow containing 24% protein, sustained systemic and glomerular hypertension were associated with increasing proteinuria and widespread glomerular injury. In group 2, early treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril prevented systemic and glomerular hypertension, and largely limited proteinuria and glomerular injury. Groups 3 and 4 received no therapy during the first eight weeks, during which they developed systemic hypertension and levels of proteinuria previously shown to be associated with significant glomerular sclerosis at this time point. Enalapril therapy begun at eight weeks in group 3 rats reversed systemic and glomerular hypertension, prevented a further rise in proteinuria, and limited glomerular lesions at 18 weeks relative to group 1. Reduction of dietary protein content to 12% at eight weeks in group 4 rats controlled glomerular but not systemic hypertension to near-normal levels, stabilized proteinuria values, and also limited glomerular lesions at 18 weeks compared to group 1. These studies support the view that glomerular hypertension is an essential hemodynamic derangement responsible for progressive glomerular injury. Furthermore, reduction of capillary pressure can arrest the progression of remnant glomerular injury even when therapy is delayed until glomerular injury is established.", 
    "5": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and kininase activities were measured in various segments of the rabbit nephron. ACE was determined with tritiated hippuryl-glycylglycine as substrate. Lysyl-bradykinin (LBK) hydrolysis (kininase activity) was measured by radioimmunoassay. ACE was only found in the glomerulus and in the two parts of proximal tubule: the convoluted proximal tubule and the pars recta (PR). It was distributed along a concentration gradient which increased from the glomerulus to PR. Kininase activity was found in both proximal and distal parts of the nephron. Besides intense LBK-hydrolyzing activity in the proximal tubule, a kininase activity was also found in the medullary collecting tubule (MCT). Kininase activity in the glomerulus and the proximal tubule was completely inhibited by chelating agents. Captopril inhibited this activity only in the PR and at high concentrations (above 10(-7) M). These results indicate that several types of enzymes other than ACE hydrolyze kinins in the glomerulus and in the proximal tubule. The contribution of ACE to kinin hydrolysis appears only minimal. The kininase activity found in MCT was different from ACE and other proximal tubule kininases because it was not inhibited by chelating agents. This kininase may play a physiological role in inactivating the kinins formed by kallikrein at or beyond the connecting tubule.", 
    "6": "This article examines available data concerning the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system directly stimulates cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in hypertension. Several experiments support a direct effect of angiotensin on myocardial protein synthesis and suggest that this may be independent of adrenergic influences. However, the role played by the renin system in the pathogenesis of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy may be small, for left ventricular (LV) muscle mass is not systematically greater in high-renin as opposed to low-renin forms of experimental or human hypertension. In animal studies, regression of LV hypertrophy is more consistently observed in response to drugs that inhibit as opposed to those that stimulate renin-angiotensin system activity (i.e., converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-adrenoceptor blockers vs. diuretics or direct vasodilators), although the difference is more quantitative than absolute. Similarly, significant reductions in LV mass occurred in 13 of 16 human trials with converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers as opposed to 2 of 10 trials with diuretics or vasodilators (mean = 7.11; p less than 0.01). However, uncertainties regarding the degree of reduction in angiotensin II and adrenergic effects, possible interactions between these systems, and incomplete characterization of induced changes in hemodynamic load on the heart all limit the interpretation of available studies. Preliminary data suggest that an inverse relation exists between renin-angiotensin system activity and LV systolic performance in primary and secondary human hypertension, a possibility that merits further study.", 
    "7": "Adult Sprague-Dawley rats treated daily for 14 days with 50 mg/kg cyclosporin A (CsA) exhibited nephrotoxicity, characterized by reduced glomerular filtration rate, decreased urinary sodium and potassium flow, tubular enzymuria and proximal tubular structural damage. Elevations in plasma renin activity (PRA) were observed on day 4, but returned to normal within 7 days. Co-treatment of animals for the 14 day period with enalapril (8 mg/kg/day), a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), or spironolactone (25 mg/kg/day), the distal tubular antagonist of aldosterone, reduced the nephrotoxicity, although PRA remained elevated. Neither enalapril nor spironolactone affected circulating CsA levels. These data suggest that the action of aldosterone on the distal tubule may be important in the pathogenesis of CsA nephrotoxicity.", 
    "8": "Seven patients with Bartter's syndrome were investigated before and after 3 months' treatment by enalapril. Serum potassium rose from 2.4 +/- 0.5 to 3.9 +/- 0.6 mmol/L. In all patients, serum magnesium rose and bicarbonate fell. Hormonal changes were as suspected: a further stimulation of renin and a decline in aldosterone. The BP sensitivity to angiotensin II normalized in the five patients in whom the test was performed. Clearance studies during maximal water diuresis, performed in four patients, were compatible with a high proximal fractional tubular sodium reabsorption and a relatively low distal fractional sodium reabsorption. Fractional free water excretion after furosemide was also low, confirming the concept of a primary sodium reabsorption defect in the furosemide-insensitive part of the nephron in Bartter's syndrome. The only consistent change after enalapril was a further decline in distal fractional sodium reabsorption. Initiation of therapy produced a BP fall in each subject. Clinical important hypotension associated with oliguria was seen twice, but these reactions were short-lasting. The BP rose to pretreatment values within 72 hours, despite continuation of converting-enzyme inhibition. Renal function recovered, though a moderate fall in function persisted. No other side effects were noticed. We conclude that converting-enzyme inhibition improves the potassium metabolism of patients with Bartter's syndrome, without ameliorating the abnormal renal sodium handling.", 
    "9": "The antihypertensive and biochemical effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared with those of the thiazide diuretic bendrofluazide. Patients with untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension were entered into a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) with either drug therapy: from 172/103 to 147/87 mm Hg (n = 18) with enalapril and from 179/104 to 165/95 mm Hg (n = 22) with bendrofluazide; thus, enalapril produced a greater reduction (p less than 0.05) than bendrofluazide. The median dose of enalapril was 20 mg/day (range 10 to 40) and that of bendrofluazide was 5 mg/day (range 2.5 to 10). Both drugs reduced serum sodium levels by small amounts. This was significant only for enalapril (decrease of 1.3 mmol/liter, p less than 0.05). Hyponatremia was not seen in any patient. Three patients were withdrawn from each treatment group due to adverse effects, although both drugs were generally well tolerated.", 
    "10": "Adrenal responses to angiotensin II (ANG II) are enhanced with restriction of sodium intake. To determine whether increased circulating ANG II levels are responsible for the enhanced responsiveness, the adrenal and blood pressure responses to ANG II in human subjects were assessed four times: in balance on a high and a low salt diet and before and after the administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). Before enalapril administration, sodium restriction significantly increased (p less than 0.02) plasma renin activity, ANG II, and aldosterone levels; the aldosterone response to ANG II was enhanced twofold (p less than 0.01); and the blood pressure response to ANG II infusion was reduced significantly (p less than 0.05). Despite a fixed and low plasma ANG II concentration when enalapril was employed, the adrenal response to ANG II on the low salt diet was enhanced to the same degree as that observed before administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor. Conversely, enalapril substantially altered the blood pressure response to ANG II with sodium restriction, completely preventing the reduction in responsiveness. If the subjects were first given enalapril and then sodium intake was restricted, ANG II levels did not change significantly but renal excretion of both sodium and potassium was substantially modified. The rate at which renal excretion of sodium fell to match intake was retarded strikingly (p less than 0.001); conversely, renal retention of potassium increased significantly (p less than 0.03) as low salt balance was attained. Possibly because of the potassium retention, aldosterone levels rose, but significantly less than when enalapril was absent.", 
    "11": "Enalapril was used to treat five patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to congenital cardiopathy, three with ventricular septal defect, one with arterial septal defect, and one with patent ductus arteriosus. The dose of enalapril was 20 mg/day. All patients underwent pretreatment and posttreatment cardiac catheterization. It was concluded that enalapril may be a useful drug in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to congenital cardiopathy.", 
    "12": "In nine normal volunteers, a series of five venous blood samples was obtained before and up to 24 h after converting enzyme inhibition by a single oral dose of enalapril or lisinopril. Plasma renin activity and blood angiotensin I were measured. A close linear relationship was found between the increase in plasma renin activity and the increase in blood angiotensin I. The linear correlation between plasma renin activity and blood angiotensin I remained after converting enzyme inhibition. Thus, the rise in angiotensin I after inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is due to an enhanced release of renin rather than to accumulation of angiotensin I.", 
    "13": "Renal function was evaluated in 104 patients with severe chronic heart failure whom we treated with captopril or enalapril. Seventy patients showed no change or an improvement in renal function (group A), and 34 patients developed functional renal insufficiency (group B). Before converting-enzyme inhibition, group B patients received higher doses of furosemide (p less than 0.02) and had lower central venous pressures (p less than 0.05) than group A patients. After 1 to 3 months of converting-enzyme inhibition, an excessive reduction in left ventricular filling pressure (to less than 15 mm Hg) or mean arterial pressure (to less than 60 mm Hg) was noted in 28 of 34 (82%) patients in group B but in only 22 of 70 patients in group A (31%) (p less than 0.001). At the end of the study, drug-induced azotemia resolved after a reduction in the dosage of diuretics, despite unaltered treatment with captopril and enalapril. Hence, the deterioration of renal function after converting-enzyme inhibition in heart failure is not a toxic or immunologic reaction to therapy but results from specific hemodynamic events that can be ameliorated by sodium repletion.", 
    "14": "The electric organ of Torpedo marmorata contains a membrane-bound, captopril-sensitive metallopeptidase that resembles mammalian angiotensin converting enzyme (peptidyl dipeptidase A; EC 3.4.15.1). The Torpedo enzyme has now been purified to apparent homogeneity from electric organ by a procedure involving affinity chromatography using the selective inhibitor lisinopril immobilised to Sepharose via a 28-A spacer arm. The purified protein, like the mammalian enzyme, acted as a peptidyl dipeptidase in cleaving dipeptides from the C-terminus of a variety of peptide substrates, including angiotensin I, bradykinin, [Met5]enkephalin, [Leu5]enkephalin, and the model substrate hippuryl (benzoylglycyl; BzGly)-His-Leu. The hydrolysis of BzGly-His-Leu was activated by Cl-. Enzyme activity was inhibited by classical angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including captopril, enalaprilat (MK422), and lisinopril (MK521). Torpedo angiotensin converting enzyme, like its mammalian counterpart, was also able to act as an endopeptidase in hydrolysing the amidated neuropeptide substance P. Hydrolysis of substance P occurred primarily at the Phe8-Gly9 bond with release of the C-terminal tripeptide, Gly-Leu-MetNH2, and this hydrolysis was blocked by selective inhibitors. The Torpedo enzyme was recognised by a polyclonal antibody to pig kidney angiotensin converting enzyme on immunoelectrophoretic (Western) blot analysis. Thus, on the basis of substrate specificity, inhibitor sensitivity, and immunological criteria, the Torpedo enzyme closely resembles mammalian angiotensin converting enzyme. However, the Torpedo enzyme appears somewhat larger (Mr = 190,000) than the pig kidney enzyme (Mr = 180,000) on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The endogenous peptide substrate(s) for Torpedo electric organ angiotensin converting enzyme and the physiological role of the enzyme in this tissue remain to be evaluated.", 
    "15": "Twenty-five of thirty NIDDS who remained hypertensive (diastolic greater than 95 mmHg supine) after 4 weeks on bendrofluazide 2.5 mg daily (B), completed a single-blind, observer-blind randomized crossover study, in which the additional use of atenolol (50 mg daily) (A), slow-release nifedipine (20 mg twice daily) (N), and captopril (25 mg twice daily) (C) was compared. Patients took each drug for 8 weeks with dose doubling at 4 weeks if supine diastolic remained greater than 90 mmHg. All three combinations were more effective than bendrofluazide alone (p less than 0.01). In nine patients studied 2 h after tablets at the end of each treatment period nifedipine was more effective than the other two drugs (B:174/104 mmHg, A:162/95 mmHg, -8%, N:141/88 mmHg, -17%, C:157/94 mmHg, -10%, supine), whereas in 16 patients studied 15 h after their evening dose there was no significant difference. Fasting insulin and HbA1 levels were not significantly different between groups. No drug had a significant adverse effect on creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, overnight urinary albumin excretion or foot transcutaneous oxygen levels (43 degrees C). All three drugs studied were effective without deleterious effects on renal function or peripheral blood flow.", 
    "16": "1. The role of vasopressin in cardiovascular adaptation to sodium depletion was examined in rats after 6 days on a low sodium diet. Studies were performed after selective or combined blockade with d(CH2)5 Tyr(Me)AVP (AVPA), enalaprilat (CEI) and phentolamine (PHENTOL). AVPA alone had no effect on systemic haemodynamics or regional blood flow distribution. After CEI or PHENTOL pretreatment, AVPA led to significant falls in peripheral resistance and increases in cardiac output and renal blood flow. In sodium depletion, endogenous vasopressin acts as a vasoconstrictor hormone, particularly in the kidney, when either the renin-angiotensin or alpha-adrenergic system is inhibited.", 
    "17": "BW A575C (N-(1-(S)-carboxy-5-[4(3-isopropylamino-2-(R, S)-hydroxypropoxy)indole-2- carboxamido]pentyl)-(R, S)-alanyl-(S)-proline) is a chemically novel agent which exhibits in a single molecule both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking properties. BW A575C produced a competitive blockade of heart rate responses to isoprenaline in a guinea-pig right atrial preparation (pKB 7.18 +/- 0.05, cf. pindolol 8.9 +/- 0.7). BW A575C inhibited a partially purified preparation of ACE obtained from rabbit lung (IC50 10.7 +/- 2.1 nM, cf. enalaprilat, 4.4 +/- 0.8 nM). Intravenous administration of BW A575C (1-100 micrograms kg-1 min-1) to the pithed rat inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion both angiotensin I-induced pressor responses and isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. Dose-ratios obtained from such studies demonstrated that, in this preparation, BW A575C was approximately 100 times more active as an ACE inhibitor than as a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. Intravenous administration of BW A575C (1 mg kg-1) to the conscious rat inhibited angiotensin I-induced pressor responses, being approximately equipotent to enalapril and 10 times more potent than captopril. At the same dose, BW A575C had a similar duration of action as an ACE inhibitor to enalapril. Intravenous administration of BW A575C (1 mg kg-1) to either conscious dogs or rats inhibited both angiotensin I-induced pressor responses and isoprenaline-induced heart rate responses. Dose-ratios obtained from such studies demonstrated that in these species, BW A575C was 2-10 times more active as an ACE inhibitor than as a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent.", 
    "18": "Effect of exogenous serotonin and blockade of its endogenous production on Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) in testes and epididymis was studied. Serotonin (30 mg/kg) and p-chlorophenylalanine (100 mg/kg) were injected for 4 and 3 days respectively. Serotonin reduced the weights of testes, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate whereas epididymal weight increased due to fluid accumulation. ACE was significantly reduced in tissue and fluid fractions of testes and epididymis of serotonin treated rats. pCPA had no effect on ACE levels. Serotonin seems to have direct effect on epididymis also.", 
    "19": "1. To elucidate the central effect of lisinopril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ACE localization and levels were followed in the brain of Sprague-Dawley rats by quantitative in vitro autoradiography after administration of the drug. 2. Following acute lisinopril (10 mg/kg p.o.) treatment, serum ACE activity was acutely reduced, but returned to normal by 24 h. 3. Levels of ACE in most parts of the brain, including the basal ganglia and choroid plexus of all ventricles were not affected by lisinopril. Lisinopril inhibited brain ACE in the subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, circumventricular organs, where the blood brain barrier is deficient. These regions are rich in ACE and angiotensin II receptors, and are known targets for angiotensin II-induced effects on fluid, electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis. 4. These observations indicate that quantitative in vitro autoradiography is a powerful method to study the access of drugs to the central nervous system. 5. This study shows that blood brain barrier plays an important role in limiting the penetration of lisinopril into the central nervous system. The circumventricular organs may be important targets for ACE inhibitors.", 
    "20": "Vasodilators may provoke myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease. Therefore, we analyzed in conscious dogs the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by enalaprilat on parameters potentially important to provocation of myocardial ischemia, such as sympathetic activity, myocardial oxygen consumption, and vascular tone in coronary conduit and resistance vessels. Under normal sodium intake (2-4 mEq/kg/day), enalaprilat (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg i.v. during 5-min infusion with 30-min intervals, n = 8) did not modify the norepinephrine release rate into plasma (a parameter of overall sympathetic activity). The higher dosage reduced myocardial oxygen consumption (to 87 +/- 2% of control), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (to 90 +/- 1%) and coronary conduit artery tone (normalized delta diameter: +3.2 +/- 0.7%) without dilating coronary resistance vessels. Following renin-angiotensin activation by sodium deprivation (3 X 1 mg/kg furosemide plus 7 days sodium intake less than 0.2 mEq/day), enalaprilat similarly lowered myocardial oxygen consumption and reduced vascular tone both in coronary conduit (normalized delta diameter: +4.0 +/- 0.9%) and resistance vessels (delta coronary flow: +45 +/- 12%). Although MAP declined to 76 +/- 6%, heart rate and norepinephrine release rate were not modified significantly. We propose that the dilation of epicardial arteries results from a direct intramural action. Enalaprilat seems unlikely to provoke myocardial ischemia even in states with a strongly activated renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "21": "Effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, SA446, on the renin-angiotensin system, particularly on tissue ACE activity, were studied in Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (RHR) by repeated oral administration for 7 days. SA446 (45 mg/kg/day p.o.) inhibited ACE activity in the lung, brain, kidney, heart, and whole blood throughout the administration period in WKY, but showed a slight hypotensive action and no inhibition of aorta ACE activity. On the other hand, SA446 had an apparent hypotensive action at the same dose in SHR and inhibited ACE activity significantly in the aorta as well as the kidney and whole blood during the administration period. Furthermore, enzyme activity in the aorta, kidney, heart, and whole blood was also inhibited at a hypotensive dose of SA446 (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) in RHR. The inhibition in whole blood and kidney was almost complete, and the inhibition in the aorta was greater on day 7 than on day 1. The maximum decrease of blood pressure was correlated with the maximum inhibition in aorta ACE activity, but not in brain, lung, or heart ACE activity. In addition, a good positive correlation was observed between the basal blood pressure and the basal aorta ACE activity in WKY, SHR, and RHR, although there was no correlation in the brain, lung, kidney, heart, or whole blood. These results suggest that the antihypertensive action of SA446 by repeated administration may be due to inhibition of arterial ACE activity in addition to inhibition of plasma and kidney ACE activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "The present experiments were designed to elucidate the role of central angiotensin II (AII) mechanisms in maintenance of established hypertension in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by determining the blood pressure response to chronic intraventricular (i.v.t.) infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide or the AII receptor antagonist 1sar,8Thr-AII (sarthran). Male SHR (240-300 g) were given chronic indwelling arterial and venous catheters and bilateral lateral cerebral ventricular cannulae. The acute pressor responses to successive intravenous infusions of AII (sarthran experiments) or angiotensin I (AI; teprotide experiments) and to an intraventricular bolus injection of AII or AI were determined in the conscious rats. A 5-day intraventricular infusion of sarthran (1 or 6 micrograms/h) or teprotide (10 micrograms/h) in isotonic saline was maintained by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps, and pressor responses were retested on the 5th day of intraventricular infusion. Five-day intraventricular sarthran infusion at 1 and 6 micrograms/h reduced the pressor response to intraventricular AII by 48 and 74%, respectively, while intraventricular teprotide (10 micrograms/h) inhibited the pressor response to intraventricular AI by 25%. None of the intraventricular infusions significantly decreased pressor responsiveness to intravenous AII or AI. In separate groups of SHR, tail-cuff blood pressure was monitored before, during, and after a 1-week intraventricular teprotide infusion (10 micrograms/h) or successive intraventricular infusions of sarthran at 1 microgram/h for 2 weeks followed by 6 micrograms/h for 1 week. Neither chronic intraventricular sarthran or teprotide caused a significant lowering of blood pressure in SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Fifteen unselected patients who had essential hypertension and whose average supine blood pressure when they were not receiving any treatment and their usual sodium intake was 162/107 mm Hg were treated with captopril 50 mg twice daily. After one month's treatment their supine blood pressure had decreased to 149/94 mm Hg. They were then instructed to reduce their sodium intake to about 80 mmol(mEq)/day. After two weeks of moderate sodium restriction they were entered into a double blind randomised crossover study comparing the effect of 10 Slow Sodium tablets (100 mmol sodium chloride) with matching placebo tablets while continuing to take captopril and restrict sodium in their diet. After one month of taking placebo their mean supine blood pressure was 137/88 mm Hg with a urinary sodium excretion of 83 mmol/24 h, while after one month of taking Slow Sodium tablets their mean supine blood pressure was 150/97 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) with a sodium excretion of 183 mmol/24 h. The mean supine blood pressure during moderate sodium restriction therefore decreased by 9% and correlated significantly with the reduction in urinary sodium excretion. These results suggest that the combination of treatment with a moderate but practical reduction in sodium intake and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in decreasing the blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. This combined approach overcomes some of the objections that have been made to salt restriction alone and to converting enzyme inhibitors alone.", 
    "24": "The effects of captopril on renal function and prostaglandin E2 excretion were investigated in rabbits undergoing chronic sodium depletion. Captopril administered for six days, via rate-controlled osmotic pumps, caused diuresis and marked natriuresis which were accompanied by a significant reduction of urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion and of glomerular filtration rate. It is concluded that captopril reduces the renal excretion of prostaglandin E2 and that its diuretic and natriuretic effects are prostaglandin E2-independent.", 
    "25": "Diuretics and beta-blocking agents have been used for several years as first-step drugs in the treatment of hypertension. There is now growing evidence that calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can also be administered as first-line antihypertensive agents. These agents offer attractive features from the hemodynamic and metabolic viewpoint and with regard to side effects. Diuretics, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, administered either alone or in combination, normalize blood pressure in almost all hypertensive patients.", 
    "26": "The effects of lisinopril (MK-521; MSD) and atenolol in the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were compared in a double-blind, parallel, controlled study, with 24 patients randomly assigned to lisinopril and 12 to atenolol. Patients in both groups whose blood pressure did not respond satisfactorily were given hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The groups were matched for age, race and pretreatment blood pressure. Response to therapy was similar in the atenolol and lisinopril groups, but the combination of lisinopril and HCTZ produced a better response than atenolol plus HCTZ. Indian patients appeared to respond better to lisinopril than black patients, but the hypotensive response to lisinopril plus HCTZ was similar. Plasma renin activity rose and the plasma aldosterone level fell after taking lisinopril. Adverse effects did not occur and only 1 patient on lisinopril 20 mg/d was withdrawn from the study because of postural hypotension. Lisinopril alone and combined with HCTZ in Indian patients and lisinopril combined with HCTZ in black patients produced a satisfactory fall in blood pressure.", 
    "27": "One hundred and seventy-four patients who were receiving drug therapy for hypertension were asked to restrict their sodium intake for three months. At the end of that time their drug therapy was replaced with enalapril and the dose of the drug \"titrated\" to obtain a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg. Sodium restriction caused a small fall in blood pressure and could be used as sole therapy in only 6% of patients. Enalapril therapy was instituted without problems and control of blood pressure below 90 mmHg was achieved in 62% of persons with monotherapy. The number of tablets of enalapril that were taken was reduced from 5.9 to 2.7; in most patients these were taken once a day. There were few side-effects and no depression of white cell count, no proteinuria and no deterioration of renal function. Seventy-six per cent of patients preferred the new regimen either because they felt better than with their previous therapy (52%) or because of the more simple regimen (24%). Enalapril was an effective, well tolerated antihypertensive agent and potentially has a major role to play in the management of patients with high blood pressure.", 
    "28": "Blacks experience greater incidence, morbidity, and mortality from hypertension in comparison with whites. Blacks also respond differently to antihypertensive agents. While whites tend to respond in similar fashion to many of the different classes of antihypertensives, blacks consistently have the best response to thiazide diuretics. When a second drug is needed for blood pressure control, there are a number of choices: a beta-blocker, an alpha-beta blocker, an alphablocker, a centrally acting agent, a peripherally acting agent, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or a calcium channel blocker. Choosing among these involves considerations of efficacy, likelihood of compliance, and symptomatic and metabolic side effects-all important factors. Clinical experience with the ACE inhibitors, and captopril in particular, has shown the value of adding such a drug to a diuretic regimen, both in terms of controlling blood pressure and reducing metabolic derangements, and subsequently, cardiovascular risk factors. Labetalol, the alpha-beta blocker, and prazosin, the alphablocker, have also produced good results in some studies when combined with a thiazide in black patients.", 
    "29": "We have investigated the relationship between the acute blood pressure lowering effect of captopril and renin status. Differences in renin status were induced by unilateral artery clipping combined with unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy in rats. The blood pressure lowering effect of captopril correlated very closely with plasma or aortic renin across a very wide range of renin levels.", 
    "30": "Treatment has one of two fundamental goals, relief of symptoms or a change in natural history. In general, a treatment goal of symptom relief is easier to achieve. One treats each day for symptoms that day, and a patient's compliance is maintained when symptoms are relieved. Treatment that has as its goal a change in natural history, without providing symptom relief, is fundamentally more difficult: one treats today for events that might occur tomorrow--or months or years later. The revolution in what we have available for treatment has been accompanied by an evolution in expectations. In the area of hypertension the expectations are stringent. The physician cannot provide the patient with symptom relief, because there are no symptoms directly attributable to the hypertension--although few individuals are free of symptoms. The short-term goal is to control the high blood pressure at a minimal cost in adverse reactions; the long-term goal is to change natural history. Two decades ago antihypertensive therapy was restricted to very severe hypertension. The available agents were difficult to use, and they produced substantial side effects. Over the past several decades each wave of new agents has provided some improvement in efficacy, but primarily a reduction in the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. Today, at a time when we often wish to treat mild hypertension, the goal is to have patients feel as well on treatment as they do off it. A progressive reduction in the frequency and severity of central nervous system side effects is one of the major features of the evolution of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "In plexus containing preparations of the longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig ileum, an inhibitory action of tetracyclines on twitch-responses to electrical field stimulation was found. Tetracycline, chlortetracycline, minocycline and doxycycline, but not oxytetracycline (0.02 to 1.6 mmol/l) caused a concentration-dependent presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release. The inhibitory effect of the tetracyclines was also obtained after ganglion block by hexamethonium (30 mumol/l). The inhibitory effect of the tetracyclines was not antagonized by piperoxan (2 mumol/l) or yohimbine (1 mumol/l) and was partly reduced by the presence of naloxone (1 to 50 nmol/l). After exposing the preparation the peptidase inhibitors, i.e., to the combination of bestatin (10 mumol/l), captopril (10 mumol/l) and thiorphan (0.3 mumol/l), the inhibitory effect of tetracyclines was significantly increased. From these results it would appear that twitch-inhibition caused by tetracycline, chlortetracycline, minocycline and doxycycline is mainly mediated via the release of endogenous opioids from the myenteric plexus.", 
    "32": "Captopril, an inhibitor of the conversion enzyme, is a medication with a known efficacy in the treatment of arterial hypertension and congestive cardiac insufficiency. Its side-effects are few. Among them, agranulocytosis is a severe complication, all the more severe and frequent as it occurs in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, collagen disease, or patient treated with medication having a leucopenic potential. Our case reports an agranulocytosis secondary to captopril in a patient with cardiac insufficiency presenting none of these aggravating factors. The mechanism of agranulocytosis secondary to captopril remains currently debatable, but does not seem, in the present case, to be dose related. Thus, a captopril prescription must comply with certain rules; decrease of the dosage in case of renal insufficiency, usual precautions in patients with collagene diseases. The association to a medication with leucopenic potential is to be avoided. Hematologic monitoring will be adapted to each particular case.", 
    "33": "Using spermatic nerve preparations from testis superior, the effects of temperature rise on chemical responses were studied in vitro, within both subthreshold and suprathreshold ranges for testicular polymodal receptors, one type of visceral nociceptor. In the range of temperature subthreshold for polymodal receptors, the responses to algesic substances tested were greater at higher temperatures. The mean discharge rates induced by various concentrations of bradykinin (BK, 9 X 10(-9)-9 X 10(-6) M), were significantly greater at 36 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. Responses to hypertonic saline, tested in the temperature range, 34-43 degrees C, showed similar temperature-dependent increases, and Q10 values between 2.3 and 4.2. In the units exhibiting 'heat sensitization' with repeated testing of suprathreshold temperature rises, the response to hypertonic saline (616 mM) at 34 degrees C also increased. Although calor in the inflamed tissues is in itself not high enough to cause excitation of 'pain receptors,' temperature-dependent augmentation of chemical responses of the polymodal receptor might partly explain peripheral hyperalgesic behaviour observable in inflamed tissue on the basis of sensory receptor activity.", 
    "34": "The hypothesis that a primary stimulus for aortic medial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is increased blood pressure was tested by determining whether development of smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperploidy in SHR could be dissociated from blood pressure levels in rats treated with various antihypertensive drugs with different mechanisms of action. Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR were treated between 2 and 5 months of age with captopril (375 mg/L), hydralazine (40 mg/L), or propranolol (1.5 mg/L) administered in their drinking water. Smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperploidy were analyzed by morphometric evaluation of medial smooth muscle content, flow cytometric analysis of the frequency of polyploid smooth muscle cells, and biochemical estimates of smooth muscle cell number. All drugs significantly lowered blood pressure in SHR compared with untreated controls (order of efficacy: captopril greater than hydralazine greater than propranolol). Captopril also was most effective at changing blood pressure in WKY, while propranolol and hydralazine had similar blood pressure-lowering effects. The efficacy of drugs in preventing the development of smooth muscle cell polyploidism and medial hypertrophy in SHR was the same as their efficacy in lowering blood pressure, although propranolol had no effect on medial smooth muscle hypertrophy despite lowering blood pressure by 26 mm Hg. Regression analyses showed a high degree of correlation between blood pressure and the frequency of polyploid smooth muscle cells and medial smooth muscle content. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that aortic medial hypertrophy may be, in part, a response to increased blood pressure or wall stress. However, analysis of covariance and two-stage multiple regression analyses indicated that captopril had an effect over and above that predicted by its blood pressure-lowering effect. Furthermore, propranolol lowered blood pressure but did not affect medial hypertrophy. These results suggest that smooth muscle hypertrophy is not simply a response to increased blood pressure, but that other factors, such as angiotensin II, may be important in modulating aortic medial hypertrophy in SHR.", 
    "35": "Several experiments tested whether the subfornical organ (SFO) is necessary for water or NaCl intake arising from angiotensin-converting enzyme (CE) blockade with captopril (CAP) in the drinking fluids (0.1 mg/ml). Peripheral CAP was given to rats acutely following 24-h water deprivation or chronically over several days, either with water alone available for drinking or with 0.3 M NaCl in choice with water. Control rats drank more water, and NaCl when it was available, during CAP treatment, whereas rats with SFO damage increased NaCl intake only. CAP decreased urinary volume (UV) and increased urinary potassium excretion (UKV) during rehydration with only water available and increased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) with NaCl present. Regardless of CAP treatment, rats with SFO damage had increased electrolyte concentrations and excretions during rehydration with only water available and increased UK with NaCl present, compared with controls. Oral CAP did not have an aversive taste at the dose used here. We conclude that the SFO is necessary for CAP-enhanced water, but not NaCl, intake and suggest that different neurological mechanisms control ingestion of each fluid during CAP.", 
    "36": "The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that elevate arterial pressure differ according to the patient's age, adipose body mass, and race. However, these mechanisms represent the extremes of a continuum, and overlap among them can be encountered in some patients. A few simple clinical clues allow the physician to identify whether an increase in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, or both is the predominant mechanism in a given patient. Antihypertensive therapy should be aimed not only at lowering arterial pressure but also, more importantly, at ameliorating the concomitant pathophysiologic abnormality. A beta-adrenoreceptor blocker is the initial drug of choice in young patients with \"cardiogenic hypertension.\" In middle-aged patients, cardiac output is usually normal and elevated total peripheral resistance becomes the hemodynamic culprit. In these patients, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, antiadrenergic drug, or calcium channel blocker should be given to lower total peripheral resistance without affecting cardiac output. In elderly patients, the burden on the heart should be lessened by use of an agent that lowers preload and afterload, such as an ACE inhibitor or certain of the calcium blockers. In obese patients in whom intravascular volume is expanded and in most black patients, the initial antihypertensive agent of choice remains a thiazide diuretic unless left ventricular hypertrophy is present.", 
    "37": "Besulpamide, a newly synthesized compound, has demonstrated significant diuretic activity in rats and dogs, similar to that of chlorthalidone, clopamide and xipamide. Antihypertensive activity of besulpamide is similar to that of hydrochlorothiazide and was demonstrated in rat one-kidney desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension. In addition, besulpamide, like hydrochlorothiazide, potentiated the antihypertensive activity of captopril in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Doses of besulpamide exceeding those normally required for pharmacological activity did not evoke adverse reactions in rats and mice.", 
    "38": "Two groups, each with nine essential hypertensive patients, were maintained on 10 mmol sodium daily over 14-17 days and treated in this sequence: placebo; captopril (25 or 50 mg given thrice daily) or indomethacin (50 mg given thrice daily) alone; captopril plus indomethacin, and (4) captopril alone. The initial fall in mean blood pressure induced by captopril (118 +/- 1 to 102 +/- 1 mmHg) was unaffected by the addition of indomethacin. However, if indomethacin treatment preceded captopril, the antihypertensive effect was attenuated (116 +/- 4 to 109 +/- 4), and was associated with significant reductions in urinary prostaglandin and kinin excretion. Addition of captopril to indomethacin returned kinin excretion to placebo levels but did not affect indomethacin-induced reduction in prostaglandin excretion. Captopril alone stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA) fivefold; aldosterone excretion was lowered by 25% and further reduced by indomethacin. Thus, when captopril and indomethacin are administered together, the order of administration is critical to the antihypertensive effect of captopril.", 
    "39": "It is well known dermorphin is a potent and long-acting opioid peptide while its synthetic L-form is almost completely devoid of biological activity. We investigated whether the L-Ala2 residue might affect the affinity of the compound for opioid receptors or make [L-Ala2] dermorphin more sensitive to metabolic degradation. Dermorphin and [L-Ala2] dermorphin were assayed in [3H]naloxone binding to opioid receptors in rat brain preparations in the absence and presence of peptidase inhibitors bestatin, captopril and thiorphan. The synthetic [L-Ala2] dermorphin showed very low affinity for the opioid receptors. This was only slightly increased in the presence of the peptidase inhibitor bestatin, alone and in combination with captopril and thiorphan. The low affinity of [L-Ala2] dermorphin was not improved even when the binding assay was carried out at 0 degrees C. We suggest that the D-Ala2 residue is essential for the binding of dermorphin to the opioid receptors as well as for its pharmacological activity.", 
    "40": "Angiotensin converting enzyme was localized in rat brain by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using an [125I]labelled converting enzyme inhibitor called \"351A\". This radioligand was found to bind with high affinity and specificity to angiotensin converting enzyme. Very high levels of converting enzyme were observed in the ventricular choroid plexus, ependyma of all ventricles and large and medium blood vessels, subfornical organ, and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. High levels of converting enzyme were found in the basal ganglia including caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, entopenduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. The neurosecretory nuclei, paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus, as well as the median eminence and posterior pituitary displayed high levels of the enzyme. In the amygdala, basolateral, lateral, basomedial, medial and anterior cortical nuclei showed moderate converting enzyme activity. The medial habenula and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus showed high levels of activity. In the cerebellum, dense labelling was observed in the Purkinje cell layer. Moderate levels of converting enzyme occurred in the gelatinosus subnucleus of the caudal part of the nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal. There was a close correspondence between the distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin II in the neurosecretory nuclei (paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei) and median eminence and this suggests a role of angiotensin converting enzyme in the production of angiotensin II in this system. There was also a good correspondence between the distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin II in the subfornical organ, median preoptic nucleus, and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, structures abutting the anterior wall of the third ventricle which are implicated in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. A striking discrepancy occurs in the basal ganglia which is reported to contain very little angiotensin II or angiotensin II receptors but is very rich in angiotensin converting enzyme. It is concluded that the enzyme may act to convert circulating angiotensin I to angiotensin II in circumventricular organs; generate intraneuronal angiotensin II in pathways such as the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract; and process neuropeptides other than angiotensin II in regions such as basal ganglia.", 
    "41": "(2R,4R)-2-(o-Hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3-mercaptopropionyl)-4- thiazolidinecarboxylic acid (rentiapril, SA 446), an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, was examined for effects upon general reproductive performance, for embryofoetal toxicity and for peri- and postnatal toxicity in the rat at dosages of 0, 20, 100 and 500 mg/kg/d. Embryofoetal toxicity was also examined in the New Zealand White rabbit at dosages of 0, 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/d. The compound was administered by gastric intubation. Prolonged treatment at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d during the fertility study was associated with some slight depression of body weight gain of males. Body weight gain of females during gestation was significantly depressed at 500 mg/kg/d. There was salivation in both sexes at 500 mg/kg/d and also in males receiving 100 mg/kg/d. Following this prolonged treatment in the fertility study. Fo male and female kidney weights were increased at all dosages. Although there was no obvious effect upon fertility there was an increased incidence of total litter loss at 500 mg/kg/d and mean pup weights to day 21 post partum were reduced at this dosage and at 100 mg/kg/d with delays in the attainment of some of the developmental landmarks. In the rat treatment at 500 mg/kg/d from day 7 to 17 of pregnancy did not adversely effect embryofoetal development. Subsequent development and reproductive performance of the F1 offspring was also unimpaired. During this treatment period signs of salivation were seen at 500 mg/kg/d. Slight retardation of maternal body weight gain was noted at 500 mg/kg/d and at 100 mg/kg/d but not at 20 mg/kg/d.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

SA 446 given intravenously lowered blood pressure in anesthetized rats and rabbits dose-dependently, while it had no remarkable effect in conscious rats even at a dose of 100 mg/kg orally or intravenously. SA 446 had no effect on heart rate in anesthetized rabbits up to 100 mg/kg i.v.

    "43": "Effects of condensed tannins isolated from Rhei Rhizoma on the activities of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and various proteases were examined in vitro. Among the various condensed tannins tested, procyanidin B-5 3,3'-di-O-gallate and procyanidin C-1 3,3',3\"-tri-O-gallate strongly inhibited the activity of ACE. The concentration of procyanidin B-5 3,3'-di-O-gallate required for 50% inhibition of ACE was 1.3 X 10(-6) M. The inhibition of ACE by condensed tannins was reversible and non-competitive, according to dialysis and to Dixon plots. However, over one hundred times the concentration was required to inhibit activities of other proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, leucine aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase A and urinary kallikrein. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of condensed tannins on the activities of ACE are specific.", 
    "44": "Prolonged isometric relaxation in hypertensive aortic and caudal arterial smooth muscle has been demonstrated; however, isobaric relaxation in resistance arteries is more pertinent to studies in hypertension. A comparative study of mesenteric arterial isobaric relaxation times was made using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and MK-421 treated SHR (treatment commenced at 8 weeks of age and was maintained until sacrifice). Relaxation rates of vessels constricting against a range of pressures and achieving different degrees of narrowing or changes in circumference were analyzed. Comparisons were made between SHR, WKY, and MK-421 treated SHR arteries that had constricted from the same initial circumference and against the same magnitude of pressure. The SHR mesenteric arteries relaxed at a slower rate than did the WKY vessels. The normotensive MK-421 treated SHR showed the same prolonged relaxation rate as did the untreated SHR preparations. Thus the slower rate of relaxation in SHR arteries does not appear to be a consequence of the hypertension. Such prolonged time for narrowing would function to increase the average peripheral resistance and thus may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of increased blood pressure.", 
    "45": "VIP acutely enhanced the plasma concentration of aldosterone (but not that of corticosterone) both in normal rats, and in rats chronically treated with dexamethasone and ACTH or captopril and angiotensin II. VIP increased aldosterone blood concentration in chronically captopril-treated animals, but not in rats in which ACTH secretion was inhibited by dexamethasone. These findings suggest that VIP is specifically involved in the stimulation of the secretory activity of rat zona glomerulosa, and that this action of VIP requires a normal level of circulating ACTH.", 
    "46": "The acute effect on the renin-angiotensin system and the pharmacokinetic properties of delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and its active diacid metabolites (delapril diacid and 5-hydroxy delapril diacid) arising from delapril in vivo were investigated in 4 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure (CRF: 4 males, average age 49.5 (37-64) years, mean Ccr 22.2 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 9 patients with essential hypertension (EH: 6 males, 3 females, average age 42.8 (28-61) years, mean Ccr 79.3 ml/min/1.73 m2). In CRF, following a single dose of delapril hydrochloride (30 mg), the biological half lives (t1/2) of delapril diacid and 5-OH-delapril diacid were 4.69, 12.88 hours, the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ([AUC]24(0)) of delapril and its diacid metabolites were 414, 797 and 435 ng/ml, and 658, 6400 and 5068 ng X h/ml, respectively.

The [AUC]24(0) in CRF were significantly increased as compared with those in EH. The cumulative urinary excretions were significantly lower in CRF than in EH.

    "47": "The tolerance to and dynamic effects of 1 week's oral treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, were assessed in a placebo controlled, parallel group study in 36 normotensive males. The daily dose of perindopril was 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 mg. The drug was well tolerated and produced no change in routine haematology or serum biochemistry tests. Dose related inhibition of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme was observed. Perindopril 16 mg produced 90% inhibition 4 h after dosing and 60% after 24 h. A dose related rise in plasma renin activity followed doses of 4 mg and over. The renin remained above the normal range for 24 h. Perindopril caused a modest lowering of plasma aldosterone levels but had no effect on plasma adrenaline or noradrenaline levels. Standing diastolic blood pressure was lowered, particularly with 16 mg daily of perindopril but only a slight rise in heart rate occurred. Perindopril appears to be a well tolerated inhibitor of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme, with predictable effects on the renin angiotensin system and blood pressure. An appropriate dose range for further study would appear to be 4 to 16 mg daily.", 
    "48": "This study was designed to investigate the validity of the then current recommendations for initiation of therapy with enalapril in hypertensive patients on treatment with a diuretic. Enalapril in single doses of 10 and 20 mg was given to 13 hypertensive patients on treatment with bendrofluazide 5 mg daily in a randomised, crossover, placebo controlled study. The mean maximal reduction in blood pressure was similar with both doses (35/20 mmHg supine, 38/20 mmHg standing), occurred on average within 6 h of tablet ingestion, and was not accompanied by any significant change in heart rate. Three patients experienced symptomatic hypotension. In one patient this was incapacitating after 10 mg and precluded exposure to 20 mg. This study shows that in hypertensive patients receiving treatment with diuretics, the addition of enalapril should be undertaken with caution. An optimal starting dose of enalapril in such patients remains to be confirmed.", 
    "49": "Bradykinin is degraded in human plasma by a carboxypeptidase to yield desArg9-bradykinin (DBK) which is then digested by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to the pentapeptide Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe and the tripeptide Ser-Pro-Phe. We have studied the rate of kinin degradation by each of these enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), compared with the degradation rate in degenerative joint disease and normal subjects. Carboxypeptidase activity was the same in all individuals, but ACE activity was increased in the RA and SLE patients. We examined the effects of aspirin, sodium salicylate, auranofin, penicillamine, and corticosteroids on kinin metabolism, and all of these were marked inhibitors of ACE; however, only penicillamine had any demonstrable inhibition of carboxypeptidase. These observations suggest rapid degradation of DBK in patients with untreated RA and SLE, whereas drugs utilized in therapy have the opposite effects. Studies to examine the role of DBK in disease manifestations are in progress.", 
    "50": "Temporary thoracic aortic occlusion can result in renal insufficiency with or without adjuncts to avoid distal hypoperfusion. In a canine model of thoracic aortic occlusion, left atrial to left femoral bypass was compared with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Renin-angiotensin system blockade with the converting enzyme inhibitor, MK422, resulted in restoration of baseline renal blood flow and glomerular filtration 30 minutes after cross-clamp release. Left atrial to left femoral bypass resulted in significant reduction in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration 30 minutes after cross-clamp release. Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the altered renal hemodynamics and glomerular filtration rates after thoracic aortic occlusion.", 
    "51": "The hypotensive efficacy of a potent new renin inhibitor (N alpha-isovaleryl-L-histidyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-histidyl-ACHPA+ ++-L- phenylalanyl amide) containing (3S,4S)-4-amino-5-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxy pentanoic acid (ACHPA) was compared with the converting enzyme inhibitor (enalaprilat) (MK-422) in conscious one-kidney dogs before and after tightening a renal artery clamp. Dose-response curves to 0.003 to 0.1 mg/kg/min i.v. infusions of the ACHPA-containing renin inhibitory peptide or enalaprilat (0.003-0.1 mg/kg i.v. bolus) were obtained in one-kidney dogs before and 3 days and 14 days after renal artery constriction. The ACHPA-containing renin inhibitory peptide and enalaprilat maximally decreased blood pressure by 10 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 2 mm Hg before constriction and by 12 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 4 mm Hg in dogs treated 14 days after renal artery constriction, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were unaltered or slightly improved. In sharp contrast, both compounds elicited significant, dose-related decreases in blood pressure (-26 +/- 4 and -20 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively), glomerular filtration rate (-21 +/- 3 and -23 +/- 3 ml/min), and renal plasma flow (-45 +/- 14 and -48 +/- 13 ml/min) in dogs examined 3 days after renal artery constriction. These data demonstrate that ACHPA-containing renin inhibitory peptide and enalaprilat are equally effective antihypertensive agents in dogs with renin-dependent renovascular hypertension and lend credence to the contention that the renin-angiotensin system supports renal function in hypertensive states in which renin levels are elevated.", 
    "52": "We compared the cardiovascular and hormonal responses to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and hemorrhage of 20% of blood volume in chronically instrumented unanesthetized newborn lambs and adult sheep. Administration of the nonsulfhydryl-containing converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril reduced mean arterial pressure in the newborn but not in the adult animals. Blood pressure fell in both age groups after hemorrhage, and the hemorrhage-induced fall in blood pressure, integrated over the period of hypovolemia, was more pronounced when converting-enzyme inhibition was present in the lambs. This was not observed in the adults. Cardiac output fell following hemorrhage in both age groups, and the fall was greater when enalapril was present in the lambs, but this was not the case in the adults. Hemorrhage increased plasma renin activity in both groups, and enalapril augmented this increase. Plasma concentrations of vasopressin and catecholamines increased following hemorrhage within and between groups. Taken together these data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a more important role in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis in newborn lambs than it does in adult sheep, and catecholamine and vasopressin responses to volume loss can occur in the presence of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "53": "Cultures of dissociated brain cells from 15-day-old fetal mice were grown in the presence and absence of 20 or 50 nM triiodothyronine (T3), 30 or 300 nM cortisol, and 30 nM cortisol plus 50 nM T3 added to chemically defined media or in media supplemented with 15% serum from control and hypothyroid calves. The specific activities of five lysosomal enzymes--N-acetyl galactosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, cathepsin B, and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I (DAP-I)--were higher in cells grown in calf serum than in cells grown in defined media. Of these enzymes, only DAP-I was elevated in activity when the cells were grown in hypothyroid calf serum instead of control calf serum. Elevation of DAP-I activity was reversed by addition of 20 nM T3 to hypothyroid calf serum. The enzymatic properties of DAP-I were similar whether the cells were grown in control or hypothyroid calf serum and were similar to those reported for human fibroblasts and the purified enzyme. When the cells were grown in defined media, cortisol decreased the activities of all lysosomal enzymes, with 300 nM cortisol being more effective than 30 nM cortisol. Addition of 50 nM T3 to 30 nM cortisol decreased DAP-I activity more than 30 nM cortisol alone, but 50 nM T3 alone in defined media did not alter DAP-I levels. The reduction of DAP-I activity in these cells by T3 required cortisol, unidentified components in serum, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "In rats with severe two-kidney, one clip (2-K,1C) hypertension the time-course of changes in left and right ventricular (LV and RV) weight and LV dimensions was assessed following initiation of chronic treatment with minoxidil, enalapril or removal of the clipped kidney in relation to changes in blood pressure (BP) and sympathetic activity, as well as plasma and blood volumes. Minoxidil decreased BP markedly, but tolerance to the antihypertensive effect developed after 2-3 weeks. In contrast, enalapril or uninephrectomy caused a rapid and persistent normalization of BP. Significant increases in LV and RV weight occurred after 3-5 weeks of treatment with minoxidil. Left ventricular wall thickness decreased over the initial 1-2 weeks and then returned to untreated levels. Left ventricular internal dimensions showed an increase after 1-2 weeks of minoxidil, which persisted with more prolonged treatment. With enalapril, regression to normal occurred for both LV and RV weight within 1 week of treatment. Following uninephrectomy a more gradual regression took place and normal cardiac weight was not obtained until 3 weeks. Indices of sympathetic activity (plasma catecholamines, BP response to hexamethonium or heart rate) did not differ significantly in minoxidil treatment versus untreated hypertensive rats from 2 to 35 days of treatment. A significant increase in heart rate was found after 1 day of minoxidil and a decrease after enalapril. Plasma and blood volumes were elevated in minoxidil-treated rats from 7 to 35 days, as well as initially after uninephrectomy. Therefore, in 2-K, 1C hypertensive rats long-term treatment with minoxidil induces both RV hypertrophy and LV eccentric hypertrophy. Changes in cardiac volume load may play a major role in the differing effects of different antihypertensive therapies on cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "55": "Peptidyl-dipeptidase A (angiotensin converting enzyme; ACE, EC 3.4.15.1), has been purified from pig kidney and striatum by affinity chromatography employing the selective inhibitor lisinopril as ligand. The inclusion of a 2.8 nm spacer arm improved the yield of the enzyme compared with the 1.4 nm spacer arm described in previous work. Two forms of striatal ACE (Mr 180,000 and 170,000), but only a single form of kidney ACE (Mr 180,000), were isolated by this procedure. Both forms of striatal ACE were recognized by a polyclonal antibody to kidney ACE. No significant differences in substrate specificity or inhibitor sensitivity between kidney and striatal ACE could be detected. In particular, the amidated neuropeptide, substance P, was hydrolysed identically by both preparations and no significant hydrolysis of the related tachykinin peptides neurokinin A and neurokinin B could be detected. After chemical or enzymic deglycosylation, kidney and both forms of striatal ACE migrated identically on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr of 150,000. We suggest that the two detectable forms of ACE in pig brain are not isoenzymes but are the result of differential glycosylation in different cell types in the brain. It appears that ACE, unlike endopeptidase-24.11, does not have the general capacity to hydrolyse and inactivate the tachykinin peptides at a significant rate in brain.", 
    "56": "According to classic pharmacologic theory, agonist/antagonist competition can be used to quantify an antagonist's potency by measurement of agonist dose-response curves in the presence of varying doses of the antagonist. We used this principle to characterize the interaction between angiotensin I (AI) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril in humans. In addition, by comparing the effects of AI and angiotensin II before and after administration of a 30-mg dose of cilazapril, we could show the specific AI antagonism of the ACE inhibitor in humans. To obtain the antagonist's dose-response curves, six healthy male volunteers received five single oral doses of cilazapril, 0.5-8.0 mg. Enalapril, 10 mg, and captopril, 12.5 mg, served as positive controls and placebo as the negative control. Dose-response curves following intravenous infusions of AI were established 4 h after oral ingestion of the ACE inhibitors. Noninvasively measured systolic and diastolic blood pressures and total peripheral resistance assessed AI effects. Cilazapril dose dependently shifted the AI dose-response curve rightward, with 1.0 mg inducing a twofold shift. Enalapril and captopril appear less potent, on a milligram basis, in antagonizing AI effects 4 h after drug intake. The methodology could be a useful tool for a rational testing and comparison of ACE inhibitors in clinical pharmacology.", 
    "57": "We conducted a prospective evaluation of the effects of chronic captopril therapy on glucose tolerance in 8 nondiabetic, hypertensive patients and 6 hypertensive patients with impaired glucose tolerance, including 3 diabetic patients. Captopril was well tolerated by all patients, and no untoward effects were observed. Chronic captopril therapy produced a significant decrease in blood pressure in all patients. No patients with normal glucose tolerance developed diabetes mellitus. Neither fasting nor post-glucose-load venous plasma glucose deteriorated in any patients during chronic captopril therapy. There were no significant changes in the insulinogenic index (delta IRI/delta BS at 30 min post-glucose load) in patients with either normal or impaired glucose tolerance. These results suggest that, in addition to its antihypertensive effect, chronic captopril therapy does not compromise glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients. Thus, captopril may have a clinical advantage in that it apparently can be given safely to hypertensive patients with either normal or impaired glucose metabolism.", 
    "58": "SQ 27,786 and SQ 28,853 were designed to possess both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and diuretic properties. Both compounds were given to conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats and mongrel female dogs to determine ACE inhibitory and diuretic activities. All animals had previously been equipped with indwelling arterial and venous catheters. Both compounds resulted in dose-related inhibition of an angiotensin I pressor response in rats after i.v. administration. The maximum response and duration of effect of both compounds were similar to that seen with equimolar doses of captopril. Oral doses of SQ 28,853 (50.0 mumol/kg) and SQ 27,786 (15.0 mumol/kg) resulted in 15 and 64% inhibition of ACE, respectively. In conscious normotensive dogs, both compounds (2.0 mg/kg, i.v.) resulted in complete inhibition of ACE. Urine volume was increased by 153 and 667% after SQ 27,786 and SQ 28,853, respectively. Similarly, sodium excretion was increased by 336% after SQ 27,786 and by 650% after SQ 28,853. SQ 27,786 and SQ 28,853 increased potassium excretion by 54 and 115%, respectively. No significant changes in blood pressure were observed with either compound in either species. These results demonstrate that both SQ 27,786 and SQ 28,853 are potent ACE inhibitors and diuretic agents in vivo.", 
    "59": "Despite the physiologic rationale of their use in hypertension, traditional vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil are often relegated to the second and, more often, to the third and fourth steps of step-care programs. Although they are powerful blood pressure-lowering agents, they cause tachycardia, excessive renin stimulation and sodium retention, and cannot be used as the only antihypertensive agent. The characteristics of the antihypertensive action of calcium antagonists make them suitable for monotherapy. Indeed, all calcium antagonists, while effectively lowering blood pressure through vasodilation, either do not affect heart rate (verapamil and its analogs) or cause a moderate and transient heart rate increase (dihydropyridine compounds). Dihydropyridines also possess a natriuretic effect, probably due to inhibition of tubular sodium transport. The natriuretic effect is evident during the first 2 days of administration, but a small negative sodium balance persists for at least 1 week. There is no increase in body weight or fluid volumes with long-term administration of calcium antagonists with a marked acute natriuretic response, such as dihydropyridines, and those antagonists with a very moderate immediate natriuretic response, such as verapamil. All calcium antagonists, therefore, appear capable of preventing the sodium and water retention that vasodilatation would otherwise entail. More liberal step-care guidelines are now possible to find the agent most suitable for the individual patient. In these guidelines, calcium antagonists, as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, are considered as possible first-choice agents along with diuretics and beta blockers.", 
    "60": "Since there are isolated case reports linking cough with angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment, we reviewed the case notes of patients attending a hypertension outpatient clinic. Of 126 patients, 37 were on medications other than ACE inhibitors, and none complained of cough. In contrast, 12 of 89 patients receiving an ACE inhibitor had noted cough. The symptoms remained when one ACE inhibitor was substituted for another, but disappeared when the drug was withdrawn. Cough was sufficiently irritating to require cessation of treatment in two patients. We conclude that cough is not uncommon during treatment with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "61": "The traditional concept of the renin-angiotensin system is a circulation-borne endocrine system whose components are secreted by different organs, i.e., renin from the kidney, angiotensinogen from the liver and angiotensin-converting enzyme from the lung. The product of the biochemical cascade, angiotensin II, acts on specific receptors on multiple target organs. Recent data, however, demonstrate that renin and angiotensin are synthesized locally in many tissues. The emerging concept--that angiotensin is produced locally at tissue sites by an endogenous renin-angiotensin system--has important implications to our understanding of cardiovascular homeostasis. This concept implies that local angiotensin concentrations may exceed those of plasma levels and may play an important role in the tonic control of vascular resistance, cardiac and adrenal functions as well as local intrarenal events. An important mechanism of action of converting enzyme inhibitors may be the blockade of tissue angiotensin generation. Hence, the tissue distribution and kinetics of converting enzyme inhibitors may be an important determinant of drug action. These findings have led us to speculate that aberrant tissue renin, angiotensinogen gene expression(s) or abnormalities in the regulation of the local renin-angiotensin system may result in such cardiovascular disorders as vasospasm, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "62": "Calcium entry blockers appear to be effective antihypertensive agents in both young and older patients. Studies comparing diltiazem and placebo, diltiazem and propranolol, and diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide indicate that this calcium entry blocker is more effective than placebo, equally effective as the beta-adrenergic inhibitors at least in short-term studies, but not as effective in lowering systolic blood pressure (BP) when compared with hydrochlorothiazide (diastolic BP -11.5 mm Hg with diltiazem vs -12.2 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide; systolic BP -12.2 mm Hg with diltiazem vs -20.0 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide). Combination therapy with diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide proved effective in a high percentage of mono-therapy nonresponders. The most common adverse reactions to diltiazem included headaches, dizziness and edema. The exact place of calcium entry blockers in therapy as initial or step-2 therapy with a diuretic in hypertension must be determined by additional long-term experience in large numbers of patients.", 
    "63": "The effects of exercise on central hemodynamic mechanisms and the changes induced by treatment have been studied invasively in approximately 500 men with essential hypertension. In patients with mild hypertension, the increase in blood pressure (BP) during dynamic exercise is similar to that seen in normal subjects, but in patients with severe hypertension it is steeper. During dynamic exercise total peripheral resistance is increased in all categories of hypertensive patients, including young subjects with apparently \"normal\" resistance at rest. The increase in stroke volume in transition from rest to exercise is subnormal, probably reflecting increased stiffness in the left ventricle. Static exercise causes dramatic increase in systolic as well as diastolic BP. Most antihypertensive agents control BP similarly during exercise and at rest. The hemodynamic mechanisms, however, differ greatly. The beta blockers induce a long-term reduction in cardiac output, muscle blood flow and, frequently, endurance capacity. In contrast, alpha-receptor blockers, calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors all reduce total peripheral resistance and do not decrease blood flow. Increase in endurance time has been reported with long-term calcium antagonist treatment. It would seem logical to select an antihypertensive drug that does not reduce exercise capacity when treating physically active patients with mild and moderate hypertension.", 
    "64": "To a large degree, modern antihypertensive therapy has evolved from the development of agents that act as vasodilators but, for one reason or another, avoid the disadvantages of the nonspecific vasodilators. This review examines the impact of antihypertensive agents on renal perfusion and function and relates it to their efficacy in reducing high blood pressure. Special attention is given to beta-adrenergic blocking agents that have a minimal impact on the kidney, converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and dopamine analogs. Also reviewed are the functional abnormalities involving the renal blood supply in essential hypertension, the role of newer pharmacologic agents in therapy and the nature and extent of reactive responses that often limit the response to therapeutic agents.", 
    "65": "Human heart angiotensin-converting enzyme has been purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized N-[1(S)-carboxy-5-aminopentyl]-Gly-Gly. The isolation procedure permitted a 1650-fold-purified enzyme to be obtained. The specific activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme was 38 units per mg protein. The molecular weight of enzyme determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions was 150,000. The isoelectric point (5.3) of the enzyme was determined by chromatofocusing. The Km values of the enzyme for Bz-Gly-His-Leu and angiotensin I are 1.2 mM and 10 microM, respectively. Substrate inhibition of heart angiotensin-converting enzyme with a K's of 14 mM has been shown. The human heart enzyme is inhibited by SQ 20881 (IC50 = 40 nM). It was shown that NaCl, CaCl2 as well as Na2SO4 in the absence of Cl- are activators of the heart angiotensin-converting enzyme, whereas CH3COONa and NaNO3 have no effect on a catalytic activity of the enzyme.", 
    "66": "We describe a new principle for measuring concentrations of pharmacologically active captopril or other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in blood. Serum is incubated with 125I-labelled ACE inhibitor (351A, a p-hydroxy-benzamidine derivative of N-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline) in a nonequilibrated system, in which label and ACE inhibitor compete for binding to added serum ACE. Free label is separated by adsorption to coated charcoal. Sensitivity for captopril is 2 ng/ml, and for other tested ACE inhibitors 0.25-5 ng/ml. Results in healthy volunteers showed rapid absorption of captopril with maximal concentration of active drug within 1 h, and fast disappearance within 2.5 h. Stability of captopril was improved by immediate 1:100 dilution of blood samples with assay buffer. In spite of this precaution, analysis should be performed within two days to avoid loss of active drug due to polymerization and protein binding. Samples of other tested ACE inhibitors can be frozen and later analyzed at convenience. The new principle is simple, sensitive, and specific.", 
    "67": "We have previously shown that both bradykinin and lysylbradykinin are generated in nasal secretions upon nasal challenge of allergic individuals with appropriate allergen and have suggested that these potent pro-inflammatory peptides may contribute to the pathogenesis of the allergic response. In this study we used a variety of synthetic substrates together with both thin layer and high performance liquid chromatography systems to examine the metabolism of these peptides in nasal secretions obtained by lavage. We now demonstrate that in addition to low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, nasal lavages contain an aminopeptidase activity that converts lysylbradykinin to bradykinin, and a carboxypeptidase that removes the C-terminal arginine from bradykinin and lysylbradykinin. The levels of all these activities are significantly increased after allergen challenge of allergic, but not nonallergic, individuals. The aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities present in post-challenge lavages from allergic individuals convert lysylbradykinin to intermediate products (bradykinin and des (Arg10) lysylbradykinin) and eventually to des (Arg9) bradykinin. The nasal carboxypeptidase was activated 475% by 0.1 mM CoCl2 and was inhibited by the carboxypeptidase N inhibitor, MERGETPA (D-L-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid) (IC50 = 10 microM). The aminopeptidase activity was not affected by MERGETPA but was potently inhibited by amastatin and bestatin (IC50 = 0.05 microM and 3.0 microM, respectively). The activity of the aminopeptidase against its synthetic substrate was also inhibited by lysylbradykinin (IC50 = 50 microM). Both the carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase activities had neutral pH optima and were inhibited by o-phenanthroline, but were unaffected by inhibitors of neutral endopeptidases (phosphoramidon) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (Captopril). The Km of bradykinin for the nasal carboxypeptidase was 139 +/- 14 microM (n = 3). We conclude that during the allergic response, nasal secretions contain aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities that convert lysylbradykinin and bradykinin (B2 agonists) to des (Arg9) bradykinin (a B1 agonist). Because the nature of the kinin receptors in the nasal mucosa are currently unknown, it remains to be determined whether this metabolism results in the termination of biologic activity or the production of a biologically active moiety.", 
    "68": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor 2-[N-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-(1S,3S,5S)-2- -azabicyclo(3.3.0)octane-3-carboxylic acid (Hoe 498 diacid) and the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin on antinociception induced in rats by intraventricular injections of [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 and [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 was investigated. Potentiation and prolongation of the antinociception was observed after pretreatment with bestatin. Further potentiation of the antinociception elicited by the heptapeptide was obtained in rats pretreated with a combination of bestatin and Hoe 498 diacid. In contrast, antinociception elicited by the octapeptide was not potentiated further by pretreatment with the bestatin and Hoe 498 diacid combination.", 
    "69": "A randomized, parallel group study evaluated the safety, efficacy, and effect of the alpha blocking agent prazosin and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on serum lipid levels in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Baseline evaluations were performed on 31 patients after a four-week placebo washout period. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either prazosin (n = 15) or captopril (n = 16). Daily doses were titrated as follows: for prazosin, 1 mg two times daily to maximum of 20 mg per day; for captopril, 25 mg three times daily to a maximum of 450 mg per day. If diastolic blood pressure was not adequately controlled (less than 85 mm Hg) after four weeks of monotherapy, 1 mg of polythiazide was added to the daily regimen. There were no statistically significant differences between the drug groups for the measured variables in either the parallel or crossover phase of the study. Five of 15 prazosin-treated patients and six of 16 captopril-treated patients required the addition of thiazide to achieve blood pressure control.", 
    "70": "The activity of three angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with unique related structures was assessed in vitro and in vivo. The three compounds were (S)(-)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxylic acid (EU-4865), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-1- isoquinolinecarboxylic acid (EU-4881), and (S)(-)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-2- quinolinecarboxylic acid (EU-5031). In vitro EU-4881 was a competitive inhibitor that lacked potency (IC50 = 1980 nM) against purified ACE. The other two compounds were equipotent (IC50 = 41 nM) against purified ACE but differed in their inhibition kinetics. EU-4865 (Ki = 38 nM) was a noncompetitive inhibitor, and EU-5031 (Ki = 6.9 nM) was a competitive inhibitor. Against caveolae membrane-bound ACE EU-4881 also lacked potency (IC50 = 2852 nM). In vivo in the conscious acute aortic coarctate (AAC) rat it also lacked potency, having an ED30 (oral dose decreasing blood pressure 30 mmHg) greater than 100 mg/kg. The activity of EU-4865 and EU-5031 in the caveolae membrane-bound ACE and AAC rat reflected their different Ki values rather than their similar IC50 values. In vitro, EU-4865 and EU-5031 had IC50 values of 19 and 6.7 nM, respectively, and in vivo, they had ED30 values of 52 and 1.1 mg/kg, respectively. These results suggest that ACE has a binding requirement for a carboxy-terminus, hydrophobic amino acid that is important for in vivo activity.", 
    "71": "The primary hemodynamic hallmark of essential hypertension is elevated systemic vascular resistance that may be affected by increased sympathetic tone, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, or structural and cellular abnormalities (e.g., those involving calcium) of the blood vessel wall. The aim of therapy, therefore, is to reduce vascular tone through the use of a specific blocker of neurohormonal mechanisms or a nonspecific vasodilator. These agents are not equally effective in all patients. In comparing these drugs, the following issues are important: pathophysiology, patient demography, mechanism of drug action, long-term efficacy, and metabolic effects. Several studies have suggested that there is a response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in young and middle-aged patients, whereas in elderly patients there may be more of a response to calcium channel blockers. Alpha 1-adrenergic blockers, however, appear to be effective in all age groups. Calcium channel blockers and alpha 1-adrenergic blockers generally are more effective in black patients than are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Neither of these agents adversely affects serum potassium, glucose, or plasma lipid levels. In fact, data suggest that alpha 1-adrenergic blockers may reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Unlike alpha-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers may produce a negative inotropic effect and improved cardiac diastolic relaxation. In addition to all of these factors, it is important that the agent selected as initial antihypertensive therapy be efficacious, have a favorable side-effects profile, and have no adverse influences on other risk factors.", 
    "72": "The pharmacokinetics and depressor effect of a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, delapril, was assessed by administering a single dose of 30 mg to nine patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Orally administered delapril is a prodrug and must be deesterified to its active metabolites, delapril diacid and 5-hydroxy delapril diacid. The pharmacokinetic parameters for delapril, delapril diacid, and 5-hydroxy delapril diacid were, respectively: t 1/2 0.30, 1.21, and 1.40 hours; Cmax 489, 635, and 229 ng/ml; AUC 572, 1859, and 948 ng X hr/ml. Delapril produced significant decreases in systolic blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity 24 hours after dosing. There were no significant changes in the endogeneous creatinine clearance after the drug. Thus delapril may represent a useful antihypertensive agent for control of blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "73": "Hypertensive emergencies are defined as conditions where a seriously elevated blood pressure imposes a substantial threat to a patient's life or vital organ functions. Since acute blood pressure reduction by lowering cardiac output and/or vascular resistance itself has the potential for serious and even life-threatening complications, treatment should be given restrictively based on pathophysiological considerations concerning altered patterns of blood pressure and blood flow regulation in these patients. Ischemic treatment related complications can be avoided by a rational choice of first-line drugs. These include beta-blockers for patients with a compromised myocardial oxygen supply as in acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina as well as for patients with dissecting aneurysms and patients with pronounced catecholamine release. In other types of hypertensive emergencies, calcium antagonists have emerged as the treatment of choice with excellent efficacy and a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Sodium nitroprusside is rarely necessary in treatment failures after calcium channel blockade.", 
    "74": "Severity of hypertension may be defined in terms of the height of the arterial pressure, or the degree of organ damage present or the resistance to drug therapy. These definitions do not necessarily overlap in the individual case. A variety of drugs is now available for treatment of the severe case however defined, but results of current treatment of such cases in practice have not reduced the risk of stroke or of myocardial infarction to that of the age- and sex-matched normotensive population. Data from which to select drugs with favourable effects on left ventricular hypertrophy, glomerular hyperfiltration or the cerebral circulation are scanty and need amplification. Choice of drug therapy in current circumstances remains empirical, although there are probable advantages in the use of converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists in the treatment of severe hypertension.", 
    "75": "The aging heart differs in several aspects from the heart in younger people: Cardiac muscle mass, systolic and diastolic wall stress increase, the velocity of electrical conduction decreases in different anatomical structures. Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias appear more frequently than in younger people. Heart rate and cardiac index tend to diminish, especially under work load. Work capacity is reduced. In the treatment of coronary heart disease drugs are preferred which lead to a reduction of preload. Nitrates and molsidomine are followed by calcium channel blockers and--afterwards--by beta-blockers. Bypass surgery is performed in elderly patients more often for therapeutical than for prognostic reasons, similarly in the case of valvular surgery. Typical tachyarrhythmias are treated only in case of hemodynamic relevance, whereas pacemaker therapy is not limited by greater age. The choice of the most suitable pacemaker model, however, has to be based upon the overall circumstances in each individual case. For the treatment of congestive heart failure, vasodilators, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, seem to be superior, in elderly patients, to diuretics and digitalis glycosides.", 
    "76": "An open, randomized, multicentre, comparative trial on 2128 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, treated with so-called perceived best therapy or a combination of captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), was conducted over a period of 10 weeks. Both regimens lead to significant blood pressure reductions within the initial 6 weeks, with a difference of 3 mmHg systolic and 2 mmHg diastolic in favour of the captopril plus HCTZ regimen as compared to the perceived best therapy. Both an increase in the daily dose of captopril in uncontrolled patients receiving initial treatment with captopril plus HCTZ and treatment with captopril plus HCTZ in uncontrolled patients receiving the perceived best therapy was followed by improved blood pressure control. There were more withdrawals mainly due to side effects and non-compliance in the captopril plus HCTZ group as compared to the perceived best therapy group. By contrast, there were fewer side effects and a tendency towards a more pronounced improvement of complaints and general well-being in the captopril plus HCTZ group. The study has yielded no clear evidence of an increased number of side effects known to be associated with captopril. Changes of the treatment regimen and dosages according to diastolic blood pressure during the study are difficult to achieve in a study of this type and size.", 
    "77": "Two hundred and eleven patients with mild or moderate hypertension, mean age 53.5 +/- 9.5 years (range 24-70) were randomised double-blind to treatment with either captopril 50 mg (C50), hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (HCTZ 25), the fixed combination of captopril 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (C50/HCTZ 25) or placebo. Blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and side effects were assessed at the end of the run-in period on placebo and after 4, 6, 8 weeks treatment at the same time, 20-24 h after the last dosing. Routine biochemical examinations were carried out on all patients after the placebo period as well as after 4 and 8 weeks. Blood pressure significantly decreased in all groups, but the mean percentage change from baseline was highly statistically significant at 8 weeks, for C50 and C50/HCTZ 25 groups. The incidence of clinical side effects was low and not statistically different for the four groups with few specific adverse effects (one transient alteration of taste in captopril group). No patient was withdrawn from the study due to side effects. A better anti-hypertensive efficacy was obtained with the fixed combination captopril 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily compared to placebo or each component alone, and without any difference in side effects.", 
    "78": "The hypotensive effect of captopril 50 mg twice daily and of captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once daily was studied in 12 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, whose blood pressure was not normalized by captopril 25 mg twice daily alone. Both captopril 50 mg twice daily and captopril 50 mg + HCTZ 25 mg once daily caused a significant reduction of outpatient blood pressures as compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Captopril 50 mg + HCTZ 25 mg once daily also reduced outpatient blood pressures significantly when compared with captopril 25 mg twice daily (P less than 0.01). Both captopril 50 mg twice daily and captopril 50 mg + HCTZ 25 mg once daily significantly reduced 24 h blood pressure (P less than 0.001) without disturbance of its normal circadian rhythm. This effect was more pronounced while on captopril + HCTZ. Captopril 50 mg + HCTZ 25 mg once daily normalizes 24 h blood pressure in most patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, whose blood pressure is not controlled by captopril 25 mg twice daily alone.", 
    "79": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate over a 24 h period the antihypertensive effect of captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once a day in mild to moderate hypertension. Ambulatory recordings over 24 h of the blood pressure using the Spacelabs system were performed, at the end of a 15-day placebo period and after giving captopril + HCTZ for 45 days. Captopril + HCTZ significantly decreased (P less than 0.001) systolic and diastolic blood pressures for both the diurnal period (8 h to 22 h) and the nocturnal period (22 h to 8 h). No change in heart rate was observed. For further analysis, the mean hour values of blood pressure and heart rate were calculated. A constant decrease of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the 24 h was obtained after captopril + HCTZ without any change in heart rate and in nyctohemeral variations. The study provided evidence that, in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, captopril + HCTZ once a day decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure all day long without any change in the heart rate and the blood pressure nyctohemeral cycle.", 
    "80": "The anti-hypertensive effect of captopril 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, given once or twice daily, was investigated by 24 h monitoring in hypertensive patients in a controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial. Ten patients with blood pressure (BP) greater than 160 and/or 95 mm Hg after a 15 day placebo period, were randomly assigned to one of two treatments, in which they either received the combination once daily in the first month, twice daily in the second and once daily in the third (Treatment Group A) or twice daily in the first month, once daily in the second month and twice daily in the third month (Treatment Group B). The anti-hypertensive effect of the drug combination was assessed by 24 h monitoring using a Dinamap 845 to establish mean BP levels and circadian curves. After 1 month the twice daily administration was more effective than the once daily, but after 2 months, and throughout the third month, there was no difference in the anti-hypertensive efficacy of the combination given either once or twice daily.", 
    "81": "A multicentre controlled trial was carried out to determine the optimal dosage of a 2/1 combination of captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in mild hypertension at three doses against placebo in a 6 week double-blind trial. The number of patients was 111:27 received placebo; 26 were treated with captopril 25 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg (25/12.5); 25 with captopril 50 mg plus HCTZ 25 mg (50/25); and 33 with captopril 100 mg plus HCTZ 50 mg (100/50). A significant fall in blood pressure was seen in all four groups, but was greater with the active treatments. The percentage of patients who were normalized [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than or equal to 90 mm Hg] or good responders (10% fall in DBP) increased as a function of the dose. At Day 21, the antihypertensive effect of 50/25 was similar to that of 100/50, but greater than that of captopril 25-HCTZ 12.5. At Day 42, the antihypertensive effects of the three doses were similar. Tolerance data showed a higher incidence of side-effects with 100/50 than with the other dosages. Thus, 50/25 appeared to be the optimal dosage for the control of mild hypertension.", 
    "82": "The results of controlled clinical studies have shown that about 80% of hypertensive patients have a satisfactory blood pressure reduction when treated with a combination of captopril and thiazide diuretics. The high response rate to this treatment can be explained on the basis of the mechanism of action of these drugs. In the long term, diuretics act by reducing peripheral vascular resistance. The mechanism by which they reduce peripheral vascular resistance is the subject of debate, but could be explained on the basis of cellular ionic changes. From our studies, it was observed that thiazides cause a reduction in intracellular Na+ (Nai) and in intra- and extracellular K+ (Ki, Ke). Since in many patients Ke losses are greater than Ki losses, the Ki/Ke ratio (which is directly related to membrane potential and thus to vascular tone) increases. Captopril also reduces Nai, but its effects on Ke and Ki are quite different from those of thiazides. Captopril in fact causes an increase in Ki inducing a net increase in Ki/Ke. This increase can also be observed when captopril is given in combination with thiazides. Therefore the combination of captopril and thiazides has an additive effect on Nai, and increases Ki/Ke in the vast majority of patients. The decrease in Nai probably acts by reducing membrane sensitivity to catecholamines and angiotensin, whereas the increase in Ki/Ke acts by hyperpolarizing vascular smooth muscle membrane. The combination of captopril an thiazides also has favourable metabolic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "83": "Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is higher in treated hypertensive patients than in normotensive subjects of the same age, sex and from the same populations. A possible and logical explanation for this could be that arterial pressure in treated hypertensive patients usually is significantly higher than in matched normotensive subjects. For these reasons it would appear logical to identify a therapeutic goal in the treatment of hypertension: to obtain normotensive blood pressure levels. In order to obtain this goal, combined treatment with more than one antihypertensive drug would appear to be required. Therapeutic combinations consisting of an ACE-inhibitor plus a diuretic or an ACE-inhibitor plus a calcium antagonist constitute two examples of antihypertensive drug combinations that would appear to offer potent antihypertensive efficacy and good tolerability.", 
    "84": "Interaction between kininase II and anaesthesia is not well described. Twenty two patients treated by kininase II for congestive heart failure are studied during anaesthesia for cardiovascular surgery. A first group of seventeen homogeneous hemodynamic data are reported. High cardiac index contrasts with severe clinical cardiac failure. A second group of inhomogeneous patients are separately described. Vasoconstrictor can be codified in the situation of low systemic resistance with high cardiac index. Preoperative treatment can be continued, under requirement of hemodynamic monitoring.", 
    "85": "The effects of angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) on ring segments of femoral arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were studied. AI and AII elicited significantly greater direct contractile response in arteries from SHR than those from WKY. These peptides also potentiated the contractile response to transmural adrenergic nerve stimulation (TNS) in both preparations, but to a greater extent in those of WKY than SHR, without potentiating the contractile response to exogenous norepinephrine (NE). The potentiation of the TNS response and direct contraction caused by AI were markedly attenuated by captopril, an AI-converting enzyme inhibitor. Destruction of endothelium failed to alter the contractile response to AI in both WKY and SHR but augmented that to AII in WKY. Isoproterenol and salbutamol produced significant potentiation of TNS response only in arteries of SHR. Yohimbine and prostaglandin F2 alpha potentiated TNS response to a similar extent in arteries of WKY and SHR. These results suggest that AII locally generated from AI can act postsynaptically to cause contraction and presynaptically to promote adrenergic neurotransmission in the isolated rat femoral artery. The AI to AII conversion appears to take place mainly at sites other than endothelial cells. The postsynaptic effect of AII is greater in SHR than WKY, but its presynaptic effect is diminished in SHR unlike some other agents which facilitate adrenergic neurotransmission, and unlike that in mesenteric arteries of SHR.", 
    "86": "An isolated perfused kidney system (IPK) was used to study the direct intrarenal hemodynamic effects of binding of anti-glomerular-basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody in the absence of all other circulating humoral and cellular inflammatory mediators. Control IPK's (perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffered 5% albumin solution containing non-immune globulin) had a renal vascular resistance (RVR) mean +/- SEM 3.10 +/- 0.47 mm Hg/ml/min and a GFR mean +/- SEM 0.63 +/- 0.8 ml/min/g. Anti-GBM antibody administration raised RVR (4.83 +/- 0.52 mm Hg/ml/min, P less than 0.01) and lowered GFR (0.34 +/- 0.04 ml/min/g, P less than 0.01). Perfusate renin activity was higher after antibody administration (684 +/- 87 ng AI/ml/hr compared with control 308 +/- 42 ngAI/ml/hr, P less than 0.01). Treatment with Sar1Ala8All (3 X 10(-6) M) or captopril (10 mg/ml) attenuated antibody-induced vasoconstriction (RVR mm Hg/ml/min, Sara1Ala8All = 3.78 +/- 0.13 captopril = 3.26 +/- 0.12, both P less than 0.05 compared with anti-GBM alone). Both inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) also aggrevated the decline in GFR seen after antibody administration (GFR ml/min/g, Sara1Ala8All = 0.24 +/- 0.05, Captopril = 0.18 +/- 0.03, both P less than 0.05 compared with anti-GBM alone). These IPK studies demonstrate that anti-GBM antibody itself may directly induce intrarenal hemodynamic alterations in the absence of complement activation, neutrophil infiltration, neural influences or circulating vasoactive substances. The results from perfusate renin sampling and blockade of the RAS provide evidence that anti-GBM antibody deposition activates the intrarenal RAS and thereby induces significant hemodynamic alterations.", 
    "87": "Furosemide increases sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) excretion but if dietary salt is provided, a compensatory reduction in Na+ and K+ excretion follows which restores neutral balances within 18 to 24 hours. This compensation is not interrupted by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAA) alone with captopril. Since plasma norepinephrine concentration increases after furosemide and alpha 1 adrenoreceptors can mediate enhanced Na+ reabsorption, we administered prazosin (2 mg 6 hr-1) to six normal volunteers consuming a daily intake of 270 mmol of Na+ and 75 mmol of K+, and added captopril (25 mg 6 hr-1) for an additional day to block the RAA system concurrently. Furosemide (40 mg day-1) was given for the last four days. Prazosin given alone before the diuretic reduced (P less than 0.05) BP and plasma angiotensin II (AII) concentration and increased body weight and heart rate. However, when given with furosemide, neither prazosin nor prazosin with captopril modified the short-term natriuretic or kaliuretic responses to furosemide, or the ensuing compensatory reductions in Na+ and K+ excretion. Accordingly, cumulative balances for Na+ and K+ remained neutral over four days of diuretic administration. Neither drug altered the renal responsiveness to the diuretic which was assessed from the relationship between renal Na+ and K+ excretion and diuretic elimination. Although the BP was maintained when furosemide was given alone, when given with prazosin and captopril, the mean BP fell by 13 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Captopril (C) causes ARF in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) with a single functioning kidney (SK). Retrospective studies in two patients showed that episodes of C-induced ARF were preceded by a rise in urinary Na+ excretion and a rapid decrease in body weight. These observations prompted us to investigate whether extracellular fluid volume depletion secondary to C-induced natriuresis can be responsible for ARF. Prospective studies were performed in four patients with RAS-SK treated with C. These studies have shown that: ARF is associated with negative Na+ balance and is corrected by salt replacement, even without interrupting C; ARF is preceded by a rise in urinary prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-F1 alpha; ARF is prevented by either saline infusion or aspirin administration; ARF does not occur when the dose of C is not sufficient to raise PGs and urinary N + excretion. We conclude therefore that C-induced ARF in patients with RAS-SK can be secondary to salt depletion dependent on a raised secretion of PGs.", 
    "89": "The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which vasopressin or the renin-angiotensin system contributed to the recovery of blood pressure following acute hypotension induced by treatment with pentolinium and captopril, or pentolinium and the vasopressin antagonist d(CH2)5DAVP, respectively, in conscious, free-moving rats treated 21 days previously with saline or streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg ip). Half the animals given STZ were subsequently treated with insulin (about 4.5 U/day). The STZ-treated animals demonstrated a resting bradycardia and systolic hypotension. The vasopressin-mediated recovery in blood pressure seen following administration of pentolinium, in the presence of captopril, and the renin-angiotensin-mediated recovery seen following administration of pentolinium, in the presence of d(CH2)5DAVP, were both found to be significantly (P less than 0.05) attenuated in the STZ-treated animals. These abnormalities were absent in the animals injected with STZ and treated daily with insulin, but receiving their last dose 24 h before measurement. At that time the animals had elevated blood glucoses. These results indicate that the abnormalities observed were not due to toxic effects of STZ or to hyperglycemia per se.", 
    "90": "To determine whether the hemodynamic profile of chronic heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction could be altered, captopril was administered to female Wistar rats 3 weeks after coronary artery ligation and continued for 3 months. Captopril reduced left ventricular mass, prevented the increase in right ventricular mass observed with increasing infarct size, lessened the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance, whereas cardiac output and heart rate were maintained. The end-diastolic volume of treated rats with moderate infarcts was significantly less than that of untreated rats, and therefore the ejection fraction index was significantly increased. In rats given captopril until death or for a period of up to 1 year, survival was significantly prolonged, particularly in those rats with moderate-sized infarcts.", 
    "91": "SCH 33861 is a novel, non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Topical administration of the compound to the eye of conscious rabbits was employed to examine actions on intraocular pressure (IOP). Falls in IOP resulted from SCH 33861 (0.001-0.01%) administration. Ocular hypotensive responses were sustained for as long as 24 hrs following a single application of 0.001% SCH 33861. The RSS isomer of SCH 33861, which is 200-fold weaker an ACE inhibitor than SCH 33861, caused only transient falls in IOP at 0.1% concentration. The magnitude of the fall in IOP induced by 0.001% SCH 33861 (4.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg) was comparable to that produced by 0.5% timolol (4.5 +/- 0.3 mmHg). Other ACE inhibitors such as captopril (0.1%) and enalaprilic acid (0.01%) also reduced IOP by 4.0 +/- 0.4 and 4.7 +/- 0.4 mmHg, respectively. These findings indicate that SCH 33861 is 500-fold more potent on a weight basis than is timolol in lowering IOP. No loss of ocular hypotensive activity was observed when SCH 33861 was administered twice daily for 5 days suggesting little, if any, potential for tolerance development. SCH 33861, as well as the other ACE inhibitors, caused neither ocular irritation nor alteration of pupil diameter. These findings suggest that inhibition of ocular ACE may represent an effective means of reducing IOP.", 
    "92": "The calcium antagonist, felodipine, was used to treat 21 patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension: 13 had renoparenchymatous hypertension, 5 essential hypertension and 3 renovascular hypertension. Mean arterial blood pressure of patients was 195 +/- 8/122 +/- 3mm Hg in spite of treatment with 3 or more antihypertensive drugs. The majority of the patients (n = 17) were treated with an ACE inhibitor. Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for 20 patients was 39 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73m2 body surface area (Cr-EDTA clearance) before felodipine administration. All patients had an immediate blood pressure fall after 5-10mg of felodipine administered orally. This fall persisted when the drug was given 2 or 3 times daily in combination with previous medication except the former vasodilating drugs. 15 patients are on long term treatment with felodipine and their blood pressure after 1 year (n = 14) was 152 +/- 4/89 +/- 2mm Hg. Patients with moderately impaired renal function and no signs of progressive kidney disease (n = 8) improved their GFR significantly after 1 year on felodipine. Six patients stopped felodipine therapy within 3 months (4 because of adverse reactions, 1 died of scleroderma and 1 became normotensive after the start of dialysis treatment). In patients with renoparenchymatous disease and documented progressive deterioration of renal function the addition of felodipine did not prevent a decline in filtration rate but did slow the rate of deterioration (from 9 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 1 ml/min/year).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "93": "Elderly patients have a higher incidence of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias and greater management problems than younger patients. This is due to the frequency of occult and overt cardiovascular disease, reduction in cardiac reserve as a consequence of the aging process, and coexistence of other disorders which provide a substrate for iatrogenic disease. The last problem is largely due to electrolyte disturbances induced by diuretic therapy for hypertension and heart failure. The major electrolyte disturbance implicated in arrhythmogenesis is diuretic-induced hypokalemia. There is no doubt that arrhythmias are caused by severe hypokalemia (less than 2.5 mEq/l), or by a milder degree of hypokalemia in digitalis-treated patients or those with left ventricular hypertrophy, but the literature contains conflicting data regarding the importance of milder hypokalemia. The most compelling study in support of its importance used a crossover study design in hypertensive patients with coronary disease and showed that mild degrees of hypokalemia induced by thiazide diuretics increased the tendency to arrhythmia when compared with normokalemia on a potassium-sparing diuretic. Diuretic-induced magnesium deficiency is also regarded by some to be as important as hypokalemia, but the evidence is less extensive. Thus, it appears reasonable to avoid hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The optimum therapeutic approach in using diuretics is to keep the dose as low as possible, restrict dietary sodium, and add potassium supplements. Since, in many cases of hypertension, hypokalemia is due to secondary hyperaldosteronism, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is another therapeutic approach that is effective in hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "94": "The effects of 4 angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), captopril, enalapril, ramipril, and trandolapril, were investigated on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF, radioactive microspheres) distribution in ischemic and nonischemic zones and on ST-segment elevation in ischemic zones during intermittent coronary artery occlusion in anesthetized dogs. The 4 ACEI inhibited plasma ACE activity to an almost similar extent. All similarly reduced systemic blood pressure, an effect related to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Heart rate and myocardial contractility were not affected, but myocardial oxygen consumption presumably decreased because of the reduction in afterload. RMBF and their distribution (between epicardial and endocardial layers and between nonischemic and ischemic zones) were not modified by ACEI. Coronary vascular resistance was slightly decreased in nonischemic zones. ACEI had no effect on ST-segment elevation in ischemic zones. Thus, in this experimental model, all ACEI exhibited the same profile, including no change in RMBF and affording no protection against ischemic injury.", 
    "95": "Previous studies of the renal kallikrein-kinin system in chronic renal failure (CRF) have given conflicting results. We have assessed activity of this vasoactive hormone system in CRF and investigated a possible relationship to hypertension in patients with CRF: 24-hour urinary kallikrein excretion (UKa) was measured in 22 patients with CRF (9 normotensive and 13 hypertensive) and 11 healthy controls. Age, sex, urine volume, and urinary sodium excretion were similar in each group. Compared with controls, UKa was reduced in both normotensive and hypertensive patients with CRF, with no difference between CRF groups. The reduction in UKa in CRF was less than the reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as assessed by endogenous creatinine clearance (CCr). When UKa was divided by CCr, UKa/mL CCr was therefore increased, to a similar extent, in both normotensive and hypertensive patients with CRF. This suggests that release of renal kallikrein from functioning nephrons is increased in CRF. The results do not support a role for deficient kallikrein release in the genesis of hypertension in CRF, as previously suggested; however, these abnormalities could be relevant to other aspects of renal function in CRF. The converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was given to 5 patients with CRF, hypertension, and low UKa. Introduction of captopril was followed by a further reduction in UKa in all subjects. Captopril is known to inhibit kininase II, the principal enzyme involved in degradation of kinins; this potentiating effect may be counteracted by a reduction in renal kallikrein release and hence in kinin generation.", 
    "96": "Increasing doses of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (5, 10, 20, 40, 60 ng/kg/min) were infused in 7 normal volunteers before and after angiotensin II synthesis inhibition by captopril (100 mg by mouth). PGE2 infusion alone did not alter blood pressure, while it increased the urinary excretion of both epinephrine and norepinephrine, enhanced p-aminohyppuric clearance (CPAH), inulin clearance (CIn), sodium and water excretion and decreased urinary osmolality. No changes of CIn, CPAH and catecholamines were observed after captopril alone, whilst there was a significant increase in urine output and sodium excretion and a decrease in urinary osmolality. In the presence of captopril, the infusion of PGE2 caused a significant fall in blood pressure and CIn, enhanced epinephrine excretion and sodium excretion, while it did not significantly reduce CPAH. Our findings suggest that an intact renin-angiotensin system is necessary to maintain GFR during PGE2 infusion.", 
    "97": "We investigated the effects of local angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril on the autoregulatory efficiency of glomerular blood flow (GBF). The microvasculature of the nonfiltering rat kidney was observed via in vivo television microscopy. Clamping of the aorta above the renal arteries allowed controlled reductions in renal perfusion pressure. Perfusion pressure reductions (PPR) dilated preglomerular vessels and, within the autoregulatory range, GBF was well maintained. Local captopril application markedly attenuated pressure dependent vasodilation and abolished autoregulation of GBF. Autoregulatory response could be restored in the presence of captopril by adding angiotensin II (A II) to the tissue bath. These results indicate that autoregulation of GBF in the rat kidney is, at least partially, dependent on intrarenal renin-angiotensin activity.", 
    "98": "Experiments were conducted in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs to investigate the effects of captopril on sympathetic neuronal control of the heart and hindlimb vasculature. Captopril, 3.1 mg/kg, i.v. produced marked reductions in blood pressure and hindlimb perfusion pressure, an observation consistent with the high plasma renin activity in the test animals. Increments in hindlimb perfusion pressure elicited by electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic chain were also significantly reduced following captopril administration (p less than .002). The subsequent administration of a ten fold higher dose of captopril, 31.0 mg/kg, produced no further attenuation of the neurally mediated responses. In contrast to the decreased vascular responses to nerve stimulation after captopril, the tachycardia produced by stimulation of pre- or post-ganglionic neurons to the stellate ganglion were not altered. The results of the present study suggest that captopril acts by inhibiting vascular sympathetic neuronal function when the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is elevated. The attenuation of neurally mediated vasoconstriction may be due to the interruption of angiotensin II formation, thereby, preventing the facilitatory effects of angiotensin on sympathetic neurons.", 
    "99": "The role of circulating bradykinin in blood pressure regulation was investigated in conscious normotensive rats using a competitive antagonist of bradykinin. The acute blood pressure effect of this antagonist was also evaluated after inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with captopril and during simultaneous infusion of exogenous angiotensin II. No evidence was found for a role of circulating bradykinin in rats studied under normal conditions. Endogenous bradykinin seemed however involved in blood pressure control during angiotensin II infusion. Acute angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition had no influence on the blood pressure response to the bradykinin antagonist.", 
    "100": "The antihypertensive efficacy of ACE inhibitors depends in theory from the blockade of the angiotensin II formation but also from the inhibition of kinin breakdown. To test whether a blunted activity of the kallikrein-kinin system might account for the failure of ACE inhibitors in lowering BP in patients in whom the renin-angiotensin system is not enhanced, thirty-one essential hypertensives with normal or low PRA were evaluated before and after a single oral dose (50 mg) of captopril. A significant fall both in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) was obtained in the subgroup of patients who were classified as \"normal kallikrein hypertensives\" according to whether their pretreatment urinary kallikrein excretion was within the normal range, while no significant change in BP was observed in \"low kallikrein hypertensives\". Furthermore the mean percentage fall in mean BP, throughout the 2 hours following captopril administration, was significantly related to the basal value of urinary kallikrein excretion (r = 0.47, p less than 0.05) in the entire group of patients. Our results suggest that a blunted activity of the kallikrein system might be responsible for failure of captopril in lowering BP in patients in whom the renin-angiotensin system is not pathogenetically implicated.", 
    "101": "The effect of furosemide (40 mg iv) on diuresis, natriuresis and renal kallikrein and kinin excretion was investigated without and with pretreatment by captopril (100 mg po). Furosemide stimulated markedly diuresis and natriuresis as well as urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion. Pretreatment by captopril (C) reduced the diuretic and natriuretic effect of furosemide significantly (UNaV pre-C: +15, 1 +/- 2.1 ml/min vs. post-C: 7.0 +/- 0.3 ml/min; p less than 0.001). Similar changes in urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion were observed after captopril pretreatment, but because of the great coefficient of variation these changes did not reach statistical significance. The reason for the reduced activity of furosemide after captopril pretreatment was the diminished proximal-tubular secretion of furosemide, as it could be shown by direct measurement of the drug in urine. After furosemide injection changes in plasma aldosterone concentration paralleled changes in renal kallikrein and kinin excretion. However, after captopril there was a sharp dissociation between aldosterone, which was diminished by captopril continuously, and renal kallikrein and kinins, which were still stimulated by furosemide. These results suggest that renal kallikrein-kinin system is stimulated by furosemide directly and independently of aldosterone secretion.", 
    "102": "Dietary sodium deprivation lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, while indomethacin induced a rise in blood pressure with significant decreases in plasma angiotensin II concentration and urinary excretion of sodium and PGE. In contrast, captopril lowered blood pressure in them with significant decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentration and significant increase in urinary excretion of sodium and PGE. These data strongly indicate that the decreased PG generation in the nephron could elevate blood pressure by means of sodium retention caused by the reduced renal excretory function in spite of the decreased R-A system in human, suggesting the involvement of renal tubular PGE2 in the regulation of blood pressure.", 
    "103": "Previous work in this and other laboratories has demonstrated that captopril exacerbates the hypotension produced in dogs by endotoxin. This depressor effect of captopril could result from the potentiation of bradykinin (BK) or inhibited formation of angiotensin II (AII). Anesthetized adult mongrel dogs were used in the current study. In each, the right femoral vein and artery were cannulated for the administration of drugs and monitoring of arterial pressure. A tracheostomy was performed, and the animal was respired with room air. It was found that after injection of endotoxin, AII receptor blockade (Sar1, Ile8-AII) produced a mean arterial pressure (MAP) response statistically similar to that elicited by captopril in combination with endotoxin. Although these results indicate no production of BK, the possibility of BK receptor inactivation during endotoxin shock cannot be disregarded. Additional studies suggested that in the dog, injections of BK can augment the depression of MAP caused by endotoxin and that this further depression can be prolonged by captopril. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that in the early phases of canine endotoxin shock, AII plays a significant role in the maintenance of MAP and that BK is not produced in quantities sufficient to lower MAP.", 
    "104": "In hepatic cirrhosis neurohumoral vasoconstrictor systems are activated to compensate for circulatory disturbances. To study the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in more detail, angiotensin converting enzyme in 15 patients with advanced liver disease was inhibited with captopril after moderate sodium restriction. Captopril caused an increase in plasma renin activity (p less than 0.005) and a decrease in plasma aldosterone (p less than 0.025) from an elevated baseline, and a moderate drop in systolic (p less than 0.025) and diastolic (p less than 0.05) blood pressure. Hyperreninaemia after captopril was inversely related to the prevailing plasma sodium level (r = -0.66, p less than 0.01), and the changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were correlated with baseline plasma renin activity (r = 0.49, p less than 0.05 for systolic and r = 0.71, p less than 0.01 for diastolic blood pressure). No change occurred in heart rate or in stimulated plasma noradrenaline and vasopressin levels. The data suggest that in these cirrhotic patients the reactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was still intact, although it occurred at a higher level. They confirm the importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in arterial blood pressure regulation in cirrhosis.", 
    "105": "In renal artery stenosis activation of the renin-angiotensin system elevates blood pressure by direct peripheral effects and probably through stimulation of sympathetic activity, which can be induced by angiotensin-II either centrally or peripherally. In animals specific brain lesions and afferent renal denervation can either attenuate or prevent renovascular hypertension. We investigated the neurogenic mechanisms responsible for hypertension in 21 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis off drug therapy, by studying the cardiovascular and hormonal effects of Clonidine. The responses to Captopril served as an indicator of the peripheral effects of angiotensin-II. Both oral and intravenous Clonidine lowered blood pressure substantially and for a prolonged period even in patients who had been refractory to multiple antihypertensive drug therapy. Levels of plasma renin activity were unchanged after Clonidine. Plasma noradrenaline levels fell. Pressor responses to infused angiotensin-II were not reduced. These data suggest that Clonidine lowers blood pressure independently of hormonal and peripheral vascular interactions and is consistent with its predominantly central sympatholytic effects. Oral Captopril, unlike Clonidine, had variable hypotensive effects directly related to the basal level of plasma renin activity. The largest reductions were observed in those with the highest level of renin. Our studies indicate that neurogenic mechanisms, probably centrally mediated, have an important and often major role in maintaining hypertension in human renal artery stenosis. These may result from the central effects of angiotensin-II, and/or from increased afferent renal nerve activity, as demonstrated experimentally. The neurogenic components maintaining hypertension in renal artery stenosis are largely dependent on renal ischaemia as revascularisation (by surgery or angioplasty) or nephrectomy, either ameliorates or cures the hypertension in the majority of our patients.", 
    "106": "Active and inactive renin in plasma and peritoneal dialysate were studied in pentobarbitone anesthetized cats during 8 hours of peritoneal dialysis. In control cats, despite a significant rise in plasma active renin from 1.3 +/- 0.22 to 4.4 +/- 0.76 pmoles AI/ml/hr over 8 hours, plasma inactive renin was unchanged. Four-fold rises in plasma active renin after hemorrhage (15 ml/kg) and captopril (1 mg/Kg I.V.) were unaccompanied by significant change in inactive renin. Bilateral nephrectomy resulted in undetectable plasma active renin after 3 hours but plasma inactive renin was 25-30% of initial levels 6 hours post-nephrectomy. In peritoneal dialysate, active renin remained low in control cats but there was a ten-fold rise of inactive renin from 0.06 +/- 0.02 to 0.60 +/- 0.07 pmoles AI/ml/hr. After hemorrhage there was a slight rise of active renin after 3 and 4 hours. Inactive renin was lower than control 6 hours after nephrectomy and captopril, but higher than control 1 and 2 hours after hemorrhage. Dialysate inactive renin accumulation slopes were not different among treatments. Acute changes in plasma active renin have little effect on peritoneal dialysate renin.", 
    "107": "The authors report three cases where captopril was used in pregnancy. This was shown to be more useful in cases of essential hypertension than in toxaemia. There was no bad side effect from the use of Captopril. It did not alter the fetal growth once the hypertension was well controlled. Using it together with other anti-hypertensives has to be thought out very carefully and it has to be used with great care. The state of the newborns at birth was satisfactory. Follow-up was without complications except for one case where was a persistent ductus. Whether captopril had any role to play in this is uncertain. Although these results are good, captopril should not be used as first choice treatment in hypertension.", 
    "108": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for unambiguous detection of antibodies against the sulphydryl drug D-penicillamine (PA) and its disulphide-conjugated metabolites. Disulphide-linked PA human serum albumin (PA-HSA) conjugates for use as coating antigens were prepared by a range of procedures employing oxidation with either potassium ferricyanide (0.1 M) or cupric sulphate (5 ppm). A satisfactory degree of conjugation was achieved by both oxidative procedures. Hapten density and antigenicity were increased when urea-denatured rather than non-denatured HSA was used. In 2 out of 3 rabbits, a specific IgG anti-PA response was detected following monthly injection of PA keyhole limpet haemocyanin (PA-KLH) in Freund's complete adjuvant. In the third rabbit, any anti-PA activity was obscured by a high level of binding to HSA. The anti-PA response was slow to develop in the 2 responder rabbits (requiring four injections) and was of low intensity (antibody titres less than 6,000). In contrast, the IgG antibody response to the structurally related drug captopril (CP), administered under identical conditions, was rapid in onset and of greater intensity (titres greater than 6,000 after one injection of CP-KLH). The hapten specificity of the IgG anti-PA-HSA antisera was defined by ELISA inhibition assays. Binding of IgG to PA-HSA was inhibited by PA, PA disulphide, PA cysteine and disulphide-linked PA-HSA conjugates, but not by PA acetone (thiazolidine ring-linked PA), CP, or unconjugated HSA. The inhibitory preparations were inactive in unrelated ELISAs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Active renin and trypsin-activatable inactive renin were also measured by indirect RIA with angiotensin-I antibodies. The V/A ratio for the different forms of renin calculated from the results of direct and indirect RIA were not different. The V/A ratio of active renin for the kidney with the stenotic artery was 3.04 +/- 0.28 (mean +/- sem) with direct and 3.02 +/- 0.25 with indirect RIA. The contralateral ratio was 1.04 +/- 0.02 with the direct and 1.05 +/- 0.02 with the indirect RIA. In essential hypertension it was 1.28 +/- 0.04 with direct RIA and 1.28 +/- 0.04 with indirect RIA. Chronic treatment with captopril had no influence on this ratio in both patients groups. The V/A ratio of total immunoreactive renin was lower than that of active renin and this ratio had lost discriminative power for lateralization. This ratio was significantly greater than one on the affected side in renal artery stenosis but not contralaterally and in essential hypertension. This study shows that renin activity after trypsin-activation of plasma is an accurate measure of the total renin concentration, i.e. active renin plus prorenin. It also shows that a kidney with a stenotic artery secretes inactive renin, which is immunologically related to active renin and is likely to be prorenin. Direct RIA for measuring active renin is technically more simple than indirect RIA. Direct RIA however is somewhat less sensitive. For measuring the V/A ratio for active renin in patients with renal artery stenosis this can be overcome by stimulating the renin-angiotensin system for instance by captopril.", 
    "110": "In the present study 12 patients with severe chronic heart failure (7 with dilated cardiomyopathy and 5 with ischaemic heart disease) underwent right heart catheterization at rest and during isometric exercise by handgrip before and 6 months after treatment with captopril (mean dose 2 X 39.6 mg/day) while concomitant digitalis and diuretics were unchanged. After 6 months resting haemodynamics changed as follows: decrease in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary pressure and total vascular resistance; increase in stroke volume index and stroke work index. During handgrip the following changes were observed after captopril: decrease in total vascular resistance; increase in stroke volume index and stroke work index. Before captopril 11 patients showed no increase or even a decrease in stroke work index during isometric exercise, whereas after captopril 5 out of the 12 patients showed an increase in stroke work index. The results demonstrate that in patients with severe chronic heart failure long-term treatment with captopril lowers preload and afterload, which is accompanied by a significant improvement in left ventricular performance at rest. Furthermore, during isometric exercise after captopril an improvement in left ventricular function was found in 5 out of 12 patients.", 
    "111": "The effects of metoclopramide (MTC) and bromocriptine (BRC) (two drugs which act as antagonist and agonist of DOPA-receptors, respectively) on the zona glomerulosa of dexamethasone/ACTH-treated rats were investigated by coupled biochemical and morphometric techniques. Short-term (1-h) MTC administration significantly increased the plasma concentration of aldosterone, while long-term (7-day) MTC administration, as well as short- and long-term treatment with BRC did not cause any apparent change. Long-term MTC administration was found to significantly potentiate both the rise in the plasma level of aldosterone and the hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its parenchymal cells induced by a prolonged treatment with angiotensin II (AII), but not those evoked by a chronic sodium deprivation alone or combined with AII infusion. Long-term BRC administration notably counteracted the effects of sodium restriction (coupled or not with AII infusion), but not those induced by the administration of AII alone. Long-term MTC administration partially reversed both the lowering of the plasma concentration of aldosterone and the atrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its parenchymal cells caused by a prolonged sodium-loading (combined or not with captopril infusion), but not those produced by the administration of captopril alone. On the other hand, long-term BRC treatment induced a further significant reduction in the blood level of aldosterone and the volume of zona glomerulosa and its cells only in captopril-treated animals. These findings are consistent with the view that the dopaminergic system exerts a maximal tonic inhibitory effect not only on the secretory activity, but also on the growth and steroidogenic capacity of the rat zona glomerulosa. Furthermore, they suggest that the activity of the dopaminergic system is in turn controlled by the sodium balance, being almost completely suppressed by a prolonged sodium deprivation.", 
    "112": "We investigated inhibition by captopril of the hydrolysis of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and kyotorphin by human dipeptidases (DPases). The rate of LTD4 hydrolysis by kidney DPases F and S, pancreas and liver DPases were 60.6, 23.8, 23.3 and 0.358 units/mg protein, respectively. The inhibition by captopril was competitive for DPase F and liver DPase, and non-competitive for DPase S and pancreas enzyme. Using kyotorphin as a substrate, captopril inhibited four DPases competitively. From these results it is suggested that some side effects of captopril may relate to inhibition of hydrolytic activities of DPases with physiologically active dipeptides in man.", 
    "113": "The effects of captopril monotherapy and combination therapy with thiazide diuretics or with methyldopa on glucose tolerance test (GTT) were investigated in 71 diabetic hypertensives. After the baseline evaluation, captopril (37.5-75 mg/day) was given. GTT and insulin assay were performed again between 10 and 12 weeks after the initiation of captopril therapy. We also studied the effects of chronic captopril therapy (6-12 months) on GTT in patients with essential hypertension. Captopril was well tolerated in all patients and no adverse reactions were observed. Chronic captopril therapy produced a significant (p less than 0.01) fall of blood pressure in all patients. There was no significant deterioration of the insulinogenic index or the time course curves of plasma glucose and insulin after GTT. These results indicate that captopril therapy does not affect glucose metabolism. Thus captopril may have an advantage for clinical use in hypertensive patients with or without impaired glucose metabolism.", 
    "114": "The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RA) and of prostaglandins (PG) to the acute depressor effect of captopril (Capt) was studied in 13 hypertensive patients suppressing either RA by propranolol (Prop) or PG by indomethacin (Indo). Four patients showed abolition of the depressor effect of Capt by pretreatment with both Prop and Indo (Group 1). Indo, but not Prop, cancelled the depressor effect in another 4 patients (Group 2). In the remaining 5 patients, either Prop or Indo did not alter the depressor response to Capt (Group 3). Patients in Group 3 were older than patients in Group 1 and 2 and showed lower plasma volume value. Several mechanisms might contribute to the acute depressor effect of Cap, including not only the suppression of RA and the enhancement of PG, but perhaps other undetermined factor(s), especially in older patients.", 
    "115": "Thirty-one essential hypertensives with normal or low PRA were evaluated before and after a single oral dose (50 mg) of captopril. A significant fall both in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) was obtained in the subgroup of patients who were classified as \"normal kallikrein hypertensives\", while no significant change in BP was observed in \"low kallikrein hypertensives\". Furthermore the mean percentage fall in mean BP, throughout the 2 hours following captopril administration, was significantly related to the basal value of urinary kallikrein excretion (r = 0.47 p less than 0.05) in the entire group of patients. Our results suggest that a blunted activity of the kallikrein system might be responsible for failure of captopril in lowering BP in patients in whom the renin-angiotensin system is not pathogenetically implicated.", 
    "116": "The effects of captopril on the forearm hemodynamics in patients with severe congestive heart failure were studied, using strain-gauge plethysmography. To determine whether prostaglandins are involved in the captopril actions, indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, was administered. In 8 patients, captopril (25 mg) decreased mean blood pressure (P less than 0.01) and venous pressure (P less than 0.05); forearm blood flow (P less than 0.05) and maximum venous volume (P less than 0.05) were increased; forearm vascular resistance (P less than 0.05) and forearm venous tone (P less than 0.05) were decreased. Venous distensibility was improved with captopril (P less than 0.05). All the hemodynamic changes were attenuated by indomethacin (50 mg). Captopril increased circulating bradykinin (P less than 0.05), prostaglandin E2 (P less than 0.05) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (P less than 0.05). Indomethacin did not affect bradykinin level but blocked the increase in prostaglandins. These data suggest that captopril dilates both arterial and venous vessels not only by blocking the renin-angiotensin system but by increasing local or circulating vasodilator prostaglandins.", 
    "117": "Effects of captopril on arterial pressure (AP) and renal function were investigated in patients with non-malignant \"benign\" or malignant phase essential hypertension (EH group), or with chronic renal failure (CRF group). After captopril administration, AP and renal vascular resistance (RVR) decreased significantly, and renal blood flow (RBF) and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased in both groups. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased in the EH group, but was unchanged in CRF. Filtration fraction decreased in the malignant hypertension and CRF groups. Significant correlations were found between baseline PRA and baseline RVR, and the captopril-induced decrease in mean AP, decrease in RVR, increase in RBF, and increase in GFR in the EH group, while these associations were not observed in CRF. These results indicate that the high AP, RVR, suppressed RBF and GFR in the EH group were closely related to activity of the renin-angiotensin system, but not so the low RBF and GFR in CRF. Small doses of captopril may improve impaired renal function in EH, and may not cause deterioration in the CRF group.", 
    "118": "Isolated rat hindlegs were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution and released angiotensin I (ANG I) and ANG II were determined. The release of ANG I and ANG II in nephrectomized rats did not differ from those in control group. Pretreatment with captopril (50 mg/kg/day) for 3 days or addition of captopril (2 X 10(-6) M) to the perfusate induced increase in ANG I release and decrease in ANG II release. These findings suggest that ANG II is locally generated and release from the vascular tissues. Captopril may inhibit the conversion of vascular ANG I into ANG II.", 
    "119": "The role of renomedullary lipids in the hypotensive effect of captopril was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats, one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats and two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats using inhibitors of acetyl glyceryl ether phosphorylcholine and prostaglandins, and chemical medullectomy. Our experiments indicate that it is unlikely that renomedullary lipids contribute to the hypotensive action of captopril.", 
    "120": "The blood pressure, heart rate and humoral responses to single intravenous doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were evaluated in 5 volunteers on a free salt intake. Each subject was given at one-week intervals a 1, 5 and 25 mg intravenous dose of captopril as well as the vehicle of captopril. The study was conducted in a single-blind fashion and the order of treatment phases was randomized. Captopril was found to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system in a dose-dependent fashion. A fall in circulating angiotensin II was observed with doses of 1 and 5 mg. Plasma angiotensin II was not detectable 15 min after the 25 mg dose. Acute inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with intravenous captopril had no effect on blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "121": "To clarify effect of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) on heart rate regulation, captopril (2 mg/kg) was injected intravenously (i.v.) with or without pretreatment of atropine and also responses to intracisternal (i.c.) injections were examined. Captopril induced bradycardia with lowering blood pressure, and this bradycardia was abolished by pretreatment of atropine. Reduction of heart rate by i.c. injection of captopril was significantly larger than those of i.v. injection. Furthermore, to determine whether CEI can modify baroreflexes centrally, the aortic depressor nerve (ADN) was stimulated electrically in captopril treated rats. Vasodepressor and sympatho-inhibitory responses induced by ADN stimulation were significantly attenuated by captopril, while the bradycardiac response was not changed. These findings suggest that captopril attenuated centrally vasodepressor and sympatho-inhibitory responses of the baroreflex and activated centrally cardiac vagal efferent activity.", 
    "122": "Patients with heart failure should stop smoking, maintain an optimal weight and limit their intake of salt. Alcohol abuse should be avoided. The detection and early treatment of hypertension appears to have had a major impact in preventing heart failure. Diuretics revolutionized the treatment of congestive heart failure and their proper and appropriate use can alleviate peripheral and pulmonary oedema. Diuretics should not be overused and care should be taken to avoid hypokalaemia. Controversy surrounds the use of digoxin in patients in sinus rhythm; the drug should be used in patients in atrial fibrillation. The use of an inotropic drug may be harmful in the presence of coronary artery disease. A reduction in the current use of digoxin might be of benefit to many patients with heart failure. When the drug is prescribed it should be used in a therapeutic and not homeopathic dose. Recent interest has been directed toward the use of vasodilators and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In my opinion, these drugs should be used after patients have been treated with thiazide and loop diuretics. Vasodilators are particularly beneficial in acute heart failure or in patients with chronic heart failure when the symptoms are related to fluid overload and volume expansion. The cause of symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure optimally treated with diuretics is controversial. Shortness of breath may not be simply related to the left atrial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "123": "A single-blind trial was carried out in 18 patients with moderately severe hypertension to investigate the efficacy of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in combination with the calcium antagonist verapamil after treatment with captopril alone had failed to achieve satisfactory control. For the first 2 weeks of the study, patients received 50 mg captopril twice daily, then 50 mg captopril plus 160 mg verapamil twice daily for 4 weeks, followed by 160 mg verapamil twice daily for a further 4 weeks. The double-dummy technique was used with placebo tablets given during the first and last treatment periods. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements in the supine and standing position were made at 2-week intervals throughout the study. Analysis of the results from the 13 patients who completed the trial protocol showed that the two drugs in combination produced significant reductions (p less than 0.01) in both supine and standing blood pressures compared with captopril alone, but a significant reduction (p less than 0.02) only in diastolic blood pressure compared with verapamil alone. Heart rate was not changed significantly throughout the study. Only 1 patient was withdrawn because of side-effects, although on questioning constipation, in particular, proved to be a problem in many.", 
    "124": "We have measured the plasma concentrations of captopril and total disulfide conjugates of captopril after a 50 mg oral dose in 6 uraemic patients on maintenance dialysis and in 8 hypertensive subjects with normal renal function. The mean peak plasma concentration of captopril was 2.5 times higher (0.447 micrograms X ml-1 vs 0.181 micrograms X ml-1) and the concentrations of the disulfides 4 times higher (3.62 micrograms X ml-1 vs 0.924 micrograms X ml-1) in the uraemic patients. Moreover captopril disulfide conjugates in the uraemic subjects reached peak concentrations at 8 h after the dose and subsequently felt. The apparent plasma half-time was 46 +/- 19 h. Only 15% of these conjugates were removed by dialysis. This marked accumulation of captopril conjugates was associated with a sustained fall in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In uraemic patients the mean maximum reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 37 +/- 7 mmHg and 24 +/- 9 mmHg respectively, occurring 6 h after the dose, compared with 8 +/- 7 and 8 +/- 1 mmHg respectively at 30 min in normal renal function patients. These results are consistent with the results of animal experiments, which show that captopril disulfides can be converted back to free captopril and can contribute to the antihypertensive effect of the drug. They provide a reationale for reducing the dose and frequency of administration of captopril in patients with significant renal impairment.", 
    "125": "Adrenergic receptors (alpha 2, beta 2), plasma noradrenaline, heart rate and the pressor responsiveness to infused noradrenaline were examined in ten healthy male volunteers before and after 2 weeks of placebo or captopril therapy in a double blind cross-over study. No significant differences in these measurements were observed between the captopril and placebo treated groups. The study shows that in sodium replete normotensive subjects, long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition does not lead to changes in adrenoceptor density. There is also no alteration in plasma noradrenaline levels nor in the pressor responsiveness to infused noradrenaline. These data suggest that the known interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system observed in animals is probably of little significance in man.", 
    "126": "The efficacy of captopril in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon was observed in an open study in 53 patients with primitive Raynaud's disease and in 18 patients with Raynaud's associated with scleroderma. Each patient was given captopril 25 mg three times a day for three months. The drug significantly decreased the frequency and the severity of ischaemic attacks in patients with Raynaud's disease, but did not affect the attacks in patients with scleroderma. These subjective ratings were supported by the results of digital strain gauge plethysmography during cold challenge. The therapy was discontinued in six patients (one because of an allergic skin reaction and five owing to orthostatic hypotension), but no serious side-effects were noticed.", 
    "127": "Twelve normotensive patients with coronary artery disease and stable effort-induced angina pectoris were selected: the antiischemic effect of captopril was studied. A maximal cycloergometer effort test was obtained before (base) and after administration of placebo or captopril (50 mg p.o.). The following parameters were measured: heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), maximal rate/pressure product (MRPP), maximal workload sustained, (MWS), maximal working time (MWT), and S-T depression at MRPP. The base and placebo were similar. Compared to them captopril augmented the MWT, increased the MWS, reduced S-T depression at MRPP, and decreased the number of patients with effort-induced angina pectoris. The antiischemic effect of captopril seems related both to its effect on HR and BP, and to a local enhancement of coronary blood flow.", 
    "128": "The results of clinicoinstrumental investigations in 33 patients with coronary heart disease and coronary heart disease combined with essential hypertension complicated by stage I-II cardiac insufficiency showed that therapy with captopril at a daily dose of 25-75 mg resulted in the correction of cardiac insufficiency in 84% of the patients, with a hypotensive effect in 80%. Captopril improved myocardial contractility, decreased pressure in the pulmonary artery and total peripheral vascular resistance and produced no major side-effects.",

All patients began treatment with frusemide at a dose of 25 mg once a day. The 35 non-responsive patients to frusemide were then treated, by random selection, with captopril at a dose of 25 mg twice a day, or nadolol at a dose of 80 mg once a day, for three months. The results show no significant differences on the hypotensive effect with either drug; in view of the incidence of side-effects of the two drugs, treatment with captopril is clearly better tolerated by the patients.", 
    "130": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is increasingly used as monotherapy for hypertension, especially because of the minimal side effects. Combination of ACE inhibitor therapy with diuretics has several practical and theoretical advantages.", 
    "131": "This review considers the hypothesis that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other antihypertensive drugs may reduce blood pressure by altering the balance of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator hormones. Most cases of essential hypertension are characterized by increased vascular resistance. Since vascular resistance can be viewed as a net balance of offsetting vasoconstrictor and vasodilator neurohumoral forces, and since angiotensin II and norepinephrine can stimulate the synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins that can in turn counteract peripheral vasoconstriction, we measured changes in vasoconstrictor (angiotensin II) and vasodilator (PGE2) hormones after giving different antihypertensive drugs. We found that the sulfhydryl containing converting enzyme inhibitor captopril increased vasodilator prostaglandin production (PGE2-metabolite) both acutely and chronically. This increase in PGE2-metabolite was not seen with the non-sulfhydryl converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril.", 
    "132": "Hyperuricaemia carries with it a high risk of tophi development affecting connective tissue in kidney, skin and joints, its overt clinical expression being gout. Diuretics, which are invariably prescribed in congestive heart failure and widely used for the treatment of essential hypertension, may cause hyperuricaemia and predispose to gout by inducing renal retention of urate. The angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril have been found to augment renal urate excretion both in normal volunteers and in hypertensive patients. Current evidence appears to indicate that the uricosuric effect of captopril and enalapril could be due to the rises in renin and angiotensin I these drugs elicit by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition, and/or to pharmacological actions not related, at least directly, to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Serum urate levels have been significantly reduced by monotherapy with captopril in hypertensive patients suffering from hyperuricaemia. Diuretic-induced hyperuricaemia in hypertensive patients can be prevented or counteracted by the administration of captopril and enalapril. Available clinical data support the argument that captopril and enalapril should be used as first choice drugs for the treatment of hyperuricaemic hypertensive patients. When diuretic-induced hyperuricaemia develops in patients suffering from congestive heart failure, captopril or enalapril should be added to the therapeutic regime in doses capable of countering the shift in plasma urate concentration, provided the clinical condition of the patients permits such additional pharmacological treatment. Therapy with captopril and enalapril should preferably be instituted in a gradual manner, especially in patients with hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent the precipitation of urate in the kidney and in the urinary tract.",

    "135": "Current issues in paediatric hypertension are reviewed in the light of an international symposium held in Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany, in October 1985. Primary (essential) hypertension has emerged as an important domain of epidemiologists, involving genetics, pathophysiology and clinical paediatrics. Understanding of secondary hypertension has increased, largely as a consequence of improved survival of children with progressive kidney disease. Methodological procedures, normal standards and determinants of blood pressure and the definition and incidence of hypertension are discussed, as well as new developments in antihypertensive treatment, such as the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium blocking agents. Finally, some proposals for future research topics in the field of childhood hypertension are given. The Appendix contains recommendations for the measurement of blood pressure and for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents.", 
    "136": "The influence of different vasoactive substances on the evolution of HgCl2-induced acute renal failure (ARF) was evaluated in the dog. HgCl2 alone caused a progressive fall in both glomerular filtration (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) during the first 3 h of the mercury administration (delta after 3 h: -44% and -39%) and provoked a concomitant stimulation of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and thromboxane systems. The administration of the thromboxane inhibitor dazoxiben (2 mg/kg i.v. every 2 h) adequately inhibited the activation of the thromboxane system after HgCl2, but could not prevent the fall in GFR and RBF. The continuous intrarenal administration of the Ca2+ entry blocker verapamil (0.005 mg/kg per min) into the left kidney resulted in the prevention of the postmercurial fall in GFR and RBF at the perfusion site. This beneficial effect was immediately lost when the verapamil administration was stopped. Finally, the administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (300 micrograms/kg every 2 h) resulted in an effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, the prevention of the postmercurial fall in RBF, and the partial attenuation of the fall in GFR. This beneficial effect was immediately lost after the intravenous administration of indomethacin (2 mg/kg). These results indicate that the fall in GFR after HgCl2 can be prevented by vasoactive agents such as captopril and verapamil and point at least in part to a pathophysiological role of the renin-angiotensin system or of an alteration in the equilibrium between renin-angiotensin and prostaglandins. The thromboxane system is seemingly of no major importance.", 
    "137": "To evaluate renal microcirculation during acute cyclosporin (CsA) administration (50 mg/kg, i.v.), seven euvolaemic Munich-Wistar rats were studied. CsA infusion caused a significant decrease in total glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (0.96 +/- 0.04 vs 0.47 +/- 0.07 ml/min) and in single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) (27.90 +/- 3.4 vs 14.02 +/- 3.5 nl/min). The efferent arteriolar resistance increased substantially (P less than 0.05) while the afferent resistance rose moderately. Consequently, there was an increase (P less than 0.05) in mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC), from 45 +/- 1 to 55 +/- 4 mmHg, together with an important decrease in mean glomerular plasma flow rate (QA), from 100 +/- 17 to 44 +/- 13 nl/min. Since tubular hydraulic pressure was maintained unaltered, an elevated transglomerular hydraulic pressure difference was observed (P less than 0.05). The lower values of SNGFR were accounted for by both the decrease in QA and in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf). The latter was reduced from 0.096 +/- 0.03 to 0.031 +/- 0.010 nl/sec per mmHg (P less than 0.05) by CsA. Additionally, three groups of Munich-Wistar rats were previously treated with captopril (2 mg/kg per h, i.v.), verapamil (20 micrograms/kg per min, i.v.) or indomethacin (2 mg/kg, i.v.). Both captopril and verapamil minimised the renal effects of CsA, with a decline of approximately 25% instead of approximately 50% on GFR and RPF. Thus CsA infusion caused a decline on SNGFR due to an important reduction in QA and Kf with an impressive increase on arteriolar resistance, a mark of angiotensin II stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "138": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied in 11 hypertensives without a history of stroke. Mean hemispheric CBF (mCBF) was measured in each patient by Xe-133 inhalation method before and after 7 days of captopril administration. Blood pressure (BP) both in the control state and at the time of CBF measurement decreased significantly after drug administration. mCBF, however, did not show any significant change. When percent changes in mCBF before and after the administration were plotted against those of mean arterial BP, significant inverse correlations were obtained in both hemispheres; the larger the BP decrease, the more increase in CBF was observed. It is concluded that captopril lowers systemic BP without concomitant decrease in CBF in hypertensive subjects with no history of stroke. Furthermore, the results suggest that captopril may have a vasodilating action on cerebral blood vessels.", 
    "139": "Nine white leghorn chickens were injected i.m. with furosemide (10 to 60 mg/kg body weight) twice daily for 18 days. The birds were then anesthetized with a combination of equithesin and diazepam and the kidneys perfused via the heart. Kidney tissue was sectioned serially and the granular epithelioid cells were counted in the juxtaglomerular apparatuses of the furosemide treated birds and in 3 normal chickens. Hyperplasia and hypergranulation of the epithelioid cells was found to occur in the juxtaglomerular apparatuses of both mammalian and reptilian type nephrons (with and without Henles loop) in the furosemide treated group. This finding was interpreted as an effect of hypovolaemia on the juxtaglomerular apparatuses. Furosemide caused an immediate stop in weight gain, an increase in the erythrocyte volume fraction and a sudden drop in blood pressure. The blood pressure later rose to subnormal levels. The heart rate was not altered. Plasma sodium and chloride fell significantly one day after furosemide administration and remained low throughout the experiment. Potassium fell during the second part of the experimental period. Captopril was injected after 18 days of furosemide treatment and lowered the blood pressure significantly. This was interpreted as indirect evidence for the presence of renin in the granular epithelioid cells and indicates the importance of the renin angiotensin system in maintaining the blood pressure in hypovolaemic conditions.", 
    "140": "Reperfusion injury is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the development of posttransplant acute tubular necrosis. Previous studies have shown that addition of the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine (TFP) to Collins' flush solution protected the cortical microcirculatory integrity and dramatically improved renal viability after transplantation. The present report describes the protective effect(s) of TFP in the course of reperfusion injury. Twenty mongrel dogs underwent bilateral nephrectomy; in each instance, the left kidney was flushed immediately with 250 ml of cold Collins' solution, and the right kidney was flushed with the same solution containing TFP, 5 mg/L. After 48 and 72 hr of preservation, each kidney was connected through silastic shunts to the femoral vessels of another dog. The mean renal blood flow (RBF) immediately after reperfusion was 2.2 ml/g/min and 1.7 ml/g/min in the left and right kidneys, respectively, and was similar to mean RBF measurements prior to nephrectomy. After 15 min of reperfusion, there was a sharp decrease in mean RBF in the Collins' flushed kidneys, which persisted after 60 min of reperfusion (0.37 ml/g/min). In contrast, there was only a mild decrease in mean RBF in the TFP-flushed kidneys (1.27 ml/g/min). A partial explanation for the favorable effect of TFP may be related to the inability of the ischemic cell to handle the increased calcium load associated with reperfusion (calcium paradox). In a test of this possibility, 0.5 mg/kg of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, was infused during reperfusion. No beneficial effects of this drug were noted in either Collins' or TFP-flushed kidneys (n = 10). However, when 1.25 mg/kg of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was infused at the time of reperfusion, a dramatic amelioration of the reperfusion injury occurred in the Collins' flushed kidneys (1.2 ml/g/min) (n = 10). Taken together, these data suggest that the damage to cold-preserved kidneys flushed with Collins' solution alone may occur at the time of actual reperfusion. Such reperfusion damage is ameliorated by TFP and captopril. The known relationship between calcium and the effect of angiotensin on the vascular smooth muscle cell may explain in part the protective role of calcium inhibitors placed in preserved kidneys prior to reperfusion.", 
    "141": "Inactive renin has been studied extensively in human plasma, but in animal plasma its accurate quantification has proved more difficult, due partly to higher activity of plasma protease inhibitors. Such activity in human plasma can be conveniently destroyed by a metalloprotease in Bitis arietans venom, with concommitant release of endogenous enzyme activities, such as plasma kallikrein, that then activate inactive renin. It was therefore of interest to look for inactive renin in rat and rabbit plasma using this approach, so providing, in addition, a comparison for the disparate data of other groups who have used trypsin or acid for activation. In both rat and rabbit plasma the proportion of inactive renin was 62% of total renin, whereas human plasma contained more inactive renin and a higher proportion, 82%. A higher concentration of venom was required for rat (33 ug venom/ml plasma) and rabbit (4 micrograms/ml) than needed for activation, at a similar rate, in human plasma (1 microgram/ml). When applied to studies of rats made hypertensive and hyper-reninaemic by aortic ligation for 5 days, higher total (active + inactive) renin was observed. The proportion of inactive renin, as a percentage of total renin in plasma collected at this time, was, however, found to diminish significantly. In conclusion, puff adder venom activates inactive renin in rat and rabbit plasma and can be used to study physiological changes in inactive renin in such animal plasma.", 
    "142": "We have recently shown that circulating atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is higher than that in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The present experiment was designed to examine the possible effects of chronic treatment with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on plasma ANP levels in SHR. Captopril and enalapril lowered blood pressure and reduced relative ventricular weight in SHR but not to the level of WKY. Plasma ANP levels were decreased by captopril and enalapril compared with untreated SHR. These results suggest that the ANP release may be suppressed in ACEI-treated SHR compared with untreated SHR. We speculate that a reduction of cardiac overload by ACEI may in part explain the decline of circulating ANP.", 
    "143": "The metabolic effects of Enalapril (EN) were compared in a cross over study with those of Propranolol (PPL). Long term treatment with the ACEI did not modify the lipid and glucose profile and increased urate excretion, while PPL increased triglycerides and decreased urate clearance.", 
    "144": "To investigate the role of Angiotensin II in the release of ACTH, the response of adrenocorticotrophic hormone to hypoglycaemia was studied before and during treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, in 15 male patients with essential hypertension. Plasma levels of ACTH were measured before and 60, 90 and 120 min after an i.v. bolus of normal saline, as placebo, and, 3 days later, after an i.v. bolus of regular insulin (0.15 U/Kg b.w.). Enalapril treatment was then started and both placebo and hypoglycaemic tests were repeated 15 days thereafter. No changes in ACTH plasma levels were observed after acute normal saline either before or during enalapril treatment. On the contrary, hypoglycaemia induced a sharp increase of ACTH before enalapril (from 19.5 +/- 4.1 to 74.4 +/- 13.0 pg/ml, p less than 0.01 60 min after insulin) but not during ACE inhibition (from 26.1 +/- 6.2 to 34.6 +/- 5.9 pg/ml, NS, at min 60 of the study). The present data confirm our previous observation on the reduction of the hypoglycaemic-induced ACTH release during ACE inhibition with captopril and support the hypothesis that circulating Ang II may exert a facilitating role on adrenocorticotrophic hormone release.", 
    "145": "Side effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not common with currently recommended doses. Hypotension, hyperkalemia and renal impairment may occur under special circumstances, and relate directly to blockade of ACE, in particular when pre-treatment renin levels are high. Other adverse effects, once quite common when excessive doses of captopril were prescribed, are now rarely seen. A possible exception is cough. Though not dangerous, cough is not infrequently seen during treatment with ACE inhibitors. Experience with these drugs is insufficient to recommend their use in the hypertension of pregnancy. The \"metabolic-profile\" with ACE inhibitors appears favourable, since they can increase uric acid excretion and lower plasma urate levels, carbohydrate tolerance is unaltered or improved, and lipid levels are unchanged. Electrolyte and metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics are blunted by addition of an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "146": "To evaluate the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on metabolic effects as well as blood pressure, we studied 255 mild-to-moderate American essential hypertensives. After a 4-week placebo period subjects were randomly assigned to receive captopril (C) 25 mg tid, hydrochlorothiazide (H) 15 mg tid or both agents in combination (C j) tid. A significant (p less than 0.05) fall in blood pressure was seen in all three groups; C + H had a greater (p less than 0.05) than C or H. H was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) fall in serum potassium and significant (p less than 0.05) increases in uric acid, glucose and cholesterol. With C alone no changes in these parameters were seen. With combination therapy (C + H) significant (p less than 0.05) blunting of diuretic-induced changes in potassium and uric acid and the significant increases in glucose and cholesterol seen with H were prevented. The side effects reported were mild with all regimens and rarely required discontinuation of therapy. The efficacy, safety and advantages of ACE inhibition make it attractive as primary treatment in mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "147": "Captopril Research Group of Japan made an evaluation of clinical usefulness of captopril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. A relatively low frequency of side effects manifested as clinical symptoms was observed when the daily dose of captopril used was 37.5-112.5 mg. Antihypertensive effect was well maintained in this dose range. Follow-up surveillance of captopril also confirmed this. Abnormalities in blood chemistry were also found to be very less frequent. Untoward metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors such as alteration of serum electrolytes, lipid profiles or glucose metabolism were reported to be minimal or not actually observed. Side effects and untoward metabolic effects may appear more frequently when the same dose was given in patients with renal impairment. ACE inhibitors can be used as the first choice of drugs in the treatment of essential hypertension with no renal function impairment.", 
    "148": "Long-term effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on split renal function were studied using a noninvasive radioisotopic method in five patients with renovascular hypertension. In the stenotic side the glomerular filtration rate which acutely decreased following captopril, tended to return toward pretreatment levels on prolonged captopril administration (up to 2 years), while the value remained unchanged in the nonstenotic side of the kidney. Effective renal plasma flow increased in both sides. During long-term captopril treatment, there were no significant changes in serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, and blood pressure control was maintained at the same level in an acute period. These results suggest that the glomerular filtration in the stenotic kidney of renovascular hypertension, which was acutely reduced, will not further deteriorate, but will increase after prolonged captopril treatment.", 
    "149": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were measured in 19 cases with primary aldosteronism (PA) and 72 with essential hypertension (EHT) to differentiate the two disorders in the following conditions: after overnight recumbency (basal state) and after oral administration of captopril. Screening criteria were determined in order to pick up all of PA patients as positive. After the captopril administration, the specificity of a criterion based on the combination of PAC and PAC/PRA ratio was 93% and positive predictive value 79%. This criterion was superior to other conventional screening methods. However, higher specificity (97%) and positive predictive value (90%) were obtained from a combination criterion based on the basal PAC and PAC/PRA ratio. The single oral administration of captopril may not bring an improvement in the screening of PA.", 
    "150": "In four patients with essential hypertension and one patient with renovascular hypertension, decreases in blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II levels, and increases in plasma renin activity and plasma kinin levels were observed during eight days of alacepril treatment. Significant correlations between the changes in mean arterial pressure and those in plasma angiotensin II or kinin levels were observed positively or negatively, respectively, in the essential hypertensives. These findings suggest that the hypotensive effect of alacepril might be caused mainly by a decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels and, at least in part, by an increase in plasma kinin levels.", 
    "151": "Intraarterial ambulatory pressure (AP) was recorded before and during therapy with captopril or enalapril in two groups with hypertension. Seven patients were admitted during the study. The monitoring of AP and heart rate (HR) was performed during placebo therapy and following a minimum period of 7 days of 25 mg twice daily captopril or 2.5 to 10 mg once daily enalapril. The AP and HR following percutaneous insertion of a cannula into the brachial artery were sampled then data were analyzed as reported previously. After the cannula was inserted, examinations of tilt-up, handgrip and ergometer were performed. Both drugs produced a significant reduction of ambulatory AP throughout 24 hours with preservation of the overall shape of the circadian curve. The results also demonstrated that both drugs had not affected normal daily activities. Thus, twice daily captopril and once daily enalapril can be used as the first-line therapy of hypertension.", 
    "152": "The use of sublingual captopril has been recently suggested in hypertensive crisis on the assumption of a faster absorption and thus a more rapid effect on blood pressure than with the oral route. To verify this hypothesis we have compared the hypotensive effect of oral and sublingual captopril in 40 essential hypertensives who were randomly allocated to either route of administration. Captopril was administered orally dissolved in water or allowed to dissolve under the tongue. After 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 90 minutes blood pressure, Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) were measured. No significant differences were found between the two groups in the time course of blood pressure decrease, PRA increase and ACE inhibition. The changes of the parameters studied was superimposable irrespective of the route of administration thus not supporting the hypothesis that sublingual captopril might be absorbed more rapidly.", 
    "153": "The blood pressure effect of 8-day angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was studied in normotensive healthy volunteers maintained on an unrestricted salt intake. Six volunteers received cilazapril (5 mg/day), 5 perindopril (8 mg/day) and 5 CGS14824A (10 mg/day). The 3 investigational inhibitors were found to have no consistent effect on blood pressure monitored during day-time outside the clinic using a semi-automatic blood pressure recorder (Remler M2000).", 
    "154": "The effects of captopril on cardiorenal function were studied in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. A single oral dose of captopril in 16 patients significantly increased cardiac indices and decreased total systemic vascular resistance. These changes were greater in subjects with higher baseline plasma renin activity (PRA). The increase in PRA and decrease in plasma aldosterone were also greater in this group. During 7 days of captopril therapy, renal plasma flow distinctly increased in 10 patients in whom renal function was followed. The increase in renal blood flow was greater in subjects with higher PRA. Simultaneous infusion of aprotinin in eight of these subjects did not affect the captopril-induced increase in renal plasma flow: these responses were the same in both PRA subgroups. The results suggest that captopril reduces total systemic vascular resistance in patients with chronic congestive heart failure through the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and the preferential renal vasodilating effect of captopril seems exclusively to be the sole result of this inhibition, with the kallikrein-kinin system or kinin-mediated prostaglandins not playing a major role.", 
    "155": "The role of endogenous angiotensin II and prostaglandins (PGs) in the antihypertensive effect of converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was studied in essential hypertension by the separate and the combined administration of captopril and indomethacin. Although plasma angiotensin II was similarly suppressed by the separate and the combined administration of captopril and indomethacin, captopril lowered and indomethacin increased the mean blood pressure. There were negative correlations between the changes in mean blood pressure and in urinary sodium excretion as well as in urinary PGE excretion. These results suggest that endogenous PGs may be implicated in the antihypertensive effect of captopril through the alteration of sodium balance.", 
    "156": "We evaluated the influence of indomethacin on the pharmacological actions of Enalapril in 9 uncomplicated essential hypertensives. While on chronic treatment with Enalapril, these patients randomly received indomethacin (50 mg bid) or a corresponding placebo for 1 week and the opposite treatment after a 2 week interval. Indomethacin, which decreased serum thromboxane B2 and urinary 6-keto prostaglandin-F1 alpha, reduced the plasma renin activity (PRA) increased by Enalapril. Indomethacin did not modify serum ACE, whose activity had been reduced by the ACE inhibitor. Mean blood pressure (MBP) values, which were significantly and to a similar extent reduced by Enalapril at the beginning of the cross-over, after placebo addition and at the end of the two week interval, were significantly increased by indomethacin, despite being still significantly lower than baseline values. These data show that systemic and renal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibition induced by indomethacin can blunt the antihypertensive effect of chronic Enalapril treatment in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "157": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that intrarenal angiotensin AII formation participates in the control of renal perfusion and function. Inappropriate activation of this intrarenal system may participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension in about 45 percent of patients with essential hypertension, a group that we call \"non-modulators\" (NM). In NM the renal vascular response to AII is blunted when the subjects are on a high-salt diet, but appropriate when they are on a low-salt diet. Converting enzyme inhibition in NM induces a larger increase in renal blood flow, than occurs in normal subjects or other patients with essential hypertension, most evident when they are on a high-salt diet. The renal vasodilatation is not due to prostaglandin or bradykinin accumulation in the kidney, since the increase in renal blood flow induced by converting enzyme inhibition is associated with an enhanced renal vascular response to AII. When NM are shifted from a low to a high sodium intake, they show more positive sodium balance, gain more weight and increase their blood pressure more--the characteristics of sodium sensitive hypertension. Converting enzyme inhibition corrects their inability to handle a sodium load as it improves renal blood flow, and induces a depressor response that does not correlate with plasma renin activity. Many of these characteristics are shown in a normotensive offspring of essential hypertensives: since sodium handling is genetically determined, this abnormality may represent the inherited renal abnormality. An abnormality in the control of the renal circulation by AII, reversed by converting enzyme inhibition, may represent a fundamental abnormality in the pathogenesis.", 
    "158": "The renin-angiotensin system plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. ACE inhibitors block the production of angiotensin II and are efficacious in the therapy of patients with heart failure, ACE inhibitors have combined preload and afterload reducing effects. Cardiac index is augmented, cardiac filling pressures are reduced and renal function may improve with ACE inhibition. Long-term subjective and objective improvements have been reported. Preliminary data suggest that this class of vasodilators may favorably influence the prognosis of advanced heart failure.", 
    "159": "205 patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension participated in a six-month double-blind parallel study performed in a unique center. After a two-week single-blind placebo period, the patients were randomly allocated to receive either Enalapril 20 mg once-a-day or placebo as the first step treatment. They were then followed-up every two weeks and successive doses of hydrochlorothiazide, oxprenolol, and dihydralazine were added until the diastolic pressure was lower than 90 mmHg. After six months, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower in the Enalapril than in the control group (129/82 +/- 12/6 mmHg versus 136/86 +/- 10/5 mmHg; p less than 0.001). Drug withdrawal was necessary for 8 patients in the Enalapril group and for 16 patients in the control group (p less than 0.05). The number of daily tablets was 2.7 +/- 1.8 in the Enalapril group and 4.4 +/- 2.4 in the control group (p less than 0.01). Therefore, a stepped-care program based on Enalapril appears significantly more effective than a stepped-care program based on a diuretic.", 
    "160": "The renin-angiotensin system has a range of physiological actions concerned with the control of the circulation. Angiotensin II has both an immediate and a delayed pressor effect, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone, promotes thirst, stimulates the sympathetic nervous system at various sites while inhibiting vagal tone, and has a range of direct effects on the kidney. Several aspects of this range of actions can become deranged in a number of forms of hypertension as well as in congestive cardiac failure. Hence much effort has been directed in recent years to the development of agents designed to interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and to apply these clinically in the treatment of hypertension and congestive cardiac failure. Orally active converting enzyme inhibitors are of proven benefit not only in renovascular hypertension, but also, when combined with loop diuretics, in the treatment of intractable hypertension as well as, both alone and in combination with thiazide diuretics, in the treatment of essential hypertension. In congestive cardiac failure controlled trials have shown that converting enzyme inhibitors can improve exercise tolerance while diminishing lassitude, correct potassium deficiency and limit ventricular arrhythmias. Energetic efforts are being made to develop orally active inhibitors of the enzyme renin itself, since these would be more specific in action than the presently available and very successful converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "161": "A series of five structurally distinct ACE inhibitors were evaluated for their ability to inhibit tissue ACE activity in the SHR after oral administration. In the first series of experiments, the ACE inhibitors captopril, enalapril, pentopril, CGS 14824A and CGS 16617 were given to groups of SHR at doses that produced a 15 to 20 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure within 1 hour. Under these conditions of dose and time, only captopril significantly inhibited brain ACE activity (43%), whereas inhibition of serum ACE activity ranged from 72% to 99% with these agents. Inhibition of aortic ACE activity ranged from 54% to 87%, and lung ACE inhibition varied from 50% to 83%. In the second series of experiments, SHR were administered higher doses of each ACE inhibitor such that these compounds produced peak reductions in blood pressure (-25 mm Hg to -33 mm Hg) within a range of 2 to 6 hours. When tissue ACE activity was measured at the time corresponding to peak reduction in blood pressure, all five ACE inhibitors produced a significant inhibition of brain ACE activity ranging from 21% to 76%. Serum ACE activity was almost completely inhibited by these agents, with the exception of captopril (62% inhibition). The inhibition of aortic ACE activity ranged from 79% to 99%, while the inhibition of lung ACE activity did not increase under these conditions. These data suggest that ACE inhibitors may exert their maximal antihypertensive effects by inhibiting ACE in vascular tissues and brain.", 
    "162": "In vitro autoradiographic mapping of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in sheep brain using the specific ACE inhibitor, 125I-351A, revealed very high densities of binding in large blood vessels and choroid plexus. In the a very high density of labelling occurred in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and median eminence and a high density in the subfornical organ and moderate density in supraoptic, suprachiasmatic, arcuate and paraventricular nuclei. All fiber tracts were unlabelled. In the medulla oblongata, a very high density of binding was detected in the area postrema and a high density in the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus; a moderate density was found in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal tract and the inferior olivary nucleus.", 
    "163": "The role of renal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in blood pressure regulation is not well understood. In our studies, both acute and chronic treatment of hypertensive rats SHR and SHRSP with ACE inhibitors Enalapril and SA446 had a blood pressure lowering effect that coincided with an inhibition of renal cortical and aortic ACE, but not plasma ACE. Further, ACE activities in the renal cortex and aorta were found to increase with aging of the SHRSP, therefore concomitantly with hypertension development. In the kidney, brush border membranes (BBM) contained abundant ACE. We found that the activities of ACE in the renal cortex closely correlated to the activities in isolated BBM, in Wistar Kyoto rats and in the SHRSP. Thus, renal cortical ACE activity and blood pressure correlated in cases of ACE inhibition and hypertension development. Since the ACE activity in the renal cortex appeared to reflect the enzyme activity in BBM, the brush border ACE may have to be taken into account, in view of the relationship between renal ACE and blood pressure.", 
    "164": "This study was designed to evaluate changes in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive dogs. Blood pressure increased and remained elevated for eight months after partial clamping of the left renal artery. Plasma renin activity was increased for one month after surgery, but then returned to the pre-clamping level. SA-446, a potent ACE inhibitor, reduced blood pressure in 8 M-hypertensive dogs. Plasma ACE activities was not altered during the course of hypertension, but vascular ACE activities in the pulmonary and mesenteric arteries and the aorta were significantly increased in 8 M-hypertensive dogs. These results may indicate that ACE plays an important role in the maintenance of chronic phase of 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertension and that suppression of vascular ACE activities might be a mechanism underlying the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "165": "Local renin-angiotensin systems have been described in organ controlling cardiovascular function. Following oral administration of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors the enzyme was inhibited not only in lung vascular endothelium and blood, but also in the heart, kidney, vascular wall, brain and other organs. Evidence for a contribution of tissue CE inhibition to the cardiovascular actions of CE inhibitors is provided by the antihypertensive effect of brain CE inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats, by the concomitant persistence of blood pressure decrease and CE inhibition in vascular wall and kidney after chronic oral CE inhibitor treatment, and by the marked effects of oral CE inhibitor pretreatment on cardiac function in isolated rat hearts. Local inhibition of tissue renin-angiotensin systems may therefore be an important factor involved in the beneficial effects of CE inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases such as arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "166": "The regulation of prostacyclin (PGI2) generation by angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) related substances was investigated using cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Angiotensin I (AI) or bradykinin (BK) increased PGI2 generation and ACE activity, while the ACE inhibitor, captopril decreased both of them, and angiotensin II (AII) did not show any effect. The increasing rate of PGI2 generation induced by AI or BK was not affected by the pretreatment with captopril. These results suggest that the accumulation of AI or BK via the inhibition of ACE by captopril did not cause the enhancement of PGI2 generation. Rather, it was proposed that the enhanced PGI2 generation by AI or BK might be regulated by ACE activation derived from these substances, as an autoregulation mechanism.", 
    "167": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition by MK 421, SA 446 or captopril (6 mg/kg/day ip) for up to 6 days induced significant fall in systolic blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II concentration. The hypotensive effect was greater in sodium depleted rats than in sodium repleted rats. The hypotensive effect was also accompanied by increased excretion of urinary prostaglandin E2, however the levels of urinary prostaglandin E2 in sodium repleted rats were not different from those in sodium depleted rats. Urinary kinin excretion was increased during infusion of MK 421, SA 446 or captopril in sodium depleted rats, whereas no significant change was found in sodium repleted rats. Thus the present results suggest that renal prostaglandin E system may not be essential for the hypotensive effect of these inhibitors. In addition, the greater hypotensive effect of these inhibitors in sodium depleted rats may be in part due to stimulated renal kinin system.", 
    "168": "In order to elucidate the antihypertensive action of angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) in the kidney, intrarenal (IR) administration of CEIs was performed in norepinephrine (NE) or angiotensin-II (AII) induced acute hypertension in conscious unrestrained rabbits. IR administration of the two kinds of CEIs, captopril (5 mg/kg) and MK-422 (1 mg/kg), dose which caused no significant effect when injected intravenously, elicited a prompt and marked depressor action in NE but not in AII induced hypertension. In addition, IR infusion of the angiotensin-II analogue, saralasin (2 and 10 micrograms/kg/min) showed no depressor effect in NE induced acute hypertension. These results indicate that the kidney plays an important role in the depressor action of CEIs in NE but not in AII induced hypertension and this effect may not be related to the IR renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "169": "Effects of the pentapeptide renin inhibitor (RI-78; Phe(4Cl)-Phe-Val-Tyr-Lys-NH2) and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (teprotide) on mean arterial pressure (MAP) were examined in conscious monkeys (M. fascicularis). In salt depleted normotensive monkeys with a MAP of 95 +/- 4 mmHg and plasma renin activity (PRA) of 15.9 +/- 2.7 ngAI/ml/h, a bolus injection of a dose of 375 micrograms/kg of RI-78 caused a prompt hypotensive effect. Maximal hypotensive action was seen within 1 min, and MAP returned to the basal level within 15 min. With this dose, MAP was reduced by 20 +/- 6 mmHg. Teprotide (1 mg/kg) decreased MAP and reached a nadir after 13 min. There was no significant difference between maximal hypotensive responses seen with RI-78 (375 micrograms/kg) and with teprotide (1 mg/kg). Hypotensive effects of RI-78 and teprotide were also examined in acute renal hypertensive monkeys with a MAP of 125 +/- 5 mmHg and a PRA of 27.1 +/- 5.7 ngAI/ml/h. Again, similar hypotensive effects were observed. We conclude that antihypertensive effect of RI-78 is comparable to that seen with teprotide.", 
    "170": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of hypotensive action of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) in hypertension. In perfused mesenteric vasculatures from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar kyoto rats (WKY), the effects of captopril on the vascular responsiveness and norepinephrine overflow from the adrenergic nerve endings were examined. The vasoconstrictor responses and norepinephrine overflow during the electrical nerve stimulation was significantly enhanced in SHR compared with WKY. Captopril reduced not only vasoconstrictor responses but also norepinephrine overflow during the nerve stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion. The suppressions of these responses by captopril were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. These results demonstrate that captopril could affect the presynaptic site of the resistance vessels and cause a decrease in electrically-stimulated norepinephrine overflow from the adrenergic nerve endings. The marked reduction of the pressor responses and norepinephrine overflow to nerve stimulation by captopril in the SHR suggests that the renin-angiotensin system in the vascular beds in enhanced in this model of hypertension.", 
    "171": "Acute administration of captopril has been reported to decrease noradrenaline (NA) release from the sympathetic nerves. In this study the chronic effects of ramipril on the sympathetic nervous system of male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have been investigated and compared to those of captopril and enalapril. As parameters for catecholamine biosynthesis and storage, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and the catecholamine content of the hearts and the adrenal medulla were measured by HPLC in treated and control SHR. To assess sympathetic outflow plasma NA and adrenaline (A) levels were determined during preganglionic stimulation (PS) of the spinal cord. Under none of these drugs could differences be observed between the treated and control animals, neither in the biosynthesis and storage of catecholamines in the heart and adrenal medulla nor in the sympathetic outflow. However, the dose response curves of blood pressure vs PS were significantly shifted to the right when ACE-inhibitors were administered, most strongly by ramipril. In view of the unaltered presynaptic sympathetic function long term treatment with ACE-inhibitors is suggested to increase bradykinin and angiotensin I. Bradykinin and angiotensin I are capable of releasing NA and A from the adrenal medulla, like angiotensin II.", 
    "172": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of two CEI: captopril and perindopril on reperfusion arrhythmias and noradrenaline 3H (NA3H) release in the isolated rat heart on arrhythmias in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats subject to left coronary artery ligation. In vitro, in control preparations, reperfusion after 10 min of local ischemia produced by coronary ligation was accompanied by a sudden release of NA3H in coronary flow and long lasting ventricular arrhythmias. Reperfusion arrhythmias were prevented by perfusion medium containing a high dose of CEI and CEI did not change the patterns of NA3H release. In vivo, mortality due to ventricular fibrillation was significantly reduced in rats pretreated with captopril or perindopril 15 min prior to coronary ligation. CEI reduced the severity of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF).", 
    "173": "Perindopril is a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which is activated after hydrolysis in vivo to a diacid (S9780). Oral administration of perindopril (1-16 mg) to groups of 6 healthy males led to a long lasting and dose-elated inhibition of plasma ACE and rises in plasma renin activity with no evidence of accumulation of drug or effect. At higher doses there was a modest fall in blood pressure. S9780 given intravenously in doses of 1,2 or 4 mg caused an immediate inhibition of plasma ACE. The concentration of S9780 in plasma which led to 50% inhibition of plasma ACE was 1.55 +/- 1.14 ng/ml (mean +/- S.D.). Clinical trials with 2-8 mg once daily in essential hypertension are currently in progress.", 
    "174": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity was found in all rat arteries and veins examined, considerably varied among these vessels, and usually higher in arteries than in corresponding veins except for femoral and subclavian pairs. Decrease of vascular ACE activity in response to cilazapril at hypotensive doses varied in vessels and was not dependent on their ACE activity levels.", 
    "175": "The primate-specific renin inhibitor CGP 29287 (30 mg/kg/d, n = 5) or the converting-enzyme inhibitor CGS 14831 (30 mg/kg/d, n = 8) were administered by continuous intraperitoneal infusion via osmotic minipumps to normotensive marmosets fed a low salt diet. CGP 29287 and CGS 14831 induced a similar reduction in blood pressure after 2 days of administration (-22 +/- 6, SEM and -24 +/- 6 mmHg respectively). The hypotensive response persisted at 7 days (-20 +/- 3 and -22 +/- 8 mmHg respectively). Despite the fall in blood pressure, heart rate was not changed after either inhibitor. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable in control marmosets that received vehicle only (0.9% saline). Plasma renin activity was inhibited after CGP 29287 (100% at day 2 and 75% at day 7) and increased after CGS 14831 (4 and 3 fold on days 2 and 7 respectively). Total plasma immunoreactive renin was increased to a similar extent after both inhibitors (approximately 5 fold on days 2 and 7). These findings show that a similar hypotensive response is induced in sodium-depleted primates after chronic inhibition of renin or converting enzyme. Thus the fall in blood pressure after chronic treatment with either inhibitor appears to be mainly due to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and the consequent reduction in endogenous angiotensin II formation.", 
    "176": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril were measured in patients with renal impairment, by both radioinhibitor 125I MK351A binding studies, and by radioimmunoassay. Plasma concentration of lisinopril estimated by radioinhibitor binding displacement correlated closely with that measured by radioimmunoassay. Plateau lisinopril concentration in 8 patients with varying degrees of renal failure treated with 5 mg lisinopril per day for 1 week, was inversely related to renal function. Plasma lisinopril concentrations of 30-70 ng/ml were required for 50% inhibition of plasma ACE activity in vivo. Acute studies in the rat showed inhibition of ACE in different tissues had different time courses. These observations suggest that 125I MK351A binding studies in tissues will be useful in establishing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of newer ACE inhibitors, and may help delineate the contribution of ACE in different tissues to cardiovascular homeostasis.", 
    "177": "A model of congestive heart failure (CHF) was produced in rats approximately 76 days following surgical occlusion of the left coronary artery. In rats with healed myocardial infarction (MI size = 45% LV), hemodynamic variables were predictably elevated (LVEDP greater than 20 mm Hg) or depressed LV dP/dtmax (5200 mm Hg/sec). The hemodynamic response (MAP, HR, LVEDP, and dP/dtmax) to intravenous infusion of Mil (54 to 347 micrograms/kg) was measured on two occasions, separated by a 7-12 day period of oral treatment (2 mg/kg/day). Enalaprilat was tested in a similar design with the infusion phase (70 micrograms/kg, total dose) separated by oral enalapril (Enal), 1 mg/kg/day. The hemodynamic response to Mil was also examined in rats treated with the ACE inhibitor. At low doses, Mil modestly elevated HR (+17 beats/min) and dose-dependently increased (P less than 0.05) LV contractility by approximately 25%. Higher doses of Mil reduced preload (LVEDP) and afterload (MAP). Oral Mil produced little hemodynamic improvement except modest elevation (+9%) in LV contractility. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis to i.v. Mil. In contrast, enalaprilat reduced MAP and preload without altering HR or contractility, effects observed after oral treatment. In the presence of the ACE inhibitor, Mil's hemodynamic actions were not enhanced. These experiments demonstrate that ACE inhibition improves ventricular performance by reducing preload and afterload. In this model, Mil improves performance by a direct inotropic mechanism as well as a reduction in afterload.", 
    "178": "Converting enzyme inhibitors enhance arterial compliance in hypertensive humans. The enhancement is due not only to an increase in arterial diameter and volume but also to an increase in arterial distensibility. The latter effect reflects the drug action on arterial smooth muscle tone rather than the lower stretch due to the blood pressure reduction. The improvement in the buffering function of large arteries in hypertensives may contribute to produce a more important decrease in systolic pressure and a better reversion of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "179": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were developed to prevent the in vivo generation of angiotensin II and thereby to reduce peripheral vasoconstriction. However, these compounds exert some additional effects that may or may not be angiotensin dependent. These include potential sodium diuresis, bradykinin accumulation, prostaglandin release, blunting of sympathetic activity, parasympathomimetic actions, central effects, redistribution of blood flow toward some particularly important organs. Only the comprehensive assessment of the many complex interactions that exist between the renin-angiotensin and several other regulatory systems reveals the complete therapeutic profile of this class of pharmacologic agents.", 
    "180": "High activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme was demonstrated in human neuroblastoma tissue. This activity required the presence of chloride ion and was almost completely inhibited by a specific converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10 nM), indicating that the activity measured is indeed angiotensin-converting enzyme. Furthermore, the biochemical features of the enzyme were closely similar to the well-known properties of human lung converting enzyme, such as molecular weight (290,000), optimum pH (8.0-8.5), the presence of glycoprotein residues, and dependence on chloride ion concentration. These results provide definitive evidence for the presence of true angiotensin-converting enzyme in human neuroblastoma tissue.", 
    "181": "In 5 normal men sarcosine1-angiotensin II (Sar1-ANG II) (Exp. 1) and sarcosine1-angiotensin I (Sar1-ANG I) (Exp. 2) infused iv at a rate of 5 pmol/kg X min from 0900 h to 0930 h caused the same degree of rise in blood pressure (BP). But 100 mg of captopril given orally at 0800 h (Exp. 3) completely abolished the BP rise by Sar1-ANG I. In Exps. 1 and 2 plasma renin activity (PRA) decreased and plasma aldosterone (PA) increased after the infusions. In Exp. 3 PRA increased markedly and PA decreased 60 min after captopril, and at 30 min of Sar1-ANG I infusion PRA decreased to the pre-captopril level despite no BP change but PA was kept at the pre-infusion level. Hence, substrate specificity of converting enzyme previously demonstrated for N-terminal deleted ANG I was not shown for N-terminal substituted ANG I in man because the conversion of Sar1-ANG I to Sar1-ANG II was 100%. Sar1-ANG I may possibly inhibit renin release in normal men.", 
    "182": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) was purified to homogeneity from human kidney and its specific antibody was raised in the rabbit. The antibody cross-reacted equally with human enzymes from kidney, lung, intestine, plasma and urine. Immunofluorescent and immunoelectron microscopic observation indicated that the enzyme was located on the plasma membrane and micropinocytic vesicles at the luminal site of vascular endothelium in the lung. It was also present on the brush border, intercellular and basal infolding membranes of proximal tubular epithelium, but was not detected on the distal tubular epithelium or vascular endothelium in the kidney. ACE was demonstrated immunocytologically in human alveolar macrophages and renal carcinoma tissues. The carcinoma tissue contained a possible isoenzyme of ACE differing in part immunologically from the enzyme of normal kidney.", 
    "183": "Recent experimental studies showed that inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis may reduce sympathetic activity as evaluated by plasma catecholamine assay, sharing in the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Fifteen patients with essential hypertension were studied. Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated both at rest and after stressor laboratory tests, before and four hours after administration of 20 mg of enalapril maleate and on the 14th and 120th days of continued administration. At the same time, blood samples were drawn for determinations of plasma renin activity, ACE, angiotensin II, plasma aldosterone concentration, and plasma norepinephrine levels. Enalapril in a dosage of 20 mg/day significantly and progressively lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest, with maximal decreases observed on the 120th day of the study period (P less than 0.001). Heart rate at rest and after exercise showed no significant differences throughout the study period. Good blood pressure control was observed during stressor laboratory tests. The greatest impact of blood pressure was observed on the 120th day during dynamic exercise (mean blood pressure from 139 +/- 3.9 to 111.5 +/- 6.3 mmHg; P less than 0.01) and on the 14th day during the cold pressure test (mean blood pressure from 133.3 +/- 3.9 to 111.2 +/- 4.7 mmHg; P less than 0.005). A marked and persistent ACE inhibition and a gradual and progressive decrease of angiotensin II (from 12.42 +/- 2.15 to 5.45 +/- 1.68 pg/ml; P less than 0.005) characterized the humoral activity of enalapril maleate. Moreover, a significant decrease of plasma norepinephrine levels was observed during the follow-up period with maximal reduction on the 120th day (from 311 +/- 34 to 197 +/- 33 pg/ml; P less than 0.01). It has been demonstrated that the pressor effect of angiotensin II was blunted during exercise. Our hemodynamic and humoral results appear to confirm the hypothesis that enalapril maleate may reduce blood pressure by direct inhibition of ACE and of kininase II as well as by a decreased sympathetic output, which may be secondary to angiotensin II inhibition. These results agree with the recent experimental demonstration of a reduced sympathetic nervous response to nerve stimulation during ACE inhibition.", 
    "184": "The remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure was established in rats subject to subtotal (1 7/8) nephrectomy and the evolution of renal injury studied over a period of 6 wk. One wk after subtotal nephrectomy, rats had a mean conscious systolic blood pressure of 158 +/- 5 mm Hg and serum creatinine of 128 +/- 9 mumol/l. Both systolic blood pressure and serum creatinine rose over the next 5 wk in concert with progressive glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered (5 mg/kg/day) to rats (n = 11) from 1 wk after subtotal nephrectomy. Enalapril lowered systolic blood pressure over the treatment period. Systolic blood pressure was 122 +/- 5 mm Hg compared with 176 +/- 7 mm Hg in untreated rats (p less than 0.001) at 6 wk. Serum creatinine 6 wk after subtotal nephrectomy was 110 +/- 9 mumol/l with enalapril treatment, compared with 159 +/- 21 mumol/l (p less than 0.025) in control animals. Enalapril treated rats had lower urinary protein excretion than controls (15 +/- 3 mg/24 hr vs 85 +/- 22 mg/24 hr, p less than 0.0001) at 6 weeks. Glomerulosclerosis, assessed by blinded histological score, was also reduced in the enalapril treated group (1.79 +/- 0.08 vs 2.36 +/- 0.16, p less than 0.01). Enalapril treatment was associated with a reduction in filtration fraction (51Cr-EDTA/125I-hippurate clearance). At 6 wk, filtration fraction was 0.30 +/- 0.03 in enalapril treated and 0.48 +/- 0.03 in control rats (p less than 0.001). Enalapril treatment in the subtotal nephrectomy model of renal failure preserved renal structure and function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "185": "We report our experience with a converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, as antihypertensive agent in eighteen patients with hypertension after renal transplantation. Renal function was prospectively followed up. Six patients demonstrated an acute renal failure episode (defined by a 25% increase of serum creatinine during enalapril therapy). Renal failure was always reversible with interruption or dosage reduction of the drug. We recommend to start therapy with low dose and to closely monitor renal function.", 
    "186": "The relationship between serum concentrations of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, and its antihypertensive action was investigated using integrated pharmacokinetic-dynamic modelling techniques. The model was parameterized in terms of slope \"m\", describing the sensitivity to the fall of blood pressure, and an intercept term \"i\". A linear pharmacodynamic model: E = m. ce(t) + i, adequately characterized the concentration-effect relationship in most of the young (aged 22-30 years) and elderly normotensive subjects (aged 65-73 years). However, no age-related differences were seen, indicating that angiotensin II vasoconstrictor action is unaltered by senescence.", 
    "187": "Lisinopril (MK521), a lysine analogue of enalaprilic acid, the bioactive metabolite of enalapril, has a longer half-life than enalaprilic acid, and is excreted unchanged in the urine. Its kinetic profile and antihypertensive and hormonal effects have been investigated in an open study in 3 groups each of 6 hypertensive patients, with normal, moderate and severe impairment of renal function. Serum drug level, blood pressure, converting enzyme activity (CEA), plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone concentration (PAC), and serum potassium and creatinine were measured during 1 week following a single oral dose and subsequently following 8 daily doses of 5 mg lisinopril. Accumulation of lisinopril was found in the severe renal failure group. CEA was suppressed to less than 10% of its initial value from 4 to 24 h after the initial dose in all three groups, and the suppression was more marked and lasted longer in patients with severe renal failure. An inverse correlation was found in all patients between log serum lisinopril concentration and log CEA. Lisinopril lowered blood pressure in all three groups over 24 h. PRA rose and PAC fell similarly in the groups. Serum potassium increased in the renal failure groups and creatinine remained unchanged in all groups. Thus, when lisinopril 5 mg is given daily to patients with severe renal failure it may accumulate. The high serum lisinopril concentration does not cause an excessive antihypertensive effect. In patients with severe renal failure, adjustment of the dose or the dosing frequency to the degree of renal failure is recommended to avoid administration of doses in excess of those required to achieve adequate inhibition of converting enzyme.", 
    "188": "The pharmacokinetics of free unchanged captopril, total captopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were investigated in three groups of patients with moderate essential hypertension and normal renal function on the first and on the 45th days of an oral treatment with either captopril (50 mg once daily, n = 7) or HCTZ (25 mg once daily, n = 10) or their combination captopril 50 mg + HCTZ 25 mg once daily, n = 8. Simultaneously, the effects of the three treatments on plasma converting enzyme activity (PCEA) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured. Elimination half-lives of total captopril after acute (7.8 +/- 2.3 h) or chronic (7.0 +/- 0.5 h) captopril dosing were similar to those of HCTZ after acute (6.5 +/- 1.0 h) or chronic (8.0 +/- 2.5 h) HCTZ dosing. Elimination half-life of free unchanged captopril was 0.81 +/- 0.09 h after acute and 0.96 +/- 0.03 h after chronic captopril dosing. Addition of HCTZ to captopril induced no major change in free and total captopril pharmacokinetic parameters, in PCEA inhibition and in PRA increase (as they were determined after captopril alone) on acute as well as on chronic treatment. Addition of captopril to HCTZ induced no major change in HCTZ pharmacokinetic parameters and in PRA increase compared with those determined after HCTZ alone. Chronic treatment with captopril + HCTZ resulted, like chronic captopril treatment, in no accumulation of captopril, in no significant modification of free and total captopril pharmacokinetic parameters and of PCEA inhibition (as determined after acute administration) but led to a significant enhancement of the acutely induced increase in PRA. Chronic treatment with captopril + HCTZ resulted, like chronic HCTZ treatment, in no accumulation of HCTZ, in no significant modification of HCTZ pharmacokinetic parameters (as determined after acute administration) but also led to a significant enhancement of the acutely induced increase in PRA. Thus, the longer duration of the antihypertensive action of captopril + HCTZ as compared to that of captopril cannot be ascribed to a pharmacokinetic or biological interaction between captopril and HCTZ.", 
    "189": "The emergence of diuretic drugs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ranks amongst the major therapeutic advances of modern medicine. The discovery of these drug groups arose largely by chance, yet each has dramatically influenced the treatment of congestive cardiac failure and arterial hypertension. The central role which diuretics have had in the management of both oedema and hypertension hinges on their ability to induce a net renal excretion of solute and water by selective interference with either active or passive ion transport processes in different segments of the nephron. Irrespective of sites of action, the continued antihypertensive action of diuretics is characterized by a reduction in plasma volume and extracellular fluid (ECF) volume that lasts for as long as the diuretic is given. The mechanism of this effect remains unclear but may involve autoregulatory reactions that leave cardiac output unaltered but maintain a sustained reduction in total peripheral resistance. ACE inhibitors also lower blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral resistance, leaving cardiac output, plasma volume and ECF volume unchanged. The detailed way these haemodynamic changes are achieved remains unknown but inhibition of converting enzyme present not only in the kidney but also in many extrarenal tissue sites, appears important. In both hypertension and cardiac failure, however, the kidney acts as a key target organ for ACE inhibitors. The increased renal vascular resistance and inappropriate renal salt excretion are reversed with enhanced renal blood flow and saluresis. Both angiotensin II (AII) and vasopressin-mediated contraction of glomerular mesangial cells is inhibited, making glomerular filtration more efficient. Reduced aldosterone secondary to blockade of AII formation contributes to saluresis whilst encouraging positive potassium balance. ACE inhibition also impairs breakdown of kinins which may contribute to intrarenal and peripheral vasodilation either on their own or via release of prostaglandins and other vasoactive substances. The hypotensive actions of diuretics are potentiated by ACE inhibition primarily through blockade of AII formation and prevention of secondary aldosteronism. In combination, these drugs permit low doses to be used because of their synergistic effects. Caution has to be exercised whenever ACE inhibition is used, without and especially with diuretics, in the management of renovascular hypertension and other low-perfusion states. In these circumstances, AII plays an important autoregulatory role in preserving glomerular filtration through an increase in post-glomerular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "190": "Anesthetized dogs in acute left ventricular failure were treated with the ACE-inhibitor enalaprilat (MK-422). ACE-inhibition produced a fall in the mean blood pressure and a redistribution of cardiac output to the brain, right ventricle, upper gastrointestinal tract, and the inner and middle part of the renal cortex. The flow to the spleen, adrenals, skin, muscle, fat, lower gastrointestinal tract, and outer renal cortex did not change significantly. The differential sensitivity of the tissues to ACE-inhibition is most likely due to differences in sensitivity to circulating angiotensin II.", 
    "191": "The medical treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon must be adapted to each particular case. Benign cases do not require drug therapy. Various substances seem able to relieve the most severe cases (calcium blockers, alpha-blockers). Prostaglandins perfusions and plasmaphoresis must be reserved for the most severe cases, with trophic disorders not improved with less aggressive treatments.", 
    "192": "The regional hemodynamic effects of MC-838, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and captopril at equidepressor doses were examined in the anesthetized dog by simultaneously measuring renal (RBF), coronary (CBF), vertebral (VBF) arterial and aortic blood flow (AoF). Hemodynamic responses to angiotensin I (AI), AII and noradrenaline were compared before and after the administration of each inhibitor. MC-838 (3 mg/kg i.v.) lowered gradually aortic pressure (AoP) and increased moderately AoF and RBF up to 60 min after the administration. Captopril (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) lowered AoP immediately after the administration and increased AoF and RBF more shortly than MC-838. Neither inhibitor produced a marked change in VBF or CBF. The effects of the inhibitors in the renal vascular bed was much greater than that in vertebral and coronary vascular beds, although vascular resistance in all of them was significantly reduced. Each of the drugs inhibited the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to AI. These results indicate that the renal vasculature is more sensitive to both MC-838 and captopril than vertebral and coronary vasculature, but MC-838 has a slower and longer-lasting action than does captopril.", 
    "193": "Total Body Potassium (TBK) was measured by whole body counting of 40K in 3 patients with Bartter's syndrome before, after 3 months and after 1 year of treatment with enalapril. In 2 patients TBK was found to be decreased before treatment, whereas TBK was within the normal range in the 3rd. During treatment serum potassium concentration and TBK increased in each subject and symptoms of fatigue and tetany disappeared. Enalapril is shown to be an effective treatment in Bartter's syndrome as it improves serum potassium, TBK and complaints.", 
    "194": "A new, orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, CGS 14824A, was evaluated in 12 healthy male volunteers. Two groups each of 6 volunteers were given 5 or 10 mg once daily p.o. for 8 days. Four hours after the first and the last morning doses, plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone and plasma converting enzyme activity had fallen, while blood angiotensin I and plasma renin activity had risen. Throughout the study, more than 90% inhibition of ACE was found immediately before giving either the 5 or 10 mg dose and 50% blockade was still present 72 h following the last dose. Based on the determination of ACE, there was no evidence of drug accumulation. No significant change in blood pressure or heart rate was observed during the course of the study. CGS 14824A was an effective, orally active, long-lasting and well tolerated converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "195": "The density of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors on the platelet and the vascular responsiveness to infused angiotensin II before and after two weeks of captopril therapy were examined in ten healthy male volunteers. There was a significant increase in blood flow to the forearm, but no significant changes in either the density of angiotensin II receptors or the pressor response to infused angiotensin II following captopril therapy. The study demonstrates that long term reduction of angiotensin II formation by captopril in man does not increase the responsiveness of the receptors to infused angiotensin, nor results in an \"up regulation\" of the angiotensin receptors. It also provides further evidence that some of the long term vasodilator effects of captopril may be mediated by mechanisms other than inhibition of angiotensin I (Ang I) converting enzyme.", 
    "196": "We have studied the effects of treatment for one month with perindopril, 4 or 8 mg once daily, in seven hypertensive patients. Blood pressure was lowered from 164/93 mm Hg to 145/84 mm Hg by 4 mg of perindopril and after one month remained at 142/82 mm Hg. Neither postural hypotension nor tachycardia occurred. Inhibition of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) lasting for over 24 h was achieved and there was a significant increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). Maximum plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of perindopril, S-9780, were detected four h after oral administration. After treatment for one month there was evidence of reduced sensitivity of plasma ACE to the action of the inhibitor. The plasma concentration of S-9780 required to produce 50% inhibition of plasma ACE rose from 2.4 ng X ml-1 following the first dose to 5.5 ng X ml-1 after one month.", 
    "197": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a glycoprotein, is found in high concentration in pulmonary capillary endothelial cells. Several investigators have studied the relationship between various direct and indirect pulmonary insults and ACE activity and in some cases have found conflict. In an attempt to clarify this relationship we have examined the effect of endotoxin on rat plasma ACE activity in vitro and in vivo. We used the synthetic ACE substrate 3H-BPAP and the assay described by Catravas and Gillis [J Pharmacol Exp Ther 217:263-270, 1981]. In vitro, a statistically significant concentration-dependent reduction in ACE activity was demonstrated (p less than .005). In vivo an intravenous dose of endotoxin (20 mg/kg) alone resulted in no significant change in plasma ACE activity. However, the combination of intravenous endotoxin (20mg/kg) and mild hemorrhage (5-10% of blood volume) caused a statistically significant reduction in plasma ACE activity by 15 min as compared to control rats with hemorrhage only (39% vs. 66%, p less than .005). This reduction persisted at 30 and 60 min. However, by 180 min ACE activity was no longer statistically different from control values. We have demonstrated an acute reduction of plasma ACE activity in the endotoxemic rat that appears to be dependent on the amount of circulating endotoxin and the presence of mild blood loss.", 
    "198": "The effect of a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, ramipril, was studied on both inhaled histamine and bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in six male, normotensive, mild asthmatic subjects. Oral administration of 10 mg ramipril caused no change in lung function or airway reactivity to inhaled histamine or bradykinin despite achieving adequate reduction in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity.", 
    "199": "We tested the effect of oral enalapril on intradermal bradykinin to determine if kininase II inhibition occurs with therapeutic doses in vivo. Six normal male volunteers took either 5 mg enalapril orally or placebo on 2 days. Three hours later bradykinin was injected into the skin of the back in doses increasing from 10(-11) to 10(-9) M. Enalapril increased the bradykinin-induced wheal. Inhibition of kininase II may cause accumulation of endogenous bradykinin. This could be an important mechanism in the occasionally reported side effect of angioedema with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting group of drugs.",

    "201": "Intravenous enalaprilic acid (2.5 mg) was given to 11 patients with stable cardiac failure (NYHA functional class II-IV). Reductions in mean right atrial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25%, 18% and 30% respectively (P less than 0.01), were observed. Cardiac output rose by 13% (NS) and mean blood pressure fell by 20% (P less than 0.01) with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance of 24% (P less than 0.01). Heart rate was unaltered. The haemodynamic effects correlated with control plasma renin activity (r = 0.78, P less than 0.01). Marked hypotension occurred in several subjects but no other side-effects were noted. The rapid onset of action and mixed venous and arteriolar dilating activity of intravenous enalaprilic acid may be an advantage in some clinical situations where parenteral vasodilating therapy is required.", 
    "202": "The experiments were carried out to elucidate the effect of carboxycathepsin (CC) activity inhibition by a specific inhibitor--captopril--on plasma enzyme concentration in normotensive rats and rats with renovascular hypertension. A single oral administration of captopril (10 mg/kg body weight) produced an increase in CC concentration in both hypertensive and sodium-depleted normotensive rats with a parallel decrease in arterial pressure, but had no effect on sodium-repleted normotensive rats. It is suggested that the increase in plasma CC concentration is a compensatory response to the inhibition of CC activity by captopril; it is also possible that the increase observed reflects the state of renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "203": "Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone was degraded by cells of the N-18 line of mouse neuroblastoma and their membrane. Cleavage products were separated by HPLC and identified by amino acid analysis. Fragments (1-3), (4-5), and (6-10) were major cleavage products. All the products increased in level as a function of time except for fragment (1-5), which increased in amount only during a short incubation time and then decreased. The accumulation of fragment (1-5) was increased in the presence of captopril or EDTA, whereas that of fragments (1-3) and (4-5) decreased inversely. On the other hand, the generation of either fragment (1-3) or (4-5) was stimulated by the presence of Cl-. The results suggest that the conversion of fragment (1-5) into fragments (1-3) and (4-5) is catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme. p-Chloromercuribenzoate inhibited the formation of fragment (1-5), a result suggesting the involvement of a thiol protease in this formation. Thus, the degradation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone by neuroblastoma cells and their membrane seems to take place mainly through the cleavage of the Tyr5-Gly6 bond by a thiol protease, followed by the release of the dipeptide Ser-Tyr from the liberated fragment (1-5) by angiotensin-converting enzyme. It is further suggested that the thiol protease and angiotensin-converting enzyme are also responsible for the initial minor cleavages of the Gly6-Leu7 bond and the Trp3-Ser4 bond, respectively.", 
    "204": "The effects of converting-enzyme inhibition (25 mg oral captopril) on coronary hemodynamics in the presence and absence of activation of the renin-angiotension system were studied in 10 patients with mild essential hypertension with no evidence of ischemic heart disease. Coronary blood flow was determined by thermodilution before and after 1 week of diuretic therapy in six patients and before and after placebo in four patients. The diuretic (50 mg/day furosemide) reduced coronary blood flow and increased coronary vascular resistance; in these same patients, captopril reduced mean arterial pressure and the rate-pressure product but increased coronary flow significantly. There was no change in any of these variables after captopril in the placebo group. Similar results were obtained in normotensive rats treated with hydrochlorothiazide; the increase in coronary flow after captopril correlated significantly with the control plasma renin activity. These results in hypertensive humans and normotensive experimental animals indicate that diuretic therapy reduces coronary blood flow significantly, and angiotensin can play a significant role in modulating coronary vascular resistance under conditions associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "205": "In essential hypertension ventricular function is determined primarily by the degree of hypertrophy (myocardial factor) and by the organic complications in the coronary artery (coronary factor). Ventricular function is inversely correlated with ventricular size and systolic wall stress, inasmuch as ventricular function diminishes when these two variables increase. Even the young hypertensive heart of normal size with no angiographic abnormalities appears to be prone to ischemia, because the coronary reserve is seriously limited even in the absence of coronary stenosis. Unlike ventricular distensibility, myocardial compliance may be normal even in the presence of pronounced myocardial hypertrophy. As myocardial compliance decreases, systolic wall stress increases and ventricular function is reduced. The hypertensive heart, the most common form of an irregular hypertrophy of the ventricular wall, is found in 14% of such cases. Analysis of the degree of hypertrophy shows that the hypertrophy can be inappropriately high (high mass-to-volume ratio, reduced wall stress), appropriate, or inappropriately low (normal mass-to-volume ratio, increased wall stress). Coronary reserve is reduced even in hypertensive hypertrophy without evidence of coronary artery disease. MVO2 per mass unit was directly correlated with systolic wall stress per cross-sectional area of the left ventricular wall. It is concluded that the appropriateness of left ventricular hypertrophy, as a result of mass-to-volume ratio and stress, is a major determinant of left ventricular performance, of coronary blood flow, and of myocardial oxygen consumption. Pharmacotherapeutical means of reversing cardiac hypertrophy (prazosin, clonidine, enalapril, and nifedipine) were analyzed in concentrically, as well as eccentrically, hypertrophied left ventricles. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy, i.e. therapeutic intervention on a critical precursor of hypertensive congestive heart failure, can be obtained by various antihypertensive agents. Prazosin, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as well as a combined treatment regimen using alpha-receptor blockers together with diuretics and vasodilators can all induce regression of hypertrophy associated with an improvement in left ventricular function. Moreover, an improved coronary reserve may reduce the ischemic risk of the hypertrophied myocardium. However, not all antihypertensive drugs seem equally effective in bringing about coronary regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. No regression or little regression has been found with diuretic monotherapy despite a satisfactory reduction in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "206": "Blockade of endogenous angiotensin II (ANG II) biosynthesis by intramuscular administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (1 or 10 mg/kg b.w.t.) completely suppressed salt appetite induced by sodium depletion in the pigeon. The effect was selective since captopril did not reduce deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)-induced salt appetite nor water drinking to ANG II and eledoisin. Blockade of brain ANG II receptors by pulse intracerebroventricular (pICV) injection of the ANG II receptor antagonist [Sarcosine1, isoleucine8] ANG II produced a marked, although partial, inhibition of salt appetite. The inhibition was quantitatively similar to the effectiveness of the ANG II receptor blockade, as measured by the suppression of drinking to pICV ANG II. Blockade of brain aldosterone (ALDO) receptors by pICV injections of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-28318 did not significantly suppress depletion-induced appetite at doses that markedly reduced DOCA-induced salt appetite. These findings suggest that the pigeon might be completely dependent on ANG II for the expression of depletion-induced salt appetite. This is in contrast with what has been found in the rat, in which blockade of both ANG II and ALDO are necessary to suppress the appetite.", 
    "207": "We investigated the effects of captopril on the plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) level and the renin angiotensin system in rats. A single oral administration of captopril decreased the plasma ANP level and increased the plasma renin activity (PRA). Chronic administration of captopril for 2 weeks caused no changes in plasma ANP level, but PRA was increased. This suggests the hypothesis that the hemodynamic changes rather than changes in the renin angiotensin system caused by captopril may affect the plasma ANP level.", 
    "208": "Increased systemic resistance is the main haemodynamic abnormality in DOCA-salt hypertension which is more pronounced in young than in adult rats. A mild increase of cardiac output also contributes to higher blood pressure in young animals. Arterial compliance is decreased only in young hypertensive rats. The acute blockade of different pressor systems indicates that the role of back-up pressor systems (vasopressin and angiotensin II) is increased in adult DOCA-salt hypertensive animals while the increased activity of adrenergic system and digoxin-like factors contributes to the enhanced hypertensive response of young rats.", 
    "209": "Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) exerts a potent diuretic and natriuretic action in rat, dog and man. To test whether these actions of ANP are due to antagonism of the antinatriuretic actions of endogenous angiotensin II, an examination was made of the renal actions of ANP in anesthetized rats with and without captopril pretreatment. Captopril treatment did not alter the diuretic and natriuretic action of a single, intravenous bolus injection of ANP (1000 ng of the 8-33 ANP). Captopril treatment did significantly attenuate the diuretic and natriuretic actions of Furosemide (20 mg/kg ip). This attenuation was not reversed by concomitant, exogenous angiotensin II infusion. These results suggest that while ANP exerts its renal actions independently of the circulating renin-angiotensin system the diuretic and natriuretic action of Furosemide is modulated by a substrate of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "210": "Evidence for the existence of factor(s) other than blood pressure responsible for modulation of myocardial hypertrophy accompanying hypertension is well documented. A factor that has been isolated from the myocardium of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and partially purified has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis in vitro. Three indexes of protein synthesis, namely incorporation of 3H-leucine into myocyte myosin, specific activity of the leucyl tRNA, and rate of protein synthesis, also were observed to significantly increase on exposure to this factor, which may play a key role in the modulation of myocardial hypertrophy that accompanies hypertension. Evidence has also been presented demonstrating the role of unknown factors that control the shift of myosin isozymes from V1 (a high-ATPase, high-contractile protein type) to V3 (a slow ATPase type myosin), and vice versa. This study demonstrates that the modulation of the myocardial mass can be controlled at different levels: first at an intrinsic intracellular level by the mechanism of a local growth factor, and then at the level of the contractile protein, the quality rather than quantity of which was found to be important. Both of these were observed to be modulated by factor(s) independent of blood pressure and myocardial mass. However, it remains to be determined what is responsible at the genetic level for transmitting the signal that selects what type of protein will be synthesized and whether there is a common pathway among all the controlling factors.", 
    "211": "Neural and humoral mechanisms involved in the reflex pressor response during mechanical stimulation of the stomach of rats were investigated. The arterial blood pressure response was prevented by inhibition of alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction using either an alpha-adrenergic blocker or a ganglionic blocker. In addition, there was a small decrease in the response after nephrectomy. However, there were no alterations in the response after beta-adrenergic blockade, bilateral adrenalectomy, inhibition of converting enzyme activity with enalapril or bilateral cervical vagus nerve transection. The heart rate was not modified after either intervention. After vagotomy the time of recovery of the basal blood pressure was significantly prolonged. It can be concluded that the blood pressure response to mechanical stimulation of the stomach wall is of neural rather than of humoral origin and mainly involves activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. Vagal efferent pathways could be also involved.", 
    "212": "In patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, studies employing a double-blind randomized cross-over factorial design have been used to obtain more precise estimates of the hypotensive and biochemical effects of individual antihypertensive drugs and of their interactions when used in combination. Order and carry-over effects have been controlled. In studies with beta-blockers and diuretics, the hypotensive effects of the individual drugs have been confirmed and in combination their effects are additive. With the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (20 mg daily) the hypotensive effect was additive with that of a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily). When enalapril was combined with the beta-blocker atenolol (50 mg daily) there was little additional hypotensive effect, despite similar hypotensive effects of the individual agents separately. The mechanism of this attenuated effect is unclear. The design is suitable for evaluation of other antihypertensive combinations.", 
    "213": "In the present study the prescription patterns and cost of antihypertensive drugs in two outpatient clinics located in two different countries (Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, and M\u00fcnster, FRG), were analyzed from 1975 till 1985 by using representative random samples of hypertensive outpatients. Throughout the observed period the leading positions were held by diuretics and beta-blockers, whereas central sympatholytics and ganglion blockers nearly disappeared. A rapid increase in the use of calcium antagonists occurred within the last 2 analyzed years. Drugs in fixed combination containing reserpin showed a constant decrease during the observed period, whereas beta-blocker-containing combination drugs increased in both clinics. The comparison between the two clinics revealed only minor differences in the prescription pattern of the various known classes of antihypertensive drugs. However, marked differences were observed within given classes between the preferred products. Both in Z\u00fcrich and M\u00fcnster the mean annual drug cost per patient doubled from 1975 to 1985. Especially during the last few years these changes took place with a remarkable rapidity, obviously the result of a more intense promotion of new antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "214": "1. Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme (ACE) activity has been characterized in the freshwater turtle, Amyda japonica. 2. Peak activity of ACE in plasma from the freshwater turtle was shown at pH 9.0, which was more alkaline compared to that of mammals. 3. Chloride requirements for the optimal ACE activity were different from species. 4. ACE inhibitors, EDTA, teprotide (SQ 20,881), Captopril (SQ 14,225) showed dose-dependent inhibitions of ACE activity in plasma from the freshwater turtle as well as mammals. 5. ACE activity was found in several different tissues with a different activity showing the highest activity in kidney homogenate from the freshwater turtle, Amyda japonica.", 
    "215": "Cardiac tamponade is a spectrum ranging from pericardial effusions with minimal hemodynamic impairment to effusions causing circulatory collapse. In this study, we examined the roles played by the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system in controlling the distribution of blood flow in chronically instrumented conscious dogs during progressive cardiac tamponade. Fifty-one episodes of acute cardiac tamponade were induced to decompensation (decline in mean aortic blood pressure to 70% of the level present when the pericardium was free of fluid) in 6 dogs by intrapericardial infusion of warmed saline solution. Cardiac output (electromagnetic flow probe), intrapericardial pressure, aortic and right atrial blood pressures, and renal, coronary, and mesenteric artery blood flows (Doppler flow probes) were recorded during tamponade in the absence of blockade (control), during alpha-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine), beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol), or angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade (captopril). Aortic and mesenteric artery blood flow decreased progressively during cardiac tamponade regardless of the presence or absence of blockade. Coronary artery blood flow did not significantly change during alpha-adrenergic blockade, suggesting that the continuous decline observed during cardiac tamponade in the absence of blockade was at least in part mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. Renal artery blood flow, in contrast, was well maintained in all situations, confirming the importance of autoregulation in this vascular bed during cardiac tamponade.", 
    "216": "Previous experimental and simulation studies have alluded to the presence of a diffusional barrier for enalaprilat, the polar, dicarboxylic acid metabolite of enalapril, entering hepatocytes. The present study examined the roles of diffusional clearances of drug and metabolite on the distribution and elimination characteristics in liver. The hepatic intrinsic clearances for enalapril (26.1 ml/min) and enalaprilat (0.7 ml/min), found in a previous study, were used for simulation because, along with their given diffusional clearances (75 and 2 ml/min, respectively), they yielded a high extraction ratio for drug (E = 0.86) and a poor extraction ratio for the preformed metabolite (E = 0.05). While maintaining the intrinsic clearances and hepatic blood flow rate (10 ml/min) constant, only drug and metabolite diffusional clearances were altered. The liver was modeled as three (blood, liver tissue, and bile) compartments, with blood flowing into sinusoids of uniform length L. Blood (sinusoidal) and tissue concentrations of drug and generated and preformed metabolites, at any point x along L and under linear kinetic conditions, were approximated numerically by computer simulations and expressed as the length-averaged or mean concentrations. The factors underlying drug and metabolite (preformed and generated) concentrations, hepatic clearances and elimination rates, and their interrelationships were illustrated graphically, emphasizing the roles of diffusional clearances for drug and metabolite on their spatial distributions and elimination in liver.", 
    "217": "Hypertension is very common in the elderly patient with renal insufficiency and may be primary or secondary to the kidney disease. In these patients, hypertension is usually associated with an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and salt sensitivity (the latter related to the degree of renal failure.) Therapy should be tailored to the individual patient, particularly when the elevated blood pressure and renal insufficiency are associated with other significant medical problems. Most of the drugs used in younger hypertensives may be used in the elderly patient with renal insufficiency, but in general, starting and maintenance doses should be lower because of the greater sensitivity due to age and/or the renal failure. The goal in the elderly hypertensive patient with renal failure is similar to that in other hypertensive patients: blood pressure should be brought to 140/90 mm Hg or lower. In the elderly patient with resistant hypertension or who manifests a decrease in kidney function as blood pressure is lowered, an effort must be made to look for associated renovascular disease.", 
    "218": "Brain contains a membrane-bound form of endopeptidase-24.15, a metalloendopeptidase predominantly associated with the soluble protein fraction of brain homogenates. Subcellular fractionation of the enzyme in rat brain showed that 20-25% of the total activity is associated with membrane fractions including synaptosomes. Solubilization of the enzyme from synaptosomal membranes required the use of detergents or treatment with trypsin. The specific activity of the enzyme in synaptosomal membranes measured with tertiary-butoxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate as substrate was higher than that of endopeptidase-24.11 (\"enkephalinase\"), a membrane-bound zinc-metalloendopeptidase believed to function in brain neuropeptide metabolism. Purified synaptosomal membranes converted efficiently dynorphin1-8, alpha- and beta-neoendorphin into leucine enkephalin and methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 into methionine enkephalin in the presence of captopril, bestatin, and N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]-Phe-p-aminobenzoate, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1), aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.2), and membrane-bound metalloendopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11), respectively. The conversion of enkephalin-containing peptides into enkephalins was virtually completely inhibited by N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate, a specific active-site-directed inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.15, indicating that this enzyme was responsible for the observed interconversions. The data indicate that synaptosomal membranes contain enzymes that can potentially generate and degrade both leucine- and methionine-enkephalin.", 
    "219": "Results from both preclinical and clinical studies described here suggest that ACE may have a role in the modulation of cognitive memory processes in the rat and in humans. The finding of improved cognitive performance among patients treated with captopril relative to those treated with propranolol or methyldopa is consistent with other clinical and prec-clinical data. Clinical data derive primarily from quality of life measures based on interviews with patients in the same clinical trial from which our other cognitive data are drawn. For example, mental acuity in the workplace was reported to have improved significantly from baseline to week 24 in patients on captopril (p less than 0.05), although it did not change in patients treated with propranolol and worsened in those receiving methyldopa (Croog et al, 1987). The difference between captopril and methyldopa was significant (p less than 0.01). Pre-clinical data come primarily from studies demonstrating that inhibitors of ACE delay CAE in rats when compared not only with methyldopa, but also with saline (Sudilovsky et al, 1984, 1986). A fundamental question is how could inhibition of ACE improve cognitive functioning independent of blood pressure control. It is known that captopril exerts its antihypertensive effects primarily through inhibition of the ACE and that this is present in the brain as well as in non-neuronal tissues elsewhere (Ganten et al, 1982; Strittmatter et al, 1983, 1984). The activity of the enzyme has been found to be significantly increased in the caudate nucleus, the frontal cortex, parahyppocampal gyrus, and medial hippocampus of patients dying with Alzheimer's disease when compared to age-matched controls (Arregui et al, 1982). In addition, AII has been shown to impair performance on various learning and memory paradigms in animals (Melo and Graeff, 1975; Morgan and Routtenberg, 1977). Raising the level of endogenous AII by intravenous administration of its precursor renin has similar effects, and these are prevented if captopril is administered previously (Koller et al, 1979). Also, chronic oral treatment with captopril produces changes of brain renin angiotensin system parameters which suggest inhibition of AII biosyntheses in the brain (Scholkens et al, 1983). It is conceivable therefore, that our findings with prolonged administration of captopril are exerted through reduced formation of AII. Other possible mechanisms through which captopril may affect cognition include peptide-protein systems (Ganten et al, 1982, Sudilovsky et al, 1988) or the modulation of cerebral blood flow autoregulation mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "220": "The effects of a long-term (7 days) administration of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on the zona glomerulosa were investigated in \"normal\" rats and in animals in which the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenal axis and the renin-angiotensin system had been pharmacologically interrupted. alpha-MSH caused a notable hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its parenchymal cells, as well as a significant increase in the plasma concentration of aldosterone, in rats infused with dexamethasone, dexamethasone plus ACTH or captopril plus angiotensin II, but not in animals treated with captopril alone. These findings indicate that alpha-MSH is directly involved in the stimulation of the growth and steroidogenic capacity of rat zona glomerulosa, and that this action of alpha-MSH requires a normal level of circulating angiotensin II.",

    "222": "The effects of orally administered captopril, enalapril and lisinopril on plasma concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (ANGII) and renin (PRC) were studied over a period of 6 hours in 6 normal subjects. A further 4 subjects received intravenous enalapril and enalaprilic acid (enalaprilat). Captopril (25 mg) by mouth caused a fall in pANGII that reached a nadir 30 to 40 minutes after administration but an effect was hardly apparent after 6 hours. Enalapril (10 mg) by mouth had less marked effects on pACE and pANGII with a decline in levels first apparent 1 hour after administration and the lowest levels reached between 3 and 6 hours. Lisinopril (10 mg) produced a progressive fall in pACE and pANGII from 1 hour to reach the lowest values 6 hours after treatment. Intravenous enalaprilat (5 mg) produced an immediate sustained fall in both pACE and pANGII but intravenous enalapril (7 mg) had a biphasic inhibitory effect.",

Addition of these drugs lowered the blood pressure by 25 +/- 3/16 +/- 2 mm Hg and 15 +/- 3/14 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. The difference of the reduction of the systolic blood pressure between enalapril and timolol group at the end of the combined treatment was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The mean serum potassium was elevated by 0.3 mmol/l after addition of enalapril to the diuretic treatment, but none of the patients developed hyperkalaemia. No adverse effects on other routine laboratory values were observed. Both drug combinations can be considered efficient, well tolerated and safe in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "225": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 32 elderly patients (aged 75-97 years) with uncomplicated essential hypertension, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. It was given over an 8-week period in doses from 20 to 40 mg/day and was compared with an identical placebo. Enalapril caused a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by the 2nd week, an effect that persisted through to the 8th week (190 +/- 16/102 +/- 7 to 151 +/- 19/85 +/- 11 mm Hg); 67% of patients had their pressures normalized (less than 160/95 mm Hg). BP was also significantly decreased by the 8th week under placebo (183 +/- 16/101 +/- 9 to 165 +/-21/91 +/- 13 mm Hg), but only 35% of patients attained a normal pressure. Heart rate did not change with treatment. Enalapril caused an increase in plasma renin activity (1.22 +/- 0.08 to 3.66 +/- 2.50 ng/ml/h), whereas aldosterone levels remained unchanged. There was a mild, significant elevation of creatinine level with enalapril but other laboratory parameters, including serum potassium, were unaltered. Two deaths occurred in the enalapril group, but were not considered to be treatment-related. The drug was otherwise well tolerated. Serum enalapril concentration was assessed in 10 patients taking 20 mg/day over an 8-day period. At equilibrium, the level was 22.3 +/- 5.0 ng/l and it correlated both with converting enzyme inhibition and with renal function. Enalapril is shown to be an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive medication in elderly patients.", 
    "226": "Based on prevailing hypotheses about the role of renin in essential hypertension, both Laragh and Buhler independently predicted that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors would become less effective with increasing age, as elderly hypertensive patients tend to have low plasma renin activity. We have investigated this situation in a large postmarketing surveillance study with enalapril. Following a 2-week no-treatment period, a total of 11,710 patients with essential hypertension received 10-20 mg of enalapril once daily for 6 weeks. BP was measured on two occasions prior to enalapril treatment, and on two occasions during enalapril treatment (after 2 and 6 weeks). Enquiry for symptom events was also made on each of these four occasions. Systolic BP (SBP) prior to enalapril treatment rose steeply with increasing age, whereas diastolic BP (DBP) rose only very slightly with age and reached a plateau by the 5th decade. The fall in SBP in response to enalapril increased with increasing age, but DBP was relatively uninfluenced by age. However, when corrected for initial BP, the percentage changes in both SBP (13%) and DBP (14%) were not different across the age range studied. Prior to receiving enalapril, 67.8% of patients were reporting symptoms, and this showed a positive correlation with age. During enalapril therapy, the overall level of symptom events reported fell significantly in all age groups (35.0%) but more so in the elderly, such that at the end of the study no significant age-related difference was detected. In all age groups, more than half of the events reported during enalapril therapy were of an improvement in general well-being.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The antihypertensive efficacy and safety profiles of lisinopril were assessed in 24 patients (15 men, 9 women; mean age 52.3 years; range 21-75 years) with hypertension associated with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate GFR 60 ml/min or less), in an open study of 12 weeks' duration. Previous antihypertensive drugs were discontinued at entry into the study. Lisinopril was given orally once daily; the starting dose was 2.5 mg in patients with a GFR of less than 30 ml/min, and 5 mg in all other patients. The dosage of lisinopril was titrated upward to 40 mg daily according to BP response. A diuretic could then be added if hypertension was inadequately controlled. Twenty-three patients completed the study. Mean sitting BP was reduced from 177 +/- 21.2/106 +/- 9.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) at entry to the study to 145 +/- 21.4/88 +/- 8.3 mm Hg after 12 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.001). The median dose of lisinopril used was 10 mg (range 2.5-40 mg) and only 4 patients had a diuretic added to the lisinopril. Overall GFR was unchanged during the study: mean baseline value was 37 +/- 16.4 ml/min (range 10-60 ml/min) at the beginning of the study and 40 +/- 21.0 ml/min at the end.

    "228": "One hundred seventy-four patients, 65 years of age or older, entered a double-blind, seven-center, 16-week, controlled study to compare the effects of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in an elderly hypertensive population. Sixty-eight percent of the patients were men, 32% were women. Thirty-two percent of the patients had isolated systolic hypertension. Approximately 80% of the patients were white. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients with sitting diastolic BP (DBP) of 90-120 mm Hg or systolic BP (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 mg Hg and DBP less than 90 mm Hg (isolated systolic hypertension) were randomized to receive 10 mg of enalapril or 12.5 mg of HCTZ once daily. If after 4 weeks their BPs were not controlled (i.e., DBP greater than 85 mm Hg or SBP greater than 140 mm Hg), the dose of the drug was doubled. If after successive 4-week intervals, their BPs were still not controlled, the other drug was added to their regimen and this was then doubled. The initial mean BPs were 167/94 mm Hg in both groups. By the end of the monotherapy phase at 8 weeks, the mean BPs had fallen significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) to 148/85 mm Hg in both groups. By 16 weeks, the mean BPs had again fallen similarly: in the enalapril group to 144/83 mm Hg, and in the HCTZ group to 145/83 mm Hg. Seventy-nine percent of the enalapril group and 85% of the HCTZ group had controlled BPs at this time (DBP less than or equal to 85 or SBP less than or equal to 140 mm Hg). White and nonwhite patients in both drug groups had similar falls in SBP and DBP both at the end of the monotherapy period and the overall study. The white patients experienced more rapid falls in BP with enalapril, the nonwhite patients with HCTZ. Three serious adverse experiences occurred in the enalapril group, none of which were considered likely to be due to the drug therapy. Overall, 49% of the enalapril group and 61% of the HCTZ group reported an adverse effect during the study (not significant). Laboratory adverse effects occurred 10% more frequently in the HCTZ group: enalapril, 22%; HCTZ, 32% (not significant); none was serious. Both drugs therefore appeared to be equally efficacious antihypertensive agents in these elderly patients.", 
    "229": "If optimal dosage administration schedules are to be defined, the factors that influence the disposition of a drug in the population of patients who are likely to receive it should first be determined. Traditionally, separate groups of patients, each with different underlying disease, are given the drug and then detailed studies are performed to assess which groups have significantly different pharmacokinetic parameters and therefore require an adjustment in dose. An alternative approach, utilizing large groups of patients studied less intensively, will be described here. The analysis used the results of two multicenter trials of lisinopril: one in elderly (greater than 65 years) hypertensive patients and one in a group of hypertensive patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance rate less than 60 ml/min). Both protocols allowed for a stepwise increase in the dose of lisinopril until optimum control of BP was achieved. Required dosages ranged from 2.5 to 40 mg/day. During the course of therapy, regular trough concentrations were analyzed to assess compliance and a steady-state profile was determined during one dosage interval. Only patients who appeared to be compliant on the basis of multiple trough concentrations were used in the analysis. Data from a total of 53 patients were used, of whom 35 took part in the elderly study, and 18 in the renal study.

These data were compared with similar data for the study subset of 92 younger patients between the ages of 21 and 45 years (whites, n = 58; blacks, n = 34). The most striking finding was the overall lack of significant differences in response between older and younger patients. There were, however, significant differences in response to therapy between the two racial groups studied. In the older group, normotension was achieved in 66% of white patients and 60% of black patients with a single daily dose of enalapril ranging from 5 to 40 mg; the group means, 13 +/- 1 mg in whites vs 22 +/- 2 mg in blacks, differed significantly (P less than 0.05). Thirty-one percent of older white patients attained normotension with a daily dosage of 5 mg, whereas only 4% of black patients in this age group did so. Only 4% of the older white patients but 24% of the older black patients reached the highest recommended daily dosage of 40 mg of enalapril. Adverse reactions occurred in 11% of the older white patients and 16% of the older black patients (a nonsignificant difference), consisting mostly of gastrointestinal discomfort, malaise, dizziness, and pruritus. There were no significant biochemical abnormalities, the only consistent change being a slight increase in mean plasma potassium from 4.34 to 4.45 mEq/L in older whites (P less than 0.05).

After a two-week washout period, during which placebo was given, the patients received 20 to 40 mg/day of enalapril for 16 weeks. Treatment with enalapril was associated with significant increases in levels of HDL cholesterol (mean, 23%; P less than 0.001) and apoprotein A (mean, 11%; P less than 0.01), largely because of the increase in the subfraction HDL2 (mean, 43%; P less than 0.001), although the subfraction HDL3 also rose (mean, 14%; P less than 0.005). Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels did not change, whereas triglycerides decreased significantly (mean, 26%; P less than 0.001). Apoprotein B was unchanged. Unlike diuretics and most beta-blockers, enalapril favorably affects plasma lipoprotein levels, thus improving the overall cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.", 
    "232": "We investigated the interaction of angiotensin I (AI) converting enzyme (ACE) related substances to prostacyclin (PGI2) generation and ACE activity using cultured human vascular endothelial cells (EC) and rat aortic rings (AR). In case of cultured EC, AI and bradykinin (BK) increased PGI2 generation and at the same time ACE released from EC, however angiotensin II (AII) did not show any effect on both of them. When the EC were pretreated by captopril both of basal PGI2 production and ACE activity were reduced but the enhancing effects on PGI2 generation by AI or BK were preserved. On the other hand in the experimental system with AR, not only AI or BK but also AII increased PGI2 generation and the higher concentration of captopril inhibited PGI2 generation. When the EC were removed, the enhancing effect by AII was diminished and the mechanical stimulation to AR remarkably increased PGI2. From these experimental studies, we obtained the results that (1) the reported hypothesis that the vasodilative effect of captopril would be developed by the enhanced PGI2 generation was not confirmed in our systems of EC and AR. (2) AII did not affect on PGI2 generation of EC. Therefore the enhanced PGI2 generation by AII in AR was considered to be mainly derived from the mechanical stimulation to EC by the AII induced smooth muscle cells contraction. (3) It was speculated that the enhanced PGI2 generation by AI or BK might be modulated through their activating effect on ACE as an autoregulatory mechanism.",

An inhibition of the vasodepressor action of bradykinin by over 50% was found when the bradykinin inhibitor was infused at a rate of 40 micrograms/min, with little difference at higher rates of infusion. We then infused this inhibitor in four groups of renovascular hypertensive rats. In three groups the blood pressure had been decreased by pretreatment either with the converting enzyme inhibitor MK 421, saralasin or sodium nitroprusside, respectively. The fourth group received no pretreatment. Infusion of the inhibitor produced an immediate increase in blood pressure by 30% only in the MK 421 group, but no change in the three other groups. These results indicate that bradykinin is involved in the decrease of blood pressure produced by converting enzyme inhibition in experimental renovascular hypertension.", 
    "234": "The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is of landmark importance in the understanding and treatment of cardiovascular disorders, particularly hypertension and congestive heart failure. Enalapril has recently joined captopril as an approved, orally active ACE inhibitor. Like captopril, it has been effective in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, with minimal adverse reactions noted. Differences in pharmacology exist between enalapril and captopril which may prove to be of clinical significance.", 
    "235": "The case of vasomotor parenchymal acute renal failure is reported in a patient a few days after the initiation of treatment by Enalapril which is a new converting enzyme inhibitor. No renal artery stenosis could be demonstrated, which is in contrast with the numerous cases reported up to now. However the helping roles of an incomplete obstruction by a peri-aneurysmal retroperitoneal sclerosis, of prolonged anterior treatment with flurbiprofen and of simultaneous administration of furosemide may be discussed.", 
    "236": "It is to be expected that in the near future the success or failure of antihypertensive substances will be mainly determined by their spectrum of side effects so long as their antihypertensive efficacy is comparable. This double-blind study with crossover of enalapril and atenolol in 58 mild to moderate hypertensive patients is, as far as we know, the first clinical trial evaluating next to the antihypertensive efficacy also compliance and side effects. On the grounds of excellent compliance results (ca. 95%) blood pressure values as well as the incidence of side effects can be assumed to be accurate. Our results show that the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril is comparable to that of atenolol. The number of patients with side effects did not differ significantly between enalapril and atenolol.", 
    "237": "Sixteen patients with essential hypertension were treated for 2 consecutive 6-week periods with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (20 mg once daily) or the calcium antagonist diltiazem (120 mg twice daily). The sequence of the treatment phases was randomly allocated. Blood pressure decreased from 154/102 +/- 5/2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 135/96 +/- 4/2 and 140/98 +/- 3/2 mm Hg during treatment with enalapril and diltiazem, respectively. It was impossible in the individual hypertensive patient to predict the long-term blood pressure response to one of the agents studied based on the long-term blood pressure response to the other agent.", 
    "238": "Torpedo electric organ contains high concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) like activity, cleaving [Leu5]enkephalin at the Gly3-Phe4 peptide bond. Most of the activity cosediments with the cell membranes. The enzymatic preparation from membranes is inhibited by low concentrations of the ACE inhibitors, SQ 14225 and SQ 20881 (IC50 of 0.6 and 15 nM, respectively), and is weakly inhibited by the neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, phosphoramidon and thiorphan (IC50 of 30 microM and ca. 70 nM, respectively). The enzyme degrades hippuryl-His-Leu and is activated by NaCl. Hippuryl-His-Leu and [Leu5]enkephalin are degraded with Km of 93 and 41 microM, and Vmax of 21 and 10 nmol/mg protein/min, respectively. The specific activity of the ACE-like activity in homogenates of Torpedo electric organ is relatively high (6.3 nmol hippuryl-His-Leu/mg protein/min); this value is similar to that obtained for rat lung and rat striatum.", 
    "239": "When levels of plasma angiotensin converting activity (ACE) were measured in 11 sheep undergoing a 15 ml/kg hemorrhage, levels before hemorrhage (5.7 +/- 0.5 nmol/min/ml) fell significantly at 120 min (3.7 +/- 0.6 nmol/min/ml) and 150 min (3.4 +/- 0.5 nmol/min/ml) after hemorrhage (P less than 0.01). Plasma ACE activity remained constant in ten control sheep studied under the same conditions but not hemorrhaged. The time course of the fall in plasma ACE activity was then studied in an additional four sheep undergoing 15 ml/kg hemorrhage, which reduced mean arterial pressure by 25% at 10 min after hemorrhage. Plasma ACE activity was variable for 60 min post-hemorrhage, but then fell to levels significantly lower than baseline values at 150 min (P less than 0.05). The decrease in plasma ACE activity associated with hemorrhage was small when compared to the effect of an IV infusion of the ACE inhibitor, Captopril (SQ14225, 28 micrograms/min for 3 hr), which reduced plasma ACE activity in the same sheep to almost undetectable levels. These results show that hemorrhage significantly reduces plasma ACE activity in sheep. However, this effect is small and is unlikely to affect the production of plasma AII following acute hemorrhage.", 
    "240": "During chronic chlorthalidone treatment of patients with essential hypertension, distal tubular sodium reabsorption is continuously inhibited. At the same time, sodium balance is maintained by an increase of the proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. In the present study, we investigated whether this increase is caused by a stimulated renin-angiotensin system (RAS). For this purpose, the renal effects of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) were evaluated in 12 patients with essential hypertension who remained hypertensive despite chronic chlorthalidone treatment. After 6 weeks of chlorthalidone, an intravenous injection of 10 mg enalaprilic acid decreased the mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 110 to 102 mm Hg. The effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased. However, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the fractional excretions of sodium, lithium and free water did not change significantly. After 2 additional weeks of chlorthalidone combined with enalapril 20 mg b.i.d., MAP fell to 90 mm Hg, ERPF remained elevated and plasma aldosterone concentration decreased. As in the acute study, no significant changes were detected in the GFR and the fractional excretions of sodium, lithium or free water. Extracellular fluid volume was not diminished during these 2 weeks. Fractional proximal sodium reabsorption during chronic chlorthalidone therapy was higher when calculated from free water clearance (91%) than from the lithium clearance (71%), but neither of the two were affected by acute or chronic CEI. The results of this study suggest that during chronic diuretic treatment, maintenance of sodium balance by increased proximal reabsorption is not dependent on the stimulated RAS, or alternatively, that this function of the RAS is exactly counterbalanced by another effect of CEI, possibly by the fall in blood pressure.", 
    "241": "Enalapril maleate (MK-421) is a new non-sulfhydryl-containing converting-enzyme inhibitor that has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in patients with essential hypertension. Data on its effectiveness and safety in patients with renovascular hypertension are limited and have involved predominantly short-term observations. This is particularly true with respect to the long-term effects of enalapril on renal function. We report our experience using the combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in a group of nine patients with moderate to severe hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis. The enalapril-HCTZ combination successfully controlled blood pressure in seven patients during a six-week period of study. Adverse effects were not noted, and detailed renal hemodynamic studies did not reveal any significant changes of renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate during this time interval. Five patients were continued on this regimen for a period of six to 18 months. In this group of patients, the regimen continued to be well tolerated and to provide excellent blood pressure control: glomerular filtration rate was maintained in two patients and variable grades of decrease were noted in three. The mechanism of this delayed renal dysfunction as well as its relationship to enalapril treatment remain unclear. The long-term impact of converting-enzyme inhibition on renal function requires further study.", 
    "242": "The anticonvulsant effect of compounds that inhibit peptidyl-dipeptidase (PDP) on bicuculline (BIC)- and strychnine (STRYC)-induced seizures was assessed after intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intraperitoneal (IP) administration in Swiss albino mice. STRYC-induced seizures were delayed by ICV injections and high IP doses of captopril, but not by ICV or IP injections of enalapril or by lower doses of captopril (0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg IP). BIC-induced seizures were not suppressed by ICV or IP injections of either compound; on the contrary, captopril and enalapril exhibited proconvulsant effects when given IP or ICV by shortening the time of onset of tonic seizures and death. Results indicate that the anticonvulsant effect of captopril against STRYC-induced seizures is not mediated by central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors or by the inhibition of PDP.", 
    "243": "1. The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril on plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptides (VIP) and plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine were studied in 12 patients with congestive heart failure over two consecutive 48-hr periods. The first day in each period served as a treatment day and the second as a control day. 2. A parallel monitoring was made of various hormonal parameters related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and a right-heart catheter was used to monitor haemodynamics at rest. 3. Potent inhibition of the renin-system (as demonstrated by decreases in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone) together with improved haemodynamics (decreases in mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean systemic arterial pressure) were recorded. 4. Plasma VIP was significantly increased by a mean of 20.3% (P less than 0.01) on the lisinopril treatment days compared with the control days, whereas circulating catecholamines showed no significant pattern of change. 5. It is postulated that the potent vasodilatory neuromodulator VIP is implicated in the ACE inhibitor effects. 6. The ACE is a non-specific peptidase that previously has been implicated in the potentiation of other vasoactive endogenous systems (kinins and enkephalins).", 
    "244": "Total and active renin were measured in plasma of 6 normal volunteers before and after acute and sustained angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with CGS 14824A (2 mg and 10 mg p.o. q.d.) or placebo treatment. The same sandwich technique was used for the measurement of both total and active renin using a polyacrylamide-iron-oxide linked monoclonal antibody to trap renin and 125I-labelled second monoclonal antirenin antibodies without or with specificity for active renin. Normal values for supine subjects ranged for active renin between less than 3 pg/ml and 28 pg/ml and for total renin between 73 and 263 pg/ml. Plasma ACE activity was clearly suppressed during 24 hours following both 2 mg and 10 mg CGS 14824A. Active plasma renin reached 6- and 12-fold normal values on days 1 and 7 of treatment with the 10 mg dose. Total renin rose to 150% and 228% respectively at the same time. Inactive renin continued rising during the first day of 10 mg CGS treatment to a final 141% at 24 hours post-drug and didn't change on day 7. Plasma renin activity correlated well with active renin levels (r = 0.92). We conclude that both total and active plasma renin concentrations can now be directly measured with great accuracy within 6 hours.", 
    "245": "Evidence from the experimental and clinical laboratory suggests that the heart failure state is characterized not only by an excessive degree of systemic vasoconstriction but also by an exaggerated neurohormonal response to the decline in cardiac performance. Therapeutic interventions directed only at the first abnormality may serve to exacerbate the second, and thus may fail to produce long-term hemodynamic and clinical benefits. Converting-enzyme inhibitors successfully antagonize both homeostatic malfunctions, and thus are among the few vasodilators that have been shown to produce consistent circulatory and symptomatic improvement in patients with severe chronic heart failure in controlled clinical trials; the responses to treatment with these agents have been superior to those seen during therapy with placebo or other vasodilator drugs. Furthermore, experimental and clinical evidence suggests that converting-enzyme inhibitors exert favorable effects on the survival of patients with severe heart failure; this potential has now been confirmed in a large-scale, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial. Despite its benefits, converting-enzyme inhibition may be accompanied by adverse circulatory and metabolic reactions (symptomatic hypotension, renal insufficiency, and potassium retention), which are predictable consequences of interference with the homeostatic role of angiotensin II in low-output states.", 
    "246": "To investigate the influence of local cardiac converting enzyme (CE) inhibition on the effects of angiotensin I (ANG I), ANG II, and bradykinin (BK), experiments were performed in ischemic isolated perfused working rat hearts. Acute regional myocardial ischemia was induced by 15 min occlusion of the left coronary artery followed by reperfusion. In ischemic isolated rat hearts, perfusion with ramiprilat (100 ng/ml, 2.58 x 10(-7) mol/l), the active moiety of the CE inhibitor ramipril, after coronary occlusion protected against ventricular fibrillation that invariably occurred in untreated control hearts in the reperfusion period. Addition of ANG I and ANG II to the perfusate enhanced, whereas BK reduced postischemic reperfusion arrhythmias, which were almost abolished in the hearts from ramipril (1 mg/kg p.o.) pretreated rats. Perfusion with ANG I and ANG II reduced cardiac function and coronary flow, increased the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in the perfusate, and decreased high-energy-rich phosphates and glycogen in the myocardium. In contrast, BK reduced the enzymatic activities in the perfusate and improved the metabolic parameters in the myocardium. In hearts from ramipril pretreated animals, the ANG I effects were abolished, whereas the ANG II actions remained unchanged. The results of these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of CE inhibitors on ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac function, and metabolism are due to local interference with CE in the coronary vascular wall or heart tissue and subsequent reduction of local ANG II generation and BK degradation.", 
    "247": "The renin-angiotensin system has a wide range of physiological actions, and thus interference with the system has attractive therapeutic potential. The orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have so far been the most successful drugs in this area. They lower arterial pressure both in renovascular and essential hypertension, and their effects are enhanced by concomitant diuretic therapy or dietary salt restriction. Since, in renovascular hypertension, the affected kidney depends on enhanced local generation of angiotensin II to help preserve its function, the circulation and excretory capacity of this kidney may be compromised with ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors can improve exercise tolerance and diminish cardiac ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure. Because these drugs lower plasma aldosterone, they tend to correct potassium deficiency and hypokalemia, which may have been induced by diuretic treatment. Hypotension can occur with the first dose of ACE inhibitor, especially in sodium-depleted subjects; in patients on prior antihypertensive therapy, particularly if this includes a diuretic; and in the elderly. Not all of the actions of ACE inhibitors are necessarily due to lowering of plasma angiotensin II: accumulation of kinins may be responsible for some of the effects and side effects. Common to all ACE inhibitors are occasional rashes, cough, and, more rarely, angioedema. Apparently peculiar to captopril, and less often seen with the lower doses now employed, are taste disturbance, proteinuria, and marrow depression. ACE inhibitors, should not be used in pregnant women.", 
    "248": "A stepped-care approach to the treatment of hypertension has been developed to provide some practical guidelines for practicing physicians. Obviously, only drugs that are effective as monotherapy, and that are particularly well tolerated and safe, can be recommended for the use in the first step. In this discussion, evidence is provided in favor of using ACE inhibitors as first-step agents. They are effective in a large fraction of hypertensive patients when given as monotherapy and they are well tolerated even in the presence of associated diseases. They have a favorable hemodynamic profile, induce no tolerance, and can be combined with almost any other drug. They elicit few side effects, many of which are due to inadequate handling of the agents by the physician, and they appear to provide in general a particularly good quality of life to the patient.", 
    "249": "The interaction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with ramiprilat was studied at pH 7.5 in the presence of 300 mmol/l sodium chloride with furanacryloyl-Phe-Gly-Gly as substrate. Ramiprilat inhibits ACE with a Ki value of 7 pmol/l. It is both a slow- and tight-binding inhibitor; the mode of inhibition is fully competitive. Binding of ramiprilat to ACE proceeds by a two-step mechanism E + I in equilibrium EI in equilibrium EI* in which the inhibitor rapidly binds to enzyme to form an initial enzyme-inhibitor complex, which then undergoes a slow isomerization. The interaction of ramiprilat with ACE is compared to that of two other potent inhibitors, captopril and enalaprilat.", 
    "250": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the receptor for an important new class of antihypertensive drugs, is now one of the better studied zinc metallopeptidases. The development of several classes of tightly binding competitive inhibitors of ACE has led to increased understanding of the structure and function of this enzyme while also yielding important new drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertensive disease. Peptides from snake venom provided the first proof of the therapeutic utility of ACE inhibitors, and a tripeptide sequence, Phe-Ala-Pro, was used as a model for sidechain interactions with ACE in the rational design of simpler nonpeptidic inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril. These and more recently developed ACE inhibitors can be classified according to their structural analogy to dipeptides or tripeptides and according to the nature of their zinc-binding ligands, such as sulfhydryl, ketone, carboxylate, or hydroxyphosphinyl, that contribute greatly to their binding to ACE. Several newer ACE inhibitors have increased potency and/or improved pharmacokinetic properties due to modifications such as substitution of the proline ring or replacement of the methyl side chain analogous to Ala by an aminobutyl residue analogous to Lys. The availability of structurally diverse ACE inhibitors with great potency and specificity provides a powerful biochemical tool for purification, localization, and characterization of ACE in different tissues, and for distinguishing related zinc metallopeptidases with similar properties.", 
    "251": "We investigated the possibility that angiotensin II (ANGII) augments the sensitivity of the pituitary to corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) by comparing, in patients with essential hypertension, the responses of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, aldosterone, and renin activity to a bolus injection of either 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg of synthetic ovine CRF in control conditions and after chronic treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril to block the formation of ANGII; the effects of CRF were examined up to 4 h after its administration. In control studies, we found that the two doses of CRF induced similar increments in ACTH and cortisol, the levels of which remained elevated throughout the studies; these changes were associated with increments in plasma aldosterone that were dose dependent, less pronounced, and of shorter duration and with a slight decrease in plasma renin activity. Captopril treatment increased basal plasma renin activity and lowered plasma aldosterone while leaving basal ACTH and cortisol unchanged. During converting enzyme inhibition, the responses of ACTH and cortisol to CRF were similar to those observed in control studies, whereas the changes in plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity were, respectively, smaller and greater. From these results, it appears that during ANGII blockade the sensitivity of ACTH to CRF stimulation is unaffected, whereas that of the adrenals to ACTH is selectively reduced at the level of the zona glomerulosa.", 
    "252": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of enalapril administered once daily (q.d.), and to assess the effectiveness of enalapril in achieving sustained blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The study population comprised 15 patients with uncomplicated, moderate essential hypertension whose blood pressure (BP) was not adequately controlled on hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) monotherapy. Enalapril 10-40 mg q.d. produced a significant fall in supine and erect BP (24 h after enalapril) that persisted during 1 year of combination therapy with HCTZ and enalapril. Blood pressure 6 h after enalapril was significantly lower than BP measured 24 h after enalapril, and occasionally at hypotensive levels. Plasma angiotensin II concentration fell significantly after enalapril with reciprocal increases in the plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin I. The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system was maintained throughout the study. Bradykinin could not be detected in venous blood at any time during the study. We conclude that combination therapy with HCTZ and enalapril once daily is a rational, simple, and effective treatment in patients with moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "253": "This randomized, double blind study compared the antihypertensive effects of enalapril to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in the elderly. One hundred seventy-four patients with diastolic blood pressures (DBP) of 90-120 mm Hg or isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) (systolic BP greater than 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg) were studied. After four weeks of placebo, patients received either enalapril 10 mg or HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily. If the BP was uncontrolled (DBP greater than 85 mm Hg or SBP greater than 140 mm Hg) after 4 weeks, the dose was doubled. At 8 weeks, if necessary, the other drug could be added at the lower dose, then doubled 4 weeks later. Two-thirds of the patients had essential hypertension (EH), the rest ISH; 68% were male and 80% Caucasian. The baseline BPs were 167/94 mm Hg in both groups, at 8 weeks the mean BPs were 148/85 mm Hg in both groups (p less than or equal to 0.01), and at the end of the study the BPs with enalapril were 144/83 mm Hg and with HCTZ they were 145/83 mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.01). The Caucasians showed greater BP falls on enalapril than HCTZ after 4 weeks (p less than or equal to 0.05). The SBP falls for the ISH (-22 mm Hg) and EH (-23 mm Hg) groups were similar at the end of the study. Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Laboratory adverse experiences (AEs) were 9% more common in the HCTZ patients (n.s.). Enalapril and HCTZ both seem to be effective antihypertensive agents in the elderly.", 
    "254": "Lisinopril (L), a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was studied as sole drug in the management of hypertensive, dialysis-treated, end-stage renal failure patients to assess its efficiency, tolerance, and removal by dialysis. High blood pressure (BP) was defined as sitting diastolic (D) BP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg. Ten patients, two females and eight males, were treated for 12 weeks. Their features were age 49 +/- 14 years; dialysis duration 43 +/- 25 months; body weight 61 +/- 10 kg; and body mass index 21.7 +/- 3 (mean +/- SD). Serum L concentrations were measured regularly by radioimmunoassay, both before and after dialysis, which was performed with Cuprophane membranes three times per week. L, 2.5 mg orally, was given every 24 h initially; in six patients, dosage was decreased to an alternate or once-a-week schedule, because of a hypotensive effect during dialysis. At 12 weeks, BP--as compared to prestudy BP--was decreased in eight of nine patients (one patient had been withdrawn after kidney transplantation), and not changed in one patient (mean +/- SD): sitting DBP from 107 +/- 7 to 87 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.001; erect DBP from 105 +/- 5 to 86 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.001. L serum concentration was decreased by dialysis, the mean ratio of post-/predialysis serum L concentrations was 0.47 +/- 0.07 (n = 67). No side effects were disclosed, except for three patients, in whom hemoglobin decreased, while two of them also received quinine for a febrile illness of viral origin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "255": "Enalapril either alone or with a diuretic was administered to 15 children with various renal diseases and hypertension. Five were transplant recipients on multiple immunosuppressive agents. No adverse clinical or laboratory experiences were encountered except for mild proteinuria in two children, one of whom has evidence of chronic rejection. Enalapril effectively controlled blood pressure in all 15 patients when given once daily with or without food. Renal function improved in seven children. Six children are under excellent blood pressure control despite a reduction in the dose of enalapril. Two are currently on no medication, five require a diuretic, while one child is on an increased dose of enalapril.", 
    "256": "The effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), before and after converting enzyme (CE) inhibition, was investigated in six primary hypertensive patients taking a constant diet. In this placebo-controlled, single-blind, randomized study, the patients received, on three different days, i.v. infusions of (a) placebo, or (b) alpha-human ANP, 150 micrograms over 30 min, or (c) alpha-human ANP after acute CE inhibition by enalapril (EN) 20 mg P.O., 4 h before ANP infusion. ANP infusion increased urinary sodium (p less than 0.001) and volume excretion. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, stroke volume and shortening fraction (echocardiography), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone did not change significantly. Urinary norepinephrine and dopamine were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) after ANP infusion. BP was significantly reduced after EN in every patient (p less than 0.05). ANP infusion during CE inhibition induced a more sustained increase of sodium excretion and diuresis with respect to ANP infusion alone (p less than 0.05). PRA was significantly reduced while no further reduction of BP was observed. These data suggest that CE inhibition may increase the natriuretic and diuretic effect of ANP in hypertensive patients.", 
    "257": "The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on renal and cardiac hemodynamics was studied in patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension, in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril (LIS) and nifedipine (NIF). After a 2 week placebo run-in period, 15 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either LIS (20-80 mg q.d., n = 10) or NIF (20-40 mg b.i.d., n = 5). LIS significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) without changing heart rate or cardiac output. LIS significantly increased renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not changed. It can be concluded that LIS is an effective antihypertensive agent with a favorable renal hemodynamic profile.", 
    "258": "The acute effects and pharmacokinetic properties of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, and its potent active diacid metabolite, ramiprilate, were investigated. Hypertensive patients with impaired renal function (IRF; n = 6) and with normal renal function (NRF; n = 5) were studied. The terminal half-life of ramiprilate in IRF was longer than that in NRF. The peak plasma concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilate in IRF were higher than those in NRF. The area under the plasma level-time curves of ramipril and ramiprilate in IRF were greater than those in NRF. A significant inverse correlation was found between creatinine clearance and area under the plasma level-time curve.", 
    "259": "Acute effects of piretanide, a loop diuretic, on blood pressure (BP) and urinary output as well as long-term effects on serum electrolytes were compared in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to that of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) both given alone and in combination with the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitor ramipril. There were no acute or chronic falls in BP with low doses of either diuretic. Ramipril at a dose of 10 mg/kg normalized BP, which was accompanied by initial natriuresis and, over the long term, K+ preservation. Minimally effective doses of piretanide but not HCT given in combination with 1 mg/kg ramipril produced a greater fall in BP both acutely and chronically than ramipril alone at unaltered K+ preservation. To match this fall in BP with HCT, large doses were required, which caused hemoconcentration and impaired K+ preservation.", 
    "260": "To establish if physiological manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system modulates tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), rats were fed low, normal, or high salt diets, or high salt and DOCA, for 3 weeks, and then plasma and tissue ACE levels were determined by radioinhibitor binding studies. Urinary sodium excretion (mmol/24 h) was 0.03 +/- 0.01 (low salt), 0.58 +/- 0.09 (normal salt), and 10.4 +/- 1.3 (high salt), and plasma angiotensin II (pg/ml) was 73.5 +/- 8.6 (low salt), 49.3 +/- 8.5 (normal salt), 32.2 +/- 8.5 (high salt), and 6.9 +/- 0.6 (high salt plus DOCA) in the third week of dietary treatment. ACE was studied by Scatchard analysis of radioinhibitor binding in plasma and tissue homogenates. [125I]MK351A bound to ACE was measured under standardized conditions in the presence of MK351A (10(-13) to 10(-5) M) and MK351A binding sites and equilibrium dissociation constant calculated. There were no significant changes in binding site concentration in plasma, lung, aorta, epididymus, brain, or kidney preparations across the range of salt states studied. The equilibrium dissociation constant appeared uniform within organs, but varied between organs. Further studies were undertaken with captopril, enalapril, and cilazoprilic acid in kidney and lung preparations. Concentration of inhibitor required for equal displacement of bound [125I]MK351A was consistently greater for kidney than for lung. Binding studies of rat ACE using [125I]MK351A showed that manipulation of salt status did not influence rat tissue ACE. Binding data suggest ACE from different tissues may have variations at the active site.", 
    "261": "The role of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system on the control of renal blood flow in the rabbit was pursued in this investigation. Blood pressure (BP) and renal blood flow (RBF) were monitored in New Zealand white rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbital. Control RBF and changes in RBF elicited by infusions of angiotensin I (AI) were determined by electromagnetic flowmetry. In Group 1 (n = 7), BP and RBF responses to AI infused i.a. and i.v. were evoked in the control period and the effects of a low i.a. dose of captopril to inhibit selectively renal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and then a high i.a. dose to inhibit maximally renal ACE were determined. Low dose captopril depressed the RBF response to i.a. AI by 67% without an effect on the response to i.v. AI. RBF was increased by 15.0% and renal vascular resistance (RVR) was decreased by 14.4% by low dose captopril. High dose captopril had no further effect on the response to i.a. AI, but decreased the RBF response to i.v. AI by 72%. RBF and RVR were further changed by high dose captopril. In Groups 2 and 3, high dose captopril was administered after either indomethacin or saline vehicle. Captopril increased RBF, decreased RVR, and blocked responses to AI similarly whether prostaglandin synthesis was inhibited or not. The results indicate that renal vasodilation in the rabbit can be produced by selective renal ACE inhibition with a low dose of captopril, but that systemic ACE inhibition also contributes to this effect when a high dose is given.", 
    "262": "The interaction of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) ramipril with sympathetic neurotransmission and the baroreceptor reflex (BRR) was investigated in conscious stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of ramipril (100 micrograms) attenuated the pressor responses to i.v. noradrenaline (NA) in SHRSP and WKY rats. Ganglionic blockade was performed with pentolinium (10 mg/kg i.v.), and blood pressure (BP) was subsequently supported with i.v. NA (1 microgram/min), angiotensin II (ANG II, 500 ng/min), or NA plus a subpressor dose (0.1 ng/min) of ANG II. Intravenous injection of ramiprilat (100 micrograms) significantly decreased NA-supported BP in SHRSP and WKY rats for more than 30 min, but did not lower BP in rats supported with ANG II or with NA plus a subpressor dose of ANG II. In SHRSP and WKY rats pretreated intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with ramiprilat (0.5 microgram/min for 30 min), the slope of the BRR curve between increases in systolic BP and prolongation in pulse interval following bolus i.v. injections of methoxamine (10-100 micrograms/kg) was steeper than in vehicle-pretreated controls. In contrast, i.v. pretreatment with the same dose of the CEI did not increase BRR sensitivity. Our data in conscious animals demonstrate that CEI can interfere acutely with the autonomic nervous system through postsynaptic inhibition of neurotransmission and sensitization of the baroreceptor reflex. The relevance of this mechanisms for the chronic antihypertensive actions of CEI remains to be established.", 
    "263": "It has been reported that acute administration of captopril is followed by a decrease of norepinephrine (NE) release from the sympathetic nerves. Therefore, we studied the interactions between converting enzyme (CE) blocking agents and the presynaptic sympathetic nervous system after chronic administration of various CE inhibitors. Captopril, enalapril, and ramipril were administered orally to male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for 14 days. As parameters for catecholamine biosynthesis and storage, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and the catecholamine content of the hearts and the adrenal medulla were measured by high performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) in treated and control SHR. As an index of sympathetic outflow, plasma NE and epinephrine (E) levels were determined during preganglionic stimulation (PS) of the spinal cord. After chronic administration, no differences between the treated and control animals could be observed, either in the biosynthesis and storage of catecholamines in the heart and adrenal medulla or in the sympathetic outflow. However, after acute infusion of ramipril, a significant decrease in NE release was obtained. The dose-response curves of blood pressure vs. PS were significant shifted to the right when CE inhibitors were administered. It is suggested that the acute effect of CE inhibition on NE and E release (decreased sympathetic outflow) is blunted after long-term treatment with CE inhibitors because of increased angiotensin I (Ang I) and probably bradykinin. Both are capable of releasing NE and E at least from the adrenal medulla, like angiotensin II (Ang II).", 
    "264": "Enalapril (MK-421), a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, reduces the blood pressure in one-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats at 30 mg/kg p.o. (n = 12). On the fifth day and during the fifth week after renal artery constriction, systolic blood pressure decreased from 196 +/- 4 and 240 +/- 5 mm Hg pretreatment to 159 +/- 8 and 225 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively) and was maintained at this level for about 8 h. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by enalapril. Similarly, enalapril (30 mg/kg p.o.) in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats (n = 18) on the fifth day and during the fifth week after operation resulted in a decrease in blood pressure from 162 +/- 5 and 217 +/- 5 mm Hg to 117 +/- 6 and 120 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively, to the preoperative normotensive level (113 +/- 1 mm Hg). These results indicate that the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats. However, in the pathogenesis of one-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats, other mechanisms seem to be involved besides the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "265": "Perindopril is a new inhibitor of converting enzyme activity with a prolonged half-life. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension and a diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg were stratified into two groups according to their 24 h urine sodium excretion. They were randomized in a double-blind fashion to placebo or perindopril and a dose titration made in steps of 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg given once daily at weekly intervals. The goal diastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg. Goal blood pressure was achieved in 11 of 16 patients on perindopril and 3 of 6 patients on placebo. Perindopril caused a fall in BP of 22/11 (supine) and 27/14 (erect) mm Hg while the placebo group had falls of 3/2 (supine) and 3/0 (erect) mm Hg. Most of the blood pressure fall occurred in the first week of therapy with 2 mg/day. Side effects were few and occurred mainly in the placebo phase. There was no alteration in urine protein, white cell count, plasma urea, or creatinine. The fall in blood pressure achieved at the end of the titration or with 2 mg did not differ between the two groups. There was no correlation between blood pressure response and 24 h urine sodium or plasma renin activity. These results indicate that perindopril is an effective antihypertensive drug that appears to work equally well in patients on high or low sodium intake.", 
    "266": "The effects of angiotensin I (ANG I) converting enzyme (ACE)-related substances on prostacyclin (PGI2) generation were investigated using cultured human vascular endothelial cells (EC) and rat aortic rings. ANG I or bradykinin (BK) increased while captopril decreased PGI2 generation and ACE activity of EC, whereas ANG II was without effect. The enhancement of PGI2 generation induced by ANG I or BK was not affected by the pretreatment with captopril. In rat aortic rings, ANG I, ANG II, and BK enhanced whereas captopril (10(-3) M) attenuated PGI2 generation. Mechanical stimulation of aortic rings stimulated PGI2 generation. These results suggest that (a) the conversion of ANG I to ANG II did not enhance PGI2 generation in EC; (b) the ANG II stimulated PGI2 generation of aortic rings was partially derived by mechanical stimulation of EC, probably originating from the contraction of smooth muscle cells by ANG II; (c) captopril directly inhibited PGI2 generation; and (d) in EC, the stimulation of PGI2 generation by ANG I or BK is probably regulated by an activating effect on ACE as an autoregulatory mechanism.", 
    "267": "The interactions of the converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin with cardiac autonomic neuroeffector transmission were investigated in guinea pig isolated atria. Noradrenergic transmitter stores were radiolabeled by incubation with [3H]-noradrenaline. In other atria, cholinergic transmitter stores were radiolabeled by incubation with [3H]-choline. Neither captopril nor enalaprilat significantly altered the resting or stimulation-induced (2 Hz, 30 s) efflux of radioactivity in atria that had been incubated with either [3H]-noradrenaline or [3H]-choline. Saralasin also did not significantly alter the resting or stimulation-induced efflux in atria incubated with [3H]-choline. However, in atria incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline, saralasin slightly increased the resting efflux without altering the stimulation-induced efflux. The findings of the present study suggest that neither captopril, enalaprilat, nor saralasin interferes with either noradrenergic or cholinergic transmitter release.",

SCH 33844 diacid inhibited hydrolysis of hip-his-leu by rabbit lung ACE in a potent (Ki = 0.74 nM), selective, and noncompetitive fashion. SCH 33844 (0.03-1 mg/kg p.o.) produced dose-related inhibition of angiotensin I (AI) pressor responses in conscious rats with a duration of 24 h at the higher dose. SCH 33844 (0.3-30 mg/kg p.o.) reduced blood pressure in a dose-related manner in conscious SHR with a 24-h duration. Antihypertensive activity was enhanced in the presence of hydrochlorothiazide. The drug (1-10 mg/kg p.o.) also lowered blood pressure in conscious hydrochlorothiazide-treated normotensive dogs. In anesthetized dogs, SCH 33844 (1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance and slightly increased cardiac output and stroke volume. These results suggest that peripheral vasodilation is the primary mechanism of the antihypertensive action. The metabolic profile of SCH 33844 was evaluated in dogs and rats. The compound was absorbed in a dose-proportional manner and excreted primarily as the diacid form. In contrast to captopril and enalapril, most of the drug (67%) was excreted into the feces following i.v. dosing. Chronic toxicological evaluation in dogs and rats demonstrated that the drug was relatively devoid of toxicity at oral doses as high as 400 and 450 mg/kg/day, respectively. Slight decreases in heart weight (rats) and increases in granularity of the juxtaglomerular apparatus were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "269": "Hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with a variety of complications including congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease. Unloading the system in time by antihypertensive drug treatment should prevent or reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Although most antihypertensive agents can control blood pressure in a majority of patients, only a select subset of these pharmacologic agents will reverse left ventricular mass. There is evidence to suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can play an important role in protecting the heart during the various phases of evolution of hypertensive heart disease both acutely and on a long-term basis. Several studies in hypertensive humans and experimental animals have documented the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in reducing cardiac hypertrophy. In hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, the ACE inhibitor captopril 3 and 9 months after starting treatment significantly reduced left ventricular mass as well as left ventricular posterior wall and septal wall thickness. The mechanism of regression of left ventricular mass by ACE inhibition is speculative. The absence of a reflex hyperadrenergic state in the face of blood pressure control may be of importance. In addition, interference with angiotensin II generation by these agents may also play a role either through the myocardial effects of angiotensin II on protein synthesis or because of its facilitation of cardiac sympathetic neurotransmitter release. ACE inhibition appears to be associated with the maintenance of normal coronary flow reserve and in high renin states ACE inhibition may increase coronary blood flow. ACE inhibitors are also indicated under conditions of hypertensive heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "270": "Since left ventricular hypertrophy is considered to be a precursor of later hypertensive heart failure, a treatment that can prevent or even reverse myocardial hypertrophy is a highly desirable goal. In order to evaluate which type of antihypertensive treatment is able to induce regression of hypertensive hypertrophy, experimental and clinical studies were performed. Experimental studies were performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Left ventricular hypertrophy and pumping function were studied after antihypertensive treatment with a beta-receptor blocker (metoprolol), an arteriolar vasodilator (hydralazine), and a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) had been instituted for a period of 20-40 weeks. Patients with hemodynamically compensated hypertensive heart disease were treated with a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), an antisympathetic agent (clonidine), and prazosin. Comparing the amount of blood pressure reduction with the extent of hypertrophy reversal, nifedipine, prazosin, and enalapril were equipotent, whereas clonidine was most efficient in this respect. Muscle mass was overproportionally reduced in relation to blood pressure reduction following treatment with clonidine. It is likely that this was caused by lowered catecholamine levels secondary to clonidine therapy. Left ventricular pumping function was enhanced as a result of a reduction in left ventricular afterload, whereas myocardial contractility was found to be unchanged.", 
    "271": "We have shown previously that both sinoaortic denervation (SAD) and high renin hypertension in the rat produce a pronounced alteration in the pattern of pressure change during sleep, namely from unchanged to a rise in pressure during synchronized sleep (SS) and from a slight rise to a marked fall during desynchronized sleep (DS). Since acute SAD also produces overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), we investigated if this overactivity is essential for the development of the alterations. In rats studied 1 day after SAD (138 +/- 1.0 mm Hg) the MAP rose during SS (+14 +/- 0.7 vs. +1.0 +/- 0.16 mm Hg in the controls) and fell during DS (-27.2 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.6 mm Hg in the controls). Captopril-treated rats, studied 1 day after SAD (89 +/- 1.2 mm Hg), also exhibited rise in pressure during SS (+12.3 +/- 0.6 mm Hg) and fall during DS (-12.8 +/- 1.7 mm Hg). Similar alterations were observed in rats studied 10 days after SAD (116 +/- 0.7 mm Hg) when RAS activity was normal (PRA: 1.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 10.4 +/- 2.7 ng AI/ml/h for SAD-1 day); the MAP rose during SS (+6.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg) and fell during DS (-5.0 +/- 0.9 mm Hg). These data indicate that impairment of the baroreceptor function per se determines the typical alteration in the pattern of pressure change during sleep in the rat.", 
    "272": "Substance P (SP) plays an important role in central nervous and peripheral blood pressure regulation. Its effects include modulating influence on the adrenergic system and inhibition of stress-induced plasma noradrenaline increase in animal studies. In patients with essential hypertension (n = 45, WHO stages 1 and 2) the SP-like immunoreactivity (SPLIR) was found significantly (p less than 0.01) lower (1.36 +/- 0.23 pg/100 microliters) than in 24 normotensive subjects (4.54 +/- 0.72 pg/100 microliters). Furthermore, the influence of a mental stress test on SPLIR was investigated in patients with essential hypertension (n = 11, WHO stage 1) and compared with nine normotensive subjects. Whereas in normotensive subjects plasma SP increased under a standardized mental arithmetic test (4.03 +/- 0.48 to 4.74 +/- 0.56 pg/100 microliters), in hypertensive patients a decrease of SP from lower baseline levels (2.85 +/- 0.54 to 2.57 +/- 0.54 pg/100 microliters) was demonstrated. The significantly different changes of plasma SP in normotensive and hypertensive subjects under mental stress conditions had the opposite direction in comparison with the adrenergic reaction [higher and prolonged increase of plasma noradrenaline (NA) in the hypertensive group]. Under antihypertensive drug treatment with prazosin (4.5 mg/day, n = 10) or with captopril (450 mg/day, n = 10) an increase of plasma SP was registered. The results support the participation of SP in the pathogenesis of human hypertension and in therapeutic mechanisms. Lower plasma levels and decreased responsiveness of SP possibly represent the enhanced stress sensitivity in primary hypertension.", 
    "273": "Lisinopril, a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine in its retard formulation, were compared as monotherapy in a group of 45 patients with essential hypertension. Lisinopril in single daily doses (range 20-80 mg, median dose 40 mg) and nifedipine retard in twice daily doses (total daily dose range 40-80 mg, median dose 60 mg) were equally effective in controlling hypertension. The lisinopril group (n = 30), at baseline supine blood pressure 178/109 +/- 23/9 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 SD), after 12 weeks' therapy measured 148/88 +/- 27/14 mm Hg; the nifedipine group (n = 15), at baseline 185/110 +/- 23/11 mm Hg, after 12 weeks' therapy measured 151/89 +/- 14/10 mm Hg. The number of patients who experienced clinical adverse effects was significantly greater in the nifedipine group: 8 of 15 (53%) compared to 4 of 30 (13%) in the lisinopril group. The commonest adverse effects of patients on nifedipine were swollen ankles, flushing, and headache. Two patients on nifedipine were withdrawn from the study because of their adverse experiences. Of the patients on lisinopril there were single reports of flushing, ankle swelling, tiredness, and chest pain. No patient withdrew from lisinopril because of an adverse experience. No adverse laboratory experiences were recorded in either group. In conclusion, lisinopril and nifedipine retard were equally effective in controlling essential hypertension. Lisinopril was, however, better tolerated during this study.",

The patients were studied after a 3 week washout period. At a 48 h interval, each patient received in randomized order either enalaprilat (5 mg i.v.) or nifedipine (10 mg p.o.). Enalaprilat and nifedipine were equally effective in acutely lowering blood pressure. However, good responders to one agent were not necessarily good responders to the other.", 
    "275": "A series of 12 adult patients with stable bronchial asthma and an established diagnosis of essential hypertension (WHO I or II) were studied in a randomized double-blind crossover study to assess the effect of captopril (50-100 mg/day) and verapamil (160-240 mg/day) on blood pressure, lung function, and asthmatic symptoms. The effect of the medication on blood pressure was significant. Blood pressure (mean 164/103 mm Hg initially) decreased to a mean of 145/90 mm Hg and 155/92 mm Hg after 4 weeks on captopril and verapamil, respectively, with fewer orthostatic changes caused by captopril. There were no marked changes of asthmatic symptoms or peak flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume (FEV1) measurements during the trial.", 
    "276": "Our study on intracellular effects of angiotensin II in human platelets showed that: (1) angiotensin II increases intracellular free calcium in platelets via a receptor-operated mechanism and this increase is dose-dependent; (2) the effect on platelet intracellular free calcium depends on the extracellular calcium concentration; (3) ACE inhibition leads to an increased sensitivity of intracellular free calcium to angiotensin II but does not alter epinephrine-induced calcium increase; (4) nifedipine reduces the susceptibility of platelet intracellular free calcium for angiotensin II.", 
    "277": "The effects of two antihypertensive agents, nifedipine (N) and captopril (C), on left ventricular (LV) mass and volume were studied in 16 patients with essential hypertension (8 treated with N and 8 with C for 6 months) by means of a complete M-mode echocardiogram monitored by two-dimensional echocardiography. Both N and C induced a significant reduction in end-diastolic, but not systolic, posterior wall and septum thickness and an increase in end-diastolic volume, but not in end-systolic volume. A significant increase in the contribution of rapid filling together with a simultaneous reduction in the contribution of atrial systole to end diastolic volume were also observed. The reduction in LV wall thickness and mass after both C and N might be attributed to an improvement in diastolic function and to a reduction in wall tension, rather than to an effective regression of LV hypertrophy.", 
    "278": "Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to subtotal (1 7/8) nephrectomy or streptozotocin diabetes were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a calcium channel blocker and their course compared with untreated control animals. Subtotal nephrectomy led to hypertension, proteinuria, reduced creatinine clearance, and glomerulosclerosis over 6 weeks. Enalapril treatment (5 mg/kg/day, n = 11) or felodipine (30 mg/kg/day, n = 11) reduced systolic blood pressure to a comparable degree. Plasma creatinine (mumol/l) was lower after enalapril treatment (110 +/- 8, p less than 0.05) than with felodipine treatment (153 +/- 27) or no treatment (173 +/- 19, n = 18). Proteinuria (mg/24 h) was lower with enalapril treatment (15 +/- 3, p less than 0.001) than with no treatment (85 +/- 22) and increased with felodipine (221 +/- 35). Glomerulosclerosis was reduced with enalapril but not felodipine treatment. Diabetic rats were treated with enalapril (5 mg/kg/day, n = 17), verapamil (5 mg/kg/day, n = 17), or untreated. Diabetic rats had increased creatinine clearance (ml/min) compared with nondiabetic controls (1.52 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.05, n = 11, p less than 0.01). Enalapril and verapamil treatment reduced blood pressure equally. Enalapril but not verapamil reduced the elevated creatinine clearance of diabetic rats (enalapril, 1.37 +/- 0.04 ml/min, p less than 0.01; verapamil, 1.49 +/- 0.5 ml/min). Proteinuria (mg/24 h) was lower (p less than 0.05) with enalapril treatment (36 +/- 3) but not with verapamil treatment (58 +/- 10) in comparison to that in untreated diabetes (71 +/- 18).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "279": "In comparison with a nonspecific vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), we intended to deduce the characteristics of nifedipine (NIF) and captopril (CAP) in the treatment of hypertension. Ten patients with essential hypertension were hospitalized and kept on a constant sodium diet (10 g NaCl/day). Renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured before and after the respective administration of SNP (0.9 +/- 0.5 mcg/kg/min), NIF (17 +/- 5 mg), and CAP (85 +/- 24 mg). SNP significantly reduced the mean blood pressure (MBP), the renal vascular resistance index (RVRI), urine volume (UV), urinary excretion of sodium (UNaV), and significantly raised active renin concentration (ARC), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and the heart rate (HR). RBF, GFR, and plasma epinephrine (E) were not changed. Compared with SNP, NIF significantly raised RBF, UV, UNaV, and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and significantly reduced RVRI. The differences between the increases in ARC, NE, and HR by NIF and those by SNP were not significant. GFR and E were not changed by NIF. Although CAP did not reduce MBP as much as SNP did, the increase in RBF by CAP was significantly greater than that by SNP. Changes in GFR, UV, UNaV, FENa, and E by CAP were not different than those by SNP. CAP increased ARC and did not raise E, NE, and HR. In conclusion, compared with SNP, NIF significantly raised RBF, UV, UNaV, and FENa and significantly reduced RVRI. On the other hand, the renal response to CAP was not very much different from the response to SNP. The characteristics of CAP were the suppressed sympathetic response to the decrease in blood pressure.", 
    "280": "A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, latin square design study of nifedipine, 20 mg, and lisinopril, 20 mg, alone and in combination was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. Blood pressure, heart rate, lisinopril and nifedipine levels, plasma catecholamines, renin, aldosterone, and angiotensin converting enzyme activity were measured for 96 h after each acute dose. Both drugs lowered blood pressure (p less than 0.001), but the combination showed only additive effects. Heart rate rose over the first 4 h following the combination. Side effects were also additive. There was no effect of nifedipine on plasma ACE, renin, or aldosterone and no effect of either drug on plasma catecholamines. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs were unaltered in combination. Thus, nifedipine and lisinopril have additive dynamic effects with no pharmacokinetic interaction.", 
    "281": "The novel compound BW A575C, N-(1-(S)-carboxy-5-[4-(3-isopropylamino-2-(R,S)-hydroxypropoxy)-indole-2 - carboxamido]pentyl)-(R,S)-alanyl-(S)-proline, is a potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker in vitro. It was therefore of considerable interest to establish whether this novel pharmacological profile was maintained in vivo. In conscious instrumented normotensive rats and dogs, intravenous and oral administration of BW A575C causes a dose-dependent rightward displacement of the pressor dose-response curve to angiotensin I (dose ratio of 29.5 and 16.1 in rats and dogs, respectively, at 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) and the tachycardia dose-response curve to isoprenaline (dose ratio of 3.1 and 8.0 in rats and dogs, respectively, at 1.0 mg/kg i.v.). In these experiments BW A575C is approximately 2-10 times more active as an ACE inhibitor than as a beta-blocker. In conscious instrumented acute renovascular hypertensive dogs, where plasma renin activity is elevated 10-fold, BW A575C (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) causes a reduction in blood pressure of 35% within 10 min of injection, which is sustained for up to 4 h. This reduction in blood pressure is accompanied by a consistent, but nonsignificant, reduction in heart rate. These results confirm the novel pharmacological profile of BW A575C in vivo and demonstrate that this compound is an effective antihypertensive agent in a renin-dependent model of hypertension.", 
    "282": "There are several first choices for mild and moderate hypertension. The selection of a drug may of course be influenced by concomitant pathology, with positive indications for particular drugs: for coexistent angina, a beta-receptor blocking drug or a calcium antagonist; for fluid retention, a diuretic; or for contraindications, e.g., asthma, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. There are therefore several possible first choices: beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, a combined alpha/vasodilator beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, the vasodilators (i.e., drugs acting primarily to reduce peripheral resistance), the calcium antagonists, alpha 1-blocking drugs, and, more recently, the possibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Diuretics are also possible first choice agents, although not quite so frequently as once was the case. The majority of cases of hypertension can usually be controlled by one drug, even if not the first agent chosen. More severe cases may require drugs from two of the three major groups: beta-blocking drugs, vasodilators, and diuretics are often required, and, in some cases, drugs from each group. Drugs such as methyldopa, clonidine, and the adrenergic neuron inhibitory drugs are now more used as reserve agents.", 
    "283": "The kidney and plasma of many species contain both an active form of renin and an inactive, but activatable, form. The kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin suppressed acid-activation of rabbit plasma inactive renin but not activation of the form of inactive renin released by rabbit kidney cortex slices incubated in vitro. This suggests that inactive renin is structurally modified after secretion. An aprotinin-sensitive step appears to regulate inactive renin secretion. Aprotinin inhibited inactive, but not active, renin secretion by rabbit kidney cortex slices and selectively suppressed the elevated release of inactive renin produced in sheep by the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. In anaesthetised rats, aprotinin potentiated the increase in plasma renin produced by captopril.", 
    "284": "The mechanisms by which captopril inhibits vasopressin-stimulated osmotic water flow in the toad bladder have been investigated in vitro. Captopril has two possible mechanisms for the inhibitory action on the water flow, one is its stimulative effect on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis by inhibition of kininase II activity, the other, is a direct effect on water flow independent of PGE2. Captopril inhibited the vasopressin-, cyclic adenosine monophosphate- and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine-stimulated water flow. The inhibition of water flow by bradykinin was enhanced by captopril. These data indicate that captopril increased the amount of bradykinin in toad bladder cells resulting in the production of PGE2 which inhibited the increase in water flow induced by vasopressin. The inhibitory effect of captopril, however, also occurred in the presence of indomethacin, when the production of PGE2 was attenuated. Thus, it was concluded that captopril inhibits the vasopressin-stimulated water flow indirectly by inhibiting the degradation of bradykinin and thereby enhancing the production of PGE2, and directly at a site following the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate by vasopressin.", 
    "285": "The safety and tolerability of lisinopril were assessed in 1,476 patients [1,165 hypertensives and 311 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF)] and 211 normal volunteers. The duration of lisinopril therapy ranged from 1 day to 16 months, with a mean duration of 105 days. In the hypertensive population, the most frequent clinical adverse experiences on lisinopril alone were headache, dizziness, cough, and diarrhea. Not all of these adverse experiences were thought to be drug related. Five percent of patients were discontinued because of adverse clinical experiences; cough and dizziness were the most common reasons for discontinuation. Two of 1,165 (0.17%) hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril died, compared to 0.41% of hypertensive patients on other therapies. Neither case was considered to be drug related. In patients with CHF, the most frequent clinical adverse experiences were dizziness, diarrhea, hypotension, fatigue, headache, and rash. Not all of these adverse experiences were thought to be drug related. The percent of CHF patients discontinuing because of an adverse clinical experience was 7.4%; the most frequent causes for discontinuation were hypotension, dizziness, or renal impairment. Twelve deaths occurred in 311 CHF patients treated with lisinopril (3.9%) compared to 4/104 (3.8%) of CHF patients treated with placebo and 2/65 (3.1%) treated with captopril. Hypotension, orthostatic effects, or dizziness following the initial lisinopril dose occurred infrequently in patients treated with lisinopril. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, including those treated previously or concomitantly with diuretic therapy, a first-dose hypotensive episode was reported in six of 955, or 0.6%.

After a 2-week run-in period, 130 patients receiving digoxin and/or diuretics were randomised to 12 weeks of treatment with lisinopril 5 mg daily (87 patients) or with placebo (43 patients), with an option to increase lisinopril dosage to 10 or 20 mg. Patients treated with lisinopril improved significantly more than placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.05) for all clinical parameters except oedema and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Left ventricular ejection fraction rose by 8% in lisinopril patients compared to 2% in the placebo group, while the cardiothoracic ratio and echocardiographic end systolic diameter fell in the lisinopril group (p less than 0.01) but not in the placebo group. Exercise duration was greater in the lisinopril group at all timepoints, and the increase in exercise duration at 12 weeks was greater by more than 2 min in the lisinopril group as compared to the placebo group (p less than 0.01). Changes in clinical and noninvasive parameters such as the New York Heart Association status, were well correlated with changes in exercise duration. Four patients in the lisinopril group and three in the placebo group died in this study, and there were 31 adverse clinical experiences in the 87 lisinopril-treated patients compared to 13 in the 43 placebo-treated patients. We conclude that lisinopril in doses of 2.5-20 mg/day is well tolerated and effective in patients with heart failure who are receiving digitalis and diuretics.", 
    "287": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril is accepted therapy for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure. In this trial, we compared the new ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, to captopril during a 12-week randomized double-blind study. One hundred twenty-nine patients with New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV congestive heart failure were randomized to receive either lisinopril 5 mg/day (n = 64) or captopril 37.5 mg/day (n = 65) in 15 centers. Drug doses could be titrated upwards every 4 weeks. The primary measure of drug efficacy was improvement in treadmill exercise time using a modified Naughton protocol. Secondary measures of efficacy and the development of adverse effects were also examined. Lisinopril improved exercise time (following 12 weeks of therapy) more than captopril [from 500 +/- 30 to 682 +/- 34 sec (mean +/- SEM) with lisinopril versus 480 +/- 26 to 600 +/- 35 sec with captopril; difference between groups, p less than 0.05]. Adverse drug effects were unusual and similar in frequency in the two groups, although an increase in blood urea nitrogen was more common with lisinopril than with captopril (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that using the doses and treatment regimens studied, lisinopril is more effective than captopril for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure. Adverse experiences with lisinopril were infrequent and similar in incidence to those observed with captopril.", 
    "288": "The acute hemodynamic, hormonal, and pharmacokinetic aspects of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril were assessed in two studies in 24 patients with chronic stable congestive heart failure (CHF). Lisinopril, the lysine analogue of enalaprilat, is biologically active following absorption and is cleared via the urine without any known metabolic transformation. In the hemodynamic study, single doses of lisinopril (1.25-10.0 mg) were administered on days 1 and 3, each followed by 48 h of intensive hemodynamic observation in 12 patients. Arterial and mixed venous blood from the right atrium were sampled frequently and assayed for angiotensin I, angiotensin II, ACE activity, plasma renin activity, renin substrate, plasma aldosterone, and serum drug concentration. Across all doses, reductions in mean arterial pressure (-17.2%), mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-28.0%), and systemic vascular resistance (-25.6%) were observed compared to baseline values. No significant changes in heart rate or cardiac index were observed. The analysis of the hormonal parameters indicate potent inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system for a period exceeding 24 h. In the pharmacokinetic study, 12 hospitalized patients with chronic CHF received lisinopril both orally and intravenously, with each dose followed by a 72-h arterial blood and urine sampling schedule. Arterial blood pressure was monitored continuously for 6 h following each dosage using an intraarterial cannula. Mean urinary recovery of lisinopril was found to be 15% following oral administration and 88% following intravenous administration. Maximal serum drug concentration occurred at 6 h after oral drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "289": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of lisinopril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were assessed in 40 elderly patients (aged 65 years or over) with mild to moderate systolic/diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension, in an open study of 12 weeks' duration. Lisinopril was given orally in single daily doses. The starting dose was 5 mg in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30-60 ml/min and 10 mg in patients with GFR greater than 60 ml/min. The dose of lisinopril could be titrated upwards to a maximum of 40 mg daily according to blood pressure response. A thiazide diuretic was then added if blood pressure was not controlled. Thirty-six patients completed the study. Mean sitting blood pressure was significantly reduced by lisinopril treatment. There was no significant alteration in the heart rate, and postural hypotension did not occur. The median dose of lisinopril given was 20 mg daily (range 5-40 mg daily), and only two patients had a diuretic added to the lisinopril. One patient was withdrawn from the study because of unstable angina, and another was discontinued from lisinopril treatment because of anorexia and facial flushing. One patient was withdrawn after 8 weeks because of interruption of lisinopril therapy for a transurethral resection of the prostate, and one patient was lost to follow-up. No clinically significant haematological or biochemical changes were observed. The mean glomerular filtration rate was unchanged during the study. Proteinuria did not occur de novo, nor did established proteinuria increase. Thus lisinopril was well-tolerated and effective therapy in a group of elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "290": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of lisinopril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were assessed in 23 patients with hypertension associated with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate 60 ml/min or less) in an open study of 12 weeks' duration. Lisinopril was given orally in single daily doses. The starting dose was 2.5 mg in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 ml/min and 5 mg in all other patients. This was titrated to a maximum of 40 mg daily according to blood pressure response. A diuretic was then added if blood pressure was not controlled. Mean sitting and standing blood pressures were significantly reduced by lisinopril treatment. The median dose of lisinopril taken was 10 mg daily (range 2.5-40 mg), and only three patients required the addition of a diuretic. The mean glomerular filtration rate was unchanged during the study (38 +/- 16.4 ml/min at baseline, 41 +/- 21.0 ml/min after 12 weeks of treatment). Twenty-two patients completed the study. One patient was withdrawn because of nausea and vomiting due to reflux oesophagitis which was probably not drug related. Another patient had transient mild angioneurotic oedema and continued on lisinopril. No clinically significant haematological or biochemical changes were observed. In conclusion, lisinopril provided effective blood pressure control and was well tolerated in this group of hypertensives who are typically difficult to treat.", 
    "291": "Eleven patients (five women and six men), aged 24-60 years, were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, with a once-daily dose as the only antihypertensive treatment. Renal artery stenosis was unilateral in eight patients and bilateral in the remaining three. Fibromuscular dysplasia was present in seven patients, and renal arteriosclerotic narrowing was present in the remaining four. All completed a 6-month treatment and went on to a long-term treatment program for a final 24 months, now completed by five patients. Mean pretreatment blood pressure, 187 +/- 19/112 +/- 5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic; mean +/- SD), was reduced to 148/87 following the drug titration period (1 week), and the same antihypertensive control was maintained throughout the study. Plasma concentration of angiotensin II, aldosterone, and serum ACE activity were effectively reduced for at least 24 h following drug administration. Serum concentrations of lisinopril varied individually and rose in two patients with moderate renal failure. Renal function was well maintained, and control renography revealed no worsening of renal artery stenosis or renal function. The drug was well tolerated without side effects other than cough in one patient. We conclude that lisinopril monotherapy is highly effective in renovascular hypertension. Drug safety was demonstrated by the lack of serious side effects.", 
    "292": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, by preventing the generation of angiotensin II, has some pronounced effects on renal function. Its actions occur at the vascular, the glomerular, the juxtaglomerular, and also at the tubular medullary level. In clinical medicine, depending on the circumstances of the patients under treatment, converting enzyme inhibitors can interfere with renal hemodynamics and glomerular filtration, with solute excretion by the kidney and other variables of normal renal function. In most circumstances, the effects of converting enzyme inhibition on the kidney are rather beneficial to the patient. However, under some extreme conditions, they may become potentially hazardous. A basic understanding of the physiology of the renin-angiotensin system and of its actions on the kidney makes it possible to understand the impact of the converting enzyme inhibitors, to avoid most of the unwanted effects and to ensure greatest benefit to the patient.", 
    "293": "A double-blind controlled, randomized, parallel, multicenter 12-week study was conducted to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of lisinopril with that of metoprolol in treatment of moderate to severe hypertension. Initially, 118 patients were recruited on lisinopril and 61 on metoprolol; and for the purpose of efficacy analysis at week 8, 115 patients on lisinopril and 60 on metoprolol were included. The doses of lisinopril or metoprolol were 40-80 mg/day and 100-200 mg/day, respectively. At week 4, the pretreatment diastolic blood pressure of 111 mm Hg was decreased to 97 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) with lisinopril: metoprolol decreased the diastolic blood pressure from 110 to 99 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Similar decreases were noted at week 8; however, the drop in blood pressure with lisinopril was not significantly different from that with metoprolol. Systolic blood pressure also demonstrated a decrease of about 18 mm Hg with lisinopril and 12 mm Hg with metoprolol (p less than 0.01). This larger decrease in systolic blood pressure with lisinopril was statistically significant at week 4 (p less than 0.05). These decreases in systolic blood pressures were maintained at week 8, again with statistical significance (p less than 0.01). Of the 118 lisinopril-treated patients, four were discontinued from lisinopril therapy because of headache, dizziness, rash, flushing, or lymphadenopathy. Four patients out of 61 (9.8%) were discontinued from metoprolol therapy because of fatigue, somnolence, asthenia, weight gain, flatulence, tremor, or bronchospasm. In conclusion, lisinopril 40-80 mg once daily is as effective as metoprolol 100-200 mg once daily in reducing diastolic blood pressure in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "294": "A total of 136 patients with mild to severe uncomplicated essential hypertension were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-placebo, parallel study to compare the effect of lisinopril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, with that of nifedipine. Following a 2-week placebo control period the patients were treated with either 20-80 mg/day of lisinopril (n = 89) or with 40-80 mg/day of nifedipine (n = 47). Blood pressure was significantly reduced in both groups after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. There was no difference in the effect of lisinopril compared to nifedipine. No serious clinical or laboratory adverse experiences were observed during the study. The incidence of clinical side effects was significantly lower in the lisinopril group than in the nifedipine group (21.3 vs. 48.9%, p less than or equal to 0.01). There were no significant changes in laboratory data in either group. The results indicate that lisinopril is as effective as nifedipine in the treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension and that lisinopril is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile.", 
    "295": "In a multicenter, parallel, double-blind study, lisinopril was compared with atenolol in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to a once-a-day treatment with lisinopril 20 mg or atenolol 50 mg for 4 weeks, and the doses of lisinopril or atenolol were increased up to 80 mg or 200 mg, respectively, at 4-week intervals if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was not well controlled. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 or 25 mg was added after 12 weeks, if necessary, and titrated upward after 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 25 or 50 mg/day. Lisinopril and atenolol reduced SDBP to a similar extent. All reductions from baseline in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significant (less than 0.01). Lisinopril produced a significant (less than 0.01) greater reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) than atenolol. Addition of HCTZ caused further blood pressure reductions (p less than 0.01). Five patients (1.7%) on lisinopril and four (2.0%) on atenolol developed skin rashes during weeks 1-12. Two patients (0.7%) on lisinopril 80 mg developed proteinuria (greater than 1 g/day). Cough occurred more often with lisinopril (4.5%), and elevated triglycerides occurred more often with atenolol (2.0%).", 
    "296": "Lisinopril (LIS) is a lysine analog of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Unlike enalapril, the precursor of enalaprilat, LIS is not a prodrug but has equal ACEI efficacy and potency and a slightly longer duration of action after oral administration. Short-term (12 weeks) and long-term (24 weeks) blood pressure control has been studied with LIS, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and LIS + HCTZ when given once a day. Drug treatment had three phases: (i) 2-4 weeks of single-blind placebo washout; (ii) 12 weeks of double-blind comparison therapy with LIS 20, 40, and 80 mg vs. HCTZ 12.5, 25, and 50 mg, vs. LIS + HCTZ 20 + 12.5, 40 + 25, and 80 + 50 mg; (iii) 13-24 weeks single-blind LIS vs. LIS + HCTZ. Starting double-blind therapy at the lowest dose, all three groups doubled the dose at weeks 4 and 8 if BP was not controlled with sitting diastolic BP (SDBP) less than 90 mm Hg. At the end of 12 weeks of double-blind therapy, uncontrolled HCTZ-only and LIS-only treatment groups were advanced to combination LIS + HCTZ therapy but uncontrolled LIS + HCTZ patients were dropped. Mean BP reductions (systolic/diastolic, mm Hg) for all three groups after 12 weeks of double-blind comparison therapy were: (i) LIS (n = 162), -16.6/-12.5; (ii) HCTZ (n = 155), -10.4/-6.8; (iii) LIS + HCTZ (n = 74), -23.9/-18.2 with p less than 0.01 for all groups compared to baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "297": "Lisinopril is an orally active, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is not metabolized or bound to protein. Peak serum concentrations occur 6-8 h after oral dosing. Lisinopril bioavailability (approximately 25%) is not significantly affected by food, age, or coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), propranolol, digoxin, and glibenclamide. Lisinopril is excreted unchanged in the urine. Steady state is achieved in 2-3 days with little accumulation. Significant accumulation occurs in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 ml/min). Lisinopril inhibits ACE activity, thereby reducing plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone and increasing plasma renin activity. Lisinopril produces a smooth, gradual blood pressure (BP) reduction in hypertensive patients without affecting heart rate or cardiovascular reflexes. The antihypertensive effect begins within 2 h, peaks around 6 h, and lasts for at least 24 h. Lisinopril produces greater systolic and diastolic BP reductions than HCTZ. Lisinopril is similar to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic BP, but superior in systolic BP reduction. Lisinopril and nifedipine produce comparable reductions in systolic and diastolic BP. When lisinopril is given once daily as monotherapy, the range of BP reductions is 11-15% in systolic and 13-17% in diastolic. HCTZ addition enhances its antihypertensive effect. Lisinopril does not produce hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, or hypercholesterolemia. Lisinopril has natriuretic properties; renal blood flow remains stable or increases. Lisinopril increases cardiac output, and decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean arterial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. Human experience to date (2,800 patients/subjects) indicates that lisinopril is well tolerated and has a good safety profile.", 
    "298": "The effects of antihypertensive drugs on the quality of life are complex. Drugs may affect the enjoyment of life through central actions but also through a psychological response to pharmacological actions elsewhere in the body. In addition, the patient's expectation of the consequences of disease and its treatment may significantly influence the quality of his or her life. The effect of prior expectations by both the patient and the doctor, the different methods for assessing the quality of life effects, and the high level of individual variability make any assessment of the absolute importance of quality of life adverse effects extremely difficult. However, comparison of ACE inhibitors with more long-standing forms of antihypertensive therapy suggests a rather more favourable impact of ACE inhibition on the quality of life.", 
    "299": "At the Cambridge Conference, the pros and cons of various classes of antihypertensive drugs were extensively discussed, including the place of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in today's spectrum. A consensus was easily reached that the most important advantage of having the present broad armamentarium of antihypertensive drugs is that a wide choice is now available from which to find the most suitable agent for the individual patient. A revised stepped-care design was proposed, in which the doctor has the choice of starting antihypertensive therapy with a thiazide diuretic, a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or a calcium antagonist. Small doses of any agent should be used to start with, and doses should not subsequently be increased beyond that at which side effects appear. Should such symptoms occur, the doctor has the choice of either switching to another first-step compound or reducing the dose of the first agent and combining it with one of other available drugs.", 
    "300": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are of proven benefit in patients with severe grades of heart failure who are already on baseline treatment with diuretics. Under these circumstances they have been shown, in controlled prospective studies, to be superior to placebo and also to other vasodilators. Many areas of uncertainty remain, however, and some of these were addressed at the Cambridge Conference. This brief overview summarizes the views expressed by delegates. It was recognized that heart failure is a heterogeneous disorder in relation to etiology, severity, outlook, and associated clinical and biochemical abnormalities. Each patient, therefore, must be treated on an individual basis, and general rules will need to be modified according to the particular requirements of the individual. No formal attempt was made to assess preferences for individual ACE inhibitors in heart failure, and indeed this would have been impractical because many clinicians were familiar with only one agent.", 
    "301": "Most commonly used drugs reduce blood pressure equally. Reduction in pressure lessens the chance of stroke but appears to have little impact on death from ischaemic heart disease in the majority. Loss of arterial compliance, development of cardiac hypertrophy, impaired coronary blood flow, and dysrhythmias may contribute, at least in part, to the adverse cardiac effects of hypertension. It is speculated that converting enzyme inhibitors could offer beneficial effects in these areas.", 
    "302": "The possibility of a coexistence of coronary arteriolar constriction mediated by the renin-angiotensin system and myocardial ischemia was evaluated. Left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and perfused at normal (mean aortic), intermediate (50 mm Hg), and low (30-40 mm Hg) pressure in analogy to a progressive coronary stenosis. Lactate production was present at low coronary pressure indicating myocardial ischemia. In control animals (n = 18), mean coronary conductance was higher (p less than 0.005) at intermediate than at high coronary pressure consistent with autoregulation at coronary flow. Coronary conductance was lower (p less than 0.05) at low than at intermediate coronary pressure, indicating coronary constriction during myocardial ischemia. Adenosine (20 micrograms/kg per min i.c., n = 6) resulted in higher coronary conductance, suggesting coronary vasodilator reserve even at low coronary pressure. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v., n = 12) resulted in low coronary conductance; however, the increase at intermediate (autoregulation) and the decrease (constriction) at low pressure was maintained. Plasma renin activity increased, and saralasin (0.1 microgram/kg per min i.c.) and captopril (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) acted as coronary vasodilators in various models of myocardial ischemia. Captopril limited myocardial infarct size at 6 hours of coronary occlusion, diminished flow repayment and prevented lactate production after 30 s of coronary occlusion, and abolished the deterioration of myocardial function during myocardial ischemia induced by coronary hypoperfusion and atrial pacing. Thus, myocardial ischemia does not generally represent a state of maximal coronary dilatation. The renin-angiotensin system is activated by myocardial ischemia and may exert a coronary constrictive tone. Captopril was beneficial in experimental myocardial ischemia.", 
    "303": "The effects on cardiac function of captopril (CPT) and digoxin (D) were compared in a study of 16 patients with chronic heart failure due to ischemic heart disease (15) and to congestive cardiomyopathy (1) (New York Heart Association class II n.13 and class III n.3). All patients were normotensive and in sinus rhythm. CPT 25 mg every 8 hours (t.i.d.) or D 0.25 mg once daily was given in a single-blind crossover design: A placebo (PLC) t.i.d. was given for 5 to 10 days, then CPT or D, according to a random sequence, replaced three or one of the PLC tablets; after one month, CPT and D were switched to PLC for 5 to 10 days; subsequently, the PLC tablets were replaced by CPT in the patients who previously received D and vice versa, and both treatments were again continued for one month. PLC, CPT, and D tablets were all identical. Diuretics once daily were given throughout the study. Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (ALDO), plasma noradrenaline (NA), and adrenaline (A) were determined at the end of the two PLC periods and the two active treatments. A hand grip and a bicycle exercise were performed at the end of the two PLC periods and the two active treatments. No difference was noted between the PLC periods. PRA increased with CPT and did not change with D. ALDO was decreased by both CPT and D. NA and A were similarly decreased by both drugs, both supine and standing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "304": "Twenty-three patients with severe heart failure (NYHA classes III and IV) on treatment with digitalis and diuretics were additionally treated in a randomized double-blind study over a 6-month period with captopril (n = 12; mean daily dose 84 mg) or a placebo (n = 11) and were then reexamined. In the captopril group, the left-ventricular filling pressure decreased by 9 mm Hg (from 23 to 14) at rest and 6 mm Hg (from 35 to 29) during exercise. In the placebo group, there was an increase of 4 mm Hg (from 25 to 29) at rest and 7 mm Hg (from 33 to 40) during exercise; p less than 0.01 (p less than 0.01). In the captopril group, the cardiac index at rest increased 0.7 1/min/m2 (from 2.1 to 2.8) and during exercise 1.2 1/min/m2 (from 2.8 to 4.0). In the placebo group, the increase in cardiac index was considerably less pronounced at rest (= 0.2 1/min/m2; from 1.9 to 2.1) and during exercise (= 0.1 1/min/m2; from 2.7 to 2.8); p less than 0.02 (p less than 0.01). The improved cardiac output had a beneficial effect on the renal blood flow. Hippuran clearance increased by 46 ml/min (from 271 to 318), whereas in the control group it decreased 25 ml/min (from 259 to 234) (p less than 1.02). Both the heart rate and the arterial blood pressure remained constant, whereas the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance was definitely more pronounced in the captopril group (= 562 dyne X s X cm-5, from 1,841 to 1,279) than in the placebo group (= 123 dyne X s X cm-5, from 1,834 to 1,710; p less than 0.02). The heart volume, assessed radiographically, increased slightly in the placebo group, and the left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter remained constant in both groups. In the course of the study, two patients died in the captopril group and three in the placebo group. After six months, eight patients in the captopril group and three in the placebo group had improved by at least one NYHA category. The beneficial effects of captopril are due to its inhibitory effect on the renin-angiotensin system as well as to the inhibition of sympathetic stimulation. Consequently, in the captopril group the quantity of plasma norepinephrine decreased by 188 ng/ml (from 430 to 618); p less than 0.03. The indirect vasodilation caused by this mechanism leads to persistent unloading of the myocardium and an improvement in heart failure without loss of action by counterregulatory mechanisms.", 
    "305": "To study the hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of hydralazine versus captopril after the first dose, 15 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA Class II and III) were included in a crossover trial with a washout period of three days. Hemodynamic parameters were measured by using a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter, and venous blood was sampled during supine rest and standardized upright exercise before (control) and 60 min after drug administration. Compared to the control phase, hydralazine induced an increase in heart rate and cardiac index (p less than 0.01), and a decrease in mean arterial pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively). The hemodynamic effects were associated with increased norepinephrine plasma concentration during upright exercise (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma renin activity (p less than 0.01). After administration of captopril, heart rate at rest (p less than 0.05), mean arterial pressure, and pulmonary wedge pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.01). Cardiac index remained unchanged. Norepinephrine plasma concentrations were not significantly influenced despite a tendency to lower levels during upright exercise. Plasma renin activity increased (p less than 0.01) and aldosterone at rest decreased significantly (p less than 0.05). These differences in neurohumoral response between both drugs may be important for their long-term effects.", 
    "306": "We previously reported concentration-dependent protection of captopril against ischemia-reperfusion injury in the isolated rat heart. In order to study these effects in vivo, we developed a closed-chest pig model. Reversible occlusion of the left coronary artery was achieved with a PTCA catheter during one hour. Captopril (C) i.v. was given in two different concentrations (0.6 mg/kg/10 min + 0.3 mg/kg/2 hr and 6 mg/kg/10 min + 3.0 mg/kg/2 hr) during the experiments to 11 and 10 pigs, respectively, versus 12 controls, who received only saline. Due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias, nine pigs died during ischemia. At the end of the reperfusion period of two hours, eight pigs were alive in each group. In the C-treated pigs, maximum creatine kinase after two hours of reperfusion was significantly lowered to 6,337 +/- 709 U/L in the high dose group versus 8,285 +/- 851 U/L in the low dose group and 9,635 +/- 1,115 U/L in the saline group. A reduction of local inosine overflow in the coronary sinus was seen. Maximum noradrenaline overflow after 5 min reperfusion diminished dose-dependently to 695 +/- 284 and 3,129 +/- 1,728 pg/ml in the C treated groups versus 4,693 +/- 2,277 pg/ml in the saline group. Mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output decreased significantly during ischemia and reperfusion, but no significant differences occurred between the treated and untreated groups. Reperfusion arrhythmias, mainly accelerated idioventricular rhythm disturbances, were comparable among the three groups. We conclude that in vivo administration of C reduces myocardial damage upon reperfusion after one hour of ischemia in a dose-dependent way.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "307": "The effect of captopril (80 micrograms/ml) on coronary flow in the isolated rat heart was compared with the effects of a non-sulfhydryl-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (15 micrograms/ml), and of a sulfhydryl-containing compound with no converting enzyme-inhibiting properties, glutathione (112 micrograms/ml). Drug concentrations were equipotent in their effect on angiotensin I pressor response and equimolar with respect to the sulfhydryl group. Cyclooxygenase products or their stable metabolites (TXB2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2) were measured in the coronary effluent. Furthermore, the effect of mepacrin (1 microM), indomethacin (1 microM), and FPL 55712 (10 microM) on the changes in coronary flow induced by captopril was studied. Both captopril- and glutathione-treated hearts showed a significant increase in coronary flow already after 5 min treatment. After 60 min treatment, coronary flow was further increased to 185 +/- 9% for captopril-treated hearts and to 210 +/- 11% for glutathione-treated hearts when compared to saline treatment. Ramipril treatment resulted in a slower increase in coronary flow, which was significant after 20 min treatment. After 60 min treatment, this increase was 122 +/- 3% when compared to saline-treated hearts. This effect of ramipril was associated with a significant increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha overflow when compared to saline-treated hearts. Captopril and glutathione had no significant effect on overflow of the measured cyclooxygenase products. The effect of captopril and glutathione on coronary flow appeared to be dose dependent in an equimolar range. Simultaneous mepacrin treatment diminished the effect of captopril on coronary flow; indomethacin had no effect, and FPL 55712 potentiated the effect of captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Plasma angiotensin II was elevated at 16.8 (3.6) pmol/l (mean [SE]) including high levels in three of four patients in the absence of any previous therapy, including diuretics. Repeated low doses of captopril were administered to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less than 14 mm Hg or to a maximum total dose of 25 mg. Right atrial pressure fell from 12.4 (0.9) to 9.4 (0.7) mm Hg p less than 0.001, pulmonary arterial pressure from 32.7 (3) to 26.4 (2.2) p = 0.01, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 25.7 (2.9) to 19.9 (2.2) p = 0.01. Despite a fall in systemic vascular resistance from 1,540 (110) to 1,330 (76) dyn/s/cm5, and mean arterial pressure from 84.8 (3.9) to 76.7 (2.7) p = 0.001, changes in cardiac output were small: 3.8 (0.3) to 4.2 (0.3) NS. Angiotensin II fell in all patients even after only 3.125 mg to a mean of 3.6 (1.0). These improvements occurred whether basal angiotensin II was elevated or normal, and in the presence or absence of diuretic therapy. At 24 hours, seven patients received captopril in the maximum titrated dose of the previous day. Haemodynamic changes at one hour were of similar magnitude to those during incremental dosing. These results suggest that reduction of angiotensin II exerts beneficial haemodynamic effects in heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "309": "Neuroendocrine activation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may have important physiological consequences for myocardial perfusion and function. We measured plasma angiotensin II in 60 patients with AMI within 6 hours of pain and on days 1-3 and day 10. On admission, AII was normal at 9.9 + 1.3 pmol/l (normal range 2-12 pmol/l). At day 3, AII rose markedly to 77.5 + 25.0 in those with heart failure (group 1, n = 13); but AII also rose in uncomplicated patients (group 2, n = 47) to 27.8 + 4.0 (p less than 0.001). At day 10, levels of AII remained high, especially in group 1 (50.5 + 22.2 vs 6.1 + 1.5, p less than 0.005). Thus neuroendocrine activation, present early in AMI, is seen in both uncomplicated infarcts and in those developing heart failure. Angiotensin II mediated vasoconstriction perhaps enhanced by catecholamines could have deleterious effects on myocardial function and perfusion, and indicates the potential for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in early AMI.", 
    "310": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by MK 421 (6 mg/kg/day ip) induced a significant increase in urinary kinin excretion in norepinephrine-infused rats (1.8 mg/kg/day ip), whereas it had no effect on urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion. In contrast, MK 421 did not induced any significant changes in urinary kinin and prostaglandin E2 excretion in vasopressin-infused rats (7.2 U/kg/day ip). The simultaneous administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg/day sc), OKY 046 (12 mg/kg/day sc) or aprotinin (100,000 units/kg/day sc) did not affect the antihypertensive effect of MK 421 in rats made hypertensive by chronic infusion of norepinephrine or vasopressin. The present results suggest that the hypotensive effect of MK 421 may depend on a reduced sensitivity of the vasculature to vasoconstrictor substances. In addition, it is also suggested that neither the prostaglandin-thromboxane or kallikrein-kinin systems are essential for the antihypertensive effect of MK 421 in these models of hypertension.", 
    "311": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II; ACE) has been described as a peptidyldipeptidase or dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.15.1) of the pulmonary endothelial cells, which liberates angiotensin II or inactivates kinins. However, ACE has a much wider distribution and substrate specifity; it is concentrated in human epithelial cells (e.g. brush border of the kidney, placenta, intestine and choroid plexus), neuroepithelial cells (subfornical organ, pallidonigral dendrites, median eminence) and male genital tract (testes, prostate, epididymides, seminal plasma). Its substrates include enkaphalins, the C-terminal extended proenkephalins and a protected chemotactic tripeptide. Recent, mostly in vitro studies with purified ACE, indicate that ACE also cleaves peptides by other than peptidyldipeptidase action. Homogeneous human ACE inactivated substance P in spite of its blocked C-terminus (Met11-NH2) primarily by releasing the C-terminal tripeptide. A blocked C-terminal tripeptide, Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2 was also released from the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH). Although ACE shares many properties with carboxypeptidases, it surprisingly cleaves the N-terminal tripeptide greater than Glu1-His2-Trp3 from LHRH. Because human ACE hydrolyzes a variety of peptide hormones, actions of its inhibitors may go well beyond blocking the conversion of angiotensin I.", 
    "312": "The influence of aprotinin as a kallidinogenase inactivator on the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) was studied in two-kidneyed and one-clipped hypertensive rats. Sixteen two-kidneyed and one-clipped hypertensive rats and sham-operated normotensive rats were prepared for this experiment. They were divided into two groups: those with the aprotinin infusion and those without. The effects of the oral administration of CEI were compared as regards mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urinary kallikrein activity (UKA). In 8 hypertensive rats under glucose infusion, MAP fell from 184.4 +/- 4.5 to 106.3 +/- 5.2 mm Hg, and UKA changed from 1.37 +/- 0.18 nkat/12 h to 0.61 +/- 0.11 nkat/12 h after the administration of CEI. In the remaining hypertensive rats under aprotinin infusion, MAP decreased from 175.0 +/- 3.0 to 140.6 +/- 5.1 mm Hg, and UKA slightly changed from 0.72 +/- 0.25 nkat/12 h to 0.59 +/- 0.12 nkat/12 h. Thus, the decrease of MAP after the administration of CEI was suppressed by the aprotinin infusion, and this significant difference was supported by the decrease of UKA. As for 16 normotensive rats, CEI did not alter MAP, nor did aprotinin have any effect on it. However, UKA tended to decrease after the administration of CEI. These results suggest that both the kallikrein-kinin system and the renin-angiotensin system play an important role in the maintenance of high blood pressure in two-kidneyed and one-clipped chronically hypertensive rats.", 
    "313": "Intracarotid (10 mg/kg), intracerebroventricular (100, 200 micrograms) or topical application (0.8 M) of captopril (a converting enzyme inhibitor) increased the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to Evans blue albumin (EBA) and [131I]sodium in anesthetized normotensive rats. The permeability of the blood-brain barrier to albumen in 6 and to [131I]sodium in 10 out of 14 regions of the brain was increased in the perfused hemisphere after infusion of captopril into the right carotid artery. These regions of the brain were associated with a 54-107% increase in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). Pretreatment with indomethacin and aprotinin prevented both the increased regional permeability of the blood-brain barrier along with regional cerebral blood flow. Pretreatment with vinblastine prevented only the regional increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier. The regional cerebral blood flow continued to remain high. The probable mechanism(s) underlying the increased cerebral blood flow and permeability of the blood-brain barrier after infusion of captopril is discussed.", 
    "314": "The effects of three doses (4, 8, and 16 mg) of perindopril, a new angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, on systemic blood pressure, heart rate, brachial and carotid artery flow and diameter (assessed by the pulsed Doppler technique), forearm vascular resistance, plasma converting enzyme and renin activities, and plasma aldosterone were investigated in the normal volunteer and compared with those of a placebo over a 24-h period following oral drug intake in a double-blind, crossover trial. Perindopril dose-dependently decreased plasma converting enzyme activity, an effect that peaked at 3-4 h and persisted up to at least 48 h. Plasma renin activity increased for 12 h and plasma aldosterone was slightly decreased. Systemic blood pressure and heart rate were not drug-affected but perindopril dose-dependently augmented brachial and carotid artery flow, indicating an increase in peripheral arterial compliance. These vasodilating effects, which lasted up to 10 h after drug intake, affected both large arteries and arterioles, the latter being more sensitive, however, and were more marked in the muscular resistance vessels.", 
    "315": "Cilazapril 1.25 and 5.0 mg p.o. q.d. was administered in double-blind fashion to two groups of six normal volunteers on 8 consecutive days. Blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma converting enzyme activity were measured each day prior to drug administration and up to 72 h after the last dose. Plasma renin activity, blood angiotensin I, plasma angiotensin II, and aldosterone as well as plasma cilazaprilat levels were determined on the first and the last day of active treatment at times 0, 4, and 24 h. The drug was very well tolerated by all volunteers. At 4 h postdrug, plasma converting enzyme activity was reduced in dose-dependent fashion on the first and the eighth day; plasma cilazaprilat levels were also clearly dose dependent. Nevertheless, 24 h postdrug cilazaprilat levels were similar on the first and last day of drug administration, and plasma converting enzyme activity was also stable throughout the 8 days. The various components of the renin-angiotensin system responded in the usual fashion. These results provide strong evidence that cilazapril is a very potent and highly effective converting enzyme inhibitor. Doses well below 5 mg/day will probably suffice for therapeutic efficacy. These data also confirm the hypothesis formulated in the preceding article, i.e., that there is no accumulation of the drug with repeated administration despite its long pharmacological half-life (t1/2).", 
    "316": "The pharmacokinetics of the new converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril were investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers. Single oral doses of 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg of cilazapril were tested in groups of six subjects, each of whom received two different doses. A 2-week interval was allowed between treatments. Plasma levels of cilazaprilat, the active form of cilazapril, were measured for up to 3 days after drug administration. Peak plasma levels and 24-h areas under the curve (AUCs) were almost directly proportional to dose, and the elimination half-life (t1/2) during the first 8 h after dosing was 1.5 h. From 24 h on, there was a prolonged terminal phase with a t1/2 of approximately 50 h, and there was only slight dose-dependency during this phase. These data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of cilazapril are nonlinear. A physiologically realistic model based on saturable binding to converting enzyme was developed to account both for the drug kinetics and for the relationship of the kinetics to the dynamics of plasma converting enzyme inhibition. A number of conclusions relevant to the therapeutic application of cilazapril in hypertension are drawn from the data and from the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model.", 
    "317": "The new converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, or RO 31-2848, was evaluated in 14 healthy male volunteers. In a pilot study in two subjects, the inhibiting capacity of single oral doses of 5 and 10 mg on the pressure and heart rate response to exogenous angiotensin I was assessed. Both doses reduced the blood pressure response to angiotensin I to 10% of control within 45 min and for the 4 h tested. In the main study, 12 volunteers each received two single oral doses of cilazapril at a 2-week interval, and plasma converting enzyme and renin activity, blood angiotensin I, plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured serially. Single doses of 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg of cilazapril were tested in groups of six subjects each. All doses inhibited plasma converting enzyme activity by 90% for at least 8 h and induced the expected pattern of changes of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Only slight dose-dependent variations in the effect were observed. Basic heart rate and blood pressure were not altered by any of the doses, which all were well tolerated. These data suggest that cilazapril is a very potent and long-acting new converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "318": "To determine whether calcium fluxes and angiotensin II influence osmoregulation of vasopressin (AVP) secretion, the effects of the calcium antagonist nifedipine and of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on the AVP response to an osmotic load were compared to those of a placebo in seven normal female subjects. Plasma and urinary AVP were measured before and during a 3-h infusion of 2.5% hypertonic saline. Nifedipine (10 mg orally 2 h before and 10 mg at the start of the infusion) increased heart rate but did not change blood pressure. The changes in free water clearance and in urinary AVP induced by hypertonic saline under nifedipine were greater than in the control test, but the slope and the intercept of the regression line of plasma AVP upon plasma osmolality were not significantly different. Enalapril (10 mg 3 h before the infusion) did not change heart rate or blood pressure. Free water clearance and urinary AVP did not differ from the control test, but the slope of the regression line was less steep. These slight modifications of the response to an osmotic load suggest that calcium fluxes and angiotensin II only exert a limited influence on AVP osmoregulation in normal females.", 
    "319": "In the summer of 1986, the Gallup Organization conducted two surveys, one of the physicians who treat hypertension and the other of patients who were receiving medications for hypertension. Objectives were to assess current patterns of treatment and the impact of cost on treatment for hypertension. Seventy percent of the patients report being prescribed medication immediately following the diagnosis of hypertension. Diuretics are the most frequently prescribed initial medication (76 percent of physicians), followed by beta blockers (44 percent of physicians). Physicians report recent trends, however, towards more use of beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and less use of diuretics. Only 59 percent of patients have insurance that covers medication, and about one in four patients report that paying for medications or physicians' fees is \"very much\" or \"somewhat\" of a problem. The costs of care are of concern to physicians as well as to patients.", 
    "320": "alpha-MSH acutely enhanced the plasma concentration of aldosterone (but not that of corticosterone) in the rat, with a maximal response at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg. This dose of alpha-MSH increased the blood level o aldosterone and the activity of 11 beta-hydroxylase and 18-hydroxylase of capsular adrenals in rats infused for 24 h with dexamethasone, dexamethasone plus ACTH, or captopril plus angiotensin II, but not in animals treated with captopril alone. The plasma concentration of corticosterone and the activity of 11 beta-hydroxylase in the inner adrenal layers were not changed. These findings indicate that alpha-MSH is specifically involved in the acute stimulation of the late steps of the secretory activity of the rat zona glomerulosa, and that this action of alpha-MSH requires a normal level of circulating angiotensin II.", 
    "321": "Arterial hypertension shows, in the elderly, particular features and special problems connected with its pharmacological treatment. In our work ten patients, aged between 65-75, suffering from essential hypertension, were examined for eight weeks. At the end of this period, we observed a significant reduction of systolic and diastolic pressure, heart rate being unchanged. We didn't observe any significant change in the metabolic parameters considered (uricemia, creatininemia, triglycerides and cholesterol). No patient had to interrupt the treatment as a consequence of side effects. According to our data, we can affirm that Captopril reduces arterial pressure gradually and doesn't cause orthostatic hypotension, being thus very useful in the elderly.", 
    "322": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, EC 3.4.15.1) from monkey brain was partially purified 274-fold with 4.5% yield. The optimum pH of the enzyme was 8.2, and its Km was 3.3 mM, with hippuryl-His-Leu as the substrate in 300 mM NaCl. Its molecular weight (Mr) was estimated to be approximately 260,000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. On high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis, ACE hydrolyzed neo-kyotorphin Thr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Arg) with liberation of kyotorphin (Tyr-Arg), the [Met]enkephalin releaser. ACE also converted [Met]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 to [Met]enkephalin; then the enzyme slowly hydrolyzed the resulting [Met]enkephalin. The Km values of the enzyme for neo-kyotorphin and [Met]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 were 0.58 and 0.30 mM respectively. Thus, brain ACE may have a role in the formation of kyotorphin and [Met]enkephalin from their precursors but has little part in [Met]enkephalin degrading processes.", 
    "323": "Calcium antagonist monotherapy is more effective in older patients and in those with low plasma renin activity, whereas beta blockers control blood pressure better in younger patients and in those with normal or high renin activity. Monotherapy with a calcium antagonist has been shown to result in the reduction of diastolic blood pressure to equal to or less than 95 mm Hg in more than 80 percent of patients with essential hypertension. We investigated the antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil plus an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and nifedipine plus a beta blocker in 24 patients (aged 41 to 68) with moderate to severe hypertension in whom monotherapy with a calcium antagonist had been ineffective. Blood pressure recorded in patients during the placebo period was 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). Twelve patients received monotherapy with nifedipine (50.0 +/- 5.2 mg per day) and 12 others received verapamil (460 +/- 20 mg per day); neither treatment resulted in the reduction of diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg. However, this goal was achieved when atenolol (89.5 +/- 25.7 mg per day) was added to the regimen of patients receiving nifedipine and enalapril (29.5 +/- 5.0 mg per day) was added to the regimen of those receiving verapamil; resultant blood pressures were 127 +/- 3/83 +/- 2 mm Hg and 137 +/- 5/85 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. It is suggested that in patients in whom hypertension is inadequately controlled by calcium antagonist monotherapy, counter-regulatory mechanisms can be blocked by the addition of a beta blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to the calcium antagonist regimen, resulting in greatly improved, simple, well-tolerated, and safe control of blood pressure.", 
    "324": "Because we so rarely know the cause of hypertension, antihypertensive therapy remains empiric. However, certain principles of treatment are emerging; one of these concerns the critical role of the kidney in antihypertensive therapy. Whether or not the kidney is primarily responsible for hypertension in a patient, it is the patient's renal response to treatment that determines, to a major degree, an agent's efficacy. Vasodilators have been a conceptually attractive approach to the treatment of high blood pressure, because they decrease total peripheral resistance, which is considered to be the mechanism responsible for this condition in most patients. Nonspecific vasodilators exert a series of actions on the kidney--including profound sodium retention and reactive renin release--that limits therapeutic response. For reasons that are not yet clear, but are apparently related to specific action on calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle, endocrine function, and renal hemodynamics, calcium channel blocking agents, such as nifedipine, have an advantage in the treatment of hypertension. They cause little or no sodium retention; thus, the addition of a diuretic agent is not required. In fact, there is evidence that sodium loading in certain patients may potentiate the antihypertensive efficacy of these drugs. The renin-angiotensin system seems to be activated to a somewhat lesser degree by calcium channel blocking agents than it is by nonspecific vasodilators; in addition, these agents interfere with the actions of angiotensin on aldosterone release. Moreover, their dilator action on the renal blood supply favors sodium excretion. Nifedipine either has no effect on the renal blood supply or induces an increase in renal blood flow and maintains glomerular filtration rate, both of which combine to support the ensuing natriuresis.", 
    "325": "We assessed renal blood flow and pressor responses to graded angiotensin II doses in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats ingesting a diet containing 1.6% sodium basally and after acute and chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril. In the basal state the pressor response to angiotensin II was enhanced (P<0.0005) and the renal vascular response was blunted (P<0.005) in SHR compared with WKY rats. After acute captopril administration the pressor response was enhanced in both strains, and the difference between them was maintained, while the renal vascular response was enhanced in both, but more in SHR, so that the renal vascular response in the SHR became larger than in WKY (P<0.0001). Chronic captopril treatment blunted both pressor and renal responses in WKY rats, but only the pressor response in SHR. The renal vessels of SHR seem to be different from those of WKY rats in reaction to exogenous angiotensin II, and in response to both acute administration of captopril (probably acting through blockade of angiotensin II production) and chronic administration of captopril (probably acting mainly through accumulation of kinin or production of prostaglandins).", 
    "326": "Increased glomerular capillary pressure (GCP) mediates glomerular damage in hypertension. The efficacy of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide (captopril-TZ) in lowering GCP and preventing glomerular damage was evaluated in rats with two-kidney, one clip (2K, 1C) Goldblatt hypertension and partial ablation of the unclipped kidney. Thirty days after surgery nine rats received captopril, 11 received captopril-TZ and eight served as untreated control rats. Sixty days later systemic hypertension was associated with increased GCP and severe structural damage in the unclipped kidney of C rats. Captopril lowered arterial pressure (AP), and prevented the rise in GCP and structural lesion. Captopril-TZ decreased AP and GCP to a greater extent, but did not reduce structural damage further. Captopril lowered GCP, preventing structural damage; greater reduction of GCP with captopril-TZ did not provide further protection.", 
    "327": "Male Munich-Wistar rats wer subjected to 1 2/3 nephrectomy. One group received no therapy. A second group received the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. A third group received triple therapy (TRX) with reserpine, hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide. Half of the rats underwent micropuncture study 4 weeks after nephrectomy. Untreated rats exhibited high systemic blood pressure (SBP) and single-nephron hyperfiltration due to high values for the mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (-PGC) and glomerular capillary plasma flow rate (QA). The ACE inhibitor therapy controlled both SBP and -PGC. In contrast, TRX normalized SBP but failed to lower -PGC. After 12 weeks untreated rats demonstrated systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria and extensive glomerular sclerosis. The ACE inhibitor dramatically limited proteinuria and sclerosis. Despite equivalent SBP control with TRX, failure to control -PGC resulted in proteinuria and sclerosis comparable with the untreated rats. Thus unless -PGC is controlled, SBP control may be insufficient to prevent renal injury.", 
    "328": "The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of prostaglandins to the reflex cardiovascular responses induced by static contraction of the hind limb in cats, i.e., the exercise reflex. To accomplish this, the cardiovascular responses to hind limb contraction induced by electrical stimulation of spinal cord ventral roots L6-7 and S1 were compared before and after inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin, 2-6 mg/kg i.v., n = 5, or sodium meclofenamate, 2-6 mg/kg i.v., n = 5) or after injection of prostaglandin E2 into the hind limb arterial blood supply. Treatment with indomethacin attenuated the contraction-induced increase in mean arterial pressure and left ventricular dP/dt by 76% and 86%, respectively. Heart rate and average developed triceps surae muscle tension were unchanged. After administering sodium meclofenamate, the reflex response was attenuated to a similar degree. In the indomethacin-treated animals, injection of exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) partially restored the pressor and myocardial contractile responses. In 6 animals, treatment with exogenous PGE2 without prior inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis did not significantly augment the contraction-induced cardiovascular response. Using the radioactive microsphere technique, we measured skeletal muscle blood flow during contraction before and after treatment with indomethacin (n = 6) to determine if an indomethacin-induced alteration in blood flow could account for the attenuated contraction-induced cardiovascular response. Blood flow during static muscle contraction was not significantly altered by indomethacin. We conclude that prostaglandins contribute to the exercise reflex through an action on afferent nerve endings rather than through a regional vascular effect.", 
    "329": "After a 4- to 6-week placebo lead-in period, 382 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressures remaining between 92 and 109 mmHg were randomized to double-blind treatment with captopril (50 mg q.d.) (94), captopril (50 mg b.i.d.) (97), captopril (50 mg q.d.) plus hydrochlorothiazide (97), and placebo (94). After 4 weeks the captopril dosage was doubled, whereas the hydrochlorothiazide dose remained at 25 mg for an additional 4 weeks. Response to treatment was evaluated by means of blood pressure determinations at the end of 4 and 8 weeks. All three active treatment regimens reduced diastolic blood pressure more than placebo did (p less than or equal to 0.01). Patients receiving captopril with diuretic had a greater decrease in pressure than those receiving captopril alone. The once-daily captopril regimen was as effective as the twice-daily regimen, although the latter employed double the daily dose. Increasing the captopril dosage during the second 4-week period resulted in a minimal addition reduction in blood pressure. Full 24-hour monitoring confirmed that the blood pressure was controlled by once-daily captopril therapy. Captopril given once daily, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, is efficacious treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The once-daily regimen should further enhance patient compliance.", 
    "330": "The effect of antihypertensive drug treatment on aortic DNA synthesis was examined in rats with two-kidney, one clip renal hypertension and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats, hypertension developed over a 2-week period. Four days after clipping the renal artery, during the onset of hypertension, there was an increase in aortic DNA synthesis. Aortic DNA synthesis was also increased 3 weeks later, when hypertension had been established. Captopril, hydralazine, and verapamil were each able to prevent the increase in aortic DNA synthesis and the rise in blood pressure when given throughout the first 5 days of the developing phase of hypertension, or when given to rats with established hypertension. Drug treatment of sham-operated rats had no significant effect on DNA synthesis, although blood pressure was decreased. There were no differences in blood pressure or aortic DNA synthesis in 4-week-old SHR, as compared with age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls or normal Wistar rats. At 17 weeks of age, when hypertension was established, aortic DNA synthesis was significantly enhanced in the SHR. Captopril or hydralazine treatment was able to reduce blood pressure and DNA synthesis to levels seen in the WKY. At 21 weeks of age, DNA synthesis in the SHR had declined to the same levels as in the WKY. Captopril, hydralazine, and verapamil may have a common ability to reduce intracellular calcium and therefore inhibit DNA synthesis. In support of this, ouabain treatment, which increases intracellular calcium by inhibiting the Na+-K+ pump, produced a significant increase in the rate of DNA synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "331": "The separate role of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormone action in maintaining arterial pressure was studied in normotensive rats. Four groups were prepared: adrenalectomized (ADX) rats given 6 micrograms aldosterone/24 h (ALDO; n = 9) or 10 micrograms dexamethasone/24 h (DEX; n = 9) by intraperitoneal Alzet pumps, shamoperated controls (control; n = 10) and ADX rats with no hormone replacement (ADX; n = 9). All groups were given 1% NaCl + 2.5% glucose drinking solution. Measurements of plasma corticosterone and aldosterone and urinary aldosterone excretion confirmed the adequacy of the experimental groups. Forty-eight hours after ADX or sham, base-line intra-arterial mean arterial pressure (MAP) in conscious undisturbed rats was similar in the four groups. Captopril (1 mg/kg iv) produced a similar reduction in MAP in ALDO (-11 +/- 2 mmHg) and DEX (-12 +/- 1 mmHg) groups, despite a lower plasma renin activity (PRA) in ALDO (2.0 +/- 0.7 and 6.0 +/- 1.5 ng X ml-1 X h-1, respectively; P less than 0.05). dP (Me)TyrAVP (50 micrograms/kg iv) caused a greater decrease in MAP in ALDO (-15 +/- 3 mmHg) than in DEX (-8 +/- 1 mmHg; P less than 0.05). Combined blockade with both antagonists resulted in a greater MAP reduction in ALDO (-29 +/- 4 mmHg) than in DEX (-15 +/- 4 mmHg; P less than 0.05). These results indicate that glucocorticoid hormone action maintains arterial pressure in ADX rats by mechanisms similar to normal rats and largely independent of the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin. In contrast, mineralocorticoid replacement alone in ADX rats requires increased participation of both peptide systems for maintenance of arterial pressure.", 
    "332": "The ability of the kidney to increase sodium and water excretion in response to increases in perfusion pressure has been recognized for more than 50 years. Because glomerular filtration rate is tightly autoregulated, pressure natriuresis occurs as the result of decreased tubular sodium reabsorption rather than increased filtered load. Micropuncture and microperfusion data support the contention that acute changes in arterial pressure can alter proximal tubule reabsorption; however, studies have failed to show a consistent association between changes in sodium excretion and peritubular, interstitial, or tubular pressures. Thus, the specific intrarenal mechanism for the change in tubular reabsorption in response to an acute change in arterial pressure does not appear to be related to the peritubular physical factors at the level of outer cortical nephrons. The possible roles of angiotensin and prostaglandins as humoral mediators of pressure natriuresis are considered in this report. Although angiotensin II is a powerful modulator of the slope of the pressure natriuresis relationship, the responsiveness of sodium excretion to arterial pressure is actually enhanced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These data suggest that angiotensin does not mediate the basic phenomenon. Recent experiments indicate that intrarenal prostaglandins also modulate the magnitude of the pressure natriuresis relationship, but these hormones do not appear to be essential for its basic manifestation.", 
    "333": "Previous studies have indicated that brain angiotensin II (ANG II) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) may play an important role in the maintenance of hypertension. Preventing the synthesis of ANG II leads to a reduction in blood pressure and, therefore, brain ANG II levels in the SHR should be higher or have increased turnover than in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. To investigate this issue we have dissected discrete areas of the brain from SHR and WKY and extracted, purified and quantified brain ANG II. Significantly higher levels were found in the hypothalamus, striatum, cortex and cerebellum in SHR compared to WKY. The new converting enzyme inhibitor, ramiprilat, injected centrally lowered blood pressure by synthesis inhibition but measurements of brain ANG II after ramiprilat did not indicate increased turnover. Further analysis of the peptide fragments needs to be done before turnover rates can be fully understood.", 
    "334": "Experimental evidence indicates that cyclosporin A (CyA) nephrotoxicity is due to renal arteriolar constriction, reducing renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and delivery of tubular fluid from the end of the proximal tubule to the loop of Henle. The proximal tubular fractional reabsorption (PFR) is increased. Therefore, the impact on renal function of vasodilating agents was studied in rats given CyA. Conscious catheterized rats and clearance techniques were used. In acute experiments a preexisting CyA-nephrotoxicity was resistant to infusion of phenoxybenzamine, prostacyclin, captopril, nifedipine and indomethacin. Concomitant treatment with captopril and CyA did not improve renal function, while concomitant treatment with CyA and nifedipine improved GFR to 1.13 +/- 0.34 ml min-1 g-1 kidney weight (gKW) (n = 19, P less than 0.05), as compared to CyA and placebo treated controls (n = 12, 0.83 +/- 0.32 ml min-1 g-1 KW). Nifedipine also reduced FPR (88.6 +/- 5.1% vs. 83.2 +/- 5.6%. P less than 0.01), and increased lithium clearance from 99 +/- 54 to 184 +/- 64 microliters min-1 g-1 KW (P less than 0.001). The results are further evidence that CyA nephrotoxicity includes renal vasoconstriction, and indicates that calcium entry blockade is nephroprotective in the case of CyA toxicity.", 
    "335": "7 children and adolescents with pulmonary hypertension were examined with regard to the effect of Captopril as well on the pressure in the pulmonary artery and in the right ventricle as on the resistance in the systemic and pulmonary circulation and on the cardiac output. After initial application of Captopril 0.2 mg/kg body weight distinct oscillations of the data were measured, but with the exception of a small decrease of the mean pulmonary artery pressure (-8.5%) no determinable change was noticed. A decrease of the pulmonary artery resistance (-17%), the mean pulmonary artery pressure (-10%) and the right ventricular pressure (-3%) was found under continuous application of Captopril 0.3 mg/kg body weight daily for a period of 7 months. The cardiac output increased (+16%) and the systemic resistance decreased (-16%). The changes of data were not statistically significant. Captopril did not have a reliable therapeutic effect on the pressure and resistance in the pulmonary circulation in children and adolescents with pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "336": "In sodium deplete subjects forearm (FBF) and splanchnic (SBF) blood flows were measured at rest and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) before and during angiotensin II (ANG II) blockade. Both FBF and SBF were reduced by LBNP. Forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance were unaffected by ANG II blockade (intra-arterial saralasin, n = 6; i.v. enalapril, n = 9) both at rest and during LBNP. In contrast, resting SBF increased and splanchnic vascular resistance decreased after i.v. enalapril (n = 10). The low resistance was completely unchanged during the following LBNP. It is concluded that acute ANG II blockade has no influence on the vascular resistance in the human forearm, but increases basal SBF in sodium depleted subjects and 'paralyses' the vasoconstrictor response to LBNP.", 
    "337": "A 57-year-old woman (case 1) and her daughter aged 29 (case 2) with hyperkalemia exhibited subnormal plasma aldosterone (ALD) in the face of elevated plasma renin activity. Their physical findings were normal. Their arterial blood gas analysis showed that metabolic acidosis and renal function of these cases were slightly impaired. Urinary 17-OHCS and 17-KS excretions in these cases were normal. Baseline levels of corticosterone (B) and 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B) were clearly elevated. Plasma deoxycorticosterone (DOC), B and 18-OH-B as well as cortisol remarkable increased after ACTH injection, but the increase in plasma ALD was very small. Angiotensin II infusion in case 1 resulted in a clear rise in plasma 18-OH-B but in slight depletion of B, and no increase in ALD. 9-alpha-fludrocortisone acetate treatment was performed in case 1. Serum potassium was normalized and blood pressure elevated from 82/52 to 120/78 mmHg. Arterial blood gas analysis was corrected. We concluded that these two cases with subnormal plasma ALD and hyperreninemia may exist as a congenital and familial abnormality of the final step of aldosterone boisynthesis due to the impairment of the conversion of B to ALD.", 
    "338": "Recent large-scale antihypertensive treatment trials primarily emphasize the quality of blood pressure control for reduction of cerebrovascular accidents as well as for myocardial infarction, practically irrespective of the type of drug used. Therefore, the best drug that normalizes blood pressure without adverse effects should be sought. On the basis of studies demonstrating cellular membrane and calcium homoeostatic derangements, and an age-dependent transition of overall cardiovascular regulation and peripheral vasoconstrictor forces during the course of essential hypertension, an alternative treatment concept is proposed: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers can primarily be used in younger patients and those with a high renin, while calcium antagonists are used in place of diuretics in older, low-renin or black patients. Age-oriented two-way drug selection enables normalization of blood pressure without untoward effects in about 80% of patients with essential hypertension, and helps to optimize drug combinations in those patients who are difficult to treat.", 
    "339": "A comparison of the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of captopril and enalapril was performed. Forty patients with primary hypertension were treated in randomized order, investigated immediately and in a crossover trial with treatment for 6 weeks, with an intermediate placebo wash-out of 3 weeks. A plasma renin profile was obtained from each patient before treatment. The immediate maximal mean change in supine blood pressure (BP) was similar with both drugs, but occurred earlier with captopril. After 6 weeks of treatment enalapril was more potent than captopril in the mean reduction of supine BP produced. This was even more evident in patients with low-renin hypertension (LRH), where captopril had practically no effect. The different chronic BP response in relation to initial renin activity may indicate different mechanisms or modalities of action. Following the recommended doses and administration intervals of captopril and enalapril, the latter seems more effective, but there seems to be no difference in tolerability.", 
    "340": "Enalapril, either alone or with a diuretic, was administered to 14 children with various renal diseases and hypertension. Five were transplant recipients on immunosuppressive agents. No adverse clinical or laboratory experiences were encountered. Renal function improved in seven children. Normal blood pressure for age was achieved in all 14 children. However, eight children required the addition of a diuretic. In four children blood pressure remained normal despite a reduction in the dose of enalapril. Enalapril was efficacious as a once per day agent. Concomitant ingestion of food did not attenuate the blood pressure-lowering effect of enalapril.", 
    "341": "The aim of the present double-blind crossover study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of enalapril and atenolol in 48 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 2-week wash-out period, treatment was started with either enalapril 20 mg or atenolol 50 mg daily. In patients with a diastolic blood pressure value of more than 90 mmHg after 2 weeks of therapy, doses were doubled. After 4 weeks of therapy, cases were classified as responders (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg) or non-responders (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg) and after a 2-week wash-out phase switched over to the alternative drug for another 4-week therapy period. Both substances significantly lowered mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure to a comparable degree. After 2 weeks, 57% of patients under enalapril and 59% under atenolol shared a satisfactory response, which did not change at the higher dose levels. After 4 weeks of therapy the incidence of side effects was slightly, but insignificantly, higher on atenolol than on enalapril. Thus, our results show that both agents seem equally qualified as first-step drugs in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "342": "As demonstrated in hypertensive humans on the basis of non-invasive Doppler methods, converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) dilate not only small arteries but also large arteries, particularly in the brachial and the carotid circulations. The dilating effect of CEI on large arteries is associated with an enhancement of systemic and brachial arterial compliance, implying a particular action of the drug on arterial smooth muscle. Converting enzyme inhibitors are thus able to reverse the reduced arterial compliance observed in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "343": "Streptozotocin-diabetic rats kept moderately hyperglycaemic by daily injections of ultralente insulin for 4-6 weeks (group DM) demonstrated a higher glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient (delta P), glomerular plasma flow rate and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than was observed in age- and weight-matched non-diabetic controls (group C). This rise in delta P was prevented by therapy with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (15 mg/l drinking water, group DM + E) even though glomerular hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration persisted. Fourteen months after induction of diabetes, animals in group DM displayed high levels of albuminuria and an increased incidence of focal glomerular sclerosis; treatment with enalapril maintained these parameters at levels which did not differ from those observed in group C. We conclude that prevention of glomerular capillary hypertension with enalapril therapy obviates functional and structural glomerular injury in experimental diabetes mellitus.", 
    "344": "Male Munich-Wistar rats were studied 18 weeks after 1 2/3 nephrectomy. One group received no therapy. A second group received the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril, starting 1 week after ablation. Two additional groups received no therapy during the first 8 weeks, and then received ACE inhibitor or a low (12%) protein diet. Early ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in control of systemic and glomerular hypertension (HTN), and a striking limitation of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis. During the first 8 weeks untreated rats developed severe systemic HTN and increasing proteinuria. After 8 weeks proteinuria increased further in untreated rats, and widespread sclerosis resulted. Late ACE inhibition reversed systemic HTN. Both late ACE inhibition and late protein restriction reversed glomerular HTN and prevented further increases in proteinuria and sclerosis. Thus, control of glomerular HTN can stabilize renal injury even when therapy is delayed until hypertension and glomerular injury are established.", 
    "345": "Reduction in functioning nephron number leads to progressive renal disease. A haemodynamic basis for this process has been suggested by studies of partially nephrectomized rats. In this model compensatory hyperfiltration in the remnant nephrons due to increases in the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (-PGC) and plasma flow rate is associated with eventual glomerular sclerosis. Therapeutic attenuation of these haemodynamic adaptations protects against glomerular injury. One such therapy is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, which lowers systemic blood pressure and -PGC and prevents sclerosis in rats with renal ablation, as well as in the hyperfiltering kidneys of normotensive rats with diabetes mellitus. Control of -PGC with ACE inhibitor is also protective even when therapy is delayed until systemic hypertension and glomerular injury are established. In contrast, the control of systemic hypertension but not -PGC affords no protection in remnant kidney rats. Thus, control of glomerular hypertension slows the progression of renal disease.", 
    "346": "Captopril effects were studied in 27 patients with second-stage essential hypertension following administration of a single 25 mg oral dose of the drug. Blood pressure (BP), blood angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, active (APR) and inactive (IPR) plasma renin levels were measured every 30 minutes for 3 hours. Before and near the end of the acute test, urinary kallikrein and catecholamine excretions were measured, and systemic and regional hemodynamic changes assessed. BP decreased in 21 patients: 11 of those had low basal APR (group 1), and 10 had normal or moderately elevated APR (group 2). The greatest hypotensive effect was observed within 1.5 hours after the administration, coinciding with the most marked ACE inhibition. There was no significant intergroup difference with respect to the extent of the hypotensive effect. No correlation was found between the hypotensive effect and the degree of ACE inhibition. All patients showed significantly decreased arteriolar tone, increased venous distensibility, decreased total peripheral resistance, and expanded end diastolic volume, while their cardiac output and heart rate remained unaffected. Hypertensive patients with low APR gave no evidence of renin-angiotensin inhibition or kallikrein-kinin activation that might have accounted for the hemodynamic effect of captopril.", 
    "347": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was measured in rat plasma and tissues by analysis of the binding of the radio-inhibitor 125I-MK351A, a tyrosyl derivative of enalaprilic acid. Labelled 125I-MK351A bound to plasma and tissue ACE preparations and was displaced in a concentration-related manner by MK351A. Scatchard analysis yielded a single line from which MK351A binding sites/mg protein and MK351A dissociation constant were calculated. Tissue and plasma ACE from Sprague Dawley rats was studied over a wide range of sodium intakes (low salt, 0.026 +/- 0.012 mmol/24 h; normal salt, 0.58 +/- 0.09 mmol/24 h; and high salt, 10.4 +/- 1.3 mmol/24 h) and during high salt and DOCA treatment. Across the range of sodium states studied there were no consistent changes in plasma, lung, aorta, brain, epididymis or kidney MK351A binding sites/mg protein, or equilibrium dissociation constant. Calculated MK351A binding sites (nmol/mg protein) were 1.64 +/- 0.14 in lung, 0.47 +/- 0.04 in aorta, 0.44 +/- 0.05 in epididymis, 0.18 +/- 0.01 in brain and 0.053 +/- 0.004 in kidney preparations (n = 24 in each group) reflecting reported ACE enzymatic activity in these tissues.

    "348": "The present study was made to clarify the mechanisms of the antinephritic action of SA-446, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, on crescentic-type anti-GBM nephritis in rats as compared to the actions of spironolactone (an antialdosterone agent), kallidinogenase (a kallikrein agent) and saralasin (an angiotensin II antagonist). SA-446 (25 mg/kg/day, p.o.) had a tendency to reduce the urinary protein excretion and plasma urea nitrogen content. In addition, this drug remarkably inhibited not only glomerular histopathological changes (i.e., crescent formation, the adhesion of capillary walls to Bowman's capsule and fibrinoid necrosis) but also the elevation of blood pressure. Spironolactone (25 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and kallidinogenase (25 KU/day, i.m.) also showed beneficial effects on glomerular histopathological changes and hypertension, although both drugs were not as effective as SA-446. However, saralasin (72 micrograms/day, s.c.) caused a marked aggravating action on this nephritis. This nephritic model showed a marked low activity of plasma renin all through the 40 day experimental period. In this model, the urinary aldosterone excretion was increased, in spite of the decrease in plasma renin activity. SA-446 and kallidinogenase significantly inhibited the decrease in plasma renin activity and the increase in urinary aldosterone excretion. Spironolactone inhibited only the increase in the aldosterone excretion. However, saralasin decreased the plasma renin activity under the control level and strongly increased the urinary aldosterone excretion (about 1.8 times the control level on the 20th day). These results suggest that the antinephritic effect of SA-446 may be related to the antihypertensive action and the increase in renal blood flow through activation of the kallikrein-kinin and prostaglandins systems.", 
    "349": "We have reported previously the characterization of the angiotensin (A) II myocardial receptor and provided biological evidence that the inotropic activities of the octapeptide AII are receptor mediated. In addition to the inotropic activities that this compound demonstrates, it also has potent vascular contractile activities. The decapeptide AI exhibits both cardiac (+)-inotropic and vascular contractile activities. The responses to AI are in large part secondary to conversion to smaller peptides, principally the octapeptide AII. To attempt to separate the inotropic and vascular response to these peptides, several decapeptide A analogs with amino acid substitutions in either the 1, 5 or 7 positions were studied. The compounds were as follows: [Sar1Ile5Ala7]AI; [Sar1Ile5 alpha-MeAla7]AI; [Sar1Val5N-MeAla7]AI and [Sar1Val5Sar7]AI. These analogs were studied in rabbit point-stimulated left atria, isometrically contracting aortic rings and competition for [125I]AII binding to myocardial ventricular membranes. All the peptides exhibited partial AII agonist activities in cardiac and vascular tissues with potencies equivalent to or less than AI. The inotropic and vascular contractile response to the decapeptides was decreased in the presence of the A converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. The inotropic and vascular activities of these compounds in the presence of A converting enzyme inhibitor suggest that A converting enzyme may be responsible for the conversion to smaller peptides. Biologically active compounds were obtained with amino acid substitutions in the no. 1, 5 and 7 positions. Sarcosine substitution in position 1 did not enhance vascular potency as was observed with AII analogs.", 
    "350": "Neural and angiotensin-mediated influences that alter hemodynamic and excretory behavior of the nonclipped kidney of two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats were assessed by sequential acute surgical denervation of the nonclipped kidney and intravenous infusion of converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20881), 3 mg/kg X hr. Normal and two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats (0.2-mm silver clip on the right renal artery 3-4 weeks before study) were prepared to allow study of each kidney. Mean arterial blood pressure of two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats fell significantly from control values of 149 +/- 6 to 135 +/- 6 mm Hg after denervation of the nonclipped kidney. Despite this decrease in arterial pressure, the nonclipped kidney exhibited significant increases in glomerular filtration rate (from 1.00 +/- 0.08 to 1.24 +/- 0.08 ml/min), sodium excretion (from 88 +/- 39 to 777 +/- 207 nEq/min), fractional sodium excretion (from 0.06 +/- 0.02 to 0.54 +/- 0.14%), and urine flow rate (from 3.7 +/- 0.5 to 8.2 +/- 1.1 microliter/min). A significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (from 1.12 +/- 0.07 to 0.85 +/- 0.08 ml/min) with no change in excretory function was observed for the clipped kidney following denervation of the nonclipped kidney. Intravenous addition of converting enzyme inhibitor significantly increased renal blood flow (from 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 10.6 +/- 1.5 ml/min) and sodium excretion (from 777 +/- 207 to 1384 +/- 425 nEq/min) for the nonclipped kidney; blood pressure decreased from 135 +/- 6 to 123 +/- 4 mm Hg, and renal vascular resistance decreased significantly (from 22 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 2 mm Hg X min/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "351": "In this article literature concerning the major drugs used in the treatment of heart failure is reviewed. Because of major discrepancies in results from short term and uncontrolled studies versus long term randomised control trials, only the latter group of studies are addressed in detail. Of 3 randomised control trials of digoxin, 1 has been positive, and 2 negative. Digoxin is probably of benefit to a minority of heart failure patients. Four randomised control trials of oral nitrates have shown a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, and trends favouring active treatment for the indices of exercise capacity and functional status. Of 2 randomised control trials of hydralazine one is totally negative, the other difficult to interpret because of major loss of patients to followup. Of 5 trials of quinazolone derivatives (prazosin and trimazosin), 2 have been positive, 2 showed non-statistically significant trends favouring active treatment, and 1 was completely negative. These results are consistent with a modest benefit of prazosin and trimazosin in some heart failure patients. Five trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) have shown dramatic and consistent benefit in exercise capacity and functional status. These results support a clinical policy of initial treatment with diuretics and addition of either captopril or enalapril for patients who remain symptomatic on optimal diuretic therapy. A trial of digoxin is warranted in patients whose functional capacity remains reduced on this regimen.", 
    "352": "Measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is extremely useful as an aid in the diagnosis and longitudinal evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis. We have detected a human serum ACE-inhibitor which affects the ACE level obtained by activity measurements. The effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline. We recommend that serum ACE be performed with 1:8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ACE inhibitor. The inhibitor has a MW above 50,000 daltons, and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent. Dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible, allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ACE activity greater than 50 units/ml. The source of the serum ACE-inhibitor remains to be determined.", 
    "353": "Renal DTPA studies were analysed to produce numerical data of renal function (blood flow, glomerular filtration, and excretion), and this was used as an adjunct to the routine imaging information in a study of renal artery stenosis (RAS). The results show an overall accuracy of 81%, with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 61%. In patients with RAS, beta-blocking drugs reduced the difference between the two kidneys. ACE-inhibiting drugs appeared to preserve renal blood flow but also to cause a deterioration in the glomerular filtration rate of kidneys with RAS. An explanation is proposed, in which renal capillary pressure is more important for function than is renal blood flow.", 
    "354": "The present study examines acute titration with captopril and chronic follow-up data on captopril and a diuretic in patients with all forms of hypertension. Captopril was initiated in those patients in whom previous antihypertensive agents either failed to control high blood pressure or produced adverse reactions. Acute titration was done in 88 patients in whom average diastolic blood pressure was equal to or more than 95 mm Hg. Initial titration dosage was decided on the basis of initial blood pressure recordings. During initial titration, 5 patients received 12.5 mg, 51 received 25 mg, 28 received 50 mg, and the remaining 4 received 100 mg of captopril. Post-captopril blood pressure data were normalized by using pre-captopril data as 100% for each patient. The blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all 88 patients was statistically significant (p less than 0.05), within forty-five minutes of captopril administration irrespective of the doses. No adverse reactions were seen during the acute titration. After the initial titration, in all 88 patients a diuretic was added to obtain a synergistic effect. Eleven patients were dropped from the study, for they could not follow the requirements of the protocol. In 77 patients the data for a one-year safety profile with captopril and diuretic were available. There were no overall significant statistical changes in serial white blood cell count, serum potassium, and serum creatinine values in those 77 patients. In 31 patients the initial and maintenance dosage of captopril and the diuretic remained unaltered for one year. Post-captopril blood pressure and heart rate data were normalized, pre-captopril data being considered as 100% in those 31 patients. The blood pressure data following captopril and a diuretic therapy compared with the pre-captopril data were statistically significant (p less than 0.05) throughout the study period. However, no significant changes in heart rates were observed during the study period. In all other patients, diuretic therapy was continued throughout the study period. In 6 severely hypertensive patients, an additional beta-blocker was needed for further control of high blood pressure. In 3 severe hypertensives with renal failure, besides a diuretic and a beta-blocker, minoxidil was needed to normalize their high blood pressure.

The hypothermic effect of neurotensin is not modified by the amino-peptidase inhibitor bestatin (50 micrograms, i.c.v.) nor by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (50 micrograms, i.c.v.).

Rat platelets, which are refractory to AGEPC stimulation, underwent shape-change, aggregation and secretion of [3H]serotonin in response to graded doses of RS-PAP and AGEPC. Intradermal injections of histamine, RS-PAP and AGEPC caused a dose-related increase in local microvascular permeability in rats, as measured by the extravasation of plasma containing Evans blue dye. Similarly, histamine, RS-PAP and AGEPC increased cutaneous vascular permeability when injected intradermally in guinea pigs. The vascular permeability induced by histamine and RS-PAP, but not by AGEPC, was partially inhibited by pretreatment with an antihistamine (diphenhydramine HCl). Pretreatment of guinea pigs with captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), partially inhibited cutaneous responses to subsequent intradermal injections of histamine, RS-PAP and AGEPC. Regardless of pretreatment with diphenhydramine or captopril, skin test sites injected with large amounts of RS-PAP became hemorrhagic within minutes and necrotic within 12 hours.", 
    "357": "Congestive heart failure is a clinical syndrome with inadequate cardiac output and increased venous pressure, characterized by hyperfunction of the sympatho-neuro-endocrine system, favoring maximal vasoconstriction in non-essential organs and retention of salt and water. Identification of the cause of heart failure and its correction is the best treatment. The suppression of precipitant factors is also essential. Traditionally the treatment of congestive heart failure is based on diuretics, restriction of salt intake, and digitalis. The conventional vasodilators are effective in the short term, but they have a marked tendency to tachyphylaxis. The inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme are, through their specific action on neuro-endocrine dysregulation, the most important advance in recent years. Of the non-glycosidic inotropic agents used in severe heart failure, the new inhibitors of phosphodiesterase need further testing. In certain cases, permanent synchronous pacing has to be considered.", 
    "358": "Persons with persisting (at least 3 measurements over several weeks) borderline blood pressure elevation or established hypertension should always be instructed to follow general non-pharmacological measures. Antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is recommended in the following situations: in hypertensive emergencies, immediately; if the hypertension is not due to a surgically remediable cause, in patients with documented (at least 3 measurements) blood pressure elevation to diastolic values greater than 100 mm Hg; in patients with \"mild\" hypertension (diastolic up to 104 mm Hg) which does not decrease to less than 160/95 mm Hg following 3 to 6 months of treatment with general non-pharmacological measures; in persons with borderline blood pressure values (141-159/91-94 mm Hg) that persist following 6 to 12 months of general measures and only if they have severe additional cardiovascular risk factors; in patients with pronounced isolated systolic hypertension (greater than 180 mm Hg). In elderly patients who are frail or have evidence of advanced cardiovascular disease, dementia or other debilitating illnesses, blood pressure-lowering drugs should generally be reserved for diastolic blood pressure values consistently exceeding 110 mm Hg. There have recently been important new developments in antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. Two new pharmacological principles, the calcium entry blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, have been introduced widely into practical hypertension treatment. On the other hand, concern has arisen that the conventional, thiazide-diuretic based therapy, despite its established beneficial influence on blood pressure and most cardiovascular complications, may not significantly improve or may sometimes even adversely affect coronary prognosis because of metabolic side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "359": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in compound 48/80 (3 mg/kg s.c.)-induced thirst in rats was investigated. Bilateral nephrectomy attenuated drinking induced by compound 48/80 but not by polyethylene glycol (PEG) (30%, 5 ml s.c.). Pretreatment with tripelennamine (histamine H1-receptor antagonist, 40 mg/kg i.p.) prior to the administration of compound 48/80 reduced the effect of compound 48/80 on drinking, but pretreatment with cimetidine (histamine H2-receptor antagonist, 40 mg/kg i.p.) or propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect. The effect of SQ 14,225 (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) in various concentrations (0.5-100 mg/kg s.c.) was investigated on the drinking response caused by compound 48/80 (3 mg/kg s.c.), PEG (30%, 5 ml s.c.), isoprenaline (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) and hypertonic saline (5.8%, 2 ml s.c.). SQ 14,225 at a dose of 50 mg/kg significantly attenuated the compound 48/80-induced water intake when administered within 30 min prior to the injection of compound 48/80.

This mechanism consists of an initial fast formation of a weaker enzyme-inhibitor complex (Ki = 130 nM for 2 and 180 nM for 3) followed by a slow reversible isomerization to a tighter complex with measurable forward (K3) and reverse (k4) rate constants (k3 = 4.5 X 10(-2) s-1 for 2 and 5.4 X 10(-2) s-1 for 3; k4 = 9.2 X 10(-3) s-1 for 2 and 3.5 X 10(-3) s-1 for 3). For the remaining three inhibitors, phospho-Ala-Pro (1), (O-benzyl-phospho)-Ala-Pro (4), and (P-phenethylphosphono)-Ala-Pro (5), a one-step binding mechanism (mechanism A) is observed under the conditions of the experiment. The second-order rate constants k1 (M-1 s-1) for the binding of these inhibitors to converting enzyme are found to have values more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the diffusion-controlled limit for a bimolecular reaction involving the enzyme, viz., 3.9 X 10(5) for 1, 2.2 X 10(5) for 4, and 4.8 X 10(5) for 5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "361": "The purpose of these experiments was to study the possible contribution of bradykinin to normal blood pressure maintenance. The bradykinin analogue B4146, a competitive antagonist-partial agonist of bradykinin, was used in three groups of normotensive unanesthetized Wistar rats. Two intra-aortic injections of B4146 (1 mg in 0.2 ml of dextrose) were given 5 minutes apart (i.e., well after return of blood pressure to baseline, which occurred within 68 +/- 19 seconds). One group had been pretreated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor HOE 498, 1 mg/kg (Hoechst), and one received only dextrose as the first injection to serve as controls. The bradykinin antagonist produced an average increase in mean arterial pressure of approximately 13 mm Hg for all groups. In five animals, however, the first injection of B4146 produced a hypotensive effect, whereas the second one consistently produced a rise in blood pressure. Pretreatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor did not affect the magnitude of the subsequent blood pressure increase in response to B4146. Since smaller doses of B4146, sufficient to block exogenous bradykinin, do not cause changes in normal blood pressure, we conclude that endogenous bradykinin does contribute to normal blood pressure maintenance, but its effect can be demonstrated only if very high doses of its antagonist are injected, maybe because a high concentration of the compound is necessary to displace not only circulating but possibly tissue receptor-bound bradykinin as well.", 
    "362": "The mechanisms by which neurotensin (NT) was inactivated by differentiated neuroblastoma and HT29 cells were characterized. In both cell lines, the sites of primary cleavages of NT were Pro7-Arg8, Arg8-Arg9 and Pro10-Tyr11 bonds. The cleavage at the Pro7-Arg8 bond was totally inhibited by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Prolyl-Prolinal and therefore resulted from the action of proline endopeptidase. This peptidase also contributed in a major way to the cleavage at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond. However the latter breakdown was partly due to an NT-degrading neutral metallopeptidase. Finally, we demonstrated the involvement of a recently purified rat brain soluble metalloendopeptidase at the Arg8-Arg9 site by the use of its specific inhibitor N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-2-Phenylethyl]-alanylalanylphenylalanine-p-amino benzoate. The secondary processing of NT degradation products revealed differences between HT29 and N1E115 cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme was shown to degrade NT1-10 and NT1-7 in N1E115 cells but was not detected in HT29 cells. A post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity converted NT9-13 into NT11-13 in HT29 cells but not in N1E115 cells. Finally bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidases rapidly broke down NT11-13 to Tyr in both cell lines. Models for the inactivation of NT in HT29 and N1E115 cells are proposed and compared to that previously described for purified rat brain synaptic membranes.", 
    "363": "Three putative pressor systems, the alpha-adrenergic system (AS), the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and the arginine vasotocin system (AVT-S), were studied for their roles in blood pressure regulation and their possible interactions in the rat snake. Ptyas korros. Norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin I (ANG I), and arginine vasotocin (AVT) increased the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the snake while administration of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, and captopril, an ANG-converting enzyme inhibitor, but not KBIV24, an AVT antagonist, decreased the MAP. Treatment with any combination of two of these antagonists/inhibitor invariably decreased the MAP. Treatment with the agonist of the remaining third system invariably returned the MAP to normal or above. Phentolamine and KBIV24 attenuated the vasopressor effect of ANG I. Phentolamine and captopril enhanced the vasopressor effect of AVT. The pressor effect of NE was not altered by KBIV24 and captopril. It was concluded that there were at least two pressor systems (AS and RAS) regulating the basal MAP in the snake. There was also interaction among the three systems which could affect the MAP.", 
    "364": "The cause of pulmonary hypertension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is considered to be hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which may be mediated in part by angiotensin II. We administered captopril (25 mg, orally) to seven patients with COPD and complicating cor pulmonale in stable state. Hemodynamic responses were recorded before and one hour after the administration of the drug. Captopril increased cardiac output by 23% (p less than 0.025) and reduced mean systemic pressure by 12% (p less than 0.004), but did not alter mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance fell, respectively, by 14% (p less than 0.035) and 31% (p less than 0.03). There was an increase in pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio (p less than 0.007). Heart rate, mean right atrial, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, arterial oxygen tension and dioxide tension, and alveolar- arterial oxygen tension difference remained unchanged. These results suggest that captopril is successful in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance without affecting arterial blood gases, but does not change mean pulmonary arterial pressure probably because of the concurrent increase in pulmonary blood flow. In addition, results indicate that captopril has more effects on the systemic vasculature than on the pulmonary circulation.", 
    "365": "Mild Cushing's syndrome was diagnosed in a 35 year old woman. Elevated plasma and urinary cortisol levels were unsuppressible with up to 32 mg dexamethasone per day. Aldosterone, 18-OH-corticosterone and testosterone in plasma were normal and dehydro-epiandrosterone-sulphate was low. No adrenal tumour was found by CT or adrenal venography, and bilateral cortisol secretion was demonstrated by steroid measurements in adrenal venous blood. A circadian rhythm of plasma cortisol was absent. Plasma ACTH was suppressed, even after injection of CRH, during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and after metyrapone administration, which led to a large fall in plasma cortisol but to a subnormal rise of plasma 11-deoxy-cortisol. The clinical diagnosis of primary micronodular adenomatosis of the adrenal gland was histologically confirmed, when the patient finally underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. In vitro, the adrenal cells did not produce more cortisol and aldosterone than adrenal cells from cadaver kidney donors. In vivo and in vitro, cortisol was slightly less than normally responsive to ACTH. Intermittent treatment of the patient with 800 mg/day of ketoconazole led to a rapid fall of cortisol secretion and clinical signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. Treatment for 7 weeks with 200-400 mg ketoconazole per day reduced plasma and urinary cortisol less dramatically into the normal range. This case unequivocally documents autonomous dysfunction of the adrenal cortex in this rare form of Cushing's syndrome and the efficacy of ketoconazole in the treatment of ACTH-independent hypercortisolism.", 
    "366": "The effect of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the progression of chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis was examined. Rats were injected with 15 mg/100 gm body weight PAN and 5 mg/100 gm body weight, on weeks - 1 and 5, respectively. A third group was injected with an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline, intraperitoneally (Group III) on week - 1 and 5. Beginning week 0, group I received 50 mg/kg captopril daily in the drinking water for 12 weeks. Group II received no treatment. Captopril failed to attenuate the peak level of proteinuria induced by the first injection of PAN or to alter the rate of decline of proteinuria when begun 1 week after the PAN injection. However, captopril did blunt the increase in urinary protein excretion following the second injection of PAN (p less than 0.05). Group II became hypertensive compared to Group I on week 8 and 12 and Group III on week 12 (p less than 0.05). Group I and II could not be distinguished on the basis of renal histologic rank (p = 0.80). We conclude that captopril affords some protection against the development of PAN-induced proteinuria, but it does not accelerate the recovery phase when glomerular permselectivity is being regained.", 
    "367": "The feasibility and reliability of home blood pressure measurement in clinical research were determined as part of a study to document the safety and efficacy of two captopril dosage regimens. Twenty patients were studied. Patients were instructed to record blood pressures twice daily (before morning and evening doses of captopril) for 24 weeks. All patients were instructed in blood pressure measurement and were required to demonstrate the accuracy of their techniques. Supine and standing blood pressures were measured every two weeks in the clinic. The mean of all home blood pressures recorded in the two-week period before each clinic visit was compared with the measurement obtained at that clinic visit for each patient. Blood pressure data could be evaluated for 17 patients. Each patient recorded 330-380 readings, and the mean home blood pressure measurement for each two-week period was calculated from 26-32 separate readings. Home blood pressures were consistently lower than clinic measurements but showed similar trends in response to treatment. There was good correlation between values obtained at home and in the clinic. Morning and evening blood pressures obtained by patients were not significantly different. Home blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool in hypertension research.", 
    "368": "The experiments on the electrical stimulation of the isolated guinea-pig ileum have shown that captopril (10(-6)-10(-4) g/ml) caused dose-dependent inhibition of the organ contractions, abrogated by naloxone. In mice, the drug in the doses of 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg administered subcutaneously had hyperalgesic effect and, with the dose increase (1-25 mg/kg), progressively attenuated the degree of nociceptive reactions caused by thermal and chemical stimulation. When kininogen accumulations were depleted due to the injection of kininogenase activator-cellulose sulfate, captopril in all the doses studied had an analgetic effect, with it reduced by naloxone. The data obtained show that dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase inhibition by captopril can affect the degree of nociceptive reactions caused by various nociceptive stimuli.", 
    "369": "There is some evidence that increased prostaglandin synthesis may mediate some of the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. The potential role of prostaglandin (PG)I2 in this process was assessed by measurement of changes in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion after captopril in eight sodium replete and depleted conscious dogs. In sodium replete animals captopril induced a small decrease in blood pressure, transient increases in effective renal plasma flow and urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion, and progressive increases in plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary sodium excretion. By contrast, during sodium depletion captopril induced a large decrease in blood pressure, a transient increase in effective renal plasma flow and urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion, an early large but transient increase in PRA and small progressive increase in sodium excretion. The time course of changes after captopril suggested that increased PGI2 synthesis may contribute to the transient decrease in renal vascular resistance. The increase in PRA during sodium depletion was not associated with any change in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion.", 
    "370": "Enalapril (E) was used to treat 16 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, 6 primary and 10 secondary, 5 of the latter with congenital heart disease and 5 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The average dose of E was 20 mg/day. All patients underwent pre and post-treatment cardiac catheterization with determination of pressures at: right atrial (RA), main pulmonary artery (MPA), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( VCP) and systemic arterial (SA). Resistances forces were also measured as; total pulmonary (TPR), pulmonary arteriolar (PAR) and total systemic (TSR) as well as cardiac output (CO), and echo and electrocardiograms, chest x ray, stress test and respiratory function test. The functional class (NYHA) improved in all (p less than 0.001). The initial mean pressures were: RA 12.24 +/- 4.35; MPA 73.81 +/- 25.16; VCP 12 +/- 2.73 and SA 89 +/- 14; TPR 1477 +/- 761; PAR 1243 +/- 730 and TSR 1684 +/- 505.5; CO 4.5 +/- 1.29. The final values were: RA 9.66 +/- 2.46 (p less than 0.001); MPA 63.26 +/- 24.45 (p less than 0.001); VCP 11.33 +/- 2.38 (p = NS); SA 81 +/- 10 (p less than 0.001); TPR 1009.5 +/- 536.7 (p less than 0.001); PAR 829 +/- 511.5 (p less than 0.001); TSR 1309.6 +/- 296.3 (p less than 0.001); CO 5.2 +/- 1.44 (p less than 0.001). The average of minutes on treadmill was initially 8.2 +/- 2.45 and final 12.46 +/- 3.0 (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that enalapril is a useful drug in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension of any etiology.", 
    "371": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats aged 4 and 16 weeks were given an acute oral dose of either Perindopril (3 mg/kg) or vehicle. Direct blood pressure (BP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) were measured, and renal vascular resistance (RVR) calculated. GFR and RBF were lower in vehicle-treated SHR than WKY at 4 weeks of age, but were not different at 16 weeks. Acute Perindopril increased GFR and RBF and reduced RVR in both strains at both 4 and 16 weeks. Total body sodium, sodium intake and blood pressure were measured in SHR and WKY from 1 to 28 weeks of age. Rats of both strains were treated daily between 4 and 16 weeks of age with either Perindopril (3 mg/kg per day) or vehicle. Chronic Perindopril treatment prevented the development of hypertension in the SHR. From 16 to 28 weeks of age, after stopping Perindopril, BP rose slowly in SHR, but remained lower than vehicle-treated SHR. No changes in total body sodium occurred during Perindopril treatment. GFR and RBF were measured in SHR and WKY chronically treated with either Perindopril or vehicle, 3 days or 12 weeks after stopping treatment. In WKY, GFR and RBF were not different between Perindopril-treated and untreated rats at either measurement. In SHR, GFR and RBF remained significantly higher in rats previously treated with Perindopril at both ages. These findings suggest that renal haemodynamic abnormalities may be important in the initiation of hypertension in the SHR. These renal circulatory abnormalities and the hypertension of the SHR depend, at least in part, on intact converting enzyme activity, yet appear to be independent of abnormalities of total body sodium. At a later age, hypertension seems to develop independently of renal vascular abnormalities.", 
    "372": "The effects of a new angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), perindopril (P), on genetic hypertension development (GHD), on mesenteric arteriolar compliance and reactivity to noradrenaline and on myocardial and aortic hypertrophy, have been investigated at intervals in SHRs. P (4 mg/kg, q.d.) was administered by gavage from the 4th to the 20th week of age and measurements were performed 20 hr after the preceding drug intake. P completely prevented GHD, maintaining systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 130 mmHg during the whole treatment period. Furthermore, 7 weeks after treatment withdrawal, SBP of previously treated SHRs was still significantly lower than that of controls. Vascular compliance and internal diameter of the mesenteric arteriole were significantly increased in P-treated SHRs as compared to controls at the age of 20 weeks but these effects did not persist 7 weeks after treatment withdrawal. P did not affect mesenteric arteriolar reactivity to noradrenaline. Finally, P significantly reduced myocardial and aortic hypertrophy in SHRs. Thus P strongly opposed the morphological and functional vascular alterations which usually occur in SHRs during GHD. This property, presumably related to converting enzyme inhibition within the vascular wall, probably contributes to a large extent to, but is not exclusively responsible for, the drug-induced prevention of GHD.", 
    "373": "The humoral and antihypertensive activities of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor 2-[N-[(S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-(1S, 3S, 5S)-2-azabicyclo[3.3.0] octane-3-carboxylic acid (ramipril, Hoe 498) were investigated in 10 patients with essential hypertension (WHO stage I or II). After a 7-day placebo period, the patients were treated with 5 mg ramipril orally once daily for 14 days. Peak serum concentrations of the active metabolite M1 (dicarboxylic acid) of 5.4-62.0 ng/ml were observed 2-6 h after the first oral dose. The maximum ACE inhibition of 95% was reached 2-4 h after the first oral dose, inhibition exceeded 70% 24 h after dosing. The maximum drop in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (random zero sphygmomanometer) was measured 4 h after ramipril (p less than 0.02, p less than 0.01), but blood pressure on days 7 and 14 of the treatment period was not different from pretreatment values. Automatically recorded blood pressure results showed a marked reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure during treatment compared to placebo. No side effects occurred. From the present data it is concluded that ramipril is a potent ACE inhibitor in hypertensive patients and that further controlled studies are required for the evaluation of the antihypertensive effect of 5 mg ramipril in essential hypertension.", 
    "374": "Paw oedema in the rat by carrageenin and kaolin partially caused by Hageman factor activation was potentiated by the new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor 2-[N-[(S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl-L-alanyl]-(lS,3S,5S)-2- azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3-carboxylic acid] (ramipril, Hoe 498) due to its inhibition of kininase II which results in increased bradykinin levels. A dose of 1 microgram ramipril injected into the hind paw of Sprague-Dawley rats concomitantly with, or 1 mg/kg given orally 30 min before administration of the irritants, led to significantly increased inflammatory reactions. The same effects were observed when ramipril was administered 3 h after carrageenin. In the kallikrein-kinin-deficient Brown-Norway rat strain Mai Pfd/f, ramipril did not significantly alter the paw oedema induced as described above. In addition, pretreatment of Sprague-Dawley rats with 10 mg/kg i.v. bromelains completely prevented the potentiation of inflammation by ramipril. Paw oedema provoked by the Hageman factor non-activators serotonin, dextran, ovalbumin and anti-rat IgG was not potentiated by ramipril. The chronic adjuvant arthritis in Lewis rats was not influenced by daily oral treatment with 0.1-3 mg/kg ramipril. Thus, in the rat only those inflammatory reactions involving kinins, presumably generated by Hageman factor activators, are potentiated by ramipril and presumably by other ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "375": "In congestive cardiac failure myocardial deficiency is accompanied by neurohormonal dysfunction with reflex stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These two systems act synergistically, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction with increased vascular resistance and therefore greater demand on left ventricular haemodynamics. The role of the RAAS is better understood when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are used. The vasodilatation produced by these inhibitors mostly affects those vascular beds that depend on the vasopressor effect of angiotensin II, and primarily the renal vascular system: glomerular filtration is improved, and sodium excretion is increased. The RAAS has little influence on the other regional blood flows, so that the administration of ACEI is not followed by cutaneous, muscular or visceral vasodilatation. However, the cerebral blood flow remains normal or even increases despite the fall in systemic arterial pressure, and the coronary output is preserved. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors produce a strong, though selective, vasodilatation without reflex tachycardia, benefiting primarily the kidneys. The resulting increase in sodium excretion contributes to the long-term effect of ACEI in the treatment of congestive cardiac failure.", 
    "376": "Enalaprilate, an antihypertensive agent that inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, is not directly absorbable. It is therefore administered as an inactive precursor, an \u00e9nalaprilate ester which is hydrolysed in vivo with an ultimate bioavailability of 30-40 p. 100. Enalaprilate is entirely excreted through the kidney. With repeated administrations steady state is rapidly reached, and the drug does not accumulate. The effective half-life is 10 hours. Kinetics are linear and depend on renal function. These data, obtained in healthy volunteers with 10 mg doses, also apply to hypertensive patients receiving 20 mg. Following a 20 mg per day dose a more than 50 p. 100 inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme is maintained for 24 hours. In patients with moderate renal impairment or in elderly people (creatinine clearance greater than 30 ml/min), plasma concentrations are slightly increased and there is no need for dosage adjustment. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 ml/min) plasma concentrations are considerably increased with a risk of strong accumulation, and dosage must be reduced to 5 or 2.5 mg per day.", 
    "377": "An angiotensin-converting enzyme was isolated from human heart using N[-1(S)-carboxy-5-aminopentyl]glycyl-glycine as an affinity adsorbent. The isolation procedure resulted in an enzyme purified 1650-fold. The enzyme specific activity was 38.0 u./mg protein, Mr = 150 kD. The pH optimum for the angiotensin-converting enzyme towards Hip-His-Leu lies at 7.8, Km = 1.2 mM. The enzyme was inhibited by the substrate (Ks' = 14 mM). The enzyme effectively catalyzed the hydrolysis of angiotensin I (Km = 10 microM; kcat = 250 s-1). NaCl, CaCl2 as well as Na2SO4 in the absence of Cl- activated the enzyme, whereas CH3COONa and NaNO3 did not influence the enzyme activity. It was found that the bradykinin-potentiating factor inhibited the cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme with IC50 = 4.0 X 10(-8) M.", 
    "378": "A preparation of closed membrane vesicles derived from the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle of pig small intestine was enriched eight-fold in the activity of 5'-nucleotidase and six-fold in the activity of peptidyl dipeptidase A relative to the tissue homogenate. The membrane vesicles specifically bound [3H]bradykinin and the concentration of bradykinin required to inhibit 50% binding was 0.76 +/- 0.05 nM. This concentration was not significantly different from the corresponding concentration of lysyl-bradykinin (0.45 +/- 0.13 nM) but was less (P less than 0.05) than the concentration of methionyl-lysyl-bradykinin (1.25 +/- 0.10 nM). The concentration of des-Arg9 bradykinin (7.5 microM) required for 50% inhibition was greater than 10(3) times less than bradykinin indicating the presence of a B2-type receptor. The membrane vesicles also degraded bradykinin and the principal metabolite was identified as bradykinin. Des-Arg1 bradykinin, des-Arg9 bradykinin and bradykinin were also formed in low yield. Cleavage of the Pro7-Phe8 bond was inhibited by phosphoramidon but not by enalapril or captopril indicating that proteolytic inactivation of bradykinin in the muscle layer of the intestine is mediated through endopeptidase 24.11 (\"enkephalinase\") but not through peptidyl dipeptidase A (\"angiotensin-converting enzyme\").", 
    "379": "Endothelial cells from pig aortas were labeled with 35S-methionine, and the soluble proteins that were released into the culture medium were examined by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were collected during labeling, and during the intervals 0 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours of chase after a 1-hour labeling period, and during the intervals 0 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 48 hours of chase after a 24-hour labeling period. Release of radiolabeled soluble protein from cells into the medium continued over the longest time periods examined. If the cells were labeled for 1 hour, characteristic patterns of proteins appeared in the medium during the labeling period, early (0- to 3-hour postlabeling) and late (6- to 24-hour postlabeling). The time course of release of fibronectin (Fn) and of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was determined by using immunoprecipitation. ACE appeared only after 6 hours of chase. Fn appeared throughout the chase period. The effects of serum and of the protease inhibitors alpha-2 macroglobulin, pepstatin, and leupeptin on protein release were examined. In the absence of serum, endothelial cell culture medium contained substantial protease activity capable of completely degrading most of the released proteins; a major effect of serum was to protect newly released protein from degradation.", 
    "380": "The purpose of this study was to define the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate, on blood pressure, renal function, protein excretion, and potassium homeostasis in patients with hypertension associated with moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Nine patients, having an initial inulin clearance between 9 and 48 mL/min/1.73 m2, were treated with enalapril monotherapy (n = 6) or enalapril/furosemide (n = 3) combination therapy. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were well controlled. Supine plasma renin activity was stimulated; the supine plasma aldosterone level was suppressed, with a resultant increase in the serum potassium level. Clinical hyperkalemia was not observed. Glomerular filtration rate, assessed by inulin and creatinine clearances, was not significantly changed. Effective renal plasma flow, assessed by paraaminohippurate clearance was significantly increased, with a resultant decrease in filtration fraction. Importantly, urinary protein excretion was markedly reduced. These results suggest that enalapril therapy produces efferent arteriolar dilitation with preservation of the glomerular filtration rate. Enalapril therapy may also blunt the effects of angiotensin II on transglomerular passage of protein, as demonstrated by reduced proteinuria. These findings suggest that interruption of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with preexisting renal disease may have renal protective effects.", 
    "381": "During progressive cardiac tamponade in conscious dogs, cardiac output falls continuously while arterial blood pressure is maintained until cardiovascular decompensation by increases in total peripheral resistance (TPR). Plasma renin activity (PRA) is known to increase at decompensation. We hypothesized that the increase in TPR during cardiac tamponade was mediated by alpha-adrenergic and renin-angiotensin mechanisms. Twelve adult dogs were instrumented to measure cardiac output (electromagnetic flow probe), aortic and right atrial blood pressures, and intrapericardial pressure (IPP). TPR was calculated as the conscious euvolemic animals underwent cardiac tamponade induced by intrapericardial saline infusion at 20 ml/min. Six dogs underwent cardiac tamponade in the control condition (no medications) and during independent alpha- and beta-adrenergic and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. PRA and angiotensin II (ANG II) were measured during control tamponade. We found that TPR increased continuously to levels of greater than 200% of base line as IPP rose during cardiac tamponade (P less than 0.01). This increase in TPR was unaffected by beta-adrenergic or ACE blockade but was blunted by alpha-adrenergic blockade. PRA and ANG II increased only at decompensated tamponade (P less than 0.05) when arterial blood pressure had fallen by 30%. These changes in PRA and ANG II during tamponade were not altered by beta-blockade in six separate animals. We conclude that cardiac tamponade stimulates renin release and ANG II generation by a non-beta-receptor-mediated mechanism. The increase in TPR during cardiac tamponade is primarily dependent on alpha-adrenergic mechanisms, with a limited late contribution from the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "382": "The relative importance of angiotensin II for the renal vasodilatory response after converting-enzyme inhibition was evaluated by a comparison of the effects of converting-enzyme and renin inhibition on renal vascular resistance. Renal, mesenteric, and hindquarter blood flows were measured with chronically implanted ultrasonic-pulsed Doppler flow probes in conscious, mildly volume-depleted marmosets after administration of a converting-enzyme inhibitor (enalaprilat, 2 mg/kg iv), a synthetic renin inhibitor (CGP 29,287, 1 mg/kg iv), or a renin-inhibitory monoclonal antibody (R-3-36-16, 0.1 mg/kg iv). Enalaprilat reduced blood pressure (-16 +/- 4 mmHg, n = 6) and induced a selective increase in renal blood flow (27 +/- 8%, n = 6). CGP 29,287 and R-3-36-16 induced comparable reductions in blood pressure (-16 +/- 4 mmHg, n = 6 and -20 +/- 4 mmHg, n = 5, respectively) and selective increases in renal blood flow (36 +/- 12%, n = 6 and 34 +/- 16%, n = 4, respectively). The decrease in renal vascular resistance was of similar magnitude for all of the inhibitors (enalaprilat -28 +/- 3%, CGP 29,287 -32 +/- 6%; and R-3-36-16 -33 +/- 7%). These results indicate that the renal vasodilatation induced after converting-enzyme or renin inhibition is mainly due to decreased formation of angiotensin II."
