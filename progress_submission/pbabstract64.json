    "0": "The mechanisms responsible for abnormal fluid retention in congestive heart failure (CHF) are unclear. Studies were conducted to elucidate how endothelin (ET) may contribute to salt and water retention. Cardiomyopathic (CM) hamsters with moderate heart failure were employed for in vivo and in vitro trials. Clearance methods were used to compare the level of renal function in CM hamsters and control animals. Radioligand binding studies were also performed to determine ET receptor distribution in the inner medullary collecting ducts. CM hamsters exhibited an attenuated response to ANF infusion (FENa: 2.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.8%, p < 0.01; FEH2O: 1.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.4%, p < 0.01; UcGMP: 11.2 +/- 2.3 vs. 16.6 +/- 2.0 pmol/min, p < 0.05) and a decrease in total ET receptor density (532 +/- 77 vs. 959 +/- 154 fmol/mg protein, p < 0.005). Particularly ETB receptors were significantly reduced (214 +/- 26 vs. 483 +/- 88 fmol/mg protein, p < 0.003). Enalapril therapy simultaneously restored the natriuretic and diuretic effects of ANF and ET receptor density in the diseased animals. These studies suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and ET hormonal system act together, via ETB receptor downregulation, to promote the abnormal fluid retention observed in CHF.", 
    "1": "Calcium antagonists have, to date, shown disappointing effect in chronic heart failure (CHF), possibly due to their cardiodepressant effects and/or reflex increases in sympathetic tone. Mibefradil is a new, selective T-channel calcium antagonist which has no relevant effects on cardiac contractility, sympathetic activity or neurohormonal levels. This study compares the effect of mibefradil with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on systemic and cardiac hemodynamics, cardiac structure and survival in a rat model of CHF. Rats underwent coronary artery ligation followed by 9 months treatment with mibefradil, cilazapril or no treatment. Both mibefradil and cilazapril increased survival rate to a similar extent over the study treatment period. Both periods reduced systolic blood pressure compared with untreated rats, although the reduction was slightly more marked with cilazapril than mibefradil. Both treatments decreased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and central venous pressures without any change in the first derivative LV pressure over time or heart rate. Mibefradil decreased LV weight without effecting right ventricular (RV) weight. Both drugs normalized LV collagen density. The data from this study show that long-term treatment with mibefradil results in a survival benefit comparable to that observed with an ACE inhibitor in a rat model of CHF. Mibefradil was also associated with improvements in cardiac hemodynamics, a reduction in LV weight and fibrosis. Mibefradil may be beneficial in the treatment of CHF.", 
    "2": "During the last 2 decades, remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of hypertension with the discovery of new drugs lowering blood pressure by various mechanisms, e.g. calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. These antihypertensive agents are now widely used as first-line therapy although there is still no definite proof that they have a cardioprotective effect and reduce the mortality rate in patients with coronary heart disease. Mibefradil is a new calcium antagonist with a novel mechanism of action since it is the only drug available so far able to block T channels. This compound might be particularly effective in preventing cardiac morbidity and mortality. It reduces heart rate when lowering blood pressure, has no negative inotropic effect, allows regression of cardiac hypertrophy and is effective in the treatment of angina. Mibefradil produces a sustained blood pressure reduction with a close to optimal trough:peak ratio. A major advantage of this novel compound is its excellent tolerability over the dose range recommended (50-100 mg/day). In particular, leg edema is seen clearly less often during mibefradil treatment than during therapy with dihydropyridines. Mibefradil has therefore an attractive profile in terms of both efficacy and safety and represents a promising first-line option to treat hypertensive patients.", 
    "3": "From an economic, mortality, and functional standpoint, heart failure is clearly a disease that needs to be targeted. We can develop a model for heart failure to determine the impact that specific management strategies will have on the overall cost to the system, which by itself can tell us some interesting things because we're currently spending twice as much on transplantation as on digoxin therapy. We can then use this model to assess the impact of different strategies, such as greater use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or digoxin therapy.", 
    "4": "Development of guidelines can be a difficult process; each organization or institution must establish the rules and criteria for including specific therapies and the level of complexity needed. Specific outcomes must be incorporated, including maintenance of comfort and functionality, freedom from hospitalization, and survival. In existing guidelines for the management of heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy is clearly the gold standard. However, there is still a high mortality with ACE inhibitor therapy; the key may be choosing the right patients. Current guidelines reflect the uncertainty regarding digoxin before the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial; obviously, these guidelines should be revisited. Clinical practice guidelines for the management of heart failure need to be revised to include a better consensus on beta-blockade, the new data on digoxin, emerging data on angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and current thinking on anticoagulant therapy.", 
    "5": "3-Bromomethyl-propyphenazone (BMP) was used as a derivatization reagent for the detection and quantification of captopril (CAP) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) by high performance liquid chromatography using Zorbax C8 column, and 0.05M sodium acetate, acetonitrile, methanol (14:17:4; pH 6.5) as mobile phase system with UV-detection at 254 nm. The cited reagent reacts with the mercapto and amino groups of CAP and HCT in acetone using anhydrous potassium carbonate as hydrobromide acceptor. The reaction was completed within 30 min for CAP and 60 min for HCT with heating at 105 +/- 5 degrees C in mini-reaction vial. The linear concentration ranges for both CAP and HCT were 8 to 160 and 6 to 140 ng per injection, respectively. The derivatized captopril was synthesized and confirmed with spectral analysis. This method was applied for determination of spiked captopril in human urine after extraction with Extrelut-20 column using ethyl acetate:isopropanol (85:15 v/v) as eluant.", 
    "6": "Proteinuric renal diseases are associated with excessive renal synthesis of endothelin 1 (ET-1) either in experimental animals or humans. This has been interpreted as an upregulation of ET-1 gene in proximal tubular cells secondary to overreabsorption of an unusual amount of filtered proteins. Here we used a model of chronic proteinuria, passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), to localize the structure of the kidney responsible for excessive ET-1 expression and synthesis and to clarify whether drugs that reduce glomerular protein trafficking modified the distribution of ET-1 mRNA and the corresponding peptide in the kidney. PHN was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats after injection of rabbit anti-Fx1A antibody. Group 1 (n = 5) was untreated, group 2 (n = 5) was given daily the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (40 mg/l) plus the angiotensin II receptor antagonist L-158,809 (50 mg/l) from day 7--when rats were already proteinuric--to month 12. An additional group of normal rats (n = 5) was used as controls. Urinary excretion of ET-1 was significantly increased in PHN rats as compared with controls and normalized by the treatment. By in situ hybridization a weak signal for ET-1 mRNA was detectable in glomeruli, distal tubular segments, and proximal tubules of control kidneys. By contrast, a strong labeling was found in the kidneys of rats with PHN which was mainly localized to proximal tubules and renal interstitium. The pattern of renal ET-1-like immunoreactivity was remarkably consistent with ET-1 mRNA expression. In animals with PHN given the angiotensin II blocking therapy, the urinary excretion of proteins normalized, and the structural integrity of the kidney was well preserved. In the kidney tissue taken from these animals, both ET-1 mRNA and protein staining were quite comparable to controls. These data suggest a link between excessive protein tubular reabsorption and enhanced renal ET-1 in chronic nephropathies and provide a novel explanation for the renoprotective effect in vivo of drugs that, by blocking the biological activity of angiotensin II, reduce glomerular protein traffic and possible deleterious effects of excessive tubular protein overloading.", 
    "7": "The spontaneously hypertensive fawn-hooded (FHH) rat develops severe glomerulosclerosis with ageing. The afferent arteriolar resistance is low, resulting in a strongly elevated glomerular capillary pressure (P(GC)).", 
    "8": "Afferent arteriolar resistance is under the control of the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system, and we studied whether young FHH rats, i.e. at a stage when only mild glomerulosclerosis was present, have diminished TGF responsiveness.", 
    "9": "Maximum TGF-mediated decreases in stop-flow pressure in response to late proximal perfusion with artificial tubular fluid were 9.0 +/- 1.0 mmHg, a value not different or even slightly lower than observed in normal rats. P(GC) was 59.9 +/- 1.2 mmHg and the estimated P(GC) at half-maximal activation of the TGF system (operating P(GC)) was 54.5 +/- 0.8 mmHg at 11 weeks of age (n = 11), a value higher than observed in normal rats. The second question of the present study concerns the effect of chronic angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) administration on P(GC). ACE-i, by reducing angiotensin II (Ang II) availability, diminishes TGF responsiveness, which would offset the beneficial effect on P(GC) under normal flow conditions to the macula densa. Maximum TGF responses were 8.9 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 1.5 mmHg in 11- and 26-week-old rats that had been treated with the ACE-i lisinopril in the drinking water started when the animals were 7 weeks of age. P(GC) was 44.3 +/- 1.2 (n = 9) and operating P(GC) was 40.1 +/- 1.6 mmHg (n = 9) at 11, values significantly lower than in untreated rats. Values remained lower in the 26-week-old treated animals and were 40.9 +/- 0.8 and 32.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg.", 
    "10": "(1) the TGF system in this model of spontaneous hypertension and glomerulosclerosis is intact, despite the fact that the FHH rat has a characteristically low afferent arteriolar resistance as compared to other hypertensive rats; (2) the rat displays a normal or even enhanced function of the TGF system following prolonged administration of the ACE-i lisinopril. The latter finding indicates that the reduction of P(GC) achieved by the ACE-i is not offset by a concomitant attenuation of TGF function.", 
    "11": "Oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) is considered a key event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions. Disturbed generation of coagulatory and anticoagulatory factors by endothelial cells contributes to thrombosis and the progression of atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. In this study, the effects of native LDL (n-LDL) and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) on human coronary endothelial cells were measured. The reaction of coronary endothelial cells to LDL were compared with those of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells grown under comparable conditions. LDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation and copper oxidized. The degree of oxidation was expressed as malondialdehyd (MDA) equivalents and was 0.78+/-0.14 nM MDA/mg LDL for native LDL and 13.63+/-1.18 nmol MDA/mg LDL for ox-LDL. Basal secretion of t-PA and PAI-1 activity were higher in macrovascular endothelial cells. Incubation of n-LDL in concentrations ranging from 3 to 100 microM/ml LDL-protein did not change t-PA-secretion, PAI-1 activity or procoagulant activity in both cell types. Ox-LDL (3 to 100 microM/ml LDL protein) decreased t-PA secretion in a concentration dependent manner from 30.9+/-1.7 to 13.7+/-30 ng/ml per 24 h per 10(6) cells (P < 0.01), increased PAI-1 antigen from 2772+/-587 to 4441+/-766 ng/ml per 24 h per 10(6) cells (P < 0.05) as well as PAI-1 activity from 34+/-6 to 55+/-9 AU/ml per 24 h per 10(6) cells (P < 0.05) in macrovascular endothelial cells but had only minor effects on microvascular endothelial cells. Procoagulant activity measured as coagulation time, similarly increased only in macrovascular endothelial cells from 197+/-6 to 76+/-6 s/24 h per 10(6) cells (P < 0.05). The effect on PAI-1 secretion showed a dependency to the degree of oxidation and could be completely blocked by the antioxidant probucol. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which represents an endothelial enzyme not related to coagulation, remained unchanged during incubation with ox-LDL. Basal ACE activity was higher in microvascular endothelial cells. The higher susceptibility of macrovascular endothelial cells to ox-LDL may partially determine the localization of thrombus formation and the development of atherosclerotic plaques in hyperlipidemic patients.", 
    "12": "The renin-angiotensin system is an important modulator of arterial blood pressure and inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-Is) and are currently used in the treatment of hypertension. The pleiotropic actions exerted by angiotensin II (AngII) on the functionality of the vessel wall may have pro-atherosclerotic outcomes; evidence for an anti-atherosclerotic effect of ACE-Is has been presented and an antioxidant effect has been attributed to thiol-containing ACE-Is, like Captopril. The present study has been undertaken to investigate the effect of Delapril, a lipophilic ACE-I, on the development of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits. While it did not correct hyperlipidemia, Delapril dose dependently inhibited the development of atherosclerosis, expressed as aortic area covered by lesions (23.3+/-4.1, 21.3+/-2.4 and 18.5+/-3.3% with Delapril at the daily dose of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively, versus 38.2%+/-6.4 for control animals) and its effect was similar to that of Captopril (14.5+/-5.1% at the daily dose of 25 mg/kg). Furthermore, Delapril partially and dose dependently restored endothelium-dependent relaxation, which is impaired in vessels from hypercholesterolemic animals (51.80+/-12.18, 59.74+/-5.16, 69.13+/-8.70 maximal percent relaxation versus 48.26+/-3.05% for the untreated control and 67.67+/-6.72% for Captopril-treated animals). An antioxidant mechanism is unlikely to explain this data, since Delapril does not contain thiol groups. These observations suggest that Delapril may represent an effective pharmacological approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis during its early phases.", 
    "13": "Circulating soluble E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) concentrations were evaluated in 93 nonobese essential hypertensive patients, of whom 16 had impaired glucose tolerance and hyperlipidemia (group I); 25 had impaired glucose tolerance (group II); 28 had hyperlipidemia (group III); and 24 had no metabolic abnormalities (group IV). A group of 22 healthy volunteers served as a control group. All groups were without clinical or ultrasound evidence of vascular lesion and were matched for age, sex, and BMI. Endothelial soluble adhesion molecules were measured at baseline, during an oral glucose tolerance test, and after 12 weeks of either enalapril or placebo treatments. Plasma soluble E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 were higher (P < 0.05) in group I and II than in the other groups (group I: E-selectin, 96.1+/-27.1; ICAM-1, 304.0+/-102.1; VCAM-1, 626.1+/-156.2 microg/l. Group II: E-selectin, 88.0+/-18.0; ICAM-1, 268.0+/-84.1; VCAM-1, 594.1+/-140.9 microg/I. Group III: E-selectin, 70.1+/-18.1; ICAM-1, 195.1+/-68.0; VCAM-1, 495.9+/-110.1 microg/l. Group IV: E-selectin, 65.1+/-16.1; ICAM-1, 168.1+/-64.0; VCAM-1, 472.1+/-108.2 microg/l). Soluble adhesins levels were not higher than normal in groups III and IV. Plasma soluble ICAM-1 concentrations increased in group I after glucose administration and were directly correlated with 2-h insulin levels (r=0.648, P=0.007). Compared with placebo, 12 weeks of enalapril treatment significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced soluble E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. Decrements of soluble adhesins were not dependent on enalapril-related blood pressure changes. Therefore, an early endothelial activation was present in essential hypertensive patients with impaired glucose tolerance, regardless of the presence of hyperlipidemia. ACE inhibition counteracted such endothelial activation.", 
    "14": "Angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used for the treatment of heart failure relieve symptoms, increase exercise performance, reduce hospital admissions and prolong life. The large survival studies have used higher doses of ACE inhibitors than those commonly used in clinical practice. NETWORK was set up to compare the effect of dose on the clinical outcome of ACE inhibition.", 
    "15": "1532 patients with heart failure drawn from primary care (n = 619) and hospital sources (n = 913) were randomized to receive enalapril 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 506). 5 mg twice daily (n = 510) or 10 mg twice daily (n = 516). The mean age was 70 years and 65% were male. Coronary heart disease was the cause of heart failure in 71%. Sixty-five percent were in NYHA class II and 35% in class III or IV. The mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 59 (SD 11) mm. The incidence of the primary end-point of death, heart failure related hospitalization or worsening heart failure was assessed after follow-up of each patient for 24 weeks.", 
    "16": "The number of patients reaching the primary end-point was 62 (12.3%) in the 2.5 mg twice daily group, 66 (12.9%) in the 5 mg twice daily group and 76 (14.7%) in the 10 mg twice daily group. Deaths in each group were 21 (4.2%), 17 (3.3%) and 15 (2.9%), respectively. There were no significant differences in the results between the three groups. The crude relative risk for the combined end-point in the 10 mg twice daily group compared to the 2.5 mg twice daily group was 1.20 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.64).", 
    "17": "NETWORK did not demonstrate a relationship between dose of enalapril and clinical outcome in patients with heart failure selected from both primary care and hospital practice.", 
    "18": "Present investigation was undertaken to study the effects of 6 week treatment with spirapril (2 mg/kg po) on insulin sensitivity, and serum lipid levels in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Treatment of rats with spirapril in diabetic and diabetic with hypertensive animals significantly prevented STZ-induced loss of body weight, hypertension, and bradycardia. It also partially but significantly prevented STZ-induced hyperglycaemia in both diabetic Wistar and SH animals. Insulin level was not altered by spirapril treatment. There was significant reduction in cholesterol levels in the diabetic rats. In conclusion, the present investigation presents a number of beneficial effects of spirapril treatment in diabetic and/or hypertensive rats. Spirapril may be considered as one of the drugs of choice in treatment of hypertension when associated with diabetes", 
    "19": "The antihypertensive drug therapy and the peri-operative plasma potassium trend in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing renal transplant were analysed. Out of consecutive 107 live related donor renal transplant, complete data available for 74 patients between June 1991 and March 1993, were entered in proforma and analysed. On the basis of antihypertensive or no antihypertensive drugs prescribed, patients were grouped in 6 categories. Group I patients taking no antihypertensives were taken as control. All patients were comparable for their age, sex, weight, immunosuppressive therapy, anaesthetic and fluid management during surgery. At the time of induction of anaesthesia, patients taking atenolol (plasma K+ levels being 5.34 +/- 0.75 mmol/l in group II and 5.44 +/- 0.63 mmol/l in group III) or captopril (serum K+ level being 5.05 +/- 0.94 mmol/l in group V) in combination with nifedipine and with or without clonidine had significant hyperkalaemia than the patient without antihypertensives (serum K+ level being 4.49 +/- 0.71 mmol/l). Patients, on these two antihypertensives, frequently needed active treatment of alarming hyperkalaemia (blood K+ more than 5 mmol/l and tall 'T' wave in lead II) and cardiac arrhythmias. In conclusion, ESRD patients taking atenolol or captopril are needed to be frequently monitored for blood potassium levels and it would be advisable to avoid these drugs to control hypertension in ESRD patients, especially, when scheduled for renal transplantation.", 
    "20": "Optimizing the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) involves choosing an appropriate dose regimen and target haemoglobin level, addressing factors that inhibit response, and considering appropriate adjuvant therapy. Subcutaneous administration of r-HuEPO two or three times weekly is optimal for most patients. Early detection and treatment of iron deficiency is mandatory. Measurement of the percentage of hypochromic red blood cells is a reliable marker of functional iron deficiency, and the treatment of choice is intravenous iron. Other factors that can affect the response to r-HuEPO include blood loss (sometimes occult), infection, inflammation, hyperparathyroidism with marrow fibrosis, aluminium toxicity, vitamin B12/folate deficiency, haemolysis, bone marrow disorders, haemoglobinopathies, under-dialysis and possibly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These factors should be identified and corrected where possible. Ascorbic acid, vitamin D, folic acid, carnitine, other cytokines and growth factors have all been shown to augment the response to r-HuEPO in some patients. Further research is required before any of these adjuvant therapies can be incorporated into routine clinical practice. With regard to target haemoglobin value, the current practice is to aim for a level of 10-12 g/dl, but it may be argued that a higher target would achieve greater benefits in terms of physical performance, quality of life, and possibly cardiac morbidity and mortality. International multicentre trials are currently in progress to address this issue, as are studies on other substances that may be able to stimulate erythropoiesis.",

The utilization of calcium channel blockers in the context of the recent controversial about their safety profile was also evaluated.", 
    "22": "Drugs from the ATC groups C02, C03 (excluding C03C), C07, C08 (excluding nimodipine and nicardipine) and C09 were included (ATC classification, 1996 version). Drug utilization data and cost figures were obtained from the databases ECOM and FAR-90 of the Ministry of Health. These databases contain the number of packages sold in community pharmacies that are charged to the National Health System. Data are expressed in defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DHD). The cost is expressed in current and constant pesetas.", 
    "23": "The use of antihypertensives increased from 34.78 DHD in 1985 to 103.55 DHD in 1995. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and calcium channel blockers (CCB) are responsible for 89% of the total increase. Thiazides and beta-blockers showed a mild increase, although its relative contribution to the total figures declined from 72 to 32% at the end of the period. Rauwolfia alcaloids and antiadrenergic drugs sales were negligible (0.4% of total sales in 1995). Within the thiazides, consumption was concentrated in products containing > or = 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide or equivalent. Enalapril, captopril, nifedipine and the fixed-dose association of hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride were the most widely used drugs. The cost of antihypertensive drugs in current pesetas raised eight times through the study period reaching 105,501 millions pesetas in 1995; 89% of the cost corresponded to ACEI and CCB. Expressed in constant pesetas the cost increase was four fold. The recent controversia about CCB did not have influence on its consumption.", 
    "24": "The pattern of use of antihypertensive drugs in Spain does not follow the available scientific evidence. Drugs with less documented effectiveness are the most prescribed; even considering the same effectiveness, efficiency is lower for drugs with higher utilization rates. The available presentations for thiazides makes their utilization in the optimal dosification difficult.",

    "27": "In all, 52 patients (17 women, 35 men, 38-73 years) with large acute myocardial infarction were randomized to receive either 25-75 mg/day captopril or 10-20 mg/day fosinopril beginning on the Day 7 after infarction. Of these, 28 had anterior and 24 had posterior wall infarctions. Infarct size was determined by the creatine kinase integral method. Fifty patients were examined by cinemagnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) 1 and 26 weeks after infarction. The following parameters were determined: left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index (LVEDVI, LVESVI), ejection fraction (LVEF), infarct weight, and muscle mass (LVMM). The volume-to-mass ratio (VMR) was calculated and the clinical status according to the guidelines of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) was documented at each examination time. The results were compared with those of a historical sample without ACE-inhibitor therapy examined in an identical manner (n = 31, 10 women, 21 men, 36-75 years).", 
    "28": "LVEDVI and LVESVI increased in the first 6 months after infarction by 24.9 and 36.6%, respectively, in the historical sample; by 11.0 and 7.8%, respectively, under captopril; and by 13.1 and 10.7%, respectively, under fosinopril. LVEF decreased by 14.9% in the untreated sample, by 3.7% under captopril and by 5.0% under fosinopril. Infarct weight and LVMM increased by 12.7 and 15.3%, respectively, without ACE inhibition, by 5.7 and 10.1%, respectively, in patients treated with captopril, and by 6.1 and 9.3%, respectively, in patients treated with fosinopril. The VMR increased by 7.4% in the historical sample, by 3.5% in the captopril group, and by 1.8% in the fosinopril group. The NYHA clinical status improved by 18.2% without ACE inhibition, by 42.9% in the captopril group, and by 26.3% in the fosinopril group. The differences between the two ACE-inhibitor groups and the reference group were all significant, while the differences between the captopril group and the fosinopril group were significant only for VMR (p < 0.01) and NYHA class (p < 0.05).",

We also describe the impact of ACE inhibitor prescriptions, increases in ACE inhibitor dose, and nonpharmacologic educational interventions on readmission-free survival rates.", 
    "31": "We hypothesize that care by a cardiologist physician and higher mean arterial blood pressure on admission are associated with receipt of optimal ACE inhibitor doses.

    "33": "During 1992 and 1993, 387 patients were discharged alive from hospitalization for heart failure. Among patients discharged on enalapril or captopril, 18% received doses recommended by heart failure clinical practice guidelines. Patients discharged on a recommended ACE inhibitor dose were more likely to be African-American and had lower sodium levels and higher mean arterial pressures than patients discharged on lower ACE inhibitor doses. In survival analyses, an increase in ACE inhibitor dose was associated with improved readmission-free survival, independent of left ventricular systolic function type. Receipt of an ACE inhibitor at discharge was also associated with superior readmission-free survival, while nonpharmacologic educational instructions were not associated with improved outcomes.", 
    "34": "Interventions are needed to improve the frequency with which ACE inhibitors are prescribed at recommended doses to hospitalized patients with heart failure. We conclude that among these patients, receipt of an ACE inhibitor at discharge and an increase in ACE inhibitor dose during hospitalization are each associated with measurable effects on readmission-free survival, while provision of educational instructions as currently practiced is not associated with better outcomes.", 
    "35": "Effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the time-dependent variation of kaolin-induced writhing reactions was examined in mice kept under conditions of light from 07:00 to 19:00 and dark from 19:00 to 07:00. The number of writhes was counted for 60 minutes after a single intraperitoneal injection of kaolin at 01:00, 07:00, 13:00, and 19:00. The number of writhes showed a time-dependent variation, with a peak at 19:00 and a trough at 07:00 in the control group. Captopril significantly increased the number of writhes after dosing at 01:00 and 07:00 (during the active period). The ACE activity following captopril dosing was significantly lower in the 07:00 than the 19:00 trial. These results suggest that the pharmacological effect of captopril varies with the dosing time, and the enhancement of the kaolin-induced writhing reaction is greater following dosing of the agent at nighttime in mice.", 
    "36": "The present study was carried out to elucidate whether an exercise-induced increase in plasma hydrogen ion concentration influences aldosterone secretion. Six healthy men (aged 22-25 years) performed two intermittent exercise tests with and without drug administration. The intensities of these exercise tests were 40% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and 90% VO2max, respectively. Administration of 2-mg Dexamethasone and 50-mg Captopril caused an almost complete suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and an enhancement of the elevation in renin concentration during exercise, indicating successful inhibition of ACTH release and angiotensin II production during exercise. While the magnitude of the increase in aldosterone in the drug experiment was depressed compared with the control experiment, a significant increase in aldosterone concentration was observed at the end of the 90% VO2max exercise. Whilst the change in aldosterone concentration did not correlate with the change in plasma potassium concentration, there was a significant correlation between aldosterone and plasma hydrogen ion concentrations in the drug experiment. Since the correlation coefficient was low (r = 0.455), the biological meaning of this correlation should be further investigated. These results would suggest that an elevation of plasma hydrogen ion concentration induced by exercise per se appears to be related, at least in part, with increased aldosterone secretion, independent of the pituitary-adrenal axis, and the renin-angiotensin system.",

If systolic blood pressure remained at >160 mm Hg after 5 months, chlorthalidone or atenolol was added, respectively.

After a 9-month treatment, systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures and radial artery wall thickness, mass and thickness/radius ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.01), whereas carotid compliance increased (p < 0.001). The decrease in radial artery thickness/radius ratio after a 9-month treatment was significantly related to the reduction in pulse pressure (p < 0.01), whereas the improvement in carotid compliance was related to the reduction in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01). In healthy subjects and untreated hypertensive patients, radial artery diameter, wall thickness and thickness/radius ratio and carotid artery compliance did not change significantly during a 9-month observation period.",

    "42": "This study was designed to determine the degree of inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in 5 normal dogs given single doses of conventionally used ACE inhibitors (ACEis). In addition the time required for that inhibition to return to 50% of the difference between maximum and zero (control values) was measured as an estimate of duration of action. The 5 ACEis (with dosages given in parentheses) were benazapril (0.5 mg/kg), captopril (2.0 mg/kg), enalapril (0.5 mg/kg), lisinopril (0.5 mg/kg), and ramipril (0.25 mg/kg). Blood samples for ACE activities were obtained before dosing and at 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, and 24.0 hours after dosing. All ACEis except captopril decreased ACE activities to approximately 25% of control by the 1.5- to 3.0-hour sample, and ACE activities returned to 50% of the difference by the 12-hour sample. The value of AVE activity returned to normal by 24 hours for benazapril, whereas values for ACE activity remained below normal for enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril at 24 hours. For captopril, however, ACE levels decreased to approximately 80% of control by the 1.5-hour recording, and returned to levels not different from control by the 3-hour recording. Based upon this study performed on normal dogs given a single dose, no pharmacokinetic advantage or disadvantage is apparent for any ACEi except captopril, which, at the dosage used, decreased ACE levels to a much lesser degree and shorter time.", 
    "43": "We have experienced a case of anaphylactoid reaction on receiving autologous blood transfusion through a WBC filter for packed red blood cell (PRBC). The patient was a 71-year-old man with a history of hypertension treated with oral antihypertensive drug; enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, who received anesthesia for Y-graft replacement. Autologous blood was obtained after the induction of general anesthesia in the operating room. Upon starting to return the stored blood with an unintentional use of a WBC filter, arterial blood pressure (ABP) fell within the first minute of the transfusion. We obtained three blood samples; pre-filtered blood (PRE), postfiltered blood (POST) and arterial blood (CIRC) after the event, and analyzed concentrations of bradykinin (BK), high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and high molecular weight kininogen-light chain (HMWK-LC). BK was higher in POST than in PRE. HMWK was lower in POST than in PRE, while HMWK-LC was higher in POST than in PRE. HMWK in CIRC was lower than in PRE, and HMWK-LC was higher in CIRC than in PRE. HMWK and HMWK-LC changes after the event suggest that BK formation cascade in the patient was activated on receiving the transfusion. ACE inhibitors were reported to augment such activation. The WBC filter has the negatively charged surface on filteration material and may activate the cascade. While WBC filters can avoid transfusion related reactions, hemodynamic responses should be watched closely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "44": "Urinary albumin excretion (U(alb)V) increases following dietary protein augmentation (DPA) in nephrotic humans and rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) blunt, but do not entirely prevent, increased U(alb)V at doses that reduce blood pressure and entirely block the pressor effect of exogenously administered angiotensin I (Ang-I), suggesting that angiotensin II (Ang-II) might not mediate the effect of DPA on U(alb)V. We determined the effect of losartan (Los), a specific Ang-II receptor antagonist, and compared its effect to that of enalapril (En), an ACEI, on DPA-induced increase in U(alb)V in rats with passive Heymann nephritis (HN). When Los was administered to HN rats for 48 h prior to DPA from 8.5 to 40% casein. U(alb)V increased in an identical fashion in treated and untreated rats, even though Los caused hypotension and prevented the pressor effect of infused Ang-II. Only on day 6 after DPA did U(alb)V decrease. We then measured the effect of duration of pretreatment with Los on Ang-II binding to isolated glomeruli. Maximal inhibition of Ang-II binding required treatment with Los for 6 days. We then pretreated HN rats with either En or Los for 6 days prior to DPA. In contrast to administration of Los for 2 days prior to DPA, pretreatment with either Los or En for 6 days entirely prevented any increase in U(alb)V. We then increased dietary NaCl from 0.2% to 2% (HS) to determine whether En or Los would modulate U(alb)V after DPA when Ang-II activity was suppressed. En reduced the DPA-mediated increase in U(alb)V regardless of dietary NaCl, while Los was effective only in when dietary NaCl was reduced (0.2%), suggesting that under these conditions ACEI reduces U(alb)V by a mechanism that is independent of inhibition of Ang-II and that high protein diets augment U(alb)V by both Ang-II-independent and Ang-II-dependent mechanisms.", 
    "45": "Recent decades have witnessed significant advances in the use of interventional procedures and medical therapies for relief of symptoms associated with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). At the same time, however, little progress has been made in understanding and implementing preventive therapy and risk reduction. Our traditional focus on treatment of severe coronary obstruction has addressed only part of the problem. We now need to adopt a more comprehensive approach aimed at the entire spectrum of atherosclerotic disease. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that risk-reduction strategies can produce marked decreases in the incidence of cardiovascular events as well as in total mortality. Despite this strong body of evidence, risk-reduction therapies continue to be underutilized. Comprehensive changes in healthcare delivery systems are needed to ensure that risk-reduction strategies become a routine part of care for patients with cardiovascular disease.",

Also, LPS administration resulted in an increase in pulmonary myeloperoxidase and protease activities, indicative of a neutrophilic inflammatory response. Pretreatment of animals with liposomal alpha-tocopherol significantly attenuated the LPS-induced edematous lung weight response, and reduced the extent of injuries to the pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells, demonstrated by a significantly smaller reduction in the corresponding enzyme marker activities.",

Rats were treated with the angiotensin converting inhibitor, cilazapril, administered in the drinking water at a dose of 20 mg kg-1 body weight day-1. For the OO diet groups, sciatic nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in diabetic rats was reduced by 32% (p < 0.01) in comparison with nondiabetic (vehicle-treated) rats and 27.5% (p < 0.05) in comparison with diabetic rats treated with cilazapril. Diabetic, cilazapril-treated rats showed no reduction in NCV. For the nondiabetic, diabetic, and diabetic plus cilazapril groups fed GLA, the NCV was not significantly different, indicating that dietary GLA also prevented the deficit in the NCV induced by the diabetic state. Analysis of the sciatic nerve endoneurial phospholipid fatty acids revealed a significant reduction in the proportion of GLA and an elevation in the proportion of linoleic acid in the diabetic groups compared with the nondiabetic groups and this was independent of the cilazapril treatment or the dietary lipid supplement. Sciatic nerve myo-inositol content was unaltered while mannose, fructose, glucose, and sorbitol levels were elevated in the diabetic groups and these changes were independent of the cilazapril treatment or the dietary lipid supplement. These results indicate that in the rat, cilazapril treatment or dietary GLA, at the doses tested, are effective in preventing the deficit in the NCV induced by diabetes.",

From January, 1987, through June, 1996, 43 patients with acute type B dissection were treated exclusively by medical therapy according to our management guidelines. After discharge, aortography and enhanced computed tomography were performed every 6 months to evaluate the diameter of the dissected aorta. All 43 patients survived the acute phase and were discharged alive from the hospital. There was no death related to aortic dissection. Three patients underwent surgical treatment in the chronic phase because of aortic enlargement. Aortic enlargement in 3 additional patients was managed medically. The values for freedom from aortic enlargement for 43 patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 100%, 91%, and 86%, respectively.

    "55": "Cilazapril (CLZ) has been reported to reduce intimal hyperplasia in a rat carotid model of restenosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CLZ inhibits restenosis after deep arterial injury in lathyritic rats. The lathyritic rat was used as a model of deep arterial injury; in this model the internal elastic lamina is easily broken by balloon injury because of the fragility of the connective tissue. Deep arterial injury is defined as rupture of the internal elastic lamina with damage to both the intima and the media. The rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 40): mild injury (intimal damage with intact internal elastic lamina), mild injury +CLZ, deep injury, and deep injury +CLZ. In the CLZ-treated groups, the drug was administered orally (10 mg/day) from 7 days before balloon injury until the time of sacrifice 21 days after balloon injury. The intimal hyperplasia was determined histologically using a computerized morphometry program. At sacrifice, blood pressure was lower in the CLZ-treated groups than in the untreated (control) rats (p < 0.05). In the mild injury model, CLZ decreased intimal hyperplasia markedly. In contrast, CLZ failed to reduce intimal hyperplasia in the rats with deep injury. CLZ markedly decreased neointimal hyperplasia in mild injury. In contrast, CLZ failed to reduce intimal area in deep injury. The type of arterial injury seems to determine the effectiveness of CLZ.", 
    "56": "We investigated cardiorenal responses to acute saline loading in patients with mild congestive heart failure (CHF) with and without angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Saline loading (infusion of 250 ml of normal saline) was performed on 10 patients with mild CHF and 10 control subjects. Although saline loading reduced plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II to a similar extent in both groups, it increased cardiac output, renal blood flow, and the ratio of renal blood flow to cardiac output in the mild CHF group but not in the control group. After saline loading, urinary sodium excretion was higher in the control than in the mild CHF group. In the mild CHF group, saline loading was performed again after an ACE inhibitor (delapril) had been administered for 5 days. Although delapril increased cardiac output and renal blood flow under basal conditions, saline loading did not affect these variables. Delapril improved urinary sodium excretion after saline loading. Thus, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis may contribute to cardiorenal hemodynamics and renal sodium handling in patients with mild CHF. This effect may attenuate the natriuretic response to acute saline loading, and administration of an ACE inhibitor improves this attenuation.",

This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of captopril (1 microgram/kg or 1 mg/kg, i.p.) on the actions of naloxone (5 mg/kg, i.p. in gastric ulceration induced by ethanol and restraint-cold-stress. 2. Neither naloxone (5 mg/kg, i.p.) nor captopril (1 mg/kg, i.p.) alone induced any change in the indices of the ulcer in either group. 3. Captopril at a lower dose (1 microgram/kg, i.p.), when combined with naloxone (5 mg/kg, i.p.), significantly reduced cumulative ulcer length only in the ethanol-treated group (from 54.9 +/- 7.2 mm to 22.5 +/- 6.2 mm). 4. However, a high dose of captopril (1 mg/kg) plus naloxone pretreatment caused a significant reduction in both ethanol (from 54.9 +/- 7.2 mm to 24.9 +/- 6.5 mm) and restraint-cold-stress (from 19.0 +/- 3.0 mm to 5.3 +/- 1.0 mm)-induced ulcer formation. 5. Acetylsalycilic acid, when used together with captopril, increased the ulcer formation induced by stress. 6. Naloxone, by increasing the release of prostaglandins, has been shown to prevent ulcer formation induced by several noxious stimuli. 7. Therefore, the effect of the combination might be due to the synergistic interaction of both drugs on prostaglandin synthesis.",

New pressor protein equivalent to only 0.01 ml human, or rat, plasma injected intravenously quickly raises systolic blood pressure in 300 g anesthetized, ganglion-blocked, bioassay rats by about 15 mmHg. For unknown reasons, this is potentiated to about 45 mmHg after treatment with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (such as captopril and enalapril). New pressor protein activity in rats remains normal 24 h after bilateral nephrectomy, suggesting that it has an extrarenal origin and, furthermore, excluding the possibility of an association with renin-angiotensin system. Systolic blood pressure elevation is greater than the diastolic one, implicating cardiotonic effects. Human plasma new pressor protein was purified using standard biochemical techniques and its N-terminal sequence (19 residues) found to be homologous with the beta factor XIIa fragment of coagulation factor XII. This was supported by demonstrating inhibition of new pressor protein activity in vitro using the factor XII-specific corn trypsin inhibitor. Also, human new pressor protein activity in humans congenitally deficient in coagulation factor XII is very low. The high potency and multiphasic, cardiotonic effects of injected new pressor protein suggest that it interacts synergistically with other systems in the body. This was confirmed by showing that, within 10 min of total bilateral adrenalectomy, responses to new pressor protein decreased markedly.",

Myocardial infarction was anterior in 40%, inferior in 36% and non-Q wave myocardial infarction in 35%. Eighteen percent were subacute myocardial infarction. Killip class on admission were as follow: class I 65%, class II 21%, class III 1% and class IV 11%. Thrombolytic treatment was administered in 29% of patients.

The renin-angiotensin pathway plays a role in the regulation of PAI-1 plasma levels. An insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been related to plasma and cellular ACE levels. In 1032 employees (446 men and 586 women; 22 to 66 years old) of a hospital in southern Italy, we investigated the association between PAI-1 4G/5G and the ACE I/D gene variants and plasma PAI-1 antigen levels. None of the individuals enrolled had clinical evidence of atherosclerosis. In univariate analysis, PAI-1 levels were significantly higher in men (P<.001), alcohol drinkers (P<.001), smokers (P=.009), and homozygotes for the PAI-1 gene deletion allele (4G/4G) (P=.012). Multivariate analysis documented the independent effect on PAI-1 plasma levels of body mass index (P<.001), triglycerides (P<.001), sex (P<.001), PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism (P=.019), smoking habit (P=.041), and ACE I/D genotype (P=.042).

    "76": "Left ventricular (LV) thrombosis can be found in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). No wide multicenter trial on AMI has provided information about LV thrombosis until now. The protocol of the GISSI-3 study included the search for the presence of LV thrombosis in patients from 200 coronary care units that did not specifically focus on LV thrombosis. We examined the GISSI-3 database results related to 8,326 patients at low to medium risk for LV thrombi in which a predischarge echocardiogram (9 +/- 5 days) was available. LV thrombosis was found in 427 patients (5.1%): 292 of 2,544 patients (11.5%) with anterior AMI and in 135 of 5,782 patients (2.3%) with AMI in other sites (p <0.0001). The incidence of LV thrombosis was higher in patients with ejection fraction < or = 40% (151 of 1,432 [10.5%] vs 276 of 6,894 [4%]; p <0.0001) both in the total population and in the subgroup with anterior AMI (106 of 597 [17.8%] vs 186 of 1,947 [9.6%]; p <0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that only the Killip class > I and early intravenous beta-blocker administration were independently associated with higher LV thrombosis risk in the subgroup of patients with anterior AMI (odds ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.39; odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.72, respectively). In patients with anterior AMI, oral beta-blocker therapy given or not given after early intravenous beta-blocker administration does not influence the occurrence of LV thrombosis. The rate of LV thrombosis was similar in patients treated or not treated with nitrates and lisinopril both in the total population and in patients with anterior and nonanterior AMI. In conclusion, in the GISSI-3 population at low to medium risk for LV thrombi, the highest rate of occurrence of LV thrombosis was found among patients with anterior AMI and an ejection fraction < 40%. Killip class > I and the early intravenous beta-blocker administration were the only variables independently associated with a higher predischarge incidence of LV thrombosis after anterior AMI.",

Renal function by radionuclide studies of renal plasma flow, GFR, and plasma endothelin-1 concentration was determined. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers had a renal function impairment characterized by a normal GFR and a significant reduction in renal plasma flow as reflected by MAG3 clearance (199.20 +/- 58.85 ml/min per 1.73 m2 versus 256.54 +/- 60.14 ml/min per 1.73 m2; t = 3.52, P < 0.001). MAG3 clearance was significantly correlated with age and smoking. The renal dysfunction was associated with an increase in plasma endothelin-1 concentration (21.56 +/- 1.15 pmol/L versus 25.01 +/- 3.21 pmol/L; t = 5.00, P < 0.001). Former smokers as well had similar, although milder, abnormalities.

    "78": "A dramatic increase in catecholamine (CA) concentration is believed to be a primary trigger of the neurally mediated syncope (NMS) in elderly subjects. The hypercontractile state of the heart might be alleviated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor through depression of CA release from the sympathetic nerve ending. Thus ACE inhibitor might have positive effect on the prevention of NMS. In this study, 24 elderly subjects who had reproducible NMS induced with head-up tilt test (HUT) were randomized and double-blind divided into placebo and ACE-inhibitor groups. The plasma CA concentration [norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E)] were measured during HUT, and the effects of enalapril on NMS were observed in the two groups. Before administration of enalapril, plasma CA concentrations were significantly increased during HUT compared with those in the supine position; In contrast, administration of the enalapril (10 mg/day) for >1 year inhibited the concentration of plasma CA increase and prevented syncope in all 12 patients (p < 0.05); however, placebo had no effect on plasma CA concentrations and syncope disappeared in only two of 12 patients after administration of placebo. From this study, we conclude that enalapril can prevent NMS in patients, presumably because of its part in the inhibition of CA release from sympathetic nerve endings.", 
    "79": "Bradykinin is a substrate for both neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Our previous studies showed that ACE inhibitors can stimulate nitric oxide production in coronary microvessels, which is mediated by local kinins. Whether inhibition of NEP also can affect local vascular NO production has not been established. To determine the role of NEP in the control of NO production, coronary microvessels were isolated from seven mongrel dogs. Two NEP inhibitors, phosphoramidon and thiorphan, and an ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat, were used. Nitrite, the metabolite of NO in aqueous solution, was measured by using the Griess reaction. Phosphoramidon and thiorphan (10(-6) M) increased nitrite production from 80 +/- 6 to 136 +/- 6 and 144 +/- 7 pmol/mg, respectively. Ramiprilat (10(-8) M) increased nitrite production from 78 +/- 6 to 155 +/- 7 pmol/mg wet weight. The effect of these agents on nitrite release was blocked by L-NAME, which inhibits NO synthase, HOE-140, which blocks bradykinin B2-receptor, and dichloroisocoumarin, which blocks kinin-forming enzymes. These results clearly indicate that inhibition of kinin metabolism by using neutral endopeptidase inhibitors increases NO production from coronary microvessels. Thus neutral endopeptidase plays an important role in local kinin-modulated NO production in the coronary microcirculation and NEP inhibitors may be useful clinical tools in treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "80": "The contribution of nondegraded bradykinin to the metabolic effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-kininase II inhibitor ramipril was evaluated in rats rendered hypertensive, hyperinsulinemic, and hypertriglyceridemic by a fructose-enriched diet. The response of blood pressure, insulin, and triglyceride levels to concomitant administration of ramipril and the bradykinin antagonist HOE 140 was studied. Rats that received ramipril, HOE 140, or not treated at all served as controls. Treatment with ramipril reduced levels of both insulin (from 6.6 +/- 2.0 to 3.6 +/- 1.7 ng/ml; p < 0.05) and triglycerides (from 292 +/- 88 to 164 +/- 35 mg/dl; p < 0.001) as well as blood pressure (from 144 +/- 6 to 116 +/- 6 mm Hg; p < 0.001). In contrast, treatment with HOE 140 did not alter any of these parameters. The combined treatment, however, blunted the beneficial metabolic effects of ramipril on insulin (7.8 +/- 4.4 ng/ml before and 7.7 +/- 2.9 ng/ml after treatment) and triglycerides (290 +/- 135 mg/dl before and 285 +/- 152 mg/dl after treatment), whereas the hypotensive effect of ramipril was preserved (151 +/- 8 mm Hg before and 122 +/- 6 mm Hg after treatment (p < 0.001). The data suggest that whereas the hypotensive effect is mostly angiotensin-II dependent, the advantageous metabolic affect of ramipril is highly dependent on the accumulation of bradykinin.", 
    "81": "This study was carried out to characterize a novel angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, TA-606, (3-pentyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl-5-acetyl-2-n-propyl-3-[2'(1H-tetrazole-5-yl) biphenyl-4-yl]methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro imidazo [4,5-c] pyridine-4-carboxylate hydrochloride, which is a newly synthesized prodrug of 606A. In anesthetized rats, 606A inhibited angiotensin II-induced pressor response with a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6 microg/kg, i.v., and was 8 times more potent than EXP3174, an active metabolite of losartan. Bioavailability of TA-606 was 11 times higher than that of 606A in Sprague-Dawley rats, with consistent hypotensive potencies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In conscious renal hypertensive rats (RHRs) and conscious SHRs, TA-606 lowered the blood pressure without any effects on the heart rate, and its effective dose for 30 mm Hg (ED30) values were 0.14 and 0.21 mg/kg, p.o., respectively. The effect of TA-606 lasted > 10 h in both models. Moreover, the effect of TA-606 was approximately 30 and 10 times more potent than those of losartan in RHRs and SHRs, respectively. TA-606 did not affect the blood pressure in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. TA-606 given for 12 weeks attenuated the development of hypertension in stroke-prone SHRs. These results indicate that TA-606 is a potent angiotensin II-receptor antagonist with antihypertensive efficacy. Thus TA-606 is suggested to be a possible useful agent in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "82": "The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, on the development of atherosclerosis was determined in the apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient mice. These mice develop severe hypercholesterolemia and extensive atherosclerotic lesions on chow diet, similar to those found in humans. Furthermore, in these mice, accelerated atherosclerosis is associated with increased plasma lipid peroxidation, a phenomenon that may play a crucial role in the buildup of the atherosclerotic lesions. Mice received either placebo or 50 mg/kg/day of captopril. After 12 weeks of treatment, captopril reduced the aortic-lesion area by 70% compared with that of the placebo-treated group. Captopril also increased the resistance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to CuSO4-induced oxidative stress, as shown by a significant reduction in the LDL content of malondialdehyde (MDA) by 30%, as well as by the prolongation of the lag time required for LDL oxidation from 55 min in the placebo-treated mice to 70 min in the captopril-treated mice, and reduction of the maximum LDL oxidation at 150 min by 35%. In vitro studies demonstrated that preincubation of LDL with captopril, inhibited the onset of CuSO4-induced LDL peroxidation up to 120 min, and reduced the LDL content of MDA by 90%. We conclude that captopril attenuates atherosclerosis in the apo E-deficient mice, and this phenomenon may be related to its inhibitory effect on the plasma LDL oxidation.", 
    "83": "Osteopontin is a bone protein also expressed in other tissues. Increased osteopontin is thought to be associated with tissue inflammation. We used immunocytochemical analyses and polymerase chain reaction amplification of mRNA to examine osteopontin expression and regulation in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in rats, a model of inflammatory kidney disease. In the obstructed kidney, osteopontin mRNA and protein were significantly increased. The increase reached 4-fold after 1 day of UUO and persisted at this level for the 5-day duration of UUO. Immunocytochemical analyses showed increased osteopontin protein in tubular cells of the obstructed kidney cortex from days 1 through 5 of UUO. No such significant increase was apparent in the glomerulus or interstitium. Increased osteopontin mRNA and protein likewise occurred in the tubular cells of the obstructed kidney of rats that had undergone whole-body irradiation to eliminate macrophage infiltration into the experimental kidney. Purified osteopontin was found to be a chemoattractant for macrophages isolated from the rat peritoneum. Enalapril treatment, which decreases macrophage infiltration of the obstructed kidney, had no effect on the increase in osteopontin mRNA but significantly attenuated the increase in protein in tubular cells. Western blot analysis of whole cortical homogenates revealed that the osteopontin antibody recognized one protein of 67 kD. The amount of this protein was substantially decreased in kidney homogenates obtained from enalapril-treated compared to untreated animals. Increased osteopontin synthesis may, therefore, contribute in part to the inflammatory response that characterizes obstructive nephropathy.", 
    "84": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is present in 1-10% of the whole population. From the drugs used in CHF so far only angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrate with hydralazine improved the survival which was caused by beneficial influence of these drugs on neurohormonal factors. There is growing interest in beta-blockers which are believed to stop the progress of CHF. Although the first attempts of using beta-blockers in the treatment of CHF took place in 70-ties, only recent years brought better understanding of mechanisms of their action. The beneficial effect of beta-blockers in CHF is related to their protective influence on myocardium and to hampering of apoptosis--programmed cell death--the phenomenon which is exaggerated in CHF. The investigations carried out in last years proved that carvedilol which is beta 1-, beta 2- and alpha 1-blocker and has antioxidant properties improved clinical status and reduced mortality in the cohorts of patients with all-cause CHF. At present great trials estimating various beta-blockers and comparing these drug among themselves are being conducted.", 
    "85": "Hypertension is an important risk factor for vascular disease. Primary goal of hypertension treatment is to prevent or delay the onset of blood pressure-related morbidity and mortality. It has been well demonstrated that the responses rate to any single class of antihypertensive agent, give as monotherapy is approximately 45% to 55%, and in half of hypertensive population a second will be required. The data from clinical trials clearly demonstrate that two-drug combination, usually with low-dose diuretics with any one of the other first-line agents increases the response rate to about 80% to 85% and reduces the likelihood of adverse events and alteration in lipid, carbohydrate and electrolyte metabolism. Of the various combinations being given that of an diuretic and ACE inhibitor, and ACE inhibitor and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers seems particularly attractive. Some combinations are inappropriate, such as diuretic and calcium channel blockers, and beta-blocker with verapamil and diltiazem. Combination of ACE inhibitor and a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may provide benefit in regression left ventricular hypertrophy diabetic nephropathy, and post myocardial infarction.", 
    "86": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now established drugs in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is complex and acts as a circulating hormonal system, a local endogenous tissue system and neuromodular. Current experimental evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors reduce the risk associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The antiatherogenic action of ACE inhibitors is related to complex effects mediated by these agent, including an antiproliferative and antimitotic action, beneficial effects on endothelial function, plaque-stabilizing effects and the action of these agents on the sympathetic nervous system. The role of ACE inhibitors in preventing the clinical sequale of atherosclerotic cardiac disease has been evaluated in various patient populations. Several small trial assess the effects of ACE inhibitors in severity of angina pectoris have reported conflicting results, with benefit is some patients and no benefit or even exacerbation of angina in others, indicating that ACE inhibitors do not have consistent antianginal effects in short-term study. ACE inhibitors have the theoretical potential to prevent restenosis after PTCA but they do not prevent restenosis and has no effect on overall clinical outcome. New data suggest that ACE inhibitors may be effective therapy fir patients following acute myocardial infarction. The renin-angiotensin system, is activated during new myocardial infarction and has an impact on the process of remodeling of the left ventricle which causes ist dysfunction and heart failure. In most of the large mortality trials the rationale for early treatment with ACE inhibitors after myocardial infarction was stated. ACE inhibitors have a positive effect in preventing the ventricular dilatation and they reduce the rate of reinfarctions and the mortality rate.", 
    "87": "Endothelins (ETs) are peptides of 21 amino acids synthesized and released by variety of cells. Endothelin (now this peptide is called endothelin-1 (ET-1)) was isolated and identified in 1988 by Yanagisawa et al. Following studies revealed two other isoforms of endothelin': Endothelin-2 (ET-2) and endothelin-3 (ET-3). All of them bind to two types of receptors (A and B (ET-A r, ET-Br). ET-A r are responsible for concentration mediating. Two subtypes of ET-B r are known. ET-B1 r mediates vasorelaxation; ET-B2 vasoconstriction. ETs (especially ET-1) have variety of biological actions but the most important are vasoconstrictor and mitogenic action. Through these two mechanism ETs may participate in the pathogenesis and/or in the maintenance of hypertension in both experimental animal models and human essential hypertension. The intravenous infusion of synthetic ET induces a long-lasting elevation of blood pressure in experimental animals and in healthy humans. Number of studies have shown enhanced responses to ET in hypertensive subjects but decreased responses have also been reported. Similarly, plasma levels of ET-1 are either normal or elevated in experimental and human essential hypertension. Numerous investigators have suggested an interaction between ET and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors through the renin-angiotensin system or through the accumulation of endogenous bradykinin. Also calcium antagonists of different classes prevent endothelin-induced contractions. Endothelin- converting enzyme inhibitor (phosphoramidon) and ET-A/B r antagonists (bosentan, BQ-123, FR139317) may have potential role as vasodilators in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "88": "We investigated the effect of a 4-day oral salt load (150 mmol NaCl extra per day) on blood pressure, erythrocyte sodium transport and the activity in the renin-angiotensin system in six males with primary hypertension, who had attained normotension on chronic enalapril treatment for 4 years. The design was a placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way cross over, double-blind study, i.e. each patient served as his own control. Intracellular erythrocyte sodium and potassium content were measured by flame photomometry. The increase in the intracellular sodium concentration during 1 h in 37 degrees C incubation of whole-blood with ouabain (compared with no-ouabain) was measured to determine the rate of active sodium efflux. 24-h blood pressure registration was performed with Space-lab equipment (SL 90202) before and at the end of the salt load. Left ventricular morphology was evaluated with echocardiography and the minimal vascular resistance of the hand vascular bed with water plethysmography at baseline and after 4 years on enalapril. Four years' enalapril treatment caused a significant decrease in blood pressure, left ventricular mass and minimal vascular resistance. During the 4-day salt load average 24-h blood pressure was significantly elevated, 129+/-3/85+/-2 mmHg as compared to 124+/-2/82+/-2 mmHg during placebo treatment (p=0.025). The change (delta) in MAP during high salt intake showed a negative relationship to delta-sodium efflux rate constant (r=-0.65, p=0.047). No significant relationship was found between the blood pressure response to the salt load and structural cardiovascular changes. In conclusion, a short-term oral salt load in hypertensive patients on chronic enalapril treatment caused a blood pressure rise, which was related to cellular sodium transport but not to structural cardiovascular changes.", 
    "89": "Anaphylactoid reactions (AR) have been attributed to the generation of bradykinin (BK) when AN69 membranes are used together with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during hemodialysis. However, conclusive evidence for the involvement of the BK as the mediator of these AR is still lacking. This study examined the degree of contact activation in an animal model caused by three PAN membranes--AN69, PAN DX, and SPAN- and the effects of different doses of the ACE inhibitor enalapril (ENA) and the BK B2-receptor antagonist icatibant on AR during hemodialysis. Six sheep were dialyzed for one hour with or without ENA pre-treatment using the different membranes in random order. Severe AR were observed only during hemodialysis with AN69 dialyzers together with ENA pre-treatment; the severity of AR increased with the ENA dose. Mild hypotension was noted during hemodialysis with AN69 without ACE inhibition and with PAN DX and 20 mg ENA. Compared to pre-dialysis values, maximum generation of BK after blood passage through the dialyzer was found at five minutes: 73-fold (AN69 without ENA), 161-fold (AN69 with 10 mg ENA), 97-fold (AN69 with 20 mg ENA), 108-fold (AN69 with 30 mg ENA), 154-fold (AN69 with 30 mg ENA and 0.1 mg/kg icatibant), 18-fold (PAN DX without ENA), and 42-fold (PAN DX with 20 mg ENA). Elevated BK levels in arterial blood were detected during hemodialysis with AN69 membranes even without ACE inhibition (2.5-fold); pre-treatment with 20 mg ENA further increased arterial BK concentrations (4-fold). Furthermore, a marked decline of prekallikrein and high molecular weight kininogen concentrations was noted for both AN69 and PAN DX membranes. Anaphylactoid reactions during hemodialysis were completely prevented by icatibant even after pre-treatment with ENA and in the presence of high BK concentrations. Concentrations of prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, and BK remained unchanged and no AR were observed during hemodialysis with SPAN and pre-treatment with 20 mg ENA. Our findings confirm that AR during hemodialysis with the negatively charged AN69 membrane are mediated by BK, since they can be prevented by the BK B2-receptor antagonist icatibant.", 
    "90": "The antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients with diabetic nephropathy varies considerably. Therefore, we tested the potential role of an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the ACE gene on this early antiproteinuric responsiveness in an observational follow-up study. Sixty (II, N = 13; ID, N = 26 and DD, N = 21) young hypertensive IDDM patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy were investigated during three months before and for the initial six month period during ACE inhibition [captopril 44 (SD 22) mg/24 hr, no differences in drug dose between groups]. Blood pressure (MABP) and albuminuria (ELISA) were measured three (1 to 6) times before and three (1 to 13) times during ACE inhibition. At baseline the groups (II/ID/DD) had comparable (1) mean arterial blood pressure (MABP mm Hg) of 113 +/- 10/108 +/- 9/114 +/- 8, (2) albuminuria (geometric mean with 95% CI) 1394 (747 to 2608)/1176 (844 to 1797) and 1261 (827 to 2017) mg/24 hr, and (3) serum creatinine (geometric mean with 95% CI), 80 (68 to 93)/85 (76 to 97)/103 (85 to 119) mumol/liter, respectively. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition induced a significant reduction in MABP, albuminuria and kidney function in all three groups (II/ID/DD; P < 0.05): (1) MABP (mean +/- SD) 12 +/- 7/5 +/- 7/8 +/- 9 mm Hg (ANOVA, P = 0.02); (2) albuminuria [mean (95% CI)] 61 (34 to 77)/22 (3 to 37)/31 (13 to 46) %, (ANOVA, P < 0.01); and (3) increasing serum creatinine [mean (95% CI)] 8 (4 to 12)/9 (3 to 16)/8 (0 to 16) % (ANOVA, NS), respectively. Adjusting for differences in reduction in MABP did not change the association between decrease in albuminuria and ACE/ID genotypes (P < 0.01). A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the ACE/ID polymorphism, albuminuria and MABP at baseline independently influenced the decline in albuminuria after initiation of ACE inhibition (R2 = 0.21, P < 0.01). A significant association between changes in MABP and albuminuria was demonstrated (R2 = 0.16, P < 0.01). Our data show that hypertensive albuminuric IDDM patients with the II genotype are particularly susceptible to commonly advocated renoprotective treatment.", 
    "91": "Ischemic nephropathy due to bilateral renovascular disease (RVD) is increasingly recognized as cause of end-stage renal failure in the elderly, but a reliable non-invasive method of detection is nor available. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) may impair renal function in such patients, but a prospective study of its diagnostic validity has not been undertaken. We studied the effects of controlled exposure to ACEi on plasma creatinine in 108 patients at risk for severe bilateral atherosclerotic RVD, and compared the findings with subsequent angiography. ACEi was given for two weeks, or, to avoid acute renal failure, for four days if plasma creatinine had increased by 20% or more. If after two weeks of ACEi plasma creatinine had not increased by > or = 20%, while blood pressure was still elevated, plasma creatinine was remeasured after blood pressure control by addition of diuretics. The severity of RVD was scored by the stenosis grade of the best perfused kidney. Fifty-two patients had severe bilateral RVD, defined as > or = 50% stenosis to both kidneys (N = 23) or a solitary functioning kidney (N = 29). Of the others, 21 had less severe bilateral RVD, 20 unilateral RVD, and 15 no apparent RVD. Basal plasma creatinine was higher in severe bilateral RVD (median 170 mumol/liter, range 85 to 654 mumol/liter) than in the others (122 mumol/liter, 62 to 675 mumol/liter; P < 0.01), but not discriminative due to a large variability. The increase during ACEi was correlated with the degree of RVD (r = 0.53, P < 0.001). In 69 patients ACEi caused at least a 20% increase in plasma creatinine, in 26 cases by four days, in 31 after two weeks, and in 12 only after blood pressure control by diuretics. Among these were all 52 patients with severe bilateral RVD, 15 of the 41 patients with lesser forms of RVD, and two with normal renal arteries. Thus, in this selected population the criterion of > or = 20% rise in plasma creatinine upon ACEi was 100% sensitive to detect severe bilateral RVD, while its specificity was 70%. No case of acute renal failure was encountered, and plasma creatinine always recovered after stopping ACEi. In conclusion, controlled exposure to ACEi in these patients is safe, and ACEi-induced increase in plasma creatinine is a very sensitive detector of severe bilateral RVD in a high risk population.", 
    "92": "The relationship between (excessive) use of sodium chloride and the blood pressure is still equivocal. Blood pressure responses to alterations in dietary salt consumption vary greatly between individuals, which has led to the concept of salt sensitivity. Although the mechanisms which determine the degree of salt sensitivity are not fully understood, the renin-angiotensin system seems to play a key role. A relative inability of this system to respond promptly to alterations in salt intake may underlie the development of salt sensitivity. By administering drugs which block the renin-angiotensin system to patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure is rendered more sensitive to the effects of salt restriction and (or) diuretic treatment.", 
    "93": "The results of meta-analyses and of the recent 'modification of diet in renal disease' study show that dietary protein restriction slows down deterioration of renal function in patients with a moderately impaired renal function. However, this effect appears to be less pronounced than previously assumed. Protein restriction probably leads to narrowing of the preglomerular blood vessel, which reduces the raised intraglomerular pressure. The resulting decrease in the filtering glomerular pressure initially leads to a slight loss of renal function, but there after to a decelerated deterioration of renal function. The aim should be a protein intake of 0.6-0.75 g per kg per day. Dietary compliance should not be predicted anamnestically but should be calculated according to the (modified) Maroni equation (protein intake = (0.18 x urinary urea excretion in mmol per 24 hours) + 15 + urinary protein excretion in g per 24 hours). This kind of protein restriction as a rule does not lead to nutritional deficiencies.", 
    "94": "In non-diabetic subjects, an attenuated systemic norepinephrine (NE) responsiveness may contribute to the mechanisms of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment.

    "95": "In seven microalbuminuric IDDM patients, systemic and renal responsiveness to NE, infused at individually determined threshold [deltamean arterial pressure (MAP)=0 mmHg], 20% pressor (deltaMAP=4 mmHg) and pressor (deltaMAP=20 mmHg) doses, were compared before and after 8 weeks treatment with enalapril, 10 mg daily. Blood glucose was clamped at 5 mmol/l and insulin was infused at 30 mU/kg/h.", 
    "96": "Enalapril decreased MAP (P<0.05) and microalbuminuria (P<0.05), whereas effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased (P<0.01) and glomerular filtration rate remained unaltered. The filtration fraction tended to decline (P=0.09). The ACE inhibitor-induced fall in MAP disappeared at NE pressor dose, and the overall mean increase in MAP in response to NE was even higher with than without enalapril (P<0.05). After enalapril, the ERPF remained higher at all NE doses (P<0.05), but the magnitude of the NE-induced fall in ERPF was not altered by ACE inhibition treatment. Overnight urinary albumin excretion fell with ACE inhibition (P<0.05), but this effect was not seen during NE infusion. The angiotensin II/active renin ratio and serum aldosterone levels remained lower with enalapril at all NE doses (P<0.05).", 
    "97": "Enalapril does not attenuate systemic and renal vascular responsiveness to exogenous NE in microalbuminuric IDDM despite adequate inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These findings suggest that the effect of NE on vasoconstriction is not counteracted effectively by ACE inhibition treatment alone.",

They comprised a total of 1715 patients in 13 placebo (n=165, age: 50+/-3 years) and 89 active treatment arms (n=1550, age: 56+/-10 years) respectively. Overall, for active treatment left ventricular mass index was the more reduced the greater the decrease in systolic blood pressure, (r=0.27; P<0.05), the longer the duration of therapy (r=0.36; P<0.001), and the higher the pretreatment value of left ventricular mass index (r= 0.53; P<0.001). Left ventricular mass index was decreased by 12% with ACE-inhibitors (95% CI: 9.0-14.5%), by 11% with calcium channel blockers (95% CI: 7.8-13.7%), by 5% with beta-blockers (95% CI: 1.2-7.3%) and by 8% with diuretics (95% CI: 3.9-11.1%) (overall P<0.01). Subsequent tests revealed that ACE-inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were more effective than beta-blockers in reducing left ventricular mass index (P<0.05). Similar differences between drug classes were found with regard to effect on left ventricular wall thickness (P<0.05).",

    "104": "Neurohumoral activation refers to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide. It is now known that neurohumoral activation contributes to the transition from ventricular dysfunction to clinical heart failure, and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in heart failure. Although the treatment of heart failure has traditionally focused on drugs to improve ventricular function, there is increasing evidence that therapeutic modulation of neurohumoral activation is a key to successful treatment of heart failure. For example, there is mounting evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (the unquestioned cornerstone for treatment of heart failure), beta receptor blockers, digitalis, and endurance exercise training exert their benefit in heart failure in large part through neurohumoral modulation. This observation--discussed in this brief review--highlights the concept that compensatory neurohumoral activation to decreased cardiac function may itself contribute to the development of heart failure and its poor prognosis.", 
    "105": "The contents of [Met5]-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 (met-enk-RF) and its six hydrolysis products: Y, YG, YGG, YGGF, YGGFM, and YGGFMR were estimated after incubating met-enk-RF with either a guinea-pig ileal or striatal membrane fraction for various times at 37 degrees C. After 45 min incubation with either ileal or striatal membranes, met-enk-RF was completely hydrolyzed, yielding Y as the major product. Incubation with either membrane preparation for 60 min in the presence of the aminopeptidase inhibitor amastatin hydrolyzed 90 or 92% of met-enk-RF, respectively, with YGG being the major product. If the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I inhibitor captopril is also included in the incubation, met-enk-RF hydrolysis decreases by about half for both membranes, with YGG remaining the major product. Inclusion of three peptidase inhibitors, amastatin, captopril, and phosphoramidon (inhibition of endopeptidase-24.11) further reduced met-enk-hydrolysis, with 87% or more remaining intact. This shows that met-enk-RF was mainly hydrolyzed by three enzymes, amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, captopril-sensitive dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I and phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11, in both ileal and striatal membranes. Additionally, estimations of [Leu5]-enkephalin (leu-enk), alpha- and beta-neoendorphins (alpha- and beta-neoends), and dynorphin B (dyn B) contents after incubating the individual peptides with striatal membrane for 60 min in the presence of the three peptidase inhibitors showed that 98, 32, 5, and 23%, respectively, remained intact. Our previous studies together with the data obtained here show that one group of endogenous opioid peptides: met-enk, leu-enk, met-enk-RF, met-enk-RGL, and dyn A-(1-8) are largely or almost exclusively hydrolyzed by the three enzymes, amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, captopril-sensitive dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I, and phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11, and indicate that an unidentified fourth enzyme(s) is involved in the hydrolysis of another group of peptides: alpha-neoend, beta-neoend, and dyn B.", 
    "106": "Arterial compliance, defined as a change in dimension in response to a given change in stress, is becoming an increasingly important clinical parameter. Related concepts, such as distensibility, elasticity, and stiffness, and more traditional concepts such as resistance, afterload, and impedance need to be differentiated from compliance, although they are frequently (inappropriately) used interchangably. Many studies cannot differentiate between compliance changes due to a drug's effect on blood pressure and those due to a drug's effect on vessel wall integrity. This differentiation is important because a more physiologic therapy, one that benefits pulsatile and nonpulsatile flow, should be of greater clinical benefit than a therapy that only lowers blood pressure. A number of methods have been used to estimate compliance, but to date there is no generally agreed-on best method. There also are no longitudinal studies that relate abnormal compliance and drug effects to outcome. Nonetheless, patients at risk from a variety of disease states, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia, may benefit from earlier recognition of abnormal compliance. Earlier recognition may lead to interventions that would reduce their risk. This review includes a discussion of compliance and related estimates of blood vessel function and attempts to summarize the data currently available regarding the effects of cardioactive drugs on arterial compliance.",

The total clearance (Clt), renal clearance (ClT), and nonrenal clearance (ClNR) were significantly lower in Chinese (16.29 +/- 6.92, 6.85 +/- 2.97, and 9.44 +/- 5.08 mL.hr-1.kg-1) than those obtained in whites (29.88 +/- 6.36, 13.55 +/- 3.45, and 16.33 +/- 5.07 mL.hr-1.kg-1). The Chinese subjects had a significantly lower volume of distribution (Vc [volume of distribution of central compartment] and Vdss [volume of distribution at steady state]) (29.38 +/- 21.12 and 73.67 +/- 40.20 mL/kg) than white men (58.14 +/- 15.01 and 152.49 +/- 24.89 mL/kg). The Chinese men also had a shorter elimination half-life than whites, although not statistically significant. The respective half-lives in Chinese and whites were 5.51 +/- 1.53 and 8.24 +/- 1.99 hours. The significant differences in ClNR and ClR may be related to lower liver elimination function and lower kidney excretory function, respectively. Plasma protein binding may contribute to part of the difference in the volume of distribution. Chinese men have smaller volume of distribution and clearances of fosinoprilat after intravenous administration compared with white men. The cumulative urine excretion of fosinoprilat was not different between Chinese and whites. Chinese may require a lower fosinoprilat dosage to obtain plasma concentrations similar to whites after intravenous administration. However, since a relatively high variation was found in fosinopril oral absorption, the oral dosage of fosinopril for Chinese and whites may not be different. Further study is obviously needed to elucidate whether the pharmacodynamic effect may be different between Chinese and whites.", 
    "108": "The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, as monotherapies and in combination, is common in the management of hypertension. Clinical studies have documented the augmentation of blood pressure reduction when these agents are combined compared with the individual agents, in short-term studies. In the present investigation, 93 patients with stage 3-4 essential hypertension, who successfully completed a short-term double-blind study, participated in a 40-week open-label treatment phase. The patients were maintained on their previous doses of enalapril/diltiazem ER (E/D) with or without additional antihypertensive medications. Doses of medication could be adjusted as necessary for blood pressure control. Of the 93 patients, 68% were male and 82% were white; they averaged 52.7 years of age and had a baseline mean sitting blood pressure (SiBP) of 167/111 mmHg. The use of E/D alone (n = 14) reduced mean SiBP by 14.5/14.4 mmHg from baseline, whereas the use of E/ D with other agents (n = 79) decreased it by 27/20.5 mmHg from baseline. E/D alone or in combination with other drugs was well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events were noted. This long-term open-label study demonstrated that the E/D combination alone or with the addition of other antihypertensive drugs was effective, safe, and well-tolerated after prolonged administration.",

Patients treated with theophylline showed a significant reduction of Hct values causing a reduction of erythropoietin serum level in 8/13 patients. Lisinopril and theophylline administered in combination presented a significant decrease of Hct values, while EPO values diminished compared to basal values.",

    "115": "This report establishes the presence of mammalian-like proopiomelanocotropic hormone (POMC), and six of its peptides, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), in the immune tissues of the leech Theromyzon tessulatum. The 25.4-kDa protein was purified by high pressure gel permeation chromatography, anti-ACTH-affinity column, and reverse-phase HPLC. Its characterization was performed by Edman degradation, enzymatic treatments, and electrospray mass spectrometry. Leech POMC exhibits considerable amino acid sequence similarity to mammalian POMC. Of the six peptides, three showed high sequence similarity to their vertebrate counterparts met-enkephalin, alpha-MSH, and ACTH: 100, 84.6, and 70%, respectively; whereas gamma-MSH, beta-endorphin, and gamma-lipotropin hormone exhibited only 45, 20, and 10% sequence identity, respectively. No dibasic amino acid residues were found at the C terminus of the gamma- and beta-MSH peptides. In contrast, the leech alpha-MSH was flanked at its C-terminal by the Gly-Arg-Lys amidation signal. ACTH and corticotropin-like intermediary pituitary peptide were also C-terminally flanked by dibasic amino acid residues. The coding region of leech POMC was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using degenerated oligonucleotide primers. Circulating levels of ACTH and MSH were 10 and 1 fmol/microl hemolymph, respectively. Morphine, in a dose-dependent manner, increased the levels of both peptides threefold; this effect was blocked by naloxone treatment. Similar results were found with the anandamide. Leech ACTH was processed to MSH by the enzymes neutral endopeptidase (24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Leech alpha-MSH had the same activity as authentic alpha-MSH in two bioasssay systems. Taken together, the study demonstrates that POMC is present in invertebrates and its immunoregulatory actions have been conserved during evolution.", 
    "116": "Several studies document an underuse of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in heart failure (HF) patients, despite their proven efficacy and good tolerability. Also, there is some evidence that the doses used in clinical practice are far lower than those used in clinical trials.", 
    "117": "To identify patterns of ACEI use in HF patients this study examined data collected on admission day regarding demographic, clinical, and medical care characteristics of 355 patients hospitalized because of decompensated HF who were treated with and without ACEIs. Additionally, measures of in-hospital outcome were compared among the two groups. Fifty-eight point six percent of patients were receiving ACEIs at admission and 80.6% were treated with ACEIs during hospitalization. The average ACEI does was low. No differences were observed in age and measures of severity of HF between ACEI-prescribed and nonprescribed patients. Patterns that could explain ACEI underuse included female sex, lower systolic blood pressure, worse renal function, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, use of alternate drugs (eg, spironolactone), and overall less intense medical management. Patterns associated with the use of lower doses of ACEIs included older age, higher New York Heart Association functional class, and lower systolic blood pressure. In-hospital death rates were significantly higher for patients not treated with ACEIs.", 
    "118": "This study suggests that many patients eligible for ACEI treatment were deprived of the advantages of these drugs because of erroneous clinical strategies. Nevertheless, the patterns of ACEI use were similar to those reported by other studies. Clinical trials conducted to determine the risk/benefit ratio of ACEI use in patients with renal dysfunction and the utility of ACEIs in diastolic HF, as well as programs to educate care providers on proper use of ACEIs in HF patients, are strongly recommended.",

The changes in plasma BNP levels in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have not been examined well. This study was designed to examine the effects of early angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy on plasma BNP levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "120": "We measured the plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide over the time course for 2 weeks in 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction in whom either imidapril (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) was given at random immediately after admission. Plasma BNP levels increased and reached a peak of 192 +/- 28 pg/ML 16 hours after administration; thereafter, the levels decreased and then again increased, forming the second peak of 217 +/- 38 pg/ML on the fifth day (biphasic pattern). On the other hand, plasma BNP levels increased and reached a peak level of 190 +/- 22 pg/ML 16 hours after admission and then decreased from 2 days after admission until the second week in the imidapril group (monophasic pattern). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured in the second week was significantly higher in the imidapril group than in the control group (62.2 +/- 1.1% vs 51.2 +/- 3.6%, P < .01).", 
    "121": "It is concluded that plasma BNP levels followed a monophasic pattern after imidapril treatment, whereas a biphasic pattern was followed after placebo, and that plasma BNP levels constitute a marker of ventricular dysfunction in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "122": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of enalapril and nifedipine on renal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) production and on the rate of urinary TGF-beta excretion in rats with subtotal renal ablation. After subtotal nephrectomy some animals were treated with enalapril or nifedipine. Renal cortical TGF-beta mRNA levels were 68% higher in untreated nephrectomized rats (p < 0.05) and 39% higher in rats treated with nifedipine (p < 0.05) compared with controls. There was no difference in renal cortical TGF-beta mRNA content between the nephrectomized rats treated with enalapril and sham animals, showing that enalapril treatment prevented the increase of TGF-beta mRNA in nephrectomized rats. The rate of urinary TGF-beta excretion was 2.2 +/- 0.8 pg/min in sham animals, 61.5 +/- 40.1 pg/min in untreated nephrectomized rats, 9.6 +/- 4.2 pg/min in nephrectomized rats treated with enalapril, and 55.2 +/- 24.46 pg/min in rats treated with nifedipine. The immunohistochemical reaction for TGF-beta in the renal cortex was less intense in the nephrectomized rats treated with enalapril than in the other groups of rats with subtotal renal ablation. These data show that enalapril induces a decrease in renal TGF-beta production and in urinary TGF-beta excretion in rats with subtotal renal ablation, an effect associated with the protective action of this treatment on renal structure and function and suggest that the determination of the rate of urinary TGF-beta could be a useful procedure for the evaluation of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in the remnant kidney model.", 
    "123": "Successful bilateral renal revascularization was performed 24 days after the development of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor-induced bilateral renal artery thrombosis and anuric acute renal failure in a patient with Takayasu's arteritis. Excellent results were obtained after an unusually long ischemic time for a patient with active-phase disease. The outcome suggests that aggressive surgical revascularization can benefit patients with renal failure caused by renal arterial occlusion during the active phase of Takayasu's arteritis.", 
    "124": "Thromboembolic complications such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction are significantly more frequent in patients with arterial hypertension. From the available intervention studies, it appears that pharmacologic treatment of hypertension-at least with diuretics and beta-blockers-may more effectively protect against cerebrovascular as compared to coronary thromboembolic events. Whether other antihypertensive substances provide a more effective protection with respect to cardiac morbidity and mortality is the subject of numerous studies presently underway. These studies will help to answer the question of whether the extent of protection from coronary events during antihypertensive treatment depends on factors beyond blood pressure control. The fibrinolytic system is crucially involved in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events. One determinant of this system is the balance between plasminogen activators (tissue-type plasminogen activator [t-PA]) and inhibitors (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1]). Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that at least some of the drugs used in the treatment of hypertension may alter the activity of the fibrinolytic system. Scarce and controversial data with respect to such an interaction exist with respect to diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium antagonists. In addition, experimental evidence demonstrates that PAI-1 is stimulated by angiotensin II (A II), whereas t-PA is activated by bradykinin. Thus, antihypertensive drugs acting within the renin angiotensin system should exert effects also within the fibrinolytic system. However, results from clinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and A II receptor antagonists do not unequivocally support such a concept. The discrepancy in the results may, at least in part, be explained by studies performed in healthy volunteer subjects showing that ACE inhibition profoundly affected fibrinolysis only during stimulation of the renin angiotensin system by NaCL restriction.", 
    "125": "Combined inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) produces cardiovascular effects greater than those elicited by selective inhibition of either enzyme alone. Dual metalloprotease inhibitors are single molecules that inhibit both NEP and ACE and produce cardiovascular effects in animal models similar to those elicited by the combination of NEP and ACE inhibitors. The purpose of this study was to determined the duration of antihypertensive activity of the dual metalloprotease inhibitor omapatrilat in rodent models of hypertension. Omapatrilat inhibited NEP (Ki = 9 nmol/L) and ACE (Ki = 6 nmol/L) activities in vitro and inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I in rats after intravenous administration with a potency and duration of action similar to those of the long acting ACE inhibitor fosinoprilat. After single dose administration, omapatrilat lowered mean arterial blood pressure (aortic catheter) in sodium depleted spontaneously hypertensive rats (high renin model) from 148+/-5 to 106+/-3 mm Hg (baseline to 24 h), in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats (low renin) from 167+/-4 to 141+/-5 mm Hg and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (normal renin) from 162+/-4 to 138+/-3 mm Hg (P < .05 at 24 h v vehicle in all models). After oral administration, omapatrilat (100 micromol/kg/day) persistently lowered systolic blood pressure (tail cuff) in spontaneously hypertensive rats during 11 days of treatment; at 24 h after dosing on day 12, mean arterial pressure (aortic catheter) was lower (P < .05) in the group receiving omapatrilat (133+/-5 mm Hg) than in the group receiving vehicle (149+/-2 mm Hg). The results indicate that omapatrilat is a potent dual metalloprotease inhibitor of NEP and ACE with long lasting, oral antihypertensive effects in low, normal, and high renin models of hypertension. Omapatrilat has the potential to be an effective, broad spectrum antihypertensive agent.", 
    "126": "The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a calcium antagonist has become a common way of treating patients with essential hypertension who respond insufficiently to monotherapy. This double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicenter, outpatient study evaluated the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a calcium antagonist (verapamil SR) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril) in patients with mild-to-moderate (stages I and II) essential hypertension. Six hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled in this 10-week study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo phase, patients received one of the following daily dosage regimens in a double-blind fashion for 6 weeks: placebo, 4 mg of trandolapril, 240 mg of verapamil SR, or a combination of 4 mg of trandolapril and 240 mg of verapamil SR. Trough sitting diastolic blood pressure was lowered by 4.5 mm Hg, 4.3 mm Hg, and 8.1 mm Hg more than placebo in the trandolapril, verapamil SR, and combination groups, respectively. In the combination group, sitting diastolic blood pressure was significantly lowered (P < .01) by 3.6 mm Hg more than in the trandolapril group and by 3.8 mm Hg more than in the verapamil SR group. An analysis of the trough-to-peak ratio for sitting diastolic blood pressure revealed values of 0.75 and 0.67, for the 4-mg trandolapril and the combination groups, respectively, at end point. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar for all treatment groups. In this study the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium antagonist was well tolerated and more effective than either agent administered alone for the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "127": "The objective of this study was to test the relationship between neurologic and microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It was hypothesized that the mechanisms operative in autonomic dysfunction seen in diabetic patients with microangiopathy play a role in the rapidity of progression to renal failure. Twenty-six type 1 diabetic patients with proteinuria were studied with computerized monitoring of heart rate variation during timed ventilation, assumption of upright posture, and Valsalva maneuver and with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at baseline. Renal function was evaluated over the ensuing 12 months of intensive insulin therapy. Blood pressure was treated so as to achieve consistent 24-h readings < 140/90 mm Hg. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were the preferred antihypertensive agents. Serial serum creatinine concentrations were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Over 12 months there were no significant serum creatinine changes for any autonomic test group with normal results at baseline. Groups with abnormal autonomic results at baseline demonstrated statistically significant increases in serum creatinine over 12 months compared to their baseline. Of the tests, Valsalva separated groups of patients with similar degrees of baseline renal impairment. Each of the sympathetic plus Valsalva combinations demonstrated a significant difference in progression of serum creatinine increase over 12 months. In each instance, if both sympathetic and Valsalva results were abnormal, there was a statistically significant increase in serum creatinine over 12 months when compared to groups in which one or both test results were normal. There is a relationship between autonomic function and the progression of renal dysfunction. The inability to vary the heart rate to a Valsalva maneuver identifies a degree of parasympathetic dysfunction that permits unopposed sympathetic tone, heralding more rapid renal destruction. A simple inexpensive bedside laboratory test discerned a relatively low-risk group of diabetic patients with proteinuria that demonstrated no deterioration in renal function over 12 months. When the Valsalva maneuver was markedly abnormal the presence of a mean arterial pressure > 100 mm Hg was associated with a greater likelihood of rapid renal deterioration. This group at higher risk of renal deterioration should undergo aggressive lowering of mean arterial blood pressure to < 95 mm Hg.", 
    "128": "The antihypertensive effects of four different antihypertensive medications (beta-blocking agent, atenolol 50 mg; calcium-antagonist, isradipine SRO [slow release] 2.5 mg; diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ] 25 mg; and angiotension converting enzyme-inhibitor, spirapril 6 mg) on obese patients with sleep disordered breathing and hypertension were compared by the ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM). Eighteen patients were randomized in a double-blind, crossover fashion to receive each of the four different medications for 8 weeks. ABPM was performed at baseline and after an 8-week treatment with these medications. A 2- to 3-week washout period occurred both at baseline and between each of the four medications. Three patients were omitted from statistical analysis because of technical problems of ABPM. Atenolol, isradipine SRO, and spirapril decreased significantly (P < .01) the mean 24-h systolic blood pressure, whereas HCTZ did not. The mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after all four medications: 12 (SD+/-14) mm Hg with atenolol, 7 (SD+/-10) mm Hg with isradipine SRO, 3 mm Hg (SD+/-14) with HCTZ, and 6 (SD+/-15) mm Hg with spirapril (P < .01). During nighttime none of the medications reduced the mean diastolic or systolic blood pressure significantly. According to the 24-h blood pressure curve the influence of these four medications during the whole measurement period was not similar. Atenolol and spirapril lost their antihypertensive effect during the early morning hours. The antihypertensive effect of HCTZ varied markedly from hour to hour. The trough-to-peak ratio of no medication was >0.50. Negative correlation was observed between the apnea time and the mean systolic 24-h (r = -0.604, P = NS) and the mean systolic nocturnal blood pressure change (r = -0.590, P = NS). Our study revealed that the daytime high blood pressure was quite easily controlled by the ordinary monotherapy in these patients with partial upper airway obstruction and hypertension. Instead none of the medications used decreased nocturnal high blood pressure markedly.", 
    "129": "The combination of captopril and indomethacin has been shown to control nephrotic proteinuria in an infant with congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. We report the satisfactory control of congenital nephrotic syndrome by enalapril, maintaining normal serum albumin levels without albumin infusions. The haplotype data of our patient were consistent with the diagnosis of a Finnish-type nephrotic syndrome. After 21 months, during which daily infusions of albumin allowed partial control of the symptoms, captopril treatment was started. No adverse effects were noted. Serum creatinine levels remained normal. Within 8 weeks, albumin infusions were completely stopped. After 1 month the treatment was changed to a single dose of enalapril (0.8 mg/kg per day). During the next 15 months, the serum protein concentration was maintained around 6.5-7 g/dl, although proteinuria persisted (0.3-0.5 g/day). Weight and length gain are now satisfactory. We conclude that enalapril may be safely used in infants with severe forms of congenital nephrotic syndrome and might allow the avoidance of aggressive treatments for prolonged periods.", 
    "130": "An abnormality of the physical properties of the cell membrane may underlie the defect that unites the clinical and biochemical abnormalities found in subjects with diabetic nephropathy. The cell membrane is linked both structurally and functionally with the cytoskeleton. The fluorescence anisotropy, a measure of membrane fluidity, was studied at baseline and after modulation of cytoskeletal proteins by thiol group alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was used to assess anisotropy in the deep hydrophobic regions of the lipid bilayer and trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH) was used to assess the superficial, relatively hydrophilic regions. We compared 17 subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and nephropathy with 17 control subjects with IDDM and 24 non-diabetic control subjects. Median TMA-DPH anisotropy (0.271 (0.239-0.332) vs 0.269 (0.258-0.281) vs 0.275 (0.246-0.287)) and DPH anisotropy (0.221 (0.193-0.261) vs 0.227 (0.197-0.253) vs 0.226 (0.193-0.245)) were similar in erythrocytes from the three groups. However after alkylation of protein thiol groups with NEM clear differences emerged. In the control subjects with and without IDDM there was a significant fall in TMA-DPH anisotropy compared to the subjects with diabetic nephropathy in whom the addition of NEM had no effect (deltaTMA-DPH anisotropy -0.005 (-0.020 - +0.006) vs -0.005 (-0.011 - +0.016) vs +0.002 (-0.010 - +0.008) p < 0.001). This finding was confirmed when the deep regions of the lipid bilayer were assessed using DPH (deltaDPH anisotropy -0.017 (-0.029 - -0.007.) vs -0.015 (-0.029 - +0.001) vs + 0.003 (-0.021 - +0.018) p < 0.001). We conclude that cytoskeletal modulation of the physical properties of the cell membrane lipids by proteins is abnormal in subjects with diabetic nephropathy. Such an abnormality could explain some of the clinical and metabolic abnormalities found in this condition.", 
    "131": "The circulation is controlled by overlapping haemodynamic, structural and neurohumoral mechanisms. Many hormonal vasoactive substances, mostly derived from endothelial cells, are also growth regulators. Although neurohormonal systems are involved in normal physiological compensatory responses they often become maladaptive in conditions such as congestive heart failure. The success of blocking the renin angiotensin system by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has led to efforts to block other hormonal systems. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), the major enzymatic pathway for degradation of natriuretic peptides, has a similar catalytic site to ACE. This has led to compounds that simultaneously inhibit both enzymes. Such dual ACE/NEP inhibitors show promise in experimental hypertension and heart failure. Similar dual NEP/ECE (endothelin converting enzyme) inhibitors are becoming available. The hormone vasopressin has dual actions on the vasculature and the kidney via specific membrane receptors. Specific orally active vasopressin receptor antagonists have been developed and their therapeutic potential in hypertension, heart failure and oedematous states are being explored.",

Several studies in hypertensive patients have now shown that treatment with some ACE inhibitors (cilazapril and perindopril) or extended release calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine GITS) induces similar effects in small arteries obtained from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies: both structure and endothelium-dependent relaxation improve under treatment. In contrast, hypertensive patients with equally well-controlled blood pressure but treated with the beta blocker atenolol did not in any of three studies exhibit any improvement in the structure of small arteries or in endothelial function.",

Isoproterenol induced significant increases of echocardiographically measured left ventricular end-diastolic posterior wall thickness and dimension, whereas ramipril treatment significantly attenuated these changes. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was markedly increased in isoproterenol-treated rats and normalized following ramipril. Isoproterenol rats were further characterized by hormonal activations including transient elevations of plasma renin activity, aldosterone and cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme activity. Histomorphological characterization of isoproterenol-treated hearts demonstrated cardiomyocyte necrosis and reparative fibrosis. Ramipril treatment only slightly reduced the amount of necrosis as well as the expression of extracellular matrix proteins.",

Ramipril administration following isoproterenol was highly effective to attenuate hemodynamic and hormonal alterations as well as the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, but had only little influence on the expression of extracellular matrix proteins. Since angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition had no impact on the initial myocardial injury, the development of heart failure in this model seems to require functional integrity of the renin-angiotensin system.",

The most common reason was an ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases, all of whom required inpatient treatment. The medical management consisted of the administration of intravenous (i.v.) glucocorticosteroids in all cases, H1-blockers in 6 cases, epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i.v. epinephrine in another case.

Thus, in the present study, we used the cumulative incidence of progression to albuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] > 200 micrograms/min) from MA as the primary endpoint and the yearly increase in AER at a rate of 50% above baseline as the secondary end-point of renal function.", 
    "145": "Ninety-two normotensive IDDM patients underwent double-blind, double-dummy treatment with either lisinopril or slow-release nifedipine in comparison with placebo. Ten patients discontinued the study during the 3-year follow-up period.",

Time-to-event analysis indicated a reduction in the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria of 58.1% (95% CI 27.8-68.4%) in the 32 patients on lisinopril (P < 0.02) and of 62.5% (95% CI 32.5-73.4%) in the 26 patients on nifedipine (P < 0.02) after adjustment for mean blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, and baseline AER in comparison with the 34 patients on placebo. Baseline AER was 71 micrograms/min (range: 20.7-187.3) in progressors and 73 micrograms/min (range: 20.2-174.1) in nonprogressors (NS). The percentage of patients who showed a > 50% yearly increase of AER above baseline values was significantly lower in the lisinopril group (13 of 32, 40.6%, P < 0.02), but not in the nifedipine group (15 of 26, 57.7%), than in the placebo group (23 of 34, 67.6%). The lisinopril group had significantly lower blood pressure values during follow-up than either the nifedipine (P < 0.05) or the placebo (P < 0.01) group.", 
    "147": "Our data show that both lisinopril and nifedipine are effective in delaying the occurrence of macroalbuminuria in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. As overt proteinuria strongly predicts end-stage renal failure, both treatments appear capable of preventing such a complication in normotensive IDDM patients with MA. However, lisinopril appears more powerful in slowing the course of nephropathy.", 
    "148": "The length density (Lv) of capillaries is known to be increased in the hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after high-dosed but also after low-dosed subantihypertensive treatment with the ACE-inhibitor Ramipril administered in utero and post partum. Under the same conditions in the present study only high-dose Zabicipril caused an increase of capillary Lv. Under preventive ACE-inhibition in both high-dose groups Lv of myocardial arteries was significantly higher. In the low-dose groups Lv was not significantly increased. The increased arterial Lv in the high-dose-group may result from the avoidance of angiotensin II-induced overabundant growth of myocardial muscle-mass. Changes in collagen could not be found in any of the experimental groups.", 
    "149": "Sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmic events is the major cause of mortality among early post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients, accounting for > 250,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Antiarrhythmic drugs can be used in such patients as well as in those who have not had a recent MI but are at high risk for sudden cardiac death (e.g., those with ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, or who have survived cardiac arrest). Most antiarrhythmic drugs available, however, have limitations arising from their toxic and proarrhythmic potential. Thus, research and development of new agents and treatment modalities are desirable. This article seeks to enumerate the lessons of past clinical trials with these agents and to provide guidelines for future trials. That a variety of antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with an increased mortality has been a disturbing observation. It is therefore imperative that candidates for antiarrhythmic therapy be selected appropriately. We recommend that future clinical trials use stringent criteria for the identification of patients at \"high risk\" for arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death, and limit recruitment to such patients. Traditional markers, such as the increased frequency and complexity of ventricular premature beats, and low left ventricular ejection fraction, have not been successful in identifying these high-risk patients. However, decreased heart rate variability and cardiac late potentials recorded on a signal-over-aged electrocardiogram appear to be more specific markers of post-MI arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death and may, in conjunction with the traditional markers, be used to improve selection of trial populations. Since the risk of sudden cardiac death diminishes with time after MI, it is also recommended that the temporal window of treatment with antiarrhythmic agents be limited to 1 year post-MI. It is also important to define clearly the endpoints of efficacy evaluations. A short-term reduction on markers like ventricular ectopic beats, for example, does not translate into a long-term decrease in arrhythmia-related mortality. Therefore, a reduction in overall mortality is the only meaningful endpoint to define the true risk-benefit ratio. To limit exposure to the potentially adverse effects of these agents, target populations for prophylactic antiarrhythmic drugs should be limited to recent post-MI patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia. Avoiding exposure of low-risk patients to antiarrhythmic drugs is equally imperative. \"Low risk\" of all-cause mortality includes the group of post-MI patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction >36%. Risk must be continuously evaluated in the setting of other pharmacologic (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, aspirin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [\"statins\"], and others) and/or nonpharmacologic interventions (coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, implantable cardioverter/defibrillator). There is also a need to improve noninvasive techniques for identifying patients in the high-risk category-at present, the presence of ventricular premature beats and a left ventricular ejection fraction <36% is considered somewhat predictive of sudden cardiac death. Thus, patients with a recent MI and moderately low left ventricular ejection fraction (< or = 36% but not <20%) may be considered for antiarrhythmic therapy. A subset analysis of patients with low heart rate variability can provide valuable additional information. It is important to note that although all-cause mortality is a valid endpoint for such trials, stratification by specific cause of mortality is desirable.", 
    "150": "1. In diabetes mellitus a selective increase in the excretion of albumin generally precedes the occurrence of demonstrable loss of glomerular size-selectivity. However, even in this (microalbuminuric) phase of diabetic nephropathy a defect in glomerular barrier function can be demonstrated during infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide. 2. The aim of this study was to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition could prevent the proteinuric response to atrial natriuretic peptide in these patients. We performed infusions of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.01 microgram min-1 kg-1) in 10 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion 90 +/- 44 mg/day), both before and after 1 month of treatment with enalapril (20 mg once daily). 3. Despite a 40% reduction in proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition did not prevent the atrial natriuretic peptide-induced increase in protein excretion. Both before and during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, atrial natriuretic peptide infusion resulted in a significant increase in the fractional excretion of large dextran molecules, which is compatible with an increase in flow through large unrestrictive 'shunt' pores. Atrial natriuretic peptide infusion also induced an increase in the transcapillary escape rate of albumin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition also failed to prevent this effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on peripheral capillary permeability. 4. We conclude that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition during 1 month does not correct the capillary barrier function defect in patients with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria that is unmasked by atrial natriuretic peptide infusion.", 
    "151": "Effect of chloride and diamide on testicular and epididymal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was investigated using Hip-His-Leu as substrate in sheep. The chloride ions functioned as ACE activators, however, there was no linear correlation between the two. The optimum chloride concentrations were 500 mM for epididymal ACE and 900-1100 mM for testicular ACE. Further, optimum chloride concentration increased ACE activity of testis and epididymis 25.40- folds and 12.84- folds respectively of the activities at physiological chloride concentration. The differences found in the effect of chloride on testicular and epididymal ACE activity suggest dissimilar three dimensional structure of ACE in these tissues. Increased testicular and epididymal ACE activity on diamide pretreatment indicates that tissue oxidation may affect ACE activity.", 
    "152": "We have previously shown that chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) did not reverse hypertrophy of the renal arterial wall in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In this study we determined the effects of perindopril on the functional properties of the renal vasculature in vivo and on its resistance to flow at maximal dilatation in vitro, a measure of vessel lumen diameter. Two groups of SHR were studied: untreated or treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg per day) in their drinking water from 4 weeks of age. At 10 weeks, (1) vessel lumen characteristics were assessed using a maximally dilated in vitro isolated kidney perfusion and (2) the renal vasoconstrictor responses to bolus doses of vasoactive agents (angiotensin II and phenylephrine) administered into the renal artery were measured in vivo (anesthetized rats). Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in conscious SHR treated with perindopril (132+/-2 versus 97+/-2 mm Hg, P<.001). In vitro, the pressure-flow relationship and the pressure-glomerular filtration rate relationship were both shifted significantly to the left (P<.001). The perindopril-treated kidneys began filtering at a significantly lower threshold perfusion pressure than nontreated controls (P<.001). In vivo, renal vasoconstrictor responses to increasing doses of both vasoconstrictor agents were significantly less marked in the perindopril-treated SHR than in untreated SHR (P<.05). Thus, chronic ACEI increased average renal vessel lumen diameter in SHR, predominantly in preglomerular vessels, and reduced renal vasoconstrictor responsiveness in vivo, findings compatible with remodeling of the preglomerular vasculature around a greater lumen.", 
    "153": "Intracellular pH is under strict control in myocardium; H+ are extruded from the cells by sodium-dependent mechanisms, mainly Na+/H+ exchanger and Na+/HCO3- symport, whereas Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger extrudes bases on intracellular alkalinization. Hypertrophic myocardium from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibits increased Na+/H+ exchange activity that is accompanied by enhanced extrusion of bases through Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange. The present experiments were designed to investigate the effect of enalapril-induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy on the activity of these exchangers. Male SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) received enalapril maleate (20 mg/kg per day) in the drinking water for 5 weeks. Gender- and age-matched SHR and WKY were used as untreated controls. Enalapril treatment significantly reduced systolic blood pressure in SHR and completely regressed cardiac hypertrophy. Na+/H+ activity was estimated in terms of both steady pHi value in HEPES buffer and the rate of pHi recovery from CO2-induced acid load. Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- activity was assessed by measuring the rate of pHi recovery from intracellular alkalinization produced by trimethylamine exposure. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy was accompanied by normalization of Na+/H+ and Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with chelerythrine (10 mmol/L) or calphostin C (50 nmol/L) returned both exchange activities to normal values. These results show that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition normalizes the enhanced activity of both exchangers while regressing cardiac hypertrophy. Because normalization of exchange activities could be also achieved by PKC inhibition, the data would suggest that PKC-dependent mechanisms play a significant role in the increased ion exchange activities of hypertrophic myocardium and in their normalization by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "154": "Unexplained, persistent cough limits the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in a significant number of patients. It has been speculated that occurrence of this adverse effect is genetically predetermined; in particular, variants of the genes encoding ACE, chymase, and B2-bradykinin receptor have been implicated. To investigate this question, we determined genotypes for common polymorphisms for these three genes in subjects with a history of ACE inhibitor-related cough. Specificity of the adverse effect was confirmed by a blinded, double-crossover design protocol in which subjects were rechallenged with either lisinopril or placebo. In 99 case subjects and 70 control subjects (who failed to develop cough on rechallenge with ACE inhibitor) thus selected, frequencies for the ACE D and I alleles were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0.56 and 0.44 (controls), respectively; frequencies for chymase A and B alleles (absence/presence of BstXI site) were 0.56 and 0.44 (cases) and 0.46 and 0.54 (controls), respectively; frequencies for B2-bradykinin receptor + and - alleles (presence/absence of a 21 to 29 nonanucleotide sequence) were 0.52 and 0.48 (cases) and 0.53 and 0.47 (controls), respectively. All observed genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence for association between genotype at either gene examined and cough (adjusted for gender and age). Our data indicate that common genetic variants of ACE, chymase, and B2-bradykinin receptor do not explain the occurrence of ACE inhibitor-related cough.", 
    "155": "We used the isolated N- and C-domains of the angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (N-ACE and C-ACE; ACE; kininase II) to investigate the hydrolysis of the active 1-7 derivative of angiotensin (Ang) II and inhibition by 5-S-5-benzamido-4-oxo-6-phenylhexanoyl-L-proline (keto-ACE). Ang-(1-7) is both a substrate and an inhibitor; it is cleaved by N-ACE at approximately one half the rate of bradykinin but negligibly by C-ACE. It inhibits C-ACE, however, at an order of magnitude lower concentration than N-ACE; the IC50 of C-ACE with 100 micromol/L Ang I substrate was 1.2 micromol/L and the Ki was 0.13. While searching for a specific inhibitor of a single active site of ACE, we found that keto-ACE inhibited bradykinin and Ang I hydrolysis by C-ACE in approximately a 38- to 47-times lower concentration than by N-ACE; IC50 values with C-ACE were 0.5 and 0.04 micromol/L. Furthermore, we investigated how Ang-(1-7) acts via bradykinin and the involvement of its B2 receptor. Ang-(1-7) was ineffective directly on the human bradykinin B2 receptor transfected and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, Ang-(1-7) potentiated arachidonic acid release by an ACE-resistant bradykinin analogue (1 micromol/L), acting on the B2 receptor when the cells were cotransfected with cDNAs of both B2 receptor and ACE and the proteins were expressed on the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus like other ACE inhibitors, Ang-(1-7) can potentiate the actions of a ligand of the B2 receptor indirectly by binding to the active site of ACE and independent of blocking ligand hydrolysis. This potentiation of kinins at the receptor level can explain some of the well-documented kininlike actions of Ang-(1-7).",

In order to support the early clinical development (with oral administration and an expected low bioavailability), a sensitive and selective assay was required. An HPLC-atmospheric-pressure chemical ionisation mass-spectrometric (HPLC-APCI-MS-MS) assay had been already validated (R.F. Venn et al., J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal., in press), but due to its low throughput an alternative method was sought. As the molecule is peptide-like and not metabolised, we believed the immunoassay approach was appropriate. Thus we developed an immunoassay for the compound using time-resolved fluorescence as an end-point (DELFIA) with lower limits of quantification of 0.2 ng ml(-1) for the plasma assay and 5 ng ml(-1) for the assay in urine. This assay is a 96-well plate based competitive immunoassay; the end-point is the determination of a (non-radioactive) europium label by time-resolved fluorimetry. Sampatrilat is labelled with chelated europium via isothiocyanate chemistry. The advantage of this assay is its extremely high throughput, allowing rapid analysis of many thousands of samples. The DELFIA method was successfully cross-validated with the HPLC-APCI-MS-MS method.",

Plasma renin activity was significantly increased both by losartan and by enalapril treatments. Neither enalapril nor losartan treatment attenuated atrial natriuretic factor-induced changes in renal haemodynamics. After placebo pretreatment, fractional urinary excretion of sodium increased significantly during infusion of atrial natriuretic factor. Losartan treatment did not influence the increase in urinary excretion of sodium during infusion of atrial natriuretic factor, whereas enalapril treatment significantly attenuated this increase (P < 0.01). Atrial natriuretic factor significantly increased albuminuria. Neither losartan nor enalapril treatment reduced atrial natriuretic factor-induced albuminuria.",

In contrast, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, at a dosage that did not lower blood pressure, did not attenuate the increase in urinary excretion of sodium. These data indicate that atrial natriuretic factor increases natriuresis and diuresis independently of angiotensin II.

    "167": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of interstitial fibrosis alone or associated with hypertrophy on diastolic myocardial function in renovascular hypertensive rats. Myocardial function was evaluated in isolated papillary muscle from renovascular hypertensive Wistar rats (RHT, n = 14), renovascular hypertensive rats treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) ramipril, 20 mg.kg-1.day-1 (RHT RAM, n =14), and age-matched unoperated and untreated Wistar rats (CONT, n = 12). The ACEI treatment for 3 weeks allowed the regression of myocyte mass and the maintenance of interstitial fibrosis. Myocardial passive stiffness was analyzed by the resting tension-length relationship. The myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by measuring myocardial hydroxyproline (Hyp) concentration and by histological studies of the myocardium stained with hematoxylin and eosin or picrosirus red. Left ventricular weight was significantly higher in RHT (0.97 +/- 0.12 g) compared with CONT (0.66 +/- 0.06 g) and RHT RAM (0.69 +/- 0.14 g). The Hyp levels were 2.9 +/- 0.4, 3.4 +/- 0.3, and 3.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/mg of dry tissue for the CONT, RHT, and RHT RAM, respectively. Perivascular and interstitial fibrosis were observed in RHT and RHT RAM groups. There were lymphononuclear inflammatory exudate and edema around arteries, involving adjacent myocytes in the RHT group. There was an increased passive stiffness in RHT and RHT RAM groups compared with the CONT group. In conclusion, our results indicate that the impaired diastolic function in the renovascular hypertensive rats is related to interstitial fibrosis rather than to myocardial hypertrophy.",

Since a beneficial effect of ACE-inhibition on reperfusion injury has been reported, we investigated the impact of cilazaprilat on PMN dependent reperfusion injury in isolated guinea pig hearts.", 
    "169": "Hearts (n = 5 per group) were subjected to 15 min of ischemia. Immediately thereafter, a bolus of PMN was injected into the coronary system. External heart work (EHW) and total cardiac nitric oxide release were measured. For microscopic evaluation, hearts received rhodamine 6G labelled PMN after ischemia, were arrested 5 min later and further perfused with FITC dextran (0.1%). Localization of retained PMN was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Leukocyte activation was studied by FACS analysis of the adhesion molecule CD11b before and after coronary passage of the PMN. The ACE-inhibitor cilazaprilat (Cila, 2 microM) and the NO-synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine (NOLAG, 10 microM) were used to modulate nitric oxide formation of the heart.", 
    "170": "Postischemic EHW recovered to 67 +/- 5% (controls) and 64 +/- 6% (Cila) of the preischemic value. Addition of PMN severely depressed recovery of EHW (39 +/- 2%) and NO release (39 +/- 6% of the preischemic value). Simultaneously, ischemia led to a substantial increase in postcapillary PMN adhesion (from 21 +/- 5 to 172 +/- 27 PMN/mm2 surface) and CD11b-expression of the recovered PMN (3-fold). Cila attenuated postischemic PMN adhesion (83 +/- 52 PMN/mm2) and activation of PMN, whereas it improved recovery of work performance (64 +/- 4%) and NO release (65 +/- 4%) in the presence of PMN. Conversely, NOLAG increased PMN adhesion (284 +/- 40 PMN/mm2) and myocardial injury. We conclude that ACE-inhibition prevents leukocyte dependent reperfusion injury mainly by inhibition of postcapillary leukocyte adhesion. The effect may be mediated by NO, given the proadhesive effect of NOLAG.", 
    "171": "Renin-angiotensin system promotes sodium and chloride retention, participates in the defense response to hypovolemia and, in congestive heart failure, contributes to edema formation and progression of the disease. We investigated whether ACE-inhibitors interfere with the action of the renin-angiotensin system on the nephron, and therefore with water and urinary electrolytes excretion. The interaction among renin-angiotensin system, diuretic treatment and urinary electrolytes was evaluated both during chronic treatment and in response to acute renin-angiotensin system activation as that observed after extracorporeal ultrafiltration-induced transient hypovolemia. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone, body fluid balance and urinary sodium, chloride and potassium concentrations were evaluated in 30 patients with congestive heart failure in NYHA II-III functional class, grouped according to whether long-term therapy did not include (Group I, n = 15) or included (Group II, n = 18) ACE-inhibitors. All parameters were evaluated at baseline and after a single session of extracorporeal ultrafiltration. At baseline, urinary output and urinary sodium and chloride concentrations were similar in the two groups, while urinary potassium concentration was lower in patients assuming ACE-inhibitors (Group II). Plasma renin activity was higher and aldosterone was lower in Group II than in Group I. After removal of similar amounts of plasma water by extracorporeal ultrafiltration, body weight decreased in both groups but the decrease was maintained in the following days only in Group II patients. A transient reduction (48 hours) of both plasma volume and urinary output was observed after ultrafiltration in both groups. Despite plasma renin activity and aldosterone increase, urinary electrolytes response to ultrafiltration was different in the two groups: sodium and chloride were reduced, and potassium did not change in Group 1 while, in Group II, sodium and chloride did not change and potassium excretion was significantly increased. In conclusion, chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors does not enhance the excretion of sodium in congestive heart failure but just mitigates potassium loss. The role of these drugs becomes particularly relevant during acute renin-angiotensin system activation due to hypovolemia; in this setting ACE-inhibitors counteract sodium and chloride retention resulting in a potential hazard due to interference with the defence mechanisms toward hypovolemia, and an amplification of extracorporeal ultrafiltration efficacy by preventing edema recovery after its mechanical removal.",

Furthermore, nocturnal blood pressure elevation (non-dippers) occurs more frequently in patients with nephropathy. Systemic blood pressure elevation, hyperglycaemia, albuminuria and the D polymorphism in the ACE gene accelerate the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Studies of the impact of other potential progression promoters (i.e. smoking, hyperlipidaemia and protein intake) have yielded conflicting results. Effective blood pressure reduction using ACE inhibitors or drugs of other classes, or both, frequently in combination with diuretics reduces albuminuria, delays the progression of nephropathy, postpones renal failure and improves survival in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Antihypertensive treatment for diabetic nephropathy extends life and saves money.",

The primary efficacy variable of phase A will be progression to microalbuminuria. In phase B progression to macro-albuminuria will be evaluated in patients who became microalbuminuric in phase A. These patients will be randomized to 2 years of treatment with trandolapril (2 mg/day) alone or combined with verapamil (180 mg/day).", 
    "178": "ASSOCIATION OF HYPERTENSION AND DIABETES: Diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension are closely related and strongly predispose an individual to atherosclerosis and renal failure. Hypertension is twice as frequent in diabetic individuals as it is in the general population, and often precedes the development of diabetic nephropathy. The prevalence of coexisting arterial hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is increasing because of ageing of the population, allowing an augmented prevalence of atherosclerosis and end-stage diabetic renal disease. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC PATIENTS: The goal of blood pressure control in diabetic patients is to reduce death and disability as much as possible. In addition, other reversible risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which are so frequently seen in hypertensive diabetic individuals, need to be addressed. The optimal blood pressure level in diabetic individuals has not yet been established, but it has been suggested that it be should lower than that recommended by current guidelines. In fact, the literature indicates that 130/85 mmHg should be the systolic/diastolic blood pressure goal in hypertensive diabetic individuals. According to most guidelines the threshold for intervention when multiple associated risk factors coexist with hypertension is a blood pressure level 140/90 mmHg. In diabetic patients therapy has to be instituted early and aggressively. In this regard, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in association with other drugs seem to be the best choice for hypertensive diabetic patients.",

In the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy study ramipril improved survival in patients receiving diuretic treatment but had no effect in patients not receiving diuretics. COMBINATION WITH THERAPY WITH VERAPAMIL AND TRANDOLAPRIL: By combining verapamil with trandolapril we hypothesized that we could obtain an improvement in left ventricular function and prevent cardiac events. In an open study of 14 patients with angina pectoris and left ventricular ejection fraction below 40%, treatment with trandolapril-verapamil significantly improved left ventricular function. In a double-blind randomized study of 100 postinfarct patients with congestive heart failure the cardiac event rate was significantly lower in verapamil-trandolapril-treated than in the trandolapril-treated patients. These results indicate that the combined treatment with verapamil and trandolapril might be beneficial in patients with ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure.",

The significant reduction in mortality in hypertensive individuals persisted after multivariate analysis controlling for a broad spectrum of potential confounders.

Available data indicate that patients who fail to achieve a reduction in LVH are much more likely to suffer cardiovascular events than those in whom LVH is reduced or even normalized using antihypertensive treatment. Reversal of LVH, therefore, represents a major goal in the treatment of hypertensive patients. REGRESSION OF LVH: Since obesity and dietary sodium intake may modulate the degree of LVH, non-pharmacological intervention has achieved a successful reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM). LVM is more closely related to 24-h blood pressure values than to clinical blood pressure values. Recent evidence from the Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation has shown that the regression of cardiac hypertrophy is predicted to a greater degree by the effect of antihypertensive treatment on 24-h average blood pressure than by that on clinic or home blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure variability may also be an independent determinant of cardiovascular target-organ damage, particularly of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the effects of antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure variability can be difficult to determine, mainly because a correct measurement of variability requires a beat-to-beat measurement of ambulatory blood pressure; several measures have been proposed to evaluate the smoothness of blood pressure control during antihypertensive treatment. Other important determinants of LVH reduction are represented by baseline values of LVM, extent of blood pressure reduction and duration of treatment. Furthermore, the degree of cardiac hypertrophy reduction is not the same for the different classes of antihypertensive drugs because, beyond the control of blood pressure, they may interfere differently with several non-haemodynamic stimuli, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and the adrenergic systems or other growth factors. A more pronounced reduction in LVM with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists has been demonstrated in several recent meta-analyses. The results of further multicenter on-going trials are awaited to evaluate definitely whether various antihypertensive strategies differ in their ability to reverse LVH and to adequately assess the relationship between changes in LVM and subsequent prognosis, with serial control of blood pressure values measured in the clinic and by ambulatory monitoring.", 
    "185": "Guidelines for pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to the treatment of hypertension were first published in 1977 and were subsequently revised in the 1980s. They were largely based on the approach known as 'stepped care', which suggests that antihypertensive treatment should be started with the initial use of a thiazide diuretic, followed by the addition of a second, third and fourth drug if no satisfactory therapeutic success is obtained. This approach was reviewed in the guidelines that followed, which indicated that pharmacological treatment should be started in a more liberal fashion by selecting the antihypertensive drug from among four rather than two classes (diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists).", 
    "186": "The latest guidelines issued in 1993 by the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension and by the Joint National Committee contain innovative aspects on how to treat high blood pressure. They share common features, such as lifelong treatment of hypertension, attention to overall cardiovascular risk profile, initiation of treatment with lifestyle changes and subsequently with monotherapy, but they also have differences, such as goal blood pressure, initial blood pressure values to be treated and first-choice drug. For example, according to the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension guidelines first-choice drugs include five classes of drug, whereas the Joint National Committee guidelines advocate two classes of drug for first choice.", 
    "187": "It is likely that the 'stepped care' approach for hypertension treatment will continue to be employed in the future, although greater attention will be devoted to the need for combination drug treatment.

In contrast to the original VIP, the VIP analog demonstrated a slow onset and offset of action, with more than 90% of its maximum relaxation remaining 6 h after administration.

Four months old male SHRsp rats were orally treated with a high (10 mg/kg b.w. per day) or a low dose (1 mg/kg b.w. per day) of the AT1 receptor antagonist Telmisartan and compared to Losartan- (20 mg/kg b.w. per day), Captopril-treated (50 mg/kg b.w. per day) or untreated control groups for 38 days. Despite a similar extent of blood pressure reduction in all groups (except low dose Telmisartan), high dose Telmisartan but not Losartan or Captopril significantly reduced left ventricular weight by 24% compared to controls (p<0.05). Renal damage as assessed by urinary albumin or glomerulosclerosis index was significantly reduced in all treatment groups (p<0.02). Plasma renin concentration was significantly elevated (p<0.02) and plasma angiotensinogen significantly lowered (p<0.05) in all pharmacologically treated group compared to controls. In the kidney, renin-mRNA as well as AT1 receptor gene expression were elevated in all treatment groups, but no significant changes were found for renal angiotensinogen-mRNA. Chronic oral treatment of genetically hypertensive rats by the AT1 receptor antagonist Telmisartan reveals a blood pressure lowering and reno-protective effect of this drug comparable to other AT1 receptor antagonists or converting enzyme inhibitors, and demonstrates a marked reduction of cardiac hypertrophy by Telmisartan in this model.",

We examined the effects of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NNA on the hypotensive effects of captopril, the Ang II antagonist EXP 3174, or the renin inhibitor terlakiren. In sodium-depleted guinea pigs (GPs), L-NNA (3 mg/kg) increased MAP by 15-21% for at least 5 hours. L-NNA partially blocked the hypotensive effects of captopril (1 mg/kg, iv), but not those of EXP 3174 (1 mg/kg, iv) or terlakiren (3 mg/kg). In sodium-depleted rats, 10 mg/kg L-NNA (iv) increased MAP by 16-22%, and partially or fully blocked the hypotensive effect of EXP 3174 (1 mg/kg, iv) or captopril (3 mg/kg, iv), respectively. Thus, in contrast to the rat, NO in GPs appears to participate only in the hypotensive action of ACE inhibition and does not appear to be strongly involved in the hypotensive action of AII antagonism or renin inhibition. The involvement of NO in the hypotensive effects of RAS antagonists other than ACE inhibitors may be species-dependent.",

    "230": "Available information from 1980 to 1997 on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema and its underlying mechanisms are summarised and discussed. The incidence of angioedema is low (0.1 to 0.2%) but can be considered as a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of ACE inhibitor therapy. This adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, irrespective of the chemical structure, can occur early in treatment as well as after prolonged exposure for up to several years. The estimate incidence is quite underestimated. The actual incidence can be far higher because of poorly recognised presentation of angioedema as a consequence of its late onset in combination with usually long term therapy. Also, a spontaneous reporting bias can contribute to an actual higher incidence of this phenomenon. The incidence can be even higher (up to 3-fold) in certain risk groups, for instance Black Americans. Treatment includes immediate withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor and acute symptomatic supportive therapy followed by immediate (and long term) alternative therapy with other classes of drugs to manage hypertension and/or heart failure. Preclinical and clinical studies for the elucidation of the underlying mechanism(s) of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema have not generated definite conclusions. It is suggested that immunological processes and several mediator systems (bradykinin, histamine, substance P and prostaglandins) are involved in the pathogenesis of angioedema. A great part of all reviewed reports suggest a relationship between ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and increased levels of (tissue) bradykinin. However, no conclusive evidence of the role of bradykinin in angioedema has been found and an exclusive role of bradykinin seems unlikely. So far, no clear-cut evidence for an immune-mediated pathogenesis has been found. In addition, ACE gene polymorphism and some enzyme deficiencies are proposed to be involved in ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Progress in pharmacogenetic and molecular biological research should throw more light on a possible genetic component in the pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.",

This infiltrate is significantly reduced by administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor but not by a specific angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor) antagonist.

Rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) of 1, 3, or 5 days duration were untreated or given enalapril or SC-51316 in the drinking water. We measured the mRNA levels of monocyte chemoatactic peptide 1 (MCP-1), a chemoattractant, and levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), two cell surface adhesion proteins. MCP-1 mRNA increased significantly after 1 day of UUO and increased further through 5 days of UUO in the obstructed kidney. ICAM-1 mRNA also increased significantly after 1 day but steadily declined through 5 days of UUO in the obstructed kidney. VCAM-1 mRNA did not increase significantly until after 3 days of UUO and increased further through 5 days of obstruction. Enalapril or SC-51316 treatment had no significant effect on ICAM-1 mRNA levels. MCP-1 mRNA levels were reduced but remained significantly elevated. Enalapril significantly blunted the increase in VCAM-1 mRNA levels and VCAM-1 protein determined by immunocytochemistry; SC-51316 had no significant effect. Thus changes in VCAM-1 levels may account for the differential effect of enalapril and SC-51316 on monocyte/macrophage infiltration of the kidney during ureteral obstruction.", 
    "232": "Cardiac fibroblasts, an abundant cell of the left ventricle (LV), proliferate and synthesize collagen in the heart after acute injury and during pressure overload hypertrophy. From many studies, angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors have been implicated in promoting collagen formation by the rat cardiac fibroblast. The present study examined species variability in ANG II receptor expression. Cultured rat fibroblasts expressed 43,000 +/- 15,000 ANG II (AT1-specific) receptors per cell (dissociation constant = 0.92 +/- 0.34 nM), whereas rabbit and neonate human cardiac fibroblast cultures expressed few receptors. Angiotensin increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in rats but not in rabbit or human cardiac fibroblasts and stimulated arachidonic acid release in rat but not rabbit fibroblasts. In situ, 6 days after coronary artery ligation, angiotensin receptor expression was increased 34.8 +/- 13.4-fold in the infarcted area relative to the noninfarcted tissue in the rat LV, whereas rabbit hearts demonstrated only a 3.2 +/- 1.6-fold increase in ANG II binding within the infarcted tissue. These species differences in receptor expression raise questions as to the role of angiotensin as a mediator of collagen formation across species and as a direct target of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to regulate cardiac fibroblast function.", 
    "233": "End-stage renal disease, which signifies irreversible renal failure, constitutes a major and growing public health problem worldwide. The striking increase in end-stage renal disease has catalyzed clinical and investigative focus on pharmacologic interventions to retard progression to this condition. Increasing evidence indicates that some classes of antihypertensive medications may confer a greater effect than others in slowing progression of renal disease despite similar levels of blood pressure reduction. Substantive data indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition preferentially retards the progression of renal disease, primarily by protecting the injured kidney from hemodynamically mediated glomerular damage. Newer studies suggest that calcium antagonists also have diverse properties, which are independent of their renal microcirculatory effects that might afford renal protection.", 
    "234": "The presence of proteinuria has been shown to be an excellent predictor for a worse outcome of renal function. Both proteinuria and arterial hypertension often coexist in the same patient, and therapy must be directed at decreasing protein excretion in the urine as well as lowering the blood pressure. Any antihypertensive agent has the capacity to lower proteinuria simply by lowering blood pressure. Furthermore, the antiproteinuric capacity of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be equalized by other agents or their combination, provided that the fall in blood pressure is great enough. For this reason studies are needed in which the strict control of arterial hypertension combined with a decrease in proteinuria are considered.",

The cohort study included all inhabitants of one Swedish municipality who during 1988 or 1989 had purchased cardiovascular agents from pharmacies within the municipality.

Hazard ratios for risk of suicide with adjustments for difference in age and sex in users of calcium channel blockers compared with users of other hypertensive drugs.", 
    "239": "Among the Swedish municipalities the use of each cardiovascular drug group except angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors correlated significantly and positively with suicide rates. After adjustment for the use of other cardiovascular drug groups, as a substitute for the prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity, only the correlation with calcium channel blockers remained significant (r = 0.29, P < 0.001). In the cohort study, five users and four non-users of calcium channel blockers committed suicide during the follow up until the end of 1994. The absolute risk associated with use of calcium channel blockers was 1.1 suicides per 1000 person years. The relative risk, adjusted for differences in age and sex, among users versus non-users was 5.4 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 20.5).",

However, direct comparison of tubular and glomerular tracers, quantitative criteria, comparison of quantitative and qualitative results and the reliability of the results in renal failure have not been described in a systematic, prospective fashion.", 
    "242": "Same-day baseline and CR using 99mTc-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and [131I]orthoiodohippurate (OIH) were simultaneously performed in two groups of hypertensive subjects, one with demographically defined essential hypertension (n = 43) and the other (n = 60) with a high prevalence of renovascular disease, defined with angiograms. Quantitative criteria for abnormal CR were derived from results among the subjects with essential hypertension. Qualitative analysis was performed using widely established criteria.", 
    "243": "There were no statistically significant differences between quantitative and qualitative accuracy, between OIH and DTPA or among quantitative parameters. The best accuracies for quantitative CR were 56% with DTPA (n = 57) and 60% with OIH (n = 60), in both cases using the relative renal uptake parameter. Qualitative CR (n = 60) had accuracies of 43% (DTPA) and 50% (OIH), both hindered by 29 (DTPA) and 25 (OIH) abnormal but nondiagnostic studies. Two false-positive studies were detected. Twenty-seven of 29 nondiagnostic studies were associated with a glomerular filtration rate of <50 ml/min (n = 17), one small kidney (n = 17) and/or bilateral renal artery stenosis (n = 16). Supplemental measurement of in vitro stimulated plasma renin activity insignificantly (p > 0.10) and improved accuracies to 63% (DTPA) and 70% (OIH), without introducing additional false-positive tests.", 
    "244": "Orthoiodohippurate and DTPA have comparable accuracy in prospective simultaneous evaluation of CR. False-positive studies are fewer than 5%. The accuracies of quantitative and qualitative criteria do not differ significantly but may be improved by supplemental use of the in vitro stimulated plasma renin activity. In individuals with renal insufficiency, small kidneys and/or bilateral renal artery disease, up to 48% of CR studies are abnormal but nondiagnostic.", 
    "245": "The effect of captopril on tumour growth was examined in a xenograft model of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Inoculation of the human RCC cell line SN12K-1 (10(6) cells) under the left kidney capsule of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice resulted in the growth of large tumours, with an increase in weight of the inoculated kidney of 3.69+/-1.63-fold (mean+/-s.d.) when compared with the contralateral normal kidney. In mice treated with captopril (19 mg kg(-1) day(-1) or 94 mg kg(-1) day(-1) administered in the drinking water), there was a significant dose-related reduction in tumour development; the tumour bearing kidneys weighed 1.9+/-0.42 and 1.55+/-0.42 times the normal kidneys, respectively (P< 0.05 compared with untreated animals). In vitro, captopril at clinically achievable doses (0.1-10 microM) had no significant effect on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into SN12K-1 cells. Thus, this highly significant attenuation by captopril of in vivo tumour growth does not appear to be due to a direct effect on the proliferation of the tumour cells. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism of inhibition of tumour growth by captopril, in particular to evaluate the role of angiotensin II in this process.", 
    "246": "The clinical response to enalapril in 19 cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was evaluated retrospectively. Eleven cats were in congestive heart failure (CHF) at the time enalapril was prescribed, while only one cat was in CHF when the cats were reexamined three-to-six months later. Significant changes in cardiac dimensions were identified echocardiographically. No adverse effects on blood pressure, serum creatinine, or potassium were noted. Although the preliminary data suggests that enalapril is well tolerated and may contribute to some improvements in cats with HCM, controlled, prospective studies are needed to prove the efficacy of enalapril in this disease.", 
    "247": "We investigated the eicosanoid synthesis of platelets of Wistar and of Okamoto spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and the effect of captopril in vitro, using [14C]arachidonic acid as a tracer substrate and chromatographic determination. Lipoxygenase activity was elevated, while the formation of cyclooxygenase products was reduced in SHR platelets, compared to those of Wistar rats. This difference might play a role in the pathomechanism of hypertension in SHR. In SHR with lower blood pressure, captopril reduced thromboxane synthesis, while in SHR with higher blood pressure thromboxane synthesis was unchanged, but the synthesis of prostaglandin D2, a potent vasodilator, and of 12-L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid, a stimulator of endothelial prostacyclin formation, was increased. We may conclude that, in spite of the missing angiotensin converting enzyme in platelets, a direct effect on platelet eicosanoid synthesis could contribute to the blood pressure decreasing effect of captopril.", 
    "248": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AT1RA) slow the rate of progression of experimental renal disease. Although the end result of both classes of drugs is to block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACEI and AT1RA act at different sites in the RAS cascade. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an ACEI (enalapril) and AT1RA (losartan), alone or in combination, in slowing the progression of experimental renal disease in a model of reduced renal mass. Two weeks after 5/6 renal ablation, rats were divided into five groups matched for body weight, systolic BP (SBP), and urinary protein excretion rate (UprotV). The effects on SBP and UprotV of treatment with 25 and 40 mg/L enalapril (groups I and II; both n = 7), 180 mg/L losartan (group III, n = 8), or a combination of enalapril (25 mg/L) + losartan (180 mg/L) (group IV, n = 9) versus vehicle (group V, n = 9) were studied for 12 wk. Remnant kidneys were then assessed histologically for evidence of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and hyalinosis (FSGS), and interstitial fibrosis. There were no significant differences (NSD) in body weight among the groups at any time. Combination therapy reduced SBP (122 +/- 8 mmHg) significantly at 12 wk to levels similar to losartan (127 +/- 3 mmHg) or enalapril (40 mg/L) alone (124 +/- 5 mmHg) (P < 0.05 versus vehicle controls). With equivalent antihypertensive effects, no differences in frequency of FSGS were discerned among the treatment groups (groups II through IV; F = 1.7, NSD). Tubulointerstitial injury scores followed a similar pattern. BP was highly correlated with the extent of FSGS, both among individual rats (r = 0.68, P = 0.05) and the group means (r = 0.99, P = 0.001). We conclude that the renoprotective effects of enalapril, losartan, or combination therapy are similar in this model over the 12 wk of the study, and are closely related to the magnitude of their antihypertensive effects.", 
    "249": "Nitrates are widely used in the treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease and in those with angina following acute myocardial infarction. Short-term studies indicate that the administration of nitrates may prevent left ventricular (LV) dilation and infarct expansion. Animal models suggest that prolonged nitroglycerin use after infarction may limit LV remodeling similar to that observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, to date there have been no trials evaluating the effects of nitrates on LV volumes in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction. We therefore performed a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to investigate the long-term (6 month) efficacy of intermittent transdermal nitroglycerin patches on LV remodeling in 291 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or a nitroglycerin patch that delivered 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 mg/hour. Gated radionuclide angiography was used to assess serial changes in LV ejection and cardiac volumes. The baseline characteristics of the study population were similar in all 4 treatment groups. The study protocol and the main design-related issues are described.", 
    "250": "Cardiovascular disease remains a major health problem in today's society. It is estimated that more than 6 million people have a history of myocardial infarction and/or angina (Abraham, 1995). Hypertension is another major health problem affecting at least 50 million people in the United States (Johannsen, 1993). Due to the high prevalence of these conditions, many orthopaedic patients will be taking one or more cardiac medications. This article discusses the indications, mechanisms of action, side effects, and nursing implications for the major classes of cardiac medications. The purpose of this article is to enhance the nurse clinician's knowledge of these medications and to optimize the patient's nursing care.", 
    "251": "Long-term administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induces development of NO-deficient hypertension. The aim of the present study was to determine whether treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril can prevent hypertension, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, changes in nucleic acid concentration, protein synthesis and protein profile of the left ventricle. Four groups of rats were investigated: control, L-NAME 40 mg/kg/day, captopril 100 mg/kg/day, L-NAME 40 mg/kg/day along with captopril 100 mg/kg/day. NO-synthase activity in the left ventricle was found to be decreased by 69% in the L-NAME group. Captopril did not influence this inhibition of NO-synthase activity. However, it completely prevented hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy development. The increase in left ventricular RNA and DNA concentration and -14C-leucine incorporation observed in the L-NAME group was completely prevented by simultaneous captopril treatment. The protein profile of the left ventricle in the L-NAME group was characterized by higher concentration of metabolic proteins (MP), soluble collagenous proteins (SCP) and of hydroxyproline in insoluble collagenous proteins (ICP). The concentration of hydroxyproline in ICP was significantly decreased by simultaneous captopril treatment. We conclude that captopril prevented the development of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, increase in nucleic acid concentration and diminished collagen concentration by mechanisms different from affecting NO-synthase activity.", 
    "252": "The effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor therapy in attenuating ventricular remodeling when initiated immediately following myocardial damage is clearly established. Less information, however, is available on the impact of late therapy on the remodeling process, especially its influence on the cellular components of these structural changes. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of converting enzyme inhibitor therapy commenced 28 days following infarction in the rat on changes in cardiac myocyte dimension and the interstitium. At 28 days following infarction, myocyte cell length (153.9+/-7.3 v 131.1+/-5.9 micron, P=0.0002) and cell volume in the free wall of the left ventricle (38. 5+/-5.0 x 10(3) v31.4+/-3.1 x 10(3), P=0.009) had increased compared with sham-operated rats. Similar changes were noted in the septum and right ventricle. Captopril therapy administered between 28 and 56 days attenuated a further increase in cell length noted in an untreated group in the left ventricle (153.5+/-15.3 v 167.3+/-13.7 micron, P=0.02), right ventricle (153.8+/-20.5 v 173.8+/-2.3 micron, P=0.01) and septum (158.0+/-20.2 v 179.1+/-16.6 micron, P=0.004). There was an increase in hydroxyproline content in the right ventricle and a similar trend in the left ventricle in the untreated myocardial infarction groups. These changes were not altered by captopril therapy. In summary, even late therapy with captopril attenuates progressive myocyte remodeling, which may contribute to the ability of ACE-inhibitor therapy to slow progressive chamber enlargement following infarction.", 
    "253": "Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are common morphological correlates of many end-stage kidneys. There is ample evidence that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays a major role in these alterations by directly stimulating synthesis of many extracellular matrix components and reducing collagenase production, finally leading to renal scarring. Although many factors may induce TGF-beta expression in the kidney, one very interesting aspect is the link between angiotensin II (ANG II) and TGF-beta. Originating from observations in vascular smooth muscle cells, there are now several additional studies showing that ANG II stimulates TGF-beta expression in the kidney. Although cell culture studies have convincingly demonstrated that the vasoactive peptide directly stimulates transcription as well as bioactivation of TGF-beta, the in vivo evidence is more indirect. Nevertheless, there are several pathophysiological situations including unilateral ureteral obstruction, chronic cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity, various models of hypertension, and probably diabetic nephropathy in which ANG II-mediated TGF-beta induction has been demonstrated to play an important role in the progression of the disease. The fascinating aspect of this relationship between ANG II and TGF-beta is the fact that hemodynamic changes as well as structural changes are linked together generating a unifying model of progression of chronic renal failure with ANG II as the key player. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and the more recently introduced AT1-receptor blocker may be potential drugs to interfere with this ANG II-mediated TGF-beta expression. Therefore, these drugs should not only be considered as antihypertensive medications, but should rather be viewed as renoprotective substances influencing renal remodeling by preventing local TGF-beta expression.", 
    "254": "Central sleep apnoea (CSA) in congestive heart failure is sleep state dependent and occurs typically in stages I and II of non-REM sleep. The pre-requisites are hypocapnia and some prolongation of the circulation time. It is not certain whether abnormalities in after-discharge activity in the brainstem are also important. The presence of CSA in patients with left ventricular dysfunction is a poor prognostic sign and associated with a higher mortality in that group compared to age, sex and ejection fraction matched patients with congestive cardiac failure alone. It is reasonable to speculate that the CSA causes an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity which would maintain afterload at a high level or tend to increase it with time. The application of a high afterload to an impaired left ventricle leads over time to a further reduction in ejection fraction. From other studies, particularly ACE inhibitor studies, it is known that ejection fraction and prognosis are almost linearly related. It could therefore be said that once CSA has developed it may lead to a vicious circle of increasing afterload and further reduction in ejection fraction, causing worsening CSA and further increases in afterload. A number of treatments have been shown to be of benefit: supplemental nocturnal oxygen therapy, acetazolamide and nasal CPAP therapy have all been shown to reduce CSA. In addition nasal continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) has been shown by two groups in Canada to also improve ejection fraction. The beneficial effects on ejection fraction in particular, persist after the treatment has been withdrawn, which suggests either remodelling of the left ventricular musculature or a resetting of the baseline sympathetic nervous system activity. The impressive increase in ejection fraction due to three months nasal CPAP therapy in one study (an average 35% increase) is both dramatic and exciting for the future. It is reasonable to expect improvement in prognosis for patients with CCF whose ejection fraction rises with CPAP treatment. Finally, only a limited number of studies have been published. Unfortunately the impressive results from Canada have not yet been reproduced in other centres around the world.",

Both, insulin MONO-ID in the doses of 6 U/kg administered subcutaneously, and water solution of ramipril administered by gastric probe were applied for the period of 8 weeks. We have assessed blood levels of glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fructoseamine and the concentration of cholesterol and triacylglycerols have been assessed also in the liver. Oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria of the liver were measured polarographically.",

Ramipril did not affect the concentration of cholesterol and triacylglycerols in the blood and liver in rats with IDDM. Ramipril has positively affected oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria of the liver in coincidence with IDDM. The group with IDDM + ramipril has yielded an increase in the velocity of oxygen consumption in coincidence with stimulated breathing with ADP, the state 3 (M 107.97 CI 96.78-134.51 n AtO/mg of proteins/min.) and phosphorylation velocity (M 232.67 CI 209.38-284.97 nmolATP/protein/min) in contrast to the group with IDDM: the state 3 (M 76.71 CI 66.81-85.99 nAtO/mg of proteins/min and the velocity of phosphorylation (M 161.84 CI 143.55-189.99 nmol ATP/mg of proteins/min) in coincidence with substrate glutamate.

    "260": "Each of 5 drugs, i.e., 4 different vasodilator drugs (captopril, enalapril, hydralazine and prazosin) and a cardiotonic drug (digoxin), was administered to dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) for 1-72 days in order to quantitatively evaluate the influence of therapeutic agents on blood flow in heart disease. Hemodynamic changes were assessed before and after administration of each drug by determining mitral regurgitant jet mapping area (MRMA) and aortic forward flow mapping area (AFMA), which were displayed by the color Doppler method, and the ratio of MRMA to AFMA (MRMA/AFMA) as parameters. When the four vasodilator drugs were used appropriately, MRMA and MRMA/AFMA decreased in all cases, compared with the values before the administration. These two parameters showed dose-dependent changes after administration of captopril, enalapril and hydralazine. When the cardiotonic drug was used. MRMA and MRMA/AFMA increased in 4 of 5 cases. The MRMA/AFMA values were slightly more reproducible than the MRMA values, whereas the AFMA values showed no constant tendency when any vasodilator drug or the cardiotonic drug was used. These results suggest that the efficacy of cardiotonic and vasodilator drugs in MR can be quantitatively evaluated by determining MRMA/AFMA in particular, and MRMA.", 
    "261": "In Hungary the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril has emerged as one of the most important drugs in the treatment of hypertension. The aim of our study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of enalapril of Hungarian production in combination therapy and alone, according to sexes, to the body mass index, among smokers and non smokers as well as non diabetic and in patients with diabetes (IDDM and NIDDM). The diurnal blood pressure values were registered by a 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. During the 6 weeks of the enalapril therapy (n = 28) both the daytime (141/84 vs. 135/80 mmHg) and the night-time (130/78 vs. 124/72 mmHg) blood pressure values decreased; the increase of diurnal indices during the therapy (SI/DI 6/8% vs. 8/10) reflect the 24 hour long lasting effect of the drug. The body mass index had no influence on the efficacy of treatment. Our results indicate that enalapril manufactured in Hungary is an effective antihypertensive drug both in monotherapy and in combination, in both sexes (especially in men), irrespective of the body weight, in non-smokers and especially in smokers, in insulin dependent and in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus alike.",

For non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy varies from 15% to 60% and is influenced by genetic background. Early screening and controlling of microalbumin levels are essential to affect the outcome of diabetic nephropathy. Studies show that clinical renal dysfunction in diabetics does not correlate well with the histological abnormalities. Strategies for nephropreservation include close lipid, glycemic, and blood pressure control, and tobacco termination. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert nephroprotective effects beyond their beneficial blood pressure-lowering effects.

    "267": "Four antihypertensive agents - amlodipine, verapamil, propranolol and perindoprilat - were studied in human cell cultures. Antiatherogenic activity was investigated using uninvolved human aortic smooth muscle intima cells and atherogenic serum obtained from patients with coronary atherosclerosis. Amlodipine and verapamil significantly inhibited serum-induced increases in cholesterol content, cell-proliferative activity and protein synthesis in the cultured cells. Propranolol increased all three parameters, while perindoprilat had no effects. In addition, amlodipine and verapamil significantly lowered the intracellular cholesterol content of smooth muscle cells derived from atherosclerotic plaque and inhibited cell proliferation and protein synthesis. Propranolol increased all of these parameters, while perindoprilat produced no effects. The antiatherogenic and antiatherosclerotic actions of verapamil and amlodipine were confirmed in an ex vivo model. These studies demonstrated a beneficial antiatherosclerotic effect of amlodipine that was greater than that of verapamil. Perindoprilat had a neutral effect on atherosclerotic parameters, while the action of propranolol appeared to be potentially detrimental.",

Baclofen, an agonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), has been shown, in animals, to have antitussive activity via a central mechanism. Recently, in normal subjects, we have demonstrated the ability of baclofen to inhibit capsaicin-induced cough, as well as cough due to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Herein, we describe two patients with chronic, refractory cough who obtained symptomatic improvement after a 14-day course of low-dose, oral baclofen, administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. In addition, both subjects demonstrated significant increases in cough threshold to inhaled capsaicin after treatment with baclofen.", 
    "269": "The effects of the addition of a calcium channel blocker, verapamil (20 mg/kg/day) to an ACE inhibitor, trandolapril (0.7 mg/kg/day) in a 6-month treatment on renal insufficiency development in rats with 5/6th nephrectomy, were studied. Every month we measured heart rate and arterial pressure by the tail-cuff method. Renal function studies were performed in metabolic cages. At the end of the study, renal tissue was prepared for light microscope analysis. Renal lesions were assessed by semiquantitative scores in a blind fashion. Corpuscular section area, intraglomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis were determined by digital image analysis with a specific software (Fibrosis HR) on syrium red-stained renal sections. Trandolapril markedly increased the survival ratio that after 6 months reached 87% in comparison with 61% in untreated rats. No mortality was observed in rats treated with the combination of verapamil and trandolapril. Trandolapril treatment prevented the development of hypertension. The combination verapamil-trandolapril did not induce further reduction on blood pressure. The untreated group showed a marked proteinuria, that in the trandolapril group showed an important reduction. The verapamil + trandolapril group showed a proteinuria significantly smaller than that of all the other groups. Light microscopy semiquantitative studies of the renal injury showed that the trandolapril and verapamil + trandolapril groups had a marked reduction in glomerular and tubulointerstitial alterations, compared with untreated animals. Quantitative determinations of glomerular and interstitial fibrosis performed on syrium red-stained renal sections demonstrated that fibrosis was reduced when rats when treated with trandolapril and even more with verapamil + trandolapril when they were compared to untreated animals' values. In conclusion, long-term treatment with verapamil given in addition to trandolapril produces additional protection against progressive renal injury associated to subtotal nephrectomy.", 
    "270": "We studied the effect of the combination of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and spontaneous renal injury in male MWF rats. Renal hemodynamics was studied by micropuncture 1 month after streptozotocin administration, and kidney morphological evaluation was performed after 4 months of diabetes. We also studied the effect of angiotensin II antagonism on development of renal lesions. Untreated animals developed mild hypertension, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis. Induction of diabetes, and maintenance of a moderate hyperglycemic state, was associated with slight but significant elevation in systemic and glomerular capillary blood pressure. Development of proteinuria was not accelerated or exacerbated by diabetes. Glomerular and tubular structural changes were also not worsened by diabetes. Antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor (benazepril) or with an AII receptor antagonist (valsartan) almost completely prevented systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension, proteinuria and renal structural changes. No significant differences in glomerular volume were observed among the four groups. That induction of experimental diabetes, although associated with glomerular capillary hypertension, did not aggravate the rate of progression of renal dysfunction would suggest that glomerular injury is not directly influenced by glomerular hemodynamic conditions in these animals. Prevention of renal functional and structural abnormalities by antagonism of AII activity in diabetic MWF rats suggests a pathogenetic role for angiotensin in inducing the renal disease in these animals.", 
    "271": "Deletion polymorphism of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been reported to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was proposed to be a link between the renin-angiotensin system and thrombotic risk. This study was undertaken to investigate the possible association between the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene and plasma PAI-1 levels in 160 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers flanking the polymorphic region in intron 16 of the ACE gene. Baseline levels of PAI-1 antigen and activity and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen were determined in fasting morning plasma samples. It was found that patients with homozygote deletion (DD, n = 37) ACE genotype did not have significantly higher plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen (31.2 +/- 15.6 ng/mL v 28.4 +/- 15.1 ng/mL or 27.2 +/- 13.2 ng/mL, P = .42), PAI-1 activity (16.2 +/- 10.6 IU/mL v 14.1 +/- 9.4 IU/ mL or 15.0 +/- 9.9 IU/mL, P = .60), or t-PA antigen (14.6 +/- 6.0 ng/mL v 13.4 +/- 4.9 ng/mL or 14.6 +/- 5.7 ng/mL, P = .40) as compared to those with heterozygote (DI, n = 67) or homozygote insertion (II, n = 56) genotypes. On multiple regression analysis, the ACE genotypes did not appear to be significant predictors for plasma PAI-1 levels and t-PA antigen after adjustment with age, sex, body mass index, plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and glucose. In conclusion, the results indicated that the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was not related to plasma PAI-1 levels in a Chinese population with hypertension. The ACE genotypes may not have a role in influencing the fibrinolysis in hypertension.", 
    "272": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. In the present study we examined the genotype frequencies of the insertion/deletion polymorphisms of the ACE gene and the M235T polymorphism of the Angiotensinogen (Agt) gene in patients with essential hypertension in comparison with normotensive subjects. In hypertensive patients functional effects of blood pressure response to ACE inhibition were investigated. A total of 121 patients with essential hypertension (group 1) and 125 normotensive control subjects (group 2) were included in this study. All patients were genotyped by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene and the M235T polymorphism of the Agt gene. To analyze possible functional impacts on blood pressure regulation 50 mg of captopril was administered to hypertensive patients. No significant association of essential hypertension with polymorphisms of the Agt and ACE gene was found. The ACE serum levels in patients with the DD-genotype of the ACE I/D polymorphism were higher than in patients with the II-genotype (P < .01). In patients with the ID-genotype the ACE serum levels were in-between. A captopril test was performed in hypertensive patients. The patients were further divided into subgroups according to the diastolic and systolic blood pressure response. Group 1a consisted of patients with a diastolic blood pressure drop of > 5 mm Hg and group 1b with < or =5 mm Hg. Group 1c consisted of patients with a systolic blood pressure drop of > 10 mm Hg and group 1d with < or =10 mm Hg. Twice as many patients with the DD genotype of the ACE gene were found in group 1a compared to group 1b (chi(2) = 5.673; P = .017). No association of systolic blood pressure change to the investigated polymorphisms was found. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the investigated polymorphisms contribute to essential hypertension. Furthermore, no major impact of these polymorphisms on blood pressure response to captopril were detected. We conclude that the investigated genotypes have no influence on blood pressure level and homeostasis.", 
    "273": "The aim of this study was to compare blood pressure rise after interruption of two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertensive patients. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, hypertensive patients were treated with either trandolapril 2 mg once daily or perindopril 4 mg once daily for 4 weeks in a double-blind design. A placebo was then administered for 1 week. Three periods of 1-week home self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) were programmed: end of placebo run-in period, end of treatment period, and final withdrawal placebo period. Every day, three consecutive measurements were requested both in the evening and in the morning. Individual reversion to baseline BP level was studied in the subgroup of patients responding to therapy (evening diastolic SMBP decrease > or =6 mm Hg). The ratio (R) of mean post-drug DBP lowering (residual effect) over evening on-drug DBP lowering (full effect) was used to study reversion to baseline. Patients exhibiting a lower value than the median of this ratio were called Reverters, whereas others were called Nonreverters. One hundred-nineteen patients entered the analysis. During the treatment period, mean SMBP decreased significantly, from 150 +/- 14/97 +/- 7 mm Hg to 139 +/- 15/91 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P < .001). The on-drug BP level was similar in the evening in the two treatment groups. However, both systolic and diastolic morning SMBP levels were significantly lower in the trandolapril group. After drug discontinuation, the mean BP level significantly rose to 144 +/- 14/94 +/- 9 mm Hg (all P = .01) but remained lower than the baseline BP values (P = .003 for SBP and P = .002 for DBP). The post-drug BP level was significantly lower in the trandolapril group than in the perindopril group. Seventy-four patients were responders to therapy. In this subgroup, the median of the R ratio used to analyze reversion to baseline after drug discontinuation was 44%. Nonreverters were characterized by a sustained on-drug BP decrease, compared to Reverters. We therefore conclude that ACE inhibitor treatment withdrawal is accompanied by a rapid rise in BP (within 48 h), followed by a 5-day BP plateau that is lower than the initial level. Reverters to baseline after drug discontinuation were more likely to be insufficiently controlled during therapy, particularly in the morning. The longer duration of action of trandolapril was associated with a lower BP level during both the morning during the active treatment phase and the 1-week posttreatment phase.", 
    "274": "We examined the influence of procedures used in blood pressure measurement on blood pressure and the effects of antihypertensive agents. Subjects were spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their Wistar/Kyoto (WKY) controls. Blood pressure was recorded by telemetry. Twenty-four h baseline pressure were measured, and the effect of minor handling on blood pressure and heart rate was examined. The influence of restraint such as is used for tail-cuff blood pressures was examined. The effects of three different antihypertensive drugs was also examined in the SHR. In the home-cage environment, the SHRs showed higher systolic blood pressures, but had similar hypertensive responses to minor handling as the WKYs. Both strains had elevated heart rate and blood pressure when restrained in the manner used for tail-cuff readings. The antihypertensive effects of captopril and losartan in the SHR were unchanged when the animals were restrained but the hypotensive effect of hydralazine was greater. These results confirm that significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure can occur as a result of the minor procedures frequently used in blood pressure recording in both SHR and WKY rats. This suggests that telemetry may have significant advantages as a method for continuous blood pressure monitoring. The pharmacological profile of antihypertensive drugs may well be different in animals where telemetry is employed and are not subject to the stresses involved in previous methods of monitoring blood pressure.", 
    "275": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical gas and a short-lived messenger which has many paracrine functions. Direct assessment of NO production is very difficult in vivo. However, the paranasal cavities generate a high amount of NO which diffuses in the nasal cavity where it can be easily measured. Several studies have suggested alterations of the NO production in heart failure. Thus, we assessed nasal NO concentration in normal subjects and in heart failure patients. The nasal NO concentration averaged 227 +/- 10 ppb in the control group (n = 20), and 210 +/- 10, 198 +/- 20 and 159 +/- 54 ppb in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II (n = 30), III (n = 28) and IV (n = 7) patients, respectively (mean +/- standard error [SE], not significant using analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Nasal NO level was not influenced by age, sex or etiology of the heart failure or by treatment with frusemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or digoxin. However, treatment with NO-releasing drugs (nitrates or molsidomine) significantly decreased the nasal NO level in heart failure patients. A two-way ANOVA revealed that treatment with a NO-releasing drug influenced nasal NO concentration (P = 0.0005), whereas NYHA class did not (P = 0.23), with a trend towards an interaction between the two parameters (P = 0.09): the inhibitory effect of NO-releasing drug on nasal NO concentration was more pronounced in severe heart failure. In an additional group of 12 patients (NYHA class II or III), the nasal NO concentration was 174 +/- 19 ppb during NO-releasing drug treatment and increased to 231 +/- 27 ppb 3 days after withdrawal of the nitrates (P = 0.0007 using paired t-test). Conversely, the nasal NO concentration in another group of seven patients (NYHA class II or III) was 219 +/- 32 ppb without nitrate treatment and decreased to 188 +/- 28 ppb 7 days after nitrate addition (P = 0.02 using paired t-test). In contrast, the nasal NO concentration in another group of ten ischemic patients without heart failure was 203 +/- 25 ppb without nitrate treatment and was similar (207 +/- 28 ppb) 7 days after nitrate addition (not significant using paired t-test). In conclusion, nasal NO production is normal in heart failure, except in patients receiving NO-releasing drugs. Nasal NO concentration could be useful for investigating the mechanism(s) by which exogenous NO donors decrease endogenous NO production.", 
    "276": "Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy is a rare complication of pheochromocytoma. We present a case of pheochromocytoma that developed preoperative heart failure. Left ventricular dilation and severe hypokinesia were demonstrated by echocardiography. Heart failure was successfully treated with digitalis, diuretics and captopril. There were no surgical complications and the follow up showed and improvement on the systolic function evaluated by echocardiography and isotope ventriculography, 3 and 6 months after surgery. We review the pathophysiology and evolution of catecholamine induced cardiomyopathy. Preload reserve can be one of the adaptive mechanisms of the ventricle in catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. Conventional therapy of hypertension and heart failure can be effective to correct the symptoms of cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "277": "The factors that contribute to a preferential anatomic localization of pemphigus lesions are not well known. In particular, the question arises as to whether certain skin areas may be more acantholysis-prone than others.", 
    "278": "To verify whether, in pemphigus patients, a different susceptibility to acantholysis exists among different cutaneous regions, the technique of tissue cultures was used.", 
    "279": "Normal human skin explants from two distinct anatomic regions (back and buttocks) of two former pemphigus patients were cultured in vitro in the presence of enalapril (6 mM) or cystamine (10 mM), two substances with a proven biochemical acantholytic effect. After 4 days of culture, the tissues were processed for standard histology.", 
    "280": "Diffuse acantholysis, with large intraepidermal splits, was observed in the explants taken from the backs of both subjects and cultured with either enalapril or cystamine. Mild to moderate acantholytic changes were detected in the explants taken from the buttocks of both subjects and cultured with either enalapril or cystamine. No structural changes were seen in the control cultures.", 
    "281": "Pemphigus patients present different thresholds of acantholysis in different areas of their bodies. This might explain, at least in part, certain preferential anatomic localizations of pemphigus lesions.", 
    "282": "We present 20 patients in whom drug therapy was associated with interstitial histiocytic infiltrates with variable degeneration of collagen and elastic fibers mimicking early lesions of granuloma annulare (GA). Most patients had a reproducible clinical presentation comprising erythematous-to-violaceous, nonpruritic plaques, often with an annular pattern, predominantly involving inner aspects of the arms, medial thighs and intertriginous areas. The most frequent clinical differential diagnoses included cutaneous T cell lymphoma, erythema annulare centrifigum (EAC), GA, and lupus erythematosus. A drug reaction was suspected in only 3 cases. The implicated drug classes included calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, antihistamines, anticonvulsants and antidepressants. Patients were often on two or more of these drugs; all have been associated with pseudolymphomatous infiltrates of the skin, the presumptive basis of which is iatrogenic pertubation of immune function. The defining histomorphology was diffuse infiltration of the interstitium by lymphocytes and histiocytes with piecemeal fragmentation of collagen and elastic fibers in concert with a vacuolar interface dermatitis. Ten cases showed intermediate and transformed lymphocytes with hyperchromatic convoluted nuclei disposed interstitially within the dermis or along the dermoepiderma junction with variable epidermotropism. In the 15 patients who discontinued the implicated drug, lesional resolution occurred. We propose the designations interstitial granulomatous drug reaction for this novel cutaneous reaction pattern.", 
    "283": "Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) in the 1980's, more than 50 cases of foetotoxic effects ascribed to intrauterine exposure to inhibitors have been published. Among the most commonly reported effects are: Hypotension, renal dysplasia, anuria/oliguria, oligohydramios, intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary hypoplasia, unclosed ductus arteriosus, incomplete ossification of the skull, intrauterine og neonatal death. Recent animal studies have confirmed that intrauterine or neonatal exposure to ACE-inhibitors or the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan can cause death and serious, irreversible organ damage. These effects are similar to the complications previously reported in humans. Animal studies suggest that the foetotoxic actions are most common after exposure during the last trimester. However, due to the severity of these complications, the use of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists should be avoided throughout pregnancy and in women who are breast feeding.", 
    "284": "Angiotensin II is vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic; it also stimulates cell growth and proliferation in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in hypertrophy or hyperplasia of conduit and resistance vessels. These actions are mediated through angiotensin II receptors (AT1 subtype), which activate several G-protein-dependent intracellular transduction pathways, such as the phospholipase C, diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of the transcription (STAT)-mediated pathway. These can all increase the expression of certain proto-oncogenes, particularly c-fos. Angiotensin II also stimulates the activity of certain growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor-A-chain and basic fibroblast growth factor. The cellular responses to angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle have been shown in different hypertensive vessels to be either hypertrophy alone, hypertrophy and DNA synthesis without cell division (polyploidy), or DNA synthesis with cell division (hyperplasia). In genetic hypertension, there is either cellular hyperplasia or remodeling, whereas in renovascular hypertension, there is hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent or reverse vascular hypertrophy in animal models of hypertension. In human hypertension, ACE inhibitors reduce the increased media/lumen ratio of large and small arteries and increase arterial compliance. These properties are also shared by AT1 receptor antagonists. The implications of these findings for morbidity and mortality in hypertension still await rigorous testing in prospective clinical trials.", 
    "285": "Chronic nephropathies are associated with enhanced renal synthesis of endothelin (ET)-1. A recent study demonstrated that an ET(A) receptor antagonist given to diabetic rats at the moment of disease induction prevented the development of renal injury. Here we investigated whether an unselective ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist, PD 142,893, was renoprotective when given to streptozotocin diabetic rats when animals were already proteinuric. The effect of PD 142,893 was compared with that of an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, known to retard progressive renal disease in experimental and human diabetes. PD 142,893 normalized systemic blood pressure, reduced urinary protein and albumin excretion, and ameliorated renal blood flow in diabetic rats, but it did not affect such parameters in control rats. Lisinopril had a renoprotective effect comparable to PD 142,893, although lisinopril controlled systemic blood pressure better. Northern blot analysis of ET-1 mRNA revealed upregulation of ET-1 gene in the diabetic kidney. Similar results were obtained by in situ hybridization in glomeruli and tubuli of diabetic rats. Both treatments remarkably attenuated exaggerated renal ET-1 gene expression. These data suggest that ET-1 is a contributory mediator of kidney damage in diabetes and indicate that ET receptor antagonists may represent a new therapeutic mean for treatment of progressive diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "286": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis in diabetic kidney disease. However, tubulointerstitial pathology may also be an important determinant of progressive renal dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy. In the present study, we investigated tubulointerstitial injury, TGF-beta1 expression, and the effect of blocking the RAS by inhibition of ACE. We randomized 36 male SD rats to control and diabetic groups. Diabetes was induced in 24 rats by administration of streptozotocin; 12 diabetic rats were further randomized to receive the ACE inhibitor ramipril (3 mg/l drinking water). At 6 months, experimental diabetes was associated with tubulointerstitial damage, a 70% increase in expression of TGF-beta1 (P < 0.05 vs. control), and a 120% increase in alpha1 (IV) collagen gene expression (P < 0.01 vs. control). In situ hybridization demonstrated a diffuse increase in both TGF-beta1 and alpha1 (IV) collagen mRNA in renal tubules. In addition, intense expression of both transcripts was noted in regions of focal tubular dilatation. Administration of the ACE inhibitor ramipril prevented tubulointerstitial injury and the overexpression of TGF-beta1 and alpha1 (IV) collagen mRNA. Changes in gene expression were accompanied by parallel changes in immunostaining for TGF-beta1 and type IV collagen. The observed beneficial effects of ramipril on the tubulointerstitium in experimental diabetes suggest that this mechanism may contribute to the therapeutic effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "287": "Increased mortality and reduced functional capacity are the two main characteristics of chronic heart failure. Activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems has a primary role in the progressive worsening of heart failure and increased mortality of patients. In addition, both systems may be important in the pathogenesis of exercise intolerance, although there is only a weak relationship between neurohormonal activation and exercise capacity. While neurohormonal antagonists, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers, consistently improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure, their effects on exercise tolerance have often been less significant. This problem has been emphasized by the introduction of beta-blockers for the therapy of heart failure. Beta blockade results in a significant improvement in left ventricular function during rest and exercise. However, the reduction in chronotropic response to exercise as well as the metabolic changes caused by these agents in skeletal muscle may result in an apparent lack of change in maximal functional capacity. This effect is particularly important with the new third generation non-selective beta-blockers. The pronounced anti-adrenergic activity of these compounds accounts for their greater negative chronotropic effect and relates to the lack of improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO2). Submaximal exercise testing can be used to assess changes induced by these agents. However, even the six-minute walk test may act as an almost maximal test in patients with advanced heart failure: moreover, the measurement of submaximal exercise duration may be sensitive enough to detect changes in single-centre trials, but not in multicentre trials. To date, direct assessment of symptoms by both patient and physician is still the most sensitive tool to monitor changes in functional status with non-selective beta-blockers. Thus, an accurate method of measuring patients' symptoms, in addition to the clinical examination, is still necessary when neurohormonal antagonists are used in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "288": "This study investigated the drinking response and the expression of Fos- and Egr-1-immunoreactivity (Fos-ir; Egr-1-ir) in the brain induced by endogenous angiotensin generated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of renin. Renin induced Fos-ir in the subfornical organ (SFO), median preoptic (MnPO), supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (SON and PVN), area postrema (AP), nuclei of the solitary tract (NTS) and lateral parabrachial nuclei (LPBN). Renin-induced Egr-1-ir exhibited a similar pattern of distribution as that observed for Fos-ir. The dose of i.c.v. renin that induced expression of immediate early gene (IEG) product immunoreactivity also produced vigorous drinking. When renin-injected rats were pretreated with captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, drinking was blocked. With the same captopril pretreatment, both Fos- and Egr-1-ir in the SFO, MnPO, SON, PVN, AP and LPBN were also significantly reduced.", 
    "289": "This study was performed to demonstrate an experimental procedure of pulmonary edema induced by angiotensin I (AT I) in rats and to elucidate the mechanism of hemodynamic pulmonary edema. In the previous pilot study, 20 microg/kg of AT I was found to be an adequate dose for inducing pulmonary edema. To elucidate the mechanism of AT I pulmonary edema and protective measures against it, we observed the effects of captopril (CAP, 5 and 10 mg/kg), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor; losartan (LOS, 10 mg/kg), an angiotensin II (AT II)-receptor antagonist; and phentolamine (PHE, 10 mg/kg), an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, on AT I-induced pulmonary edema in rats. Similarly, we also observed the effects of CAP (10 and 20 mg/kg) on pulmonary edema induced by 25 microg/kg of adrenaline (ADR) in rats. The development of AT I-induced pulmonary edema was significantly suppressed by CAP and LOS, but was unaffected by PHE. In contrast, the development of ADR-induced pulmonary edema was not suppressed by CAP. These results suggest that AT I-induced pulmonary edema is developed via the AT II and a specific AT II-receptor, without the indirect action of adrenaline.", 
    "290": "In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in the secondary prevention of microvascular complications. There are only few data available regarding the effect of ACEI on microcirculation in patients with IDDM without any microvascular complications. In addition, there is little knowledge about ACEI action during acute hyperglycemia. In a pilot study nine patients with IDDM without any clinical signs of diabetic complications (5 females, 4 males, aged 33.3 +/- 1.0 years, duration of diabetes 11.4 +/- 3.0 years, HbA1 7.2 +/- 0.2% [normal range 4.8-7.4%], BMI 21.4 +/- 0.5 [kg/m2]) received 1.25 mg of the ACEI ramipril (Delix, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Frankfurt) over 4 weeks. Nine healthy volunteers (4 females, 5 males, age 27.4 +/- 1.1 years, HbA1 5.9 +/- 0.2% (p < 0.01 vs patients), BMI 22.2 +/- 0.9 [kg/m2]) served as controls. Using nailfold capillaroscopy we determined capillary blood cell velocity (CapiFlow, Lawrenz Electronics, Sulzbach, Germany) before and during post-occlusive hyperemia (200 mmHg for 3 minutes) as a provocative test. Before and after treatment patients were studied during hyperglycemia (blood glucose 250-350 mg/dl). Treatment with low-dose ramipril resulted in a significant decrease in the time to peak capillary blood cell velocity during post-occlusive hyperemia (17.8 +/- 7.7 vs 57.4 +/- 12.8 s, p < 0.01) in hyperglycemic patients. This effect was absent in healthy volunteers. Hemodynamic and metabolic parameters remained unchanged throughout the study in both groups. These data demonstrate that low-dose therapy with the ACEI ramipril is able to improve microcirculation in hyperglycemic patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus also before microvascular complications are evident. Prospective studies are necessary to evaluate whether this effect might be clinically relevant in the primary prevention of diabetic microangiopathy.", 
    "291": "The history of the use of beta-blockers for congestive heart failure, beginning with the innovative seminal study by the Swedish group in 1975 to studies in 1995, is reviewed and shows that almost all trials favored the use of beta-blockers. They tended to demonstrate an increase in ejection fraction, a decrease in left ventricular mass, and in some studies, even a decrease in mortality. Even after the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, additional improvement in function and mortality was observed. Patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy derived more benefit from beta-blockers than did patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Least likely to benefit were patients treated for <2 months, patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and those with marked intercellular fibrosis. Although the starting dose of metoprolol, the most common beta-blocker used, may have to be as low as 2.5 mg/d, mortality analysis failed to show a decrease in sudden death unless the dose was raised to about 300 mg/d, a dose at which beta-selectivity is generally not expected to be present. The non-beta-specific bucindolol or carvedilol may ultimately be preferred to metoprolol because they are better tolerated initially due to a slight vasodilatation effect. Initial studies with carvedilol showed remarkable promise in reducing mortality. However, these agents cannot yet be said to have been studied adequately.", 
    "292": "Restenosis remains the principal limitation of coronary angioplasty; its main mechanisms are neointimal hyperplasia and vascular remodeling. The endothelium destroyed at angioplasty will progressively recover the denuded zone. However, dysfunction of this neo-endothelium persists for quite a period and may participate in restenosis by influencing these two components (hyperplasia and remodeling). Several therapeutic strategies are under evaluation to try and accelerate the regeneration of the endothelium and make it functional more rapidly. Increasing available nitric oxide (NO) decreases the hyperplasia and improves endothelial function. Growth factors accelerate the endothelial regeneration and improves its function: the effect on hyperplasia depends on the growth factor used. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors decrease hyperplasia by improving endothelial function. These therapeutic strategies merit evaluation in the clinical setting.", 
    "293": "From the vascular point of view, cardiac failure is characterised by increased systemic resistances secondary to an increased concentration of a number of vasoconstrictor substances and also to decreased endothelium dependent vasodilatation. Endothelial dysfunction has been described both in man and in animal models, but its causes are not well understood. Such dysfunction could be due to a decrease in the production of nitric oxide, a decrease in its vasodilator effect due to an increased degradation or an increased vasoconstrictor tone. Recent data suggests an improvement or prevention of this endothelial dysfunction observed in cardiac failure by physical training and by chronic treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The improvement or preservation of endothelial function induced by exercise or ACE inhibitor could explain some of the benefits of these treatments in terms of tissue perfusion and haemodynamic conditions.", 
    "294": "Intracoronary injection of acetylcholine leads to coronary vasodilatation in normal subjects and vasoconstriction in hypertensive subjects, suggesting an abnormality of endothelial function in hypertension. In order to study the response to physiological stimulation which induces endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, the effects of sympathetic stimulation (cold pressor test) and of the increase in flow velocity in the left anterior descending artery were analysed in 10 control and 26 hypertensive subjects. All had angiographically normal coronary arteries and normal lipid profiles. None of the subjects were smokers or diabetic. During the cold test (12 patients), the flow velocity increased by 47 +/- 26% (p < 0.05) in controls and by 68 +/- 48% (p < 0.01) in the hypertensives. Dilatation of the coronary arteries was observed in controls (+12.0 +/- 4.5%, p < 0.001) and constriction in the hypertensives (-10.3 +/- 8.5%, p < 0.001). Injection of papaverine in the distal left anterior descending artery (14 patients) induced proximal dilatation in controls (+17.0 +/- 10.6%, p < 0.001) and was ineffective in hypertensives (-0.4 +/- 1.5%), whereas the flow velocity increased by 521 +/- 129% and 406 +/- 120% (p < 0.001) respectively. Intracoronary injection of 2 mg of isosorbide dinitrate induced comparable dilatation in control subjects (+30.0 +/- 12.9%, p < 0.001) and in the 26 hypertensives (+22.8 +/- 6.5%, p < 0.001). In 10 hypertensive patients, intravenous injection of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindoprilat, immediately re-established the vasodilatory response to these two stimuli. The authors conclude that the coronary responses to physiological stimuli (sympathetic stimulation, increase in flow velocity) are altered in hypertensive subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries with no other risk factors. Normal vasomotion may be restored by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "295": "Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a novel 52 amino acid peptide with a potent vasodilator effect. Gene expression of ADM is found in human kidney but the exact cell source in the kidney is uncertain. Its plasma level is raised in association with changes in sympathetic nervous activity and body fluid volume in hypertension and chronic renal failure. Herein, we examined the presence of mRNA encoding for ADM in cultured human glomerular cells. Adrenomedullin in cell culture supernatant was measured by a radio-immunoassay (with a detection level of 3.2 pmol/l). Adrenomedullin mRNA was found in cultured mesangial and glomerular epithelial cells as well as in vascular endothelial cells. Supernatant levels of ADM for cultured mesangial and glomerular epithelial cells were 21.2 and < 3.2 pmol/l respectively. Contrary to vascular smooth muscle cells, the gene expression for ADM in mesangial cells was up-regulated when incubated with increasing concentration of TNF-alpha or fetal bovine serum (FBS) but this effect was not observed with very high concentration. Parallel results were observed in adrenomedullin levels in supernatant from mesangial cell cultures. Forskolin, captopril, or TGF-beta had no effect on the transcription or synthesis of ADM in mesangial cells. The gene expression for ADM in glomerular epithelial cells was down-regulated when incubated with increasing concentration of TNF-alpha, forskolin or FBS. The ADM levels in all supernatant from resting glomerular epithelial cell cultures were < 3.2 pmol/l. Recent murine data show that ADM stimulates the release of cAMP but suppresses mitogenesis in cultured mesangial cells. Our results suggest ADM is synthesized by mesangial cells in an autocrine fashion and the peptide may potentially be involved in intra-renal blood pressure control.", 
    "296": "MDL 100,240, a dual inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), was administered intravenously to two panels of four healthy males in a four-period, dose-increasing (0, 1.56, 6.25, and 25 mg, and 0, 3.13, 12.5, and 50 mg, respectively) double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Plasma ACE activity and blood-pressure response to exogenous angiotensin I and angiotensin II i.v. challenges and safety and tolerance were assessed over a 24-h period. MDL 100,240 induced a rapid, dose-related, and sustained inhibition of ACE (>70% over 24 h at doses > or =12.5 mg). The time integral of ACE inhibition was related to the dose but with near-maximal values already attained at doses > or =12.5 mg. Systolic and diastolic blood-pressure responses to exogenous angiotensin I challenges were inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the effects of angiotensin II remained unaffected. Mean supine blood pressure decreased transiently (3 h) at doses > or =3.125 mg and < or =24 h with the 25- and 50-mg doses, but not significantly. MDL 100,240 was well tolerated. In healthy subjects, MDL 100,240 exerts a dose-dependent and long-lasting ACE-blocking activity, also expressed by the inhibition of the pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I challenges. The baroreceptor reflex, assessed by the response to exogenous angiotensin II challenge, remains unaltered.", 
    "297": "The antihypertensive and metabolic effects of a fixed combination of very low dose of moexipril (MO), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were tested in a multicenter, placebo (PBO) controlled, double-blind, parallel study of men (M) and women (W) with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After 4 weeks of PBO treatment, 223 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95-114 mm Hg and sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) < or =200 mm Hg, inclusive, were randomized to PBO (114 patients: M, 56; W, 58) and MO/HCTZ 3.75/6.25 mg (109 patients: M, 58; W, 51) given once daily and followed up for 12 weeks. The fixed combination MO/HCTZ, 3.75/6.25 mg, reduced SSBP/SDBP -7.6/-7.6 mm Hg (M, -8.5/-8.0; W, -6.3/-7.0), versus PBO, +0.2/-3.9 mm Hg (M, -1.9/-3.4; W, +1.1/-4.4); p < 0.05. Also, 54% of patients receiving MO/HCTZ, 3.75/6.25 mg/day, had good blood pressure response (SDBP < or =90 mm Hg, or > or =10 mm Hg decrease from baseline), versus 28% for PBO (p < 0.001). The clinical and metabolic side effects were minor and not different between MO/HCTZ and PBO. The results of this study indicate (a) a once-daily very low dose fixed combination of MO/HCTZ is effective and well tolerated by men and women with mild to moderate essential hypertension; (b) it is almost devoid of clinical and metabolic side effects; and (c) the safety profile was similar in men and women.",

We identified all individuals who had started their first recorded therapies with an ulcer drug and another non-ulcer drug within a 100 day span. In this selected group, there would normally be an equal number starting either drug first, while a dyspepsia-provoking effect of the non-ulcer drug would manifest as an excess of individuals with the ulcer drug prescribed last. This screening method is robust to confounders that are stable over time.",

An analysis of effect modifiers suggested that the signals for corticosteroids and for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were explained by concurrent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and by underlying congestive heart failure. The signal for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be explained by the known reputation of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs for causing ulcers.",

Diuretics induced the largest (P < 0.05) drop in mean 24-hour systolic BP (-12 mmHg, P < 0.001). Atenolol reduced only its standard deviation, and nifedipine reduced only the mean daytime systolic BP (P < 0.05). The mean 24-hour diastolic BP was equally reduced by all drugs except nifedipine, which only reduced (P < 0.05) the mean daytime value. The mean 24-hour heart rate was decreased by atenolol (P < 0.001), increased by diuretics (P < 0.05), and unchanged with perindopril, while nifedipine increased (P < 0.05) only its night-time value. In conclusion, diuretics were the strongest agents in reducing systolic BP, atenolol the only agent that reduced variability, perindopril the only agent that did not affect the heart rate, and nifedipine reduced only daytime BP values.",

    "317": "At the opportunity of the 100th anniversary of S. Riva-Rocci's publications on the new sphygmomanometer the author presents a review of the main publications which made this method possible and a review of clinical and pathological studies which led to the recognition of essential hypertension (EHT). He also mentions main adopted criteria of hypertension and draws attention to the difficulties associated with a definition and classification of EHT because of the variations in pressure and differences of \"normal\" values in various populations. From multicentre intervention studies precise and generally valid criteria for individual treatment cannot be derived. As to recent of work on the pathogenesis of EHT the author draws attention to the importance of endothelin and NO (EDRF), which play a part in the genesis of changes in the vascular wall in atheromatosis and also in hypertension. A new discovery is the bond between NO and haemoglobin (S-nitrosohaemoglobin). In addition to proved and located genetic factors also external factors are involved, in particular psychosocial factors, diet, body weight, smoking etc. on which prevention and treatment must be focused. Medicamentous treatment markedly improves the prognosis of hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs from all main groups of drugs are used. Dosage still remains an open question which cannot be resolved completely on the basis of intervention trials. ACE-inhibitors hold an important place--they reduce the blood pressure and also prevent progression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Beta-blockers and diuretics still remain the basis of first line treatment. Among Ca-inhibitor, preparation with long-term action are preferred. Open questions include--apart from dosage--the comparison of the efficacy/side effects ratio of new effective drugs (A I, A II, renin) and older antihypertensive drugs when used on a long-term basis; furthermore the justification to administer vasodilatating drugs as monotherapy and in combinations during long-term treatment with regard to the activation of the sympathetic nerve and risk of hypotension. The author discusses the sympathetic activation to which BP should be reduced and thus also the question of doses reduction and discontinuation of the drug--in particular in old patients. And finally, the role of hypertension as the sole cause of increased mortality (EEHT per se) must be proved. In practice the problems of the detection rate, adherence, information and correct treatment are of major importance.", 
    "318": "Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in women, and the importance of this condition is not generally appreciated. Few studies are available that investigate the response of women to the various therapeutic agents that are used in this disease. Those that are available suggest that risk factor reduction and estrogen replacement therapy are important, and that aspirin and vitamin E may be helpful in primary prevention in women. After myocardial infarction, thrombolytics and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty reduce mortality and beta-adrenergic blocking agents and ACE inhibitors are valuable. Elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty appears to have similar success rates in men and women. In order to most effectively treat women with coronary artery disease, studies on their response to therapy are needed.", 
    "319": "This perspective study was performed to demonstrate the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy by ACE-inhibitor, ramipril, in hypertensives of recent onset. Thirty-four hypertensive patients, treated with ramipril (group I), and 32 controls who received another frequently employed drug (the calcium channel-antagonist, felodipine (group II), were evaluated. Neither of two groups received any anti-hypertensive drug and did not suffer from left ventricular hypertrophy. All selected patients underwent M-mode echocardiography for measuring the following parameters: diastolic diameter of left ventricle, (DDLV); systolic diameter of left ventricle (SDLV); inter-ventricular septum (IVS); thickness of the posterior wall (PW); and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Two anti-hypertensive drugs reduce systemic hypertension the same way. But, in hypertensives receiving ramipril (group I), the echocardiographic parameters of the left ventricle increased non-significantly. On the other hand, in those treated with felodipine (II group), these parameters significantly changed. The mechanisms of non-increase in cardiac and non-cardiac proteins, due to the ACE-inhibitors, are illustrated.", 
    "320": "During the development of cirrhosis ascites-edema, peripheral vasodilatation, hypotension and an increase of the plasma concentration of several neurohormones are frequently observed. Such complex changes in the hormonal profile hinders the assessment of the relative role of each in the pathophysiology of this disease. The purpose of this work was to evaluate in a rat model of experimental cirrhosis (phenobarbital/CCl4) the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pre-ascitic stage of the disease using the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Cirrhotic rats showed diminished renal and hepatic perfusion. Compared to normal rats, glomerular filtration rate in cirrhotic rats was reduced from 0.75 +/- 0.11 to 0.42 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g BW, and renal plasma flow was reduced from 2.37 +/- 0.28 to 1.58 +/- 0.16 mL/min/100 g BW; the indocyanine green slope changed from -0.095 +/- 0.028 to -0.057 +/- 0.01; the plasma sodium concentration fell from 144 +/- 1.5 to 131 +/- 5.40 mEq/L (all < .05). The mean arterial pressure was not reduced in the cirrhotic rats. There was no ascites. Both the acute (25 mg i.v.) and chronic (25 mg i.p. daily plus 25 mg/L in drinking water) administration of captopril to cirrhotic rats induced an increase in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow along with a steeper slope in indocyanine green decay (p < .05 for all three parameters) when compared to non-treated cirrhotic animals. No changes were observed in controls. In the balance studies, an increase in urinary volume along with a decrease in urinary osmolality was recorded in cirrhotic rats on chronic captopril treatment. In conclusion, our results show an activation of the renin-angiotensin system in these rats, as disclosed by the inhibition of the converting enzyme, as well as a possible interaction with ADH.",

Effects of clonidine and enalapril administered separately and individually were assessed for possible beneficial effects on both physiological parameters such as diurnal weight gain, urine output, and serum sodium levels and on signs of delirium as measured by neurobehavioral testing. Improvement, particularly in tests reflecting fluid consumption, was found with either or both drugs in approximately 60% of test subjects, although no behavioral improvement was demonstrated.

Measurement of left ventricular function was repeated 3 months following surgery, after recommencement of pre-surgery anti-anginal therapy for 1 week. Effects on systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during bypass were calculated from perfusion records and vasoconstrictor use during operation was documented.

Left ventricular ejection fraction 3 months after surgery did not change significantly from pre-treatment in either group (2.8 (10.7)% and 1.5 (10.1)%; quinapril and placebo, respectively). There was no first-dose hypotension (systolic BP < 100 mmHg). The intra-operative BP and the SVR during bypass in the two treatment groups were not significantly different. The ischaemic time (mean = 56 min) and the use of inotropes were the same in both groups and there was no mortality.", 
    "330": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment before coronary artery bypass graft surgery does not have a significant beneficial effect on left ventricular function following coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

    "331": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of combined administration of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan, with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), on blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Both drugs were administered continuously via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps alone or in combination for a period of 2 weeks. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were monitored throughout the infusion interval by means of chronically-implanted radiotransmitters. Coadministration of a diuretic with valsartan potentiated the blood pressure lowering effect in conscious SHR. Responses varied in magnitude from additive (valsartan at 1 mg/kg/day + hydrochlorothiazide at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day) to synergistic (valsartan at 3 mg/kg/day + hydrochlorothiazide at 10 mg/kg/day). The greater blood pressure lowering seen in SHR receiving combination therapy was associated with only a transient increase in heart rate. A similar potentiation of the antihypertensive effect was seen during coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor benazeprilat. Additivity was noted with benazeprilat at 1 mg/kg/day + hydrochlorothiazide at 3 mg/kg/day, whereas a higher dose of HCTZ resulted in a synergistic response. These findings suggest that the similar results obtained with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists are due to the capacity to which diuretic-induced activation of the renin angiotensin system occurs.", 
    "332": "The safety and efficacy of two fixed dose combinations of enalapril and diltiazem extended release formation (ER) (E/D) were compared with their monotherapies and placebo in patients with stage 1 to 3 hypertension. The trial design was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, 12 week treatment phase, followed by a 36 week, open label phase. A total of 891 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) between 95 and 115 mm Hg were randomly assigned to enalapril 5 mg, diltiazem ER 120 mg, diltiazem ER 180 mg, enalapril 5 mg/diltiazem ER 120 mg (E5/D120), enalapril 5 mg/ diltiazem ER 180 mg (E5/D180), or placebo. In the open label phase, 562 patients received the fixed combination, titrated as needed to control SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy was determined with trough (24 +/- 2 h postdose) sitting blood pressure measurements at week 12 and at the end of the open label part of the study. Safety was evaluated based on patient symptoms, clinical laboratories, and electrocardiograms (ECG). E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced trough SiDBP (-7.6 and -8.3 mm Hg, respectively; P < .05) versus their monotherapies. E5/D120 and E5/D180 significantly reduced trough sitting systolic blood pressure (-7.9 and -9.0, respectively; P < .05) versus both diltiazem ER monotherapies. All active treatments significantly decreased SiDBP and SiSBP versus placebo. E/D effectively lowered SiDBP and SiSBP during the open label extension. No significant difference was seen among treatment groups for the overall incidence of adverse events. The most common drug related adverse events were headache, edema/swelling, dizziness, asthenia/fatigue, cough, rash, and impotence. The event frequency for the combinations were similar to those seen with the monotherapies. Fixed combinations of E/D were generally well tolerated, with an increased blood pressure lowering effect as compared with the individual components in patients with stage I to III hypertension.", 
    "333": "1. Desensitization of the myocardial beta-adrenergic signal transduction pathway is an important mechanism which is involved in the progression of hypertensive heart disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differential effects of chronic pharmacotherapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, an AT1-receptor antagonist and a direct vasodilator on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy and the beta-adrenergic signal transduction. Therefore, transgenic TG(mREN2)27 (TG) rats overexpressing the mouse renin gene were used. This strain is characterized by the development of fulminant hypertension with cardiac hypertrophy. 2. Seven week old heterozygous TG(mREN2)27 rats were treated for 11 weeks with the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg kg[-1]), the ACE-inhibitor quinapril (15 mg kg[-1]) and the direct vasodilator hydralazine (30 mg kg[-1]). Untreated TG and normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats (SD) served as controls. 3. TG(mREN2)27-rats were characterized by arterial hypertension (TG 194+/-3.2 mmHg vs SD 136+/-2.9 mmHg systolic blood pressure), increased left ventricular weights (TG 4.3+/-0.3 vs SD 3.0+/-0.1 mg g(-1) body weight), decreased myocardial neuropeptide Y (NPY) concentrations (TG 1143+/-108 vs SD 1953+/-134 pg g(-1) wet weight), reduced beta-adrenoceptor densities (TG 51.1+/-1.9 vs SD 63.4+/-3.7 fmol mg[-1]) as assessed by [125I]-cyanopindolol binding studies, and increased Gi(alpha)-activities (TG 4151+/-181 vs SD 3169+/-130 densitometric units) as assessed by pertussis toxin catalyzed [32P]-ADP-ribosylation. Downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors and increased Gi(alpha) were accompanied by significantly reduced isoprenaline-, Gpp(NH)p- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Catalyst activity as determined by forskolin plus Mn2+ co-stimulation of adenylyl cyclase did not differ between TG(mREN2)27- and SD control-rats. 4. Losartan and quinapril significantly restored systolic blood pressures, left ventricular weights, beta-adrenoceptor densities, myocardial neuropeptide Y-concentrations, adenylyl cyclase activities and Gi(alpha)-activities towards the values in Sprague-Dawley-controls. No differences were observed between the effects of quinapril- and losartan-treatment. In contrast, hydralazine had only minor effects on blood pressure reduction, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and neuroeffector defects in TG(mREN2)27. 5. In conclusion, direct vasodilatation is not able to overcome the pathophysiological alterations in TG caused by transgene overexpression. In contrast, ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists, which inhibit the renin angiotensin system, equally exert beneficial effects on blood pressure, myocardial hypertrophy and neuroeffector mechanisms. Modulation of the sympathetic tone and resensitization of the beta-adrenergic signal transduction system may contribute to the special effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of the hypertensive cardiomyopathy.", 
    "334": "This study was to investigate the interaction between low doses of perindopril (2 mg daily) and amlodipine (2.5 mg daily) on ambulatory blood pressure (BP), clinic BP, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), plasma levels of renin (PRA), angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-h ANP) in subjects with essential hypertension. The study design was a parallel, two-period, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design, with 11 subjects receiving perindopril and 10 receiving amlodipine during the run-in phase. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril had no effect on ambulatory BP, whereas the addition of perindopril to amlodipine reduced both systolic (P = 0.027) and diastolic (P = 0.049) ambulatory BP. By contrast, the opposite result was obtained for clinic BP at trough, whereby the addition of amlodipine to perindopril reduced erect systolic BP (P = 0.036) and both supine and erect diastolic BP (P = 0.038) whereas the addition of perindopril to amlodipine was without effect. The addition of perindopril to amlodipine decreased serum ACE by 72% and increased PRA two-fold, without change in plasma levels of Ang II, aldosterone or alpha-h ANP. The addition of amlodipine to perindopril increased plasma aldosterone 1.7-fold but did not affect serum ACE, PRA, Ang II, or alpha-h ANP. These interactions between perindopril and amlodipine may have been conditioned by the specific effects of the therapy first given, as well as by the different circumstances of BP measurement (ambulatory vs clinic).", 
    "335": "We investigated the effects of angiotensin I (4 x 10(-9), 4 x 10(-8) and 4 x 10(-7) M) on myocardial contractility, heart rate and coronary perfusion in the isolated rat heart before and after inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by captopril (4 x 10(-4) M). We also studied the post-ischaemic recovery of cardiac function in isolated hearts subjected to global myocardial ischaemia and reperfused with various doses of angiotensin II (1 x 10(-9), 1 x 10(-8) and 1 x 10(-7) M). Angiotensin I significantly reduced coronary flow, the vasoconstrictor effect of a second identical dose was attenuated after inhibition of ACE with captopril. Angiotensin II reduced coronary flow to the same extent as angiotensin I at a concentration four times lower. Left ventricular developed pressure was reduced by angiotensin I and angiotensin II in a dose-dependent manner. Heart rate was not affected by angiotensin I and was significantly lowered by the highest doses (1 x 10(-8) and 1 x 10(-7) M) of angiotensin II. Post-ischaemic recoveries of vascular and contractile function were similar in control hearts and in hearts given angiotensin II during reperfusion. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased by the highest dose (1 x 10(-7) M) of angiotensin II throughout reperfusion compared with controls or hearts receiving lower doses (NS). In conclusion the attenuated vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin I after captopril pre-treatment confirms the existence of an intracardiac renin-angiotensin system operative in vitro. Our results also suggest that angiotensin II, at a high concentration, may play a negative role in relaxation in the ischaemic-reperfused injured heart.", 
    "336": "The present study was designed to investigate the effect of captopril, a sulfhydryl (-SH) containing ACE inhibitor and lisinopril, a non-SH containing ACE inhibitor, on ischaemia-reperfusion-induced renal injury in rats and to study the involvement of the free radical scavenging property of captopril in its renoprotective effect. Bilateral renal artery occlusion was induced for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Blood samples were taken from retro orbital sinus before surgery and at 24 h after reperfusion for blood urea and blood creatinine estimation. After completion of 24 h of renal reperfusion the carotid artery was cannulated and the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was recorded. The left kidney was used for histological examination. The right kidney was utilised for estimation of mitochondrial thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Renal ischaemia, followed by reperfusion, significantly increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and blood creatinine. However, creatinine clearance decreased markedly. Captopril administered before renal artery occlusion or immediately after reperfusion and lisinopril pre-treatment significantly attenuated the increase in BUN and blood creatinine. Creatinine clearance was markedly better in captopril-treated animals as compared to lisinopril-treated rats. Captopril significantly decreased the degree of tubular necrosis, haemorrhagic streaks and urinary casts. Lisinopril treatment decreased tubular necrosis and urinary casts but no marked effect on haemorrhagic streaks was noted. Administration of captopril before ischaemia or just after reperfusion significantly reduced the elevated concentration of mitochondrial TBARS but no such decrease was noted in lisinopril-treated rats. Based on these results it may be concluded that captopril and lisinopril markedly protected against ischaemia-reperfusion-induced renal injury and any additional renoprotective effect of captopril may be ascribed to its free radical scavenging properties.", 
    "337": "Carvedilol is a new beta-blocker antihypertensive agent with vasodilating properties secondary to alpha 1-blocking activity. Peripheral vascular resistance is reduced and cardiac output and renal function are not altered with carvedilol. The antihypertensive effects of this agent are equivalent to those of other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. Carvedilol has a neutral effect on lipids and glucose metabolism. The percentage of responders is increased when carvedilol is combined with a diuretic. This agent has several unique properties. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, carvedilol in vitro and in vivo has been shown to have antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells and to inhibit the action of oxygen-free radicals. The antioxidant properties of this compound are significantly greater than those of vitamin E. In animal models, carvedilol may slow the process of atherogenesis, reduce infarct size, and improve postinfarction survival to a greater degree than other beta-blockers. Recent studies have demonstrated that carvedilol reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure who are already receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. The antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of carvedilol may present an advantage over other available antihypertensive medications.", 
    "338": "Molecular, biochemical, and evolutionary studies indicate that somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is developmentally regulated in a tissue-specific manner. However, many important questions remain unanswered. For example, the regulatory mechanisms that control the cell- and stage-specific expression of ACE remain largely unknown. The nature, location, and role of the enzyme involved in the release of plasma membrane-anchored ACE have not been elucidated. Although the expression and localization of ACE are developmentally regulated, the physiological implications of these changes in segmental nephron differentiation remain to be elucidated. Investigations of the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the developmental co-regulation of the renin-angiotensin and Kallikrein-kinin system by ACE are a formidable challenge for future research.", 
    "339": "Considerable advances have been made in the management of heart failure during the past decade, with the development of new pharmacological agents. Now the therapeutic goals are not only to reduce symptoms but also to decrease the occurrence of acute heart failure, hospitalizations and to delay death. Prevention plays a key role: by correcting predisposing factors, and by slowing the process which leads from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to overt heart failure. The range for therapeutic action is broad: general and dietetic advices, pharmacological agents, surgical procedures which are reserved for the end-stage patient. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors remain the cornerstone of treatment at almost all stages of the disease.", 
    "340": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors increase life expectancy in congestive heart failure, and they have thus changed the therapeutic strategy. The well tolerated highest daily dosage has to be used. Diuretics are often associated with vasodilators; however, they have to be administered at a minimal chronic daily dosage, in order to avoid deleterious neurohormonal effects. Digoxin keeps a great interest, as the unique positive inotropic agent without surmortality. Nitrates associated or not with hydralazine may show an additional interesting benefit. The role of other vasodilators, namely amlodipine and losartan, in the treatment of chronic heart failure remains to be defined. New vasodilators are in development and might further increase our therapeutic possibilities against congestive heart failure.", 
    "341": "The development of diabetic microangiopathies is of decisive importance for the long-term prognosis of diabetes mellitus. For example, diabetic nephropathy is one of the the most common causes of terminal kidney failure. Primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy is best achieved by establishing good metabolic control. To ensure early pharmacological intervention of incipient diabetic nephropathy, screening for microalbuminuria is recommended at least once a year. A major element in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is a disordered microcirculation characterized by abnormal hemodynamics with elevated capillary pressure and microvascular resistance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) effectively act on these pathophysiological events by dilation of the vasa efferentia of the glomeruli. By means of videocapillaroscopy and laser doppler imaging also distinct changes in microcirculation can be detected. Investigations with these methods provided evidence that ACE inhibitors might also be useful in the primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, ACE inhibitors are useful pharmaceutical agents in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "342": "Long-term treatment with ACE-inhibitors improves left ventricular function in patients with aortic regurgitation. But how does this advantage influence capacity? Using echocardiography and spiroergometry, we investigated 13 patients before and after a 3 month treatment with cilazapril (2.5-5 mg/d). Ventricular enddiastolic diameter-index decreased from 3.5 to 3.1 cm/m2 (p = 0.005), left ventricular endsystolic diameter-index from 2.3 to 2.0 cm/m2 (p = 0.005), and wallstress from 174 to 150 dyn/cm2 (p = 0.01). Left ventricular mass was reduced by 14% to 488 g (= 253 g/m2, p < 0.05). The regurgitant jet area decreased from 10.1 to 8.1 cm2 (p < 0.05). Wall thickness, workload, and maximal oxygen intake showed no significant difference during follow-up. These results indicate that left ventricular volumes and muscle mass in patients with aortic regurgitation are positively influenced by long term ACE-inhibition, which preserves exercise capacity.", 
    "343": "Bovine lens aldose reductase (ALR2), which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), is readily inactivated by its own substrate in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Both DTT and NADP+ can prevent enzyme inactivation but neither extensive dialysis nor thiol-reducing treatment were able to restore enzyme activity once inactivation had occurred. Unlike the native enzyme, S-glutathionyl-modified ALR2 is unaffected by HNE, and can be easily reverted to the native form under thiol-reducing conditions. Evidence is presented of the involvement of Cys298 in the inactivation process. Zofenoprilat, an antioxidant thiol compound, mimics the effect of GSH. The possibility is raised that enzyme thiolation may function as a protection mechanism against the irreversible modification of ALR2.", 
    "344": "Previous work provides limited information concerning predictors of clinical deterioration after digoxin withdrawal. We investigated the association between selected baseline clinical characteristics and symptomatic deterioration in two similarly designed trials: Prospective Randomized Study of Ventricular Function and Efficacy of Digoxin (PROVED) and Randomized Assessment of Digoxin and Inhibitors of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (RADIANCE). Cox proportional-hazards analysis found the following independent predictors of worsening during follow-up in the combined PROVED and RADIANCE patients: heart failure score, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiothoracic ratio, use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, use of digoxin, and age. When these factors, except for digoxin use, were tested in the subgroup of patients withdrawn from digoxin, they all were significant independent predictors of worsening heart failure. In contrast, only use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor predicted deterioration in patients who continued digoxin. Patients with more congestive symptoms, worse ventricular function, greater cardiac enlargement, or who were not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were significantly more likely to worsen early after digoxin discontinuation than patients without these characteristics.", 
    "345": "Isothermal titration microcalorimetry has been used to measure changes in enthalpy and heat capacity for binding of lisinopril to the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) and to its apoenzyme at pH 7.5 over a temperature range of 15-30 degrees C. Calorimetric measurements indicate that lisinopril binds to two sites in the monomer of both holo- and apo-ACE. Binding of lisinopril to both systems is enthalpically unfavorable and, thus, is dominated by a large positive entropy change. The enthalpy change of binding is strongly temperature-dependent for both holo- and apo-ACE, arising from a large heat capacity change of binding equal to -2.4 +/- 0.2 kJ/K/mol of monomeric holo-ACE) and to -1.9 +/- 0.2 kJ/K/mol of monomeric apo-ACE), respectively. The negative values of deltaCp for both systems are consistent with burial of a large non-polar surface area upon binding. Although the binding of lisinopril to holo- and apo-ACE is favored by entropy changes, this is more positive for the holoenzyme. Thus, the interaction between Zn2+ and lisinopril results in a higher affinity of the holoenzyme for this drug due to a more favorable entropic contribution.", 
    "346": "We evaluated the effect of blocking angiotensin II (AngII) on the development of proteinuria and glomerular injury in antithymocyte serum (ATS) glomerulonephritis. Disease was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single intravenous injection of rabbit ATS. Three groups of rats were considered: group 1 (n = 13), ATS rats with no therapy; group 2 (n = 13), ATS rats treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (40 mg/L lisinopril in the drinking water); and group 3 (n = 13), ATS rats treated with AngII receptor antagonist (50 mg/L L-158,809 in the drinking water). Treatment started 3 hours after ATS injection and lasted 4 days. An additional group of control rats (group 4, n = 13) received preimmune serum. At day 4, ATS rats developed proteinuria (46+/-5 mg/d v control 12+/-1 mg/d; P < 0.01), which was prevented by both lisinopril and L-158,809 (14+/-0.2 mg/d and 15+/-1.6 mg/d, respectively, P < 0.01 v ATS). Systolic blood pressure was comparable in ATS rats and in controls (119+/-4 mm Hg v 120+/-2 mm Hg). Systolic blood pressure values were significantly decreased after either lisinopril or L-158,809 (104+/-3 mm Hg and 101+/-5 mm Hg, respectively; P < 0.01 v ATS). Serum creatinine levels were similar in all groups. Quantitation of proliferating cells and macrophages by analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive and ED1-positive cells/glomerular cross-section showed a marked increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in glomeruli of ATS rats over controls (12.6+/-0.5 cells/glomerular cross-section v 1.9+/-0.2 cells/glomerular cross-section; P < 0.01), which was significantly (P < 0.01) prevented by both treatments (lisinopril, 5.7+/-1.0 cells/glomerular cross-section; L-158,809, 4.8+/-1.5 cells/glomerular cross-section). The increase in ED1-positive cells (10+/-0.7 cells/glomerular cross-section v controls, 1.8+/-0.2 cells/glomerular cross-section; P < 0.01) was also significantly (P < 0.01) reduced by lisinopril and L-158,809 (4.1+/-0.7 cells/glomerular cross-sections and 2.6+/-0.6 cells/glomerular cross-section, respectively). Blocking of AngII activity prevented almost completely the formation of microaneurysms in ATS rats (percent of glomeruli with microaneurysms: ATS, 11.5%+/-3.5%; ATS + lisinopril, 0.4%+/-0.2%; ATS + L-158,809, 0.8%+/-0.8%; controls, 0%). Because AngII is a potent inducer of renal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a cytokine involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, matrix deposition, and monocyte migration (which is overexpressed in the kidney of ATS rats), we then evaluated the effect of AngII inhibitors on renal gene expression of TGF-beta1 and on urinary TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels in kidneys of ATS rats were 3.6-fold higher than those of controls and were reduced by 46% and 32% after treatment with lisinopril and L-158,809, respectively. Urinary TGF-beta1 excretion increased in ATS (37.3+/-6.0 ng/d v controls, 13.8+/-3.4 ng/d; P< 0.01) but was normalized by lisinopril and L-158,809 (7.6+/-1.9 ng/d and 6.4+/-0.4 ng/d, respectively; P < 0.01). Thus, in ATS, blocking AngII synthesis prevents proteinuria and reduces glomerular cell proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration, possibly by reducing excessive renal TGF-beta synthesis. These findings may be relevant for future strategies in the treatment of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.", 
    "347": "The administration of glucocorticoids has been reported to exacerbate proteinuria in a few patients with glomerulonephritis. This effect has not been well recognized, and the pathogenetic mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains to be clarified. In this study, we observed that a high daily oral dose (0.5 mg/kg body weight) of dexamethasone was capable of inducing overt proteinuria in mice, beginning on day 5 and persisting for a 19-day duration. One fourth of mice also intermittently presented with slight hematuria beginning on day 12. Renal lesions in the dexamethasone-treated mice, which were killed on day 23, were characterized by mild mesangial expansion, segmental or global hyalinosis/sclerosis in deep cortical glomeruli, and focal tubular changes. No glomerular inflammatory cell infiltration or proliferative lesion was noted in any of the mice. Ultrastructural features of glomeruli included mesangial widening characterized by either an increase of mesangial matrix, dilated mesangial channels filled with slightly electron-dense material or mesangial lysis-like appearance showing intracytoplasmic microcysts filled with electron-lucent material, and evidence to support injury of endothelial cells, erythrocytes, and podocytes. An immunofluorescence study revealed enhanced glomerular deposition of IgG, IgA, IgM, and fibrinogen (P < 0.001, compared with normal control mice), but no glomerular C3 deposition was identified in any of the dexamethasone-treated mice. Charge analysis showed no impairment in anionic property of glomerular tufts in the dexamethasone-treated mice. In addition, the dexamethasone-induced proteinuria was greatly attenuated by treatment with a low molecular weight heparin, although it was not reduced by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Data from these experiments suggest that a large dose of glucocorticoids is potentially nephrotoxic. Alteration of a size-dependent permeability may predominantly contribute to the dexamethasone-induced proteinuria. However, the effect of glomerular hyperfiltration may be only partially involved in the pathogenesis of this dexamethasone-induced glomerulopathy in mice.",

    "349": "To test the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers increase cardiovascular events in such patients, the incidence of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, severe heart failure, and recurrent infarction was examined in 940 patients taking calcium channel blockers and 1180 not taking them 24 hours before randomization to placebo or captopril in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Trial. All patients had an ejection fraction < or =40%. Relative risks for calcium channel blocker users versus nonusers and the 95% confidence intervals were computed with univariate and multivariate Cox regressions. Adjustments were made for differences in baseline covariates.",

In the SAVE placebo and captopril groups, the relative risks for the development of severe heart failure among the calcium channel block users versus nonusers were 0.95 and 1.23, with the 95% confidence interval of 0.72 to 1.25 and 0.88 to 1.71, respectively. A similar neutral result held for patients with and without a history of hypertension. Furthermore, calcium channel blockers did not alter the benefit of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril.",

    "352": "The objectives of this study were to assess current practice patterns in pharmacotherapy for congestive heart failure at an academic medical center and to analyze temporal trends in management of congestive heart failure from 1990 to 1995. Records of all patients discharged from the hospital in 1990 or 1995 with a primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure who also underwent echocardiography were found by a search of the hospital's medical records database. All charts were reviewed, and relevant clinical data, including all discharge medications, were recorded. On the basis of echocardiograms, patients were classified as having preserved or impaired left ventricular systolic function (estimated ejection fraction > or =45% versus <45%). The use of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium and beta-blockers, nitrates, and hydralazine in 1990 and 1995 were compared in subgroups according to left ventricular function. A total of 297 patients were identified who fulfilled study criteria and for whom all pertinent data were available (1990, n = 109; 1995, n = 188). The median age was 74 years; 37.3% of the patients were men, and 45.1% were white. Among patients with impaired systolic function, the proportion receiving either an ACE inhibitor or the combination of nitrates and hydralazine increased from 80.9% in 1990 to 95.4% in 1995 (p = 0.009). In addition, among patients treated with an ACE inhibitor, the proportion receiving an optimal dose increased from 24.3% in 1990 to 61.5% in 1995 (p < 0.001). The use of beta-blockers also increased significantly during this time period (2.1% versus 15.7%; p = 0.031 ). Among patients with preserved ventricular function, the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers increased from 1990 to 1995 (both p < 0.05). The use of other medications did not change for either subgroup. Current use of appropriate vasodilator therapy at an academic medical center is very high and is in accordance with published guidelines for the management of congestive heart failure. The use of vasodilators and beta-blockers has increased significantly since 1990 among patients with congestive heart failure with either impaired or preserved left ventricular contractility.", 
    "353": "Cerebral large arteries dilate actively around the lower limits of CBF autoregulation, mediated at least partly by nitric oxide, and maintain CBF during severe hypotension. We tested the hypothesis that this autoregulatory response of large arteries, as well as the response of arterioles, is altered in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and that the altered response reverts to normal during long-term antihypertensive treatment with cilazapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In anesthetized 6- to 7-month-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), 4- and 6- to 7-month-old SHR without antihypertensive treatment, and 6- to 7-month-old SHR treated with cilazapril for 10 weeks, local CBF to the brain stem was determined with laser-Doppler flowmetry and diameters of the basilar artery and its branches were measured through a cranial window during stepwise hemorrhagic hypotension. The lower limit of CBF autoregulation shifted upward in untreated SHR to 90 to 105 mm Hg from 30 to 45 mm Hg in WKY, and it reverted to 30 to 45 mm Hg in treated SHR. In response to severe hypotension, the basilar artery dilated by 21 +/- 6% (mean +/- SD) of the baseline internal diameter in WKY. The vasodilation was impaired in untreated SHR (10 +/- 8% in 4-mo-old SHR and 4 +/- 5% in 6- to 7-month-old SHR), and was restored to 22 +/- 10% by treatment with cilazapril (P < 0.005). Dilator responses of branch arterioles to hypotension showed similar attenuation and recovery as that of the basilar artery. The data indicate that chronic hypertension impairs the autoregulatory dilation of the basilar artery as well as branch arterioles and that antihypertensive treatment with cilazapril restores the diminished dilation toward normal.", 
    "354": "The formation of the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II (AII) is dependent on the sequential action of two enzymes, renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), on the substrate angiotensinogen. Although the renin-producing cells of the kidney do not express angiotensinogen, they contain large amounts of AII in the same storage granules that contain renin. When renin expression is suppressed in these cells, AII also disappears. In the current study, we have tested whether the renin-associated disappearance of AII in renal juxtaglomerular (JG) cells is due to a renin-dependent down-regulation of granule biosynthesis and whether receptor-mediated internalization of AII could account for its concentration in these cells. Our results support a model whereby AII peptides are generated within JG cells, presumably by a mechanism which involves the action of endogenous renin on internalized, exogenous angiotensinogen.", 
    "355": "An enhanced, sensitive GC-MS assay is presented for the highly specific angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. This method improves previously published assays by using solid NEM as stabilizer in the collection tubes, a rapid extraction technique with dichloromethane and back-extraction into base, a commercially available internal standard (thiosalicylic acid) and a capillary GC column. Captopril and the internal standard are measured as their bis-pentafluorobenzyl derivatives. The assay was linear from 10 to 5000 ng/ml with a mean recovery following solvent extraction at 50, 200 and 1000 ng/ml of 77%. At mean values of 45.9, 187 and 980 ng/ml inter-assay precision and accuracy were 4.0, 2.9 and 3.5% and 8.2, 6.5 and 3.1%, respectively. Analysis of captopril concentrations in plasma samples from 20 volunteers following oral administration of 100 mg of captopril provided the following pharmacokinetic data (mean+/-S.D.): Cmax, 1470+/-467 ng/ml; AUC(0-infinity), 1736+/-481 ng/ml.h; Tmax, 0.73 h; k(e), 0.468+/-0.122 h(-1); elimination half life, 1.58/-0.41 h.", 
    "356": "Abnormalities of renal autoregulation with glomerular hyperfiltration and raised intraglomerular pressure have been suggested as important factors in the initiation and development of diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition appears to have a specific reno-protective role in diabetic nephropathy, possibly by reducing intraglomerular pressure. The acute effects of ACE inhibition on renal haemodynamics in normotensive, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have not been previously reported. We measured simultaneous glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) in 29 (4 female) subjects, mean age 52 years (range 27-70), using 51Cr EDTA and 125I Hippuran. Clearances were corrected to 1.73 m(-2). All patients were normotensive (blood pressure < 75th centile for age and sex), newly diagnosed (< 30 days), taking no antihypertensive or hypoglycaemic medication. Subjects were randomly allocated (double blind) to receive the ACE inhibitor trandolapril 4mg day(-1) (H) (hypotensive dose), trandolapril 0.5 mg day(-1)(L) (non-hypotensive dose) or placebo (P) for 10 days after which renal haemodynamics were remeasured. For all subjects baseline GFR, RPF and filtration fraction (FF) were 97+/-21 ml min(-1) mean+/-SD, 439+/-120 ml min(-1) and 22.3+/-2.9 % respectively. Glomerular hyperfiltration (GFR> 120 ml min[-1]) was only demonstrated in 3 subjects (10.3 %). In group H mean arterial pressure (103+/-8 vs 93+/-9 mmHg, p < 0.001) and FF (23.8+/-2.3 vs 20.0+/-4.0%, p = 0.03) fell while RPF increased (376+/-111 vs 426+/-60 ml min(-1), p = 0.02), there was no significant change in GFR. No significant change in mean arterial pressure, GFR, RPF or FF occurred in groups P and L. These studies suggest that in newly diagnosed normotensive NIDDM subjects normal renal autoregulation occurs and glomerular hyperfiltration is uncommon.", 
    "357": "An intrinsic angiotensin system has been described in the pancreas, with angiotensin II specific receptors being present on both exocrine, endocrine and vascular cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of angiotensin II on insulin secretion and blood flow regulation in the pancreas. Blood flows were determined with a microsphere technique. Infusion of angiotensin II induced a dose-dependent reduction in both whole pancreatic and islet blood flow, which was most pronounced in the former. Administration of enalaprilate, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and saralasin, a nonselective angiotensin II receptor antagonist, preferentially increased islet blood flow. The effects of angiotensin II on insulin release were examined by measuring insulin concentrations in the effluents from isolated perfused pancreata. In these preparations, enalaprilate affected neither basal nor glucose-stimulated insulin release, whereas angiotensin II delayed the first phase of insulin release in response to glucose. The effect of angiotensin II was probably due to initial marked vasoconstriction. The retardation of insulin release could be avoided by adding angiotensin II to the perfusion medium 20 min before glucose administration, i. e. so that the vasoconstriction had disappeared when glucose-stimulation began. The present study suggests that the angiotensin-system is important in regulation of islet blood flow and points to a pivotal role of islet blood perfusion for an adequate insulin release.", 
    "358": "Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediates the vasoconstrictive and growth-promoting effect of angiotensin II in humans. It has been reported that a polymorphism of the AT1 gene (an A/C transversion at position 1166: A-C1166) occurs more frequently in resistant hypertensives taking two or more antihypertensive drugs. On the contrary, a recent study of the influence of the A-C1166 polymorphism on aortic stiffness demonstrated that the distribution of the genotypes did not differ between normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In addition, a recent population-based survey of Caucasian hypertensives reported lower blood pressure values in CC homozygotes than in heterozygotes and AA homozygotes. Because of these controversial results and the lack of a sufficient amount of data the present study was designed to assess the contribution of the AT, gene A-C1166 polymorphism to resistant essential hypertension. Forty-eight subjects with resistant essential hypertension (HT) and 48 normotensive (NT), age and sex-adjusted controls (from a population of 300 healthy blood donors) were selected. All subjects were genotyped for the A-C1166 polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of the AT1 gene using PCR-based techniques. The influence of genotype on blood pressure (BP) was investigated using ANOVA Randomized Complete Block (ANOVA RCB) design according to sex, age and BMI. There were no significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between HT and NT subjects (X2 = 0.61; P = NS). In HT subjects higher values of systolic blood pressure were associated with the C allele of the AT1 gene only in older and overweight patients (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Also in HT patients an association between the presence of the C allele of the AT1 gene and higher values of diastolic blood pressure was present in overweight patients (P = 0.001). These results suggest that in resistant hypertensive subjects the AT1 A-C1166 polymorphism is potentially involved in the regulation of blood pressure. As the effects of genotypes on blood pressure are pronounced in older and overweight subjects this polymorphism may amplify the effects of age and BMI on resistant essential hypertension.", 
    "359": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of bradykinin in the inhibitory action of captopril in hypertension induced by L-NAME in anesthetized rats. Male Wistar rats (260-320 g) were anesthetized with chloralose and arterial blood pressure was recorded with a polygraph pressure transducer. The hypertensive effect of L-NAME was studied in rats pretreated with saline, captopril or HOE 140 plus captopril. The effect of captopril was also studied during the sustained pressor effect of L-NAME. The acute pressor effect of L-NAME (10 mg/kg, i.v.) was significantly reduced by i.v. pretreatment with 2 mg/kg captopril (delta increase of 49 +/- 4.9 mmHg reduced to 20 +/- 5.4 mmHg, P = 0.01). The pressor effect of L-NAME (delta increase of 38 +/- 4.8 mmHg) observed in rats pretreated with captopril and HOE 140 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) was not significantly different from that induced by L-NAME in rats pretreated with saline (P = 0.09). During the sustained pressor effect induced by L-NAME (delta increase of 49 +/- 4.9 mmHg) captopril induced a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in arterial blood pressure (delta decrease of 22 +/- 3.0 mmHg). The present results demonstrate that the acute pressor effect of L-NAME is reduced by captopril and this inhibitory effect may be partly dependent on the potentiation of the vasodilator actions of bradykinin.", 
    "360": "A new metalloendopeptidase was purified to apparent homogeneity from a homogenate of normal human brain using successive steps of chromatography on DEAE-Trisacryl, hydroxylapatite and Sephacryl S-200. The purified enzyme cleaved the Gly33-Leu34 bond of the 25-35 neurotoxic sequence of the Alzheimer beta-amyloid 1-40 peptide producing soluble fragments without neurotoxic effects. This enzyme activity was only inhibited by divalent cation chelators such as EDTA, EGTA and o-phenanthroline (1 mM) and was insensitive to phosphoramidon and captopril (1 microM concentration), specific inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1), respectively. The high affinity of this human brain endopeptidase for beta-amyloid 1-40 peptide (Km = 5 microM) suggests that it may play a physiological role in the degradation of this substance produced by normal cellular metabolism. It may also be hypothesized that the abnormal accumulation of the amyloid beta-protein in Alzheimer's disease may be initiated by a defect or an inactivation of this enzyme.",

    "366": "The concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increases during chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors for unknown reasons. We investigated whether alterations in ACE mRNA and ACE concentration occur in the different tissues during ACE inhibition and the role of angiotensins in these regulations by comparing ACE inhibitors with other blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, in the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg/day in rats induced dose- and time-dependant increases in plasma ACE up to two to three times control values. There were significant increases in the steady state ACE mRNA in the lung (32%), duodenum (64%) and aorta (324%) and 40% to 140% increases in membrane-bound enzyme concentration in these tissues and in the heart and kidney. The ACE content of purified duodenal brush border was increased by 80%, but the enzyme and its mRNA in the testis were not altered. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan at several regimens of up to 30 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days produced no change in plasma ACE level or lung ACE mRNA. The human renin inhibitor ciprokiren was tested in guinea pigs, a species sensitive to this compound. Both enalapril and cilazapril induced 2-fold increases in plasma ACE, but ciprokiren (24 mg/kg/day for 12 days) had no effect. Enalapril treatment of BN/Kat rats (lacking circulating kininogens) caused a similar increase in ACE as in other rats. This study documents a general increase in ACE gene expression and enzyme concentration in tissues during ACE inhibition, with the exception of the testis, most probably reflecting an activation of the 5', so-called somatic promoter of the ACE gene. Angiotensins are not involved in this regulation and do not seem to control ACE gene expression in normal rodents.", 
    "367": "Dual angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors, by decreasing angiotensin-II production and by preventing the degradation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), may be useful for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The thiol dipeptide CGS 30440 (prodrug of CGS 30008, IC50: ACE/NEP = 19/2 nM) administered to rats (10 mg/kg p.o.) inhibited lung tissue ACE activity by 98% and 61% at 1 and 24 hr (P < .001) and inhibited the angiotensin-I pressor response by 75 to 90% for more than 6 hr. Renal tissue NEP activity was reduced by 80% at 1 hr and 73% at 24 hr (P < .001). In rats supplemented with exogenous ANP, CGS 30440 (1 mg/kg p.o.) elevated the concentration of circulating ANP (133%, P < .025) for 4 hr and increased the excretion of urine (300%, P < .001), sodium (194%, P < .025) and cyclic GMP (238%, P < .005). CGS 30440 (10 mg/kg p.o.) administered to hypertensive rats with aortic ligation between the renal arteries (mean arterial blood pressure, 209 +/- 4 mm Hg) produced a 48 mm Hg blood pressure reduction (P < .001) within 4 hr. CGS 30440 given to cynomolgus monkeys at 2 mg/kg inhibited plasma ACE activity by 96% within 1 hr (P < .001), and this inhibition was maintained for 7 and 21 days in monkeys receiving the compound orally at 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. These studies demonstrate that CGS 30440 is an orally active agent which produces tissue ACE and NEP inhibition in rats and plasma ACE inhibition in primates and suggest that the compound may be useful in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.",

S 21402-1 [(2S)-2-[(2S,3R)-2-thiomethyl-3-phenylbutanamido] propionic acid] is a sulfhydryl-containing potent inhibitor of both NEP (Ki = 1.7 nM) and ACE (Ki = 4.5 nM). S 21402-1 and the sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor captopril were administered to rats by intraperitoneal injection (0, 0.3, 3, 30, 300 mg/kg). Urine was collected for 4 h; then plasma and kidneys were collected. The difference in NEP and ACE inhibition by S 21402-1 in vivo was greater than 1000-fold. All doses of S 21402-1 inhibited NEP, as indicated by plasma NEP activity, radioinhibitor binding to kidney sections, urinary sodium excretion and bradykinin-(1-7)/bradykinin-(1-9) ratio. However, only 300 mg/kg S 21402-1 inhibited ACE, as indicated by plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio, renin and angiotensinogen levels. Although S 21402-1 (30 and 300 mg/kg) inhibited renal NEP, as indicated by the bradykinin-(1-7)/bradykinin-(1-9) ratio in kidney, S 21402-1 had no effect on renal ACE, as indicated by the angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio in kidney. Moreover, captopril was greater than 10-fold more potent than S 21402-1 as an ACE inhibitor in vivo. In separate experiments, the pressor response of anesthetized rats to angiotensin I showed more rapid decay in ACE inhibition by S 21402-1 than by captopril. These studies indicated that in vivo modification of S 21402-1 caused a much greater decrease in potency of ACE inhibition than NEP inhibition. Consequently, effective ACE inhibition by S 21402-1 required doses much higher than those required for NEP inhibition.", 
    "369": "The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is an ongoing intervention study conducted in 11,019 hypertensive patients in Sweden and Finland. Patients have been randomized to receive either conventional antihypertensive therapy (diuretics and/or beta-blockers) or captopril-based treatment. A prospective, randomized, open, blinded-endpoint evaluation (PROBE) study design is used to compare these two therapeutic regimens as regards cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The rationale for the CAPPP Study are the many observations of beneficial effects of ACE inhibition, as compared to diuretics and beta-blockers, on intermediary endpoints such as insulin sensitivity, serum lipoproteins, left ventricular hypertrophy and renal function. Captopril has also been shown to be markedly effective in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction as well as congestive heart failure. The hypothesis is that these differences might result in improved risk reduction when ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension. The present paper describes the baseline data and the changes in blood pressure during the first year in the total cohort. During the first year the average blood pressure was reduced by 11/8 mm Hg. A number of substudies have been conducted in the CAPPP Study. In one of these insulin sensitivity was compared in a subgroup of the patients using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. In another substudy the ACE gene was sequenced and some new polymorphisms were discovered. Several other substudies are in progress or in the planning phase.

The increase in well-being from baseline to 6 months was significant in target groups < or =80 mmHg (p < 0.01) and < or =85 mmHg (p < 0.05). The SSA-P domains, cardiac symptoms and dizziness improved in all groups but the sex life score deteriorated in the < or =80 and < or =85 mmHg groups in male patients.

Group 1 (control), group 2 (felodipine, 30 mg x kg(-1) x d[-1]), group 3 (enalapril, 30 mg x kg(-1) x d[-1]), and group 4 (felodipine plus enalapril, 15 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) each agent) were studied after 3 weeks of treatment without L-NAME. L-NAME (50 mg/L) cotreatment was administered in drinking water to groups 6 through 10 using the same doses of each agent as in groups 1 through 4: group 5 (only L-NAME), group 6 (felodipine), group 7 (enalapril), and group 8 (felodipine plus enalapril). Groups 9 and 10 received L-NAME initially for 3 weeks followed by felodipine or felodipine plus enalapril, respectively, for the subsequent 3 weeks. All three treatments resulted in reductions in mean arterial pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance (P<.001) that were associated with important structural and functional renal microcirculatory improvements. Thus, the pathological nephrosclerosis (subcapsular and juxtamedullary) glomerular and arteriolar injury scores were improved (P<.05 at least) in association with normalization of afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances, and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate, plasma flow, and blood flow were significantly improved, as well as the ultrafiltration coefficient (compared with group 5, L-NAME). Thus, the calcium antagonist felodipine, alone or in combination with an ACE inhibitor, not only prevented but also reversed L-NAME-exacerbated hypertensive nephrosclerosis in SHR.",

The goal of the present study was to define potential mechanisms for these effects by measuring left ventricular function, hemodynamics, and neurohormonal system activity in a model of CHF in which amlodipine treatment had been instituted either as a monotherapy or in combination with ACE inhibition. Thirty-two pigs were instrumented to allow measurement of cardiac index, total systemic resistance index, and neurohormonal activity in the conscious state and assigned to one of four groups: (1) rapid atrial pacing (240 bpm) for 3 weeks (n = 8), (2) amlodipine (1.5 mg x kg(-1) x d[-1]) and pacing (n = 8), (3) ACE inhibition (fosinopril 1.0 mg/kg BID) and pacing (n = 8), and (4) amlodipine and ACE inhibition (1.0 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) and 1.0 mg/kg BID, respectively) and pacing (n = 8). Measurements were obtained in the normal control state and after the completion of the treatment protocols. With rapid pacing, basal resting cardiac index was reduced compared with control values (2.7+/-0.2 versus 4.7+/-0.1 L x min(-1) x m(-2), respectively, P<.05) and increased from rapid pacing-only values with either amlodipine or combination therapy (3.7+/-0.3 and 4.4+/-0.5 L x min(-1) x m(-2), respectively, P<.05). Basal resting total systemic resistance index was higher in the rapid pacing-only group compared with control values (2731+/-263 versus 1721+/-53 dyne x s x cm(-5) x m2, respectively, P<.05), was reduced with either amlodipine treatment or ACE inhibition (2125+/-226 and 2379+/-222 dyne x s x cm(-5) x m2, respectively, P<.05), and was normalized with combination therapy. Plasma catecholamines, renin activity, and endothelin levels were increased threefold with rapid pacing. Amlodipine, either as a monotherapy or in combination with ACE inhibition, did not result in increased plasma catecholamines and renin activity compared with the rapid pacing-only group. Furthermore, combination therapy reduced steady state norepinephrine and normalized epinephrine levels. The results of the present study demonstrated that monotherapy with either amlodipine or ACE inhibition provides beneficial effects in this pacing model of CHF. Combined amlodipine and ACE inhibition provided greater benefit with respect to vascular resistance properties and neurohormonal system activity compared with either monotherapy.",

We compared the effects of inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme or blockade of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors in a model with renin-induced hypertension that is known to exhibit similar changes in sympathetic activation and beta-adrenergic desensitization, as observed in heart failure. Treatment with captopril (100 mg/kg of feed) or the AT1-antagonist Bay 10-6734 (100 mg/kg of feed) was performed in transgenic rats harboring the mouse renin 2d gene [TG(mREN2)27]. Neuropeptide Y and angiotensin II levels, adenylyl cyclase activity, beta-adrenergic receptors, G(salpha), and G(ialpha) were investigated. TG(mREN2)27 showed a depletion of myocardial neuropeptide Y stores and an increase in myocardial angiotensin II concentrations. Isoprenaline- and guanylylimidodiphosphate-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities and beta-adrenergic receptor density were reduced, whereas the catalyst and G(salpha)-function were unchanged. G(ialpha) protein and mRNA concentrations were increased. All alterations were normalized by both treatments. Systolic left ventricular pressures, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, and myocardial steady state atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA concentrations and heart weights were similarly reduced by both treatments. Sympathetic neuroeffector defects are similarly reversed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or AT1 antagonism. The data support the concept that pharmacological interventions in the myocardial renin-angiotensin system significantly reverse local sympathetic neuroeffector defects. This could be important for the beneficial effects of these agents.",

Given a realization of this process, we assume that the binary responses are conditionally independent, with the probability that a subject responds positively at any given time t depending on the value of the underlying process at that time and also on any covariates specific to the subject at that time.

Neither nifedipine nor diltiazem increased nitrite production at any dose studied. In marked contrast, amlodipine caused a dose-dependent increase in nitrite production from 74+/-5 to 130+/-8 pmol/mg (by 85+/-21%,10(-5) mol/L, P<.05) that was similar in magnitude to that of either of the ACE inhibitors. Amlodipine also increased nitrite production in large coronary arteries and in aorta. N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, HOE-140, and dichloroisocoumarin essentially abolished the increase in nitrite production, indicating that (1) nitrite production reflected NO formation, (2) nitrite production was dependent on stimulation of the kinin2 receptor, and (3) nitrite production is most likely secondary to the formation of local kinins.",

Our aim was to assess the acute effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin II AT1-subtype receptor blockade in pig heart. Five groups of open-chest pigs received 1 hour of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion and 2 hours of reperfusion. Left ventricular pressure was monitored by an intraventricular catheter, and regional segment shortening (%SS) in the LAD-supplied territory was measured by ultrasonic crystals implanted in the subendocardium. Group 1 (n = 6) served as the control; groups 2 (n = 6) and 3 (n = 6) received the angiotensin II receptor blocker, EXP 3174 (C22H21Cl1N6O2), and the ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat, respectively, prior to LAD occlusion; group 4 (n = 6) was preconditioned with two cycles of 10 minutes of coronary occlusion and 30 minutes of reperfusion; and group 5 (n = 6) underwent preconditioning with additional administration of EXP 3174 prior to the 60-minute occlusion period. Infarct sizes were measured by p-nitrobluetetrazolium staining and were expressed in percent of the ischemic area of risk. The angiotensin II receptor blocker EXP 3174 and enalaprilat reduced infarct sizes significantly (35.3 +/- 17.1% and 40.1 +/- 15.1%, respectively) compared with controls (71.2 +/- 12.8%, P < 0.05), and EXP 3174 augmented the infarct size-limiting effects of preconditioning by ischemia (10.5 +/- 6% vs. 28.6 +/- 5.3%, P < 0.05). Regional contractile dysfunction during reperfusion demonstrated no changes after angiotensin II receptor blockade. Angiotensin II receptor blockade reduced infarct size comparable with that obtained with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition.

    "388": "To investigate the concept of initiating therapy with low doses of a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor, a fixed combination of isradipine 2.5 mg plus the ACE inhibitor spirapril 3 mg was compared with its components, with the full-dose monotherapies (isradipine 5 mg or spirapril 6 mg), and with placebo. After a 2-week wash out phase in pretreated patients and a subsequent 2-week placebo period, 405 patients with a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 100 and 114 mmHg were randomly allocated to 12-week once-daily double-blind treatment in one of the six treatment arms. In patients whose blood pressure was not normalized (defined as DBP< or =90 mmHg) after 6 weeks of treatment, the dosage of either medication was doubled or, in the placebo group, was switched to the fixed combination. After week 6, the mean reductions from baseline in sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure 24 hours after dosing (trough) for the fixed combination or the monotherapies isradipine 5 mg, isradipine 2.5 mg, spirapril 6 mg, spirapril 3 mg, and placebo were 10.4/8.7, 10.0/9.4, 6.5/6.7, 10.0/8.3, 7.0/5.8, and 2.2/4.7 mmHg, respectively. The blood pressure changes obtained with the low-dose fixed combination were essentially identical to those observed with the full-dose monotherapies, thus showing an additive effect of low-dose isradipine and spirapril. In terms of tolerability, the lowest rate of any adverse events was found in the combination group. In this group, typical adverse events of calcium antagonists, such as headache, flushing, ankle edema, or palpitations, were observed only in 5%, 2%, 1%, and 0%, respectively, dry cough, considered typical for ACE inhibitors, was observed in only 1% of the combination group. In conclusion, the low-dose components isradipine 2.5 mg and spirapril 3 mg were shown to have an additive effect when combined, exerting a blood pressure-lowering effect comparable with the full doses and a trend to a better tolerability profile in comparison with the standard doses. Thus, low-dose combination therapy with these drugs appears to be a rational alternative to conventional monotherapy in the first-line treatment of hypertension.",

    "390": "RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM AND HYPERTENSION: The renin-angiotensin system is integral to the mechanisms that sustain hypertension. Hypertensive patients with inappropriately high renin levels have an increased risk of cardiovascular events, and thus there is continuing interest in treating hypertension with drugs that not only reduce blood pressure but also have an inhibitory effect on the renin-angiotensin system. INHIBITORS OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease blood pressure and ameliorate the symptoms of congestive heart failure. Drugs that selectively block the AT1 angiotensin II receptor are now entering clinical practice for the treatment of hypertension and, very likely, congestive heart failure. PHARMACOLOGIC DIFFERENCES: There are some important theoretical differences between ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers in their actions on the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors ostensibly prevent the formation of angiotensin II. However, this action is far from complete, as measurable plasma concentrations of ACE remain during chronic therapy with these agents. AT1 receptor blockers work selectively at the AT1 receptor, leaving the AT2 receptor unaffected. The importance of this selectivity has not yet been established, but AT2 receptors are thought to mediate inhibitory effects on growth. It has been postulated that the selective blockade by this new class of drugs will directly decrease the growth-promoting actions of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, while leaving the growth-inhibitory effects of the AT2 receptor unaffected. The clinical relevance of these differing pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have not yet been established. BLOOD PRESSURE, METABOLIC AND RENAL EFFECTS: AT1 receptor blockers appear to have relatively high trough:peak efficacy ratios compared with ACE inhibitors. However, in patients with essential hypertension compared with normal volunteers, the M value, a measure of glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity, is reduced. Both the ACE inhibitor delapril and the AT1 blocker candesartan have shown a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity, and candesartan appears to restore the M value to normal. While ACE inhibitors have been shown to have strongly beneficial actions in the kidneys, comparable data are not yet available for AT1 blockers.",

Antioxidant effect of captopril is believed to be due to increase in enzymes of bodily antioxidant defense, such as glutathioneperoxidaze, glutathionereductaze, and elevation in blood levels of vitamin E and reduced glutathione.", 
    "403": "The authors studied an antianginal effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, for which purpose they used Capoten at 75 mg daily over two weeks in 24 patients with stable functional class II-III exertional angina. Capoten was shown to be capable of reducing occurrences of angina attacks as well as intakes of tablets of nitroglycerin for the above attacks to be arrested; besides, it lowers systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, enhances exercise tolerance, increase rate of circular shortening of left ventricular myocardium fibres, decreases total peripheral vascular resistance. In conclusion, apart from antihypertensive and positive inotropic action Capoten has a coranolytic effect.",

    "405": "The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, imidapril ((4S)-1-methyl-3-\u00bf(2S)-2-[N-(1S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl) amino] propionyl\u00bf-2-oxoimidazolidine-4-carboxylic acid hydrochloride), for 7 days on the cerebral blood flow autoregulatory response to hypotension in hypertensive rats. We measured the cerebral blood flow at rest and during hemorrhagic hypotension, using laser-Doppler flowmetry. At the same time, the absolute baseline cerebral blood flow values in the parietal cortex were quantified with the hydrogen clearance method. After administration of imidapril at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 7 days, the resting value of mean arterial blood pressure was significantly decreased by 25 mm Hg (P < 0.001), cerebral vascular resistance was lowered by 14.4% (P < 0.05) and the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation was shifted to a lower level, 106+/-11 mm Hg (mean +/- S.D.), from 137+/-8 mm Hg in the control group (P < 0.001), while resting cerebral blood flow remained unchanged. The present results demonstrated that imidapril preserves cerebral blood flow and significantly shifts the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation towards lower blood pressure levels.", 
    "406": "1 Characteristics of cyclic GMP- and cyclic AMP-mediated relaxation in aortic segments of rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) and the effects of chronic treatment with an angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril, were examined 8 weeks after coronary artery ligation. 2 Cardiac output indices of coronary artery-ligated and sham-operated rats were 125+/-8 and 189+/-10 ml min(-1) kg(-1), respectively (P<0.05), indicating the development of CHF at this period. 3 The maximal relaxant response of aortic segments to 10 microM acetylcholine in rats with CHF and sham-operated rats was 64.0+/-5.7 and 86.9+/-1.9%, respectively (P<0.05), whereas the relaxant response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) remained unchanged. Tissue cyclic GMP content in rats with CHF was lower than that of sham-operated rats. 4 In endothelium-intact segments of rats with CHF, the maximal relaxant response to 10 microM isoprenaline (44.5+/-6.7%) was lower that sham-operated rats (81.3+/-2.5%, P<0.05) and the concentration-response curve for NKH477, a water-soluble forskolin, was shifted to the right without a reduction in the maximal response. Isoprenaline-induced relaxation of aortic segments was attenuated by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in sham-operated rats, but not in rats with CHF. Relaxation to 30 microM dibutyryl cyclic AMP in rats with CHF (26.8+/-2.7%) was lower than that in sham-operated rats (63.4+/-11.8%, P<0.05). 5 Trandolapril (3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) was orally administered from the 2nd to 8th week after the operation. Aortic blood flow of rats with CHF (38.5+/-3.6 ml min(-1)) was lower than that of sham-operated rats (55.0+/-3.0 ml min(-1)), and this reduction was reversed (54.1+/-3.4 ml min(-1)) by treatment with trandolapril. The diminished responsiveness described above was normalized in the trandolapril-treated rat with CHF (i.e., the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine, 94.7+/-1.0%; that to isoprenaline, 80.5+/-2.8%; that to dibutyryl cyclic AMP, 54.7+/-6.2%). However, aortic segments of trandolapril-treated rats with CHF, L-NAME did not attenuate isoprenaline-induced relaxation and the tissue cyclic GMP level was not fully restored, suggesting that the ability of the endothelium to produce NO was still partially damaged. 6 The results suggest that vasorelaxation in CHF, diminished mainly due to dysfunction in endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production and cyclic AMP-mediated signal transduction, was partially restored by long-term treatment with trandolapril. The mechanism underlying the restoration may be attributed in part to prevention of CHF-induced endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "407": "1 Calcium transport activity of isolated cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) including Ca2+ uptake and release is decreased in animals with chronic heart failure (CHF) following myocardial infarction. The present study was undertaken to determine whether an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril, improves cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular function in animals with CHF following myocardial infarction. 2 CHF was induced by left coronary artery ligation in rats, which resulted in an infarction of approximately 45% of the left ventricle. Aortic flow and cardiac output index were decreased, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased 8 weeks after the operation, suggesting the development of CHF. 3 The developed force transients of cardiac skinned fibres of the rats with CHF were decreased when the skinned fibre was preloaded for 0.25-1 min with 10(-5) M Ca2+ (48-88%) and when preloaded with 10(-6) M Ca2+ and then exposed to 0.1-1 mM caffeine (45-93%). 4 The [3H]-ryanodine-binding activity in SR-enriched fractions was reduced by 23% in the CHF group. These results suggest that the amount of Ca2+ released from SR is decreased due to a reduced rate of SR Ca2+ uptake and a downregulation of the SR Ca2+-release channel. 5 Rats were treated orally with 3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) trandolapril from the 2nd to the 8th week after the coronary artery ligation. Treatment with trandolapril attenuated the reduction in aortic flow and cardiac output index and the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and improved the developed force transients of the skinned fibre of the animal with CHF without causing a reduction of infarct size. Treatment with trandolapril also attenuated the reduction in ryanodine receptor density in the viable left ventricle of the rat with CHF. 6 It is concluded that long-term treatment with trandolapril attenuates cardiac SR dysfunction in rats with CHF and that the mechanism underlying this effect is, at least in part, attributed to prevention of downregulation of Ca2+ release channel.", 
    "408": "1 In spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) we examined over a 4-week period the influence of control low sodium diet, common salt-enriched diet (sodium chloride 6% of the dry weight of the chow) and a novel mineral salt-enriched diet (potassium-, magnesium-, and l-lysine-enriched mineral salt added at a 75% higher level of 10.5% to produce the same sodium chloride concentration of 6%) on the cardiovascular effects produced by a low-dose combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (0.25 mg kg(-1) day(-1) in the food) and a calcium channel blocker felodipine (0.4 mg kg(-1) day(-1) subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump). 2 Common salt, but not the mineral salt, accelerated the development of hypertension and induced left ventricular and renal hypertrophy in SHR. Neither common salt nor mineral salt significantly affected heart rate. 3 The combination of ramipril and felodipine decreased systolic blood pressure and prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy effectively during the common salt diet without any significant effect on the heart rate. The cardiovascular effects of the drug combination were improved by the low sodium diet or by replacement of high common salt in the diet by mineral salt. 4 Responses of endothelium-intact mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the four-week study. The combination of ramipril and felodipine markedly improved the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine and enhanced the endothelium-independent vascular relaxation responses to sodium nitroprusside in SHR on control and common salt diets. Replacement of common salt in the diet by mineral salt improved the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine. The drug combination attenuated the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vascular contractile responses to noradrenaline during the common salt diet. 5 Ramipril and felodipine in combination increased plasma renin activity by 1.9-3.2 fold without affecting serum aldosterone levels. 6 Our findings suggest that the cardiovascular effect of the low-dose combination of ramipril and felodipine was maintained during high salt intake. However, salt restriction or replacement of common salt in the diet by the potassium- and magnesium-enriched mineral salt improved the cardiovascular effects of the drug combination. In the face of a high intake of sodium, a part of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of the drug combination is apparently mediated by improved endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular relaxation responses and attenuated alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vascular contractile responses.", 
    "409": "This open, non-comparative, PMS study of fosinopril (Staril) involved 12,067 hypertensive patients assessed at baseline and after two and six months of treatment; 10,791 patients provided evaluable data with 5.2 months average treatment totalling 4667 patient-years. Adverse events were reported in 24% of patients, the most common being mild-to-moderate cough (6.05%). Events considered possibly related to fosinopril were reported in 15% of patients, the frequency being lower in younger patients, males and those receiving fosinopril monotherapy. Patient well-being improved during the study. At the end of the study, most patients were taking fosinopril 10 mg once daily. Mean reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were -11.0% and -11.7%, respectively; 71.3% of patients were 'responders'. No important differences were observed between subgroups. This study found fosinopril to be effective, well tolerated in a broad range of hypertensive patients, and with no previously unrecognised adverse events reported.",

    "411": "The role of angiotensin (Ang) in neurotransmission of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing vasodilator nerves in perfused mesenteric vascular beds isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (8- and 15-week-old) and age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) was investigated. In both SHR and WKY preparations precontracted by continuous perfusion of Krebs' solution containing 7 microM methoxamine plus 5 microM guanethidine, periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS; 1 and 2 Hz) produced a frequency-dependent vasodilation, which was abolished by 100 nM tetrodotoxin and 500 nM CGRP(8-37) (CGRP receptor antagonist). The PNS-induced vasodilation in the SHR decreased with age and was smaller than that in the WKY. The neurogenic vasodilation in the SHR but not WKY was significantly inhibited by N-acetyltetradecapeptide renin substrate (RS, 100 and 500 nM), AngI (50 and 100 nM) and AngII (50 and 100 nM). The inhibitory effects of RS, AngI and AngII were abolished by the AngII receptor antagonist, [Sar1,Ile8]AngII (500 nM). The effect of RS and AngI was inhibited by captopril (5 microM) and temocapril (500 nM). AngII (100 nM) had no effect on vasodilator response to exogenously infused CGRP (100 pmol). PNS (2 Hz) of perfused mesenteric vascular beds increased the release of CGRP-like immunoreactivities (CGRP-LI) in the perfusate, which was less in 15-week-old SHR than in age-matched WKY. AngII (100 nM) significantly inhibited the neurogenic release of CGRP-LI in the SHR but not in the WKY. These results suggest that exogenous and locally converted AngII, via AngII receptors, modulates the neurotransmission of CGRP-containing vasodilator nerves by inhibiting CGRP release from the nerve.", 
    "412": "Chronic sustained hypertension leads to structural changes of the small and large arteries. These alterations consist of smooth-muscle hypertrophy, increased deposition of collagen, and \"dilution\" or destruction of elastin fibers. In addition, there may be no growth at all, but a \"rearrangement\" of vascular wall material termed \"remodeling.\" These changes serve to increase wall thickness and the media-to-lumen ratio and to decrease the external and internal diameter of the vessel--all of which contribute to increased systemic vascular resistance by the small arteries and increased impedance by the larger arteries. It has been suggested that these structural changes are an adaptive effort by the vessel to maintain a constancy of wall tension, but the end result is detrimental in that the effect is a further increase in systemic vascular resistance and blood-flow impedance, which lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and its consequences. The stimuli for these changes are stretch stimuli, mediated through stretch receptors on the arterial wall, and trophic stimuli mediated at the tissue level through the action of angiotensin II, aldosterone, and catecholamines. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, especially those with effective tissue penetration, are ideal drugs to reverse these structural changes (\"reverse remodeling\"), decrease the systemic vascular resistance, and increase the vascular compliance. These agents exert their effects through suppression, at the tissue level, of angiotensin II, aldosterone, catecholamines, endothelins (ET1, ET3), and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and through an increase in local levels of kinins, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide, which have antigrowth effects. Although this is a class effect, it appears to be stronger with those angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors providing the greatest tissue penetration.", 
    "413": "Inadequate splanchnic perfusion, detected as a low gastric intramucosal pH (pHi), in the face of normal systemic perfusion predicts an increased risk for multiple organ failure after trauma. Although the exact etiology of this low pHi is unknown, angiotensin II is thought to be an important regulator of gut perfusion during and after resuscitation from shock. The purpose of this study is to determine whether enalaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, improves gut perfusion in critically injured patients. To test this hypothesis, 18 trauma patients monitored with a nasogastric tonometer and a pulmonary artery catheter were enrolled in a prospective study. A single dose of enalaprilat, .625 mg, was given as an i.v. bolus or a 4 h infusion following systemic resuscitation. Pre- and postdrug tonometric and hemodynamic data, including cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, right ventricular end-diastolic volume index, systemic vascular resistance index, and oxygen transport variables were compared using the paired t test. Results demonstrate that pHi was significantly improved after 4 h (7.13 +/- .04 to 7.19 +/- .03, p = .03) and after 24 h compared with baseline (7.14 +/- .04 to 7.25 +/- .04, p = .04). Overall, pHi increased in 12 of 18 patients. No significant differences were observed in any of the studied hemodynamic or systemic perfusion variables including mean arterial pressure (92 +/- 4 to 87 +/- 4, p = .24) and oxygen delivery (669 +/- 33 to 675 +/- 32, p = .82). In examining the determinants of pHi, the intramucosal-arterial PCO2 difference was improved after enalaprilat administration (27 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 3 mmHg, p = .04) while no difference was observed in arterial bicarbonate (19.5 +/- .7 to 19.7 +/- .8, p = .90). Additionally, the change in pHi observed with enalaprilat correlated with predrug intramucosal-arterial PCO2 difference (r = .74, r2 = .55, p = .0005). These results demonstrate that enalaprilat improves gut perfusion as measured by gastric tonometry in critically injured patients, and that this effect appears to be independent of changes in systemic perfusion.",

    "426": "The generation of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium maintains a continuous vasodilator tone that is essential for the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure. Nitric oxide also contributes to the control of platelet aggregation and has important antiatherogenic effects. These properties are mediated by the action of constitutive nitric oxide synthase and subsequent activation by nitric oxide of soluble guanylate cyclase. Impaired release of nitric oxide occurs in most animal and human models of hypertension, contributing to the increased peripheral resistance and most likely to the development of cardiovascular complications. Antihypertensive medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and calcium channel blockers) appear to prevent the impairment of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in experimental hypertension, though in humans the data are not as clear. Reduced nitric oxide release appears therefore to be a consequence rather than a cause of high blood pressure, and the reduction in blood pressure per se is most important. In hyperlipidaemia, endothelium-dependent relaxations are reduced probably due to the inhibitory action of oxidized low-density lipoproteins on endothelium-dependent relaxations. Lipid-lowering strategies and, more recently, ACE inhibition have been demonstrated to improve nitric oxide dependent coronary vasodilation in hypercholesterolaemic patients with and without atheromatous coronary disease. Nitric oxide dependent vasodilation is also impaired in insulin- and non-insulin-dependent diabetes as well as in healthy aging. Endothelial dysfunction may be improved in non-insulin-dependent diabetes by administration of the antioxidants, supporting the hypothesis that nitric oxide inactivation by oxygen-derived free radicals contributes to abnormal vascular reactivity in diabetes.",

In the present multicenter open trial, we investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of combined antihypertensive therapy with an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and a thiazide diuretic, trichlormethiazide. A total of 466 patients with essential hypertension were treated with lisinopril alone (monotherapy group, n = 360) or with a combination of lisinopril with trichlormethiazide (combination therapy group, n = 106) for 1 year. The average blood pressure was effectively lowered to below 150/90 mmHg in both the monotherapy and the combination therapy groups throughout the study period. The average maintenance dose of lisinopril was lower when combined with thiazide than when given alone (9.8 vs. 11.5 mg/day, p < 0.001). Dry cough was the major side effect of lisinopril; no severe adverse effects were observed. The incidence of cough was not significantly different between the monotherapy group (13.1%) and the combination therapy group (11.3%). The increase in serum potassium observed in the monotherapy group was reversed by the concurrent use of the thiazide diuretic in the combination therapy group. Fasting blood glucose was significantly reduced in the monotherapy group; the reduction observed in the combination therapy group was not significant.

At baseline, LV systolic and end-diastolic pressures and end-systolic elastance were increased in the LVH group (all P < 0.01 vs. the control group). LV relaxation time constant was also prolonged (P < 0.01), suggesting impaired LV diastolic relaxation in this model of LVH. Before and after the administration of enalaprilat (0.25 mg/kg) and L-158,809 (0.30 mg/kg), LV relaxation was assessed over a wide range of LV loading conditions during vena caval occlusion. LV relaxation time constant was insensitive to load reduction in the control group, which was not affected by enalaprilat or L-158,809. In contrast, LV unloading caused a significant prolongation of the relaxation time constant in the LVH group. This load-sensitive LV relaxation abnormality was significantly improved by enalaprilat or L-158,809. These results support the concept that angiotensin II is involved in the pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction in pressure-overloaded LVH and also suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonists are potentially beneficial in the treatment of the hypertrophied heart.",

PRA was low-to-normal in 37% of the RVH patients [low-to-normal renin (LNR-) RVH group] and elevated in the remaining 63% [high-renin (HR-) RVH group]. In the LNR-RVH group, low-to-normal renin levels, by immunoreactive active renin and plasma renin concentration measurements, and a blunted response of PRA to captopril, were seen. As compared with HR-RVH, LNR-RVH patients had a longer duration of hypertension (P < 0.05), higher serum K+ (P = 0.04) and lower diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.02). However, they did not differ for the other variables, including the fall in blood pressure after correction of renal ischaemia. Although the number of bilateral stenoses was similar in the two groups, no patient in the LNR-RVH group had total renal artery occlusion compared with 53% in the HR-RVH group (P = 0.00015). The accuracy of renal vein renin indices were high enough to justify their use only in the patients with total occlusion of a renal artery. 3. Thus LNR-RVH is common in patients with longstanding hypertension without a totally occluded renal artery. Since the sensitivity of renin measurements is low, cure of hypertension would be precluded for more than one third of RVH patients, if these tests were a prerequisite for identifying RVH.", 
    "438": "1. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) have been used widely to test agents putatively capable of vascular protection. These animals present an accelerated time course of hypertension and a reduced life-span. When fed a high-sodium diet from the eighth week of life, a further acceleration in blood pressure increase is obtained, and rats start to die after 5 weeks of diet as a consequence of cerebral haemorrhage. In this model, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were repeatedly proved to prevent vascular lesions and death. Notably, this effect was independent of any hypotensive effect. On the contrary, diuretics were shown not to be equally effective. A combination of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, although known to have synergistic effects in the therapy of hypertension, has never previously been tested. 2. Our aim was to study the effects of long-term treatment with the ACE inhibitor delapril (12 mg day-1 kg-1), the thiazide-like diuretic indapamide (1 mg day-1 kg-1), and their combination (12 and 1 mg day-1 kg-1 respectively), on the survival of SHRsp rats fed a high-sodium diet from the eighth week of life onwards. The effects of the treatments on blood pressure, body weight, food and fluid intake, diuresis, proteinuria and the appearance of lesion signs and death were assessed weekly. When control rats reached 50% mortality, they were killed, together with some drug-treated rats, to compare lesions in brain and kidney. The other drug-treated rats continued treatments until 50% mortality was reached in two treatment groups. 3. All drug treatments were able to delay death significantly when compared with control rats, which reached 50% mortality after 6 weeks of salt loading. This event was preceded by a highly significant increase in proteinuria, diuresis and fluid intake that took place 3 weeks after the increase in blood pressure over the initial range. In delapril- or indapamide-treated SHRsp these changes were never seen, even when animals started to die. In the combination-treated group, a significant increase (P < 0.01) in fluid intake and diuresis, but not proteinuria, was observed from the third week of treatment onwards. 4. Treatment with delapril or indapamide did not block the progressive increase in blood pressure as observed in control animals. However, the increase in blood pressure was markedly retarded with respect to control rats. At variance with this, in combination-treated animals blood pressure levels were maintained until the end of the experiment within the 99% confidence interval initially observed in control animals. 5. Infarctual and haemorrhagic cerebral lesions were observed in 38% of control rats; no lesions were noted in brains of age-matched rats receiving a drug treatment. Kidneys from control animals presented major degenerative lesions of glomeruli and arteries, characterized by fibrinoid necrosis. This condition was absent in drug-treated animals, which presented minor signs of ischaemic lesion. Heart hypertrophy, when heart weight was expressed as a percentage of body weight, was similar in saline-, delapril- or indapamide-treated rats. At variance with this, in combination-treated animals the heart weight to body weight ratio was significantly (P < 0.01) lower than in the other groups. 6. In conclusion, the diuretic indapamide showed similar protective effects as the ACE inhibitor delapril on acute vascular lesions and survival of SHRsp. Moreover, their combination synergized in preventing heart hypertrophy consequent to longterm hypertension. This results is probably related to the enhanced diuresis and the better control of blood pressure levels selectively found in combination-treated animals.", 
    "439": "1. The crucial role played by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the cardiovascular system and the immense therapeutic potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, more recently, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, in both heart failure and post-myocardial infarction is becoming increasingly evident. Polymorphisms within the genes controlling this enzyme system are candidates for the elucidation of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and this link is both intriguing and provocative. Recently, an association between a polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene and phenotypic expression of cardiovascular disease, namely myocardial infarction, was reported. Since then, several small case-controlled studies have confirmed an association with manifestations of ischaemic heart disease or various other cardiac end-points. However, in a large prospective study the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene conferred no appreciable risk. 2. Our aim was to review the evidence that links polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene with cardiovascular disease. We searched the Medline database (1990-1997) using the key words myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme and polymorphisms and performed a search of the reference citation of relevant articles. We selected clinical studies on cardiovascular disease related to the angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype. 3. Taken together, the available evidence supports the notion that the DD-angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype adversely influences specific cardiovascular diseases but appears to do so in specific geographical areas and in particular patient subgroups. It is not yet known whether it does this through an interaction with other genes or by as yet unexplained biochemical mechanisms. 4. We should regard the current data with the angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype as an intriguing clue in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. However, the main factor against this potential benefit is that the impact of the DD genotype appears to be small and its clinical manifestations rather heterogeneous.",

In patients with preserved systolic function, electrocardiogram at rest, chest x-ray, echocardiography, digitalis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and restriction of dietary sodium and physical activity are used less often, whereas calcium channel blockers and beta blockers are given more often than to patients with reduced systolic function.", 
    "442": "The performance of rational design to maximize the structural diversity of databases for lead finding and lead refinement was investigated. Rational methods such as maximum dissimilarity methods or hierarchical cluster analysis for designing compound subsets were compared to a random approach to study their efficiency for an enhancement of the diversity of three different databases. All investigations were done based on 2D fingerprints as a validated molecular descriptor. To compare the performance of the rational selection methods to a random approach, we additionally used probability calculations. When using maximum dissimilarity-based selections, a single compound can be a member of different neighborhoods as defined by the similarity threshold value, while in hierarchical clustering each compound is assigned to only a single cluster. Therefore the relationship between the similarity threshold of the maximum diversity selection method and a 2D similarity search threshold was studied. In contrast to hierarchical clustering analysis, maximum dissimilarity selections allow to use a similarity threshold for adding a new compound to an already selected compound list. Reasonable values for this similarity threshold are presented here. More diverse subsets were designed using maximum dissimilarity selections, which cover more biological classes than using random selections. An optimally diverse subset without redundant structures containing only 38% of one original dataset was generated, where no structure is more similar than 0.85 to its nearest neighbor, but all biological classes were represented. When it is acceptable to cover only 90% of all biological targets, 3.5-3.7 times more compounds need to be selected using a random approach than in a rational design approach. Such coverage rate shows the highest efficiency of design techniques compared to a random approach. In those subsets no compound is closer than 0.70 to its nearest neighbor. Furthermore a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) is used to evaluate designed and randomly chosen subsets for a database consisting of inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. It was shown that designed subsets using maximum dissimilarity methods lead to more stable quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models with higher predictive power compared to randomly chosen compounds. This predictive power is especially high when there is no compound in the test dataset with a similarity coefficient less than 0.7 to its nearest neighbor in the training set.", 
    "443": "The 4 kDa beta-amyloid peptide that forms the amyloid fibrils in the brain parenchyma of Alzheimer's disease patients is derived from the larger integral membrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway, alpha-secretase cleaves the amyloid precursor protein within the beta-amyloid domain, releasing an extracellular portion and thereby preventing deposition of the intact amyloidogenic peptide. The release of the amyloid precursor protein from both SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 neuronal cells by alpha-secretase was blocked by batimastat and other related synthetic hydroxamic acid-based zinc metalloprotease inhibitors, but not by the structurally unrelated zinc metalloprotease inhibitors enalaprilat and phosphoramidon. Batimastat inhibited the release of the amyloid precursor protein from both cell lines with an I50 value of 3 microM. Removal of the thienothiomethyl substituent adjacent to the hydroxamic acid moiety or the substitution of the P2' substituent decreased the inhibitory potency of batimastat toward alpha-secretase. In the SH-SY5Y cells, both the basal and the carbachol-stimulated release of the amyloid precursor protein were blocked by batimastat. In contrast, neither the level of full-length amyloid precursor protein nor its cleavage by beta-secretase were inhibited by any of the zinc metalloprotease inhibitors examined. In transfected IMR-32 cells, the release of both the amyloid precursor protein and angiotensin converting enzyme was inhibited by batimastat, marimastat, and BB2116 with I50 values in the low micromolar range, while batimastat and BB2116 inhibited the release of both proteins from HUVECs. The profile of inhibition of alpha-secretase by batimastat and structurally related compounds is identical with that observed with the angiotensin converting enzyme secretase suggesting that the two are closely related zinc metalloproteases.", 
    "444": "This longitudinal study was performed in order to clarify the effects of long-term antihypertensive medication on common carotid hemodynamics. A total of 84 patients (54 males and 30 females), who had been receiving treatment with antihypertensive medications for 5 years, were enrolled in this study. The subjects' ages ranged from 62 to 74 (mean 67). They were divided into three groups: 40 were treated with diuretics only (Group D), 28 with calcium antagonists only (Group C), and 16 with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors only (Group A). Mean blood flow volume (BF) and circulation resistance (Z) at the common carotid artery were measured by an ultrasonic quantitative flow measurement system. Blood flow volume, Z, and mean blood pressure (MBP) were measured twice over a 5-year period in patients and in 49 age-matched normal controls (Group N). Annual reductions in BF (delta BF) and MBP (delta MBP), and annual increases in Z (delta Z) were calculated. Blood flow volume of Group D showed larger decreases than that of the other three groups. Circulation resistance of Group C showed smaller increases than that of Group N. Reductions of BF and Z of Group A were similar to those of Group N. Reductions of Z of Group C showed a significant correlation with delta MBP. These results indicate that calcium antagonists may have beneficial effects on common carotid hemodynamics in elderly patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "445": "A 71 year old hypertensive, non insulin-dependent diabetic patient with moderate renal insufficiency taking 500 mg/d of metformin and 5 mg/d of enalapril, developed metabolic acidosis characterized by fairly elevated anion gap, hyperchloremia, severe hyperkaliemia, normal plasma level of 3-hydroxybutyric acid, absence of ketonuria and high plasma level of lactic acid. This biochemical feature allowed us to ascribe the pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis, both to the increased plasma level of lactic acid and to the type IV renal tubular acidosis syndrome, the precipitating factor being an infection of urinary tract (as we assumed on the basis of the urine culture). The patient was dehydrated and lethargic; the ECG revealed the presence of nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia. The clinical evolution was favorable under the treatment with an infusion of isotonic saline solutions, mild alkalinizing solutions, low-dose regular insulin and antibiotics. It is likely that metformin and enalapril, regularly taken by this nephropathic patient, could have played an iatrogenic role, even if the doses were low. This case highlights the importance of complying with the contraindications of these drugs, to avoid the rare but reported life-threatening complications of metformin administration.",

    "450": "We investigated the effect of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure. The study group consisted of 24 patients with mild to moderate heart failure [13 men, mean age 67+/-7 years, mean peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) 16.3+/-2.8 ml/min/kg] and chronic atrial fibrillation (median duration 19 (1-228) months). Patients were stable on digoxin, diuretics, nitrates and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; no prophylaxis with antiarrhythmics was started after cardioversion. Cardioversion was unsuccessful in 6 patients; of the 18 patients in whom sinus rhythm was obtained 9 had a relapse of atrial fibrillation within 6 weeks after cardioversion. The remaining 9 patients with maintenance of sinus rhythm and the 15 (6+9) patients with atrial fibrillation at follow-up after 6 weeks did not differ with respect to any baseline characteristic, including age, peak VO2, duration of atrial fibrillation, echocardiographic left ventricular and left atrial dimensions, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine. In the patients with maintenance of sinus rhythm, baseline measurements were repeated at follow-up. Peak VO2 did not change significantly (16.7+/-2.8 to 17.6+/-3.3 ml/min/kg, P=0.29); also, echo parameters, atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine were not significantly affected. These results indicate that it is difficult to achieve lasting sinus rhythm through electrical cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation and mild to moderate heart failure. Moreover, in patients with maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion no significant benefit in terms of peak VO2, cardiac dimensions, and neurohumoral status is to be expected. Hence, indiscriminate cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in the setting of heart failure does not appear to be useful.", 
    "451": "The objective of this study was to assess the antihypertensive effect and the trough to peak (T:P) ratio of lisinopril and captopril, in patients with essential hypertension. After 2 weeks of placebo, 69 of 115 eligible patients had office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 90 and 114 mm Hg and daytime average DBP above 85 mm Hg during a 25-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and were randomised to receive lisinopril (20 mg once daily) or captopril (50 mg twice daily) for 4 weeks. Office and ambulatory BP were then repeated. Indices of 24-h BP and T:P ratios were calculated and compared. Both drugs significantly reduced both office and ambulatory BP. The final BP obtained with lisinopril was less than with captopril. On office measurement, 75% of the patients treated with lisinopril and 44% on captopril were controlled (P < 0.001), but responses by ABPM were not significantly different. T:P ratios calculated in all patients were 0.75 and 0.66 for lisinopril and captopril respectively, but in patients who responded to each drug the corresponding ratios were 0.78 and 0.73. In conclusion both 20 mg once-daily lisinopril and 50 mg captopril twice-daily achieve a favourable T:P ratio in patients with essential hypertension.",

The oedema was significant in the first hour and reached maximum size in the fifth hour after injection of the venom (20-600 micrograms/paw). Low doses of the venom (20-80 micrograms/paw) produced oedema which disappeared within 48 hr after injection, while at doses of 300-600 micrograms/paw, oedema was present in excess of 48 hr. Pharmacological studies suggested that P. fuscatus venom-induced oedema probably has a mechanism which is multimediated. Pretreatment of rats with a combination of cyproheptadine (5 mg/kg)-captopril (2 mg/kg)-dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) inhibited the formation of oedema (maximal swelling) produced by the venom (300 micrograms/paw) by about 79% and improved the time to recovery. Paw swellings caused by 20 and 40 micrograms/paw venom were completely eliminated by the same doses of this drug combination. The kinins, autacoids (histamine and serotonin) and lipogenase derivatives are probably involved in the venom-induced oedema.",

DNA synthesis and the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry using autopsy materials from patients with hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The hypertension group (n=10) included four men and six women aged 61+/-10 years (heart weight: 470+/-79 g, mean+/-s.d.); the cardiomyopathic group (n=10) included eight men and two women aged 61+/-23 years (heart weight: 615+/-211 g). The percentage of cells in G2M phase of the cell cycle was significantly decreased in the myocardium from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared with that from hypertensive patients (cardiomyopathy v hypertension: 1.1+/-0.6 v 7.7+/-2.6%, mean+/-s.d.). Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered for 12 months to patients with hypertension (n=20) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=15). Regression of cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by echocardiography. Long-term administration of captopril achieved regression of cardiac hypertrophy in the hypertensive patients, but not in the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the hypertensive patients, the left ventricular mass was 234+/-9 g before treatment and 198+/-26 g after treatment (mean+/-s.d., P<0. 01). In cardiomyopathic patients, on the other hand, there was no significant difference of left ventricular mass after treatment (before v after, 305+/-85 v 285+/-90 g, mean+/-s.d.). These results suggest that the mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy differs between patients with hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "458": "Redox stress during post-ischemic reperfusion may be the prime signal for processes leading to myocardial remodelling and hypertrophy. Nitric oxide (NO) is antioxidative, antiadhesive for neutrophils (PMN) and antiproliferative. Thus, enhancing endothelial production of NO, e.g. by inhibiting breakdown of endogenous bradykinin via angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), could be beneficial. The effect of cilazaprilat (CILA, 10 micro M), an ACE inhibitor, on redox status, expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin, and PMN adhesion under conditions of oxidative stress was investigated in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Incubation of the cells with H2O2 (0.1 and 1 mm) for 15 min served as oxidative stimulus. The intra- and extracellular concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) were measured by HPLC as indicators of endothelial redox status. Expression of P-selectin was measured by flow cytometry. Furthermore, firm leukocyte adhesion to HUVECs was assessed. In controls, the intracellular ratio GSH/GSSG averaged 47 and dropped to 30 after incubation with 0.1 mm H2O2. The ratio declined to 6.5 with 1 mm H2O2. CILA blocked the effects of 0.1 mm H2O2, but was ineffective against 1 mm peroxide. The extracellular ratio did not discriminate between 0.1 and 1 mm H2O2, falling from 18 to 1 in both situations. P-selectin expression rose from 100% (control) to 146% after 1 mm H2O2 without CILA, but only to 114% in the presence of CILA. PMN adhesion was enhanced from about 1600 PMN per microwell (control) to 4300/well by 1 mm H2O2. CILA had no significant effect on adhesion (3900 PMN/well). Exposure of HUVECs to 0.1 mm H2O2 affected neither P-selectin expression nor PMN adhesion. Consequently, ACE inhibition can mitigate mild (0.1 mm H2O2) but not more severe redox stress in HUVECs. Irrespectively, CILA reduced the upregulation of P-selectin at the higher H2O2 concentration, indicating that this process is regulated independently of the cellular redox status. The firm adhesion of PMN to HUVECs was independent of P-selectin expression.", 
    "459": "We tested whether ACE-inhibition with ramipril (A), beta-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol (beta) or combined treatment (beta A) for 6 weeks after inducing myocardial infarction in rats by left coronary artery ligation modifies contractile function of hypertrophied papillary muscle from left ventricles with different infarct size (IS) compared to a placebo group (P). At IS<40% of left ventricle, contraction and relaxation were less impaired than at IS>40% compared to sham operated rats (SO). Isometrically developed peak force and calcium sensitivity of myofilaments, measured in skinned fibres, were significantly higher in beta. Treatment with ramipril or metoprolol improved contraction rate and force development, respectively, mainly at IS<40%, but deteriorated relaxation rate. ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenergic blockade had no significant improving effect on the relaxation rate and further characteristics of the contractile function at IS>40%, although combined treatment reduced the infarct size and ramipril treatment suppressed the development of hypertrophy. Post-extrastimulatory potentiation was increased in beta and beta A at IS>40%. Post-rest potentiations were influenced hardly at IS<40% and were significantly smaller in A at IS>40%. The twitch-to-twitch decay of the potentiations was faster at IS>40%. Increase in the degree of post-extrastimulatory potentiation, steeper twitch-dependent decay of the potentiations and loss of rest-dependent potentiation at IS>40% indicate relatively increased trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ transports via Ca2+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange, partly modified by ramipril and metoprolol. The results demonstrate that ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenergic blockade induce a dissociation between trophic effects and phenotypic effects on contractile function after chronic infarction.",

It was inhibited by the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist icatibant (HOE-140) and by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine. Bradykinin-induced relaxation was significantly potentiated by the kininase I carboxypeptidase inhibitor mergepta (10(-6) M). Bradykinin (>10(-7) M) elicited contraction of preparations with or without endothelium. The contraction was abolished by indomethacin but was not affected by the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2-receptor antagonist SQ 29,548. Icatibant and the bradykinin B1-receptor antagonist desArg9[Leu8]bradykinin significantly decreased bradykinin-induced contraction regardless of endothelial function. The contraction also was decreased by treatment with mergepta. The bradykinin B1-receptor agonist desArg9-bradykinin contracted endothelium-denuded arterial strips. This contraction was significantly decreased by desArg9[Leu8]bradykinin but not by icatibant. The desArg9-bradykinin-induced contraction also was inhibited by the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Neither bradykinin-induced relaxation nor contraction was affected by the ACE inhibitors enalaprilat or cilazaprilat. In conclusion, bradykinin-induced relaxation of isolated porcine iliac arteries was mediated by endothelial bradykinin B2 receptors and mainly nitric oxide. Bradykinin-induced contraction was endothelium independent, indomethacin sensitive, and probably mediated by bradykinin B1 (inducible) and B2 receptors located in the vascular smooth-muscle layer. Kininase I carboxypeptidase, and not ACE, is the main enzyme responsible for bradykinin degradation in these vessels.", 
    "474": "To elucidate whether hyperinsulinemia increases blood pressure by increasing sympathetic outflow via the activation of the central angiotensin system, insulin was infused into urethane-anesthetized rats intravenously (i.v.) or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) under euglycemic conditions. Infusion (i.v.) of insulin elicited pressor effects in a dose-dependent manner (13, 20, and 40 mU/min). Although depressor responses to i.v. injections of hexamethonium were significantly greater in insulin-infused than in saline-infused rats, i.v. captopril and d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-arginine vasopressin did not show any differences between the groups. Infusions (i.c.v.) of insulin (8 mU/10 microl) also induced cardiovascular acceleration and augmented the depressor response to i.v. hexamethonium in insulin-infused rats. The i.c.v. pretreatment with the angiotensin II antagonist losartan inhibited the pressor responses to both the i.c.v. and i.v. infusion of insulin. These results suggest that the increase in blood pressure induced by euglycemic hyperinsulinemia is elicited by sympathetic activation and that hyperinsulinemia stimulates the angiotensin system in the brain to increase sympathetic nerve activity.", 
    "475": "S-Nitrosocaptopril (S-NO-Cap), a nitrate and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, may be produced after coadministration of nitroglycerin (NTG) and captopril (CAP). We synthesized S-NO-Cap and investigated its in vivo tolerance. In open-chest dogs, S-NO-Cap [300 microg; intracoronary (i.c.)] and NTG (50 microg, i.c.) increased coronary blood flow (CBF) similarly (8.0 vs. 9.0 ml/min; p = NS; n = 5). After a 2-h i.c. NTG infusion at high dose (1.32 micromol/min), NTG (50 microg, i.c.) had no significant effect on CBF, whereas S-NO-Cap (300 microg, i.c.) still produced an attenuated increase in CBF (4.9 ml/min; p < 0.05 vs. control). On the other hand, after a 2-h i.c. infusion of S-NO-Cap (1.32 micromol/min), the CBF response to S-NO-Cap (300 microg) showed no attenuation, whereas that to NTG (50 microg) was potentiated (8.8 vs. 12.6 ml/min; p < 0.05; n = 6). Under basal conditions, S-NO-Cap (30-300 microg, i.c.) increased CBF dose dependently, whereas CAP (30-300 microg, i.c.) had no effect on CBF, suggesting that S-NO-Cap dilates coronary vessels by a nitrate action but not by an ACE-inhibitory action. In nonsurgical dogs, 2-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion of S-NO-Cap (1.32 micromol/min) had a stable hypotensive effect, whereas that of NTG (1.32 micromol/min) gradually attenuated the effect. Plasma NO3-, an oxidative product of nitric oxide (NO), increased after both infusions, suggesting that S-NO-Cap may act partially as an NO donor, similarly to NTG. Plasma ACE activity was reduced after an S-NO-Cap infusion (5.84 vs. 4.10 IU/L; p < 0.01; n = 5), and plasma aldosterone was markedly increased after NTG infusion relative to that after S-NO-Cap infusion (243.0 vs. 38.6 pg/ml; p < 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine increased after both infusions (393.6 vs. 289.0 pg/ml; p = NS). As judged by the increase in CBF, whereas S-NO-Cap showed partial tolerance with NTG, no tolerance was found with S-NO-Cap itself. The in vivo coronary vascular response to S-NO-Cap may, therefore, be partially reduced by activation of the adrenergic or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems or both induced by NTG, because S-NO-Cap showed no cross-tolerance with NTG in our earlier in vitro study.", 
    "476": "We compared, in a prospective double-blind randomized study, the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril (QUI) with that of triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide (THCT) treatment on cardiovascular end-organ damage in subjects with untreated isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). End-organ damage measurements, performed initially and after 6 and 26 weeks of treatment, included echocardiographic determination of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and of diastolic function and measurement of aortic distensibility and peripheral vascular resistance. Blood pressure was significantly reduced in the 44 subjects (21 QUI, 23 THCT) completing the study. Both LVMI and aortic distensibility had changed at 6 weeks, with comparable improvements in both groups. LV diastolic function showed overall no significant changes, although patterns of early filling did differ between the two drug groups. Peripheral vascular resistance appeared to increase between 6 and 26 weeks in THCT subjects only, along with a decreased aortic distensibility. Blood pressure and LV mass were rapidly and markedly reduced in both treatment groups of ISH subjects, paralleled by an improvement of aortic distensibility. In interpreting these results, the pathophysiologic alterations in ISH need to be taken into account, because these differ strongly from those in diastolic hypertension. Results of LV diastolic function and peripheral vascular resistance were less clear but appear to show less favorable changes in the THCT subjects treatment group.", 
    "477": "Large-scale trials of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) suggest that the benefits are greatest in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. However, early evaluation of LV function in all patients after AMI by current methods can be difficult due to a lack of resources and skilled personnel. Thus a clinical algorithm that could be used at the bedside to reliably identify patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or = 40% would be helpful as an occasional alternative to echocardiography. We have devised such an algorithm based on the presence of one of: (i) clinical signs of heart failure; (ii) an index Q-wave anterior myocardial infarction; (iii) lack of thrombolytic therapy when there is a history of two or more previous myocardial infarctions and a CK rise > 1000 U/l. We tested this new algorithm prospectively in the coronary care units of two hospitals (one UK and one USA). In the UK centre, the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm at identifying patients with a LVEF < or = 40% were 82% and 72%, respectively. In the US centre, the sensitivity of the algorithm was 91% and the specificity 78% at identifying patients with LV dysfunction. We have validated a simple clinical algorithm which can be used at the bedside for identifying patients who would benefit from an ACE inhibitor after AMI.",

All patients received an initial dose of 10 mg, which was titrated up to a maximum of 40 mg if normotensive diastolic blood pressure had not been achieved. Reduction in mean diastolic blood pressure, when compared with baseline data, was significant (p < 0.001) following 16 weeks of treatment. Of the 46 evaluable patients, 32 (70%) had their blood pressure controlled (i.e. diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 Hg). Lisinopril ('Zestril') was well tolerated, with 27% of patients reporting adverse reactions of which cough was the most common. In conclusion, this study shows that Lisinopril ('Zestril\"), when administered to Nigerian patients, is a clinically effective and well-tolerated for mild to Customer to supply Mss.", 
    "479": "57 patients with macrofocal through-and-through myocardial infarction (MI) formed two groups. The control one (37 patients) received conventional treatment and the study one (20 patients) received adjuvant ramipril beginning from day 1 of MI and over the observation period. The patients were examined on day 1, 3, 10 and 20 from the moment of admission. MI patients of all the studied groups exhibited high level of lipid peroxidation (LP) products in the serum. Ramipril treatment produced marked correcting influence on conjugated dienes, malonic dialdehyde and degree of lipid oxidation. In MI patients on ramipril conjugated dienes level was the lowest on MI day 1-3, and malonic dialdehyde on MI day 10-20. Ramipril treatment limited alpha-tocopherol and ceruloplasmin increase in the serum. It is shown that in the mechanism of a positive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in MI not only their direct pharmacological action can be involved but also a correction of LP processes and antioxidant system disturbances.",

However, during ACE-inhibitor treatment, A II plasma levels may also recover through tissue chymase. This study has attempted to verify the feasibility, safety and tolerability of a combined treatment using captopril (75 mg/day) and losartan (25 mg/day), and to ascertain its ability to reduce the formation and action of A II in the early post-infarction phase of reperfused anterior myocardial infarction (AMI).",

Group A (22 subjects: 6 women/16 men) received captopril (75 mg/day) and placebo, while group B (22 subjects: 5 women/17 men) was given captopril (75 mg/day) plus losartan, initially at 12.5 mg and then at 25 mg/day thereafter (BP > 110 mmHg).

At the same time interval, NE and A II values did not show significant differences within or between groups. CONCLUSIONS. For the first time, our data suggest that a combined captopril-losartan treatment is feasible and that it has no particular side effects. In addition, it shows no significant increase of A II that would be produced by losartan alone.", 
    "488": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a type I ectoprotein that is cleaved off the cell surface by a plasma membrane-bound metalloprotease. However, CD4, another type I ectoprotein does not undergo such cleavage-secretion. In this study, we investigated the structural determinants of the ACE protein that regulate the cleavage-secretion process. Substitution and deletion mutations revealed that the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, and the juxtamembrane region encompassing the major and the minor cleavage sites of ACE do not regulate its cleavage. Moreover, a chimeric protein containing the distal extracellular domain of CD4 and the juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and the cytoplasmic domains of ACE, although transported to the cell surface, was not cleavage-secreted. In contrast, the distal extracellular domain of ACE was shown to be the important determinant: a protein containing the distal extracellular domain of ACE and the juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domain of CD4 was efficiently cleaved off the cell surface. The chimeric protein was cleaved within the CD4 sequence and the responsible enzymatic activity was inhibited by Compound 3, a relatively specific inhibitor of the ACE secretase activity. These results demonstrate that, in a chimeric protein, the distal extracellular domain of a cleavable protein, such as ACE, can induce a proteolytic cleavage within the juxtamembrane domain of an uncleaved protein such as CD4.", 
    "489": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is identical with kininase II. Besides reducing the production of angiotensin II, inhibition of ACE potentiates the biological actions of endogenous kinins. In hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy, potentiation of endogenous kinins contributes to the improvement of cardiac function and energy metabolism and to capillary proliferation effected by ACE inhibitors. In myocardial infarction (MI), the potentiation of kinins has been shown to be involved in the reduction of infarct size and improvement of cardiac function by ACE inhibition. The cardioprotective actions of ACE inhibition in MI seem to be, in part, mediated by the augmentation of myocardial blood flow, especially in the ischemic region of the heart.", 
    "490": "An American Cocker Spaniel with low plasma taurine concentration (< 2 nmol/mL) was presented with dyspnoea associated with pulmonary oedema and a left ventricular shortening fraction of 9%. Emergency therapy with furosemide, dobutamine, nitroglycerine and oxygen supplementation led to a good response. Chronic therapy was started with enalapril, furosemide, digoxin and taurine. Improvement in all echocardiographic indices were noted over a 22 week follow-up, most notably an increase in left ventricular shortening fraction to 20%, a decrease of E-point septal separation from 14 mm to 7 mm and marked left ventricular remodelling. This degree of improvement in myocardial function may represent a direct link between dilated cardiomyopathy in the American Cocker Spaniel and plasma taurine deficiency. Alternatively, this response may reflect a breed-related cardiomyopathy with a natural history and therapeutic response not commonly seen in the more common large breed cardiomyopathy presentations.",

    "493": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is briefly characterized, and several of the hypothesized neuroanatomical and neurochemical substrates of this etiologically heterogeneous syndrome are noted. Importantly, alterations in the CNS balance of monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems are probably involved in the pathobiology of OCD. Inasmuch as calcium (Ca) concentration regulates neuronal neurotransmitter release, presynaptic Ca deficiencies can disrupt normal neurotransmission. Supporting this, a case report is presented of a subject with intermittent OCD and comorbid cardiac pathology for whose latter condition a regimen of increasing doses of a Ca channel blocker (CCB) greatly exacerbated the OCD. Upon reducing, then discontinuing the CCB dose, the OCD sympomatology was greatly ameliorated. It is suggested that minimal use of CCBs is indicated for OCD subjects and that, if possible, they be substituted with other drugs. In view of the widespread use of CCBs, this cerebral Ca deficiency hypothesis of OCD etiopathogenesis should be further tested by seeking other OCD subjects, especially from cardiology practices.",

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased. Heart rate and central venous pressure (CVP) did not change. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine volume (V) and sodium excretion (UNaV) decreased in two patients with reduced MAP. GFR, V and UNaV increased in two patients with decreased MAP. No relation between changes in MAP and excretion was observed in six patients. ACE decreased in all patients. Plasma renin activity increased, aldosterone decreased, while atrial natriuretic peptide as well as antidiuretic hormone did not change. Enalaprilat did not facilitate sodium and water excretion during ventilation with PEEP. Decreased MAP indicates that the investigated patients were very dependent on their renin-angiotensin system to maintain systemic perfusion pressure. Base-line MAP and CVP values were no predictors of haemodynamic and excretory changes following acute ACE inhibition.",

    "506": "Excessive deposition of collagen has been implied to be responsible for abnormal stiffness and altered cardiac function during hypertrophy and heart failure. In the present paper we studied the changes in collagen and their phenotypes during development of cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared to age- and sex-matched Wistar Kyoto (WKY). We also studied the changes in collagen after regression of hypertrophy, with antihypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors, captopril (C) and lisinopril (L).",

After 40 weeks, however, in SHR there was an unexpected rise in collagen content and the distribution of collagen phenotype differs compared to WKY, especially during the chronic phase of hypertrophy (65 weeks of age). In WKY during the aging process there was a gradual increase in type III collagen, whereas in SHR it plateaus after 40 weeks of age. Treatment with antihypertensive drugs captopril and lisinopril showed a similar degree of reduction in blood pressure (P < 0.001), regressed hypertrophy (P < 0.001), and reduced collagen, whereas decrease in type I to III ratio was found with captopril only, but not with lisinopril. This decrease in type I to III ratio due to captopril treatment is primarily due to an increase in type III collagen (both protein and transcript level) in SHR.", 
    "509": "Our data showed, for the first time, that during the chronic phase of hypertrophy in SHR there is a gradual reduction in type I to III ratio, primarily due to a lack of increase in type III collagen during chronic phase of hypertrophy. This suggests that quality of collagen is an important factor in determining the degree of cardiac stiffness. Our data also showed that not all ACE inhibitors have similar actions on collagen phenotype production. This suggests that perhaps the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors on collagen are independent of its effect on angiotensin II formation.", 
    "510": "Chronic insulin infusion in rats increases mean arterial pressure (MAP) by a mechanism dependent on angiotensin II (Ang II). However, the fact that plasma renin activity (PRA) decreases with insulin infusion suggests that Ang II sensitivity is increased and that the parallel reduction in Ang II may partly counteract any hypertensive action of insulin. This study tested that hypothesis by clamping Ang II at baseline levels during chronic insulin infusion. Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with artery and vein catheters, and MAP was measured 24 hours per day. In seven angiotensin clamped rats (AC rats), renin-angiotensin II system activity was clamped at normal levels throughout the study by continuous intravenous infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril at 5 mg/kg per day (which decreased MAP by 18+/-2 mm Hg) together with intravenous Ang II at 5 ng/kg per minute. Control MAP in AC rats after clamping averaged 99+/-1 mm Hg, which was not different from the 101+/-2 mm Hg measured before clamping Ang II levels. Control MAP in the 8 vehicle-infused rats averaged 105+/-2 mm Hg. A 7-day infusion of insulin (1.5 mU/kg per minute IV) plus glucose (20 mg/kg per minute IV) increased MAP in both groups of rats; however, the increase in MAP was significantly greater in AC rats (12+/-1 versus 5+/-1 mm Hg). This enhanced hypertensive response to insulin in AC rats was associated with a greater increase in renal vascular resistance (153+/-10% versus 119+/-6% of control) and a significant increase in renal formation of thromboxane (149+/-11% of control). Thus, decreased Ang II during insulin infusion limits the renal vasoconstrictor and hypertensive actions of insulin, and this may be caused, at least in part, by attenuation of renal thromboxane production.", 
    "511": "In the past 30 years, the paradigms to explain the relation between hypertension and progression of renal disease have changed in a dramatic fashion. Thirty years ago it was believed that high blood pressure was necessary to permit the damaged kidney to maintain its function. In contrast, today solid evidence is available that blood pressure is the most important factor accelerating progressive loss of renal function. Furthermore, on the basis of recent observations, target blood pressure during antihypertensive therapy has been substantially lowered. Finally, it could be documented that for interfering with progressive loss of renal function, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are superior to alternative antihypertensive agents (nephroprotection).",

    "516": "APA use (46.3% of patients) was associated with significantly reduced mortality from all causes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73 to 0.92, p = 0.0005) and reduced risk of death or hospital admission for HF (adjusted HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.89, p < 0.0001) but was not influenced by trial assignment, gender, LV ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class or etiology. A strong interaction was observed among APA use, randomization group and all-cause mortality. The association between APA use and survival was not observed in the enalapril group, nor was an enalapril benefit on survival detectable in patients receiving APAs at baseline. However, randomization to enalapril therapy significantly reduced the combined end point of death or hospital admission for HF in APA users.",

    "518": "Serum levels endothelin-1,2 aldosterone, renin activity were performed in 52 patients with chronic congestive heart failure during captopril therapy. The investigations were done before therapy, after 10-15 days therapy and after disappearance symptoms of heart failure. The levels endotelin-1,2,aldosterone and renin activity were determined using radioimmunologic methods. Fraction ejection and peripheral vascular resistance were determined by echocardiography technics. It was found that serum endothelin levels in patients with chronic congestive heart failure were increased proportionally to functional class of heart failure and decreased after disappearance symptoms of heart failure. An increase in plasma endothelin concentration has not correlated with ejection fraction, aldosterone concentration and renin activity. These studies have demonstrated that in patients with congestive heart failure on captopril therapy endothelin serum levels positively correlates with peripheral vascular resistance. No correlation was found between ejection fraction and activity renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These findings indicated that captopril therapy decreases endothelin production.", 
    "519": "Blockade of angiotensin II (Ang II) function during 8 days of oral therapy with lisinopril (20 mg/kg) and losartan (10 mg/kg) normalized the arterial pressure (112+/-3/70+/-3 mm Hg) and raised the plasma concentrations of the vasodilator peptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] of 21 male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Treated animals were then given a 15-minute infusion of either mouse immunoglobulin G1 or a specific monoclonal Ang-(1-7) antibody while their blood pressure and heart rate were recorded continuously in the awake state. The concentrations of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in arterial blood were determined by radioimmunoassay. Infusion of the Ang-(1-7) antibody caused significant elevations in mean arterial pressure that were sustained for the duration of the infusion and were accompanied by transient bradycardia. Although the hemodynamic effects produced by infusion of the Ang-(1-7) antibody had no effect on plasma levels of Ang II, they caused a twofold rise in the plasma concentrations of Ang-(1-7). A pressor response of similar magnitude and characteristics was obtained in a separate group of SHR treated with the combination of lisinopril and losartan for 8 days during an infusion of [Sar1-Thr8]Ang II. The pressor response induced by the administration of this competitive, non-subtype-selective Ang II receptor blocker was not modified by pretreatment of the rats with an angiotensin type-2 (AT2) receptor blocker (PD123319). Plasma concentrations of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) were not changed by the administration of [Sar1-Thr8]Ang II either in the absence or in the presence of PD123319 pretreatment. These results are the first to indicate an important contribution of Ang-(1-7) in mediating the vasodilator effects caused by combined inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and AT1 receptors. The comparable results obtained by administration of [Sar1-Thr8]Ang II suggest that the vasodepressor effects of Ang-(1-7) during the combined treatment is modulated by a non-AT1/AT2 angiotensin subtype receptor.", 
    "520": "Blockade of angiotensin II AT1 receptors combined with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition might amplify the potency of the renin-angiotensin system blockade. We studied whether chronic and simultaneous administration of enalapril and losartan would result in additive or synergistic effects in the (mREN-2)27 transgenic rat (TGR), the investigated targets being blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, renin-angiotensin system blockade achieved, and plasma active renin concentration. In addition, the origin (renal or extrarenal, rat or mouse) of the induced renin release was determined. Adult TGRs were treated orally and daily for 5 to 7 weeks with 1 mg/kg (E1) or 3 mg/kg (E3) enalapril or 1 mg/kg (L1) or 3 mg/kg (L3) losartan, or their combinations (E1L1 and E3L3). At the end of the treatment period, enalapril and losartan exerted dose-dependent and, when combined, additive effects in terms of blood pressure fall and cardiac hypertrophy limitation, and synergistic effects in terms of plasma active renin stimulation and blockade of exogenous angiotensin I pressor effects, with E3L3>E3>L3, E1L1>E1> or =L1, and E1L1=E3>L3). This indicates that in the TGR, (1) the greater the renin-angiotensin system blockade achieved, the greater are the reduction in blood pressure, the limitation of cardiac hypertrophy, and the reactive rise in plasma renin concentration elicited, and (2) the enalapril-losartan combinations are more potent at achieving these goals than any of their constituents individually. In contrast, there was no interaction between the two drugs regarding aldosteronuria reduction. Measurement of plasma renin concentration and renal renin at pH 6.5 and 8.5, ie, the optimal pH values for rat and mouse renin activities, respectively, indicates that in TGRs the counterregulatory process for renin release elicited by enalapril, losartan, or their combination involves primarily rat renin of renal origin, a finding supported further by the observed increase in the rat renal renin hybridization index.", 
    "521": "The benefits of the simultaneous administration of low doses of a calcium antagonist and a converting enzyme inhibitor in the treatment of hypertension and renal vasoconstriction are well established. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the administration of low doses of a calcium antagonist and a converting-enzyme inhibitor have beneficial effects in treating the renal alterations induced by the acute administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor when nitric oxide synthesis is reduced. These effects were examined in anesthetized dogs before and during an acute sodium load. It was found that the intrarenal infusion of meclofenamate (5 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]), simultaneously with a low dose of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (1 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]), produced a 40% decrease of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and a reduction in the renal excretory response to the sodium load. In a second group of dogs, intrarenal verapamil (0.5 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]) was effective in blocking the effects of nitric oxide and prostaglandin synthesis inhibition on sodium excretion and glomerular filtration rate but did not modify the effects on renal blood flow. An intrarenal infusion of trandolapril (0.3 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]) was effective in a third group of dogs in reducing the renal hemodynamic effects but not in preventing the antinatriuretic effect observed in the first group. Finally, in a fourth group, the simultaneous administration of verapamil and trandolapril was effective in treating all the renal changes induced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor when nitric oxide synthesis was reduced. These results suggest that the combination of low doses of trandolapril and verapamil has additive effects in treating the renal vasoconstriction and antinatriuresis induced by the acute administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, when nitric oxide synthesis is reduced.", 
    "522": "The activity and protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) were investigated during the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were studied at three different ages: 4, 14 to 17, and 63 weeks of age. After treatment with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg IV) for 3 hours, the aortas were removed for measurement of NOS activity and protein expression assay by [3H]-L-citrulline formation method and Western blot analysis, respectively. Plasma levels of nitrite/nitrate (NO2-/NO3-) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were also determined. At 14 to 17 weeks and 63 weeks, the basal activity and protein expression of eNOS in the aortas were significantly lower in SHR than in WKY. In addition, the aged WKY exhibited lower eNOS activity than that of adult WKY, but this change was not seen in SHR. By comparison, the basal activity and protein expression of iNOS were only observed in SHR of the 14-to-17-week group and in the 63-week group; SHR still exhibited higher activities, and these differences were further exaggerated by treatment with LPS. The basal and LPS-induced NO2-/NO3- and TNF-alpha levels in the plasma were also higher in the SHR except the 4-week group. After treatment with quinapril, the basal and LPS-induced expressions of iNOS in SHR were significantly attenuated. Our results demonstrated that alterations of activity and protein expression of eNOS and iNOS occurred in SHR. In addition, aging may reduce the activity of eNOS in WKY but not in SHR. The decline of eNOS activity and/or expression may contribute to the development of hypertension, whereas the increase of iNOS expression may be a consequence of the pathological state of vessels associated with hypertension in SHR. However, the augmented expression of iNOS in SHR was attenuated by antihypertensive therapy, suggesting that the abnormal expression of iNOS is associated with hypertension.", 
    "523": "We examined the effect of intravenous enalaprilat on the course of PAI-1 plasma levels in 23 patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolytic therapy. All patients received 100 mg aspirin, 1000 IU/h heparin, thrombolysis with 100 mg rt-PA within 90 min, and betablockers. Eleven out of 23 patients received 5 mg enalaprilat intravenously prior to thrombolysis. Blood samples for determination of PAI-1 plasma levels were collected on admission, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after thrombolysis. PAI-1 plasma levels in patients receiving enalaprilat were similar to those of the control patients before thrombolysis (5 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval: 2-10 vs. 7 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval: 2-10; p = 0.5). The PAI-1AUC was 9 ng/ml/h (95% confidence interval: 5-10) in the enalaprilat group and 19 ng/ml/h (95% confidence interval: 13-26) in the control group (p = 0.0006). The maximum difference was observed 6 h after thrombolysis (enalaprilat: 13 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval: 5-25, control: 42 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval: 18-55; p = 0.003). Our study clearly demonstrates that application of intravenous enalaprilat prior to thrombolysis attenuates the thrombolysis-related increase of PAI-1. This finding may suggest a possible therapeutic approach to influence the fibrinolytic system in patients with acute myocardial infarction after thrombolysis.", 
    "524": "Although angiotensin II bolus administration may be used to increase blood pressure in patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) who have severe hypotension on anesthetic induction, no data are available describing its time course and its effects on the left ventricular function. Fourteen patients chronically treated with ACEI for hypertension and scheduled for vascular surgery were prospectively studied. Patients with cardiac insufficiency were excluded. A transesophageal echocardiography probe was inserted to assess systolic left ventricular function. When hypotension was observed (systolic arterial pressure [SAP] <85 mm Hg), an I.V. bolus of 2.5 microg of angiotensin II (AII) was given, and hemodynamic variables were recorded each 30 s over 5.5 min. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Sixty seconds after the AII bolus injection, the SAP increased from 78 +/- 3 to 152 +/- 6 mm Hg. SAP remained higher than control until the 5th min. This was associated with significant increases in end-diastolic area (from 15.1 +/- 0.6 to 19.3 +/- 1.0 cm2, P < or = 0.001), end-systolic area (from 6.6 +/- 0.4 to 10.7 +/- 0.7 cm2, P < or = 0.001), end-systolic wall stress (from 32 +/- 0.05 to 82 +/- 7 kdynes/cm2, P < or = 0.001). In addition, a decrease in fiber-shortening velocity (from 1.1 +/- 0.05 to 0.76 +/- 0.04 circ/s, P < or = 0.05) and in fractional area change (from 0.57 +/- 0.02 to 0.44 +/- 0.02, P < or = 0.05) was observed. Heart rate did not significantly change during the study. Increases in preload and afterload were observed. However, the administration of AII causes a transient impairment in left ventricular function. We conclude that AII, given as an I.V. bolus of 2.5 microg, is effective in restoring arterial blood pressure within 60 s in patients chronically treated with ACEI.",

    "526": "A potential role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the development and/or maintenance of hypertension in the genetic model of rat hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), has been suggested by studies indicating that treatment of immature animals with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevents subsequent development of hypertension. Because young SHR also demonstrate RAS-dependent increased sodium retention, we examined proximal tubule type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1R) mRNA expression in young (4 wk) or adult (14 wk) SHR compared with age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Proximal tubules were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation, and AT1R mRNA expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At 14 wk, when SHR had established hypertension [mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of SHR vs. WKY: 145 +/- 6 vs. 85 +/- 5 mmHg, n = 14-15], there were no differences in proximal tubule AT1R mRNA levels [SHR vs. WKY: 79 +/- 14 vs. 72 +/- 14 counts/min (cpm) per cpm mutant AT1R per cpm beta-actin x 10(-6), n = 6; not significant (NS)]. In contrast, in 4 wk SHR, at a time of minimal elevations in blood pressure (MAP: 70 +/- 8 vs. 63 +/- 3), SHR proximal tubule AT1R mRNA levels were 263 +/- 30% that of WKY (143 +/- 18 vs. 60 +/- 11 cpm per cpm of mutant AT1R per cpm beta-actin x 10(-6), n = 8; P < 0.005). We have recently shown that chronic ACE inhibition decreases proximal tubule AT1R expression and have also shown that chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalamine (L-DOPA) administration inhibits AT1R expression in adult Sprague-Dawley proximal tubule and cultured proximal tubule, and this inhibition is mediated via Gs-coupled DA1 receptors. When 3-wk-old animals were given L-DOPA or captopril for 1 wk, MAP was not altered (70 +/- 8 vs. 60 +/- 4 or 61 +/- 5 mmHg), but proximal tubule AT1R mRNA was no longer significantly different between SHR and WKY (68 +/- 9 vs. 38 +/- 7 or 20 +/- 3 vs. 47 +/- 15 cpm per cpm of mutant AT1R per cpm beta-actin x 10(-6)), due to a significant decrease in proximal tubule AT1R expression in SHR (P < 0.005, compared with untreated SHR). Immunoreactive proximal tubule AT1R expression also was increased in 4 wk SHR and was reversed with captopril or L-DOPA treatment. Therefore, these results indicate that young, but not adult, SHR have increased expression of proximal tubule AT1R and that chronic L-DOPA or captopril treatment decreased the elevated AT1R expression to control levels. These results provide further support for an important role of the RAS in the development of hypertension in SHR.", 
    "527": "The effects of an ACE-inhibitor (ramipril), a calcium antagonist (felodipine) and placebo on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, blood pressure (BP) and vasoactive hormones were investigated in a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and hypertension, with measurements at entrance and after 12 and 24 months. In total, 33 patients were included: 21 completed the study with 7 patients in each group. GFR was measured as 51Cr-EDTA clearance and the vasoactive hormones with radioimmunoassays. The reduction in GFR was significantly more pronounced in the felodipine group (-7 ml/min) than in the ramipril group (0 ml/min) but the same as in the placebo group (-6 ml/min). The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly more reduced in the ramipril group (-74 mg/mmol) than in the placebo group (-11 mg/mmol), which did not deviate from the felodipine group (-10 mg/mmol). BP was significantly reduced by ramipril and felodipine, but not by placebo. Angiotensin II and aldosterone in plasma increased or tended to increase in the felodipine and placebo groups, but were unchanged in the ramipril group. Endothelin increased only in the placebo group, and vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide were not significantly changed in any of the groups. It is concluded that ramipril seems to be superior to felodipine in chronic glomerulonephritis owing to better preservation of GFR.", 
    "528": "Three hundred and fifty nine cardiology units participated in a study (SEOSI) coordinated by the Association of Italian Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO). The aim of the study was to: (1) evaluate how many patients with suspected or known heart failure consecutively approach a hospital cardiology unit; (2) assess their clinical characteristics; (3) define the diagnostic-therapeutic processes set in motion by cardiologists; (4) evaluate the social and emotional impact of the disease on the patient. In 12 days, 3921 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 67 +/- 12 years (median 69); 49% of the patients were in NYHA class III-IV; atrial fibrillation was present in 27%; 35% of the cases were scheduled for hospital admission. Ischaemic heart disease was the primary cause of heart failure (42%); arterial hypertension accounted for 20%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy for 15% and cardiac valve disease for 15%. A chest X-ray, ECG and echocardiogram were performed in 70-80% of cases; ambulatory ECG in 36% and exercise testing in 11%. ACE inhibitors were administered to 63.5%, calcium antagonists to 19% and beta-blockers to 5.5%. No significant differences in drug prescription were noted in relation to NYHA classification. Multidrug use was common (3.6 +/- 1.6). Main advice was: salt restriction (47%) and rest (44%); physical activity and a formal exercise programme were prescribed to 10% and 5% of patients, respectively. Most patients were addressed to hospital follow-up. Thus, heart failure represents a heavy burden for hospital cardiology units. It can be estimated that about 190,000 patients with heart failure seek care at hospital cardiology units each year and about 65,000 are admitted as inpatients. Cardiologists are reasonably well oriented regarding both examinations required and the prescribing of drugs. Beta-blockers and physical exercise are prescribed very cautiously. The format of the present trial, characterized by brevity, simplicity and low cost, could be used as a tool to gain periodical information on several aspects of national health systems and physician behaviour.",

    "541": "Ischemic renal disease (IRD) is defined as a clinically important reduction in glomerular filtration rate or loss of renal parenchyma caused by hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. IRD is a common and often overlooked clinical entity that presents itself in the setting of extrarenal arteriosclerotic vascular disease in older individuals with azotemia. Eleven to 14% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases are attributable to chronic IRD. A high percentage of patients entering ESRD programs are hypertensive. Many patients with a presumed diagnosis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis actually have undiagnosed ischemic nephropathy as the etiology of their ESRD. It is important for the clinician to identify IRD, because IRD is a potentially reversible cause of chronic renal failure in a hypertensive patient. Atherosclerotic renal artery disease is common among patients with coronary artery disease and aortic and peripheral vascular disease. Atherosclerotic renal artery disease is a progressive disorder, and its progression is associated with loss of renal mass and functioning. A decrease in glomerular filtration rate sufficient to cause an elevation of the serum creatinine concentration requires injury to both kidneys. Consequently, IRD can arise from one of two main clinical situations: bilateral hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis leading to bilateral renal ischemia; and hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney, or in a kidney that is providing the majority of a patient's glomerular filtration. The primary reason for establishing the diagnosis of IRD is the hope that correction of a renal artery stenosis will lead to improvement of renal function, or a delay in progression to ESRD. There are six major clinical settings in which the clinician could suspect IRD: acute renal failure caused by the treatment of hypertension, especially with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; progressive azotemia in a patient with known renovascular hypertension; acute pulmonary edema superimposed upon poorly controlled hypertension and renal failure; progressive azotemia in an elderly patient with refractory or severe hypertension; progressive azotemia in an elderly patient with evidence of atherosclerotic disease; and unexplained progressive azotemia in an elderly patient. Noninvasive testing modalities that have been used recently include the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor renal scan, duplex Doppler sonography, magnetic resonance angiography, and the spiral computed tomography. Treatment methods include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, endovascular stenting, and surgical revascularization. The results of treatment for preservation of renal function have been encouraging, with stabilization or improvement in renal function observed in a significant proportion of cases.",

    "558": "In guinea pig airways, contractions induced by leukotriene D4 or antigen are thought to be mediated primarily by an action of the agonist or of released mast cell-derived mediators directly on the airway smooth muscle cell. An indirect contractile action mediated by endogenous tachykinins also has been described for both of these stimuli. The present study evaluated the contribution of endogenous tachykinins to ovalbumin- and leukotriene D4-induced contractions in the guinea pig bronchus by modulating the concentrations of tachykinins within the tissues and by using neurokinin receptor antagonists. Acute depletion of tachykinins with capsaicin had no effect on responses elicited by either stimulus. Similarly, tetrodotoxin treatment failed to influence leukotriene D4-induced contractions. Inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (thiorphan) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (lisinopril) enhanced neurally mediated tachykininergic responses and potentiated leukotriene D4. The latter effect persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin or the neurokinin antagonists CP99994 and SR48968 and in tissues treated acutely with capsaicin. The potentiation was absent, however, from bronchi incubated with L-cysteine. Ovalbumin-induced contractions were unaltered by inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme. These observations suggest that tachykinins are not involved in mediation of leukotriene D4- or antigen-induced contractions of the guinea pig bronchus. The ability of protease inhibitors to potentiate leukotriene D4 but not antigen-induced responses is therefore ascribed to inhibition of bioinactivation of leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4.", 
    "559": "Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the setting of chronic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on survival and symptoms. However, whether ACE inhibition has direct effects on myocyte contractile processes and if these effects are mediated primarily through the AT1 angiotensin-II receptor subtype remains unclear. The present project examined the relationship between changes in LV and myocyte function and beta adrenergic receptor transduction in four groups of six dogs each: (1) Rapid Pace: LV failure induced by chronic rapid pacing (4 weeks; 216 +/- 2 bpm); (2) Rapid Pace/ACEI: concomitant ACE inhibition (ACEI: fosinopril 30 mg/kg b.i.d.) with chronic pacing; (3) Rapid Pace/AT1 Block: concomitant AT1 Ang-II receptor blockade [Irbesartan: SR 47436(BMS-186295) 30 mg/kg b.i.d.] with chronic pacing; and (4) CONTROL: sham controls. With Rapid Pace, the LV end-diastolic volume increased by 62% and the ejection fraction decreased by 53% from control. With Rapid Pace/ACEI, the LV end-diastolic volume was reduced by 24% and the ejection fraction increased by 26% from Rapid Pace only values. Rapid Pace/AT1 Block did not improve LV geometry or function from Rapid Pace values. Myocyte contractile function decreased by 40% with Rapid Pace and increased from this value by 32% with Rapid Pace/ACEI. Rapid Pace/AT1 Block had no effect on myocyte function when compared with Rapid Pace values. With Rapid Pace/ACEI, beta receptor density and cyclic AMP production were normalized and associated with an improvement in myocyte beta adrenergic response compared with Rapid Pace only. Although Rapid Pace/AT1 also normalized beta receptor density, cyclic AMP production was unchanged and myocyte beta adrenergic response was reduced by 15% compared with Rapid Pace only. ACE inhibition with chronic rapid pacing improved LV and myocyte geometry and function, and normalized beta receptor density and cyclic AMP production. However, AT1 Ang-II receptor blockade with chronic rapid pacing failed to provide similar protective effects on LV and myocyte geometry and function. These unique findings suggest that the effects of ACE inhibition on LV geometry and myocyte contractile processes in the setting of developing LV failure are not primarily caused by modulation of AT1 Ang-II receptor activation.", 
    "560": "1. Angiotensin II is known to enhance sympathetic neurotransmission in the vasculature by increasing the release of noradrenaline, but little is known about the effect on the co-released transmitter, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). In the present study we have examined the effect of angiotensin II on the excitatory junction potential (e.j.p.) elicited by repetitive field stimulation in the guinea-pig isolated mesenteric artery, to establish the angiotensin II receptor subtype involved in modulating the release of ATP and the role of the endothelium in converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. 2. Suramin (300 microM), a P2 purinoceptor antagonist, abolished both the e.j.p.s and depolarizing response to alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, a stable analogue of ATP, without affecting the resting membrane potential and noradrenaline-induced depolarization. 3. Angiotensin II (0.1 microM) affected neither the resting membrane potential nor the amplitude of the first e.j.p., but increased the amplitudes of the subsequent e.j.p.s. This enhancing effect of angiotensin II was abolished by CV-11974 (0.1 microM), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, but unaffected by PD 123319 (1 microM), an angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonist, or CGP 42112A (1 microM), AT2 receptor ligand. 4. Angiotensin I (0.1 microM) exerted a similar effect on e.j.p.s to that of angiotensin II. CV-11974 (0.1 microM) or temocaprilat (10 microM), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, abolished the effect of angiotensin I. Removal of the endothelium did not alter the action of angiotensin I. 5. The results of the present study indicate that the release of ATP from sympathetic nerves innervating the guinea-pig isolated mesenteric artery, as determined from the magnitude of the e.j.p., can be enhanced by angiotensin II via activation of prejunctional AT1 receptors. Qualitatively similar effects were observed with angiotensin I, which appears to be converted into angiotensin II by a subendothelial process.",

In addition, aortic contractility and heart weight were determined. Long-term ACE inhibition, AT1-receptor blockade, and calcium-entry blockade reduced aortic media thickness and increased media smooth-muscle cell density. Only ACE inhibition significantly reduced the extent of intima lesions. Media thickness correlated well with the maximal aortic contraction to phenylephrine and serotonin but not to angiotensin II. ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade decreased heart weight, whereas calcium antagonism increased it. Cyclosporin treatment was without effect on any of these parameters.

The current study was performed to determine the role of calcium release from intracellular stores on the afferent arteriolar response to increases in perfusion pressure. Experiments were performed, in vitro, using the blood perfused, juxtamedullary nephron technique combined with videomicroscopy. The response of afferent arterioles to 30 mm Hg increases in perfusion pressure was determined before and after depletion of intracellular calcium pools with a 10-minute preincubation with 1 micromol/L thapsigargin or 100 micromol/L cyclopiazonic acid. Afferent arteriolar diameter averaged 20.2+/-1.0 microm (n=19) at a control perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg. Increasing perfusion pressure to 130 and 160 mm Hg reduced afferent caliber by 10.7+/-1.0% (P<.05 versus con) and by 24.7+/-1.6% (P<.05 versus diameter at 130 mm Hg); respectively. Thapsigargin significantly increased afferent diameter by 21+/-2% (n=6) at 100 mm Hg and prevented pressure-induced autoregulatory responses. Afferent diameter averaged 24.3+/-1.7, 24.5+/-1.8 and 24.3+/-1.8 microm at perfusion pressures of 100, 130 and 160 mm Hg; respectively. Cyclopiazonic acid treatment also inhibited autoregulatory behavior but did not alter resting vessel diameter. Afferent arteriolar diameter (n=6) averaged 21.4+/-1.9 microm at 100 mm Hg and 20.9+/-2.1 and 20.5+/-2.2 microm at 130 and 160 mm Hg; respectively. Additional studies were performed to assess the role of phospholipase C activity in pressure-mediated autoregulatory behavior of afferent arterioles. Step increases in perfusion pressure decreased afferent diameter by 10.7+/-3.8 and 21.7+/-4.1%; respectively. Administration of the phospholipase C inhibitor, U-73122, (5 micromoles/L) did not significantly alter baseline diameter but did attenuate the pressure-mediated vasoconstrictor response. Increasing perfusion pressure to 130 and 160 mm Hg reduced afferent diameter by only 6.5+/-1.5 and 10.0+/-2.0%; respectively. These data demonstrate that interruption of calcium mobilization with thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, or phospholipase C inhibition markedly attenuates pressure-mediated afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and suggests that autoregulatory adjustments in afferent arteriolar diameter involve calcium release from inositoltrisphosphate(IP3)-sensitive intracellular stores.", 
    "584": "Angiotensin II facilitates epinephrine release during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and this effect appears to be independent of type 1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptors in man. In the present study, we hypothesized that the action of angiotensin II on adrenomedullary epinephrine release is mediated by an AT2 receptor-dependent mechanism. In conscious chronically instrumented rats, we measured plasma concentrations of catecholamines during acute insulin-induced hypoglycemia in groups of rats pretreated with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg i.v.), the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (30 mg/kg i.v.), combined losartan + PD123319, the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (1 mg/kg i.v.), or vehicle. In vehicle-treated rats, the area under the curve for changes in plasma epinephrine concentration [AUC(plasma epinephrine)] during insulin-induced hypoglycemia was 111+/-8 nmolXh/L (+/-SEM). Pretreatment with losartan alone did not affect AUC(plasma epinephrine) (113+/-17 nmol x h/L), while pretreatment with PD123319 tended to reduce the response (87+/-10 nmol x h/L; P=.08 versus vehicle). However, AUC(plasma epinephrine) was significantly reduced in rats that were pretreated with combined losartan + PD123319 (68+/-5 nmol x h/L; P<.001 versus vehicle) or enalapril: 86+/-10 nmol x h/L (P<.05 versus vehicle). Thus, combined treatment with losartan + PD 123319 proved more effective in attenuating the reflex increase in plasma epinephrine concentration during hypoglycemia than either of the two AT receptor antagonists given alone. We speculate that angiotensin II through binding to both receptor subtypes facilitates the sympathoadrenal reflex response by actions at several anatomical levels of the neural pathways involved in the sympathoadrenal reflex response elicited during insulin-induced hypoglycemia.", 
    "585": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors augment circulating levels of the vasodilator peptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in man and animals. Increased concentrations of the peptide may contribute to the antihypertensive effects associated with ACE inhibitors. The rise in Ang-(1-7) following ACE inhibition may result from increased production of the peptide or inhibition of the metabolism of Ang-(1-7)-similar to that observed for bradykinin. To address the latter possibility, we determined whether Ang-(1-7) is a substrate for ACE in vitro. In a pulmonary membrane preparation, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril attenuated the metabolism of low concentrations of 125I-Ang-(1-7). The primary product of 125I-Ang-(1-7) metabolism was identified as Ang-(1-5). Using affinity-purified ACE from canine lung, HPLC separation and amino acid analysis revealed that ACE functioned as a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase cleaving Ang-(1-7) to the pentapeptide Ang-(1-5). The ACE inhibitors lisinopril and enalaprilat (1 micromol/L), as well as the chelating agents EDTA, o-phenanthroline, and DTT (0.1-1 mmol/L) abolished the generation of Ang-(1-5) and did not yield other metabolic products. Ang-(1-5) was not further hydrolyzed by ACE. Kinetic analysis of the hydrolysis of Ang-(1-7) by ACE revealed a substrate affinity of 0.81 micromol/L and maximal velocity of 0.65 micromols min(-1) mg(-1). The calculated turnover constant for the peptide was 1.8 sec(-1) with a catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of 2200 sec(-1) mmol/L(-1). These findings suggest that increased levels of Ang-(1-7) following ACE inhibition may be due, in part, to decreased metabolism of the peptide.", 
    "586": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition alone or in combination with the angiotensin type-I receptor (AT1) antagonist losartan augments circulating levels of the bioactive peptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]. Hence, we determined whether Ang-(1-7) contributes to the hypotensive effects produced by the combined administration of lisinopril and losartan in spontaneously hypertensive rats by blocking the peptide's synthesis with either of two structurally different neprilysin inhibitors. Intravenous administration of CGS 24592 (30 mg/kg) to rats in which blood pressure was normalized by 9 days of therapy with lisinopril and losartan elicited an elevation of mean arterial pressure that was sustained throughout the infusion period and for 20 minutes thereafter. The hypertensive response was associated with a 62% reduction in circulating levels of Ang-(1-7) and no change in plasma angiotensin II (Ang II). Intravenous infusion of one other neprilysin inhibitor (SCH 39370, 30 mg/kg) produced an increase in mean blood pressure of a magnitude similar to that found with CGS 24592. Pretreatment with the nonselective antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]-Ang II abolished any additional pressor effects of either neprilysin inhibitor in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with lisinopril or losartan. However, neither the endothelin A antagonist BQ123 nor the kinin B2 antagonist HOE 140 had an effect on basal blood pressure or altered the pressor or heart rate effects of the neprilysin inhibitors. These data suggest that inhibition of Ang-(1-7) formation in rats exposed to the combined blockade of Ang II production and activity is associated with a reversal of the antihypertensive actions produced by these therapies. Thus, endogenous Ang-(1-7) functions as a vasodilator hormone in this form of genetic hypertension.", 
    "587": "Abnormalities in fibrinolysis, endothelial function, and glucose and lipid metabolism have been reported in hypertension. This study was conducted to examine the interrelationships between fibrinolytic factors, glucose and lipid metabolism, and endothelial function in hypertension. The effects of administering an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril, were also examined. Blood levels of the following substances were measured in patients with borderline and mild hypertension (n=50, 51+/-19 years) and in age-matched controls (n=10): total cholesterol, triglycerides, tissue plasminogen activator activity and antigen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 activity and antigen. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by oral glucose tolerance test, and endothelial function was assessed by evaluating changes in diameter of the brachial artery during reactive hyperemia as observed by ultrasonography. Activities of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 were both elevated in the hypertensive patients. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 antigen correlated with insulin sensitivity, total cholesterol levels, and triglycerides levels (P<.01). Endothelial function was negatively correlated with tissue plasminogen activator activity and antigen (P<.01). The chronic administration of benazepril (5-10 mg/d) for 20 weeks improved insulin sensitivity, endothelial function (6.6+/-3.4-->9.0+/-2.5%, P<.01), and tissue plasminogen activator activity and antigen. These results indicate that abnormalities in fibrinolysis are associated with endothelial dysfunction as well as disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with borderline and mild hypertension. The treatment of such patients with benazepril appeared to improve the impairment in fibrinolysis and endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "588": "Previous studies have suggested that NO may play an important role in protecting the renal vessels from angiotensin II (ANGII)-mediated vasoconstriction. One possible mechanism for this interaction is that ANGII could stimulate NO production in the kidney by increasing endothelial NO synthase (NOS III). The present studies were performed in rats to determine whether acute or chronic elevations in ANGII are associated with enhanced renal NOS III mRNA or protein synthesis. In both acute and chronic studies captopril (20 microg/kg/min) was given I.V. to inhibit endogenous ANGII production. Acute suprarenal infusion of ANGII (8 ng/kg/min) for 110 minutes had no effect on arterial pressure but decreased GFR and renal plasma flow by 20% and 30%, respectively, and increased renal vascular resistance by 70%. Acute ANGII increased renal NOS III mRNA by 70% (as determined by ribonuclease protection assay), but had no effect on renal NOS III protein concentration (as detected by Western blot analyses). In contrast, chronic infusion of ANGII (5 ng/kg/min) for 10 days, increased arterial pressure by 30% and tended to reduce GFR and renal plasma flow. Chronic ANGII had no effect on renal NOS III mRNA levels, but increased NOS III protein by 90%. These data suggest that ANGII can stimulate NOS III synthesis and suggest that this may be one of the mechanisms whereby AngII may enhance NO production.", 
    "589": "To clarify the relationship between blood pressure and insulin resistance, we studied the role of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle and the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on insulin resistance. Blood pressure and plasma glucose and plasma insulin responses to glucose loading (2 g/kg, i.p.) were measured in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs), and Wistar rats at 8, 12, and 20 wk of age. GLUT4 gene expression and plasma membrane protein content were also determined in the gastrocnemius muscle. SHRs and WKYs at the age of 8 wk had significantly higher plasma glucose levels than did age-matched control Wistar rats. Insulin response also tended to be higher. Glucose intolerance was also present in 12-wk-old SHRs, but normalized at the age of 20 wk. In contrast, WKYs were glucose intolerant at 12 and 20 wk. Gene expression and plasma membrane content of GLUT4 were augmented in both 8-wk-old SHRs and WKYs, indicating a compensatory increase in these variables. Effects of captopril (20-30 mg/kg/d from 8 to 20 wk) on GLUT4 were also investigated in these three strains. Captopril improved steady state plasma glucose levels in association with 1.2- to 2.5-fold higher GLUT4 gene expression and a 1.4-fold increase in skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein in SHRs and WKYs. Our results suggest that (1) not only SHRs but also WKYs may have glucose intolerance and hence insulin resistance; (2) gene expression and protein synthesis of skeletal muscle GLUT4 are probably increased compensatorily, indicating that abnormalities in GLUT4 do not have a pivotal role in the development of insulin resistance in SHRs and WKYs; and (3) captopril stimulates skeletal muscle gene expression and synthesis of GLUT4, providing further evidence of its beneficial effect on glucose metabolism.", 
    "590": "Renal and glomerular growth is inherent in early human and experimental diabetes frequently followed by later increase in urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proven effective in delaying progression of human and experimental diabetic renal changes, and so has somatostatin analog treatment in experimental diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate three weeks of octreotide and captopril treatment alone or in combination following three months of untreated experimental diabetes, and compare the effects to those of insulin treatment. Diabetes induced significant increases in renal and glomerular growth and urinary albumin excretion. Octreotide and captopril alone and in combination reduced renal but not glomerular size, and the combined administration reduced UAE. None of these schedules affected blood glucose levels. Insulin treatment inducing euglycemia significantly reduced renal and glomerular size and UAE. In conclusion, insulin treatment with normalization of the diabetic metabolic derangement nearly normalizes renal and glomerular growth and UAE after three months of untreated diabetes. The combined treatment of octreotide and captopril was also followed by a significant decrease in renal growth and reduction in UAE compared to placebo treatment without affecting the metabolic control of the diabetic animals.", 
    "591": "The cost effectiveness of early treatment with lisinopril in acute myocardial infarction (MI) was estimated using survival and cost data gathered prospectively during the hospitalisation of the overall population of patients enrolled in the third study of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto (GISSI-3), which assessed the efficacy of early (within 24 hours) treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) for 6 weeks in a group of 19,394 relatively unselected patients with acute MI. A statistically significant reduction in 6-week mortality was achieved among patients treated with lisinopril when compared with patients allocated to the control group (absolute reduction in mortality: 7.5 +/- 3.6 lives saved per 1000 treated patients). The comparative cost-effectiveness ratio for the use of lisinopril, expressed as cost per additional survivor among patients randomised to receive lisinopril, was $US2080 per life saved (1993 values). The sensitivity analysis conducted to examine the effects of varying the estimated absolute reduction in mortality throughout its 95% confidence interval, which ranged from 14.6 to 0.4 lives saved per 1000 treated patients, showed that the cost-effectiveness ratios consequently vary from $US1121 to $US40,910 per life saved. The cost effectiveness of early treatment with lisinopril of a relatively unselected population of patients with acute MI compares very favourably with that of other therapies judged to be worthwhile by the medical community.",

Incidence of clinically significant increase in serum urea, creatinine and potassium level was evaluated and compared with those of in group treated 47 pts with the same standard therapy captopril, digitalis, furosemide, without spironolacton. There was no significant difference between the incidence of azotemia and hyperkalemia in the two groups.

    "593": "End stage renal disease is an increasingly common problem among both type 2 and type 1 diabetic patients. It is possible to halt or delay the progression from microalbuminuria to proteinuria to end stage renal disease through early screening and aggressive control of blood pressure, blood glucose, and the appropriate use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "594": "Regulation of the mu-opioid receptor gene by opioid analgesic drugs has not been observed in rats and mice following in vivo treatments that produce tolerance. Although in vivo heterologous regulation of mu-opioid receptor mRNA by non-opioid compounds has been reported, the failure to observe changes in mu-opioid receptor mRNA levels in vivo after treatment with opioid agonists raised the possibility that in vivo homologous regulation by agonists may not occur. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of a high intrinsic efficacy opioid receptor agonist on opioid receptor density, gene expression and tolerance was determined. Mice were infused with etorphine for 7 days using an osmotic minipump, then the pump was removed and studies conducted 16-168 h later. Etorphine (50-250 microg/kg/day) infusion produced significant dose-dependent tolerance to the analgesic (tailflick) effects of etorphine, as well as dose-dependent mu-opioid receptor downregulation in brain at 16 h following the end of the infusion. Mu-opioid receptor density returned to control levels over a 168 h period following the end of etorphine (250 microg/kg/day) infusion. Similarly, the magnitude of tolerance decreased over the same period. Evaluation of changes in brain mu-opioid receptor mRNA 16 h following etorphine infusion indicated that there was dose-dependent increase in steady-state levels, with no significant change in GAPDH mRNA. The increase in mu-opioid receptor mRNA was approximately 55-65% over control at the highest etorphine infusion dose. Mu-opioid receptor mRNA returned to control levels over a 168 h period following the end of etorphine (250 microg/kg/day) infusion. These data suggest that the increase in mu-opioid receptor mRNA following the termination of etorphine treatment may drive the recovery of mu-opioid receptors. These data are the first demonstration of in vivo homologous regulation of mu-opioid receptor gene expression in the mouse by an opioid receptor agonist that produces tolerance and receptor downregulation.", 
    "595": "The vascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are mediated by the inhibition of the dual action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE): production of angiotensin II and degradation of bradykinin. The deleterious effect of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) on neonatal renal function have been ascribed to the elevated activity of the renin-angiotensin system. In order to clarify the role of bradykinin in the CEI-induced renal dysfunction of the newborn, the effect of perindoprilat was investigated in anesthetized newborn rabbits with intact or inhibited bradykinin B2 receptors. Inulin and PAH clearances were used as indices of GFR and renal plasma flow, respectively. Perindoprilat (20 microg/kg i.v.) caused marked systemic and renal vasodilation, reflected by a fall in blood pressure and renal vascular resistance. GFR decreased, while urine flow rate did not change. Prior inhibition of the B2 receptors by Hoe 140 (300 microg/kg s.c.) did not prevent any of the hemodynamic changes caused by perindoprilat, indicating that bradykinin accumulation does not contribute to the CEI-induced neonatal renal effects. A control group receiving only Hoe 140 revealed that BK maintains postglomerular vasodilation via B2 receptors in basal conditions. Thus, the absence of functional B2 receptors in the newborn was not responsible for the failure of Hoe 140 to prevent the perindoprilat-induced changes. Species- and/or age-related differences in the kinin-metabolism could explain these results, suggesting that in the newborn rabbit other kininases than ACE are mainly responsible for the degradation of bradykinin.", 
    "596": "We have recently reported that the cardiovascular responses to excitatory amino acids are augmented in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In the present study, we investigated whether the responsiveness to excitatory amino acids would be normalized by antihypertensive treatment. Thus we treated 4-week-old SHR and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with either enalapril (25 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or vehicle for 8 weeks. At 12 weeks of age, systolic blood pressure in the untreated SHR (248+/-9 mm Hg) was significantly (P<.01) higher than that in the enalapril-treated SHR (140+/-4 mm Hg), untreated WKY rats (148+/-4 mm Hg), and enalapril-treated WKY rats (117+/-1 mm Hg). The pressor responses to L-glutamate (2 nmol) microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla were similar in enalapril-treated and untreated SHR (40+/-5 and 47+/-3 mm Hg, respectively, NS), and these responses were significantly greater than that seen in the untreated WKY rats (24+/-2 mm Hg, P<.01). On the other hand, the pressor response to either N-methyl-D-aspartate, an ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist, or (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, in the enalapril-treated SHR was slightly but significantly smaller than that in the untreated SHR but was still markedly greater than those in untreated and enalapril-treated WKY rats. These results suggest that the augmented responsiveness to excitatory amino acids in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of SHR may be at least partly genetically determined and cannot be normalized by the treatment with enalapril.", 
    "597": "To examine chronic changes in mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in cardiac hypertrophy, we determined the activities of two subfamilies of MAP kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), in the heart of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) aged 5, 8, 14, and 24 weeks. MAP kinases were determined by using in-gel kinase assay. In both the left and right ventricles of WKY, the activities of ERKs (p44ERK and p42ERK) and JNKs (p46JNK and p55JNK) decreased significantly with age, indicating that aging remarkably downregulated cardiac MAP kinase activities. In SHRSP, left ventricular ERK and JNK activities were already significantly higher at the mild hypertensive phase than they were in the same age of WKY, and they remained higher until development of left ventricular hypertrophy. On the contrary, the right ventricle of SHRSP, which did not exhibit cardiac hypertrophy, had no significant increase in ERK or JNK activities compared with WKY, except for the slight increase in p55JNK in 24-week-old SHRSP. Antihypertensive treatment of SHRSP with imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, decreased the left ventricular JNK activities (P<.01) but did not affect ERK activities, suggesting the contribution of hypertension or the renin-angiotensin system to the increase in JNKs. Our observations provide the first evidence that both ERK and JNK activities are higher in the left ventricle of SHRSP than WKY. However, further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism and the significance of the increased cardiac MAP kinases in SHRSP.", 
    "598": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block left ventricular hypertrophy in vivo. A component of this effect has been attributed to tissue accumulation of bradykinin. Little is known regarding the effect of bradykinin on cardiomyocytes. The objectives of the present study were to define the effects of bradykinin on isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes (from adult and neonatal rat hearts) and to determine the extent to which bradykinin blocks hypertrophy in vitro. Bradykinin was found to be a hypertrophic agonist, as defined by increased protein synthesis and atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and expression. Bradykinin (10 micromol/L) increased [3H]phenylalanine incorporation by 23+/-3% in adult and by 36+/-10% in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Constitutive atrial natriuretic peptide secretion by neonatal myocytes was increased 357+/-103%. All effects of bradykinin were abolished by the B2-kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140. These increases were similar in magnitude to those observed with phenylephrine (20 micromol/L) and angiotensin II (1 micromol/L). However, in cardiomyocytes cocultured with endothelial cells, bradykinin did not increase protein synthesis. Angiotensin II increased [3H]phenylalanine incorporation by 24+/-3% in adult cardiomyocytes in monoculture and by 22+/-2% in adult rat cardiomyocytes cocultured with endothelial cells. Bradykinin abolished this angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy in myocytes cultured with endothelial cells but not in myocytes studied in the absence of endothelial cells. In conclusion, bradykinin has a direct hypertrophic effect on ventricular myocytes. The presence of endothelial cells is required for the antihypertrophic effects of bradykinin. The results suggest that the increase in local concentration of bradykinin associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is an important mechanism by which hypertrophy can be blocked. Manifestation of this mechanism appears to require bradykinin-stimulated release of paracrine factor(s) from endothelial cells, which are also able to block the hypertrophic effects of Ang II.", 
    "599": "X-linked hereditary nephritis (HN) in Samoyed dogs is a model for human HN (Alport's syndrome). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of renal disease in animal models and human patients. To determine the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment on X-linked HN in Samoyed dogs, a group of affected and a group of normal males were each randomly divided into two subgroups, which were either treated with an ACE inhibitor or left untreated. ACE inhibitor treatment caused significant increases (P < 0.05) in plasma renin activity in normal and affected dogs, confirming its effectiveness, but did not lower systemic blood pressure. Three of four affected treated dogs had improved weight gains and, overall, treated dogs survived 1.36 times longer than affected untreated dogs (P < 0.05). ACE inhibitor treatment of affected dogs significantly delayed (P < 0.05) the onset of an increase in serum creatinine concentration, tended to delay the decline of glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), significantly improved (P < 0.05) the ERPF at 110-154 days of age, and significantly slowed (P < 0.01) the rate of increase of proteinuria. Affected treated dogs showed a significant (P < 0.05) transient reduction in glomerular basement membrane splitting. Thus, ACE inhibitor treatment of Samoyed dogs with X-linked HN produced beneficial effects with respect to renal function, renal structure, and survival.", 
    "600": "Clearly at present, the one perfect surrogate marker for mortality remains elusive. Chronic heart failure is a complex syndrome: as such it may perhaps be too simplistic to expect any single parameter to be universally predictive of drug effects on mortality, especially when each drug works by different mechanisms. Nevertheless, neurohormonal antagonists, such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, seem to benefit both mortality and all surrogate markers of mortality. Equally, inotropic drugs and Class I antiarrhythmics appear to worsen both mortality and many surrogates. This is encouraging. However, significant discrepancies exist, particularly for digoxin, ibopamine and hydralazine-nitrates, although it is only with the latter two that diametrically opposite effects occurred, whereby favourable surrogate effects turned into unfavourable mortality effects (or vice versa). It appears appropriate to have guarded optimism about the potential use of these surrogates to predict drug effects in chronic heart failure. Given our current understanding, none of the parameters discussed above is perfect when used alone. Perhaps a battery of surrogates would be more appropriate rather than there being any single surrogate. The most promising surrogates are heart rate variability, QT dispersion and plasma neurohormones, the first two for sudden death and the last one for death from progressive disease.",

Diastolic hypertension (DBP > or = 96-110 mm Hg) and isolated systolic hypertension (SBP > or = 160-219 mm Hg, DBP 80-94 mm Hg) were analyzed separately. Blood pressure values in both groups were normalized in more than 80% of the patients. In the case of insufficient response an additional dose of 12.5 mg hydrochlorochiazide was somewhat more effective than doubling the dose of the ACE-inhibitor.

A total of 6289 patients being treated for hypertension returned completed questionnaires about their current blood pressure, therapy, side effects, and compliance with physicians' instructions. In addition, 4417 physicians returned completed questionnaires about their prescribing practices, side effects experienced by patients, and patient compliance. The antihypertensive agents they most often prescribed were calcium channel blockers, followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics. The proportion of patients who had well-controlled blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure < 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 95 mm Hg, was similar regardless of the class of antihypertensive agent prescribed. Forty-nine percent of the patients with well-controlled blood pressure reported having at least one side effect while taking their current antihypertensive therapy, whereas a significantly greater percentage of patients (61%) with poorly controlled blood pressure reported side effects. Patients whose blood pressure was poorly controlled tended to have a higher incidence of most side effects than did those with well-controlled blood pressure. Also, the rate of intentional noncompliance was significantly higher in the group with poorly controlled blood pressure. In addition, the rate of noncompliance increased with the number of side effects reported. Although the causal relationship between side effects and non-compliance cannot be determined from this study, further investigation is warranted to better understand the impact these factors may have on overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

Multivariate analysis was used to relate antihypertensive drug class with compliance and variations in compliance with health care costs. The highest estimated rates of compliance were associated with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, and these rates were significantly greater than with beta-blockers and diuretics. Moreover, poor compliance was associated with higher health care costs. Efforts to increase compliance with antihypertensive drug therapy are needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs.", 
    "614": "The US Department of Defense recently assembled electronic records of outpatient prescriptions dispensed through the Uniformed Services Prescription Database Project (USPDP) going back to 1990. The objectives of this portion of a larger study were: (1) to examine longitudinally the patterns of antihypertensive drug use during the first year of therapy in patients whose initial therapy was with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a calcium channel blocker (CCB); (2) to determine continuous and noncontinuous users of antihypertensive drugs; and (3) to estimate the direct medication costs for each pattern of medication use. Filtering criteria for patient and prescription identification were developed, because the USPDP contains no records of confirmatory diagnoses of hypertension. Once data filters were implemented, information for 771 patients was analyzed. An ACE inhibitor was the initial therapy for 328 patients, accounting for 1935 antihypertensive medication prescription fills, and a CCB was the initial therapy for 443 patients, accounting for 2459 fills (including refills). Slightly more than half of the patients (n = 401, 52.0%) were classified as continuous users (> or = 80% medication-possession ratio [supply of medication in days divided by the number of days in the 12-month study period]). In the first year, 177 of these continuous users (44.1%) had no change in therapy in the first year, 49 (12.2%) had an increase in dose, 8 (2.0%) had a decrease in dose, 15 (3.7%) had a change to a different therapeutic class of antihypertensive medication, 14 (3.5%) were changed to a different medication in the same therapeutic class, 20 (5.0%) had a new medication added to the regimen, and 118 (29.4%) had complex regimens involving more than one change. For continuous users, the mean medication supply in days was 354.6, and the average time before a medication change was 152.1 days for those continuous users who had one change in therapy.

For those patients whose therapy was changed to an ACE inhibitor/CCB combination and who were continuous users, the average AWP was $598.47 per year ($492.05 AMP). Once the change from monotherapy to an ACE inhibitor/CCB combination occurred in continuous users, AWP costs per member per month increased by approximately $22.00 ($18.00 AMP).

    "615": "The successful progress of pharmacology in the treatment of several diseases has led to the development of a powerful pharmaceutical industry with an estimated market of over $250 billion. It is therefore understandable that as drug development and marketing has become a major business it has adopted the rules common to other commercial fields. This is a potentially dangerous trend because it undermines what should be the main goal of drug development, i.e. to make active medicinal agents available to the patient with precise and reliable information, at the lowest possible cost, particularly when a national health system has to supply the drugs to patients who have too low an income to pay for them. The huge drug market has also set in motion a competition among pharmaceutical firms. This has meant that as soon as a prototype drug becomes available several other similarly active compounds immediately follow. These followers are usually called \"me-too drugs\". Me-too drugs can be broadly defined as chemically related to the prototype, or other chemical compounds which have an identical mechanism of action. This increasing marketing of me-too drugs has been questioned, so pharmaceutical firms are justifying the development of not-so-innovative drugs. The most common arguments can be summarized as follows: me-too drugs offer an improvement on the efficacy of the prototype; they show a different profile of adverse effects; they are effective in patients resistant to the prototype; they improve compliance in long-term treatment; they are less expensive than the prototype. It is the purpose of this paper to review the evidence substantiating these statements, giving some figures regarding me-too drugs and presenting a few examples.", 
    "616": "Many of the potential effects of antihypertensive therapy, including renal function, have been inadequately investigated in clinical trials in older adults. In an observational study, we examined the association between treatment with various classes of antihypertensive agents and 3-year changes in serum creatinine in 1296 older adults with treated hypertension and without prior renal disease (mean age 72.2 years; 60% female; 30% diabetic; 42% with cardiovascular disease (CVD)) from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Baseline antihypertensive medications included thiazides (HCT), beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), calcium channel blockers (CCB), vasodilators (VAS), HCT + BB, HCT + ACE-I, HCT + CCB, HCT + VAS, loop diuretics (LOOP), and other combinations. Unadjusted results indicated that minimal changes in mean serum creatinine occurred over time for all therapies and only a few changes were statistically significant (HCT: +0.02 mg/dL, ACE-I: +0.04, CCB: +0.04; all P < .05; LOOP: +0.06 mg/dL; P < .001). In multivariate analyses with HCT users as the reference group and adjusting for baseline serum creatinine, age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, CVD, height, weight, common carotid intima-media thickness, and use of allopurinol, phenytoin, cimetidine, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, all of the relative changes were small and statistically nonsignificant except for HCT + VAS users (+0.07 mg/dL; P < .05). When users of the same therapy at baseline and follow-up were restricted, only LOOP users had significant albeit small changes in serum creatinine (+0.05 mg/dL; P < .05). Although results from clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings, these observational data suggest no major differences between specific antihypertensive therapies in 3-year serum creatinine changes in older adults without prior renal disease.", 
    "617": "Angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers have been reported to possess disparate effects on insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to study the effects of the selective beta-1 blocker bisoprolol and of the ACE inhibitor captopril on cellular insulin action in hypertensive individuals. After washout, 12 mild to moderate essential hypertensives were randomized in a double-blind manner to 5 mg bisoprolol daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were measured before and after therapy. Both agents decreased diastolic blood pressure significantly (bisoprolol 96.5+/-0.9 to 87.8+/-3.1 mm Hg; captopril 96.5+/-0.9 to 91.5+/-1.8 mm Hg; P < .05). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin/glucose indices remained unchanged after both therapies, as did lipid profiles. Maximal insulin-stimulated TK activity, assessed by phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate poly-Glu80Tyr20, was significantly higher (P < .05) after bisoprolol treatment, but not after captopril treatment, when compared to placebo (bisoprolol 8.5+/-1.8; captopril 7.3+/-1.5; placebo: 6.4+/-1.3 pmol 32P-ATP/fmol bound insulin). However, captopril, but not bisoprolol, increased the sensitivity of the receptor TK activity, as measured by the half-maximal activity concentration (ED50). Specific insulin binding was not affected by these two agents. Thus, both captopril and bisoprolol may have favorable but different effects on TK activity and insulin action at the cellular level.",

The captopril group was associated with hypotension (P < 0.01) but again PRA, HR and RR were not significantly altered. In the group receiving captopril p.o. and cadmium i.p., BP rose significantly compared with captopril alone but PRA, HR, RR were not altered. Cadmium-induced hypertension cannot be obviously accounted for on its basis of augmented plasma or tissue renin angiotensin involvement.", 
    "619": "To elucidate the local effects of renin in the coronary circulation, we examined local angiotensin (Ang) I and II formation, as well as coronary vasoconstriction in response to renin administration, and compared the effects with exogenous infused Ang I. We perfused isolated hearts from rats overexpressing the human angiotensinogen gene in a Langendorff preparation and measured the hemodynamic effects and the released products. We also investigated cardiac Ang I conversion, including the contribution of non-angiotensin-converting enzyme-dependent Ang II-generating pathways. Finally, we studied Ang I conversion in vitro in heart homogenates. Renin and Ang I infusion both generated Ang II. Ang II release and vasoconstriction continued after renin infusion was stopped, even though renin disappeared immediately from the perfusate. In contrast, after Ang I infusion, Ang II release and coronary flow returned to basal levels. Ang I conversion (Ang II/Ang I ratio) was higher after renin infusion (0.109+/-0.027 versus 0.026+/-0.003, 15 minutes, P<.02) compared with infused Ang I. Remikiren added to the renin infusion abolished Ang I and II; captopril suppressed only Ang II, whereas an AT1 receptor blocker did not affect Ang I and II formation. All the drugs prevented renin-induced coronary flow changes. Total cardiac Ang II-forming activity was only partially inhibited by cilazaprilat (4.1+/-0.1 fmol x min(-1) x mg[-1]) and on a larger extent by chymostatin (2.6+/-0.3 fmol x min(-1) x mg[-1]) compared with control values (5.6+/-0.4 fmol x min(-1) x mg[-1]). We conclude that renin can be taken up by cardiac or coronary vascular tissue and induces long-lasting local Ang II generation and vasoconstriction. Locally formed Ang I was converted more effectively than infused Ang I. Furthermore, the comparison of in vivo and in vitro Ang I conversion suggests that in vitro assays may underestimate the functional contribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme to intracardiac Ang II formation.", 
    "620": "Microalbuminuria has a cumulative incidence of > 30% in persons by 25 y duration of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and is a strong predictor of renal disease and mortality. Although improved glycemic control, maintenance of normal blood pressure, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are important strategies to avoid developing microalbuminuria, dietary macronutrient intake may also play a role. A cross-sectional population-based study of Tasmanian adults with IDDM and no previous diagnosis of microalbuminuria was conducted by measuring usual dietary macronutrient intake with a food-frequency questionnaire and defining microalbuminuria as an average urinary albumin excretion rate between 20 and 200 micrograms albumin/min in at least two of three timed overnight urine collections. After sex, age, duration of diabetes, daily number of insulin injections, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, serum high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, frequency of exercise, and smoking status were adjusted for, the adjusted odds ratio for microalbuminuria for the highest quintile of energy-adjusted usual saturated fat intake compared with the lowest quintile was 4.9 (95% CI: 1.2, 20.0; P = 0.03). The adjusted odds ratio for microalbuminuria for the highest quintile of energy-adjusted usual protein intake compared with the lowest quintile was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.56; P = 0.01). There was no significant association between microalbuminuria and energy-adjusted carbohydrate intake, energy-adjusted monounsaturated fat intake, or energy-adjusted polyunsaturated fat intake.", 
    "621": "The metabolic effects of verapamil alone and in combination with captopril were investigated in rats. Animals received the maximum recommended doses for humans (per kg body weight per day) over a 2-week period. Verapamil had no significant effects on serum biochemistry, but caused a significant increase in serum potassium level and significant reductions in the rates of intestinal absorption of glucose and calcium. Verapamil/captopril had a number of significant effects on serum lipid profile (increased total cholesterol, increased HDL-cholesterol, and reduced LDL-cholesterol), and also provoked an increase in serum alanine amino-transferase activity and in serum glucose levels. The combination treatment caused a significant increase in serum chloride levels, but had no effect on intestinal absorption.", 
    "622": "A total of 501 elderly patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive valsartan or lisinopril in this one year multi-center, double-blind, parallel group trial. Patients received valsartan 40 mg (n = 334) or lisinopril 2.5 mg (n = 167) daily for 2 weeks with subsequent titration (alone or in combination with hydroclorothiazide), depending on response to treatment. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of patients with a response, defined as sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or drop of > or = 10 mmHg from baseline. A high percentage of patients responded to treatment in both valsartan and lisinopril groups: 80% for both groups at 12 weeks and 81% and 87%, respectively, at 52 weeks with no statistically significant difference between treatments (12 weeks, p = 0.925; 52 weeks, p = 0.148). More patients on lisinopril experienced drug-related cough (7.5% on valsartan, 17.4% on lisinopril). In 5.4% of lisinopril treated patients, cough led to discontinuation of therapy compared to 0.6% on valsartan. Valsartan 80 mg daily provides comparable short and long-term antihypertensive efficacy to lisinopril in elderly patients with a lower incidence of drug-related cough.", 
    "623": "Subchronic bolus administration of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor ramipril caused a dose-dependent (0.1 to 10 mg.kg-1.d-1), yet each in his own way 24-hour sustained, reduction in arterial blood pressure in conscious unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats with telemetric recording, and 0.01 mg.kg-1.d-1 was a no-effect dose. This was accompanied by dose-dependent attenuation of heart rate lowering during periods of low locomotor activity. Neither effect persisted for more than a few days after cessation of the medication with full restoration of pretreatment levels. No dosage altered the circadian rhythm of blood pressure, heart rate and locomotor activity of the rats.", 
    "624": "The purpose of the current study was to determine if early, short-term treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with captopril would cause a persistent attenuation of the structural alterations of the heart, aorta, and coronary arteries that are commonly seen in adult SHR. Therefore, mating pairs of SHR were treated with captopril and the pups were kept on captopril (SHRC) or were taken off captopril at two months (SHROC). Untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were mated and served as controls. At 8-10 months of age, heart weight and left ventricular weight/body weight ratios were increased in SHR compared to WKY, SHRC, and SHROC. Aortic medial areas of SHR and SHROC were similar and were larger than WKY and SHRC. Nuclear density in SHR and SHROC was less than WKY and SHRC suggesting hypertrophy of the medial wall. In coronary vessels, medial thickness was greatest in SHR, while there was no difference among WKY, SHRC, SHROC. These data suggest that early, short-term treatment of SHR with captopril permanently attenuated the structural alterations in the heart and coronary vessels that are commonly seen in adult SHR.", 
    "625": "The present experiments were devoted to analyzing the mechanisms involved in the captopril-dependent inhibition of human mesangial cell proliferation. Studies were performed in cultured human mesangial cells incubated with captopril, an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor with antioxidant properties, lisinopril, a non-antioxidant angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor, and tocopherol, a pure antioxidant. Both angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitors significantly inhibited fetal calf serum-induced [3H]thymidine uptake by human mesangial cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, an effect which was not observed with tocopherol. The antiproliferative effect of captopril and its ability to block tyrosine phosphorylation of human mesangial cells proteins were significantly greater than those of lisinopril. Moreover, captopril significantly prevented the fetal calf serum-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp60(c-src). The present results suggest that the antiproliferative ability of captopril does not completely depend on its angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor properties, pointing to a possible interaction of the drug with the intracellular mechanisms responsible for the transmission of the proliferative signals.", 
    "626": "The angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRA) represent a new class of antihypertensive agents, with a mechanism of action that differs from that of other classes of antihypertensive agents that also affect the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The AIIRA were developed to overcome several of the deficiencies of ACE inhibitors, which include the following: 1) competitive inhibition of the ACE enzyme results in a reactive increase in renin and angiotensin I (AI) levels, which may overcome the blockade; 2) ACE is a relatively nonspecific enzyme that has substrates in addition to AI, including bradykinin and other tachykinins; thus, inhibition of ACE may also result in accumulation of these substrates; 3) production of AII can occur through non-ACE pathways, in addition to being produced by the primary ACE pathway; these alternative pathways are unaffected by ACE inhibition; and 4) specific adverse effects are associated with inhibition of the ACE enzyme. This review summarizes the preclinical pharmacology of the AIIRA class of agents and describe the means by which the deficiencies associated with ACE inhibition are overcome. The specific characteristics of the new AIIRA irbesartan are described.", 
    "627": "We evaluated the effect of 2 years' therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) in 16 patients who had severe reflux nephropathy and microalbuminuria. During the period of therapy, microalbuminuria decreased, glomerular filtration rate measured by diethylenetriamine pentaacetate scan, serum creatinine, and blood pressure remained stable. We suggest the captopril was useful in reducing microalbuminuria and may have slowed the progression of renal damage in our patients.",

Outpatients prescribed ACE inhibitors during 1992 and 1993 at a Veterans Affairs medical center general medicine clinic were identified. Case patients had a potassium level higher than 5.1 mmol/L on the day of clinic visit while using an ACE inhibitor; controls had a potassium level lower than 5.0 mmol/L on the day of clinic visit while using an ACE inhibitor and had no elevated potassium level during the study period. Predictor variables measured included type and dosage of ACE inhibitor; serum chemistries; comorbidities; concurrent drug use; and age. Case patients were followed up for 1 year after the index episode of hyperkalemia. Follow-up variables included changes in therapy with ACE inhibitor, maximum potassium for each change, and mortality.",

Results of laboratory studies indicating a serum urea nitrogen level higher than 6.4 mmol/L (18 mg/dL), creatinine level higher than 136 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL), congestive heart failure, and long-acting ACE inhibitors were independently associated with hyperkalemia; concurrent use of loop or thiazide diuretic agent was associated with reduced risk. After 1 year of follow-up, 15 (10%) of 146 case patients remaining on a regimen of an ACE inhibitor developed severe hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mmol/L). A serum urea nitrogen level higher than 8.9 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) and age more than 70 years were independently associated with subsequent severe hyperkalemia.",

However, once hyperkalemia is identified during the use of ACE inhibitors, subsequent severe hyperkalemia is uncommon in patients younger than 70 years with normal renal function.", 
    "632": "We investigated the role of vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, cell proliferation, and the effect of different doses of benazepril on intimal hyperplasia after angioplasty in rabbits. Angioplasty was performed in all left iliac arteries in 28 rabbits. Benazepril was administrated to treatment groups in low (1 mg/kg/day) and high (10 mg/kg/day) doses. Two weeks after angioplasty, vascular ACE activity of the angioplasty subgroup was significantly higher than that of the nonangioplasty subgroup (from 0.44 to 1.19 nmol His-Leu/mg/min; p < 0.01). Strong correlation was demonstrated between vascular ACE activity and intimal area (r = 0.708; p < 0.01). Suppression of vascular ACE activity (59% decrease) and inhibition of intimal hyperplasia (43% decrease) was observed in the high-dose subgroup compared with the angioplasty subgroup without drug intervention (p < 0.01). But in the low-dose subgroup, the level of vascular ACE activity decreased moderately (24.4%; p < 0.05), and the intimal area did not alter significantly. Both the low and high dosage of benazepril resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure (31 and 44 mm Hg, respectively). Striking correlation was displayed between proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cell percentage and intimal area (r = 0.716; p < 0.01). These results indicated that with excessive expression of vascular ACE, intimal cellular proliferation may play a potential role in restenosis after angioplasty. Benazepril could inhibit intimal hyperplasia by suppressing vascular-tissue ACE.", 
    "633": "Our aim was to study the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II (ANG II) on ovarian steroidogenesis and prostaglandin production of amphibian. Hormonal effects of ACE, ACE inhibitors, synthetic bullfrog angiotensin I (ANG I), and [Val5]ANG II were compared on frog ovaries of postreproductive and prereproductive periods. Very high ACE activity was found in ovary of water frog (Rana esculenta) compared with other frog tissues, and this activity was inhibited by the typical ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril. Frog ovary tissue in postreproductive and prereproductive periods was incubated in vitro in the presence of ACE (2.5 mU/ml), captopril (0.1 mM), lisinopril (0.1 mM), [Val5]ANG II (1 microM), and synthetic bullfrog ANG I (1 microM). Production of 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, androgens, and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha was determined. The data showed a modulation of 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, and prostaglandin E2 production by ovary ACE; on the other hand, [Val5]ANG II modulated the production of progesterone and prostaglandin F2 alpha, whereas androgen production was not influenced. The present in vitro studies suggest the existence of two pathways independently regulated by ACE and ANG II modulating ovarian steroidogenesis and prostaglandin production.", 
    "634": "To examine whether the bradykinin-nitric oxide (NO) pathway directly participates in the antihypertrophic property of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in congestive heart failure, the effects of bradykinin were studied in rat cultured heart cells. Bradykinin (0.1, 1 nM) prevented the phenylephrine-induced increase in protein/DNA content, an index of hypertrophy of heart cells, and amplified the nitrite/nitrate content in the medium. Perindoprilat (1 microM), an ACE inhibitor, also restrained the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and augmented NO release. These effects of perindoprilat were abolished by HOE-140 (kinin B2 antagonist), N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NO synthase inhibitor), and methylene blue (guanylate cyclase inhibitor). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between protein/DNA content and nitrite/nitrate content. These results indicate that bradykinin inhibits the progression of cardiac hypertrophy due to the increase in NO release and that perindoprilat produces beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy by stimulating the bradykinin-NO pathway.", 
    "635": "Responses to the synthetic substrate [Pro11,D-Ala12]angiotensin I were investigated in the hindlimb vascular bed of the cat, a system in which local angiotensin-converting enzyme activity is high. Under constant-flow conditions, injections of [Pro11,D-Ala12]angiotensin I into the perfusion circuit in doses of 1-300 micrograms caused dose-related increases in perfusion pressure that were rapid in onset and that were not changed by the presence of a time-delay coil in the perfusion circuit upstream from the site of peptide injection. The synthetic substrate was approximately 100-fold less potent than angiotensin I and II, and responses to [Pro11,D-Ala12]angiotensin I were not altered by captopril in a dose that inhibited pressor responses to angiotensin I but did not alter responses to angiotensin II. Responses to [Pro11,D-Ala12]angiotensin I, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II were inhibited by DUP-532 and candesartan but were not altered by the angiotensin AT2 receptor antagonist PD-123319. The present data show that [Pro11,D-Ala12]angiotensin I has significant vasoconstrictor activity in the hindlimb vascular bed of the cat and suggest that responses are mediated by the activation of AT1 receptors and that activation of AT2 receptors is not involved. The present data show that the onset of responses to [Pro11,D-Ala12]angiotensin I and angiotensin II are similar and are not dependent on the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. The present data suggest that conversion of the synthetic substrate to an active peptide occurs rapidly within the hindlimb vascular bed or that the peptide may have direct AT1 receptor-stimulating activity.",

Blood pressure is also a risk factor for microvascular complications. Antihypertensive therapy, especially with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), can slow progression of nephropathy, but the effects on retinopathy have not been established. We investigated the effect of lisinopril on retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.",

Patients on lisinopril had significantly lower HbA1c at baseline than those on placebo (6.9% vs 7.3 p = 0.05). Retinopathy progressed by at least one level in 21 (13.2%) of 159 patients on lisinopril and 39 (23.4%) of 166 patients on placebo (odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI 0.28-0.89], p = 0.02). This 50% reduction was the same when adjusted for centre and glycaemic control (0.55 [0.30-1.03], p = 0.06). Lisinopril also decreased progression by two or more grades (0.27 [0.07-1.00], p = 0.05), and progression to proliferative retinopathy (0.18 [0.04-0.82], p = 0.03). Progression was not associated with albuminuric status at baseline. Treatment reduced retinopathy incidence (0.69 [0.30-1.59], p = 0.4).",

    "642": "Space maintenance: CF subjects responded to salt depletion with a greater weight loss than did controls (1.9 vs 0.8 kg) and a decrease in 24Na+ space, whereas controls maintained 24Na+ space. Paired (Na-deplete/Na-replete) blood volumes decreased in subjects with CF, but not in controls. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis stimulation: During salt repletion, subjects with CF had significantly higher aldosterone values than did controls in the afternoon, but not at 7:00 AM. During salt depletion, plasma renin activity and aldosterone increased significantly more in subjects with CF than in controls (renin, 35 vs 13 ng/mL/hour [9.7 vs 3.6 ng.L-1 s-1]; aldosterone: 181 vs 101 ng/dL [5021 vs 2802 pmol/L]). Furthermore, the angiotensin antagonist saralasin increased renin much more in subjects with CF (154 vs 36 ng/mL per hour [43 vs 10 ng.L-1 s-1]). Vasomotor functions: Mean arterial pressure was decreased in subjects with CF on both diets and decreased significantly more with low salt only in subjects with CF. During salt depletion, subjects with CF showed enhanced orthostatic tolerance (less heart rate increase with standing) compared with controls, thus obscuring their volume loss. The blood pressure response to an acute infusion of saralasin suggested that in salt-replete subjects with CF, but not in controls, angiotensin receptors were functional in maintaining vascular tone. During salt depletion, angiotensin was more important for maintenance of blood pressure in subjects with CF than in controls, because the saralasin-induced drop in blood pressure was 20%, ie, close to shock levels, in subjects with CF, and only 6% in controls.",

    "644": "We investigated the effects of single and chronic oral administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs. Ozone exposure (3 ppm for 2 h) significantly increased airway responsiveness in vehicle-treated animals and in animals with either single or chronic administration (8 days) of drugs. Single administration of imidapril, enalapril and captopril significantly potentiated ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness at a dose of 100, 50 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, although these doses did not influence airway responsiveness in normal guinea pigs, i.e., the magnitude of potentiation was captopril > enalapril > imidapril. In the study of chronic administration of the drugs, imidapril (10-100 mg/kg per day) had no influence on airway responsiveness in both normal and ozone-treated animals. In contrast, captopril and enalapril (10-100 mg/kg per day) dose-dependently potentiated ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, with no influence on airway responsiveness in normal animals. That is, the magnitude was enalapril > captopril. These results indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors potentiate airway responsiveness in ozone-treated guinea pigs but not in normal guinea pigs and that imidapril is less potent than enalapril and captopril in potentiating ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs.", 
    "645": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an integral part of two enzymatic cascades, one leading to the generation of angiotensin II and the other to the degradation of bradykinin. The great variety of cardiovascular effects mediated by these vasoactive peptides and the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure emphasize the prominent role of ACE in the cardiovascular system. Early in this decade convincing experimental evidence demonstrated the induction of this enzyme in several pathophysiological conditions, including myocardial infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy. In parallel, a deletion/insertion (D/I) polymorphism of the human ACE gene was characterized that is related to 14-50% of the interindividual variance in serum ACE activity. More recently this polymorphism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, diabetic and IgA nephropathy, carotid artery thickening, and lacunar cerebral stroke. However, the associations between the ACE D/I polymorphism and most of these conditions were found to be inconsistent when additional populations were investigated. This contribution reviews the current evidence on the relationship between the ACE D/I polymorphism and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "646": "The incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has increased 9% a year over the past 10 years, due primarily to diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Over this period of time, mortality rates for hypertensive heart disease and stroke have decreased substantially, in large part because of greater recognition and improved therapy of hypertension. Why then is there an increasing incidence of ESRD in diseases in which hypertension plays a significant role in causation and/or progression of renal failure? Is it possible that a lower level of blood pressure than usually recommended is necessary to prevent kidney disease (particularly in blacks) or to prevent or slow progression in most forms of renal failure? Furthermore, are there specific renoprotective drugs? This report will focus primarily on large prospective studies that may provide information to answer these questions.", 
    "647": "Physiological insights gained in the 1980s into mechanisms of disease progression in experimental chronic nephropathies established the basis for therapeutic interventions to retard the progression of chronic renal disease in humans. In the 1990s, several large-scale clinical trials have confirmed the renoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies. Other studies have afforded strong support for the efficacy of dietary protein restriction in certain settings and underscored the importance of blood pressure control in proteinuric individuals. These interventions form the core of current strategies designed to preserve kidney function in patients with chronic renal disease.", 
    "648": "The objective of this study was to determine how effective angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs) must be in preventing diabetic nephropathy to warrant routine administration to insulin-dependent diabetic patients. A Markov model was used to compare three strategies designed to prevent the development of end-stage renal disease in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Strategy I, screening for microalbuminuria and treatment of incipient nephropathy as currently recommended, was compared with strategy II, a protocol in which patients were routinely administered an ACE inhibitor 5 years after diagnosis of diabetes, and strategy III, in which patients at high risk for nephropathy were routinely treated and low-risk patients followed a protocol in which patients were treated with an ACE inhibitor if they developed hypertension and/or macroproteinuria. The model predicted that strategy II would produce as many quality-adjusted life-years as strategy I at nearly the same cost if routine drug therapy reduced the rate of development of microalbuminuria by 26% in all patients. Strategy III produced as many quality-adjusted life-years at less cost than strategy I if a high-risk cohort could be identified with a rate of developing microalbuminuria at four times the rate of low-risk patients and if drug therapy reduced the rate of developing microalbuminuria in this high-risk group by 20%. In conclusion, routine ACE inhibitor therapy could prove to be cost-effective, especially if high-risk individuals could be identified. A prospective trial examining this goal should be considered.",

These patients were randomized into four groups receiving 48 h of treatment with NTG (0.5 microg/kg body weight per min) or placebo with or without the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg three times daily).", 
    "652": "In patients treated with NTG alone, the maximal reductions in forearm blood flow in response to angiotensin II and phenylephrine were markedly greater (-64 +/- 3% and -53 +/- 4%, respectively) than those in patients receiving placebo (-41 +/- 2% and -42 +/- 2%, respectively). Captopril treatment completely prevented the NTG-induced hypersensitivity to angiotensin II and phenylephrine (-33 +/- 3% and -35 +/- 3%, respectively) but had no significant effect on blood flow responses in patients without NTG treatment (-34 +/- 2% and -37 +/- 3%, respectively).", 
    "653": "We conclude that continuous administration of NTG is associated with an increased sensitivity to phenylephrine and angiotensin II that is prevented by concomitant treatment with captopril. The prevention of NTG-induced hypersensitivity to vasoconstrictors by ACE inhibition indicates an involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating this phenomenon.", 
    "654": "Randomized clinical trails have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality, improve symptoms, and decrease hospitalization rates in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function. Guidelines from the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR) endorse the use of ACE inhibitors in eligible CHF patients and note their underutilization in practice. Randomly selected records of 1,212 Medicare CHF patients in Louisiana, discharged between July 1993 and October 1993, were reviewed. Abstracted data were used to characterize practice patterns and pertinent clinical factors influencing current ACE inhibitor utilization by practicing physicians in eligible Medicare CHF patients admitted to acute care hospitals. A total of 1,133 patients admitted were discharged alive; mean age was 77.6 years (64% female; 68% white). One third of the patients (34%) were already receiving ACE inhibitors on admission; of these, 85% were discharged on ACE inhibitors. The remaining 66% of patients were not on an ACE inhibitor on admission; only 35% of these are documented to have been placed on an ACE inhibitor(s) at discharge. Overall, a significantly large number of CHF patient charts (48%) lacked documentation of LV systolic function assessments. On multivariate logistic regression modeling, the following key clinical variables were positively related to the prescription of ACE inhibitors: low ejection fraction, dyspnea and orthopnea, normal creatinine levels, high diastolic blood pressure, cardiomegaly, and increasing age. Among patients with low ejection fraction, factors contributing to not being discharged on ACE inhibitors included: high creatinine levels, history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, renal failure, and being African American. This study documents the underutilization of ACE inhibitors in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function. Results suggest the need for increased physician-based educational efforts concerning the use of ACE inhibitors in CHF patients, and also for increasing left ventricular systolic function assessments and documentation of findings in patient charts.", 
    "655": "Attenuation of ischaemia-reperfusion induced arrhythmias by several angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as captopril, has been demonstrated. The role of prostaglandin synthesis stimulation in this protective effect of ACE inhibition was evaluated in an in vivo rat model. To produce arrhythmia, the left main coronary artery was occluded for 7 min, followed by 7 min of reperfusion. Captopril (3 mg kg-1) and a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin (2 mg kg-1) alone or together were administered by intravenous (i.v.) injection 10 min before occlusion. Captopril reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and the number of ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) on ischaemia and reperfusion as well as the incidence of reversible ventricular fibrillation (VF) on reperfusion. These protective effects of captopril against ischaemia-reperfusion-induced arrhythmias were prevented by indomethacin. Captopril also caused a sustained decrease of preocclusion values in the arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), whereas in the presence of indomethacin, captopril had no significant effect on either HR or arterial BP values except the heart rate value just before occlusion. Indomethacin alone did not affect either the severity of arrhythmias or the haemodynamic parameters. These results suggest that, in this experimental model, the protective effects of ACE inhibitors on the arrhythmias following ischaemia-reperfusion are mediated by the stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis and the haemodynamic effects of these drugs may have a contributory role in their protective effect.", 
    "656": "The goal of this study was to assess the value of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the early systolic rise on Doppler waveforms obtained before and after administration of captopril in patients suspected of having renal artery stenosis.", 
    "657": "Seventy-one hypertensive patients (135 kidneys) were studied with transrenal Doppler sonography. Ninety-six kidneys were studied again after administration of captopril. All patients also underwent renal angiography. All Doppler studies were independently reviewed by two observers. Specific criteria for Doppler waveform patterns that were applied in the detection of renal artery stenosis included acceleration, acceleration time of early systolic rise, differential velocity of systolic rise, and resistive index. These criteria were then correlated with angiography, and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated.", 
    "658": "On the basis of waveform pattern recognition. Doppler sonograms obtained before administration of captopril had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 98% for the detection of renal artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50%. Sensitivity of Doppler sonography obtained after administration of captopril was 100%, and specificity was 100%. For renal artery stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, sensitivity was 94% and specificity was 89% before administration of captopril. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the acceleration criterion was significantly larger after administration of captopril (p = .009) for the detection of renal artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50%. After captopril administration, an acceleration threshold value of 440 cm/sec2 for early systolic rise was associated with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94% for the detection of renal artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50%.", 
    "659": "Doppler sonography of the renal arteries performed before administration of captopril appears to be an excellent screening tool in the detection of severe stenosis (> or = 70%). Administration of captopril improves the detection of renal artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50% with Doppler sonography when observers use both morphologic and quantitative criteria.", 
    "660": "The basic problem is to compare several treatments with a control in the standard unbalanced one-way layouts. Step-up tests were considered by Dunnett and Tamhane (1995, Biometrics 51, 217-227). In this paper, a method of calculating the critical values of step-up tests is proposed so that the Type I family wise error (FWE) is controlled at a prespecified level alpha. It is also pointed out that the equivalence of a step-up test and the test based on the correspondingly adjusted p-values requires implicitly a monotone property. A practical example is used for illustration.", 
    "661": "Renovascular disease is an important cause of hypertension in children because it is potentially treatable by surgical or angioplasty techniques. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of radio-isotopes (DMSA, DTPA and MAG3) combined with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, in detecting children with renovascular hypertension. We retrospectively reviewed the ultrasound and pre- and post-captopril radionuclide studies (either DMSA and/or DPTA and/or MAG3) of children with sustained hypertension investigated at our institution. Renal angiography was used as the 'reference technique'. Thirty-nine children, over a period of 10 years, were evaluated: 17 (44%) children had renovascular disease that involved the proximal three divisions of the renal arteries, some of which were amenable to treatment. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for detecting such renovascular disease, as assessed by changes between pre- and post-captopril radio-isotope studies, were disappointing at 59%, 68%, 59% and 68%, respectively. When considering only abnormalities in post-captopril studies, these indices were 82%, 41%, 52% and 75%, respectively. Three children with potentially treatable renovascular disease were not identified on the captopril studies. We conclude that renal angiography should remain the 'reference technique' in identifying children suspected of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "662": "The understanding of the atherosclerotic disease process has broadened during the past few years to include the roles of the endothelium and of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) as regulators of a complex interaction of events that may lead to the development of atherosclerosis and, eventually, to the occurrence of clinical ischemia-related events. Several large clinical trials using ACE inhibitors have previously demonstrated a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction and in patients with heart failure or who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction. The effects of ACE inhibition are now being evaluated in other ongoing or recently completed trials in patients with evidence of coronary artery disease, but who have preserved left ventricular function and do not have an acute infarction. The results of these trials can be expected to enhance further our ability to intervene in the atherosclerotic process, resulting in improved outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "663": "Endothelial dysfunction is recognized as the initial step in the atherosclerotic process. To date, most interventions attempting to improve endothelial dysfunction have targeted one or more of the numerous risk factors that can cause endothelial damage: hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists), hypercholesterolemia (lipid-lowering agents), cigarette smoking (cessation), sedentary lifestyle (increased physical activity), menopause (estrogen replacement therapy), and diabetes mellitus (control of associated metabolic abnormalities). Interventions targeted specifically to the endothelium remain speculative, as the precise mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction are still being elucidated. Several pharmacologic agents have been suggested to achieve vascular protection through mechanisms that go beyond their primary therapeutic (e.g., hypotensive or hypocholesterolemic) actions; examples of these are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Beneficial changes to the endothelium might result from promotion of vasorelaxation, inhibition of vasoconstriction, reduction in the production of free radicals, or other mechanisms that protect the endothelium from injury.", 
    "664": "Clinical and pathologic studies have confirmed that disruption or superficial erosion of atherosclerotic plaque is the major cause of coronary thrombosis, which is the primary mechanism responsible for acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Serial angiographic studies have shown that nearly 60-70% of acute coronary syndromes evolve from mildly to moderately obstructive atherosclerotic plaques. The risk of plaque disruption appears to be a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic factors) and extrinsic triggers, and is determined largely by the size of the lipid-rich atheromatous core, the thickness of the fibrous cap covering the core, and the presence of ongoing inflammation within and underneath the cap. Hemodynamic or mechanical stresses may precipitate plaque disruption, particularly in places where the fibrous cap is weakest, such as the shoulders. The degree of thrombosis following plaque disruption depends on the thrombogenicity of the disrupted plaque, the disturbed local rheology, and the systemic thrombotic-thrombolytic milieu. Surges in sympathetic activity (such as those provoked by sudden vigorous exercise, emotional stress, or cold weather) may also trigger plaque disruption. These observations have led to the concept of plaque stabilization as a new strategy for the prevention of acute coronary syndromes. Plaque stabilization can be achieved through pharmacologic and lifestyle-modifying interventions that alter plaque composition and/or inflammatory activity within the plaque and thus reduce its vulnerability to disruption.", 
    "665": "Experimental and clinical studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have suggested that these agents may reduce the risk of atherothrombotic events. Recent studies have identified the role of angiotensin II and ACE in the regulation of fibrinolysis. There is now substantial evidence that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the regulation of vascular fibrinolytic balance. This recently recognized relationship may contribute to the vasculoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "666": "In the last decade, significant advances have occurred in our understanding of the presence and nature of endothelial dysfunction in a number of cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension. Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is recognized as an important mediator of endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, and a defect in the endothelium-derived NO system--possibly decreased synthesis and/or release of NO by endothelial cells--is now known to cause the abnormal response to acetylcholine in hypertensive vessels and to account at least in part for the increased vascular resistance observed in hypertension. Extensive research by our laboratory and others to determine the nature of the defect in the NO system has found that the defect is not related to decreased availability of L-arginine, the NO precursor, or to a defect at the muscarinic receptor level or a specific G protein-dependent intracellular signal-transduction pathway; nor is it related to extracellular inactivation of NO by superoxide anion. These findings have contributed to our understanding of endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension and have pointed out distinctions between the mechanisms leading to this vascular abnormality in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients. While the exact nature of the NO system defect in hypertension is still to be clarified, the vasoconstrictive and proatherogenic effects of endothelial dysfunction probably contribute to the cardiovascular complications associated with elevated blood pressure. Continued research targeted at the identification of the precise mechanism(s) responsible for endothelial dysfunction in hypertension may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce the vascular complications associated with the hypertensive process.", 
    "667": "The ability of the vasculature to modify its geometry in accordance with conditions of its microenvironment--the process of vascular remodeling--is an important pathobiologic process common to vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis, restenosis after angioplasty, and hypertension. Vascular remodeling characterizes the natural history of atherosclerosis, contributes to increased vascular resistance, and may contribute to the clinical complications of hypertension. A growing body of evidence indicates that locally generated vasoactive substances such as angiotensin II and nitric oxide are important determinants of the natural history of vascular disease. In particular, angiotensin II may promote vascular lesion formation by increasing vascular cell population via increased cell growth and decreased programmed cell death, and it may also alter extracellular matrix composition. Thus, angiotensin II is a pleiotropic local mediator capable of modulating cell growth, programmed cell death, migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, and extracellular matrix modulation, all of which are biologic mechanisms of vascular remodeling and intimal formation. This is proposed to occur via a local tissue angiotensin system. Angiotensin II may also promote chronic hypertension by modulating the vascular redox state and promoting the catabolism of the endothelium-derived nitric oxide, an endogenous inhibitory vasodilator. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is strategically positioned to influence the activity of at least three local vasoactive systems--angiotensin II, nitric oxide, and bradykinin--blocking ACE with ACE inhibition may have profound effects on ventricular and vascular structure and function, and have particular efficacy in preventing the morbidity and mortality of vascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.",

    "670": "Development of nitrate tolerance was observed during intravenous nitroglycerin treatment (10 mg/h) in 16 of 19 patients (7 women, 12 men; mean age 56 +/- 8 years) with coronary heart disease [stenosis > or = 75%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II-III). The criterion applied was a loss of efficacy of at least 50% with regard to mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure compared with the maximum effect of nitrate. The effect of captopril (50 mg p.o.) was determined in a blank test. Captopril (50 mg p.o.) was administered again at the stage of clinically manifest nitrate tolerance.", 
    "671": "Compared with the effect of captopril alone, significantly more pronounced reductions in mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (33% compared with 27%) and in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (36% compared with 17%) and significantly greater increases in cardiac index (14% compared with 7%) and stroke work index (34% compared with 18%) (p < 0.05 in each case; Wilcoxon test for linked random samples) were measured. Maintaining nitroglycerin infusion, the effect of captopril (at least 90% of the maximum effect) lasted for 123 +/- 24 min. The baseline values (at least 75% decline in the effect of captopril) were only reached after 369 +/- 34 min.",

    "673": "1. Heterozygous, male, hypertensive, transgenic ((mRen-2)27) rats (350-450 g) were instrumented for the measurement of regional or cardiac haemodynamics (n = 16, in both groups). Animals were given continuous i.v. infusions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, or the dual metallopeptidase inhibitor, MDL 100,240 (both at 3 mg kg-1, 3 mg kg-1 h-1; n = 8 for regional and cardiac haemodynamics), for 32 h. Twenty four hours after the onset of infusion of enalaprilat or MDL 100,240, the bradykinin (B2)-receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (1 mg kg-1, i.v.), was given and measurements were continued for a further 8 h, to assess any possible involvement of bradykinin. 2. Over the first 8 h of infusion, both enalaprilat and MDL 100,240 had significant antihypertensive effects, accompanied by similar regional vasodilatations. However, the blood pressure lowering effect of MDL 100,240 (-54 +/- 9 mmHg) was greater than that of enalaprilat (-38 +/- 4 mmHg), because the former caused a significantly greater reduction in cardiac index. 3. Between 8-24 h after the onset of infusion, there was a reduction in the effect of enalaprilat on blood pressure, because cardiac index rose, with no further increase in total peripheral conductance. In contrast, the antihypertensive effect of MDL 100,240 persisted, in spite of a recovery in cardiac index, because there was further vasodilatation, particularly in the mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. 4. There were no apparent haemodynamic changes associated with the injection of Hoe 140, and over the following 8 h, the difference between the haemodynamic effects of enalaprilat and MDL 100,240 persisted; there was little evidence of suppression of the effects of either drug. 5. These results are more consistent with the antihypertensive effects of enalaprilat or MDL 100,240 in transgenic ((mRen-2)27) rats being due to suppression of angiotensin II production, than due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. The additional effects of MDL 100,240 may be accounted for by inhibition of the degradation of natriuretic peptides reducing cardiac output, initially, and decreasing vascular tone, subsequently. Alternatively, the additional increase in vascular conductance following treatment with MDL 100,240 may represent an autoregulatory response to the reduced pressure.", 
    "674": "1. The effects of combined inhibition of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and angiotensin-converting enzyme, with the dual metallopeptidase inhibitor, MDL 100,240 (3 mg kg-1 bolus, 3 mg kg-1, h-1 infusion), on baseline haemodynamics and on responses to a variety of vasoactive peptides were studied in conscious Long Evans rats (350-450 g: n = 9) chronically instrumented for the assessment of regional haemodynamics. 2. The experiments ran over 4 consecutive days. On the first 2 days the animals received the vehicle for MDL 100,240, and were given bolus i.v. injections of angiotensin I (AI; 250 pmol kg-1), angiotensin II (AII; 125 pmol kg-1), bradykinin (BK: 3 nmol kg-1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1; 250 pmol kg-1) on one day and AI (as above), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP: 500 pmol kg-1) and big endothelin-1 (big ET-1; 500 pmol kg-1) on the other day in a random manner. On the third and fourth experimental days the vasoactive peptides were given in the same order as before, but in the presence of MDL 100,240. 3. Thirty minutes after onset of administration of vehicle, on the first or second experimental day, there were no consistent cardiovascular changes. However, at the same time following onset of MDL 100,240 administration on the third experimental day, there was a significant, but slight, reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; -5 +/- 2 mmHg) together with tachycardia (41 +/- 12 beats min-1) and increases in renal and mesenteric flows (17 +/- 3 and 13 +/- 4%, respectively) and vascular conductances (23 +/- 4 and 19 +/- 5%, respectively). The mesenteric vasodilator effect of MDL 100,240 was still present on the fourth experimental day before administration of the drug on that day, but otherwise the pattern of response to MDL 100,240 was similar to that on the previous day. 4. In the presence of vehicle, AI caused hypertension, bradycardia, and reductions in renal mesenteric and hindquarters vascular conductances; all these effects were abolished by MDL 100,240. 5. In the presence of vehicle, AII caused effects similar to those of AI. MDL 100,240 did not affect the pressor, bradycardic or hindquarters vasoconstrictor effects of AII. However, in the presence of MDL 100,240, the overall renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of AII were enhanced, probably because of the renal and mesenteric vasodilatation caused by MDL 100,240. 6. In the presence of vehicle, BK had a slight pressor effect, accompanied by tachycardia and transient increases in conductances in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. In the presence of MDL 100,240 BK caused marked hypotension, but an attenuated tachycardia; renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilator responses were enhanced. 7. In the presence of vehicle, ANP caused slight hypotension and tachycardia, together with reductions in renal and mesenteric vascular conductances, and transient increases in hindquarters conductance. MDL 100,240 enhanced the hypotensive effect of ANP and promoted a delayed hindquarters vasoconstriction. 8. Big ET-1, in the presence of vehicle, caused a marked and prolonged increase in MAP, accompanied by bradycardia and reductions in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular conductances. Although MDL 100,240 significantly attenuated the magnitude of the pressor effect of big ET-1, its bradycardic and renal, mesenteric and hindquarters haemodynamic actions were not reduced significantly. 9. In the presence of vehicle, ET-1 caused an initial hypotension, tachycardia and vasodilatation in the hindquarters, but reductions in renal and mesenteric vascular conductances; thereafter there was a rise in MAP and bradycardia with vasoconstriction in all three vascular beds. MDL 100,240 had no effect on the initial hypotensive, tachycardic or hindquarters haemodynamic effects of ET-1. Moreover the subsequent pressor and bradycardic actions of ET-1 were unchanged, but its renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects were enhanced, possibly because of the dilatation",

In this study, the activities of dipeptidyl (carboxy)peptidase (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl (amino)peptidase IV (DPP IV) were measured in the blood, the human bronchial epithelial and alveolar cells, bronchoalveolar macrophages, and the soluble phase of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from normal human volunteers and patients with pulmonary pathologic conditions. BAL fluid expressed ACE activity and very low levels of APN and DPP IV activities in the volunteer population, but higher levels could be measured in samples from patients. In patients, increased APN corresponded to a high granulocyte count, while DPP IV and ACE were associated with a high percentage of lymphocytes. Neither AIDS nor smoking induced an increased level of these enzymes. Immunohistochemical staining of bronchoalveolar smears with anti-human ACE monoclonal antibody showed that only macrophages expressed this enzyme. Enzyme histochemistry for DPP IV and APN showed that all leukocytes expressed these activities. APN, DPP IV, and ACE activities were also found in cell extracts of bronchoalveolar macrophages. In extracts of bronchial epithelial and alveolar cells, only APN and DPP IV activities were detected. Kinetic properties of the soluble enzymes in lavage supernatants were comparable to those of serum enzymes. These results demonstrate that soluble forms of cellular enzymes found in BAL fluid are regulated independently of blood and that different cell types may release these enzymes.",

The effect of systemic administration of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on the antihypertensive effects of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, GR138950, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, or hydralazine has been evaluated in unrestrained, conscious renal artery ligated hypertensive (RALH) rats. The effect of the phosphodiesterase type V inhibitor, zaprinast on the antihypertensive effect of GR138950 in RALH rats was also examined. The effect of GR138950 on blood pressure, and plasma and urine cyclic GMP levels was compared to that of zaprinast in conscious RALH rats. 2. GR138950, enalapril or hydralazine caused marked reductions in blood pressure associated with immediate tachycardia in conscious RALH rats. L-NAME pretreatment attenuated the antihypertensive effects of GR138950 or enalapril but not that of hydralazine in conscious RALH rats. The initial tachycardia caused by GR138950 or enalapril but not hydralazine was attenuated by L-NAME pretreatment. L-NAME alone caused a transient (20 min) pressor response and a prolonged (6 h) bradycardia in conscious RALH rats. 3. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not affect the cardiovascular effect of GR138950 in conscious RALH rats. Indomethacin alone did not significantly change basal blood pressure or heart rate in RALH rats. 4. Zaprinast pretreatment did not affect the antihypertensive effect of GR138950 in conscious RALH rats but potentiated the depressor response to sodium nitroprusside. Zaprinast alone caused a small reduction in basal blood pressure but did not change basal heart rate in RALH rats. 5. The antihypertensive effect of GR138950 was not associated with an increase in plasma or urine cyclic GMP levels in conscious RALH rats, whereas zaprinast caused a small fall in blood pressure associated with increases in plasma and urine cyclic GMP. 6. The ability of L-NAME to inhibit the antihypertensive action of GR138950 or enalapril suggests that these agents release nitric oxide (NO) and/or enhance the cardiovascular effects of NO as part of their mechanism of action. However, the inability of zaprinast to potentiate the antihypertensive effects of GR138950 and the finding that GR138950 did not increase urine and plasma cyclic GMP levels are not consistent with this view. Attenuation of the response to GR138950 or enalapril, but not hydralazine, suggests a selective interaction between L-NAME and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, although the nature of this interaction is unknown.",

Of these species, 26 serve as antihypertensive remedies in traditional medicine, and 38 as diuretics-10 of the 64 species have both alleged antihypertensive and diuretic effects. Of the species examined, 26 have not been reported to have any of these effects. Plant material was extracted with both acetone, ethanol and water, and samples were considered active if ACE inhibition was 50% or more in one of the extracts. Of the species with alleged antihypertensive or diuretic effect, 44% proved active. Of the species with no report of such effects, 31% proved active. There were no overall differences in the range of inhibition of the three extracts, but amongst the species considered active there was a strong negative correlation between inhibition of acetone and water extracts. A statistical analysis of the results demonstrated clear differences between plants with alleged antihypertensive effects, diuretic effects, and no alleged use with respect to inhibition of the three extracts.",

    "688": "In congestive heart failure (CHF), some of the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as an increase in exercise oxygen uptake (VO2), are mediated through prostaglandins. Angiotensin (AT1) receptor blockers apparently do not share potentiation of this biosystem. We tested whether losartan improves exercise VO2 in CHF and if the effect is the same as for enalapril. Sixteen men with CHF and 8 volunteers, all nonsmokers and not taking ACE, AT1 receptor, or cyclooxygenase inhibitors, were randomized to receive placebo, enalapril (10 mg 2 times daily), losartan (50 mg/day), each of these 2 drugs plus aspirin (325 mg/day), aspirin, or the same preparations in a reverse order, each for 3 weeks, with a 3-week washout period between treatments. Pulmonary function and VO2 were assessed at the end of each treatment. In CHF, losartan and enalapril caused a similar improvement of VO2 and exercise tolerance, which was absent in controls and was counteracted by aspirin (prostaglandin inhibition) when obtained with enalapril and not with losartan. While on enalapril, we also detected an increase in the diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide, which correlated with changes in VO2 and was antagonized by aspirin, suggesting the possibility that a prostaglandin-mediated functional improvement of the alveolar capillary membrane contributes to the rise in VO2. Thus, losartan is as effective as enalapril for exercise VO2 and exercise tolerance, but the mechanism seems to be dissociated from a prostaglandin biosystem activation. Losartan may represent an advancement in CHF because its efficacy on VO2 is similar to that of enalapril, but is not antagonized by aspirin.",

To produce arrhythmia, the left main coronary artery was occluded for 7 min, followed by 7 min of reperfusion. Captopril (3 mg kg-1) and lisinopril (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg kg-1) caused marked decreases in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, whereas glutathione (5 mg kg-1) had no effect on them. The incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) on ischemia and reperfusion was significantly reduced by captopril and lisinopril. Captopril and 1 mg kg-1 lisinopril also significantly decreased the number of VEB during occlusion and the duration of VT on reperfusion, respectively. These drugs also attenuated the incidence of reversible ventricular fibrillation (VF) and the number of ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) during reperfusion. However, glutathione only reduced the incidence of VT on reperfusion, significantly. These results suggest that, in this experimental model, ACE inhibitors limit the arrhythmias following ischemia-reperfusion and free radical scavenging action of these drugs does not have a major contributory role in their protective effect.",

Therefore, the use of ACE inhibitors can possibly result in antiatherogenic effects. Possible mechanisms for antiatherogenic effects of ACE inhibitors include: (1) reduction of blood pressure; (2) antiproliferative and antimigratory effects on vascular smooth muscle cells, neutrophils, and monocytes; (3) restoration of endothelial function; (4) stabilization of fatty plaque by preventing vasoconstriction; (5) antiplatelet effects; and (6) enhancement of endogenous fibrinolysis.",

    "699": "We report a case of rapidly progressive diabetic nephropathy, from little diabetic change on renal biopsy to severe, nodular, diabetic nephrosclerosis over 32 months. The patient was taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and had a mean arterial pressure of 95 mm Hg over this time period. Her dietary protein intake was low, at least upon presentation. She had three additional mechanisms or potential mechanisms of injury: monoclonal kappa light chains; IgA immune deposits on the first, but not the second biopsy; and longstanding hypertension. Her renal histology was typical for diabetic nephropathy but was not characteristic of kappa light chain disease. We suggest that diabetic nephropathy may develop more rapidly than previously assumed, especially when additional mechanisms of injury, or additional promoters of mesangial matrix accumulation are present.", 
    "700": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) in presence of captopril(C), lisinopril(L) and enalapril(E) were investigated in testis and epididymis of sheep using Hip-His-Leu as substrate. Captopril, lisinopril and enalapril were competitive inhibitors of the enzyme from both tissues. Differences in the I50 and Ki values using these three inhibitors reflects the affinities of these inhibitors for the ACE. In addition, the relative potencies of captopril, lisinopril and enalapril were different for testicular ACE(C > L > E) and epididymal ACE(L > C > E). This observation suggests differences between the active sites of the testicular and epididymal ACE which may reflect on their functions in vivo.", 
    "701": "In this study, we determined the fractional clearance of neutral polydisperse dextrans (theta D) and monodisperse dextran sulfate (theta DS) to describe glomerular size and charge selectivity in 25 renal transplant recipients with proteinuria. Thirteen were treated with low dose lisinopril for six months (group 1) and 12 patients without ACE inhibitor therapy formed group 2. Mean arterial blood pressure was stable (group 1, 112 +/- 4; group 2, 109 +/- 2 mm Hg at baseline and after 6 months) whereas creatinine clearance, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow decreased nonsignificantly but were comparable at any time. Lisinopril treatment lowered filtration fraction (22 +/- 2 vs. 19 +/- 2%, P = 0.07) whereas no change was seen in group 2 (20 +/- 2%). The fractional protein excretion (mg urinary protein per day/ml creatinine clearance per day) was stable in group 1, but significantly increased in group 2. The same pattern was found for theta D larger than 56 A. theta DS was stable and consistently elevated in both groups at any time. We conclude that low dose ACE inhibitor treatment in proteinuric renal transplant recipients stabilizes glomerular size selectivity independently of its systemic hemodynamic effects.", 
    "702": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is a well established disease model leading to fibrosis of the obstructed kidney. In this model, involvement of enhanced renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis has been demonstrated. A 47-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP47) was originally identified as a collagen-binding stress protein, and is currently considered to be a collagen-specific molecular chaperone that plays a pivotal role during the biosynthesis and secretion of procollagen from endoplasmic reticulum. To test if HSP47 is involved in interstitial fibrosis in UUO, we examined the expression of HSP47 mRNA in rat UUO kidneys after 12 hours. 1, 4, 7 days of obstruction. HSP47 mRNA expression was significantly increased as early as 12 hours after obstruction and was sustained at the increased level until seven days. Type I collagen mRNA significantly increased after four days of UUO. Fibrotic changes of interstitium appeared in Masson's trichrome stained section after four days. To explore the possible involvement of angiotensin II (Ang II) in HSP47 induction, the effect of Ang II receptor antagonist (TCV-116) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) was tested. TCV-116 or lisinopril was given to the animals orally once a day at the dose of 10 mg/kg. TCV-116 or lisinopril significantly ameliorated the fibrotic change of interstitium seven days after obstruction. HSP47 and type I collagen mRNA levels in the TCV-116- or lisinopril-treated groups were reduced to about 60% of untreated UUO. A possible involvement of HSP47 in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis in UUO is suggested; however, further investigation is required to identify the signals involved in the induction of HSP47 in UUO.", 
    "703": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the development of hypertensive glomerulosclerosis. However, there are no experimental findings clearly demonstrating activation of glomerular RAS in hypertensive nephropathy. Using the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) as an animal model of hypertensive glomerulosclerosis, we examined the relationship between the sequential changes in urinary albumin excretion (UAE), renal morphology, and glomerular mRNA expression for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and fibronectin (FN) and glomerular mRNA levels for RAS components, and determined the effects of the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT-1) receptor antagonist (candesartan) and equihypotensive hydralazine on these parameters. In SHRSP, UAE was normal at nine weeks of age and increased by 12 weeks. Plasma renin activity, plasma Ang II concentration, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity were not higher in 9- and 12-week-old SHRSP than in WKY. RNase protection assay revealed higher glomerular mRNA levels for angiotensinogen, ACE, and AT-1a and AT-1b receptors in 9-, 12-, and 14-week-old SHRSP than in WKY. The glomerular mRNA levels for TGF-beta and FN in SHRSP were increased from nine weeks of age. SHRSP had a greater glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) at 24 weeks of age than did WKY. Administration of candesartan for two weeks, but not of hydralazine, markedly reduced UAE and normalized mRNA levels for TGF-beta, FN, and RAS components. Candesartan administration for 12 weeks virtually prevented the progression of glomerulosclerosis in rats. We conclude that in SHRSP, RAS activation and increased sensitivity to Ang II in glomeruli play important roles in the progression of glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "704": "We previously reported a new animal model of progressive glomerulonephritis induced by a single intravenous injection of the anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibody MoAb 1-22-3 into uninephrectomized rats (Clin Exp Immunol 102: 181-185, 1995). We examined the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist (candesartan) on the clinical features and morphological lesions of this new model. By 10 weeks after induction of nephritis, untreated rats had developed hypertension, massive proteinuria, renal dysfunction, and severe glomerular injury, while uninephrectomized control rats had not. There was a significant increase in levels of glomerular protein and cortical mRNA for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and type I and type III collagens in untreated nephritic rats. Ten week treatments with candesartan and hydralazine significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) to an equal extent. Candesartan, but not hydralazine, prevented proteinuria, normalized renal function, and ameliorated glomerular injury. Candesartan also reduced levels of glomerular protein and cortical mRNA for TGF-beta and type I and type III collagens, while hydralazine did not. These findings suggest that candesartan prevents progression to end-stage renal failure by modulating the effects of Ang II at least in part on the production of TGF-beta and type I and type III collagens, and not merely on systemic BP.", 
    "705": "Local macrophage proliferation has been shown to be a major mechanism of macrophage accumulation in several immunologically-induced animal models of renal diseases. This study has explored whether local proliferation of macrophages and myofibroblasts contribute to their accumulation in rat remnant kidney model and investigated the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in these cellular pathological events by blocking the angiotensin II activity with ramipril, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or valsartan, an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist. There was local proliferation of macrophages and myofibroblasts within renal parenchyma following renal ablation, contributing significantly to macrophage and myofibroblasts accumulation, renal dysfunction and fibrosis. Both treatment resulted in inhibition of local proliferation of macrophages and myofibroblasts and this was associated with attenuation of renal injury. In conclusion, inhibition of local macrophage and myofibroblast proliferation may be an important mechanism by which Ang II blockade attenuated renal injury following renal ablation.", 
    "706": "In the present study, we investigated the effects of the angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, on blood pressure and renal structural injury in obese Zucker rats (OZR), an experimental model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Twenty-six-week-old OZR with established renal disease were administered either low-dose (15 mg/kg) or high-dose (50 mg/kg) irbesartan in the drinking water for a period of 18 weeks. Irbesartan caused dose-related reductions in blood pressure, and reduced by 47 to 60% the percent of glomeruli with sclerosis at 44 weeks of age (P < 0.05). In addition, irbesartan at the higher dose reduced the tubulointerstitial injury score at 44 weeks by approximately 75% (P < 0.05). By contrast, irbesartan did not significantly reduce albuminuria in OZR. The results of the present study demonstrate that the Ang II receptor antagonist irbesartan can reduce blood pressure and ameliorate glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury in an experimental model of NIDDM.", 
    "707": "The mechanism of decreased albuminuria caused by an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was investigated in patients with early diabetic nephropathy. The subjects were 10 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without azotemia but with albuminuria (less than 650 mg/day). First, a two-week study was done: one week with a diet with ordinary sodium levels and one week with a sodium-restricted diet, in random order. The systemic blood pressure and urinary excretion of sodium and albumin were measured daily. Intrarenal hemodynamics, in terms of the resistance of afferent and efferent arterioles (RA and RE) and glomerular capillary pressure (PGC), were calculated from renal clearance, the plasma total protein concentration, and the pressure-natriuresis relationship. Results obtained before and two weeks after starting the ACE inhibitor cilazapril (2 mg/day) were compared. Urinary excretion of albumin was decreased by cilazapril in 8 of the 10 patients. Cilazapril decreased the RE [6830 (3680, 14,750) to 4660 (1750, 10,790) dynes.sec.cm-5, P < 0.05, mean (minimum, maximum)] and PGC (53 +/- 5 to 43 +/- 9 mm Hg, P < 0.02, mean +/- SD) in these 8 patients, but not in the two other patients. The RA was not significantly changed in any patient. The percent change caused by cilazapril in the urinary excretion of albumin was significantly correlated with the change in PGC (N = 10, r = 0.875, P < 0.01), but not with changes in the systemic blood pressure. In conclusion, the mechanism by which an ACE inhibitor caused a short-term decrease in albuminuria in early diabetic nephropathy involved a glomerular hemodynamic change, namely, a decrease in PGC.", 
    "708": "A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial recently demonstrated that treating patients with chronic renal insufficiency with benazepril significantly decelerates the rate of progression of the disease. We tested the hypothesis that preventative treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril in patients with chronic renal insufficiency is cost-effective. A Markov chain model was used that considered regular treatment, hemodialysis, continuous ambulant peritoneal dialysis, transplantation, rejection and death. Clinical trial data were used to estimate the effects of benazepril treatment and to estimate the duration until renal replacement therapy was needed. Epidemiologic parameters were derived on the basis of Dutch registries of renal diseases, costs are estimated by updating former estimates, literature review and expert opinion. We found that preventative treatment with benazepril decreased the percentage of patients who died or developed end-stage renal disease. Total costs per patient are expected to decrease in three years with more than $4,000 US per patient. Extrapolated to ten years, the savings are estimated at $23,500 US per patient. Benazepril treatment is not only an effective treatment in patients with chronic renal failure. By increasing the years spent without dialysis, it is also a cost-effective treatment.", 
    "709": "The incidence and prevalence rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States continue to increase. In 1995, the incidence rate was 262 per million population, with a point prevalence rate of 975 per million population. The exact number of individuals with abnormal renal function but not yet at end stage is difficult to assess. Crude estimates suggest that approximately 0.4% of the U.S. population has serum creatinine values greater than 2.0 mg/dl. In some sub-populations, such as African Americans, the estimate is + as high as 1.0%. The rate of progression, likewise, is difficult to assess. In general, renal manifestations of certain systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus, and those with significant proteinuria (usually greater that 3.0 g/24 hr) seem to have a more rapid progressive course to end stage. If intervention is expected to be successful in halting or slowing down progression, accurate assessment of the early manifestations of renal disease, structure, and function need to be established. Currently accepted methods of assessment of renal disease include measurement of renal function such as serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate, measurement of proteinuria, assessment of tubular function, glomerular sieving and permselectivity, radiologic imaging techniques, and evaluation of histo-morphometry. Interventions that have been shown to slow progression include control of hypertension, and treatment modalities that reduce proteinuria, such as, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Further clinical and basic science studies are needed to accurately define the important predictors of progression, and interventions that are effective in slowing or halting progression.", 
    "710": "The efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in slowing the advancement of chronic renal disease attests to the importance of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying disease progression. It is apparent from studies of the effects of orally-active AT1 receptor antagonists (AT1RA) in experimental models of chronic progressive renal disease, that AT1RA have broadly similar effects to those of ACEI, implying that the favorable effects of ACEI on systemic and renal hemodynamics and indices of glomerular injury are mediated, in large part, by reducing the action of Ang II at AT1 receptors. The possibility remains, however, that differences in the modes of action of ACEI and AT1RA are significant in terms of renal protection and that the two classes of drugs are not therapeutically equivalent. Thus far, however, virtually all experimental studies comparing the renal protective effects of ACEI versus AT1RA have failed to show any convincing differences between the two classes of drug that cannot be attributed to discrepancies in the levels of blood pressure control achieved. As many rodent studies have adopted protocols originally designed to distinguish between the effects of treatment versus no treatment, however, it may be premature to conclude that ACEI and AT1RA are, essentially, therapeutically equivalent. Since both classes of drug have such potent renoprotective effects, the extent of injury that develops in treated rats may be so slight as to compromise the sensitivity of the experimental comparison. Fresh experimental approaches may be required to overcome this issue and resolve any outstanding questions concerning the therapeutic equivalence of AT1RA and ACEI in slowing the progression of renal disease.", 
    "711": "The renal protective properties of candesartan cilexetil (TCV-116), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1A), and enalapril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), were investigated in 5/6 nephrectomized (NX) rats. Candesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg/day) and enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) were administered orally to 5/6 NX rats for four weeks (during the early phase of disease development) or 16 weeks (through the late phase). In vehicle-treated rats, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration and interstitial fibrosis developed. Moreover, immunohistological studies showed enhanced expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the injured glomeruli. Both drugs inhibited these adverse changes in the early phase. In the late phase, the progressive proteinuria, interstitial MNC infiltration were attenuated by both drugs. However, candesartan cilexetil significantly inhibited the progression of glomerulosclerosis, the expression of TGF-beta 1 and the interstitial fibrosis, while enalapril did not. Candesartan cilexetil and enalapril showed comparable hypotensive effects after the 16-week administration. These results indicate that candesartan cilexetil shows a more potent protective effect than enalapril against the progression of renal injury in the late phase. Thus, an AT1A might be more useful than an ACEI for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure.", 
    "712": "Recent studies have provided evidence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-independent angiotensin (Ang) II formation in tissue renin-angiotensin systems. We studied the effects of Ang II generated by ACE-independent pathways on renal hemodynamics. We used a synthetic peptide, [Pro11, D-Ala12]-Ang I (S), which yields Ang II by chymase, but not by ACE. Infusion of Ang I into a renal artery caused a decrease in renal blood flow, and reciprocally an increase in mean arterial pressure. Infusion of S (1 nmol/kg) caused a decrease in renal blood flow (-20%), but a larger dose was needed to increase mean arterial pressure. Studies with an intravital needle-probe CCD camera revealed that the Ang I infusion induced dose-dependent vasoconstriction of afferent and efferent arterioles (49% and 54%, respectively at 1 nmol/kg). In contrast, infusion of S elicited only 30% constriction of these vessels at a dose of 1 nmol/kg and induced no further constriction at higher doses, indicating that different segments of renal vessels responded in different fashions to Ang II formed via ACE-independent pathways. These vasoconstrictions were abolished by an angiotensin II receptor (AT-1) antagonist. Enzymatic assays using reverse-phase HPLC revealed that the ACE-dependent pathway was predominant in the rena1 cortex (approximately 80%). We also determined Ang II concentrations in renal cortex specimens obtained by needle biopsy. Intrarenal S infusion (10 nmol/kg) increased plasma and renal Ang II concentrations to 160% and 710% of the respective baseline levels. This study provides in vivo evidence of ACE-independent Ang II formation in renal tissue and suggests that this locally-formed Ang II influences the renal circulation in a paracrine fashion.", 
    "713": "Many of the pathophysiologic events associated with kidney disease are driven by angiotensin II. Irrespective of the etiology, many kidney diseases lead to tubulointerstitial inflammation, fibrosis and loss of renal function. Contributors to the process of tubulointerstitial fibrosis include monocyte/macrophage infiltration, the synthesis of profibrotic cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), interstitial myofibroblast proliferation, and clusterin expression. These processes are ameliorated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor (AT-1) impaired fibroblast proliferation, consequent differentiation into myofibroblasts, and the synthesis of TGF-beta 1, but did not prevent monocyte infiltration. TGF-beta 1 synthesis or fibroblast proliferation but prevented the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and blocked clusterin expression. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) family of transcription factors regulates genes involved in inflammation, proliferation and differentiation. ACE inhibition, AT-1 and AT-2 receptor blockade each differentially attenuated NF-kappa B isotype activation. The changes in NF-kappa B isotype may account for the variation seen in the pharmacologic effect of angiotensin II formation or action on the fibrotic process. When considering therapeutic options to prevent renal disease progression, one must be aware of the impact of transcription factors on the injured kidney and the consequent changes in cell infiltration, proliferation and differentiation.", 
    "714": "Recent trials have suggested that control of mild to moderate hypertension can slow progression of many forms of chronic renal disease. These findings may apply to renal transplant hypertension. Renal transplant hypertension, however, does not always behave like other forms of hypertension. Thus, clinical trials have not yet shown that blood pressure control will alter the progression of \"chronic rejection.\" What's more, which of the classes of antihypertensive agents might be most effective is also not certain. Most trials suggest that calcium inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have similar effects on blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive transplant patients.", 
    "715": "While the bulk of the existing data are in diabetic renal disease, there are some animal and clinical studies that compare the effects of angiotensin I (AT-1) receptor antagonists to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in renal disease of nondiabetic origin. Based on these data, preservation of renal function and morphology occurs with AT-1 receptor antagonists in animal models where renal injury is hemodynamically mediated such as in the remnant kidney. Conversely, in non-hemodynamically mediated renal injury such as in puromycin nephrosis, AT-1 receptor antagonists have not consistently protected against declines in glomerular filtration rate or development of interstitial fibrosis. This may, however, be related to dosage, since high doses of AT-1 receptor antagonists show some protection against progression in these models. It is too early, however, to make judgments regarding the clinical impact of the AT-1 receptor antagonists on progression of nondiabetic renal disease. The result of the ELITE trial support the concept that progression of renal dysfunction associated with heart failure is ameliorated to a similar extent between ACE inhibitors and the AT-1 receptor antagonist, losartan. The AT-1 receptor antagonist group also had fewer side effects including the absence of cough as well as a lower, albeit not statistically significant, incidence of hyperkalemia. Thus, the emerging database supports the concept that AT-1 receptor antagonists have an efficacy similar to ACE inhibitors for preserving renal function and morphology in hemodynamically mediated renal injury. It is unclear, however, whether this drug class will reduce immunologically-mediated renal injury.", 
    "716": "The Angiotensin-converting-enzyme Inhibition on Progressive Renal Insufficiency (AIPRI) Study showed that the ACE inhibitor benazepril provides protection against loss of renal function in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) caused by various renal diseases. As a result of unexpectedly low mortality in the placebo group, there was a substantial imbalance in mortality during the course of this study (8 patients on benazepril vs. 1 on placebo). The aim of the extension study was to follow-up the patients from the AIPRI core study until autumn 1996, focusing on CRI progression and mortality. Data collection was post hoc. Patients were treated according to investigators' usual practices, without knowledge of the core study trial medication or (initially) the core trial results. A new primary efficacy parameter was defined as the time from the start of core study treatment to the occurrence of the first event in the combined composite end-point of dialysis, renal transplantation or death related to renal disease. Serial serum creatinine levels and all-cause mortality were also recorded. The median total follow-up for core + extension periods was 6.6 years. Many patients from both treatment groups (64% on benazepril and 61% on placebo) received ACE inhibitors during follow-up. In the intention-to-treat analysis of the core + extension data, only 79 of 300 patients from the benazepril group, compared to 102 of the 283 patients from the placebo group needed dialysis or renal transplantation, or died related to renal disease (P < 0.013, log-rank test). The mortality imbalance seen in the core trial was not evident with the longer follow-up (25 deaths in the benazepril and 23 in the placebo group, before dialysis). These data clearly demonstrate a long-term beneficial effect in patients randomized to take benazepril during the core study, but because treatment during the extension period was not randomized, the results of this intention-to-treat analysis need to be interpreted with care.", 
    "717": "We questioned the superiority of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to beta blocking drugs with regard to renal function outcome in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency and normal to moderately elevated blood pressure (BP). We therefore studied 89 patients in a prospective double-blind randomized trial comparing the effect of enalapril and atenolol on the slope of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Mean baseline GFR was 53 +/- 20 ml/min, untreated BP 152 +/- 20 mm Hg systolic and 90 +/- 11 mm Hg diastolic and median proteinuria 0.6 g/24 hr (interquartile range 0.0 to 2.5). After a run-in period without antihypertensives, the test drug was titrated to lower diastolic BP to a predefined goal of 10 mm Hg below baseline and/or below 95 mm Hg. The median follow up was 3.9 years. Antihypertensive therapy resulted in a comparable decrease of BP in both study groups. Filtration fraction and proteinuria decreased in both groups. The slope of GFR over time was not different between both groups (-1.39 +/- 2.82 and -1.97 +/- 3.38 ml/min/year on atenolol and enalapril, respectively). In multiple regression analysis a higher baseline GFR, a greater decrease in GFR and in proteinuria during titration and a lower proteinuria during follow up were independently related to a better GFR slope. We conclude that the use of ACE inhibitors is not imperative in all patients with non-diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "718": "We correlated baseline parameters with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline and kidney survival in 274 patients with proteinuric non-diabetic chronic nephropathies (creatinine clearance 20 to 70 ml/min/1.73 m2 and proteinuria > 1 g/24 hr over the last three months) enrolled in the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial. The GFR, evaluated at baseline, one, three and six months after randomization then every six months, declined linearly by 0.52 +/- 0.83 ml/min/1.73 m2/month (mean +/- SD) over a follow-up (median: range) of 21:3 to 52 months, and kidney survival was 64%. In multivariate analysis, higher baseline proteinuria (P = 0.006), and lower GFR (P = 0.0001) and creatinine clearance (P = 0.0001) correlated with a faster GFR decline. Higher proteinuria was the only baseline predictor of a shorter kidney survival (P = 0.0007) and its predictive value was independent of the underlying renal disease, treatment randomization, and blood pressure control during the followup. Patients in the lowest tertile of baseline proteinuria (< 2.5 g/24 hr) had the slowest rate of GFR decline (-0.25 +/- 0.72 ml/min/1.73 m2/month) and the highest kidney survival (94%), compared with patients in the middle tertile (proteinuria 2.5 to 4.3 g/24 hr; delta GFR, -0.59 +/- 0.82 ml/min/1.73 m2/month, P = 0.008; kidney survival 57%, P = 0.0011) and in the highest tertile (proteinuria > 4.3 g/24 hr; delta GFR, -0.79 +/- 0.87 ml/min/1.73 m2/month, P = 0.0001, kidney survival 44%, P = 0.0001). Kidney survival significantly differed even between the middle and highest tertiles (P < 0.05). Thus, in non-diabetic chronic nephropathies proteinuria is an independent and accurate predictor of disease progression and ESRF.", 
    "719": "In adult diabetic patients microalbuminuria is a marker of early vascular damage in the micro- and macrocirculation. Microalbuminuria is a powerful predictor of renal and cardiovascular disease outcome and is associated with other, potentially modifiable, risk factors of vascular damage. Studies of secondary prevention have shown that blood pressure lowering drugs effectively reduce albumin excretion rate. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seem particularly effective in reducing the risk of progression to clinical albuminuria in both insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetic patients and this beneficial effect appears to be long-lasting. Whether this postpones the onset of end-stage renal failure and/or reduces early mortality in these patients remains to be established. Recent studies of primary prevention in insulin-dependent diabetic patients predominantly with normoalbuminuria demonstrate that ACE inhibition reduces significantly the rate of progression of albumin excretion rate and, of great interest, seems to affect beneficially the progression of retinopathy. These results compare favorably with the beneficial effect of intensified insulin therapy and strict blood glucose control in this same group of patients. Thus, ACE inhibitors are a powerful tool to prevent progression of microalbuminuria in diabetes and may prove useful as an adjunct therapy to intensified insulin therapy in the prevention of development of microalbuminuria and of retinopathy progression in insulin dependent diabetes.", 
    "720": "Approximately 30% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy. Apart from metabolic control, genetic predisposition plays an important role in its genesis. Analysis of intermediate phenotypic markers showed that the activity of Na/Li- and Na+/H(+)-countertransport is increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The renin-angiotensin system is of crucial importance as a system for therapeutic intervention and as genetic marker for susceptibility to renal disease. Consequently, the analysis of molecular genetic markers has focused on a polymorphism in the gene for the angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE). However, the analysis of the I/D-polymorphism with respect to development of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes has yielded conflicting results, at least in type 1 diabetes. These discrepant results may be due to differences in definition, sample size and ethnic background of the patients. In IgA glomerulonephritis it has been shown that the DD genotype (which is correlated with higher serum and tissue ACE activity compared to II genotype) is associated with a more rapid deterioration of renal function. The same adverse effect of the DD genotype could also be demonstrated in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Two studies examined the response to treatment according to the different genotypes, with contradictory results. A Japanese study showed a more pronounced reduction in proteinuria under ACE inhibitor treatment in patients with DD genotype, whereas a Danish study showed that patients with the DD genotype exhibited a steeper decline in renal function despite ACE inhibitor treatment. The data available for other candidate genes are fragmentary and negative throughout.", 
    "721": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEi) inhibition retards renal function loss, but the therapeutic benefit varies between individuals. Renoprotection is poor in patients with the ACE DD genotype. ACE genotype is reported to affect short-term antiproteinuric response to ACEi, a predictor of long-term renoprotection, in some studies but not in others. Short-term responses to ACEi are enhanced by stimulating the renin-angiotensin system, that is, sodium restriction. We hypothesized that the ACE genotype influences sodium dependency of the response to ACEi. Therefore, we performed a cross sectional analysis of short-term responses to ACEi (enalapril or lisinopril) in 88 patients with stable non-diabetic proteinuria (> 1.0 g/day) and variable sodium intake. ACE genotype distribution was: DD, N = 25; ID, N = 40; II, N = 23. Baseline proteinuria (5.9 +/- 0.7; 5.8 +/- 0.07; 4.8 +/- 0.8 g/day, respectively) and mean arterial pressure (108 +/- 3; 106 +/- 2; 107 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively) were similar for the three genotypes. ACEi similarly reduced proteinuria (-49 +/- 5; -55 +/- 4, -48 +/- 6%, respectively) and blood pressure (-12 +/- 3; -14 +/- 1 and -12 +/- 2%, respectively) in the three groups. Interestingly, the responses to ACEi of proteinuria (r = 0.42, P < 0.05) and blood pressure (r = 0.41, P < 0.05) correlated with urinary sodium excretion in DD genotype but not in the ID (r = 0.05 and 0.17, resp) or II genotype (r = 0.09 and 0.08, respectively). Thus, in the DD group, individuals with a high sodium excretion had a less effective response to ACEi. We conclude that differences in sodium status could account for disparities between studies on the relationship between ACE genotype and response to ACEi, and that sodium restriction might be a strategy to circumvent treatment resistance in the DD genotype.", 
    "722": "Whether any class of antihypertensive drugs has specific renoprotective effects above and beyond lowering of blood pressure is still debatable. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is both localized and has many actions within the kidney, on intrarenal hemodynamics, on the mesangial cell, as well as stimulating growth factors and cytokines. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate the progression of renal failure. How much of this beneficial effect is due to their hemodynamic effects, how much to non-hemodynamic effects and how much to their effects on bradykinin and other putative ACE substrates is still unclear. Experimentally it can be shown that inhibiting ACE but preventing the fall in systemic blood pressure by salt loading abolishes renoprotection. Bradykinin has been implicated in both the beneficial and the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors. Because of this and because ACE inhibitors may not provide complete blockade of the RAS, angiotensin receptor (AT1R) antagonists have been developed. Experimentally AT1R antagonists have been shown to reproduce most of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors. The experience in humans is more limited but they have been demonstrated to be efficacious in hypertension, to reduce proteinuria, and produce a favorable hemodynamic effect in congestive cardiac failure with a low incidence of adverse effects and without cough. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) also have additional properties that may provide renoprotection beyond lowering blood pressure. However, as the different types of CCB block different calcium channels their effects may differ substantially. The inconsistency of the data in the renoprotective effect of CCB may reflect these differences. Quantitatively probably the most important factor in preventing the progress of renal failure by antihypertensive drugs is strict control of blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure by drugs is most likely effective by both reducing physical and sheer stress damage, as well as turning off the signal for the activation and production of vasoactive peptides and cytokines.",

    "730": "The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the metabolism of bradykinin (BK) has been studied in several tissues. However, and contrary to angiotensin I, the metabolism of BK at the cardiac level has not been investigated. In this study, we define the participation of ACE in the carboxy-terminal degradation of BK in heart membranes of the dog, human, rabbit, and rat. The calculation of the kinetic parameters characterizing the metabolism of BK and the generated des-Arg9-BK can be summarized as follows: the half-life (t1/2) of BK [dog (218 +/- 32 s) > human (143 +/- 9 s) = rat (150 +/- 4 s) > rabbit (22 +/- 2 s)] and of des-Arg9-BK [dog (1,042 +/- 40 s) > human (891 +/- 87 s) > rat (621 +/- 65 s) > rabbit (89 +/- 8 s)] both showed significant differences according to species. Enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, significantly prevented the rapid degradation of BK and des-Arg9-BK in all species studied, whereas retrothiorphan, a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, did not affect this metabolism. The relative importance of ACE in the cardiac metabolism of BK was species related: dog (68.4 +/- 3.2%) = human (72.2 +/- 2.0%) > rabbit (47.7 +/- 5.0%) = rat (45.3 +/- 3.9%). ACE participation in the metabolism of des-Arg9-BK was as follows: rabbit (57.0 +/- 4.0%) > dog (39.9 +/- 8.8%) = human (25.4 +/- 5.5%) = rat (36.0 +/- 7.0%). The participation of cardiac kininase I (carboxypeptidase M) in the transformation of BK into des-Arg9-BK was minor: human (2.6 +/- 0.1%) > dog (0.9 +/- 0.1%) = rabbit (1.0 +/- 0.1%) = rat (1.0 +/- 0.1%). These results demonstrate that ACE is the major BK-degrading enzyme in cardiac membranes. However, the metabolism of exogenous BK by heart membranes is species dependent. Our observations could explain some discrepancies regarding the contribution of kinins in the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "731": "The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology have all developed guidelines for improving the care of patients with cardiovascular disease. The guidelines include recommendations for intensive lipid-lowering therapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in those patients with symptomatic heart failure and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Despite clinical trial evidence and consensus that these therapies improve survival in high-risk patients, data suggest that there is wide variation in the delivery of guideline-based care. To investigate whether evidence-based assessment of provider practice patterns can impact the delivery of quality cost-effective care, Merck and Company, in conjunction with leading cardiology group practices, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Medical Review of North Carolina developed an ambulatory medical record abstraction study. This quality assurance initiative was conducted at practices beginning in the spring of 1996 and continues. Medical records and administrative claims of patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure were abstracted by a healthcare consulting organization to maintain patient and physician confidentiality. As of mid-July 1997, 626 group practices had completed the medical record abstraction process, with > 1,136 practices participating at some stage of the project; >6,000 physicians participated in the project and >270,000 patients charts were abstracted. Analysis of these data will provide insight and benchmark patterns of care in the pharmacologic management of heart failure and CAD.

    "732": "The reactive oxygen species has been proposed as a key mediator of the progression of renal injury associated with essential hypertension. Among the defense systems operating against the reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase are the most important antioxidant enzymes (AOEs). In the present study, systolic blood pressure, renal function (creatinine clearance, urinary albumin, and N-acetyl-beta D-glucosaminidase excretion), renal intrinsic AOE activities, and renal histopathology were determined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar Kyoto rats. The effects of a 20-week treatment using three antihypertensive drug regimens--captopril, a sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; temocapril, a potent, non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prodrug; and a conventional triple drug combination that includes a vasodilator (hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide and reserpine)--on renal function, renal tissue, AOE activities, and renal histopathologic abnormalities were evaluated in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Renal function and AOE activities were lower in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats than in the Wistar Kyoto rats. Normalization of systolic blood pressure using the antihypertensive drugs improved renal function and produced a nonuniform alteration in renal AOEs; only glutathione peroxidase activity increased significantly with the use of all three drug regimens. The mild renal histopathologic abnormality in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats was not altered by drug treatment. The improvement in renal function may be related to an increase in glutathione peroxidase activity, but no correlation was seen between renal function changes and alteration in activities of superoxide dismutase or catalase.", 
    "733": "Myocardial remodeling is a central feature in the progression of myocardial failure. This process, which can be stimulated by factors that are increased as a result of myocardial dysfunction such as mechanical stress, angiotensin, and norepinephrine, consists of a variety of molecular and cellular events that can lead to important changes in myocardial structure and function (or phenotype). These alterations include hypertrophy and cellular apoptosis of myocytes, changes in the molecular phenotype of the myocardium with reinduction of a fetal gene program, and alterations in the quantity and composition of the extracellular matrix. Agents that counteract these factors, such as vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-adrenergic antagonists, slow the progression of myocardial failure and are of clinical value in the treatment of heart failure. Several additional mechanisms have recently been identified that could also be important in mediating myocardial remodeling. These include oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, endothelin, and peptide growth factors. It is likely that additional strategies to inhibit these mechanisms will exert beneficial effects on the process of myocardial remodeling and the development of clinical heart failure.", 
    "734": "Short-term goals of heart failure management are directed toward relieving symptoms such as shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, and lower-extremity edema and improving functional capacity and quality of life. Long-term goals include decreasing mortality and slowing or reversing the underlying cardiac structural abnormalities of heart failure. Improvement in symptomatic endpoints (e.g., exercise tolerance) does not necessarily correlate with endpoints for improved survival (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction). It is therefore important to evaluate the effects of drugs on these distinct endpoints separately. Symptoms of heart failure are commonly managed with the use of diuretics, vasodilators, and positive inotropes or digoxin. Ideally, therapy should consist of a diuretic plus vasodilator (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine), with or without digoxin. Prevention of further left ventricular dysfunction can be accomplished by inhibiting neurohormonal processes and ventricular remodeling that occur in heart failure using ACE inhibitors, nitrates and hydralazine, or beta blockers. Significant therapeutic advances have been made with respect to symptom relief, hospitalizations, and mortality reduction in patients with congestive heart failure. Despite these advances, patient morbidity and mortality remain high and underscore the necessity for optimal use of existing therapies along with research directed at achieving further improvements in both quality of life and life expectancy.", 
    "735": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in patients with clinical signs of peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. One hundred patients, mean age 69 years (range 45-88) with symptoms and clinical signs of severe peripheral ischaemia, underwent aortography to determine the degree of peripheral vascular disease and possible renal artery stenosis. History of claudication and measurement of systolic distal blood pressure and calculation of the Ankle Brachial Index was used to define the severity of peripheral vascular disease. Thirty-one percent had renal artery stenosis (14% greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter). In a subgroup of patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease (n = 74), 34% had renal artery stenosis. In the subgroup of patients with renal artery stenosis, 81% had hypertension. Among patients with renal artery stenosis and lumen reduction of more than 50%, 93% had hypertension (p < 0.001). In conclusion this study shows that the combination of peripheral vascular disease and hypertension is an important clinical clue for renovascular disease. Examination for renovascular disease in this population should be considered, since the prevalence of the condition is high. Furthermore, examination for renal vascular disease in this population is mandatory, before treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is initiated, since treatment might lead to serious renal function impairment.", 
    "736": "The octapeptide hormone, angiotensin II, binds to two major subtypes of cell surface receptors: the AT1 and the AT2 angiotensin receptors. The important physiological and pathophysiological effects of angiotensin II on cardiovascular regulation and salt-water balance are mediated by the AT1 receptor subtype. As a consequence of the outstanding clinical success of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the appearance of AT1 receptor inhibitors in the therapy of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases was preceded with great expectations. The available experimental and clinical data indicate that the first AT1 receptor inhibitor, losartan, has the same therapeutic potential as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but it does not evoke the angiotensin-independent side-effects of ACE inhibitors, such as dry cough or angioedema. The physiological importance and the biochemical, molecular biological and pharmacological properties of AT1 and AT2 receptors are reviewed in this paper, and a summary of the available clinical data is presented.", 
    "737": "Angiotensin II exerts a mitogenic effect in several in vitro models, but a direct effect on erythroid progenitors has not been documented. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist, ameliorate posttransplant erythrocytosis, without altering serum erythropoietin levels. We studied erythroid differentiation and the effect of angiotensin II on proliferation of erythroid progenitors by culturing CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in liquid serum-free medium favoring growth of erythroid precursors. Aliquots of cells were collected every third day, and were used for RNA preparation. AT1 mRNA was detected after 6 d. In these same samples, erythroid-specific mRNA (erythropoietin receptor) was also detected. AT1 protein was detected in 7-d-old burst-forming units-erythroid colonies by Western blotting. The CD34+ cell liquid cultures were used to incubate erythroid precursors with angiotensin II from days 6-9. After incubation, cells were transferred to semisolid medium and cultured with erythropoietin. Angiotensin II increased proliferation of early erythroid progenitors, defined as increased numbers of burst-forming units-erythroid colonies. Losartan completely abolished this stimulatory effect of angiotensin II. Moreover, we observed increased numbers of erythroid progenitors in the peripheral blood of posttransplant erythrocytosis patients. Thus, activation of AT1 with angiotensin II enhances erythropoietin-stimulated erythroid proliferation in vitro. A putative defect in the angiotensin II/AT1 pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of posttransplant erythrocytosis.",
