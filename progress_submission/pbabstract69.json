Biochemical characterisation of the enzyme shows a glycoprotein with apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa. The Km and Kcat values for EPP hydrolysis are 0.624 mM and 694 s-1, respectively. Use of proteinase inhibitors shows the enzyme's metalloendopeptidase character. Moreover, captopril and lisinopril prevent the cleavage of EPP. The N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the purified protein corresponds to the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of swine kidney angiotensin-converting enzyme, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.15.1).", 
    "1": "We have previously shown that in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension little is gained by increasing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) over 12.5 mg when combined with an ACE-inhibitor. An increase in dosing was associated with more numerous side effects. The present study was designed to explore the relative efficacy of 12.5 and 6.25 mg of HCT in combination with captopril (C).", 
    "2": "For the study 25 patients with mild hypertension were recruited. Their mean age was 63 years (SD +/- 13 years). After a four week wash-out period and a dose finding phase of eight weeks, eight patients were stabilised at a diastolic pressure of <95 mmHg on C 50 mg + HCT 12.5 mg and 17 on C 25 mg + HCT 12.5 mg. These doses of C were continued throughout the study. The patients were then divided in two groups, receiving 12.5 mg or 6.25 mg of HCT for four weeks. The groups were then crossed over and treated for a further four week period. Finally, placebo was given for HCT for four weeks.", 
    "3": "Although the mean supine blood pressure was lower on HCT 6.25 mg than placebo by 5/3 mmHg this difference was not significant. The pressure fall on HCT 12.5 mg in comparison with placebo was significant (9/7 mmHg, p<0.02) and the supine systolic blood pressure was similarly significantly lower on HCT 12.5 mg than 6.25 mg (p<0.02). The mean serum-K was significantly reduced by HCT 12.5 mg but only two patients had values below 3.5 mmol/1 and none below 3.0 mmol/1. No change was observed in serum creatinine values. No significant increase was reported in side effects on HCT + C in comparison with placebo + C.", 
    "4": "This and our previous studies suggest an optimal dose of HCT of approximately 12.5 mg. A dose of 6.25 mg may not be without an antihypertensive effect. However, such an effect is likely to be modest.", 
    "5": "We investigated the potential role of increased plasma adrenomedullin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in a patient with malignant hypertension. A 51-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of visual disturbance. His blood pressure was 270/160 mmHg on admission. Papillary edema associated with retinal bleeding was observed. Echocardiography revealed marked concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild systolic dysfunction. Plasma levels of adrenomedullin and BNP were markedly elevated. Antihypertensive therapy reduced the plasma levels of adrenomedullin in association with a concomitant decrease in blood pressure. The plasma level of BNP also decreased and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and normalization of left ventricular systolic function were observed. Our findings suggest that adrenomedullin may be involved in the defense mechanism against further elevations in blood pressure in patients with hypertension and that the plasma level of BNP may reflect left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, or both, in patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "6": "Antihypertensive effects of an angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonist, candesartan cilexetil (TCV-116), were compared with those of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 2-kidney, 1-clip hypertensive rats (2K, 1C-HR) and 1-kidney, 1-clip hypertensive rats (1K, 1C-HR). CV-11974, the active form of TCV-116, had no inhibitory activity for plasma ACE. In rats, TCV-116 inhibited the pressor responses to Ang I, Ang II, and Ang III without an effect on the bradykinin (BK)-induced depressor response. Enalapril inhibited only the Ang I-response and potentiated the BK-response. In SHR, the antihypertensive effect of TCV-116 (10 mg/kg) was larger than the maximum antihypertensive effect of enalapril and was not intensified by combination with enalapril. Administration of CV-11974 potentiated the maximum antihypertensive effect of enalapril. Although both agents reduced blood pressure in 2K, 1C-HR, only TCV-116 had a marked antihypertensive effect in 1K, 1C-HR. These findings indicate that TCV-116 is more effective than enalapril in reducing blood pressure in SHR and 1K, 1C-HR, and that the BK- and/or prostaglandin-potentiating effect of enalapril contributes little to its antihypertensive mechanism in SHR.", 
    "7": "In subjects with coronary artery diseases (obstructive and vasospastic angina pectoris (AP)) who have no diabetes, hypertension, obesity and physical inactivity, insulin sensitivity was significantly reduced with compensated hyperinsulinemia on OGTT. Insulin resistance significantly correlated with coronary atherosclerosis score. In vasospastic AP (VAP), those who fulfilled more than 3 risk factors out of 5 (hyperinsulinemia, obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia) consist of 70 and 40% for smokers and nonsmokers respectively. Insulin resistance syndrome who fulfilled all the criteria was 9-10% for VAP. In atherothrombotic brain infarction (ATTI) with the same exclusion criteria, the similar insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia have been observed, but not in embolic (cardiac origin) or lacunar infarction. In ATTI, high TG and apo B with low HDL-chol were noted in blood. In essential hypertension without diabetes and obesity, hyperinsulinemia was noted in 25-35% and insulin resistance in 56-88%. Reduction of blood pressure with alpha blocker (bunazosin), ACE inhibitor (cilazapril), long-acting Ca++ blocker (amlodipine) significantly improved lowered insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance rather than hyperinsulinemia is more closely associated with blood pressure. Cardiovascular diseases (vasospastic and obstructive AP, brain cortical artery diseases) are prone to develop diabetes because of insulin resistance and also promote the generation of cumulative risk factors resulting in a vicious cycle. Efforts to alleviate insulin resistance is crucial for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "8": "Epidemiological evidence suggests that treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics increase the risk to develop diabetes. Prospective, randomized studies of antihypertensive drugs have demonstrated differences between different classes of drugs regarding effects on insulin sensitivity. Thus treatment with beta-blockers or diuretics is associated with impairment in insulin sensitivity, whereas most modern calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are neutral. However, captopril treatment seems to be different and result in improvement of insulin sensitivity. The most pronounced improvements have been obtained with alpha1-blockers. In populations at high risk for diabetes, it may be justified to select drugs that improve insulin sensitivity when treating hypertension in insulin resistant individuals.", 
    "9": "This is a brief overview of various mechanisms activated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition that affect the anatomy and function of the heart. The benefits of ACE inhibition include not only a reduction in blood pressure but also improved insulin responsiveness, prevention of potassium loss, diminished myocardial oxygen demand, suppression of catecholamines, and interaction with bradykinin and prostaglandins. These benefits result in improved perfusion of vital organs, diminished cardiac work, and protection of coronary vessels, evident in improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, elevation of the anginal threshold in ischemic heart disease, and decreased morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure. The cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibition have been demonstrated by numerous multicenter long-term trials.", 
    "10": "A corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test was performed on 7 patients with central diabetes insipidus (DI) and on 7 healthy subjects. The test was repeated on the patients with DI after 3 days of oral treatment with captopril at a dose of 100 mg daily. No significant difference in the responses of plasma ACTH and cortisol to CRH between the patients and the controls was found. The short-term captopril treatment resulted in a significant decrease of both basal and CRH-stimulated ACTH and cortisol levels in the patients with DI. CRH did not induce any changes in the stable metabolite of prostaglandin E2 13, 14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2-M) in the patients with DI before or after the captopril treatment. The results obtained suggest that vasopressin is not an obligatory factor for a normal ACTH response to CRH. Angiotensin II (A II) is involved in the regulation of ACTH. This study confirmed our previous data showing the lack of any specific effect of CRH on PGE2 production.", 
    "11": "1. The effect of tamsulosin (YM617, (R) (-)-S-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino] propyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide HCl), a potent and selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, was examined on urethral pressure profile (UPP) and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) in pentobarbital anaesthetized male dogs. 2. Selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists tamsulosin (1-100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), prazosin (1-100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) and bunazosin (1-100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) produced a dose dependent reduction in prostatic pressure in the UPP. Doses required to reduce prostatic pressure in UPP by 30% were 3.6 +/- 0.8 (n = 8), 6.9 +/- 1.5 (n = 8) and 4.6 +/- 0.9 (n = 8) micrograms kg-1 i.v., respectively. At the highest dose, tamsulosin exerted less hypotensive effect than prazosin and bunazosin. 3. The calcium antagonist nicardipine (0.1-10 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10-1,000 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) reduced MBP in a dose dependent manner, but exerted no effect on prostatic pressure in the UPP. The diuretic trichloromethiazide (1-100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) exerted no effect on UPP or MBP. Treatment with nicardipine (3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), captopril (100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) or trichlormethiazide (100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) did not affect relaxant effect of tamsulosin on prostatic pressure in UPP, or potentiate its hypotensive effect. 4. These results suggest that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor regulates urethral pressure as well as blood pressure in anaesthetized dogs, and that alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of micturition disorders associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. In addition, as tamsulosin decreased urethral pressure with less hypotension, and as its effect was not influenced by treatment with hypotensive drugs, it may be a useful drug for the treatment of micturition disorders with few cardiovascular side effects.", 
    "12": "1. The aim of this study was a pharmacological characterization of the multiple NANC inhibitory transmission systems producing relaxation of the circular muscle of guinea-pig proximal colon. In the presence of atropine (1 microM), guanethidine (3 microM) and of the tachykinin NK1 and NK2 receptor antagonists, SR 140333 (0.3 microM) and MEN 10627 (1 microM), respectively, electrical field stimulation (EFS) produced a frequency-dependent (0.1-3 Hz) relaxation. During a cumulative frequency-response curve, the maximal relaxant effect was produced at 3 Hz and approached the maximal relaxation to 1 microM isoprenaline. In the presence of both apamin (0.3 microM) and L-nitroarginine (L-NOARG, 100 microM), EFS failed to evoke relaxation up to 1 Hz; at 1-10 Hz, a slowly developing relaxation ensured which approached 50% of the Emax to isoprenaline. The EFS-evoked NANC relaxation, either in the presence or absence of apamin and L-NOARG, was unaffected by in vitro capsaicin pretreatment (10 microM for 15 min). 2. Three protocols of EFS were developed for further pharmacological analysis: (a) EFS at 1 Hz for 5 s in the presence of L-NOARG, producing a transient fast apamin-sensitive relaxation; (b) EFS at 1 Hz for 5 s in the presence of apamin, producing a transient fast L-NOARG-sensitive relaxation; and (c) EFS at 10 Hz for 5 s in the presence of both apamin and L-NOARG, producing a transient but slowly developing and more sustained relaxation. 3. The neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, thiorphan (1-10 microM), enhanced and prolonged the apamin- and L-NOARG-resistant NANC relaxation produced by EFS at 10 Hz, without affecting that evoked at 1 Hz in the presence of apamin or L-NOARG. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (1-10 microM) was without effect. 4. The cAMP analogue inhibitor of protein kinase A, Rp-cAMPs (100-300 microM) significantly reduced and shortened the NANC relaxation produced by 10 Hz EFS in the presence of L-NOARG without affecting that produced by 1 Hz EFS in the presence of apamin or L-NOARG. 5. The inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 3-10 microM for 60 min) abolished the 1 Hz EFS-induced relaxation in the presence of L-NOARG, and greatly inhibited that produced by 10 Hz EFS in the presence of both apamin and L-NOARG. The relaxation produced by 1 Hz EFS in the presence of apamin was inhibited by about 32% at 10 microM only. 6. Nifedipine (1 microM) did not affect the EFS-induced NANC relaxations. In the presence of nifedipine, tetraethylammonium (TEA, 1 mM) enhanced the 1 Hz EFS-induced relaxation in the presence of L-NOARG (158% of control) and that produced by 10 Hz EFS in the presence of apamin and L-NOARG (215% of control) while that evoked by 1 Hz EFS in the presence of apamin was slightly affected (109% of control). 7. In the presence of atropine, guanethidine, SR 140333 and MEN 10627, bath application of human vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP, 0.1 nM-10 nM) produced a concentration-dependent, slowly developing relaxation of colonic strips. The relaxation to VIP was unaffected by apamin (0.3 microM), L-NOARG (100 microM), nifedipine (1 microM) or nifedipine plus TEA (1 mM); it was inhibited by CPA (10 microM) and Rp-cAMPs (100 microM) and was potentiated by thiorphan (10 microM). 8. The putative VIP receptor antagonist, VIP(10-28) (10 microM) did not affect the VIP-induced relaxation nor the NANC relaxation to 10 Hz EFS in the presence of apamin and L-NOARG. 9. The present findings provide evidence that three distinct NANC inhibitory mechanisms mediate relaxation of the circular muscle of the guinea-pig proximal colon. The first system provides a fast relaxation in response to low frequency of stimulation and may involve the action of a transmitter(s) (possibly ATP) which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to the activation of apamin-sensitive K+ channels. The second system likewise provides a fast relaxation of the colon in", 
    "13": "An open multicentre study, performed in 340 overweight (body mass index: BMI > or = 25), hypertensive (95 mmHg < or = DBP < 115 mmHg) patients, evaluated the clinical and metabolic safety of trandolapril and confirmed its antihypertensive activity. After a two-week washout period, the patients received trandolapril 2 mg as a single morning dose for 12 weeks. Doubling of the dosage was authorized after the first four weeks when the DBP remained higher than 90 mmHg with a fall in DBP < 10 mmHg. Of the 287 patients who completed the study, 15.1% had to receive a double dose of trndolapril during the second treatment period. After four weeks of treatment, SBP was decreased by 18.6 mmHg, DBP was decreased by 13.4 mmHg and 63.1% of patients were controlled. After three months of treatment, SBP was decreased by 23.3 mmHg, DBP was decreased by 16.8 mmHg and 84.7% of patients were controlled. Subgroup analysis, according to the BMI (BMI > or = or < 30), showed that the fall in blood pressure was identical regardless of the BMI; the proportion of patients treated with a double dose of trandolapril was also independent of the BMI. A second subgroup analysis, according to the waist/hips ratio, did not reveal any difference according to the android or gynoid profile of excess weight. Twelve patients (3.9%) dropped out of the trial because of adverse events, 10 of which were attributable to treatment; 6.5% of patients reported an adverse effect attributable to treatment. Laboratory assays performed before and after three months of treatment demonstrated the very good metabolic safety profile of trandolapril, in view of the slight but significant reduction of total cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose. However, an average weight loss of one kilogram was reported. The global safety was considered to be good or excellent by the investigators in 94.8% of cases.", 
    "14": "The aim of our study was to compare the effect of captopril--the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, nifedipine--the calcium antagonist, and prazosin--the alpha blocker, on the secretory function of pancreatic beta-cells in hypertensive patients with NIDDM and with normal glucose tolerance. The effect of a 2-week treatment with nifedipine, captopril and prazosin upon glycaemia, serum insulin (IRI) and C-peptide (CP) following oral and intravenous glucose load were investigated in three groups, each including 10 non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension (h) and 10 hypertensive type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetics (h + d), aged 32-63 years. Nifedipine produced increase in glycaemia in the oral test in both groups. In the (h) group, but not in the (h + d) group, the drug caused reduction of the glucose-dependent increases in serum IRI and CP, more marked with respect to CP, as expressed by the decrease in the molar serum CP/IRI ratio. These results indicate that in non-diabetic patients, nifedipine reduces the early response of beta-cells to glucose, but this effect is partly compensated by a decreased insulin uptake by the liver. In patients with type 2 diabetes, this phenomenon does not become manifest because of absence or reduction in the early glucose-dependent insulin release. After captopril, lower values of glycaemia and serum IRI and CP were observed in both groups suggesting an improvement of insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, nifedipine has a small influence, and captopril and prazosin are devoided of any influence on the secretory function of pancreatic beta-cells. These drugs may be recommended for the treatment of hypertension in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.", 
    "15": "The open trial was designed to evaluate the effects of long-term antihypertensive treatment with the calcium-channel blocker, manidipine and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, delapril on insulin sensitivity in Japanese non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients with essential hypertension. We measured the insulin sensitivity index (SI) and the glucose-effectiveness (SG) by the use of Bergman's minimal model method in 18 hypertensive NIDDM patients before and after administration of manidipine (group A) or delapril (group B) for 3 months. Manidipine treatment for 3 months significantly improved SI in group A from 3.35 +/- 0.61 (x 10(-4) min-1 microU-1 ml-1) to 4.70 +/- 1.34 (P < 0.05). Delapril treatment for 3 months also significantly improved SI in group B from 3.56 +/- 1.04 to 5.00 +/- 0.87 (P < 0.05). Manidipine significantly improved SG in group A from 1.60 +/- 0.64 (x 10(-2) min) to 2.19 +/- 0.38 (P < 0.05). Delapril treatment also significantly improved SG in the group B from 1.41 +/- 0.56 to 1.91 +/- 0.35 (P < 0.05). Manidipine and delapril did not affect urinary C-peptide excretion for 24 h in the hypertensive NIDDM patients. Treatment with manidipine or delapril significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the hypertensive NIDDM patients. There were no differences between plasma glucose, serum total triglycerides, and cholesterol or lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, heart rate and body weight after 3 months on manidipine or delapril. This study confirmed the improving effects on SI and SG by long-term treatment with manidipine or delapril in the hypertensive NIDDM patients.", 
    "16": "Hypertension is associated with dysfunction of the immune system. Intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) was reportedly increased in immune cells, such as lymphocytes and thymocytes, both in hypertensive patients and in animals. To evaluate if captopril has an effect on the immune system, [Ca2+]i in thymocytes was monitored during the development of hypertension from 4-24 weeks, and after treatment with captopril for 4 and 12 weeks in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR (n = 24) were treated with captopril at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day at 12 weeks of age after establishment of hypertension. Untreated SHR (n = 17) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY n = 14) served as control. [Ca2+]i of thymocytes was measured using Fura-2. It was found that [Ca2+]i of thymocytes decreased both in SHR and WKY from 4-12 weeks of age. From 12-24 weeks, [Ca2+]i in thymocytes remained at a constant level in WKY. However, [Ca2+]i in thymocytes increased significantly in SHR after 12 weeks. Captopril (CAP) treatment significantly lowered [Ca2+]i in thymocytes derived from SHR at 24 weeks. This treatment was associated with a moderate reduction in systolic blood pressure. Established hypertension in SHR is associated with increased [Ca2+]i in thymocytes. This may be indicative of immunological dysfunction. Captopril inhibits the increase in [Ca2+]i of thymocytes in SHR.", 
    "17": "The SMART study (Self Measurement for the Assessment of the Response to Trandolapril) was a large scale trial conducted by general practitioners in order to assess the informative value of home self-measured blood pressure (BP) for the evaluation of therapeutic intervention. After a 2-week wash-out period, patients with office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 120 mm Hg received trandolapril, 2 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Four days of self-recorded BP were performed both at the end of the wash-out period and at the end of the treatment period with an automatic printerequipped device using the oscillometric method (A&D UA 751). Every day, a series of three consecutive measurements was planned in the morning before drug intake and repeated in the evening. A total of 1710 patients (946 men, 764 women) aged 56 +/- 11 entered the study. In the 816 patients who correctly performed self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) during both periods and followed the protocol schedule, office BP (SBP/DBP) decreased from 166.4 +/- 15/101.4 +/- 6 mm Hg to 144.7 +/- 14/86.1 +/- 8 mm Hg while SMBP decreased from 153 +/- 18/94 +/- 10 mm Hg to 139 +/- 16/85 +/- 10 mm Hg. A weak correlation was found between the two methods with regard to systolic (r = 0.47, P < 0.0001) and diastolic (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001) BP lowering. Individual response to therapy varied between the two methods: 633 patients (77.6%) exhibited at least a 10 mm Hg office DBP decrease while 493 (60.4%) presented at least a 6 mm Hg self measured DBP decrease in the evening; 65% of patients were considered as responders with both methods. The 24-h therapeutic coverage was assessed by the morning to evening BP decrease ratio (M/E ratio) which represents the ratio of the trough effect to the 12-h post dosing efficacy. Both population and individual M/E ratios ranged between 73% and 86% thus confirming the long duration of action of trandolapril.", 
    "18": "(1) discrepancies between office and self-measured BP evaluation of therapeutic response have been pointed out: agreement between the two methods is obtained in only 65% of patients, mainly due to intra-individual BP variability and recording conditions; and (2) self-measured BP could be a potential tool to explore the 24-h therapeutic coverage.", 
    "19": "Diuretics typically provoke increased serum lipid levels and may provoke increased serum uric acid levels and/or glucose intolerance. Furosemide is widely used as an antihypertensive, but in patients for whom furosemide treatment alone proves insufficient to reduce hypertension, a common procedure is to co-administer the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. The metabolic effects in rats of joint administration of furosemide (15 mg/kg/day) and captopril (2 mg/kg/day) are evaluated over a two-week period. At the end of this period, the serum levels of lipids, uric acid, bilirubin, proteins and various enzymes were determined as well as the effect of the treatment on intestinal absorption of glucose and calcium. Furosemide/captopril led to an increase in serum albumin and alkaline phosphatase levels, and a decrease in triglyceride levels. The results of this work support the view that this drug combination is suitable for hypertension treatment.", 
    "20": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) caused by systemic hypertension, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure is associated with pathological changes in the structure of the heart, collectively described as remodelling (see part 1 of this review). The reversal of remodelling, termed cardioreparation, might restore cardiac structure and function towards normal, thereby improving the prognosis of these conditions. We aimed to explore the medical implications of this concept.", 
    "21": "Clinical trials of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other drugs in patients with hypertension, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure were reviewed. The results showed that ACE inhibitors induce regression of LVH in hypertensive patients, reduce mortality in acute myocardial infarction, and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction subsequent to myocardial infarction. These observations are consistent with cardioreparation by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "22": "ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure. Theoretical considerations and some clinical observations suggest that these benefits might result from cardioreparation.", 
    "23": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is common in patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure and in survivors of myocardial infarction. It is associated with increased risks of adverse cardiovascular events, including angina, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. We aimed to explain these observations in terms of changes in the structure of the heart, collectively described as remodelling.", 
    "24": "Laboratory investigations of animal models of cardiovascular diseases were reviewed. The most prominent features of remodelling are myocyte hypertrophy, excessive accumulation of collagen in the heart (myocardial fibrosis) and pathological changes in the coronary blood vessels. Remodelling disrupts the structure of the heart and impairs its pumping function and blood supply. The reversal of remodelling, termed cardioreparation, could restore cardiac structure and function towards normal and improve the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "25": "Cardioreparation implies the regression of myocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Myocyte hypertrophy is primarily a response to chronic pressure or volume overload of the ventricles, whereas myocardial fibrosis depends on activation of circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce blood pressure and inhibit these systems. They might therefore induce cardioreparation.", 
    "26": "The i.v. infusion of a low dose of the cholecystokinin agonist caerulein elicited a sustained secretion of amylase into the biliopancreatic duct of rats. Pretreatment with the bradykinin antagonist icatibant (Hoe-140) had no effect on unstimulated amylase release and did not affect caerulein-induced amylase secretion. An i.v. infusion of bradykinin in doses not producing a pancreatic oedema elicited an increase in pancreatic juice production lasting 20-40 min after the end of the infusion. This pro-secretory effect was also visible at higher doses in captopril-pretreated rats producing an oedema similar to that observed in caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Using the Monastral blue method, it was found that the kininase II blocker captopril induced an opening of endothelial gaps in pancreatic capillaries. This effect was blocked by icatibant suggesting that kinins are formed in the pancreas under basal conditions. Thus, kinins appear not to be involved in the regulation of the production of digestive enzymes. However, kinins may have a modulatory role in the production of pancreatic juice and in the microcirculatory regulation in the pancreas.", 
    "27": "In this study we explored the possibility that angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) is involved in the control of blood pressure at the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) by determining the effect of angiotensin antagonists (DuP 753 and A-779) and the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramiprilat on the pressor action produced by angiotensin I (Ang I). The pressor effect produced by bilateral microinjection of Ang I into the RVLM of anesthetized rats was not significantly altered by DuP 753 or by the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat. Conversely, the Ang-(1-7) antagonist, A-779, reduced significantly the pressor effect produced by Ang I. These data suggest that in our experimental condition Ang I was preferentially converted to Ang-(1-7) at RVLM, or that Ang I and/or one of its fragments acts through a receptor blocked by A-779.", 
    "28": "BK destroying activity was observed in rat isolated heart perfusates. BK was optimally degraded at pH 8.4 in rat heart. The results indicated that myocardial kinin degradation was due to ACE and a serine protease. These results suggest that bradykinin may have some cardioprotective role during myocardial ischaemia at acidic pH.", 
    "29": "Captopril (10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the arterial bradykinin (BK) level (Art-BK) of non-treated Sprague-Dawley rats (SD), determined by an ELISA, from 10.8 +/- 3.2 pg/ml to 32.9 +/- 5.4 pg/ml significantly (p < 0.05, n = 6). Intravenous infusion of BK (100-3000 ng/kg/min) dose-dependently increased heart rate (HR) and decreased mean blood pressure (MBP), the former at lower doses than the latter, and the hypotensive response became significant at 3000 ng/kg/min. Art-BK determined during infusion of the lowest dose of BK (100 ng/kg/min) was 12 times the endogenous Art-BK after captopril administration. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, Wistar Kyoto rats, and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt treated hypertensive rats, Art-BK (450-1280 pg/ml) determined during intravenous BK-infusion (1000-3000 ng/kg/min), which induced significant hypotension, was 20 to 100 times the endogenous Art-BK (4.5-64 pg/ml) with captopril treatment. These results suggest that the increased Art-BK due to inhibition of kinin degradation by captopril could not account for the hypotension due to this angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in normotensive and hypertensive rats.", 
    "30": "All components of an intracerebral kallikrein-kinin system have been described. Thus, bradykinin (BK) acting from the parenchymal site as well as from the blood site may influence cerebral microcirculation. BK is a potent dilator of extra- and intraparenchymal cerebral arteries when acting from the perivascular site. The vasomotor effect of BK is mediated by B2 receptors which appear to be located at the abluminal membrane of the endothelial cell. The effect of BK is mediated by NO. prostanoids, free radicals, H2O2 or leukotrienes depending on the animal species and on the location of the artery. Selective opening of the blood-brain barrier for small tracers (Na(+)-fluorescein; MW, 376) has been found in cats during cortical superfusion or intraarterial application of BK. This leakage is mediated by B2 receptors located at the luminal and abluminal membrane of the endothelial cells. Formation of brain edema has been found after ventriculo-cisternal perfusion or interstitial infusion of BK. This can be explained by increase of vascular permeability and cerebral blood flow due to arterial dilation thus enhancing driving forces for the extravasation. An increase of the BK concentration in the interstitial space of the brain up to concentrations which induce extravasation, dilatation and oedema formation has been found under several pathological conditions. Thus, BK may be involved in oedema formation after cold lesion, concussive brain injury, traumatic spinal cord and ischemic brain injury. The mediator role of BK in brain edema is further supported by therapeutic results. Brain swelling due to cold lesion or ischemia could be diminished by treatment with kallikrein-inhibitors. Similarly, dilatation of cerebral arterioles after concussive brain injury was reduced by blockade of B2 receptors. Thus, all criteria favour BK as one mediator of vasogenic oedema.", 
    "31": "Growing evidence points to the existence of the components of the kallikrein-kinin-system (KKS) in cardiac and vascular tissue forming systemic and local KKS pathways involving different cell types like endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Kinins may contribute to the regulation of the cardiovascular system in health and disease and to the pharmacological effects of cardiovascular agents via autocrine-paracrine mechanisms. Based on observations from experimental models of hypertension, hypertrophy, ischemia, remodelling and preconditioning one can assume that modulation of local KKS pathways is instrumental for endogenous cardio- and vasculoprotective mechanisms. The role of kinins as possible mediators of such protective mechanisms is not only based on the existence of their generating pathways and their release, but also on observations that kinins, when given locally or being increased by inhibition of their breakdown, exert beneficial cardiovascular effects, whereas antagonism of their receptors worsens these effects. Indispensable pharmacological tools like ACE inhibitors and kinin receptor antagonists have helped to clarify these assumptions, which are now further elucidated by molecular biology and by clinical research. Especially the wealth of experimental and clinical findings with ACE inhibitors present a continuous challenge to investigate the role of kinins in the cardiovascular system and to have a closer look at the interdependence of KKS and the Renin-Angiotensin-System (RAS). Within our decade one might not only reach a clearer molecular perception of kinins in the cardiovascular system, and their role in human health and disease, but might also come to improved innovative treatment by modulation of the KKS pathways.", 
    "32": "We have recently demonstrated that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramiprilat augments the endothelium-dependent dilator response to bradykinin in the isolated perfused rat heart by an interaction at the B2 receptor level. We have now investigated whether this is an effect of the ACE inhibitor class of compounds by studying the bradykinin-induced vasoconstriction in isolated segments of the rabbit jugular vein. Among five different ACE inhibitors, moexiprilat and ramiprilat proved to be the most effective in potentiating the constrictor response to bradykinin. This effect was not mimicked by other protease inhibitors or the synthetic ACE substrate hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine. The ACE inhibitors, on the other hand, failed to affect the constrictor or dilator responses elicited by other receptor-dependent agonists in this vascular model. These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitors selectively potentiate the B2 receptor-mediated constrictor response to bradykinin in the rabbit jugular vein, possibly by increasing the affinity of the B2 receptor.",

In the first case, biopsies showed granulomatous sarcoid-like lesions; in the second, bronchial wall eosinophil infiltratf2p4was reported with increased blood eosinophil count. In these two cases, improvement was obtained by withdrawal of the drug and was completed with steroids. All other causes were ruled out. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced pneumonitis is still rare but has to be recognized as a real side-effect.", 
    "35": "Twenty four male hypertensive patients suffering also from peripheral obstructive arterial disease were randomly subdivided in two groups and after a period of farmacological wash-out of one month Group I was treated with Captopril (C 50 mg bid) or Ticlopidine (T 250 mg bid) for three months and then with the association C plus T for three months again. After placebo administration for one month, patients were further treated with C plus T at low doses (25 mg bid and respectively 250 mg daily). In the first part of the study, patients of Group II received an inverse sequence of the drugs (before Ticlopidine 250 mg bid and then Captopril 50 bid). In both groups of patients C induced a significant decrease of blood pressure and an increase of PFWD, TWD, and WI. T did not modify blood pressure but slightly increased PFWD, TWD, and WI. The improvement was more evident during administration of C plus T, whereas placebo administration induced a trend toward baseline values. Finally, the chronic administration of C plus T for twelve months induced a further improvement of all considered parameters. In conclusion, chronic administration of C plus T may be useful in the treatment of hypertensive patients suffering from intermittent claudication, improving significantly PFWD and TWD.",

All high blood pressure was significantly reduced by the three regimens (p < 0.005), but no significant difference in blood pressure control by any individual regimen was noted. Double product also showed the similar trend. Therapy A achieved the best reduction of double product among three regimens, but statis tieally insignificant. Furthermore therapy A suppressed the RAS, whereas therapies B and C might activate this system. Concomitantly, therapy A also had significant favorable effects on metabolic responses in contrast to therapy C. Therapy B revealed a neutral effect on such responses.",

    "44": "1. In patients with congestive cardiac failure, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors results in peripheral vasodilatation and an increase in cardiac output without an increase in heart rate, which suggests a positive inotropic effect. This cannot be explained by changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin concentrations that occur. ACE has been suggested to also metabolise vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which is a positive inotrope. As VIP is synthesized by the heart and acts locally to increase cardiac output, we postulated that ACE inhibition would increase the myocardial concentration of VIP. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received enalapril (2 mg/kg per day) in their drinking water or no therapy for 7 days. On day 7 the rats were anaesthetized and blood was sampled. Hearts and kidneys were then harvested and snap frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Concentrations of VIP in plasma and tissue extracts were measured by radioimmunoassay. 3. Plasma and renal concentrations of VIP did not change in enalapril-treated rats. However, the myocardial concentration of VIP increased significantly in rats receiving enalapril compared with control animals (P < 0.0005). 4. We conclude that treatment with ACE inhibitors results in increased myocardial VIP concentrations and suggest that this may contribute to the improvement in cardiac function that occurs with these agents.", 
    "45": "1. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ameliorates human and experimental diabetic nephropathy, possibly as a result of changes in angiotensin II (AngII) and/or bradykinin concentrations. However, ACE is an indiscriminate enzyme, which hydrolyses numerous vasoactive peptides at two catalytic sites that are thought to be substrate specific. AngI is cleaved at the C-terminal site, bradykinin at both the C- and N-terminal sites, while other substrates may be preferentially cleaved at the N-terminal site. Of the various ACE inhibitors, some (e.g. perindopril) bind preferentially to the C-terminal site while others (e.g. enalapril) bind to both. We compared the efficacy of perindopril and enalapril in the diabetic SHR to determine whether all the benefits of ACE inhibition derive from changes in the concentrations of C-terminal related substrates. 2. Diabetes was induced by tail vein injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) in 14 week old SHR. Blood glucose was maintained at 4-8 mmol/L by daily ultralente insulin injection and rats were randomized to control, enalapril (10 mg/kg per day) or perindopril (4 mg/kg per day) groups. Blood pressure, creatinine clearance and urinary protein excretion were monitored for 3 months. 3. Blood pressure in both treatment groups was lower than in control (perindopril P < 0.0001; enalapril P < 0.0001). Levels were marginally higher in the perindopril group than the enalapril group, although this difference was significant only in the second month (P < 0.025). Creatinine clearance was significantly lower in the perindopril group (0.44 +/- 0.05 mL/min) than in either the control rats (0.85 +/- 0.11 mL/min; P < 0.001) or the enalapril-treated group (0.66 +/- 0.05 mL/min; P < 0.005). Proteinuria was also lower in this group (4.3 +/- 0.9 mg/24h) than in the enalapril-treated (11.3 +/- 5.8 mg/24h; P < 0.05) or control groups (32.1 +/- 4.5 mg/24h; P < 0.0005). 4. The difference in efficacy between perindopril and enalapril that we have observed suggests that the benefits of ACE inhibition derive from changes in the concentrations of peptides catalysed by the C-terminal rather than the N-terminal site.", 
    "46": "1. The effect of high and low dose angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and the contribution of bradykinin potentiation in this treatment on left and right ventricle weights and wall volume was investigated in immature spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Male SHR were treated from 7 to 11 weeks of age with perindopril (an ACE inhibitor) at a low dose of 0.1 mg/kg per day or a high dose of 1 mg/kg per day. Half the animals were also treated with a bradykinin receptor antagonist, HOE 140 (500 micrograms/kg per day). 3. After 4 weeks of treatment, hearts were arrested in diastole and perfusion fixed. The right and left ventricle plus septum were weighed, cut into 1 mm slices and volume was determined using the Cavalieri principle. 4. Low dose perindopril treatment did not significantly affect blood pressure in the SHR. High dose perindopril treatment maintained blood pressure at a level similar to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. 5. Growth of the right ventricle was not influenced by ACE inhibition. However, high dose treatment significantly lowered the left ventricle plus septum volume:bodyweight ratio (LV + S VOL:BWT) compared with control SHR (2.85 +/- 0.02 vs 3.36 +/- 0.08 mm3/g, respectively) to a level similar to the normotensive WKY rats (2.80 +/- 0.11 mm3/g). Similarly, low dose treatment significantly lowered the LV + S VOL:BWT ratio (2.89 +/- 0.09 mm3/g). HOE 140 treatment did not reverse the effect of ACE inhibition. Similar effects were observed on left ventricular weights. 6. ACE inhibition, independent of its blood pressure lowering effect, prevents the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in the SHR but does not influence growth of the right ventricle. This effect of ACE inhibition does not appear to be mediated by bradykinin potentiation.", 
    "47": "1. In the present study, New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rats were treated with valsartan, a specific angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonist, to measure the effects on blood pressure (BP), cardiac hypertrophy and the structure of resistance arteries. Normotensive (N) rats were used as controls. 2. Valsartan (val) was given to GH rats at three different doses (10, 3 or 0.3 mg/kg per day, via osmotic mini-pumps implanted i.p.) from age 4-10 weeks. Untreated GH (mini-pump + vehicle) and N rats (mini-pump + vehicle) were used as controls. BP was measured weekly and at the end of the experiment, left ventricular (LV) mass was recorded and the structure of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) was determined using stereological methods. 3. BP fell in a dose-dependent fashion, being reduced to normotensive levels by 10 mg/kg; LV mass was significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) to below normotensive values in the GH group given 10 mg/kg val and significantly reduced (P < 0.001), although not normalized, in the other two treatment groups. 4. In MRA, the media/lumen (M/L) ratio was reduced by val according to dose level, to below normotensive values in GHval10, and to levels not different from normotensive values in the GHval3 and GHval0.3 groups. 5. The hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells in GH rats was reduced with val treatment at all doses. 6. Reversal of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy occurred even when BP was not reduced to normotensive levels, indicating an effect on vessel growth but without any retardation of body growth. 7. These results suggest that the vascular structural changes seen after val and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment are probably due to the blocking of angiotensin rather than any bradykinin effect.", 
    "48": "1. Chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or AT1 antagonism during postnatal development in the rat has been shown to cause renal tubular and vascular damage, particularly in the outer medulla. 2. The effects of ACE inhibition were investigated at a stage of development before the renal outer medulla is fully established. 3. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were given daily i.p. injections of either enalapril or saline from days 3-10. At day 11, kidneys were perfusion-fixed for either electron microscopy or immunocytochemistry. Sections were incubated in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antisera and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used to detect an immunoreactive product, indicative of proliferating cells. 4. Following enalapril treatment, the normal structural arrangement of the outer medulla was disrupted compared with controls. Cell proliferation (PCNA-positive cells) in the medullary rays was reduced in enalapril-treated kidneys compared with control kidneys. 5. Thus, angiotensin II appears to be essential for normal tubular and vascular growth in postnatal renal development in the rat.", 
    "49": "Some controlled clinical trials showed a beneficial effect of beta-blockers on symptoms, exercise tolerance, and left ventricular function in dilated cardiomyopathy.

Eighty-four surviving patients had a complete 2-year noninvasive follow-up period. Ten patients died or were transplanted before the final assessment. Improvement was defined according to a clinical score based on left ventricular ejection fraction (increase > or = 10 U), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (decrease > or = 10%), regression of restrictive filling pattern, New York Heart Association functional class, exercise tolerance (increase > or = 2 minutes), and cardiothoracic ratio (decrease > or = 10%). According to these criteria, 48 patients (51.1%) were classified as improved. Multivariate analysis identified a group of patients with a history of mild hypertension (blood pressure between 140/90 and 170/100 mmHg) and significantly higher probability of improvement with longterm metoprolol (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-3.94; P = .007).

Eleven of 24 patients completed a 6-month treatment period with captopril monotherapy (50 mg twice a day).

Neither acute nor chronic therapy with captopril had a significant effect on plasma concentrations of Ang II. Although plasma levels of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha were not modified by a first exposure to captopril, the concentrations of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha but not prostaglandin E2 rose significantly in subjects treated with the inhibitor for 6 months.

In each patient the difference between clinic and daytime average blood pressure was taken as a surrogate measure of the magnitude of the 'white-coat effect', separately for systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

Both for systolic and for diastolic blood pressure, the reduction in clinic blood pressure caused by treatment was directly related to the clinic-ambulatory difference before treatment, but inversely related to the magnitude of that difference persisting during treatment. The clinic-ambulatory blood pressure difference observed before placebo was attenuated during placebo, the magnitude of the attenuation being similar to that found under drug treatment. No significant difference between clinic and daytime average heart rate was ever observed before and during active treatment or placebo.",

This leads to an overestimation of the effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment when this is assessed by clinic blood pressure measurements only. This overestimation is greater in subjects with an initially greater difference because in these subjects the subsequent attenuation is greater. Because similar phenomena are observed with placebo, the attenuation in the difference during drug treatment is likely to reflect merely habituation to clinic blood pressure measurements with time.",

    "79": "Over the last 2 decades, we have learnt that focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a ubiquitous phenomenon underlying the progressive deterioration of many different types of renal diseases in both pediatric and adult populations. FSGS may also be the primary renal lesion, whether in new disease entities such as glycogen storage disease and human immunodeficiency virus infection, or in idiopathic FSGS. Although the mechanism which triggers the development of primary FSGS still remains unknown, laboratory and clinical studies have identified several key pathophysiological events leading to end-stage renal disease. While therapeutic modalities have not changed remarkably, a recent study, although uncontrolled, demonstrated an impressive efficacy of intravenous steroid pulse therapy in inducing remission. Nevertheless, it remains largely unknown whether such a forced remission decreases the overall risk of developing chronic renal failure. Studies have revealed an important pathophysiological role of angiotensin and the therapeutic efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in progressive loss of renal function in diseases where glomerulosclerosis is secondary; however, it remains to be verified whether these results hold true in primary FSGS. As a result of the improvement in allograft survival rate, the benefit of renal transplant outweighs the risk of recurrence of FSGS, hence transplantation continues to be a vital therapy for FSGS patients who have reached renal failure. Thus, FSGS is not one disease, but rather a range of lesions seen in many settings. The type of lesions and the patient's unique genetic factors contribute to prognosis, and also may dictate choice of optimum therapy.", 
    "80": "Coumarin derivatives combine 3 unfavorable properties which make them prone to potentially life threatening drug-drug interactions: (i) high protein binding; (ii) cytochrome P450 dependent metabolism; and (iii) a narrow therapeutic range. An entire list of drugs which are supposed to interact with coumarins (mostly with warfarin) comprises about 250 different compounds. Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. There are several other drugs which enhance the hypoprothrombinaemic response to coumarins by various mechanisms: inhibitors of the elimination of the eutomer S-(-)-warfarin (e.g. miconazole, phenylbutazone), combined with protein binding displacement (e.g., sulfinpyrazone, phenylbutazone), synergistic hypoprothrombinaemia (e.g. cefazoline). Furthermore, bleeding complications may occur with drugs affecting platelet function [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Strong inducers of coumarin metabolism are rifampicin (rifampin) and carbamazepine. Biphasic interactions may occur where a drug first enhances the hypoprothrombinaemic response to a coumarin but has a sustained inducing effect on coumarin metabolism (e.g. phenytoin or sulfinpyrazone). The complex response of coumarins to concomitant drug therapy makes it difficult to predict the occurrence and degree of a deterioration of anticoagulant control in individual patients. For clinical practice, it seems advisable that one should monitor for changes in prothrombin time when adding or deleting any newly approved drug or any drug suspected (e.g. on the basis of this review) to cause an interaction to patients on coumarin therapy. The onset of the adverse prothrombin time response might be from between 1 to 2 days up to 3 weeks (in case of phenprocoumon) after starting a concomitant drug regimen. With amiodarone, an adverse prothrombin time response might occur up to 2 months after initiating therapy. For heparins, only a drug interaction with aspirin or nitroglycerin seems clinically relevant due to the possibility of coadministration during acute cardiac events. Both drugs are shown to enhance the activated partial thromboplastin time response to heparin.", 
    "81": "In patients with essential hypertension, correlations have been reported between the albumin excretion rate (AER) and ambulatory and casual blood pressure. Microalbuminuria has been indicated as a possible predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of quinapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue affinity for the enzyme, on the AER in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no evidence of diabetes mellitus. In this 12 week, 24 center study, quinapril was administered to 213 patients and titrated to 10, 20, or 40 mg/day alone or 20 mg/day plus 12.5 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide. Overall, blood pressure was reduced from 155.2 +/- 18.1/101.8 +/- 6.7 mm HG (mean +/- SD) to 144.4 +/- 17.8/92.3 +/- 8.9 mm HG (P = .0001) and AER decreased from 20.6 +/- 24.3 mg/24 h to 14.5 +/- 15.4 mg/24 h (P = .0001). The BP reductions were significant in all age groups. AER at endpoint was reduced 37.5% in elderly, 29.8% in middle-aged, and 11.8% in young patients from 32.5 +/- 45.0 mg/24 h, 19.1 +/- 20.9 mg/24 h, and 16.1 +/- 16.9 mg/24 h, respectively. The AER decreased in 60% of patients who had normal AER (0 to 30 mg/24 h), in 79% of those who had microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 h), and in 90% of those who had proteinuria (> 300 mg/24 h) at baseline. Baseline log-AER correlated with SBP (P = .0126, R = 0.19) and creatinine clearance (P = .026, R = 0.17), while endpoint log-AER correlated with SBP (P = .0015, R = 0.25) and DBP (P = .03, R = 0.17). In summary, we showed, in a large group of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and no evidence of diabetes mellitus, that quinapril not only lowers BP significantly but also reduces microalbuminuria.", 
    "82": "A growing body of data support the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the prevention of cardiac enlargement and improvement of left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, very little information exists about the direct effect of increased afterload on cardiac performance in these patients and the possible favourable effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as adjunctive treatment to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates. We have, therefore, studied the effects of captopril as adjuvant therapy to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates (standard therapy) on left ventricular performance in 77 consecutive patients with uncomplicated Q-wave acute myocardial infarction, by the measurement of the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio before and after (0.25-0.50 mg) phenylephrine administration on the 4th and 30th post-infarction days. Patients were randomized on day 4 either to continue standard therapy alone (group 1, 35 patients) or to receive oral captopril therapy (12.5 mg t.i.d.) in addition to standard therapy (group 2, 42 patients) in a double-blind parallel study. Among the patients of group 1 there was a significant deterioration of left ventricular function after phenylephrine administration. This was shown by an increase of pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio only in the subset of patients with ejection fraction < 40%, as measured by contrast ventriculography, on both the 4th and 30th post-infarction days changing from 0.435 +/- 0.070 to 0.528 +/- 0.101, P < 0.01 and from 0.404 +/- 0.098 to 0.515 +/- 0.092, P < 0.02, respectively. In contrast there were no significant changes in patients with ejection fraction > or = 40%. Among patients of group 2, phenylephrine administration induced a significant increase, only on the 4th day, in pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio only in the subset of patients with ejection fraction < 40% changing from 0.410 +/- 0.107 to 0.535 +/- 0.102, P < 0.01. In the remaining patients with ejection fraction > or = 40% there were no significant changes on either the 4th or 30th post-infarction days. Furthermore, a significant improvement was observed after phenylephrine administration in the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio between the 4th and 30th post-infarction days, which changed from 0.535 +/- 0.102 on day 4 to 0.368 +/- 0.052 on day 30 (P < 0.004). Also, a four-way ANOVA detected a significant reduction of heart rate in patients with ejection fraction < 40% from day 4 to day 30. The results indicate that: (1) the response of pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio after increasing afterload may be a useful non-invasive method for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction in myocardial infarction patients; and (2) captopril adjuvant therapy as compared to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates alone, after phenylephrine administration, improves the left ventricular performance response in asymptomatic Q-wave post-infarction patients and beneficially affects heart rate. This effect is most pronounced in patients with ejection fraction < 40% whereas those with ejection fraction > or = 40% do not obtain clear benefit.", 
    "83": "A longitudinal study for six months was conducted to demonstrate the influence of enalapril therapy on microalbuminuria in a group of patients with IDDM without arterial hypertension. An evaluation was also considered of its possible activity on other biochemical parameters, particularly plasma lipid levels. Thirty-four patients with IDDM were selected, with a mean age of 26.1 +/- 7.2 years and a mean clinical course of 11.8 +/- 5.6 years. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) was confirmed lower than 140/85 mmHg in all cases. Patients were administered 5 mg/day of enalapril and if a decrease in microalbuminuria higher than 25% was not achieved at the end of the first month of therapy, the dose was doubled (10 mg/day). No significant differences were found in ABP and in HbA1c throughout the study period. Albumin excretion in the initial period was 125.1 +/- 79.28 mg/24 h, at one month in the follow-up 47.6 +/- 44.1 mg/24 h, at three months 23.8 +/- 18.1 mg/24 h, and at the end of the 6th month 15.33 +/- 6.9 mg/24 h, all differences being significant. Renal function parameters and Na+ and K+ measurements remained unchanged for the follow-up period. No significant changes were detected for lipid and lipoprotein values for the length of the study. We conclude that therapy with enalapril in insulin-dependent diabetic patients without hypertension has an important effect on microalbuminuria during the first month of therapy; a stabilization in the normal range was reached in the third and sixth months of follow-up. No changes in arterial blood pressure nor in renal function were observed. Plasma lipid values were in the normal range throughout the study. Therefore, treatment for microalbuminuria with the ACEI assayed was efficient, in absence of arterial hypertension and irrespective of the metabolic control obtained. Future long-term studies are needed to evaluate the possible delay in the emergence of renal insufficiency.", 
    "84": "Our hypothesis is that regulation of the lung vessel tone and microvascular permeability may be disrupted in chronic heart failure (CHF) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may contribute to their readjustment. This hypothesis is based on the fact that KII-ACE, the same enzyme that converts angiotensin I and inactivates bradykinin, is highly concentrated in the luminal surface of the lung vessels and its blockade in CHF may reduce their exposure to an excess of angiotensin II and augment the action of prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO) deriving from local kinin hyperconcentration. We probed whether ACE-inhibitors influence the pulmonary function; this is peculiar of CHF; they act as KII- or ACE-blockers. Aspirin was utilized as a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor. We investigated 16 CHF patients and 16 age- and sex-matched normal volunteers or mild untreated hypertensives. All were non-smokers, not taking ACE-inhibitors, aspirin or other cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Pulmonary function tests, exercise testing with respiratory gases and echocardiography were performed in the run-in and repeated at the end of placebo, enalapril (10 mg t.i.d.), enalapril plus aspirin (325 mg/day) and aspirin given in random order and double-blind fashion for 15 days each. Enalapril, as compared to placebo, caused an increase in mean voluntary ventilation (MVV) and alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in CHF, that were counteracted by the addition of aspirin. Aspirin alone was not effective. Enalapril and aspirin were ineffective on the pulmonary function of controls. As to the functional capacity, enalapril increased exercise tolerance time, oxygen consumption (VO2p), minute ventilation (VEp) tidal volume (VTp) and reduced the ratio of volume of dead space gas (VDp) to VTp (VD/VTp), at peak exercise in CHF patients. These effects all were inhibited by the combination of aspirin and were not observed in controls. In CHF VO2p changes from placebo correlated with those in DLCO (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001) and not with those in ejection fraction. This correlation was abolished by aspirin and was not seen in controls. Variations in VD/VTp in CHF patients while on enalapril were related to those in DLCO (r = -0.69, p = 0.003). In CHF the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide production per minute at 1 liter was diminished with enalapril and not in combination with aspirin. Derangements related to CHF are the substrate for benefits of ACE-inhibition on pulmonary function and exercise capacity. Pulmonary diffusion limitation is an important mediator of exercise impairment and its improvement with enalapril goes in parallel with VD/VT, MVV, VT, VE to VCO2 relationship and not with ejection fraction. These patterns reflect changes occurring within the lung that are not related to left ventricular function. The counteracting influence of aspirin on these affects bespeaks a substantial participation of prostaglandins that might readjust capillary permeability and lung interstitial fluid content or alveolar capillary membrane diffusing capacity.", 
    "85": "Tubular overwork is thought to be a promoter of the tubular hypertrophy and renal failure that occur in response to renal mass reduction. Because Na-K-adenosinetriphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase) is an index of tubular work, we evaluated the effects of subtotal nephrectomy and of enalapril therapy, which delays the evolution of renal lesions, on tubular hypertrophy and Na-K-ATPase activity along the rat nephron. Within 6 wk, 70% reduction of renal mass engendered hypertrophy of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), thick ascending limb (TAL), and collecting duct (CD), as well as parallel increments in Na-K-ATPase activity per millimeter tubule length (Na-K-ATPase activity per unit surface area was not modified by subtotal nephrectomy). Chronic enalapril therapy prevented part of the hypertrophy (but not Na-K-ATPase stimulation) of the PCT and the whole stimulation of Na-K-ATPase (but not hypertrophy) in the CD, whereas it had no effect on the TAL. Enalapril effect on Na-K-ATPase in CD might result from reduced bradykinin metabolism, as the reduction in urinary excretion of bradykinin observed in subtotally nephrectomized rats was prevented by enalapril therapy.", 
    "86": "In passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) or a low dietary protein intake decreases albuminuria (UAlbV). Although this reduction in albuminuria appears to result from an improvement in glomerular permselectivity, the effect of these treatments on albumin permeation and absorption by the nephron has not been clarified. This study used micropuncture techniques to examine the effect of these two treatments on albumin permeation (by measuring the delivery of albumin to the proximal tubule) and the tubular absorption of albumin. PHN rats (12-18 days after injection of FX1A) were switched from 23% to either 40% protein diet (HP), 40% protein diet and concomitantly treated with enalapril (40 mg.kg-1.day-1) (HPE), or to 8% (LP) protein diet for 4-6 days. Although left kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not differ among the groups, UAlbV from the left kidney in LP and HPE was only 20-40% of that observed for the HP group. In protocol 1, the fractional recovery of albumin (FRAlb) in urine was calculated following injection of artificial tubular fluid containing [14C]inulin and 125I-labeled albumin into the earliest identifiable proximal loops. There were no differences in FRAlb among the three groups. In protocol 2, timed quantitative collections of tubular fluid were obtained from proximal tubular loops. The rate of albumin delivery to the earliest accessible loops of the proximal tubule was significantly lower for the LP and HPE groups compared with the HP group. For each group, albumin concentration corrected for water absorption was not altered along the proximal tubule. The data indicate that alterations of dietary protein intake or ACEI treatment results in large changes in the delivery of albumin at the proximal tubule that could singularly account for the changes in urinary albumin excretion.", 
    "87": "To determine the role of the renin-angiotensin system and the bradykinin pathway in the mechanism of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure, the acute effects of enalaprilat (1 mg/kg) were compared with those of a renin inhibitor (ciprokiren, 1 mg/kg i.v.) in 10 chronically instrumented conscious dogs with heart failure induced by right ventricular pacing (3 wk, 240 beats/min). The effects of enalaprilat and ciprokiren on bradykinin infusion (3, 10, and 30 micrograms/min) and the effects of enalaprilat in the presence of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe-140 (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) were also examined. Both inhibitors significantly decreased mean aortic pressure and increased cardiac output. However, enalaprilat induced significantly greater hemodynamic effects than ciprokiren (mean aortic pressure, -13 +/- 3 vs. -6 +/- 1 mmHg; cardiac output, 0.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.1 l/min). Bradykinin infusion led to dose-dependent decreases in mean aortic pressure and increases in cardiac output that were not modified by pretreatment with ciprokiren but were potentiated 10-fold by enalaprilat. Hoe-140 significantly reduced the hemodynamic effects of enalaprilat. Thus endogenous bradykinin is involved in the acute hemodynamic effects of enalaprilat in experimental heart failure.", 
    "88": "1. This study was undertaken to determine whether the AT1 receptor directly contributes to hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy and gene expressions. 2. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were given orally an AT1, receptor antagonist (losartan, 30 mg kg-1 day-1), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 10 mg kg-1 day-1), a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist (amlodipine, 5 mg kg-1 day-1), or vehicle (control), for 8 weeks (from 16 to 24 weeks of age). The effects of each drug were compared on ventricular weight and mRNA levels for myocardial phenotype- and fibrosis-related genes. 3. Left ventricular hypertrophy of SHRSP was accompanied by the increase in mRNA levels for two foetal phenotypes of contractile proteins (skeletal alpha-actin and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC)), atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP), transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) and collagen, and a decrease in mRNA levels for an adult phenotype of contractile protein (alpha-MHC). Thus, the left ventricle of SHRSP was characterized by myocardial transition from an adult to a foetal phenotype and interstitial fibrosis at the molecular level. 4. Although losartan, enalapril and amlodipine lowered blood pressure of SHRSP to a comparable degree throughout the treatment, losartan caused regression of left ventricular hypertrophy of SHRSP to a greater extent than amlodipine (P < 0.01). 5. Losartan significantly decreased mRNA levels for skeletal alpha-actin, ANP, TGF-beta 1 and collagen types I, III and IV and increased alpha-MHC mRNA in the left ventricle of SHRSP. Amlodipine did not alter left ventricular ANP, alpha-MHC and collagen types I and IV mRNA levels of SHRSP. 6. The effects of enalapril on left ventricular hypertrophy and gene expressions of SHRSP were similar to those of losartan, except for the lack of inhibition of collagen type I expression by enalapril. 7. Unlike the hypertrophied left ventricle, there was no significant difference between losartan and amlodipine in the effects on non-hypertrophied right ventricular gene expressions of SHRSP. 8. Our results show that hypertension causes not only left ventricular hypertrophy but also molecular transition of myocardium to a foetal phenotype and interstitial fibrosis-related molecular changes. These hypertension-induced left ventricular molecular changes may be at least in part mediated by the direct action of local angiotensin II via the AT1, receptor.", 
    "89": "Technetium-99m-ethylenedicysteine (99mTc-EC) captopril scintigraphy performed in a patient with severe hypertension revealed increased parenchymal retention in the left kidney, suggesting renal artery stenosis. After angiographic confirmation of renal artery stenosis, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed on the left renal artery. Captopril scintigraphy after PTA showed normal findings with no evidence of parenchymal retention, consistent with reversal to normal kidney functions. In light of this case of renal artery stenosis, it was concluded that 99mTc-EC can be used successfully as a potential renal agent in the diagnosis and follow-up of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "90": "We studied the effect of imidapril, a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on lifespan expectancy of cardiomyopathic (CM) hamsters of BIO 14.6 strain, one of the representative models of congestive heart failure (CHF). Imidapril was consecutively administered to hamsters by mixing it in their diet at a concentration of 480 ppm (approximately 30 mg/kg/day) or 1,600 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) from age 26 weeks. Only several control hamsters died before age 54 weeks, but their survival rate decreased to 23.7% at age 73 weeks. The survival rates of 480-ppm and 1,600-ppm imidapril groups at age 73 weeks were as high as 75.7 and 68.4%, respectively (p < 0.01 vs. control hamsters). Macroscopic and microscopic pathology in imidapril-treated groups was milder than that in control animals in general, but differences were not statistically significant when animals were divided into survivors and fatalities except for the presence of mural thrombus in the heart. We further studied the effects of imidapril on blood pressure (BP), in vivo cardiac function, cardiac beta-adrenoceptor distribution, and plasma catecholamine levels after dietary treatment with 480 ppm imidapril for 8-10 weeks from age 37 weeks. Imidapril-treated animals showed improved cardiac function under urethane anesthesia. These results indicate that imidapril prolongs lifespan expectancy of CM hamsters and suggest that a hemodynamic effect of imidapril is involved in its beneficial effect.", 
    "91": "To assess the effects of antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril on insulin sensitivity, plasma insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism in overweight hypertensive patients, we measured the insulin sensitivity index (SI, determined according to the minimal model method of Bergman), fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, serum total triglyceride and lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, and blood pressure (BP) in 30 overweight [mean body mass index (BMI) 30.9 kg/m2], nondiabetic patients with essential hypertension after a 4-week run-in period and after 6 weeks of perindopril (n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) administered in a double-blind fashion. Furthermore, we estimated their state of physical fitness using the Conconi bicycle ergometer test before and after perindopril or placebo administration. SI was low in our study population (3.2 vs. 13.3 10(-4) ml.microU-1.min-1 in normal lean control subjects). It did not differ between the perindopril and placebo group after the placebo run-in period (3.1 vs. 3.3 x 10(-4) ml.microU-1.min-1) and was not influenced by perindopril (3.3 x 10(-4) ml.microU-1.min-1) or placebo (3.6 x 10(-4) ml.microU-1.min-1) treatment. Moreover, no significant changes were apparent in fasting plasma insulin and glucose, the areas under the glucose and insulin curves, the glucose disappearance rates, serum total triglycerides (TG), or cholesterol or lipoprotein cholesterol fractions between run-in and active treatment phases in the perindopril or the placebo group, respectively. Heart rate (HR), body weight, and anaerobic threshold remained stable in both groups. Compliance, assessed by pill counting was > 90% in both groups at all visits. Therefore, the ACE inhibitor perindopril is neutral with regard to insulin sensitivity, plasma insulin and glucose, and lipoprotein metabolism in overweight, nondiabetic patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "92": "Congestive cardiac failure is characterised by redistribution of blood flow to the brain and the heart at the expense of the kidneys. The prognosis of this condition at its most advanced stage (stage IV) is poor with a mortality of about 50% at 5 years. The reduction of renal perfusion will lead to stimulation of all vasoconstrictor and anti-natiuretic mechanisms, and to a parallel activation of vasodilator and natiuretic systems. There is, therefore, a clear conflict of interest between the heart, which attempts to preserve its perfusion and function, and the kidneys which aggravate the haemodynamic disturbances by salt and water overload and the risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. The diuretics and ACE inhibitors are essential therapeutic classes for the treatment of congestive cardiac failure. The prevention of the secondary effects of diuretics and ACE inhibitors on renal function, serum sodium, potassium and magnesium concentrations, is based on an initial low dose prescription, the detection and correction of risk factors and strict clinical and biological surveillance. In order to avoid the risks of hyperkalaemia during the association of ACE inhibitor and diuretic therapy with a potassium sparing agent, the initial dose of these two drugs should be as low as possible.",

These mechanisms include the activation of a series of neurohormonal systems: the sympathetic nervous system, the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin arginine, endothelin, which are basically vasoconstrictors, with the counterpoint of other vasodilator systems, such as the endothelial relaxation factor, certain prostaglandins and the bradykinin-kallikrein system, which modulate global response. The authors review the physiopathology of each of these system, as well as their significance in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of heart failure. We analyze the possible deleterious effects of neurohormonal activation, anatomically and at cardiovascular function level, and try to determine if they are capable of explaining the evolution and progression of heart failure, in a truly vicious circle, up until the irreversible heart failure phase. We review the current importance of the inhibition of the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system in the prophylaxis and treatment of heart failure. Furthermore, we describe the present-day value of the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system in some forms of heart failure. We also analyze the different pharmacological treatments for heart failure: diuretics, inotropic agents, vasodilators (in their different pharmacological types), paying particular attention to their action on neurohormonal systems and their implications in the prognosis and evolution of heart failure.", 
    "101": "Nitric oxide production has been reported to be reduced in hypertensive patients. In this study, we investigated the effects of antihypertensive drugs such as calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, doxazosin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, imidapril on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the kidneys of L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats. An increased blood pressure in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats was significantly decreased by these antihypertensives to the same extent at four weeks. Nitrite production from the kidney slices was significantly suppressed in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats. This suppression of nitrite production was reversed to the control level in the rats treated with amlodipine, and significantly enhanced by doxazosin and imidapril. Immunoreactivity for both the brain-type NOS in the macula densa and endothelial cell-type NOS in renal vasculature was diminished in L-NAME rats, and antihypertensive therapies, especially doxazosin and imidapril, increased NOS immunostaining. The increased glomerulosclerosis score in the L-NAME group was significantly lowered by the treatment with doxazosin and imidapril. In conclusion, a decreased NOS activity in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats was significantly increased by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockers and ACE inhibitors in the kidney, and this increased NOS activity may have a role in the prevention of glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "102": "TCV-116 and enalapril were given in two stages: (early phase) for 6 to 10 weeks to 5/6 nephrectomized (NX) rats two weeks after nephrectomy, 12-week-old Wistar fatty (WF) rats and 7-week-old spontaneously hypercholesterolemic (SHC) rats; and (late phase) for 6 to 16 weeks to 5/6 NX rats 11 weeks after nephrectomy, 27-week-old WF rats and 10-week-old SHC rats. Urinary albumin, blood pressure (BP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal histology were examined. In the early phase, both agents inhibited proteinuria and tended to inhibit glomerulosclerosis. TCV-116 also inhibited interstitial inflammation. The antiproteinuric effects did not necessarily correlate with the BP-lowering effects. In the late phase, both agents showed equal antiproteinuric and antihypertensive effects. In 5/6NX and WF rats, TCV-116 inhibited tubulointerstitial inflammation/fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis and renal dysfunction, but enalapril had little effect on these parameters. In the SHC rats, TCV-116 inhibited renal tubulointerstitial inflammation and glomerulosclerosis, but enalapril inhibited only glomerulosclerosis. After drug administration, there was a positive correlation between proteinuria and BP, and a negative correlation between the severity of tissue damage and GFR, but not BP. These findings suggest that initial BP-independent tubulointerstitial inflammation may enhance glomerulosclerosis in the late phase, and TCV-116 might prevent the development of glomerulosclerosis through inhibition of angiotensin II-mediated tubulointerstitial damage in these models.", 
    "103": "The effects of the treatment with benazepril (BEN) on blood pressure and renal function have been evaluated in nine adult patients affected by mild to moderate hypertension. BEN was administered orally, at a single daily dose of 10 mg for four weeks. BEN induced a clinically significant decrease in blood pressure, from a mean basal value of 155/98 mm Hg (+/- 15/7 SD) to 146/92 (+/- 12/9) after seven days of therapy and 139/88 (+/- 11/10) after 28 days in supine position and from 152/104 (+/- 17/6) to 144/97 (+/- 14/6) after seven days and 145/99 (+/- 16/9) after 28 days in a standing position. Plasma urea, creatinine, uric acid and their clearances as well as urine enzymes (GGT, ALP, LDH) remained stable throughout the duration of the therapy. GFR showed a modest increase, from 61.3 +/- 13.2 ml/min to 65.3 +/- 18.3 ERPF showed a slightly more evident increase, from 246.7 +/- 68.1 ml/min to 276.9 +/- 75.6. Plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides were not influenced by BEN. Plasma potassium increased from 4.0 +/- 0.3 to 4.4 +/- 0.5 mEq/liter. The results of this study indicate that BEN is a safe and effective antihypertensive agent that does not cause any adverse renal or metabolic effects.", 
    "104": "The effects of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with quinapril on adrenergic transmission were determined in 18 patients with moderate essential hypertension. Plasmatic renin activity, catecolamines, and aldosterone as well as vascular reactivity after norepinephrine and angiotensin II perfusion were determined before and after treatment with the ACE inhibitor quinapril up to 40 mg/day during four months. In the responder patients (patients with a casual diastolic blood pressure decrease > 5 mm Hg determined at the beginning of the second vascular reactivity study, (N = 9) a decrease of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and a slight increase of vascular reactivity was found. Non-responder patients (N = 9) did not show any significant changes in these parameters. These results demonstrate that the hypotensive effect of quinapril may be related not only to the inhibition of RAS, but also to the blockage of the adrenergic system.", 
    "105": "Hypertension present in more than 50% of successfully renal transplanted patients and its prevalence has slightly increased since the introduction of cyclosporine A. Twenty patients, 9 women and 11 men aged from 30 to 58 years, with stable cadaveric renal allograft function and moderate to severe hypertension, were included in the study. Renal artery graft stenosis causing hypertension were excluded. All patients were given triple drug immunosuppressive treatment with methylprednisolone, azathioprine and cyclosporine A (CsA) and their hypertension was treated with a nifedipine dose of 20 mg twice daily. To evaluate the effect of ACE inhibitors on renal hemodynamics and hypertension, a 4 mg/daily dose of perindopril was added to the above regimen for two months. Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) decreased from 208 +/- 54 to 168 +/- 61 ml/min and renal vascular resistance (RVR) increased from 75 +/- 12 to 88 +/- 17 mm Hg/ml/min (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Mean blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by the combination of both agents in comparison to the blood pressure control by monotherapy with nifedipine. It is suggested that the combination of both antihypertensive agents was more effective than monotherapy with nifedipine in controlling blood pressure, but less favorable on the renal hemodynamic response in hypertensive renal transplant patients who were maintained on CsA.", 
    "106": "The effects of 3, 15, and 27 months of treatment with nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/day) and enalapril (5 to 20 mg/day) on diastolic blood pressure (DBP), overnight urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were studied prospectively in a parallel group design in 13 microalbuminuric non-insulin dependent diabetic patients with mild hypertension and biopsy-proven diabetic glomerulopathy. Throughout the study period DBP decreased in both groups to < 95 mm Hg. At three months UAE, GFR, and RPF did not change significantly. At 15 and 27 months UAE (microgram/min, geometric mean and 95% C.I.) decreased respectively from 47.4 (23.4 to 95.9) to 28.6 (10.3 to 79.4), and to 22.3 (10.9 to 45.2; P = 0.0005) with nitrendipine, and from 58.3 (30.3 to 110.9) to 44.1 (22.9 to 84.8), and to 14.7 (4.4 to 49.3; P = 0.0025) with enalapril. Four patients in each group were normoalbuminuric at 27 months and none became macroalbuminuric. At 15 months the GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2, mean +/- SD) increased from 69.5 +/- 15.2 to 96.6 +/- 22.0 (P < 0.05) with nitrendipine and from 58.9 +/- 10.7 to 78.5 +/- 11.0 (P < 0.05) with enalapril. At 27 months the GFR was still numerically higher that at baseline either with nitrandipine (81.2 +/- 7.8) and with enalapril (79.9 +/- 17.7) (P = 0.7). The RPF (ml/min/1.73 m2, mean +/- SD) at baseline and at 27 months was comparable either with nitrendipine (456.6 +/- 165.3 vs. 400.9 +/- 112.9) and with enalapril (400.3 +/- 81.3 vs. 399.0 +/- 123.7). Both treatments were well tolerated. This is the first evidence that long-term effective control of arterial blood pressure by a calcium channel blocker or by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in addition to reducing albuminuria, also improves GFR in incipient nephropathy.", 
    "107": "A trial to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nitrendipine and enalapril in the treatment of diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria (MA) was performed to compare the effects of both drugs in the prevention of the renal impairment. Twenty-eight valid patients [13 with nitrendipine (N) and 15 with enalapril (E) with NIDDM, hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 90 to 114 mm Hg) and MA (urinary albumin between 30 to 300 mg/24 hr) were recruited in a double blind, randomized trial. Following a placebo run-in period of two to four weeks, all eligible patients were randomly allocated to either N or E treatment. Treatment lasted six months, with two different visits at three and six months in which blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), renal function and MA were measured. No statistically significant differences on BP and metabolic parameters were found between both treatment groups. The geometric mean of final glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the N group was 34.5% higher than in the E group, while the reduction on MA was most important in the E group. Eleven patients reported adverse events (AEs) and there were four dropouts, three of them due to AEs. We conclude that both treatments are a good choice for treating diabetic hypertensive patients with early altered renal function, as they reduce BP without altering metabolic parameters, increase GFR and reduce MA with a low frequency of AEs.", 
    "108": "There are a lack of studies about elderly patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). We studied 22 patients, aged 64 to 74 years, who were diagnosed with hypertensive nephropathy (HN), defined as a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 95 mm Hg and a basal creatinine clearance (CCr) of 52 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73 m2. During the minimum two-year follow-up, the progression of renal failure (RF) was analyzed by the plotted slope of CCr versus time. Patients were divided into two groups, each administered one of two different drugs, Ca antagonists (group I) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (group II). The DBP in both groups was lowered by the end of the study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was less in group I (97.35 +/- 5.98 mm Hg) than in group II (108.3 +/- 9.95 mm Hg). The decline in renal function was a mean rate of -0.62 +/- 0.36 ml/min/month in group I and -1.03 +/- 0.17 ml/min/month in group II. In conclusion, we show that patients who were on ACE inhibitors exhibited a greater MAP and a greater decline in renal function compared with the patients who were on Ca antagonist therapy. We also found that patients who were younger than 70 years old had better control of their blood pressure rates and less of a rate of decline in renal function than their older counterparts.", 
    "109": "More than other drugs, angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to provide better control of glomerular hypertension and improved preservation of renal function. Long-term treatment with captopril slows the progression of renal impairment in diabetic nephropathy; however, the data are inconclusive for non-diabetic nephropathies. ACE inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril, alacepril delapril cilazapril, and lisinopril were equally effective in reducing blood pressure in multicenter clinical trials focusing on renal hypertension in Japan. We studied the influence of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and the effects of hypertension therapy in 104 patients with chronic renal glomerulonephritis as diagnosed by renal biopsy. Patients were subdivided into hypertensive, normotensive and hypotensive groups according to ABP and ages. Hypotensive subjects showed an improvement, while normotensive subjects showed a slower rate of progression of renal function loss than hypertensive patients. This suggests that the adequate ABP levels were 100 to 125/55 to 75 in those who were less than 40 years old, 100 to 135/60 to 80 mm Hg in patients aged 40 to 60, and 105 to 140/60 to 85 mm Hg in those over 60 years old. The renal protective effects of calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors were associated with a reduction in blood pressure, but not with the hypotensive action.", 
    "110": "This study defines the nature of the renal protective effects of calcium channel blockers (Ca blockers) and the effects of the Ca blocker, amlodipine, compared to those of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril, on the progression of renal injury in 5/6 nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fed a high-salt diet. Furthermore, we studied the effects of various Ca blockers on the glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles using the isolated perfused hydronephrotic kidneys of six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. In the first study, forty 6-week-old male SHRs which underwent 5/6 nephrectomy were equally divided into five groups. One group received no therapy. In two groups, therapy was started at four weeks post-nephrectomy, one with amlodipine and the other with enalapril. In the remaining two groups, amlodipine or enalapril therapy was started at eight weeks postnephrectomy. Amlodipine was more effective than enalapril in reducing proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in the group that was started on drug therapy eight weeks after surgery. In the second study, at concentrations of 10(-6) to 10(-9) M, nifedipine, nicardipine and amlodipine dilated the afferent, but not the efferent, arteriole preconstricted with angiotensin II. On the other hand, efonidipine and manidipine clearly dilated angiotensin II-induced constriction of both the afferent and efferent arterioles. These results indicated that Ca blockers are effective at reducing renal injury in 5/6 nephrectomized SHR, and that they are more effective than ACEI in advanced stages of renal injury. The observation that only certain Ca blockers can dilate the efferent arteriole suggests that the renal protective effect of Ca blockers is not necessarily dependent on the dilation of the efferent arterioles.", 
    "111": "Although the fetal aorta expresses a substantial amount of angiotensin II type 2 receptors, the expression level of angiotensin II type 2 receptors in the adult aorta and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells is very low or even absent. Prolonged serum depletion (6 to 8 days) with a supplement of insulin, transferrin and sodium selenite induced angiotensin II type 2 receptors and mRNA in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from Wistar Kyoto rats. Insulin was found to be essential for the induction of the receptor. However, these receptors could not be induced in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results suggest that: (1) insulin plays an important role for the expression of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor gene; and (2) the type 2 receptor gene expression is differentially regulated between cultured vascular smooth muscle cells of Wistar Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "112": "Several new non-peptide, orally active, angiotensin II receptor antagonists have recently been developed which enable to block the renin-angiotensin system at the AT1 receptor site. In contrast to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, these antagonists do not interfere with the metabolism of kinins. The effect of these agents on renal function may thus potentially differ from those of ACE inhibitors. Therefore, the renal pharmacology of various angiotensin II receptor antagonists has been examined in normotensive subjects. In normotensive subjects, losartan and irbesartan have been shown to have no effect on glomerular filtration rate and to induce either no change or a modest increase in renal blood flow. These results were confirmed thereafter in hypertensive patients where losartan produced a renal vasodilation with no change in glomerular filtration. In healthy subjects, both losartan and irbesartan induce an acute increase in urinary sodium excretion. The natriuretic response to losartan is proportionally more important during salt-depletion. In contrast to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, losartan has a unique property to increase uric acid excretion. In this paper we show that this property is due to the potent inhibitory effect of the parent compound of losartan on the urate/anion transport in the human renal proximal tubule.",

    "116": "There is now considerable evidence that nitric oxide (NO) production and action are abnormal in patients with heart failure. Spontaneous NO release from the vascular endothelium is preserved or enhanced in patients with heart failure and this may help to maintain tissue perfusion by blunting the vasoconstriction induced by various neurohumoral factors. On the other hand, endothelial NO release in response to various stimuli including exercise appears to be diminished and this may contribute to the impaired exercise capacity of patients with heart failure. It is now apparent that NO produced within the heart plays an important role in the modulation of cardiac contractility under physiological conditions. In patients with heart failure, however, increased myocardial NO production in response to cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha may contribute to reduced contractility and myocyte injury. Our understanding of the role of NO in the control of vascular tone has provided an explanation for the efficacy of nitrovasodilators in heart failure and has stimulated novel approaches to augmenting endogenous vascular NO production. There is also evidence that ACE inhibitors act to restore normal endothelial function in patients with heart failure. Increased NO production within the heart, particularly that produced via the pro-inflammatory inducible NO synthase, may be detrimental. It remains to be determined whether selective inhibition of inducible NO synthase can favourably modify the course of this lethal condition.", 
    "117": "To assess the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on insulin action in obesity, five normotensive non-diabetic obese women were examined on two occasions as part of a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study involving ten days of treatment with either 1.25 mg ramipril or placebo. The study consisted of a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp (two periods of insulin infusion at rates of 0.4 and 1 mU/kg/min, 2 h for each step) combined with indirect calorimetry. The most notable results involved a significantly faster time-course of glucose infusion rates during the first 30 min of each insulin infusion period [analysed by calculating slopes (S1 and S2)] after ramipril than placebo administration. The mean glucose infusion rates reached during the last 30 min of each insulin infusion period (G1 and G2), as well as the increases in carbohydrate oxidation rates during the clamp (C1-C0 and C2-C0) and the decreases in plasma nonesterified fatty acids (A0-A1 and A0-A2), were not significantly different after ramipril and placebo. According to robust principal component analysis of S1, S2, G1, G2, C1, C2, A1 and A2 (orthogonally to C0 and A0), insulin sensitivity was improved with ramipril as compared to placebo (p = 0.013). This study strongly suggests that a low dose of an ACE inhibitor increases the activation phase of insulin action in normotensive nondiabetic obese patients and may accelerate insulin action.",

In contrast, renal vascular changes were also prevented by nifedipine. (iii) Only ACE inhibitors effectively inhibited podocyte hypertrophy and mesangial cell hyperplasia. Whether the superior effect of ACE inhibitors on glomerulosclerosis is related to inhibition of glomerular growth and podocyte hypertrophy as well as preservation of podocyte structure, or whether these findings are merely a passive reflection of greater efficacy, remains unresolved.", 
    "140": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition has been shown to attenuate arterial contractions, but the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified in detail. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 10-week-long quinapril therapy (10 mg kg-1 day-1) on responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. The hypertrophy of cardiac muscle and mesenteric arterial smooth muscle was effectively reduced in SHR by quinapril treatment. Maximal contractile force generation to 5-hydroxy-tryptamine was reduced in endothelium-intact and -denuded rings of quinapril-treated SHR when compared with untreated SHR. Contractile sensitivity of endothelium-intact rings to 5-hydroxytryptamine was also attenuated in SHR by quinapril, whereas no differences were found between the study groups in sensitivity of endothelium-denuded rings. Inhibition of NO synthesis by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased the sensitivity and contractile force generation of endothelium-intact rings to 5-hydroxytryptamine more effectively in quinapril-treated than in untreated SHR, whereas indomethacin had only minor effects on the responses in the study groups. Maximal responses and sensitivity to norepinephrine were also reduced in SHR by quinapril and were more effectively increased by NG-nitro-L-arginine in quinapril-treated than in untreated SHR. In addition, KCI-induced maximal contractions of endothelium-denuded rings were attenuated in quinapril-treated SHR. However, when the release of norepinephrine from vascular adrenergic nerve endings was eliminated by sympathectomy, no differences were found in maximal KCI-induced contractions between the study groups; this suggests that diminished contractions to KCI in quinapril-treated SHR resulted from reduced release of endogenous norepinephrine from vascular nerve endings during depolarization. The inhibitory effects of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine on arterial contractions in the Wistar-Kyoto rat groups and the quinapril-treated SHR were similar and were lower than in untreated SHR. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that effective reversal of cardiovascular hypertrophy, normalization of the function of voltage-dependent calcium channels, sympathoinhibitory action and enhanced endothelium-derived NO release can explain the attenuated arterial constrictor responses that occur after the long-term inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "141": "Hypertension in women has received little attention in comparison to men. There are only a handful of studies focusing on women with hypertension. Nevertheless, the data provide some information on the prevalence of hypertension in women, complications and the effectiveness of treatment. The Framingham Study showed that blood pressure (BP) increased with age in both men and women. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program study demonstrated that hypertension was much more prevalent in men than women. However, in the postmenopausal group more than half were hypertensive. High BP is prevalent in older women. In absolute values, the complication rate is lower in women than in men but increases with age. At all levels of BP, the morbidity and mortality associated with BP is lower in women than men. Nevertheless, there is a five- to sixfold increase in risk in hypertensive compared with normotensive women. Furthermore, hypertensive women with a myocardial infarction have a worse prognosis than men. No study data using newer agents such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are available yet. Since antihypertensive treatment appears to be effective in smokers, cessation of smoking is a very important intervention. Studies such as the European Working Party on Hypertension in Elderly, Systolic Hypertension in Elderly, Swedish Trial of Old Patients with Hypertension, and Medical Research Council 1992 have recruited patients 60 years of age and older, mainly women. These trials have shown that in the elderly hypertensive all-cause mortality is reduced by 30%, stroke by 33%, congestive heart disease mortality by 20% and heart failure by 40% to 50% with treatment. However, even these newer trials have used the so-called \"old medications'. Studies using \"newer drugs' are in progress.", 
    "142": "In 5 separate exercise capacity trials in similar patients with chronic congestive heart failure performed in Europe, the United States, and South Africa, 627 patients were randomized to ramipril and 428 to placebo. The dose of ramipril ranged from 1.25 to 20 mg/day. Follow-up was at 12 or 24 weeks. None of the trials were designed to assess efficacy with regard to clinical outcome. To assess in the combined experience whether there was an effect of ramipril on mortality, hospitalization, functional classification (New York Heart Association class), and exercise capacity, we pooled data from each trial and performed a mata-analysis. Of the patients randomized to ramipril and placebo, respectively, and based on intention to treat, 14 (2.2%) and 18 (3.8%) patients died (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 1.29), and 59 (9.4%) and 67 (14.3%) patients died or were hospitalized (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 1.00). The New York Heart Association class improved in 29% and 25% respectively, whereas 8% and 15% deteriorated (p=0.04, based on intention to treat; death and hospitalization considered as deterioration). In ranked comparisons based on intention to treat and with imputation of exercise time as 0 for patients who were unable to exercise because of death or who were hospitalized, exercise capacity was significantly improved by rampril. We concluded that rampiril is likely to have an effect on mortality, morbidity, and functional capacity in patients with chronic congestive heart failure similar to that of other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "143": "Nitrate tolerance has been reported to be reversed by certain types of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We examined whether alacepril, a new long-acting oral ACE inhibitor, has beneficial effects against exercise-induced angina in patients with stable effort angina after substantial isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) treatment. Thirteen men with stable effort angina were treated with oral ISDN (80 mg/d) for >3 weeks. After this period, efficacy of single oral administration of either alacepril (50 mg) or its placebo on exercise-induced angina and electrocardiographic changes was examined by treadmill exercise test in a double-blind crossover design. Alacepril significantly improved the exercise duration by 9.1% (p=0.03), the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression by 19% (p<0.01), and the maximal ST-segment depression by 33% (p=0.015) compared with placebo. Alacepril did not significantly alter the rate-pressure product, a marker of myocardial oxygen demand, during exercise test compared with placebo. Plasma renin activity was significantly increased (p<0.05) after administration of alacepril, indicating that alacepril significantly blocked ACE activity in our patients. In conclusion, a single oral administration of the ACE inhibitor alacepril (50mg) elicited beneficial effects against exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with stable effort angina during chronic nitrate treatment. These effects may be mediated by increased coronary blood flow.", 
    "144": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke and is associated with alterations in vascular structure and function. The aim of this study was to determine vascular function, wall morphology, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) arrangement in basilar arteries from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive control strain Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The effect of perindopril treatment on SHRSP structure and function was also assessed.", 
    "145": "VSMC orientation was determined with laser-scanning confocal microscopy and computer-assisted image processing in basilar arteries stained with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (wavelengths: excitation, 488; emission, 515) or propidium iodide (excitation, 529; emission, 550). Measurements of wall morphology and functional responses to serotonin and KCl were assessed with wire myography.", 
    "146": "In the WKY basilar arteries, VSMCs were uniformly oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vessel, whereas in the SHRSP there were localized foci of VSMC geometric disorganization, with a significant deviation from 90 degrees. The SHRSP basilar arteries also showed structural remodeling and reduced contractile responses to serotonin and KCl. Perindopril treatment normalized blood pressure, prevented wall morphology alterations, and improved function but had no effect on VSMC disorganization.", 
    "147": "This is the first demonstration of lesions of VSMC geometric disorganization in a cerebral artery from a stroke-prone genetically hypertensive rat strain. These structural abnormalities are independent of blood pressure. Their functional sequel may play a role in the pathogenesis of stroke in this model.", 
    "148": "Captopril, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Captopril is known to be associated with dermatologic, hematologic, and pulmonary adverse effects. However, hepatotoxicity is extremely rare. A patient with severe cholestatic jaundice induced by captopril is presented. On admission to the hospital, the patient was diagnosed and treated as having cholangitis. Review of the literature showed similar occurrences in other patients. Patients treated with captopril who develop \"atypical cholangitis\" should be suspected of having captopril-associated liver damage.", 
    "149": "Although calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in lowering blood pressure, no long-term data show their effect on morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. They are suggested as alternative initial therapy in hypertensive patients. Short-acting calcium channel blockers are to be used with caution or not at all in the treatment of hypertension. Nonhydropyridine calcium channel blockers may reduce the incidence of second infarction but not congestive heart failure or mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease. The ACE inhibitors increase insulin sensitivity and decrease intraglomerular pressure. In combination with a diuretic, they are the preferred agents in the treatment of diabetic patients with hypertension, especially those with nephropathy. In both hypertensive and normotensive patients, ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from congestive heart failure in patients with poor left ventricular function who are also being treated with a diuretic and/or digitalis. They do not, however, reduce strokes or myocardial infarctions in hypertensive patients.", 
    "150": "The combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium antagonist has a synergistic effect in patients with more severe hypertension. However, when this combination fails to control blood pressure, it is not clear which drug is then additive. The aim of this work was to study in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design the effect on blood pressure of the addition of either a thiazide diuretic (bendrofluazide, 5 mg once daily) or a beta-blocker (atenolol, 100 mg once daily) or placebo each for a month in hypertensive patients who are not adequately controlled on the combined treatment of amlodipine 5 mg once daily and lisinopril 5 mg twice daily. Eighteen patients with a supine diastolic pressure of more than 90 mm Hg after at least 1 month on the combined treatment of amlodipine and lisinopril were enrolled in the study. The results show that in patients whose blood pressures are not controlled by the combination of amlodipine and lisinopril, the addition of bendrofluazide 5 mg once daily causes a significant fall in blood pressure compared with placebo and a significantly greater fall than 100 mg atenolol once daily.", 
    "151": "The influence of heart failure on the process of cell communication was investigated in cell pairs isolated from the ventricle of cardiomyopathic hamsters (11 months old) and the results compared with age-matched normal hamsters. The gap junctional conductance (gj) was measured with two voltage-clamp amplifiers. The results showed two major populations of cell pairs with respect to gj values: one with very low values (0.8 to 2.5 nS) and the other with higher values (7 to 35 nS). In normal hamsters, the most frequent gj values were in the range of 40 to 100 nS. Angiotensin II (Ang 11, 1 microg/mL) caused cell uncoupling in myopathic myocytes with low gj but reduced gj by 53 +/- 6.6 percent (+/- SE) in cell pairs with higher gj values (7 to 35 nS). The effect of Ang II on gj of myopathic cell pairs was suppressed by losartan (10(-7) mol/L). In cardiomyopathic cell pairs with low gj (0.8 to 2.5 nS), enalapril (1 microg/mL) caused an appreciable increase in gj (219 +/- 20.3 percent), whereas in cell pairs with higher gj (7 to 35 nS), the gj increment was smaller (80 +/- 10.8 percent) but still larger than that seen in controls (33 +/- 5.4 percent). Intracellular dialysis of Ang I (10(-8) mol/L) abolished cell communication in myopathic cell pairs with low gj (0.8 to 2.5 nS) and reduced gj by 66 +/- 1.7 percent in the other pairs (7 to 35 nS). The effect of Ang I on gj was greatly reduced by enalaprilat (10(-9) mol/L) added to the cytosol. Dialysis of Ang II (10(-8) mol/L) into the myopathic cell reduced gj by 48 +/- 4.2 percent, an effect abolished by losartan (10(-8) mol/L). The results indicate that the decline in gj seen in the ventricle of cardiomyopathic hamsters is in part due to activation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "152": "In hypertension with cardiac hypertrophy, the specific contributions to increased production of the cardiac natriuretic peptides (NP) atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) by load and the hypertrophic process are not known. In the present work we determine ANF and BNP synthesis and secretion in the aortic-banded rat treated with dosage schedules of the ACE inhibitor ramipril that result in the prevention or regression of both hypertension and hypertrophy (high dosage) or in the prevention or regression of hypertrophy alone with persistent hypertension (low dosage). Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform switch was studied as an indicator of ventricular cardiocyte hypertrophy as well as the levels of collagen III mRNA as a measure of changes in extracellular matrix.", 
    "153": "Ramipril was administered for 6 weeks just after suprarenal aortic banding, or rats were banded for 6 weeks, after which ramipril was administered during the following 6 weeks. Banding caused an increase in blood pressure, left ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio, plasma and ventricular NP, ventricular NP mRNA, collagen III, and beta-MHC mRNA. Ramipril at 1 mg/kg normalized all these parameters while ramipril at 10 micrograms/kg normalized left ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio but not blood pressure. Plasma and ventricular NP content and mRNA levels were partially normalized by ramipril (10 micrograms/kg). Ramipril (10 micrograms/kg) prevented increased collagen III mRNA levels but did not affect beta-MHC mRNA levels.", 
    "154": "(1) NP production and secretion in aortic-banded rats are independently related to increased blood pressure and hypertrophy. (2) A load-dependent component is more important than a load-independent component in regulating left ventricular NP production. (3) ANF production is more sensitive than BNP production to the load-independent component. (4) Low-dose ramipril treatment reverses hypertrophy and the increased collagen III expression but does not reverse the increased beta-MHC isoform expression, suggesting that these are independently regulated processes. (5) Aortic banding and ACE inhibition do not affect atrial NP production and content.", 
    "155": "Rebound myocardial ischemia develops in patients with unstable or stable angina pectoris after sudden cessation of nitroglycerin therapy. Long-term nitroglycerin infusion is associated with increases in plasma renin activity and catecholamine release rates, both of which may lead to excess angiotensin II and alpha-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction, particularly on withdrawal of nitroglycerin.", 
    "156": "Chronically instrumented dogs were treated for 5 days with nitroglycerin (1.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 i.v.) alone or in combination with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (0.1 mg/kg two times daily or 1 mg/kg). With long-term nitroglycerin therapy, the left anterior circumflex artery was maximally dilated 4 hours after the start of nitroglycerin infusion (9.5 +/- 0.6%) and returned to baseline levels within the third day of treatment (baseline, 2.52 +/- 0.07 mm; day 3, 2.55 +/- 0.07 mm; P = NS), indicating a complete loss of nitroglycerin-induced coronary vasodilatation. Nitroglycerin infusion also was accompanied by a transient increase in plasma renin activity. Sudden withdrawal of nitroglycerin infusion caused a progressive constriction of the left anterior circumflex artery, which peaked 4 hours after nitroglycerin infusion cessation (-7.8 +/- 0.2%). This occurred in the absence of elevated plasma renin activity. Concomitant treatment with high-dose enalapril (1 mg.kg-1.d-1) markedly reduced the degree of tolerance and prevented the rebound constriction on cessation of nitroglycerin therapy.", 
    "157": "Long-term ACE inhibition with high-dose enalapril reduces nitroglycerin tolerance and prevents rebound vasoconstriction in coronary arteries. These phenomena were not associated with an activated circulating renin-angiotensin system. This observation suggests that during long-term nitroglycerin treatment, intrinsic abnormalities of the vascular smooth muscle may have developed that are suppressed by concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. The present study also favors a combination of nitroglycerin and ACE inhibitors to maintain nitrate sensitivity of the vasculature during long-term nitroglycerin treatment.", 
    "158": "Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists, a new class of antihypertensive agents, recently became available for the treatment of clinical hypertension. These agents have a unique mechanism of action: they selectively block the AII receptor type I thereby blocking all known physiological actions of AII that are relevant to hypertension. Controlled clinical trials have shown losartan potassium, the first of the AII receptor type I antagonists approved for clinical use, to be effective, providing long-term control of blood pressure in once daily oral doses in patients who have mild to moderate essential hypertension. Losartan is as efficacious as enalapril maleate and atenolol in these patients. Its antihypertensive effect is enhanced when used in combination with a thiazide diuretic. Losartan is well tolerated and generally free of the side effects that are commonly associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other currently available antihypertensive drugs. Thus, AII receptor blockers represent an important therapeutic advance in treating hypertension and provide a targeted treatment approach to block activation of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "159": "The hypothesis that increased cholesterol synthesis provides a mechanism that contributes to nephrotic syndrome-associated hyperlipidemia is mainly based on experimental evidence. The serum level of the cholesterol precursor, lathosterol (expressed per millimole cholesterol), is a reliable marker of whole-body cholesterol synthesis in normocholesterolemia and primary hypercholesterolemia. Serum lathosterol and lipoprotein levels were measured in 11 moderately hyperlipidemic patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and 22 matched controls. The proteinuric patients were evaluated before and during three antiproteinuric treatment periods with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition therapy (n = 6) or a low-protein diet (n = 5) alone, in combination, and again as a single treatment. In untreated patients, serum total cholesterol, very-low-density (VLDL) and low-density (LDL) lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apo B), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels were higher than in controls (P < .01 to P < .001), but the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio tended to be lower in patients (0.99 +/- 0.43 micromol/mmol) as compared with controls (1.29 +/- 0.41 micromol/mmol, P < .10). During combined antiproteinuric treatment, total and VLDL + LDL cholesterol, apo B, and Lp(a) decreased (P < .02 to P < .01), but remained higher than levels in controls. Yet the serum lathosterol to cholesterol ratio changed little and was even lower (P < .05) in treated patients than in controls. Serum total cholesterol (r = -.82, P < .01) and apo B (r = -.84, P < .01) were inversely correlated with serum albumin in untreated patients, whereas the serum lathosterol to cholesterol ratio was not (r = -.01, NS). In the patient group, multiple regression analysis showed that changes in the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio during the study were only related to changes in the dietary polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio (P:S) coinciding with the low-protein diet (P < .01). In contrast, the decrease of VLDL + LDL cholesterol, apo B, and Lp(a) was independently related to reduction of proteinuria (P < .02 to P < .001), but not to changes in the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio. In conclusion, the present data, based on the serum lathosterol to cholesterol ratio, do not support the concept that increased cholesterol synthesis plays an important role in the maintenance of human nephrotic syndrome-associated hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, it appears unlikely that the decrease of apo B-containing lipoproteins with antiproteinuric treatment is attributable to inhibition of cholesterogenesis. These findings warrant further documentation of cholesterol synthesis in human nephrotic syndrome by direct methods.",

Of 55 diltiazem-treated patients, 21 (38%) were responders (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), 23 (42%) were nonresponders (diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg), and 11 (20%) were withdrawn from the study. Of 61 lisinopril-treated patients, 28 (46%) were responders, 22 (36%) were nonresponders, and 11 (18%) were withdrawn. There was no difference in baseline characteristics or percent responders between the two groups. Systolic pressure decreased from 157 +/- 2.3 to 130 +/- 2.0 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 SEM) in the diltiazem-treated responders and from 153 +/- 2.1 to 127 +/- 2.7 mm Hg in the lisinopril-treated responders (p < 0.0001). Diastolic pressure decreased from 100 +/- 0.9 to 85 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in the diltiazem-treated responders and from 100 +/- 1.0 to 84 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the lisinopril-treated responders (p < 0.0001).

    "166": "Data on all patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated in the ten hospitals in Health region 1 in Norway were extensively analysed over a two month period. Of all the 487 patients 32% received thrombolytic treatment; i.e 36% of those with definite or suspected myocardial infarction on admission. Thrombolytics were withheld, mainly because only 58% of the patients showed ST elevation or bundle branch block on their ECG, and because of a long delay from onset of symptoms to admission to hospital. With increasing age use of thrombolytics decreased, and high age seemed to some degree to act as a contraindication. Relative contraindications such as history of stroke or peptic ulcer contributed modestly to the limited use of thrombolytics. Aspirin was used by 72% of the patients, and either aspirin or anticoagulants in 87%. At six month follow-up 50% used aspirin and 32% warfarin. Betablockers were given to 57% of the patients in hospital, but were not used to any extent in the acute phase of the disease; at six months the proportion of patients on betablockers was about the same. Oral nitrates were used more extensively than betablockers and there is a clear indication that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are used increasingly for secondary prevention.", 
    "167": "Left ventricular remodeling is a dynamic process that occurs in reaction to an insult to the myocardium. The response to either loss of cells, as may occur following myocardial infarction, or to hemodynamic overload, as may occur in aortic stenosis, is an attempt to maintain cardiac output and normalize wall tension. This is accomplished through the activation of the renin-angiotensin system and hypertrophy of noninfarcted segments of the myocardium. in the case of moderate or large infarctions these mechanisms fail to normalize wall stress. The stimulus to further remodeling remains, viable myocytes hypertrophy (with greater increases in cell length than width), the mass-to-volume ratio increases, and an exponential increase in wall stress results. This increase in myocyte tension has been associated with premature myocyte cell death. Thus, a vicious cycle is established wherein overstretch of the myocardium while sustaining cardiac output leads to progressive myocyte loss and left ventricular dilation. The renin-angiotensin system plays an integral role in this process. Its inhibition by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors both chronically and immediately after myocardial infarction has been shown to decrease left ventricular volumes and reduce mortality. Controversy exists regarding the mechanism through which ACE inhibitors exert their effects. ACE inhibitors reduce afterload/preload, circulating angiotensin II levels, and raise circulating levels of bradykinin. It is not yet clear which mechanism is responsible for the greatest impact on left ventricular dilation and mortality. inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is clearly beneficial to cardiac performance as well as morbidity and mortality when myocardium is lost and heart failure ensues. Specific modes of action require further definition, including local and systemic effects. Possible benefits of angiotensin receptor blockade versus augmentation of bradykinin requires definition, setting the stage for further study, while the beneficial therapeutic use of these agents continues.", 
    "168": "Nitrates are effective for the therapy of acute coronary syndromes, including acute myocardial infarction. Their application in acute infarction has established that vasodilators are beneficial provided hypotension is avoided. Nitrates limit early ventricular remodeling in infarction. New dosing strategies and formulations that permit chronic use after infarction with less tolerance might limit late remodeling. Over the last decade, the demonstrated effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in limiting ventricular dilation postinfarction has generated controversy over the usefulness of nitrates for that indication. The uncertainty has been intensified by 2 large mortality trials that tested both agents as adjuncts to conventional therapy. These trials were not designed to test whether nitrates might limit remodeling. Mechanistic experimental and clinical studies that tested whether nitrates or ACE inhibitors could effectively limit ventricular remodeling showed that both improved remodeling endpoints. However, experimental studies raise some concern about the decrease in infarct collagen associated with ACE inhibition and emphasize the fact that final outcome represents a balance of effects. That nitrates do not decrease infarct collagen could be important. Nitrate-induced early recruitment of ventricular function after late reperfusion of acute infarction might also be important. In the mortality trials, >50% of patients received open-label nitrates as per indication. Thus, the trial results to date do not suggest that nitrates are ineffective for remodeling, but rather that ACE inhibitors can confer added benefit. There has been no large clinical trial to test the efficacy of nitrates for remodeling as there has been for ACE inhibitors.", 
    "169": "Congestive heart failure is a frequent disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.4-2% in the general population. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder and new developments in its treatment, the prognosis of heart failure remains poor. All patients with heart failure should undergo diagnostic evaluation to determine the type of cardiac dysfunction, establish its etiology and orient treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin are the standard therapy for chronic congestive heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction. ACE inhibitors are indicated in all stages of heart failure, even in asymptomatic patients. Diuretics should be added in the presence of fluid retention. Digoxin remains an important component in the management of refractory symptoms and atrial fibrillation. Symptomatic improvement and reduced morbidity have been shown with all these drugs. However, improved survival has been documented for ACE inhibitors only. Currently, numerous drugs with different mechanisms of action are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Promising results have been published, mainly with beta-receptor blockers and newer positive inotropic substances. Rapidly growing evidence from basic research will advance our understanding of heart failure and hopefully pave the way for new preventive and therapeutic strategies in the near future.", 
    "170": "From proteolytic digest of swine hemoglobin, we isolated four peptide, E-1 (Phe-Gln-Lys-Val-Val-Ala), E-2 (Phe-Gln-Lys-Val-Val-Ala-Gly), peptide 30-3 (Phe-Gln-Lys-Val-Val-Ala-Lys) and H-1 (Gly-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-Gln). These peptides inhibited angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity with an IC50 of 5.8, 7.4, 2.1 and 1.9 microM, respectively. Oral administration of 50 mg/kg E-1 and 50 mg/kg H-1 decreased blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In normotensive rats, oral administration of 500 mg/kg E-1 and 500 mg/kg H-1 inhibited the pressor effect of i.v. administrated 300 ng/kg angiotensin I, possibly by inhibiting its conversion to angiotensin II. These results suggest that these peptides are orally effective inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme that have a hypotensive effect.", 
    "171": "The cardiovascular profile of the 5-HT1-like receptor agonist sumatriptan has been studied in anaesthetised rabbits pretreated with chlorisondamine (0.5 mg kg-1 i.v.) and enalapril (0.3 mg kg-1 i.v.) to eliminate autonomic reflexes and minimise endogenous vasoconstrictor tone. Under these conditions sumatriptan (2-100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) produced modest increases in carotid vascular resistance but had no significant influence on heart rate, blood pressure or mesenteric vascular resistance. In a similarly pretreated group of animals in which vasoconstrictor tone was elevated by infusion of angiotensin (100 ng kg-1 min-1 i.v.) sumatriptan caused moderate increases in blood pressure (55 +/- 5 to 65 +/- 5 mm Hg after 25 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) and mesenteric vascular resistance (1.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg min ml-1 after 25 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) and tended to produce a greater carotid vasoconstriction (3.6 +/- 0.5 to 4.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg min ml-1 after 25 micrograms kg-1). These effects were antagonised by methiothepin 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v. implying the involvement of 5-HT1-like receptor stimulation. Hence, the presence of angiotensin produces a modest amplification of the vasoconstrictor effects of sumatriptan and, in particular, unmasks a constriction of the mesenteric vascular bed. The degree of synergy observed between these two vasoconstrictors was, however, less marked than might have been expected on the basis of previous isolated tissue studies.", 
    "172": "Hypertension is one of the most common conditions treated by the clinician, yet accurate diagnosis and selection of the appropriate treatment can be challenging and recommendations regarding antihypertensive medications continue to evolve. The fifth report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends diet and exercise for the initial treatment of mild hypertension, followed by a diuretic or beta-blocker if necessary, unless contraindicated. This recommendation is based on outcome studies using these drugs that demonstrate reductions in major diseases that treatment of hypertension is intended to prevent: stroke and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Other antihypertensive drugs, while not tested in large trials evaluating outcomes, have unique advantages for certain patients. Consideration of the patient's medical conditions and needs, including the cost of medication, is essential to ensuring optimal treatment of hypertension.",

Significant differences (P<.01) among groups for average changes during follow-up in each lipid were observed. Decreases in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were greater with doxazosin and acebutolol (for plasma total cholesterol, 0.36 and 0.30 mmol/L [13.8 and 11.7 mg/dL], respectively), less with chlorthalidone and placebo (0.12 and 0.13 mmol/L [4.5 and 5.1 mg/dL], respectively). Decreases in triglycerides were greater with doxazosin and enalapril, least with acebutolol. Increases in HDL cholesterol were greater with enalapril and doxazosin, least with acebutolol. Significant relative increases in plasma total cholesterol with chlorthalidone compared with placebo at 12 months were no longer present at 24 months and beyond, when mean plasma total cholesterol for the chlorthalidone group fell below baseline. Analyses of participants continuing to receive chlorthalidone throughout the 4 years of follow-up indicated this was not due solely to an increasing percentage of participants changing or discontinuing use of medication during follow-up.",

    "182": "A new model of genetic hypertension, the Prague Hypertensive Rat (PHR) was used. In rats just after weaning, 5/6 of renal parenchyma were removed surgically (5/6NX). The rats were observed for 8 weeks after 5/6NX. The animals were fed either a normal rat chow containing 23% of protein, or a low-protein diet containing only 6% protein. Control groups drank tap water, experimental groups received water containing ENA at a dose of 5 mg/kg BW. The rats on normal diet drinking water had the highest levels of blood pressure (200 +/- 4.3 mm Hg), proteinuria (56.2 +/- 14.6 mg/24 hours) and heaviest kidney remnants i.e. highest compensatory hypertrophy (2352 +/- 239.4 mg). Both ENA and low-protein diet significantly improved these functions to the same extent. However, a combination of low-protein diet with ENA had no further beneficial effect as against any of these manoeuvres alone.", 
    "183": "We assume every manoeuvre (low-protein diet and enalapril) exerts a maximal beneficial effect per se: the mechanism of this effect is highly speculative: inhibition of growth factors seems to be the most logical explanation. ACEIs are known to inhibit the production of angiotensin II, low-protein diet should inhibit transforming growth factor beta.", 
    "184": "Human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) exists in intestinal epithelial cells as a membrane-bound (ACEm) and secretory glycoprotein (ACEsec). The electrophoretic mobilities of ACEsec and ACEm on SDS/polyacrylamide gels are similar; the N-deglycosylated ACEsec and ACEm, in contrast, display slight differences in their apparent molecular masses, indicating that the carbohydrate contents of ACEsec and ACEm are different. Moreover, ACEsec is solely N-glycosylated whereas ACEm is N- and O-glycosylated, assessed by lectin binding studies. Spontaneous release of ACEsec is achieved by incubation of brush border membranes at 37 degrees C. Aprotinin, leupeptin and EDTA partly inhibit the generation of ACEsec, strongly suggesting that ACEsec is generated from ACEm by proteolytic cleavage. The expression levels of ACEsec in the intestine may be associated with the differentiation state of mucosal cells. Thus ACEsec is more abundant than ACEm in immature non-epithelial crypt cells of patients with coeliac disease. Well-differentiated epithelial cells, by contrast, contain predominantly ACEm. The variations in the proportions of cleaved ACEsec in differentiated and non-differentiated cells may be due to varying levels of the cleaving protease. Alternatively, because epithelial cell differentiation is accompanied by alterations in the levels of oligosaccharyltransferases, the results suggest a critical role for the glycosylation pattern of ACEm in its susceptibility to the putative cleaving protease.", 
    "185": "Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonselective vasodilators (hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate) has become accepted treatment in patients with symptomatic, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and has been demonstrated in large clinical trials to ameliorate symptoms, improve exercise performance, and reduce cardiac mortality. Nevertheless, the management of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the average 2-year mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than that with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (25%) but, somewhat surprisingly, the nonspecific vasodilators produced significantly more improvement in exercise performance and left ventricular function. Such data suggest that improvement in symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be afforded by the use of a single class of vasodilator therapy, but might be optimized by the combined use of different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of chronic oral extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER) 2.5 to 5 mg twice daily, when added to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III CHF followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity which, in the doses used in this study, exerts its systemic arterial effect by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of additive vasodilator therapy in the management of patients with CHF.", 
    "186": "An 11-year-old castrated male Dachshund was determined to have pancytopenia on the basis of results of CBC and bone marrow cytologic examination. Pancytopenia was believed to have resulted from administration of captopril, which had been administered for treatment of chronic mitral insufficiency, because other causes of pancytopenia were not found. Treatment consisted of discontinuing captopril and stimulating the bone marrow with recombinant human erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Although neutralizing antibodies will develop against the heterologous human protein, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor should be considered for short-term treatment of neutropenias associated with adverse drug reactions, canine parvovirus infections, and bone marrow suppression from primary bone marrow disease, cancer chemotherapy, or total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation.", 
    "187": "A decreased cardiac compliance is a major feature of the cardiomyopathy of diabetes mellitus. Either an increase in the resistance afterload to the LV or an increase in collagen cross-linking induced by the formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) of collagen may be responsible for the stiff myocardium. To evaluate these hypotheses, we examined the effect of captopril, an afterload-reducing agent, and aminoguanidine, a nucleophilic hydrazine that prevents the accumulation of collagen AGEs, on left ventricular end-diastolic (LVED) compliance after 4 months of streptozotocin (0.26 mmol/kg)-induced diabetes mellitus in rats.", 
    "188": "Diabetes mellitus produced a decrease in LV chamber compliance as a result of an increased myocardial stiffness (slope of the linearized LVED stress-LVED strain relation [unitless]: diabetes mellitus, 47+/-4; control, 27+/-3; P<.001) and an increase in blood pressure as a result of an elevated vascular resistance. LV end-systolic elastance was unaltered by diabetes mellitus. The stiff myocardium was not associated with changes in the myocardial collagen volume fraction or total hydroxyproline concentration but was associated with an increased myocardial collagen fluorescence (fluorescence units/microg hydroxyproline) (diabetes mellitus, 11+/-1.1; control, 6.6+/-0.7; P<.01). Captopril therapy (0.22 mmol x kg(-1) x d(-1)), despite producing a decrease in blood pressure through alterations in vascular resistance, failed to decrease myocardial stiffness in rats with diabetes mellitus. Alternatively, administration of aminoguanidine (7.35 mmol x kg(-1) x d(-1)) prevented both the enhanced myocardial collagen fluorescence (7.1+/-1.2) and the increased slope of the linearized LVED stress-LVED strain relation (29+/-2) but did not change markers of blood glucose control.", 
    "189": "These results demonstrate that diabetes mellitus can produce a stiff myocardium before the development of myocardial fibrosis. The stiff myocardium in the early stages of the development of the cardiomyopathy of diabetes mellitus is not a consequence of an increase in ventricular resistance afterload and in these circumstances is associated with the formation of collagen AGEs.",

After adjustment for different durations of treatment (mean duration of treatment, 25 weeks), left ventricular mass decreased 13% with ACE inhibitors, 9% with calcium channel blockers, 6% with beta-blockers, and 7% with diuretics. There was a significant difference between drug classes (P<.01): ACE inhibitors reduced left ventricular mass more than beta-blockers (significant, P<.05) and diuretics (tendency, P=.08). Similar differences between drug classes were found with regard to effect on left ventricular wall thickness (P<.05).",

The ACE inhibitors seemed to be more potent than beta-blockers and diuretics in the reduction of left ventricular mass index; calcium channel blockers were somewhat in the intermediate range. The ACE inhibitors and, to a lesser extent, calcium channel blockers emerged as first-line candidates to reduce the risk associated with left ventricular hypertrophy.",

Medicaid administrative files were used to identify filled prescriptions for ACEIs and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and to identify first episodes of angioedema that occurred during exposure to an ACEI or CCB. There were 48,776 black and 106,482 white patients with 43,989 and 114,448 person-years of exposure to an ACEI, respectively. For comparison, there were 49,004 black and 110,129 white patients with 43,064 and 117,684 person-years of exposure to a CCB, respectively. The incidence of angioedema in blacks ranged from 3.3 to 4.6 per 1000 person-years of ACEI exposure--three to four times higher than that for whites in each state. Controlling for a slightly greater incidence of angioedema in blacks and other covariates, black users of ACEIs had a 3.1-fold greater incidence than white users. First exposure to ACEIs was associated with a higher risk of angioedema than chronic exposure in blacks, but not whites. Among blacks, the rate of angioedema during the first 30 days of exposure was 11.4 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5 to 37.0) among ACEI users than CCB users; for those with at least 1 year of exposure, the rate was 4.5 times higher (95% CI, 2.6 to 8.0). Among whites, the increased risk of angioedema was more modest (rate ratio 1.7, 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.4 compared to CCB users) and did not differ by duration of ACEI use. In an analysis of angioedema cases and randomly selected controls in a subset of the full cohort, the greater risk of ACEI-associated angioedema in blacks was not explained by concurrent exposure to diuretics or antibiotics. Blacks may be at greater risk of angioedema when taking ACEIs than whites. Further study is necessary to confirm these findings, to examine effects of underlying disease on angioedema incidence, and to describe any racial differences in the severity of angioedema occurring with ACEIs.",

The effect was studied on right ventricular dimensions and renal profile after a period of 6 weeks treatment. The control patients showed a significant decrease of RVIDED and increase in GFR, but the decrease of RVAWT and increase of 'a' wave amplitude was insignificant. However when the ACE-inhibitor enalapril was added to the treatment, there was a significant decrease of RVIDED, RVAWT and an increase of 'a' wave amplitude with a significant improvement in the GFR. A comparison between both the groups showed that the increase of GFR and decrease of RVIDED was higher in enalapril group than controls. The increase of 'a' wave amplitude was also greater in enalapril group. Thus enalapril appears to be of value in chronic cor-pulmonale, where it decreases pulmonary hypertension and thus right ventricular after load. It also decreases renal vascular resistance increasing the renal blood flow, thus improving the GFR.",

The solubilized 775 g sediment was applied to an immobilized captopril column, eluted successively with 20 mM Pi(K+), pH 7.8 buffer, buffer/0.5 M NaCl, and buffer/0.01M cysteine to obtain four major protein bands, two of which appeared with the cysteine eluant. The first two protein peaks were each pooled and subjected to ultrafiltration with 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filters. The pooled peaks, retentates and ultrafiltrates each inhibited the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, suggesting the presence of large and small molecular weight reversible angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in association with the solubilized (membranous) particulate angiotensin-converting enzyme fraction. These results expand upon earlier observations on the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in mammalian serum by observing an increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme activity with increasing dilution. This activity was eluted in multiple peaks, including elution with the cysteine eluate, suggesting that the angiotensin-converting enzyme, as well as other proteins, may react covalently with the sulfhydryl functional group of the immobilized captopril in a transsulfhydration reaction cleaving the disulfide bonds in proteins. Subsequent elution with cysteine affects an additional transsulfhydration reaction, releasing the proteins from the column. It is further postulated that air oxidation of the proteins permits reformation of disulfide bonds, yielding some active angiotensin-converting enzyme. Having in mind the possibility of lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors crossing the blood-brain barrier as a means of treatment of alcohol abuse, the intriguing presence of a naturally occurring angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the particulate, lipid-rich fraction of the lung cell raises the theory that inhibitors such as these might cross the blood-brain barrier to serve as downregulators of alcohol consumption.",

Epidemiologic data are extrapolations from either studies performed in other countries or estimates from hospital and outpatient clinics utilisation, and economic data are taken from Spanish studies. The time horizon of the study was set at four years, and results are referred to year 1993.

It generates net savings for the health system estimated in 1,500 to 3,000 million pesetas, also in four years. Using enalapril as part of the standard therapy for chronic heart failure generates an increase both in saved years of life and quality of life, and is associated with net savings for the health system.",

    "224": "Complementary to its essential role in the central nervous control of cardiovascular activity, the neuropeptide angiotensin II may regulate attentional processes. The present study evaluated central nervous, cardiovascular, and sympathetic indicators of attention after inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis by captopril (50 mg vs. placebo) in 14 men. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and stimulus-related electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were recorded while the subject performed an auditory oddball task. Captopril increased both the N1-P2 component of the ERP (p < .05) and--following the first tone of the task--the EEG desynchronization in the lower alpha frequency band (p < .05). Although blood pressure remained unchanged, heart rate was lowered (p < .05) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased (p < .01) after captopril. The effects suggest that inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis enhances an attentional state typically present during sensory intake.", 
    "225": "The prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) is high among the elderly population. Many of the physiological and morphological changes attributable to 'normal' aging predispose older adults to cardiovascular instability. The incidence of both MIs and their associated morbidity and mortality increase with aging. Older MI patients may therefore derive substantial benefit from appropriately selected therapeutic intervention. In fact, given the high morbidity and mortality associated with MI in the elderly, aggressive therapeutic strategies may be particularly warranted. There are a number of age-related cardiovascular changes that contribute to the increasing incidence of MI as adults age. However, age itself is not a contraindication to aggressive therapy. Common MI management options include invasive and pharmaceutical strategies. The relative advantages of angioplasty and thrombolytics must be considered. Other drugs used in the treatment of MI include beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, aspirin, anticoagulants, magnesium, antiarrhythmics and calcium antagonists. Significant peri-infarction complications, including heart failure, hypotension, arrhythmias, myocardial rupture and cardiogenic shock, often occur in older adults. Age-specific management strategies for these complications are reviewed.", 
    "226": "A role for the renal renin-angiotensin system in the direct stimulation of salt appetite in the rat remains controversial because attempts to elicit the behavior by intravenous administration of angiotensin II (ANG II) have been unconvincing. We recently demonstrated that depletion-induced salt appetite was attenuated by selective blockade of peripheral ANG II synthesis with an intravenous dose of converting enzyme inhibitor [captopril (Cap)] that does not block the synthesis of ANG II inside the blood brain barrier. We now show that intravenous ANG II at 30 ng/min rapidly reestablishes salt appetite in Cap-blocked rats. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of unblocked, sodium-depleted rats was normal, but Cap-blocked, depleted rats had low MAP. An intravenous infusion of ANG II in Cap-blocked rats brought MAP into the normal range and elicited water and salt drinking within 90 min. Phenylephrine also normalized MAP but failed to elicit fluid intake in Cap-blocked, sodium-deficient rats. Sodium and water balances tended to be more positive during ANG II than during phenylephrine infusions. Thus circulating ANG II may stimulate both thirst and salt appetite by a direct action on the brain and not by causing natriuresis or by raising the blood pressure.", 
    "227": "Losartan potassium is an orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist. It is the first of a new class of drugs to be introduced for clinical use in hypertension. This novel agent binds competitively and selectively to the AII subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor, thereby blocking AII-induced physiological effects. An active metabolite, E3174, contributes substantially to its antihypertensive effect, which persists throughout 24 hours after once-daily administration. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, losartan potassium 50 to 100mg once daily as monotherapy lowers blood pressure to a similar degree to enalapril, atenolol and felodipine extended release (ER). Losartan potassium combined with hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure further than either drug given separately. About one-third of patients with severe hypertension have responded to the combination product. Losartan potassium appears to be effective in elderly patients. Losartan potassium is very well tolerated. In clinical trials, dizziness was the only drug-related event reported more frequently with losartan potassium monotherapy than with placebo. First-dose hypotension is uncommon. An aspect of the drug's tolerability profile which may prove to be particularly advantageous is that it is associated with a similar incidence of cough to placebo in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-related cough. Additionally, clinically relevant adverse metabolic effects or laboratory abnormalities have not been documented during losartan potassium therapy and renal function is preserved in patients with or without renal insufficiency. The adverse effect profile of the losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide combination resembles those for losartan potassium monotherapy and placebo. Long term tolerability data are limited (<2 years) but support the very good tolerability profile in shorter studies. Elements of the drug's profile yet to be assessed or reported fully in the literature include long term efficacy; potential to favourably influence cardiovascular and renovascular systems (and ultimately mortality) in patients with hypertension and, lastly, cost effectiveness and influence on quality of life. In summary, losartan potassium is the first AT(1)+ receptor antagonist to become available for the management of hypertension and, as such, it is an important new antihypertensive agent. Pending long term data as outlined above, it is likely to find initial use in patients with mild to severe hypertension who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of their current therapy. However, with its novel mechanism of action, good efficacy and favourable tolerability profile, losartan potassium is well placed to claim a prominent position in the management of patients with essential hypertension in the future.", 
    "228": "Fosinopril is a phosphinic acid derivative which undergoes rapid hydrolysis after oral administration to the active diacid ACE inhibitor fosinoprilat. Cardiotropic effects have been associated with the drug, and the compensatory dual elimination route of fosinopril via renal and hepatic systems offers an opportunity for ACE inhibitor treatment of hypertension in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Comparative trials of monotherapy with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day have demonstrated antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to that of sustained release nifedipine 40 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg/day, enalapril 5 to 10 mg/day amlodipine 5 to 10 mg/day and sustained release verapamil 240 to 480 mg/day, and superior to that of isradipine 5 mg/day. The efficacy of combination therapy with fosinopril 10 to 20 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day was significantly superior to that of hydrochlorothiazide alone, tended to be superior to that of fosinopril 20 mg/day alone and was similar to that of sustained release nifedipine 40 mg/day alone. The combination of fosinopril/chlorthalidone 20 to 40/25 mg/day was as effective as propranolol/chlorthalidone 80 to 160/25 mg/day. The incidence of adverse effects associated with fosinopril is low, and cough may possibly occur less often with this drug than with other ACE inhibitors. Fosinopril thus offers an effective and well tolerated option for the treatment of hypertension in adult and elderly patients, including those with renal or hepatic impairment.", 
    "229": "Whether the arterial elastic structures are involved in the beneficial effects of long-term treatment with organic nitrates on atherosclerosis-induced changes in hemodynamics and arterial wall viscoelastic properties, are case for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, is not known. In the present study, atherogenic (A) diet, and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) (I) (60 mg Risordan LP, daily dose) were given concomitantly for 4 months to adult Pitman-Moore minipigs (A + I animals, n = 8), which were compared with A (n = 8) or control (C, n = 8) animals. Blood flow was investigated by hemodynamics in the hindlimb arterial bed; and wall rheology, histomorphometry and elastin; and desmosine (DES) and isodesmosine (IDE) contents in the abdominal aorta. Atherosclerosis prominently impaired the function of capacitance and resistance arteries, altered blood pressure contours, increased aortic stiffness and wall tension, and reduced parietal viscoelasticity through viscous component blunting. The treatment with ISDN significantly improved aortic pulsatility, arteriolar opposition to blood flow, and blood pressure (BP) contours by restoring, at least in part, the wall viscoelastic properties. However, there was no significant change in the area of the pressure-diameter curve hysteresis between the three animal groups. In contrast, ISDN reduced neither the cross-sectional area of lesions nor the losses in wall elastin content and had no influence on lipid accumulations in vessels and in the blood. The present results demonstrate that the beneficial hemodynamic and wall viscoelastic effects elicited by ISDN in atherosclerotic minipigs are not accounted for by therapeutic properties of the nitric oxide (NO) donor against alterations of elastic structures, but by the viscoelastic properties in the arterial wall.", 
    "230": "We wished to determine whether pretreatment with captopril, an angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, modified the myocardial and haemodynamic consequences of chronic administration of norepinephrine (NE) in rats. Administration of NE (0.15 mg kg(-1) h(-1) by an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously for 28 days) resulted in left but not right ventricular hypertrophy. Captopril (250 but not 52 mu g kg(-1) h(1) administered for 28 days) significantly attenuated the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (weight of left ventricle to body weight ratio was 0.46 +/- 0.01 0.57 +/- 0.02, 0.53 +/- 0.02, and 0.51 +/- 0.01 for vehicle, NE, and NE plus low and high dose of captopril, respectively). Chronic administration of NE caused significant increases in systolic arterial blood pressure (BP: 194 +/- 11 vs. 130 +/- 6 mm Hg), systolic left ventricular pressure, heart rate (HR: 458 +/- 13 vs. 389 +/- 15 beats/min) and dP dt(-1)(max) P(-1), an index of myocardial contractility (202 +/- 29 vs. 91 +/- 3 s(-1)). Captopril (250 mu g kg(-1) h(-1) for 28 days) significantly reduced diastolic arterial BP (from 86 +/- 6 to 53 +/- 3 mm Hg). Concomitant administration of this dose of captopril together with NE prevented the NE-induced increase in systolic arterial BP but did not modify the increases in HR or dP dt(-1) max P(-1) (261 +/- 41 and 202 +/- 29 s(-1) in captopril and NE vs. NE-alone groups). Acute administration of NE (0.1-10 mu g kg(-1) intravenously, i.v.) produced less marked increases in cardiac contractility and in arterial BP in rats chronically pretreated with NE or NE plus captopril than in animals receiving vehicle or captopril alone. Chronic administration of NE and/or captopril did not significantly modify the haemodynamic effects of the acute administration of calcium chloride. We conclude that administration of captopril at 250 but not 52 mu g kg(-1) h(-1) for 28 days attenuates NE-induced cardiac hypertrophy and that this effect is associated with a decrease in systolic arterial BP. Captopril did not modify the reduced effects of acutely administered NE in rats treated with NE for a prolonged period.", 
    "231": "We previously demonstrated differing blood pressure (BP) responses to the first dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in congestive heart failure (CHF). We wished to confirm the disparate responses to the first dose of these agents, study the response to repeated dosing, and explore possible explanations (slow, tight binding, and steric hindrance) for the phenomenon. Forty-eight elderly patients (aged 51-85 years) with stable CHF were studied for 48 hours. Groups (n = 12) received one of the following: (a) perindopril 2 mg orally (p.o.) + placebo intravenously (i.v.) (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg p.o. (day 2); (b) enalapril 2.5 mg p.o. + placebo i.v. (day 1) and enalapril 2.5 mg p.o. (day 2); (c) placebo p.o. + perindopril at 0.167 mg i.v. (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg p.o. (day 2); or (d) placebo p.o. + placebo i.v. (day 1) and placebo p.o. (day 2). Supine BP was measured on day 1. On day 2, BP was recorded by ambulatory BP monitor. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at intervals during the 48-h study period for estimation of neurohumoral parameters. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was estimated by plasma ACE inhibition and also by the ratio of angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang I + Ang II. On day I, enalapril 2.5 mg caused a greater decrease in BP than did placebo response between 6 and 9 h postdose. Perindopril 2 mg produced a profile of BP response similar to that of placebo. Ambulatory BP on day 2 was consistently lower with enalapril as compared with perindopril. Profiles of plasma ACE inhibition were similar with each active therapy. Enalapril therapy produced a greater increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) than did other treatments. There was no temporal dissociation between plasma ACE inhibition and profile of Ang peptides for any treatment. We have confirmed the disparate BP responses to perindopril and enalapril in CHF. We noted no evidence of slow, tight binding or steric hindrance to explain these differences.", 
    "232": "Nanterinone (UK-61,260) is a novel positive inotropic and balanced-type vasodilating drug, only partially based on phosphodiesterase III inhibition. Preliminary data from controlled studies suggest satisfactory long-term efficacy and safety. As its acute hemodynamic effects in humans are unknown, an oral dose of 2 mg nanterinone was studied in 14 patients with heart failure (NYHA class II-III) on chronic diuretic and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment. Before the study, patients were on a 2 g salt-balanced diet, and they received their last medication 16 hours before each study day. Hemodynamic measurements were carried out before and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration of the study drug. All patients received placebo and nanterinone on 2 consecutive days. Following nanterinone, systemic vascular resistance decreased immediately from 1699 +/- 82 (mean +/- SEM) at baseline to 1368 +/- 80 at 1 hour. Changes persisted for 12 hours. Concomitantly, there was an immediate and significant fall in pulmonary wedge pressure to 38% of baseline at 1.5 hours, together with a 20% reduction in pulmonary artery pressure. Heart rate remained unchanged and arterial pressures showed only a short, significant decrease. Cardiac index rose significantly from 2.28 +/- 0.15 at baseline to a highest value of 2.65 +/- 0.14 1/min/m2 at 1 hour. Changes persisted for 3 hours. Placebo had no effect on these variables. As, in view of its potential venodilating properties, hemodynamic improvement by nanterinone may depend on pre-existing left ventricular filling pressure, patients were subsequently grouped according to baseline pulmonary wedge pressure of > 12 mmHg (H-PCWP) and < or = 12 mmHg (L-PCWP). Cardiac index improved by 26% in H-PCWP and by 17% in L-PCWP (NS). In contrast, PCWP fell more markedly in H-PWCP than in L-PCWP (40% and 23%, respectively, p < 0.05). Thus, oral nanterinone results in a significant acute hemodynamic improvement and is well tolerated. Although changes in left ventricular filling pressure are more pronounced in patients with elevated pre-existing PCWP, cardiac pump function improves equally in patients with normal or low left ventricular filling pressure at baseline.", 
    "233": "Cilazapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and mibefradil, a selective T-type voltage-operated calcium channel blocker, have been shown to prevent neointima formation after vascular injury. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the mechanism of action of both drugs. For this purpose, the influence of the renin angiotensin system on the effects of mibefradil (30 mg/kg po) and cilazapril (10 mg/kg po) on neointima formation after carotid injury were evaluated in normotensive rats (normal renin angiotensin system) and DOCA hypertensive rats (suppressed renin angiotensin system). In addition, in order to differentiate an effect on cell migration or cell proliferation, both drugs were given either before or after the smooth muscle migration phase. Finally, cilazapril and mibefradil were given in combination. In normotensive rats, mibefradil and cilazapril decreased neointima formation, resulting in neointima/media ratios of 38% (p < 0.05) and 53% (p < 0.01), respectively. However, in DOCA hypertensive rats, mibefradil was active, with a reduction of the neointima/media ratio by 63% (p < 0.001), whereas cilazapril reduced it only slightly (19%) and not significantly. In addition, cilazapril was active only when treatment started before the migration phase (63%, reduction in neointima/media ratio, p < 0.001) but not when started thereafter (13% reduction in neointima/media ratio, n.s.). In contrast, treatment with mibefradil was also active when started after the migration phase (51% reduction in neointima/ media ratio, p < 0.001 when treatment started 1 day before balloon injury and 41%, p < 0.01 when treatment started 5 days after balloon injury). The combination of both drugs was additive (67% reduction in neointima/media ratio, p < 0.001 vs. control). These experiments clearly show that mibefradil and cilazapril have a different mechanism of action after vascular injury. Mibefradil most likely prevents the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. In contrast, cilazapril most likely inhibits the migration of smooth muscle cells. These two different mechanisms of action explain why the effects of both drugs are additive.", 
    "234": "A significant subset of patients with chronic heart failure have preserved systolic function and their symptoms are attributable to left ventricular diastolic abnormalities. In the setting of diastolic heart failure, the cardiac chambers are nondilated and have normal contractility, but left ventricular filling is impaired. This impairment in diastolic filling is related to both abnormalities of the passive elastic properties of the ventricle and impaired active relaxation as a result of any of the following: myocardial ischemia, hypertrophy, reduced beta-adrenergic tone, or increases in myocardial connective tissue. Therapy of diastolic heart failure is aimed at preventing and reducing left ventricular hypertrophy, treating elevated blood pressure, and reducing left ventricular filling pressure without reducing cardiac output. This may be achieved by maintaining sinus rhythm, slowing heart rate, and treating ischemia. Although calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and nitrates may improve symptoms in patients with diastolic heart failure, there are few data to indicate that these agents have an important effect on prognosis. Further studies of patients with diastolic heart failure are needed to assess its prevalence, clinical characteristics, prognosis, and response to therapy.", 
    "235": "Despite therapy with diuretics, digoxin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, congestive heart failure remains an important health problem with high mortality, and it is clear that new treatments for heart failure are needed. Evidence from basic research, animal studies, and clinical human trials indicates that high adrenergic tone in patients with heart failure is deleterious; furthermore, the deleterious effects are partially reversible with beta-adrenergic blockade. This article reviews the recent developments in our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure and the recent data concerning the treatment of heart failure with beta-blocking agents.", 
    "236": "It is sobering to recall that, despite much basic research and many small and large clinical trials, we still do not know how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors work. This is true both in terms of their fundamental mode of action at a cellular level as well as in the patient in the clinical setting. New pharmaceutical compounds such as renin inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and aldosterone antagonists are bringing new insights not only into the importance of different components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure but also into the mode of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This manuscript also provides a brief update on the organization of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and other angiotensin-II-forming pathways with special relevance to heart failure. Data on the potential relevance of genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are discussed. Possibly the single most important observation in clinical cardiovascular medicine in 1995 was the reporting of a highly significant interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin on mortality in patients with ventricular dysfunction with or without heart failure. This has called into question the safety of aspirin use in heart failure.", 
    "237": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of salt-restriction alone and in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (cilazapril) on both office and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) levels in free living subjects with elevated BP. The study was carried out in an out-patient setting with subjects recruited from occupational health care system mainly. After exclusions, 39 subjects (24 men, 15 women, aged 28-65 years) with mildly to moderately elevated BP completed the study. After 3 months run-in period with placebo (first month on normal-salt and the next 2 months on sodium-restricted diet) the subjects were randomised into either salt-restriction placebo or salt-restriction cilazapril (2.5 mg daily) groups for 3 months. In the whole group, 24-h urinary sodium excretion decreased (mean +/- s.d.) from 198 +/- 60 to 112 +/- 59 mmol (4 weeks vs 24 weeks, P < 0.001). Systolic and diastolic office BP decreased during the placebo-sodium-restriction phase (-7.1 [95% Cl -11.2; -3.0] and -4.2 [95% Cl -6.6; -1.8] mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP), and similarly the daytime ambulatory BP (ABP) was reduced during this period (-2.8 [95% Cl -5.2; -0.5] and -2.8 [95% Cl -4.5; -1.2] mm Hg, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) respectively). No changes were observed in the night time ABP. Addition of cilazapril to sodium-restriction enhanced significantly the office BP (-13.2, [95% Cl -20.2; -6.2], and -9.1 [95% Cl -13.5; -4.7]) and daytime ABP (-5.9, [95% Cl -10.1; -1.8] and -5.3, [95% Cl -8.8; -1.9]) reduction. Blood glucose, plasma insulin or serum lipids did not change during the study. Moderate sodium restriction seems to lower the office and daytime ABP levels in subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of cilazapril could be enhanced by sodium restriction.", 
    "238": "A solid-phase immunoassay with detection based on time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FIA) has been developed for the determination of lisinopril and enalaprilat in human serum. The immunogen was prepared by coupling lisinopril to bovine serum albumin through a two-step reaction with difluorodinitrobenzene. An antiserum specific to both lisinopril and enalaprilat was used. The assay is based on the competitive immunoassay principle in which the drug competes with biotin-labeled drug for a limited quantity of primary antibody bound via sheep anti-rabbit globulin to the wells of microtitration strips. At the end of the first incubation, the unbound biotin-labeled drug is washed away. In the second step, europium-labeled streptavidin (specific to biotin) reacts with the biotin already bound to the solid-phase antibody. After a washing step, the addition of an enhancement solution dissociates the europium ions from the labeled streptavidin into solution. The fluorescence from each sample is inversely proportional to the concentration of the drug in the sample. The assay demonstrates good accuracy, reproducibility and specificity at serum concentrations down to 0.5 ng ml-1. However, the useful concentration range of TR-FIA is much narrower than that obtained by double antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA).", 
    "239": "Table 1 shows how the five major drug groups interact with those variables which should be especially considered when treating the hypertensive diabetic. While diuretics are sometimes required in severely hypertensive cases-particularly when fluid retention is part of the clinical picture, and beta blockers are the outstanding choice for those with active CHD- the newer agents, particularly ACE inhibitors and alpha blockers, appear, in theory, to be better agents in terms of preventing the major adverse cardiovascular events to which diabetics are so prone. These two types of agents are very effective together and the addition of a calcium antagonist is likely to control the blood pressures of the vast majority of patients. However, one or more randomized controlled trials to evaluate whether recommendations such as these are valid is desperately needed. Meanwhile, each physician is left to make his or her own best estimate as to which drug to use and at what threshold.", 
    "240": "A total of 3463 hypertensive patients with type II diabetes were treated with lisinopril for 3 months. Lisinopril was well tolerated, adverse effects were observed in only 2.2% of the patients. Blood pressure values were effectively reduced by lisinopril, two-thirds of the patients could be treated with lisinopril monotherapy. Parameters of metabolic control (HbA1c, lipids) showed an overall improvement under lisinopril therapy. Serum levels of creatinine did not change in patients who were with normal pretreatment values, but were normalized in approximately 50% of patients with elevated pretreatment values. It can be concluded that under routine medical care ACE inhibitor lisinopril is a well tolerated, effective drug for treatment of hypertensive type II diabetic patients.", 
    "241": "The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) has been the subject of several studies conducted during recent years. These studies have demonstrated the capacity of these agents to improve both survival and morbidity of patients with MI. However, the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI has been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) and so could jeopardise the ischaemic myocardium. A significant reduction in systemic BP has been demonstrated by all the studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI, but no relationship has been found between the occurrence of hypotension and a worse clinical outcome. An increased risk of death has been observed exclusively in association with severe and sudden hypotension, the occurrence of which can be largely prevented by the administration of the ACE inhibitor according to an increasing dose-titration scheme. Conversely, a certain degree of long term BP reduction could result in some beneficial effect in patients with MI and contribute to the lower incidence of re-infarction observed in patients with acute MI undergoing long term treatment with captopril. Since the renin-angiotensin system is strictly related to kidney function, its blockade by an ACE inhibitor could result in some degree of renal dysfunction, particularly in patients with MI and impaired ventricular function. The available results from large-scale studies suggest that abnormalities in kidney function (namely an increase in serum creatinine) are observed in 0.9 to 2.4% of patients with MI who, nevertheless, experience some benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors. Interestingly, the administration of ACE inhibitors does not seem to further compromise severely impaired renal function, and may also represent a useful tool for the treatment of patients with renal dysfunction associated with MI. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients with MI is associated with a satisfactory clinical and laboratory safety profile. The occurrence of significant adverse effects seems to be very low and mainly attributable to a rather modest prevalence of cough (2.4 to 6.8%). Discontinuation of treatment because of biochemical and haematological abnormalities has been observed in less than 1% of treated patients. Thus, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor treatment seem to outweigh safety concerns, thereby reinforcing the role of ACE inhibition as a suitable therapeutic strategy in the treatment of patients with MI.", 
    "242": "Captopril renography (CRS) with 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-MAG3 was performed on a 21-year-old woman with renovascular hypertension due to right renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia. In the affected kidney, the renogram pattern was substantially changed with 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-MAG3 following the administration of captopril, and the quantitated renal uptake indicating individual renal function was significantly decreased in 99mTc-DTPA and slightly decreased in 99mTc-MAG3. In the contralateral normal kidney, the renogram showed some minor changes with both radioagents, while the quantitated renal uptake was significantly decreased with 99mTc-DTPA and substantially increased with 99mTc-MAG3. The combined use of physiologically different renal agents 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-MAG3 is helpful in investigating hemodynamic and functional changes in the stenosed kidney as well as the normal kidney in RVH.",

Markedly impaired right renal function (Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values for the right kidney = 14 ml/min, left kidney = 79 ml/min) was detected in the initial captopril study. Only lower pole activity of the right kidney was observed during the whole study. Since prior ultrasonographic examinations have shown bilateral normal kidney parenchyma, branch stenosis of the right upper pole was suspected. Besides significant function improvement in the following baseline study (GFR values for the right kidney = 59 ml/min, left kidney = 79 ml/min), the right kidney, this time normally shaped, was visibly higher positioned. Because of the possibility of mobile kidney and/or branch stenosis, the patient underwent selective renal angiography. A long pediculed right kidney without renal artery stenosis was found. The final diagnosis was essential hypertension. Kidney position anomalies could influence the reliability of the captopril scintigraphy, particularly when a theoretical kidney depth formula is employed for the attenuation correction.",

At a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, ME3221 suppressed the mortality and the hypertensive complications observed in control SHRSP: cerebral apoplexy (hemorrhage, and spongeform and malacia in the cerebral cortex), increased proteinuria, and total N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity, and cardiac hypertrophy and pleural effusion. The protective activity of ME3221, a surmountable angiotensin AT1-receptor antagonist, was comparable to losartan, an insurmountable AT1-antagonist, and also to enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

The disorder can manifest itself as a purely functional phenomenon with tubular elimination of amino acids, enzymes, protein, glucose and electrolytes, or it is due to reversible hemodynamic changes; on the other hand, it may be accompanied by cell necrosis and inflammation. Hemodynamic, toxic, immunologic, or mechanically obstructive mechanisms or a combination of these play a pathogenetic role.

The diabetic nephropathy is one of the best treatable renal disease due to the treatment strategies derived from this knowledge and the new emerging therapeutic perspectives. However, it is a prerequisite that the treatment is started early in the course of the disease. The onset of microalbuminuria is currently the known indication for the development of a nephropathy in a patient with diabetes. Additional to the intensified insulin treatment, the application of an ACE-inhibitor should be taken into account when microalbuminuria occurs.",

At the cellular level, the re-expression of ANF represents a well-established marker of myocyte hypertrophy while the decreased expression of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase is thought o play a crucial role in the alterations of Ca2+ handling and LV function. We assessed the dose-dependent effect of chronic ACE inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade on cardiac function in relation to the cardiac expression of the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase and ANF.",

LV dimensions, hypertrophy and wall stress were determined in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging and the gene expressions of ANF and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase were quantified by Northern blot. Low doses of both drugs did not affect blood pressure, hypertrophy, systolic wall stress and the ANF and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase gene expression. High doses of each drug reduced systolic blood pressure, wall stress, and LV hypertrophy to a similar extent and to values comparable to normotensive, age-matched rats. In addition, high dose treatment reduced LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume as compared to untreated 2K-1C animals and normalized the mRNA levels of both ANF and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (as compared to normotensive animals).", 
    "250": "We conclude that in this model, high doses of ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade are necessary to normalize systolic blood pressure, LV hypertrophy and systolic LV wall stress which, in turn, is associated with restoration of a normal cardiac phenotype with respect to SR Ca(2+)-ATPase and ANF and normalization of cardiac function.",

At 12 weeks left ventricular function and inner diameters were analyzed by echocardiography of anesthetized animals, and responsiveness to forskolin (systolic developed pressure) was determined in isolated perfused hearts. Functional activities of AC and the stimulatory G protein Gs were measured as well as mRNA expression (quantitative slot blot analyses) of AC type V, isoforms of Gs alpha and Gi alpha 2. G protein alpha-subunits were also quantified by immunoblotting.

In-vivo left ventricular function and diameters were unchanged in LVH. In contrast, in hearts with LVH, responsiveness of left ventricles to forskolin was attenuated and basal, GTP gamma S and forskolin as well as manganese chloride-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly downregulated by approximately 40% (basal 20.8 +/- 1.9 pmol cAMP/mg per min vs. 34.0 +/- 2.2 in sham; P < 0.01). However, no significant changes of AC type V mRNA were found in hypertrophied left ventricles. Functional activity of the stimulatory G protein Gs was reduced in LVH (48 +/- 7 pmol cAMP/mg per min in Veh vs. 68 +/- 3 in sham), whereas mRNA expression of long and short Gs alpha-isoforms was not altered and that of Gi alpha 2 was only slightly increased in ramipril-treated animals.

The impact of ACE inhibitors has been such that for a new treatment modality to be of real value in CHF, it will need to offer haemodynamic benefit over and above that already obtained with an ACE inhibitor; anti-endothelin drugs seem to have this potential [57,98]. Ongoing studies with agents which inhibit either the generation or actions of endothelin-1 will clarify its role in the pathophysiology of CHF and determine whether anti-endothelin drugs represent a further therapeutic advance in the treatment of this disease.",

    "266": "Hypertension and diabetes co-exist more commonly than would be expected from their individual prevalences. Elevated blood pressure is most commonly due to coexisting essential hypertension, or diabetic renal disease. Early stages of diabetic renal disease can be identified by detecting microalbuminuria. Standard measures of blood pressure are not necessarily raised, but 24-hour ambulatory measures frequently identify a loss of nocturnal drop in blood pressure. Treating hypertension aggressively is important in slowing the inexorable decline in glomerular filtration rate. In diabetes there appears to be no 'J'-shaped relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular events, thus removing any concern about attaining low blood pressures as long as the patient is asymptomatic. Morbidity and mortality in these patients is usually associated with cardiovascular events, and it is important to assess the effect of drugs on left ventricular hypertrophy and metabolic parameters. Many drugs are effective at lowering blood pressure, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have an additional renoprotective action. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists may improve lipid profiles and calcium antagonists are probably lipid neutral, making these drugs useful alternatives. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (eg, nifedipine) may augment protein-uria, and hence non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) would be preferred. beta-Blockers and thiazide diuretics have the disadvantage of causing a deterioration in glycaemic and lipid profiles, but can be useful on occasions.",

We report a combined analysis of 235 normotensive IDDM patients with microalbuminuria who participated in two 24-month double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials to assess the effects of captopril 50 mg twice daily on the progression to overt clinical albuminuria. Of the 225 patients who were evaluable on an intent to treat basis, 25 of 114 placebo-treated patients (21.9%) and 8 or 111 captopril-treated patients (7.2%) progressed to persistent clinical albuminuria. The risk of progression over 24 months was significantly reduced by captopril (p = 0.004) with a risk reduction of 69.2% (95% confidence interval (CI):31.7 to 86.1%). This degree of risk reduction remained at the same level (62.9% [16.1-83.6%], p = 0.017) after adjustment for differences in time-varying mean arterial blood pressure. Albumin excretion rate increased by an average of 14.2% [3.1-26.5%] per year in the placebo-treated group compared with a reduction of 9.6% [-18.6-0.4%] per year in the captopril-treated group (p = 0.002). The rate of fall of creatinine clearance tended to be faster in the placebo-treated group than in the captopril-treated group (-6.4 [-10.2- -2.5] vs -1.4 [-5.3-2.6] ml.min-1.1.73m-2, p = 0.07). Baseline albumin excretion rate (p < 0.0001) and glycated haemoglobin (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of progression to clinical albuminuria and changes in mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.02) and serum cholesterol level (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with percentage changes in albumin excretion rate. Captopril reduces the risk of progression to overt nephropathy in IDDM patients with microalbuminuria, an effect partly independent of its blood pressure-lowering effects.", 
    "269": "Quinaprilat is the active metabolite of quinapril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The dose-response and duration-of-effect after single intravenous doses of quinaprilat and placebo (part A) and after administration of oral quinapril solution and intravenous quinaprilat (part B) were assessed in a randomized, crossover study of two groups of 12 healthy volunteers. Pharmacodynamic effects of quinaprilat and oral quinapril were assessed by measurement of blood pressure changes after an infusion of angiotensin I (A-I) at a dose previously determined to produce an increase in diastolic blood pressure of 25 mmHg under standardized conditions (A-I pressor response). A clear dose-response relationship was demonstrated for quinaprilat in this pharmacodynamic model, with 0.5 mg as the lowest effective dose. Doses of 1.0 mg and higher partially suppressed A-I pressor response for at least 6 hours. Onset of action was observed within 15 minutes of intravenous administration of quinaprilat and was independent of dose, whereas peak effect and duration of action appeared to be dose related. Quinaprilat doses of 2.5 mg and 10 mg achieved approximately 50% and > 80% inhibition of the A-I pressor response, respectively. In part B, these doses of intravenous quinaprilat were compared with oral doses of quinapril previously found to produce 50% (2.5 mg) and 90% (10 mg) inhibition of the A-I pressor response. The magnitude of effect was similar after administration of 20 mg quinapril orally and 10 mg quinaprilat intravenously. Duration of action was longer, however, after administration of intravenous quinaprilat (10 mg) than after oral quinapril (20 mg), due to the higher maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of quinaprilat. Mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-infinity) of quinaprilat was similar after the 10-mg dose of intravenous quinaprilat and the 20-mg dose of oral quinapril. Based on the concentrations of quinaprilat observed in this study, the absolute bioavailability of quinapril was approximately 50%; intravenous quinaprilat should therefore produce a pharmacodynamic response similar to that obtained with oral quinapril at approximately half the dose.", 
    "270": "Previous studies have demonstrated differences in the progression to glomerulosclerosis with the use of calcium channel blockers (CCB). The results with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more consistent. Moreover, only two studies have examined the combined effects of these drug classes on the development of glomerulosclerosis. The aim of the study presented here was to test the hypothesis that nonhypotensive doses of the combination (VT) of a nondihydropyridine CCB, verapamil (V), and an ACE-inhibitor, trandolapril (T), will slow the development of glomerulosclerosis better than either agent alone in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). SHRSP were randomized to treatment in one of three groups with nonhypotensive doses of these agents; a fourth group served as control (C). The control rats developed significant increases in proteinuria compared with the other groups (C, 190 +/- 35 mg.kg-1.d-1 versus VT, 19 +/- 12 mg.kg-1.d-1; P < 0.05). This finding correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis (mean severity grading for C, 3.31 +/- 0.21 versus VT, 1.6 +/- 0.51; P < 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant reduction in arterial pressure between these groups (C, 282 +/- 5 versus VT, 259 +/- 13 mm Hg; P = 0.12). Despite persisting hypertension, the rise in proteinuria was also attenuated in both the V group (57 +/- 21 mg.kg-1.d-1) and the T group (43 +/- 24 mg.kg-1.d-1). However, compared with the control rats, kidney morphology was unchanged. Lastly, creatinine clearance was better preserved in the VT group compared with the control group (C, 0.57 +/- 0.01 versus VT, 0.74 +/- 0.06 mL.min-1.100 g-1; P < 0.05). It was concluded that the combination of nonhypotensive doses of VT attenuates the rise in proteinuria and progression to glomerulosclerosis. This study supports the concept that VT may have effects on the glomerulus that are independent of blood pressure reduction.", 
    "271": "The effects of nifedipine and enalapril on age-associated renal interstitial fibrosis were investigated in 60 CF1 female mice. Mice received 20 mg enalapril (ENAL) per L (N = 20), or 40 mg nifedipine (NIF) per L (N = 20) in their drinking water. Control (CONT) mice received tap water ad libitum. The percentages of both interstitial peritubular sclerosis (IPS) in cortex and interstitial medullary sclerosis (IMS) were determined. Kidney tissue was studied using immunological techniques and optical (OM) and electron microscopy (EM) to analyze the expression of renin. alpha-SM-actin and vimentine expression were also evaluated. The results showed that blood pressure levels in ENAL or NIF animals were not different from those of CONT. Renin expression was observed in arcuate vessels (AV) in ENAL animals, whereas no renin staining in AV was found in either NIF or CONT animals. Renin immunoreactivity in the juxtaglomerular apparatus was more intense in ENAL mice, as compared with NIF or CONT animals. Laboratory testing showed the following values: proteinuria (mg/mL): CONT 6.1 +/- 0.6, NIF 11.2 +/- 2.3, and ENAL 1.0 +/- 0.6 (P < 0.05); creatinine: CONT 1.37 +/- 0.24, NIF 0.87 +/- 0.16, and ENAL 0.63 +/- 0.1 (P < 0.01). The percentages of interstitial sclerosis were: %IPS: CONT 18.12 +/- 1.1, NIF 17.40 +/- 0.9, and ENAL 3.42 +/- 1.3 (P < 0.01); %IMS: CONT 23.41 +/- 1.5, NIF 21.80 +/- 1.9, and ENAL 6.12 +/- 1.2 (P < 0.01). Percentages of alpha-SM-actin expression were: CONT 13.10 +/- 1.9, NIF 13.80 +/- 0.2, and ENAL 1.00 +/- 0.1 (P < 0.01). Vimentine staining showed no differences among the groups.

    "272": "In experimental renal failure, increased intramyocardial arteriolar wall thickness, reduced myocardial capillary density, and increased cardiac interstitium are found. The extent to which such alterations can be modified by therapeutic interventions has not been investigated to date. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Ramipril, Nifedipine and Moxonidine on these structural changes. Sham-operated and subtotally nephrectomized (SNX) 300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 7 to 11) were left untreated (N = 9) or treated with Ramipril (0.5 mg/kg body wt per day; N = 7), Nifedipine (30 mg/kg body wt per day; N = 9), or Moxonidine (10 mg/kg body wt per day; N = 8) for 8 wk. After perfusion fixation, heart and aorta were examined by stereological techniques. Aortic wall thickness was significantly higher in SNX than in sham-operated control rats and was similarly lowered by all three interventions. In contrast, the wall thickness of intramyocardial arterioles was significantly higher in SNX; this was prevented by Ramipril and Nifedipine, but not by Moxonidine. Intramyocardial capillary length density (Lv) was significantly lower and interstitial volume density (Vv) significantly higher in untreated SNX. Reduction of capillary length density was completely prevented by Moxonidine and in part by Ramipril. The increase in cardiac interstitial volume density was completely prevented by Ramipril and was partially prevented by Moxonidine or Nifedipine treatment. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results: (1) all agents normalize aortic wall thickness, but only calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent intramyocardial arteriolar wall thickening: (2) intramyocardial arteriolar wall thickening, capillary rarefaction, and expansion of the cardiac interstitium are seen in SNX even after lowering the blood pressure to subnormal levels; i.e., changes in systemic blood pressure cannot completely explain the altered vascular structure in renal failure; (3) the effects of Ramipril, Nifedipine, and Moxonidine on cardiovascular structures in experimental renal failure are not completely accounted for by their hemodynamic actions.", 
    "273": "Studies in experimental animals and humans have documented that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduces urinary protein excretion rate and retards the development of renal injury. Here we sought to investigate whether angiotensin II (All) modified the size-selective properties to macromolecules of the glomerular capillary barrier in isolated perfused rat kidney preparation. Compared with basal values, continuous All infusion into the renal artery at the rate of 3 or 8 ng/min, but not at 0.6 ng/min, induced a progressive and significant increase in urinary protein excretion rate. Evaluation of the sieving properties of the glomerular barrier by fractional clearance of polydisperse Ficoll showed that All significantly enhanced the filtration of tracer molecules of radil > or = 34A. All-induced changes in urinary protein excretion rate and in Ficoll fractional clearance were completely prevented by pretreatment with the specific All Type 1 receptor antagonist SR 47436.", 
    "274": "To clearly understand the feedback mechanism of renin secretion by intrarenal angiotensin II synthesis, we studied the stimulatory effect of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on renin release from the isolated perfused guinea pig kidneys. Captopril did not affect the basal renin secretion. Captopril increased on a dose dependent basis renin release induced by 0.1 mg/ml furosemide; 5.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml/hr at 0 mg/ml of captopril vs. 8.8 +/- 1.6 ng/ml/hr at 0.01 mg/ml (p < 0.05) and 11.8 +/- 2.4 ng/ml/hr at 0.1 mg/ml (p < 0.01), 15-20 min after furosemide infusion. After lowering the flow rates from 10 to 5 ml/min, renin secretion was not altered during the first 12 minutes. However, after adding 0.1 mg/ml captopril, renin secretion was enhanced within the following 8 minutes (8.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml/hr at the end of low flow rate period, p < 0.01). Lowering the perfusion flow of the guinea pig kidneys decreases the NaCl flux at the macula densa and also seems to have a similar effect to furosemide. Therefore, these effects of captopril suggest that intrarenal angiotensin II production has an important role in the regulation of renin secretion, probably via effects on the macula densa function.",

    "276": "Microalbuminuria is the presence of albumin above the normal but below the detectable range with the conventional urine dipstick methodology. Microalbuminuria is present in a variety of renal and non-renal diseases but only recently has its importance as a prognostic indicator been appreciated. It is an independent risk factor for renal mortality in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and most probably for those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Moreover, it is associated with a four- to sixfold increase in cardiovascular mortality in diabetic subjects. Its role as a prognostic indicator in non-diabetic subjects is controversial. The available data suggest that it is not an independent risk factor in patients without diabetes, including hypertensive subjects. Moreover, in this latter group it appears to be simply a reflection of events that result in tissue injury from elevated arterial pressures rather than an initiator of injury. The converse may be true in the diabetic patient. A large body of data also exists to support the notion of early aggressive intervention to attenuate the rise of microalbuminuria with blood glucose control. In addition, agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate both the rise in microalbuminuria and progression of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus nephropathy. Fewer but similar findings have been reported for subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus nephropathy. Thus, microalbuminuria should be assessed annually in all diabetic subjects. Routine screening for microalbuminuria in hypertensive non-diabetic subjects is not recommended at this time.", 
    "277": "We hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion polymorphism may be related to arterial phenotypic differences that could explain the adverse effects of deletion polymorphism. Accordingly, contractile responses to angiotensin I and II (0.1 nmol.1(-1)-1 micromol.1(-1), endothelium-dependent relaxation to methacholine (0.01-100 micromol.1(-1), and the effect of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 100 micromol.1(-1) on phenylephrine (10 micromol.1(-1) induced contraction, were studied in isolated rings of internal mammary arteries obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The results were analysed according to the ACE genotype of the patient (II, n = 8; ID, n = 11; DD, n = 9) as well as the presence/absence of either allele. The arteries from patients with the D allele (ID/DD) displayed a lower sensitivity to methacholine (P < 0.05 vs II), which suggested that the capacity of the endothelium for nitric oxide release in response to stimulation was also lower. By contrast, the increase in phenylephrine-induced contraction, by pre-incubation with L-NMMA, was more pronounced in the group with the DD allele (31 +/- 5%) than with the ID (11 +/- 11%) and II alleles (1 +/- 11%, P < 0.05 vs DD), which suggested a higher level of basal nitric oxide release. Finally, the differences in the responses to angiotensin I and II, which were used to evaluate the vascular conversion of angiotensin I, indicated that the level of angiotensin I conversion was higher in patients with the D allele (ID/DD, P < 0.05 vs II). The findings of this study indicate that ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism is related to arterial phenotypic differences in endothelial function and angiotensin I conversion.",

The average additional costs per patient are estimated at DF1 2,491 in 4 years and at DF1 8,723 in 20 years of treatment. Costs per additional survivor after 4 years are estimated at DF1 69,126. After extrapolation of the results of the SAVE trial to 20 years, costs per life-year gained can be estimated at DF1 15,799. From univariate sensitivity analysis it appears that the results are highly sensitive for the costs of treatment with captopril and the occurrence and prevention of clinical heart failure. Varying all estimates randomly between upper and lower limits-in 5,000 simulations-an estimate of costs per life-year gained of DF1 15,729 is made for 20 years of treatment, with 95% of all estimates between DF10 and DF1 50, 000.

    "281": "Hypertension is both an exacerbating factor for, and a consequence of, diabetic renal disease. In diabetic patients, hypertension is associated with increased total body sodium secondary to impaired renal excretion, and increased vascular reactivity, notably to catecholamines and angiotensin II. The mechanisms causing these changes are discussed. Control of hypertension will slow the progression of diabetic renal disease and the inexorable decline in GFR. A number of studies now suggest that in proteinuric IDDM and NIDDM patients angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) may have additional reno-protective effects in addition to their hypotensive action. In addition ACE-I will reduce proteinuria and delay the onset of diabetic nephropathy in normotensive microalbuminuric IDDM and NIDDM patients. Use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring indicates that such patients may not be truly 'normotensive'. On-going studies seem to suggest that the most reno-protective blood pressure is the lowest one achievable, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Further studies are required to assess the impact of blood pressure control, and especially ACE-I, on the incidence of end-stage renal failure. In addition, more direct comparisons between different pharmacological agents in early diabetic renal disease would be useful.",

Plasma, urine, faeces, and bile were assayed for total and hplc-fractionated radioactivity. 2. Only one major metabolite (M1, 2-sarcosinamide-cis-1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylamide) was observed, along with idrapril, in plasma. Three metabolites (M1, M2, cis-1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, and M3, a glucuronate derivative of M1) were present in 0-8-h urine, unchanged idrapril being the most abundant product. In bile, two metabolites (M1, M3), but not the parent compound, were found. 3. In conclusion intravenous idrapril undergoes hepatic reduction to M1 and hydrolysis to M2. M1 can be glucuronated to M3 and both are partially excreted in the bile and further processed in the gut to reabsorbable radioactive species.", 
    "283": "1. The ability of angiotensin II to modulate dopamine release from rat striatal slices in vitro and in the intact rat striatum in vivo was assessed by the microdialysis technique. 2. In slices of rat striatum, angiotensin II (0.1-1.0 microM) induced a concentration-related increase in endogenous dopamine release which was maximal (approximately 250% above basal levels) within the first 2-4 min of agonist application and subsequently declined to near basal values. The angiotensin II-induced increase in dopamine release was Ca(2+)-dependent and was completely antagonized by the selective AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (1.0 microM). In contrast, the AT2 receptor antagonist, PD123177 (1.0 microM) failed to modify the angiotensin II-induced response. Neither antagonist alone modified basal dopamine release from striatal slices. 3. In freely moving rats, angiotensin II (1.0-10 microM; administered via the microdialysis probe) induced a concentration-related increase in extracellular levels of dopamine which was maximal (approximately 150% above basal levels) within 20-40 min of agonist application and subsequently declined. The angiotensin II (10 microM)-induced increase in extracellular levels of dopamine was completely antagonized by the AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (0.1-1.0 microM; administered via the microdialysis probe) but not by the AT2 receptor antagonist, PD123177 (1.0 microM; administered via the microdialysis probe). Neither antagonist alone modified basal extracellular levels of dopamine. 4. Homogenate radioligand binding studies with [125I]-angiotensin II (0.1 nm) identified relatively low levels of specific binding sites in rat striatal homogenates compared to homogenates of pyriform cortex (51.3 +/- 9.2 and 651.3 +/- 55.1 fmol g-1 wet weight, respectively, mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 3; non-specific binding defined by unlabelled angiotensin II). The majority of the specific [125I]-angiotensin II (0.1 nM) binding in the striatal and pyriform cortex homogenates was sensitive to the selective AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (1.0 microM). 5. In conclusions the present study provides direct evidence that angiotensin II acting via the AT1 receptor subtype facilitates the release of dopamine in the rat striatum in vitro and in vivo. This receptor-mediated response may account for the modulation of dopamine-mediated behavioural responses by antagonists of the AT1 receptor and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "284": "1. The present investigation was undertaken to study the role of bradykinin in noradrenaline release from the ventricle of the rat induced by electrical stimulation. Slices of the left ventricle of adult Wistar rats with or without endocardium were previously loaded with 0.2 microM [3H]-noradrenaline and washed out before electrical stimulation was applied. 2. Bradykinin (0.1-100 nM) concentration-dependently increased tritium release evoked by electrical stimulation (EC50 = 3.5 (1.2-10.2) nM; n = 12). The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (1 microM), which per se had no effect on tritium release, caused a marked enhancement of the bradykinin facilitatory effect, shifting the concentration-response curve of bradykinin to the left by about one log unit. The compound Hoe 140, a selective inhibitor of B2-bradykinin receptors, competitively antagonized the effect of bradykinin, indicating the involvement of these receptors in the action of bradykinin. 3. In endocardium-free ventricle, bradykinin had no effect either in the absence or in the presence of captopril. 4. These results show that: (1) bradykinin is able to facilitate noradrenaline release evoked by electrical stimulation of the rat ventricle through activation of B2-bradykinin receptors located on endocardial cells; (2) this action of bradykinin which is markedly potentiated by the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme seems to be exerted through the release of some factor which is formed in the endocardium and diffuses into the myocardium where it acts.",

The pattern of first drug prescription changed from 85% to 90% of patients given diuretics or beta-blockers in I to 90% begun on calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in II and finally, to an even distribution of drugs in III. Blood pressure response was similar across the three periods, 135/89 mm Hg (I), 138/89 (II), and 140/89 (III). Proportion of patients remaining on their initial drug in each period was fairly similar (60%, 67%, and 69%). Scheduled clinic visits fell significantly from 7.4 visits in I, 6.9 in II, and 6.4 in III (I upsilon III P = .004). Dropouts diminished significantly from 17% in I, to 10% in II, and 9% in III (I upsilon II or III P = .045). Modest positive changes in cholesterol and fasting blood sugar level occurred over time. In this general community setting, dramatic shifts in the choice of initial drug based upon application of JNC guidelines had little discernable impact on short term patient outcomes.", 
    "286": "Experimental and human studies indicate that altered glomerular permeability to proteins correlates with tubulointerstitial injury and subsequent glomerular scarring. Maneuvers that restore the selectivity of glomerular barrier to macromolecules limit renal injury in progressive nephropathies. The abnormal traffic of proteins through the glomerular capillary has an intrinsic renal toxicity linked to the process of over-reabsorption by proximal tubular cells. Excessive protein reabsorption induces functional alterations of tubular cells that overexpress inflammatory and vasoactive molecules, as indicated by in vitro or in vivo studies. Thus monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and osteopontin may attract inflammatory cells into renal interstitium. Enhanced tubular endothelin-1 secretion, mainly toward the basolateral membrane of the cell, may stimulate interstitial macrophage infiltration and in addition may promote interstitial fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis, thus amplifying tubulointerstitial inflammation and injury.",

To assess the risk of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with a history of syncope during standard medical treatment we compared this group to similar patients without syncope. Twenty-three patients with angiographically proven dilated cardiomyopathy and syncope were followed prospectively and compared to 201 patients without history of syncope. All patients showed a left-ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45%. Both groups did not differ in left-ventricular ejection fraction at baseline (30 +/- 7% in the syncope group, 30 +/- 8% in the no syncope group). Mean follow-up was 2.6 years in the syncope group and 2.4 years in the no syncope group. At baseline, syncope patients used more often amiodarone (p < 0.04), while there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the intake of digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Twenty-six percent of patients in the syncope group and 20% in the no syncope group died during follow-up (non significant). The striking difference, however, was the type of death: 5 out of 6 patients in the syncope group died suddenly compared to 13 of 41 patients in the no syncope group (p < 0.025). Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and a history of syncope are at high risk of sudden death.",

Estrogen replacement therapy is currently under clinical investigation. Avoidance of obesity and tight control of diabetes are prudent interventions as yet unproved by clinical trials. Unfortunately, preventive strategies are frequently underutilized.

    "292": "1. Among patients with cerebrovascular disease, there is a direct and continuous association between blood pressure and the risk of stroke, but previous trials of blood pressure lowering in this patient group have been inconclusive. 2. PROGRESS (Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study) is a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that aims to determine reliably the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based blood pressure lowering on stroke risk in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease. If a 4 week run-in period on active perindopril is well tolerated, participants are randomized to either perindopril (4 mg) +/- indapamide (2.5 mg) or matching placebo(s). The primary study outcome is stroke and follow-up is for a minimum of 4 years. 3. For the pilot study nearly 5000 medical records were screened and 60 patients with recent cerebrovascular events were approached directly in hospital or at a clinic visit. Sixty-seven patients entered the run-in phase (52 from retrospective screening and 15 by prospective approach) and 60 patients proceeded to randomization. Treatment with perindopril was well tolerated; only three patients were withdrawn due to side effects and four were withdrawn for other reasons. The mean age of randomized patients was 68 years; 70% were male and 55% were 'non-hypertensive'. The mean entry blood pressure was 142/83 mmHg and following pre-randomization treatment this was reduced by 7/4 mmHg. 4. Most patients were identified by retrospective review of medical records, but this was less efficient than prospective methods. Blood pressure lowering was well tolerated by both hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with cerebrovascular disease. The small numbers of patients and the non-randomized nature of the data reported limit the conclusions that can be drawn, but the results confirm the feasibility of the main study.",

    "294": "We studied heart rate variability (HRV) using spectral analysis techniques in 58 adult patients recovering from general anaesthesia. The aim was to discover how HRV was affected by a variety of common preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors. ECG, respiration, level of consciousness, nausea, pain and arterial pressure were recorded during the first hour of recovery from general anaesthesia. HRV was found to decrease with increased weight, age, complexity of operation, use of reversal agents for neuromuscular block and preoperative beta-block. These effects were not mediated by changes in respiration. HRV was unaffected by administration of morphine. The level of nausea or pain had no effect on HRV except that pain decreased the relative ratio of high frequency to low frequency power within the power spectrum. In the group of patients that did not receive reversal agents, there was an abrupt increase in HRV when patients became responsive to verbal command.", 
    "295": "We studied 22 patients undergoing aortic surgery, allocated randomly to receive, before induction of anaesthesia, a single i.v. dose of enalapril 50 micrograms kg-1 or saline. During infrarenal aortic cross-clamping, we observed similar reductions in oxygen uptake in the two groups, despite greater systemic oxygen delivery in enalapril-treated patients; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition prevented the reduction in cardiac output and attenuated the decrease in glomerular filtration. Changes in glomerular filtration secondary to aortic clamping were related positively to changes in renal plasma flow (r = 0.83 (saline group) and r = 0.65 (enalapril group)). Creatinine clearance on the first day after operation was significantly higher in the enalapril compared with the saline group. We conclude that enalapril pretreatment is effective in improving systemic oxygen delivery, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration during aortic abdominal surgery.", 
    "296": "1. The mechanism of renal protection by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is still the subject of debate. Inhibition of proteinuria might play a role. If so, a good antiproteinuric response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition should predict subsequent protection against renal structural damage. This hypothesis has not been tested in models where treatment is started after the renal disease is well established, i.e. models that mimic the clinical situation. 2. We therefore investigated this hypothesis in 96 male Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. Reduction of proteinuria was achieved by lisinopril (0, 2, 5 and 10 mg day-1 kg-1) on two different sodium diets (0.3% and 0.05% NaCl). Therapy started 6 weeks after adriamycin (at stable proteinuria) and was continued for 6 weeks. 3. Lisinopril reduced blood pressure by 32 +/- 4% and proteinuria by an average of 72 +/- 7%, with stabilization after 2 weeks. Considerable interindividual differences in antiproteinuric response was found. Glomerulosclerosis score was reduced by 15 +/- 5%. All the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were enhanced by sodium depletion, but sodium depletion in itself did not affect blood pressure (124 +/- 4 mmHg), proteinuria (664 +/- 68 mg/day) or glomerulosclerosis score (30 +/- 5%). Interestingly, the more proteinuria was reduced initially in an individual rat, the less sclerosis was found in the long term in that rat. 4. In conclusion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition lowers proteinuria and prevents glomerulosclerosis in established adriamycin nephrosis. These effects are enhanced by sodium depletion. The individual short-term antiproteinuric effect predicts the protection against ultimate glomerular damage. This is consistent with the hypothesis that reduction of proteinuria is a mechanism by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert renoprotection.",

Pretreatment with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 micromol/L intracoronary) to block nitric oxide synthase attenuated ramiprilat-induced increase in epicardial coronary cross-sectional area (P<.05) but not in coronary flow velocity or coronary blood flow. In contrast, pretreatment with the selective bradykinin antagonist HOE 140 (10 micromol/L) attenuated ramiprilat-induced increase in flow velocity (P<.025) and coronary blood flow (P<.05) but not epicardial coronary cross-sectional area.

Tolerance develops very rapidly during oral, transdermal or intravenous nitrate administration and treatment strategies designed to provide therapeutic effects throughout 24 h each day are associated with marked attenuation of nitrate effects. The mechanisms responsible for tolerance are not clearly understood. The hypotheses put forward to explain this phenomenon include reduction of sulfhydryl groups in vascular smooth muscle with resultant diminished nitric oxide production, neurohormonal activation, plasma volume expansion, and superoxide anion production. Attempts to prevent or reverse tolerance with sulfhydryl group donors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and hydralazine have not been uniformly successful and such approaches are impractical.

    "316": "The effects of amlodipine and perindopril on renal hemodynamics and tubular function in cyclosporine-treated hypertensive renal allograft recipients were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. Ten patients were studied after a 2-week placebo run-in and, after 8 weeks of active treatment, allowing a 2-week placebo washout between treatments. At the end of each period, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured as 51Cr-EDTA and 123I-hippuran clearance, respectively, and tubular function evaluated by the lithium clearance technique was determined. Both drugs maintained GFR and ERPF and lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) to a similar extent (time x treatment, P = 0.466): amlodipine from 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 115.9 +/- 2.2; perindopril from 126.9 +/- 2.5 to 117.9 +/- 3.9 (time effect of all treatments together, P = 0.003). Accordingly, renal vascular resistance (RVR, mm Hg/mL/min/1.73 m2) was equally reduced (time x treatment, P = 0.955): amlodipine from 0.36 +/- 0.03 to 0.30 +/- 0.02; perindopril from 0.36 +/- 0.03 to 0.32 +/- 0.01 (time effect all treatments together, P = 0.043). Sodium clearance and fractional excretion of sodium were not affected by either drug. Output of fluid from the proximal tubules measured as clearance of lithium (CLi, mL/min) and uric acid (CUr, mL/min) was higher after amlodipine than after perindopril (CLi 19.1 +/- 2.1 v 16.5 +/- 1.7, P =0.036 and CUr 7.0 +/- 0.6 v 5.9 +/- 0.4, P = 0.007). As a consequence, after amlodipine, distal absolute reabsorption of sodium was higher (DARNa 2.57 +/- 0.28 v 2.19 +/- 0.22 mEq/min, P = 0.027) and serum uric acid was lower (5.9 +/- 0.3 v 6.7 +/- 0.4 mg/dL, P = 0.001) in comparison with perindopril. In cyclosporine-treated renal allograft hypertensives, amlodipine and perindopril lower blood pressure equally and reduce RVR to the same extent.

    "317": "We have used an animal model of insulin resistance-the obese Zucker (fa/fa) rat-to test whether oral administration of the non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril, alone or in combination with the Ca2+-channel blocker, verapamil, can induce a beneficial effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport and metabolism in skeletal muscle. Insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in the isolated epitrochlearis muscle was less than 50% as great in obese animals compared with lean (Fa/-) controls (P < .05), but was significantly improved in the obese group by both short-term (6 hours, +33%) and long-term (14 days,+70%) oral treatment with trandolapril. Verapamil treatment alone did not alter insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake in muscle, but simultaneous administration of verapamil and trandolapril resulted in the most pronounced effect on insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake (+106%). Long-term treatment with trandolapril alone and in combination with verapamil significantly increased muscle glycogen (+26% to 27%), glucose transporter GLUT-4 protein (+27% to 31%), and hexokinase activity (+21% to 49%), and decreased plasma insulin levels (-23% to -29%). Muscle citrate synthase activity was enhanced only when trandolapril and verapamil were administered in combination (+24%). We conclude that the long-acting, non-sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, trandolapril, alone and in combination with the Ca2+-channel blocker, verapamil, can significantly improve insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle of the insulin-resistant obese Zucker rat, and that this improvement is associated with favorable adaptive responses in GLUT-4 protein levels, glycogen storage, and activities of relevant intracellular enzymes of glucose catabolism.", 
    "318": "We have previously reported that the nonselective lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone is a potent hypotensive agent in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). In the present study, we examined the relationship between production of platelet 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and intra-arterial blood pressure in SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) using both a cross-sectional analysis and an acute pharmacological intervention. Basal generation rate of 12-HETE by platelets collected from the SHR was approximately 3.7-fold higher than in the WKY (0.86 +/- 0.24 versus 0.23 +/- 0.05 nmol/mL per 10 minutes, respectively; P < .01). Systolic arterial pressure was positively related to platelet 12-HETE formation rate when the entire rat population was considered (r = .70, P < .001). The specific 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxycyanocinnamate induced lowering of both arterial blood pressure and platelet 12-lipoxygenase activity in SHR. At 15 mg/kg, cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxycyanocinnamate elicited a marked hypotensive effect in SHR but not in WKY. This reduction in arterial pressure was accompanied by an approximate 70% inhibition in platelet 12-HETE production rate. The return of high blood pressure to basal levels was associated with a significant rise in the production of platelet 12-HETE toward control values (baseline, 0.97 +/- 0.33 nmol/mL per 10 minutes; nadir of blood pressure, 0.19 +/- 0.03; resumption of basal pressure, 0.42 +/- 0.14). In contrast, captopril (15 mg/kg) induced a quantitatively similar decrease in blood pressure but had no effect on platelet 12-HETE generation rate. Thus, hypertension in SHR is linked to increased production rate of platelet 12-HETE. Acute blood pressure reduction attained during lipoxygenase inhibition but not by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition leads to a concomitant reduction in the production of platelet 12-HETE. We speculate that since rat arterial tissue produces 12-HETE, increased 12-lipoxygenase activity in SHR may contribute to the maintenance of elevated arterial pressure in this strain.", 
    "319": "To date, no clinical study shows an improvement in coronary flow reserve due to long-term antihypertensive therapy. in view of the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the process of hypertensive remodeling of the heart and coronary circulation, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors might act as cardioreparative drugs in arterial hypertension. Accordingly, our objective in this investigation was to examine under clinical conditions to what extent long-term antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor improved the diminished coronary flow reserve in hypertensive patients with microvascular angina pectoris. For the purpose of comparison, we also treated a normotensive control group of 6 patients with hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Fifteen hypertensive individuals (10 men, 5 women; age, 58 +/- 6 years) were treated with enalapril (10 to 20 mg/d; mean, 16.7 +/- 4.9 mg/d) for 11 to 13 months. At the end of the treatment period, systolic pressure decreased from 178 +/- 14 to 137 +/- 12 mm Hg and diastolic pressure from 102 +/- 11 to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg under ambulatory conditions. Left ventricular muscle mass index decreased by 8%, from 149 +/- 32 to 137 +/- 28 g/m2 (P < .05). Maximal coronary blood flow after dipyridamole was increased by 43%, from 181 +/- 69 to 258 +/- 116 mL/min per 100 g (P < .001), and minimal coronary vascular resistance was diminished by 29%, from 0.66 +/- 0.23 to 0.47 +/- 0.24 mm Hg x min x 100g x mL-1 (P < .001) after enalapril treatment. Consequently, the calculated coronary reserve increased from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 3.3 +/- 1.2 (P < .001). After enalapril therapy, the functional class of angina pectoris according to the Canadian classification system had changed from 2.5 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 (P < .01). The maximal working capacity had increased from 23.775 +/- 3.970 to 26.255 +/- 4.598 J (mean +/- SE, P < .05). The maximal ST-segment depression at maximal work-load was reduced from 0.18 +/- 0.02 to 0.06 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE, (P < .01). In summary, long-term therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril must be considered a cardioreparative treatment with respect to the coronary microcirculation in hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "320": "Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) on autonomic responses and hemodynamics in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) subjected to isometric exercise have not been studied. We tested whether acute ACEI might influence the effects of isometric exercise in patients with CHF. In the first part of the study we showed that isometric exercise increased blood pressure in the control group and in the CHF group, whereas cardiac output increased only in the control group. Stroke volume remained unchanged in the control group, whereas it decreased significantly in CHF group. We next analyzed the effect of acute ACEI (5 mg ramipril) on the decrease in cardiac output during isometric stress in patients with CHF. During isometric exercise mean blood pressure and heart rate increased similarly in both groups. However, cardiac output decreased during placebo by -0.48 +/- 0.12 L/min (p < 0.01) but not during ACEI. Spectral analysis of blood pressure showed an increase (p < 0.01) in the high-frequency parasympathetic component from 7.3% +/- 3.6% to 18.1% +/- 9.5% after ACEI. norepinephrine plasma levels increased after isometric stress in the placebo group, whereas other hormones did not change. ACEI prevented the norepinephrine increase after isometric stress. Thus the decrease in cardiac output during isometric exercise in patients with CHF was prevented by acute ACEI. The effect of ACE inhibition may be related to reduced sympathetic activity.", 
    "321": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a major contributor in the regulation of blood pressure, and pharmacologic manipulation of this system has resulted in a beneficial class of therapeutic agents, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, ACE inhibitors are not specific for RAS, and in addition, they can affect bradykinin and prostaglandin, which can also cause changes in vascular tone. Under development are renin inhibitors that are specific for angiotensinogen and act at the initial, rate-determining step of the RAS cascade. The various pharmacologic approaches to renin inhibition include specific renin antibodies, synthetic derivatives of the prosegment of renin precursor, pepstatin analogs, and angiotensinogen analogs. The last approach is the most promising for patient therapy. Multiple studies have shown the effectiveness of the renin inhibitors in both primates and human beings. Further research is now directed toward the development of an agent with good oral bioavailability for patient treatment and as a biologic probe for helping to understand the role of the RAS in control of blood pressure and blood volume.",

    "328": "Isoelectric focusing of MCF-7 cell extracts revealed an association of the glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase. This complex between the glycolytic enzymes is sensitive to RNase. p36 could not be detected within this association of glycolytic enzymes; however an association of p36 with a specific form of malate dehydrogenase was found. In MCF-7 cells three forms of malate dehydrogenase can be detected by isoelectric focusing: the mitochondrial form with an isoelectric point between 8.9 and 9.5, the cytosolic form with pl 5.0, and a p36-associated form with pl 7.8. The mitochondrial form comprises the mature mitochondrial isoenzyme (pl 9.5) and its precursor form (pl 8.9). Refocusing of the pl 7.8 form of malate dehydrogenase also gave rise to the mitochondrial isoenzyme. Thus, the pl 7.8 form of malate dehydrogenase is actually the mitochondrial isoenzyme retained in the cytosol by the association with p36. Addition of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to the initial focusing column induced a quantitative shift of the pl 7.8 form of malate dehydrogenase to the mitochondrial forms (pl 8.9 and 9.5). In MCF-7 cells p36 is not phosphorylated in tyrosine. Kinetic measurements revealed that the pl 7.8 form of malate dehydrogenase has the lowest affinity for NADH. Compared to both mitochondrial forms the cytosolic isoenzyme has a high capacity when measured in the NAD --> NADH direction (malate --> oxaloacetate direction). The association of p36 with the mitochondrial isoenzyme may favor the flow of hydrogen from the cytosol into the mitochondria. Inhibition of cell proliferation by AMP which leads to an inhibition of glycolysis has no effect on complex formation by glycolytic and glutaminolytic enzymes in MCF-7 cells. AMP treatment leads to an activation of malate dehydrogenase, which correlates with the increase of pyruvate and the decrease of lactate levels, but has no effect on the distribution of the various malate dehydrogenase forms.", 
    "329": "Hypertensive emergency is an acute, perilous state connected with a marked increase of peripheral vascular resistance and the decrease of tissue perfusion. Its development depends on the rate of blood pressure elevation, on the severity of developed hypertension and the state of the vascular system. Although hypertensive emergencies can be grouped also on symptomatological and etiological basis, regarding the therapeutic measures to be taken, they appear in two well distinguishable forms. In case of hypertensive crisis treatment has to be started without delay, possibly in a few minutes, in states involving the risk of hypertensive crisis treatment has to be initiated within a few hours to avoid extensive damage of the vital organs or fatal outcome. The acute, but controlled reduction of blood pressure must not surpass 15-25% of the medium value. In hypertensive crisis, if possible, parenteral medication--as first aid--urapidil, verapamil, in states with endangering hypertensive crisis sublingual nifedipine, captopril, nitroglycerin may be applied, however in the different emergency states therapeutic intervention has to be individually determined.", 
    "330": "Management of patients with renal artery stenoses is aimed at normalizing or reducing blood pressure and correcting or preventing reduced glomerular filtration. The results of renal revascularization have been documented mainly in retrospective, uncontrolled reports in which blood pressure improvement was overestimated due to the placebo effect and optimization of drug treatment, the latter being frequently required despite adequate revascularization. In an overview of 10 series reporting blood pressure outcome following percutaneous angioplasty, cure rates were 50% in patients with fibrodysplastic stenosis but only 19% in those with atherosclerotic stenosis. The literature on revascularization of atherosclerotic stenosis with progressive renal failure shows that 55% of patients have improved renal function following surgery and 41% following angioplasty. Mortality is 6 and 5% respectively. The first controlled trials comparing revascularization to medical treatment in renal artery stenosis have recently been published. In a prospective randomized trial, Weibull et al. compared percutaneous angioplasty and surgery in 58 patients with unilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. Although 17% of the patients initially treated with angioplasty required subsequent surgery, blood pressure, renal function and renal artery patency rate did not differ between angioplasty and surgery 24 months after treatment. A Scottish group reported a prospective randomized trial of percutaneous angioplasty vs. medical therapy in patients with bilateral or unilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. In the bilateral group (n = 28), the drop in systolic pressure was significantly larger following angioplasty than following medical therapy, but diastolic pressure and creatinine did not differ after 24 months. In the unilateral group (n = 27), there were no differences in blood pressure or creatinine levels following angioplasty or medical therapy. Several randomized trials comparing angioplasty and conservative treatment or angioplasty and stent placement in patients with renal artery stenosis and normal or reduced renal function are currently underway. They should provide additional information regarding the risk/benefit ratio of these procedures.", 
    "331": "There is pharmacological evidence indicating that, in addition to the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1), the potentiation of bradykinin (BK) responses may also involve the BK receptor or some binding site in the structures involved in the contractile response to this peptide. Dipeptides such as Val-Trp and some of its analogues as well as tripeptide homologues, including total and partial retro-inverso peptides, were synthesized and assayed for their ability to inhibit purified guinea pig plasma ACE and to potentiate the action of BK on the isolated ileum of the same species. The peptides containing the P2-P1, P1-P'1, and P'1-P'2 inverted amide bonds inhibited ACE, were resistant to hydrolysis, and, depending on the amino acid composition, some of them potentiated the contractile response to BK while others did not. Des-[Arg1]-BK, which has an intrinsic activity at concentrations higher than 10(-5) M, and the very dissimilar angiotensin I (AI) analogue [Cys5-Cys10]-angiotensin-I-(5-10)-amide, which has no detectable contractile activity, were able to inhibit ACE and potentiate BK. In contrast to these peptides, BPP5a and BPP9a from Bothrops jararaca venom, and Potentiators B and C from Agkistrodon halys blomhoffi venom were more effective as BK potentiators than as ACE inhibitors. In conclusion, we have synthesized and assayed compounds that preferentially inhibit ACE, e.g. retro-inverso tripeptides, or potentiate the response of smooth muscle to BK, e.g. snake venom peptides.",

    "335": "To determine whether growth factors in the glomerulus are induced in the renin suppressed hypertensive model, we examined the mRNA expressions of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors in the glomeruli of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt-treated hypertensive rats (DOCA-treated rats). We also examined the effects of treatment with cilazapril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and L-158,809, an AT1 receptor antagonist, on these expressions in DOCA-treated rats. We administered oral 10 mg/kg of cilazapril (CILAZA group) and 1 mg/kg of L-158,809 (L158 group) to DOCA-treated rats daily. Systolic blood pressure in the two groups was not decreased compared with that in DOCA-treated rats given saline. The mRNA expressions were examined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. The mRNA expressions of these genes were higher in DOCA-treated rats than in age-matched control rats. After treatment with these agents for 4 weeks, the mRNA expressions of growth factors were suppressed in both the CILAZA and L158 groups. Mesangial expansion and cell proliferation observed in DOCA-treated rats were suppressed in both the CILAZA and L158 groups. Decreases in the size of the glomerulus were observed only in the CILAZA group. These findings suggested that suppression of growth factors and glomerular proliferative changes of these agents are mediated by blocking tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the renin-suppressed model.",

A rechallenge with the ACE-inhibitor is dangerous and should not be performed. Because of its potential risks, further treatment with ACE-inhibitors should be avoided in all patients with ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema. Possible therapeutic alternatives include diuretics, beta-blocking agents, calcium antagonists and also angiotensin II receptor antagonists.", 
    "337": "The use of ACE-inhibitors in heart failure has been established over the past years. Their use is of uncertain value in the early phases of myocardial infarction, where they are supposed to prevent left ventricular dilatation. More recent studies (ISIS-4, GISSI-3) have tested early treatment by ACE-inhibitors in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. On one hand, it was possible to disprove reservations about risks (hypotension)n in a large cohort; on the other hand, a further reduction of mortality in hospitalized patients by 7% has been shown, corresponding to five patient lives saved for 1000 treated patients. Thus, after institution of the customary therapy of myocardial infarction (inhibitor of platelet aggregation, thrombolysis, beta-blocker) and after exclusion of specific contraindications (hypotension < 100 mmHg, renal failure) ACE-inhibitors could be administered in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. An analysis of the results from these large trials will show whether ACE-inhibitors may benefit groups of patients at particular risks (Killip > 1, age > 70 years, preceding renal failure) noticeably. ACE-inhibitors remain the treatment of choice in patients with developing left ventricular failure.",

The participants were taking beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or calcium antagonists; those taking combinations of these drugs were excluded. The incidence of GIH was assessed by surveying hospital discharge diagnoses and deaths.

    "342": "The angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) are involved in the regulation of the specific maturation or degradation of a number of mammalian bioactive peptides. A carboxydipeptidase similar to mammalian ACE has now been identified in the adult stage of the haematophagous fly, Haematobia irritans exigua (buffalo fly), a close relative of the horn fly of North America. The enzyme was purified by lectin-affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography and migrated as a doublet of 70 kDa upon reducing SDS/PAGE. Unlike mammalian ACE, the fly carboxydipeptidase (HieACE) is not membrane bound. The amino acid sequence of an internal peptide from HieACE and a conserved amino acid region present in all mammalian ACE were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers suitable for PCR. A DNA fragment amplified from adult buffalo fly cDNA was used to identify a cDNA clone that encoded the enzyme. The cDNA sequence encodes a carboxydipeptidase with 41-42% amino acid identity to the mammalian testicular ACE. The active-site regions of mammalian ACE are conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of HieACE. Enzymatically, HieACE is very similar to its mammalian counterparts, with comparable Km and V(max) values for the synthetic substrate, benzoylglycylglycylglycine, and similar patterns of inhibition by EDTA, ACE inhibitor peptide and captopril. HieACE also specifically activates angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades other mammalian ACE substrates such as bradykinin, substance P and cholecystokinin-8. In the adult fly, HieACE is expressed in the compound ganglion and in the posterior region of the midgut. Similar to the mammalian system, expression of this enzyme is induced in the maturing male reproductive system, which suggests conservation of ACE function in these species.", 
    "343": "Because they provide relief of symptoms and reduce mortality, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become a highly recommended part of the pharmacologic treatment of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Although clinical trials suggest that 80% to 90% of patients with CHF tolerate ACE inhibitors, recent surveys reveal that for fewer than this number of patients are actually receiving these drugs. The reasons for this discrepancy are not known. To better understand physician-prescribing behavior, the current study examined the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and medical care characteristics of patients treated and not treated with ACE inhibitors during hospitalization for decompensated CHF. The charts of a consecutive series of patients admitted to 2 acute care hospitals during 1992 (n = 424) were reviewed and comparisons made between those receiving and not receiving ACE inhibitors at the time of hospital admission and hospital discharge. In addition, measures of in-hospital and postdischarge outcome were compared between the groups. The results revealed significant differences in certain demographic variables (e.g., patient age), clinical measures (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction and serum creatinine), management issues (e.g., documentation of left ventricular function and documentation of etiology of CHF), and treatment strategies (e.g., ancillary drug use). Few differences were noted in measures of severity of CHF (e.g., New York Heart Association functional class and serum sodium level). Death rates were significantly higher for those not receiving ACE inhibitors. Patterns that emerged that could explain under-prescription ACE inhibitors included older age, worse renal function, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, use of alternate vasodilators, and overall less intense medical management. Programs to educate care providers regarding the proper use of ACE inhibitors in CHF are recommended.",

The downregulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors and their uncoupling from the effector as well as an increased expression of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein seem to be the most important alterations. Since catecholamine levels are elevated in these patients and since some alterations can be 'restored' after treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists it was hypothesized that excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation could be involved in these alterations. In this article the changes of beta-adrenergic receptors, GTP-binding proteins, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and of phospholamban found in heart failure are addressed with its possible therapeutic implications.", 
    "351": "Generally, bioanalytical chromographic methods are validated according to a predefined programme and distinguish a pre-validation phase, a main validation phase and a follow-up validation phase. In this paper, a rational, total performance evaluation programme for chromatographic methods is presented. The design was developed in particular for the pre-validation and main validation phases. The entire experimental design can be performed within six analytical runs. The first run (pre-validation phase) is used to assess the validity of the expected concentration-response relationship (lack of fit, goodness of fit), to assess specificity of the method and to assess the stability of processed samples in the autosampler for 30 h (benchtop stability). The latter experiment is performed to justify overnight analyses. Following approval of the method after the pre-validation phase, the next five runs (main validation phase) are performed to evaluate method precision and accuracy, recovery, freezing and thawing stability and over-curve control/dilution. The design is nested, i.e., many experimental results are used for the evaluation of several performance characteristics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used for the evaluation of lack of fit and goodness of fit, precision and accuracy, freezing and thawing stability and over-curve control/dilution. Regression analysis is used to evaluate benchtop stability. For over-curve control/dilution, additional to ANOVA, also a paired comparison is applied. As a consequence, the recommended design combines the performance of as few independent validation experiments as possible with modern statistical methods, resulting in optimum use of information. A demonstration of the entire validation programme is given for an HPLC method for the determination of total captopril in human plasma.",

The severity of renal insufficiency was classified according to the base-line creatinine clearance: 227 patients had mild insufficiency (creatinine clearance, 46 TO 60 ml per minute), and 356 had moderate insufficiency (creatinine clearance, 30 to 45 ml per minute). The primary end point was a doubling of the base-line serum creatine concentration or the need for dialysis.",

The reduction in risk was greatest among the male patients; those with glomerular diseases, diabetic nephropathy, or miscellaneous or unknown causes of renal disease; and those with base-line urinary protein excretion above 1 g per 24 hours.

    "356": "To determine whether lysylbradykinin (LBK, kallidin) causes bronchoconstriction in animals and if peptidase inhibitors modulate the response, we studied the effects of LBK administered by aerosol in rats and assessed whether pretreatment with aerosolized solutions of enalaprilat, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), or phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11 (EP 24.11, neutral endopeptidase), altered the response. Accordingly, LBK-induced bronchoconstriction was measured in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, specific pathogen-free, Sprague-Dawley rats by body plethysmography and followed by continuous determination of lung resistance (RL) and maximal expiratory flow (MEF). Incremental doses of aerosolized LBK were administered by nebulization to obtain a concentration that caused a 5-15% increase in RL, which was designated the BC10 dose. We found that pretreatment with aerosolized enalaprilat (1 mM) 3 min prior to a BC10 dose of LBK significantly increased RL as compared to the BC10 dose alone (129 +/- 4.1% vs. 105 +/- 2.4%, P < 0.002, n = 4) and significantly decreased MEF (83 +/- 1.5% vs. 97 +/- 1.4%, P < 0.008, n = 4). Following pretreatment with aerosolized phosphoramidon (1 mM), significant increases in RL (113 +/- 1.4% vs. 106 +/- 1.6%, P < 0.019, n = 7) and decreases in MEF (92 +/- 0.9% vs. 95 +/- 0.9%, P < 0.035, n = 7) were observed (paired Student's t-test). The above findings demonstrate the effects of LBK on airway caliber for the first time in an animal model, and suggest that ACE and EP 24.11 contribute to degradation of the peptide in the airway.", 
    "357": "The advent of the ACE inhibitors has been one of the major developments in cardiovascular pharmacology this century. Aside from their role as potent anti-hypertensive drugs with few adverse effects, ACE inhibitors have numerous other effects that have only been partially explained. Antihypertensive therapy is the most effective treatment in patients with diabetic nephropathy, postponing the development of end-stage renal failure. Although this effect can apparently be obtained with all antihypertensives (except nifedipine), recent meta-analyses have indicated that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on proteinuria and preserved renal function are greater than with other drugs. In nondiabetic patients, treatment with ACE inhibitors may delay or prevent the development of congestive heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Whether this also occurs in diabetic patients is still unknown, but subgroup analysis of existing studies and controlled clinical trials in this area should be encouraged. In conclusion, ACE inhibitors are the only drugs that have been proven, in controlled clinical trials, to be effective in preventing progression from micro-albuminuria to overt nephropathy. Furthermore, they are more effective in diminishing albuminuria at low levels of blood pressure reduction compared with other antihypertensives. In comparison with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors have the advantage that they do not mask the subjective symptoms of hypoglycaemia, nor do they affect the serum lipid profile.", 
    "358": "An assay that measures the total, and protein-bound captopril, the orally active antihypertensive drug, in whole human blood and urine has been developed. The procedure involves a precolumn derivatization of the drug via its sulfhydryl group with 1-benzyl-2-chloropyridinium bromide followed by solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography separation with ultraviolet detection at 314 nm. Oxidized and protein-bound captopril is converted to reduced form by the use of triphenylphosphine and derivatized and quantified in the same manner. The proposed method offers the possibility of determining the in vivo redox status of captopril in blood of patients orally given a standard dose of at least 12.5 mg of captopril as part of the treatment of hypertensive disease and/or congestive heart failure. In the recommended procedure the sulfhydryl form of captopril is trapped with minimal oxidation by derivatizing blood samples at the time of collection. This is attained by drawing blood directly into tubes containing solutions of 1-benzyl-2-chloropyridinium bromide. The method enables also the determination of urinary excretion of captopril and its disulphides after oral administration of the drug. Accurate determinations are possible over a concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/ml captopril in blood, 50 to 1200 ng/ml captopril in urine and 10 to 1000 ng/ml captopril disulphide and 50 to 3000 ng/ml captopril disulphide in blood and urine, respectively. The detection and quantification limits for both blood and urine are 0.3 and 10 ng/ml, respectively.",

    "360": "The current study was performed to determine whether baroreflex resetting after acute administration of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) was dependent on the concomitant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Reflex changes in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (LSNA) due to increases and decreases in MAP [i.v. phenylephrine (PE) and nitroprusside infusions] were determined in normotensive and renal hypertensive (1-kidney, 1-clip) anesthetized WKY rats 1) before (control), 2) 15 min after intravenous captopril (2 mg/kg) or enalaprilat (300 micrograms), and 3) 15 min after MAP was returned to pre-CEI levels with intravenous PE. CEIs decreased MAP and caused a leftward shift of the MAP-LSNA curve toward a lower operating pressure range in all hypertensive and in one group of normotensive rats. The baroreflex curve remained shifted to the left even after MAP was restored to pre-CEI levels by infusion of PE. Thus CEIs cause a pressure-independent resetting of baroreflex control of sympathetic outflow within 15 min. This effect of CEIs is most likely due to elimination of a central nervous system effect of circulating angiotensin II and could contribute to the antihypertensive actions of this class of compounds.", 
    "361": "The present study was performed in seven healthy subjects (aged 22-35 years) to investigate 1) whether plasma and urinary endothelin-1 (ET-1) are involved in the response to postural changes and 2) the relationship between ET-1 formation and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Six hours of standing caused a prompt but very short-lasting increase in plasma ET-1 concentration (59% after 5 min, 12% after 1 h) and a notable and sustained enhancement of urinary ET-1 excretion (from 0.59 +/- 0.10 to 1.43 +/- 0.28 pg/min, or 142%; P < 0.001). Plasma renin activity increased by 169% after 1 h of standing. A parallel contraction of urinary volume (-62%), sodium excretion (-55%), and free water reabsorption (-24%) occurred. The return to the supine position after 6 h of orthostasis caused a reduction to baseline values of the ET-1 urinary excretion and urinary volume within 2 h. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme blunted, but did not eliminate, the orthostasis-induced increase in ET-1 urinary excretion (100%, P < 0.002) and changes in the renal functions. The present results indicate that renal ET-1 is involved in the hemodynamic long-lasting responses to postural changes and that its increase is partially controlled by RAS and suggest that ET-1 might play a role in the regulation of renal function in humans.", 
    "362": "Responses to angiotensin I-(3-10), the precursor for angiotensin IV, were investigated in the anesthetized cat. Intravenous injections of the precursor caused dose-related increases in systemic arterial pressure that were similar to responses elicited by angiotensin i.v. and that were inhibited by captopril. in the hindlimb vascular bed of the cat under constant-flow conditions, injections of the substrate into the perfusion circuit in doses of 3-100 micrograms caused dose-related increases in hindlimb perfusion pressure that were rapid in onset and were not altered by the presence of a time-delay coil in the perfusion circuit. Dose-response curves for the precursor and angiotensin i.v. were parallel, and the precursor was approximately twofold less potent than angiotensin i.v. in its ability to increase hindlimb perfusion pressure. Responses to the precursor were inhibited by captopril in a dose that attenuated hindlimb vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin I. Increases in hindlimb perfusion pressure in response to angiotensin I-(3-10) were inhibited by DuP-532 in a dose that attenuated the response to angiotensin i.v. PD-123,319, an AT2 receptor antagonist, had no significant effect on responses to angiotensin I-(3-10). The present results suggest that angiotensin I-(3-10) is rapidly and efficiently converted by an angiotensin converting enzyme-dependent pathway into an active peptide, which induces vasoconstriction by activating AT1 receptors in the peripheral vascular bed of the cat.",

    "364": "Renin-angiotensin system plays a prominent role in the sodium and water homeostasis. In addition, activation of renin-angiotensin system frequently occurs in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Theoretically, administering of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can enhance sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites. In this study, we evaluate the role of low-dose captopril on renal function changes, renal plasma flow and hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Fifty patients are randomly assigned to receive captopril or placebo for 14 days. Renal functions, renal plasma flow, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics are measured before and after treatment. Our results indicate that placebo administration did not affect any of the parameter measured in this study. The finding that low-dose captopril significantly increases plasma renin activity suggests that the dose used in this study effectively blocks the enzyme activity. However, low-dose captopril does not affect renal plasma flow, renal functions and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics. Results in this study demonstrate that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme alone may not improve sodium and water retention in cirrhotic patients with ascites.",

The H.E.L.P. apheresis system is the most potent technique to reduce at the same time LDL, lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]), and fibrinogen plasma concentrations if the physiological clearing mechanisms are insufficient and if diet and drugs fail to achieve a target concentration of 100 mg/dl LDL-cholesterol or lower, required for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. The H.E.L.P. LDL apheresis system also improves plasma viscosity and microcirculation efficiently. The clinical experience with the H.E.L.P. system has proved its clinical utility; regression of coronary heart disease occurs, a decrease in events of coronary heart disease takes place, and acute as well as chronic impairment of microcirculation shows a remarkable improvement with H.E.L.P. therapy. For the future, the availability of this safe and efficient apheresis technique may help many patients who previously could not be treated adequately.", 
    "366": "The pharmacokinetic interaction between cefdinir and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril or quinapril) was investigated in rats. The linearity of cefdinir pharmacokinetics was demonstrated in three groups of rats receiving 10, 20, or 40 mg of cefdinir per kg of body weight intravenously. Then, three other groups of rats were established as follows: group 1 (n = 5) received cefdinir (10 mg/kg) intravenously, and 12 blood samples per rat were drawn between 0 and 8 h after injection of the dose; group 2 (n = 5) was treated in the same way as group 1, but captopril (0.8 mg/kg) was coadministered by intraintestinal injection into all animals; group 3 (n = 6) was treated in the same way as group 2, but quinapril (0.8 mg/kg) replaced captopril. Plasma cefdinir concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography, and the data were analyzed by a noncompartmental method. Finally, three groups of four or five rats each were set up as described above, but the cefdinir dose was 20 mg/kg and the animals were sacrificed 1 h after drug injection to collect blood to determine the unbound cefdinir fraction (fu) by ultrafiltration. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased the mean cefdinir area under the concentration-time curve up to 8 h by a factor of 1.8 (captopril; P < 0.05) and a factor of 3.5 (quinapril; P < 0.05). With captopril, mean cefdinir clearance was decreased by a factor of 2, and the volume of distribution increased by the same factor, while the fu increased from 15.4% +/- 3.0% (cefdinir alone) to 22.8% +/- 10.9% (cefdinir plus captopril). Captopril increased the cefdinir half-life from 0.62 +/- 0.17 to 2.92 +/- 0.95 h. With quinapril, the interaction was so strong that no elimination phase was detectable in four of the six rats, and therefore, no pharmacokinetic parameter values other than the cefdinir fu could be calculated; the cefdinir fu increased to 25.1% +/- 11.1%. It is concluded that captopril and quinapril (and/or their metabolites) have a major impact on the disposition of cefdinir in rats, probably by competition at the plasma protein-binding level and at the tubular anionic carrier level. This latter mechanism should also be relevant in humans.", 
    "367": "We compared the consequences of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with quinapril and of specific AT1 blockade with losartan in a renin-dependent model of hypertension, the (mRen2)27 transgenic rats (TG). Animals were orally treated with 10 mg/kg/24 h of either quinapril (TGQ, n = 13) or losartan (TGL, n = 12) from age 4 to age 9 weeks. Indirect systolic blood pressure (SBP), and sodium and water balances were measured for 3 consecutive weeks. Nine-week-old rats were instrumented to record aortic BP in the conscious state. In addition, they received an infusion of glucose and saline to increase their diuresis and thus allow accurate assessment of their renal excretion during short time periods. These rats were studied for three one-h periods: (a) baseline, (b) after the administration of a bradykinin (BK) antagonist, and (c) after a cross-treatment; i.e., TGQ rats receiving losartan (10 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) and TGL rats receiving quinapril (10 mg/kg i.v.). TGL rats differed from TGQ rats by an unconsistently lower indirect SBP associated with significantly lower urinary volume and sodium excretion, whereas the sodium balance did not differ between the two groups. In conditions of fixed sodium intake the aortic BP of TGQ rats was still nonsignificantly different from that of TGL rats, and TGQ rats also exhibited two-fold higher natriuresis. The BK antagonist had no effect in either group, whereas losartan decreased the BP of TGQ rats. We conclude that in TG rats ACE inhibition is associated with an increased natriuresis as compared with specific AT1 blockade, an effect that is independent of the sodium intake. Because a BK antagonist had no effect, such a difference might be due to an antinatriuretic effect of AT2 receptors in chronic conditions.",

The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (IC50) of the thermolysin digest of total alpha-zein was 24.5 micrograms/ml, and most of the peptide fractions from Z19 alpha-zein and total alpha-zein separated by reverse-phase HPLC had more or less ACE inhibitory activity. From these fractions, thirty-six peptides, including 5 dipeptides, 14 tripeptides, 9 tetrapeptides, 5 pentapeptides, and 3 hexapeptides, were purified and their amino acid sequences were determined.",

    "370": "Fourteen hypertensive patients being treated with nifedipine and having an interventricular septum thickness of more than 12 mm were studied. Half of them were given 5 mg lisinopril, and the others were not. Short-axis images of the left ventricle from the base to the apex were obtained by a standard spin-echo pulse sequence. The entire LV mass was calculated from the area of short-axis slices of the left ventricle multiplied by slice thickness.",

    "373": "There will always be birth defects and pregnancy complications due to factors beyond our control. However, we are rapidly discovering many interventions women can use to optimize their chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby. Most of these, such as immunization and normalization of a diabetic woman's glycosylated hemoglobin level, are most effective when begun before conception. Since the discovery of the congenital rubella syndrome in 1941, there has been a steady accumulation of information on the prevention of birth defects through preconception health. In just the last few years, we have learned that folic acid can decrease neural tube defects, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are teratogenic, and zidovudine can decrease the vertical transmission rate of human immunodeficiency virus. The Varivax vaccine released last year is expected to decrease the perinatal morbidity from varicella. By using the time before conception, we may be able to fully maximize the benefits of good nutrition, exercise, medical screening, and avoidance of environmental toxins.", 
    "374": "Effective treatment of heart failure depends on a correct functional and aetiological diagnosis. In asymptomatic patients with cardiac dysfunction following myocardial infarction, treatment is directed to prevent recurrent infarction by aggressive lipid lowering with statins and antiplatelet drugs. Beta blockers are important to reduce sudden death. In symptomatic heart failure, clinical improvement is obtained by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in combination with diuretics reduce morbidity and mortality caused by progression of the myocardial dysfunction and recurrent myocardial infarction. Drugs that activate the neurohormonal systems are clearly counteractive. Digitalis has a definite favourable effect on systems, and in patients with atrial fibrillation, but its effect on mortality is still unsettled. Beta blockers in routine treatment of symptomatic heart failure still remains controversial, but may benefit selected patients.", 
    "375": "We review current knowledge on the true size of the clinical condition known as 'heart failure' in terms of epidemiological information and in relation to the true clinical burden. Population studies, together with data from physician and general practitioner records, reveal a range of estimated heart-failure prevalence of 1-10%. Estimated incidence rates vary from approximately 0-1% per annum. Reasons for variation include age, sex and, possibly, methodology. In community studies, the five-year mortality is between 50-60% while, in patients requiring hospital admission, the annual mortality is 10-20% in those with mild-moderate symptoms, and as high as 40-60% in severe heart failure. While angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment does significantly improve mortality in all grades of symptomatic heart failure, the annual mortality in severe patients was still 36% in CONSENSUS I. It is obvious that the term 'heart failure' is insufficiently descriptive or specific to be an acceptable label for all patients who might benefit from treatment. As 'clinical' heart failure is often an advanced and irreversible state, studies of its antecedents are important in developing strategies aimed at retarding the progression from the asymptomatic to the symptomatic conditions. The true prevalence of the most common antecedent, left ventricular dysfunction, has received relatively little attention.",

    "379": "Seventy-two non-diabetic hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either carvedilol or metoprolol. An isoglycemic, hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp was conducted before and after 12 weeks of treatment; the metabolic clearance rate for glucose was taken as an indicator of insulin sensitivity.", 
    "380": "The two groups did not differ in age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure or lipids, and treatment effectively lowered blood pressure. In both groups, insulin sensitivity was impaired at baseline. After metoprolol treatment, insulin sensitivity further decreased significantly by about 14%, whereas it increased after carvedilol. There was also a decrease in high-density lipoprotein and an increase in triglycerides levels in patients in the metoprolol-treated group, whereas these parameters remained unchanged in patients in the carvedilol-treated group.", 
    "381": "This study confirms previous findings of a reduction in insulin sensitivity after chronic metoprolol treatment. Carvedilol treatment, however, resulted in a small amelioration of insulin resistance and a better lipid profile [corrected]. We thus demonstrate that a beta-blocker with alpha 1-blocking properties has favorable effects on glucose metabolism, suggesting a potentially important role of peripheral blood flow in regulating glucose uptake. These findings imply that beta-blocker treatment, when combined with alpha 1-blocking activity has advantageous effects on insulin sensitivity and lipids and could therefore be suitable for patients with the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "382": "In 1992, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, RAND assembled an expert panel to develop the Heart Failure Clinical Practice Guideline.

Substantial progress was made in identifying recommendations that panelists and reviewers were willing to endorse in utilization review activities, including adoption of improved documentation standards. The review criteria's major impact may be the knowledge that the criteria are in place and that care is being monitored based on those standards.", 
    "385": "Detection, treatment and control of hypertension is one of the best proven approaches to prevention of cardiovascular disease. Antihypertensive treatment trials have convincingly demonstrated that diuretics and beta-blockers reduce the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. Corresponding information is not yet available for newer classes of antihypertensive drug therapy such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha 1 receptor blockers. Several experimental studies are now addressing this question. The largest such trial (n = 40,000) is the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). This manuscript describes two studies (TOMHS and the VA study on antihypertensive agents) that compared several classes of antihypertensive drugs with regard to blood pressure outcomes and ALLHAT, which is comparing the effect of four first-step approaches to antihypertensive therapy on combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction.", 
    "386": "Dysfunction of the left ventricle may result from a variety of insults, all of which may initiate a self-perpetuating process of ventricular remodeling which may progress to end-stage heart disease. Symptoms of heart failure may or may not co-exist with this ventricular remodeling. Treatment and prevention of these two largely distinct entities differ. Symptoms may respond to diuretics, vasodilators and digoxin. Progressive ventricular remodeling may be slowed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate and beta blockers. Prevention of symptomatic heart failure is dependent on early recognition of ventricular dysfunction and aggressive treatment to slow its progression. Development of more effective and targeted therapies will be dependent on expanded insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to the remodeling process.", 
    "387": "The prevention of coronary artery disease (CHD) and particularly of myocardial infarction (MI) is based on some well designed strategies aimed at treating both asymptomatic high-risk patients (primary prevention) and patients with established CHD (secondary prevention). A positive impact from primary prevention can be basically achieved trough a reduction in high blood pressure and by correcting dyslipidemia. The benefit can be substantially increased by smoking cessation, increasing physical exercise, reduction of body weight, use of post-menopausal oestrogen, moderate alcohol consumption and use of high doses of vitamin E in those patients who are compliant with the specific strategies. Secondary prevention of MI can be again obtained by controlling blood pressure and reducing serum cholesterol in patients surviving acute MI who can also benefit from the administration of beta-blockers, aspirin and probably ace-inhibitors particularly in presence of left ventricular dysfunction. We suggest that in both arms of prevention, significant results can be achieved mainly by a multifactorial approach capable of correcting all the modifiable risk factors that contribute to the rather complex pathogenesis of CHD.", 
    "388": "The issue as to whether antihypertensive drugs may exert some antiatherosclerotic effect, at least partly independent of blood pressure lowering, has been explored in several experimental models of atherosclerosis, and a large body of evidence has been obtained in favor of a specific antiatherosclerotic action of calcium antagonists and ACE-inhibitors. On the clinical side, several studies are investigating the problem in hypertensive patients in whom progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and atherosclerotic plaques is explored by sensitive quantitative B-mode ultrasound techniques. The MIDAS has indicated a slower progression, at least in the first six months, of carotid plaques in isradipine treated patients than in diuretic-treated ones. However, MIDAS as a pioneer study has been particularly valuable in giving information on the rate of growth of IMT in hypertensive patients and on the best end-point to use in carotid ultrasound trials. Baseline data of the ongoing studies ELSA and VHAS have so far provided evidence of the very high prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis among hypertensive patients, an observation that makes the evaluation of the antiatherosclerotic action of some antihypertensive agents even more important. Finally, the PHYLLIS trial using a factorial design, beside exploring the antiatherosclerotic action of an ACE-inhibitor vs a diuretic, intends to evaluate the possible benefits of associating antihypertensive therapy with lipid lowering by a statin on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis.", 
    "389": "Drug treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics in hypertensive men and women aged 70 and above confers highly significant and clinically relevant reductions in cardiovascular (especially stroke) morbidity and mortality. This satisfactory effect is not impaired by a low tolerability of the drugs used. Furthermore, treatment of elderly hypertensives with beta-receptor blockers and/or diuretics is cost-effective. In STOP-Hypertension the cost-effectiveness ratios were low and of the same magnitude for both men and women. The clinical implication of this is that blood pressure lowering therapy should be considered in elderly hypertensives, at least up until they are 80 years old. It should also be remembered that elderly patients often have other diseases than hypertension and that the drug treatment should be adjusted accordingly, e.g. by using a calcium antagonist or an ACE inhibitor, when indicated.",

They followed an unrestricted diet and received a single oral daily dose of 4 mg perindopril (ACE inhibitor) for 6 weeks. Plasma renin activity increased significantly and plasma aldosterone decreased significantly after perindopril treatment, suggesting that an effective blockade of angiotensin II formation was accomplished. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased. Urinary bicycloprostaglandin E2 (an inactive metabolite of prostaglandin E2) increased significantly, while plasma and urinary kallikrein activity decreased significantly after perindopril treatment. The results obtained demonstrated significant changes in prostaglandin E2 and kallikrein activity during ACE inhibition. The contributive role of these humoral factors in the hypotensive effect of perindopril are discussed.",

    "396": "Heart failure constitutes an increasing health hazard with major demands on health care resources. Recent major advances in drug treatment have yet to be translated into increased survival of heart failure patients in the community at large. Failure of diagnosis is a major factor in delaying early and adequate treatment. Echocardiography probably provides the most reliable and inexpensive instrument to confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the mechanical components of the syndrome. The targets for therapeutic intervention may be categorized (i) haemodynamic, neuroendocrine and metabolic disorders (ii) symptoms and quality of life, (iii) morbidity and mortality risks. Symptoms and quality of life are the prime concerns of the physician in the treatment in the individual patient. Selection of anti-heart failure drugs used should be based on knowledge of the impact on the pathophysiological disorders and on the morbidity and mortality risks. Diuretics, vasodilators and ACE-inhibitors are now accepted as standard treatment, particularly when used in combination. Controversy continues to surround the efficacy of digitalis glycosides; they improve symptoms in some patients but their impact on morbidity and mortality risks is still uncertain. Even with standard treatments, may practical therapeutic questions remain, one of which is what is the most efficacious dose of each anti-heart failure drug which, when used in combination, will give the maximum improvement in quality of life and greatest extension of survival? Despite available treatment with diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators and ACE-inhibitors, the morbidity and mortality risks of congestive heart failure remain high. None of these drug groups significantly modulates the excessive excitation of the sympathoadrenal system, one of the two major neuroendocrine hazards of heart failure. For this reason, amongst the many newer drugs in development, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists hold considerable promise as the next step towards a more comprehensive treatment of congestive heart failure.",

    "408": "The present study describes a novel renal hypertensive guinea pig model for comparing different inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Renal hypertension was induced by a two-step procedure consisting of ligation of the left caudal renal artery and right nephrectomy. Sham-operated animals were used as controls. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored in conscious animals. Left caudal renal artery ligation and subsequent right nephrectomy led to a significant increase (32% over sham-operated controls, p < .05) in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), 3 to 4 weeks following surgery. Renal hypertensive animals had increased urine production (from 63 +/- 8 mL/kg per day to 143 +/- 29 mL/kg per day, p < .05) and an increased incidence of proteinuria (11/13 animals had urine protein levels higher than 20 mg/kg per day). Five of the 13 renal hypertensive animals also had hematuria. On autopsy, an 83% increase in the left kidney/body weight ratio and a 37% increase in the heart/body weight ratio were observed in the renal hypertensive animals, compared to the sham-operated controls. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate were assessed before and after an intravenous bolus injection of the drug to be tested. Captopril reduced MABP in both sham-operated and renal hypertensive animals with equal efficacy (up to a maximum of 42%). In contrast, BILA 2157 BS, one of our human renin inhibitors, produced a similar maximum MABP decrease but only in renal hypertensive animals. This selective antihypertensive effect was also observed with enalkiren, another renin inhibitor. These results indicate that the renal hypertensive guinea pig is an useful model for comparing and contrasting different RAS inhibitors.", 
    "409": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on bronchial responsiveness has not been clearly established. Because ACE degrades bradykinin and substance P, inhibition of the enzyme may lead to accumulation of these potent bronchoconstrictors in the lung, potentially leading to enhanced bronchial reactivity or bronchospasm. Previous studies of the effect of ACE inhibition on airway responsiveness have yielded conflicting results. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was therefore conducted to evaluate the effect of a 14-day course of oral lisinopril (10 mg for days 1-3, 20 mg for days 4-14) on bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in a group of healthy volunteers. No significant change in methacholine responsiveness occurred in any of the participants receiving lisinopril. The mean ( +/- SD) concentration of methacholine producing a decrease in FEV1 of 20% from baseline (PC20; mg/mL) was 23.3 +/- 5.0 before the study and 23.5 +/- 4.5 at the end of the study for the lisinopril group, and 23.0 +/- 4.6 before the study and 21.8 +/- 6.9 after the study for the placebo group.

The DNA damage was measured by fluorometric alkaline elution. The strand scission factor, an index of the severity of SSB, increased slightly after stimulation with 200 microMs NE for 12 hours and with 1 mM NE for 4 hours. This increase was prevented by catalase or superoxide dismutase, which prevent production or accumulation of active oxygen radicals, during the stimulation, but not by pretreatment with a alpha-receptor antagonist, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a Ca2+ antagonist, or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus, DNA SSB were induced by NE in cardiac myoblast cells. Certain active oxygen species may contribute to the DNA damage induced by NE.",

The antibody used had less than 0.1% cross-reactivity with angiotensin I. ACE activity increased 1.9-fold 5 hr after the addition of 10(-6) M ET under serum-free conditions. This stimulatory effect of ET on ACE activity in VSMCs was completely inhibited by 10(-7) M captopril. Results suggested that the ACE present in SMCs is stimulated by ET.",

Thus, either constitutive mRNA may be confidently used to index structural or functional protein responses, at the transcriptional level, in the SHR.", 
    "413": "In asymptomatic essential hypertensive patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and without left ventricular hypertrophy, dipyridamole-induced ischemic-like ST segment depression may be a marker of coronary microvascular disease. In this study we evaluated, first, whether this cardiac abnormality is linked to structural or functional vascular abnormalities, and second, the effect of antihypertensive treatment by 12-month administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (50 mg twice a day orally). In essential hypertensives with dipypridamole echocardiography stress test (DET) (DET+, n = 8) and without (DET-, n = 8) ST segment depression greater than 0.1 mV during intravenous dipyridamole infusion (0.84 mg/kg over 10 min), we studied the forearm blood flow (FBF, venous plethysmography, mL/100) modifications induced by intrabrachial acetylcholine (Ach) (0.15, 0.45, 1.5, 4.5, 15 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 min each), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1, 2, 4 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 min each), a smooth muscle cell relaxant compound. Minimal forearm vascular resistances (MFVR), an index of arteriolar structural changes, were also calculated. Both Ach and SNP caused greater vasodilation in DET- as compared to DET+ while MFVRs were lower in DET- compared to DET+. After treatment, both DET+ and DET- patients showed a significant and similar reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, while vasodilation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside was increased only in the DET+ group. In addition, forearm minimal vascular resistances were significantly reduced only in DET+ patients, who showed disappearance of dipyridamole-induced ischemic-like ST segment depression. In conclusion, these data confirm that essential hypertensive patients with microvascular coronary disease are characterized by the presence of structural changes in the forearm vascular bed. Our results also indicate that both cardiac and forearm vascular abnormalities can be reversed by antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "414": "In a previous open study on the metabolic effects of doxazosin in patients with essential hypertension, subgroup analysis indicated that subjects with an accumulation of risk factors for coronary heart disease (high VLDL triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high fasting blood glucose) seemed to benefit most from the metabolic actions of doxazosin treatment. Those results formed the basis of this double-blind, parallel-group study undertaken to elucidate the metabolic effects of 6 months of doxazosin and enalapril treatment in patients with both essential hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin sensitivity was measured with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method. Hemodynamic evaluation included measurements of office and ambulatory blood pressure and ultrasonic measurements of femoral artery blood flow. Both drugs significantly reduced both office BP and 24-h ambulatory BP. Office systolic BP was significantly better reduced by enalapril. Doxazosin, in contrast to enalapril, significantly increased insulin sensitivity (by 21%, P = .02). It also reduced serum-triglycerides (by 23%, P = .01), VLDL triglycerides (by 30%, P = .008) and VLDL cholesterol (by 24%, P = .02). This lipid-lowering effect of doxazosin was accompanied by an increase in both plasma lipoprotein lipase activity and the elimination rate of an intravenous fat emulsion load. Neither treatment significantly increased femoral artery blood flow. It is speculated that without measurably increasing blood flow in conduit vessels such as the femoral artery, doxazosin, by capillary recruitment, may prolong the transit time for the blood over the muscle bed, which could explain the increased glucose disposal and increased lipoprotein lipase activity.", 
    "415": "Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was used to assess the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril (Fos) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in doses of 10/12.5 mg and 20/12.5 mg taken once daily versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. In two methodologically identical studies, the antihypertensive effects were evaluated by 24-h ABPM and by seated office diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressures. After a 4- or 5-week placebo washout, 79 patients received randomized, double-blind treatment for 8 weeks with either the Fos/HCTZ 10/12.5-mg dose combination (n = 41) or placebo (n = 38), and in the second study, 62 patients were treated with either the Fos/HCTZ 20/12.5-mg dose combination (n = 30) or placebo (n = 32). Changes from baseline in mean 24-h systolic and diastolic ABPM were significantly different from placebo for both doses (SBP/DBP with 10/12.5 mg, -18.2/ -10.1 mm Hg, P <or= .001; SBP/DBP with 20/12.5 mg, -22.9/ -11.2 mm Hg, P <or= .001); whereas ambulatory SBP and DBP in the placebo group were virtually unchanged. Although the antihypertensive effect of the higher Fos/HCTZ dose combination (20/12.5 mg) appeared greater than the lower dose (10/12.5 mg), no attempt was made to make a comparison between the two doses over these two independent studies. This difference in blood pressure lowering was not reproduced by the office blood pressure readings. Both dose combinations of Fos/HCTZ produced significantly greater reductions in the office seated DBP than placebo at all time points tested with a maximum treatment effect (drug effect - placebo effect) of -7.3 mm Hg for the 10/12.5-mg dose and -8.2 mm Hg for the 20/12.5-mg dose after 8 weeks of therapy (P <or= .01). Based on the results obtained in these trials, both dose combinations of Fos/HCTZ taken once daily were safe and effective in the management of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ABPM detected what appears to be an enhanced blood pressure reduction with the higher Fos/HCTZ dose combination (20/12.5 mg) at peak and trough, which was not reproduced by trough office blood pressure measurements, suggesting greater sensitivity of 24-h ABPM for evaluating antihypertensive effects.", 
    "416": "Patients with hypertension have a characteristic circadian pattern of blood pressure (BP) variability in a 24-h period, characterized by a wide range while awake and active, and a narrower range during sleep and inactivity. Blood pressure in the untreated hypertensive individual declines by approximately 10% to 20% during sleep compared with the mean awake BP values. Early in the morning (assuming a typical day-night activity cycle), the BP rises sharply on awakening, when physical and mental activities increase. Antihypertensive therapy has been traditionally dosed in the morning after awakening, and in recent years most of the newly developed antihypertensive agents have been once-daily, long-acting preparations. However, theoretically, this pattern of drug dosing may be suboptimal since pharmacodynamic activity is attenuated at the end of the dosing period, when a large rise in BP may occur. Presently, only a few studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of nocturnal dosing of standard long-acting drugs. Consequently, we undertook an assessment of the effects of a new formulation of verapamil--controlled onset extended release verapamil HCl (COER-24)--that is dosed nocturnally and has a controlled onset of delivery (4 to 5 h postdose) and an extended release for the remainder of the dosing period. Through ambulatory BP monitoring, evaluation revealed that this verapamil formulation produced changes in BP that followed the circadian rhythm of BP: lower reductions during sleep, when the BP is intrinsically lowest, and appropriately larger reductions during the early morning and daytime hours, when ambulatory BP values accelerate and plateau to their highest levels. These data demonstrate that it is possible to design antihypertensive therapy for once-nightly dosing, thereby providing a chronotherapeutic regimen for patients with hypertension.", 
    "417": "Congestive heart failure is a clinical syndrome producing symptomatic deterioration, functional impairment, and shortened life span. The syndrome is complex in that it includes both peripheral and cardiac effects which contribute to the progression of heart failure. In the periphery, elevations in the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system increase afterload and contribute to further salt and water retention. The central cardiac abnormalities include remodeling of the heart and downregulation of beta receptors. Traditional heart failure therapy has included treatment of fluid retention with diuretics, although their effect on mortality has never been addressed. The most proven therapy in heart failure is treatment with vasodilators, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Improved survival with ACE-inhibitor therapy has been demonstrated in patients with severe heart failure (CONSENSUS), mild to moderate heart failure (SOLVD), and in comparison with vasodilator therapy with hydralazine isosorbide dinitrate (VHeFT II). Improved survival has also been noted in postmyocardial infarction when the ejection fraction is decreased (SAVE). The ACE inhibitors have now become standard therapy for heart failure regardless of severity. Additive vasodilator therapy with calcium-channel antagonists is under investigation. Inotropic therapy is controversial at present because of disappointing mortality results. The clinical mainstay digitalis remains without convincing mortality reduction data. Other inotropic agents, particularly phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have shown uniformly negative survival results. However, the new mixed action agents vesnarinone and pimobenden have shown favorable data, with vesnarinone demonstrating a mortality reduction effect. Beta-blocker therapy in heart failure has also found renewed interest, particularly with the new agents carvedolol and bucindolol which also have vasodilating properties.", 
    "418": "This report describes five infants (3 male, 2 female) with renal artery stenosis diagnosed in their 1st year of life. The age at initial presentation was 5 days to 10 months. All had symptoms of congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. Renograms were abnormal in four of the five infants. An intravenous pyelogram was obtained in three infants and was abnormal in two. Renal ultrasounds were obtained in two infants and were normal in both. Patients were treated for 4.4 +/- 0.9 years with antihypertensive drug therapy until surgical correction of the renal artery stenosis. Blood pressure was persistently elevated above the 95th percentile in four of the infants during the course of antihypertensive therapy prior to surgery. Patients have been followed for 9.4 +/- 2 years since surgery. The blood pressure of four patients is normal, and the blood pressure of the oldest patient (age 23 years) is borderline hypertensive. These data show that infants with renal artery stenosis can be cared for successfully with long-term antihypertensive drug therapy to preserve renal mass with minimal chronic adverse effects.", 
    "419": "Angiotensin formed in the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the genesis and development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. It has a negative impact on the process of ischaemization/reperfusion. The renin-angiotensin system is activated during a new myocardial infarction and has an impact on the process of remodelling of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction which causes its dysfunction and heart failure. ACE inhibitors are one of the important means which influence the formation of angiotensin II and thus prevent its action on heart and vessels. They prevent the development of atherosclerosis, reduce the extent of necroses during myocardial infarction and reduce the extent of left ventricular dysfunction. They diminish also stunning of the heart muscle during ischaemia/reperfusion and significantly prolong the patients life after infarction. They do not influence the development of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. ACE inhibitors have a positive effect on heart failure, they reduce the rate of reinfarctions and the mortality rate.", 
    "420": "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is driven by increased levels of angiotensin II (Ang II). In this study, we examined the time course of the fibrotic process in rats with UUO and explored the effect of delayed administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on the tubulo-interstitial fibrosis of obstructive uropathy. Rats were sacrificed at 3, 5, 8, or 10 days after UUO was initiated. Some rats did not receive treatment, whereas others were treated with enalapril from day 4 to day 8 or from day 6 to day 10 after the onset of UUO. The levels of mRNA for transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), collagen type IV (collagen IV), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) were measured at each time point by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relative volume of the tubulointerstitium (Vv) was measured by a point-counting method. Monocyte/macrophage infiltration and collagen IV protein deposition were examined histologically using specific antibodies. There were significant increases in TGF-beta 1, TIMP-1, and collagen IV mRNAs in the obstructed kidney. Treatment with enalapril on day 4 through day 8 or on day 6 through day 10 significantly reduced the elevated mRNA levels of these compounds in the obstructed kidney. Histological studies showed augmented Vv, monocyte/macrophage infiltration, interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, and collagen IV protein deposition on days 3, 5, 8, or 10 of UUO; enalapril treatment from day 4 to 8 or from day 6 to 10 halted and to an extent reversed these increases. These data suggest that enalapril administration after several days of UUO is an effective means of preventing the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis of obstructive uropathy.", 
    "421": "Diabetic nephropathy is the third cause of renal failure after pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis. Lately, many efforts have been made for the early identification (on the silent stage) of patients with a high risk of developing this disease. On these initial stages, therapeutic attitude has changed very much, emphasizing nowadays the importance of glucose levels control, avoiding maintained conditions of hyperglycemia and maintaining blood pressure within the limits, by using the therapeutic store available, basically calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "422": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors delay progression of renal disease in different animal models of nephropathy. We tested this treatment modality in 70 hypertensive patients with severe renal disease of various etiologies. We report a double-blind study of the effect of 5 mg enalapril once daily compared with placebo in patients with nondiabetic severe chronic renal impairment (plasma creatinine 2.8 to 6.8 mg/dL; mean creatinine clearance 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) followed for up to 2 years. Efficacy parameters were the slopes of 51Cr-EDTA clearance, reciprocal of plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance, and the effect on urinary protein excretion. Thirty-one patients completed 2 years of treatment (12 in the enalapril group and 19 in the placebo group). Two patients died from nonrenal causes (one patient each in the enalapril and placebo groups), 16 patients commenced dialysis (seven in the enalapril group and nine in the placebo group), and eight patients were discontinued due to adverse events (five in the enalapril group and three in the placebo group). Eleven patients were discontinued because they were noncompliant, uncooperative, or moved (nine in the enalapril group and two in the placebo group). Two enalapril-treated patients were dropped from the study due to protocol deviations. Importantly, the statistical approach in this study evaluated all patients, regardless of the duration of treatment. A mixed-effects linear model and intention to treat analysis, taking into account the number of observations per patient, indicated that enalapril significantly reduced the rate of deterioration of renal disease: glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.038), reciprocal of plasma creatinine (P = 0.017), or creatinine clearance (P = 0.031). The renal protective effects of enalapril were shown to be in addition to its antihypertensive effect when blood pressure was held constant. Proteinuria was reduced by enalapril (P = 0.007) and was slightly increased in the placebo-treated patients (P = 0.051). The difference between these two groups was highly significant (P = 0.002). In conclusion, enalapril retarded the progression of chronic renal failure, as assessed by changes in glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, and 1/plasma creatinine, and reduced proteinuria in patients with nondiabetic severe chronic renal insufficiency.", 
    "423": "A case of thrombotic microangiopathy presenting as a hemolytic uremic syndrome complicated by untreatable hypertension and ultimately requiring bilateral nephrectomy is discussed. Severe hypertension and renal failure may complicate the course of vascular diseases of the kidney, including thrombotic microangiopathy, chronic hypertension, and scleroderma. Toxins, pressure stress, and immune material may trigger the initial injury to vascular endothelium. The malignant course of these renal vascular diseases seems linked to the severity of vascular injury. Endothelial injury manifests with swelling and detachment of endothelial cells from the basement membrane, expansion of the subendothelial space, and newly formed basement membrane-like material. In arterioles, endothelial injury precedes myointimal swelling and proliferation, leading to vascular lumina narrowing or obliteration and secondary glomerular ischemia, with glomerular tuft collapse and garland-like wrinkling and thickening of the capillary wall. Endothelial cell injury is very likely the common determinant of a cascade of events that lead to irreversible renal failure. When the initial insult (toxins, mechanical stress, antibodies) is promptly removed, lesions are self-limiting and the patient usually recovers. However, a severe insult persisting for some time can lead to chronic and irreversible vascular lesions that, through renal ischemia, trigger maximal activation of the renin angiotensin system with a brisk elevation in arterial blood pressure that may combine to further vascular injury and renal ischemia. Moreover, enhanced shear stress in the severely narrowed microcirculation, through abnormal von Willebrand factor processing, can also favor endothelial injury and platelet aggregation, which may further worsen the vascular lesions and sustain the microangiopathic process. Plasma manipulation, arteriolar vasodilators, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors normally control the vicious circle, but in few severe cases bilateral nephrectomy remains the last chance to save the patient's life.",

    "426": "37 (64%) of all questionnaires were returned and analysed. All centres used orally administered drugs for premedication in the evening before the operation. Flunitrazepam is the most often administered drug (54%), followed by dipotassium clorazepat (8%), and diazepam (8%). Premedication in the morning on the day of surgery is performed orally in 29 centres (78%), of which 18 centres (49%) prefer flunitrazepam and 6 centres (16%) midazolam as first choice. In contrast, 7 centres (19%) used intramuscularly administered regimens. 5 centres (14%) combined intramuscularly opioids with sedatives for that indication. If anaesthesia was induced late in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively, 11 centres (30%) administered additional benzodiazepines early in the morning. 68% of all centres maintained the administration of chronic treatment with ss-blockers until the morning of the operating day. Chronic treatment with nitrates is continued in 65%, treatment with calcium-channel blockers in 62%. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are continued in 30%, alpha 2-agonists in 27%, other antihypertensive drugs in 19%, and inotropic glycosids in 11%. 31 of 37 centres (84%) discontinued the administration of acetylsalicylic acid 5 or more days prior to surgery, but 68% tolerate individual exceptions from this principle.",

    "431": "Baseline values were identical in both groups except for mean arterial pressure which was slightly higher in the subjects subsequently receiving CsA + enalapril. Three month treatment with CsA increased significantly mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance by 9 and 24% respectively, while decreasing significantly glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow by 17 and 14% respectively. Enalapril was able to prevent the decline in GFR and the increase in blood pressure induced by CsA. This effect was demonstrated despite a similar increase in renal vascular resistance suggesting a dissociation between changes in glomerular filtration rate and renal vascular resistance during angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition.",

Whether these results can be extrapolated to transplant recipients in whom CsA is usually associated to treatment by glucocorticosteroids deserves further evaluation.", 
    "433": "In this study we investigated whether the increase in proteinuria induced by an oral protein load may be prevented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril in patients with nephrotic syndrome, and whether the effects of captopril on renal haemodynamics and/or glomerular selectivity are comparable to those obtained with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin and the calcium-channel blocker (CaCB) nifedipine.", 
    "434": "Twelve subjects underwent the following treatments: (1) low-protein meal (0.2 g protein/kg body wt), (2) high-protein meal (1.3 g protein/kg body wt), (3) high-protein meal plus oral captopril (50 mg), (4) high-protein meal plus oral nifedipine (10 mg), (5) high-protein meal plus oral indomethacin (50 mg). Urine and blood samples were obtained after meals and tested for total protein, immunoglobulin G and albumin. GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) were calculated from iothalamate and p-aminohippuric acid clearances respectively.", 
    "435": "Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly after both captopril (-4%, P = 0.001) and nifedipine (-5%, P = 0.0019). Compared with the low-protein meal, mean values of GFR and RPF increased significantly after the high-protein meal alone (+21%, P = 0.0002; +10%, P = 0.0491 respectively), and after captopril (+18%, P = 0.0025; +24%, P = 0.0034 respectively) or nifedipine administration (+30%, P = 0.0001; +21%, P = 0.0036 respectively), whereas they remained unchanged after the high-protein meal plus indomethacin administration. FF did not change significantly under the five experimental conditions. The increase in urinary protein excretion induced by the meat load (total protein +18%, P = 0.0102; albumin +26%, P = 0.0316; IgG +28%, P = 0.0203) was entirely blocked by both captopril and indomethacin, whereas it was further increased by nifedipine administration.", 
    "436": "Both captopril and indomethacin, but not nifedipine, are able to prevent the increase in urinary protein excretion rate following a meat meal. The antiproteinuric effect of captopril is comparable to that of indomethacin, but the renal haemodynamic changes induced by these drugs differ considerably, because the filtration capacity and the renal functional reserve were preserved by captopril and decreased by indomethacin. The reduction in systemic blood pressure following administration of both captopril and nifedipine does not account for changes in proteinuria, since, with a similar degree of blood pressure lowering, urinary protein excretion is reduced by captopril and increased by nifedipine.", 
    "437": "Although there have been many studies on the prognosis of congestive heart failure, most of them have not provided specific data about older patients.

In that year, 84 patients who fulfilled those criteria were admitted.", 
    "439": "The mean age was 72 +/- 6 years, 56% were male and 44% female. Age distribution was as follows: 36 patients were between 65 and 70 years, 27 between 70 and 75, 8 between 75 and 80, and 13 older than 80. The etiology of heart failure was: ischemic heart disease 44%, valvular heart disease 36%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 8%, systemic arterial hypertension 7% and other etiologies 5%. Significant systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.45) was present in 36% of the patients. Ten percent of the patients suffered from severe ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation). Regarding treatment, 24% underwent valvular surgery, 74% received only medical treatment and coronary angioplasty was performed in one patient. In hospital mortality was 9% (8 patients). After a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 4 months, the probability of survival was 78% at 1 month, 71% at 6 months and 63% at 1 year. The survival rate was better in patients with higher ejection fraction (53% for patients with ejection fractions of less than 0.45, 64% for those with ejection fractions between 0.45 and 0.60 and 79% for those with ejection fractions greater than 0.60). Considering etiology, the survival rate was worse for patients with acute myocardial infarction (30%) and aortic valve stenosis (58%).", 
    "440": "Patients older than 65 years admitted to the hospital for severe congestive heart failure represent a heterogeneous population in respect to etiology, systolic function and prognosis. Nevertheless, from this study it appears that a worse prognosis was associated with the lower left ventricular ejection fractions and with certain etiologies; such as acute myocardial infarction or aortic stenosis.", 
    "441": "The efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of heart disease is due in part to the accumulation of bradykinin (BK). Since BK can exert its effect by influencing cell proliferation, we chose to study the effect of BK on the growth of A10 vascular smooth muscle cells. Ligand binding studies to determine which BK receptor subtypes are present on A10 cells showed that both B1 and B2 receptors were present in approximately equal numbers. Examination of RNA synthesis demonstrated that BK inhibits uridine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner. This decrease in RNA synthesis was blocked by both B1 and B2 receptor antagonists, as well as by addition of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. The latter result suggested that prostaglandins mediate the biological actions of BK. Consequently, we examined the direct effect of two prostaglandins, PGE2 and PGI2 (prostacyclin), on A10 cells. PGE2 caused a decrease in RNA synthesis, thus mimicking the effect of BK, while PGI2 did not. Therefore, the inhibition of RNA synthesis in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells by BK requires both B1 and B2 receptor subtypes and this action of BK is apparently mediated by de novo synthesis of prostaglandins.", 
    "442": "The sympathoadrenal and the renin-angiotensin systems are involved in blood pressure regulation and are known to be markedly activated during cardiac surgery. Because unexpected hypotensive events have been reported repeatedly during anesthesia in patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the authors questioned whether renin-angiotensin system blockade would alter the hemodynamic control through attenuation of the endocrine response to surgery and/or through attenuation of the pressor effects of exogenous catecholamines.", 
    "443": "Patients with preserved left ventricular function undergoing mitral valve replacement or coronary revascularization were divided into two groups according to preoperative drug therapy: patients receiving ACE inhibitors for at least 3 months (ACEI) group, n = 22) and those receiving other cardiovascular drug therapy (control group, n = 19). Anesthesia was induced using fentanyl and midazolam. Systemic hemodynamic variables were recorded before surgery, after anesthesia induction, during sternotomy, after aortic cross-clamping, after aortic unclamping, as well as after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and during skin closure. Blood was sampled repeatedly up to 24 h after surgery for hormone analysis. To test adrenergic responsiveness, incremental doses of norepinephrine were infused intravenously during hypothermic CPB and after separation from CPB. From the dose-response curves, pressor (defined as mean arterial pressure changes), and vasoconstrictor (defined as systemic vascular resistance changes) effects were analyzed, and the slopes and the dose of norepinephrine required to increase mean arterial pressure by 20% were calculated (PD(20)).", 
    "444": "At no time did the systemic hemodynamics and the need for vasopressor support differ between the two treatment groups. However, for anesthesia induction, significantly less fentanyl and midazolam were given in the ACEI group. Although plasma renin activity was significantly greater in the ACEI group throughout the whole 24-h study period, plasma concentrations of angiotensin II did not differ between the two groups. Similar changes in catecholamines angiotensin II, and plasma renin activity were found in the two groups in response to surgery and CPB. The pressor and constrictor effects of norepinephrine infusion were attenuated markedly in the ACEI group: the dose-response curves were shifted to the right and the slopes were decreased at the two study periods; PD(20) was significantly greater during hypothermic CPB (0.08 micro/kg in the ACEI group vs. 0.03 micro/kg in the control group; P < 0.05) and after separation from CPB (0.52 micro/kg in the ACEI group vs. 0.1 micro/kg in the control group; P < 0.05). In both groups, PD(20) was significantly less during hypothermic CPB than in the period immediately after CPB.", 
    "445": "Long-term ACE inhibitor treatment in patients with preserved left ventricular function alters neither the endocrine response nor the hemodynamic stability during cardiac surgery. However, a significantly attenuated adrenergic responsiveness associated with incomplete blockade of the plasma renin-angiotensin system supports the hypothesis that inhibition of angiotensin II generation and of bradykinin degradation within the vascular wall mediates some of the vasodilatory effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "446": "The binding of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS) in plasma was determined in three healthy young adults after a single 300-mg p.o. dose. By 5 hr after DMPS administration, 62.5% of the total plasma DMPS was bound to proteins. The remainder consisted of nonprotein associated DMPS disulfides (36.6%) and unaltered DMPS (0.9%). Protein-bound DMPS consisted of a DMPS-albumin complex (84%) and a higher molecular weight protein complex (16%), perhaps albumin aggregates. DMPS was released from the isolated DMPS-albumin complex after treatment with dithiothreitol, indicating that it was bound via a disulfide linkage. The half-life of unaltered DMPS was 1.8 hr, whereas that of altered DMPS was 20 hr, suggesting that the DMPS-albumin disulfide complex is stable and that DMPS was released from it slowly. In addition, the biotransformation of OMPS to disulfide forms was extensive. By 9 hr after administration, 10% of the total urinary DMPS was unchanged drug and 90% was altered DMPS. The latter was converted to DMPS by dithiothreitol, indicating that the altered DMPS consisted of disulfides. In 2- to 4-hr urine, DMPS disulfides included cyclic polymeric DMPS disulfides (97%), DMPS-cysteine (1:2) mixed disulfide (2.5%) and acyclic DMPS disulfide (0.5%). The cyclic polymeric DMPS disulfides were present in a major (91.5%) and minor (5.5%) form. DMPS-albumin mixed disulfide and nonprotein DMPS disulfides may prolong the heavy metal mobilizing activity of DMPS and thus may represent reservoirs of DMPS which can be released by disulfide reduction in vivo.", 
    "447": "Mesangial cell growth and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins constitute key features of progressive glomerular injury. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II), two potent vasoconstrictor agents, evoke a number of similar responses in mesangial cells. In rat mesangial cells, we compared ET-1 and Ang II effects on matrix protein production and cell proliferation as well as the potential interaction between the two hormones. When cells in 0.5% fetal calf serum were incubated for 24 hours with various concentrations of ET-1 or Ang II, both peptides stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner, fibronectin and type IV collagen mRNA expression, fibronectin synthesis, and mitogenesis. Incubation with specific receptor antagonists of both hormones demonstrated that endothelin subtype A (ETA) and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors were involved. Preincubation of cells with two different protein kinase C inhibitors or with a neutralizing anti-transforming growth factor-beta antibody, but not an unrelated IgG, diminished the peptide-induced fibronectin synthesis. A dual interrelation seems to exist between ET-1 and Ang II. Thus, the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors quinaprilat and captopril diminished the ET-1-mediated effects, whereas, the ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123 diminished the Ang II-induced fibronectin synthesis and mesangial cell proliferation. Our results suggest that ET-1 and Ang II stimulate matrix protein synthesis and mesangial cell mitogenesis through ETA and AT1 receptors, respectively, by complicated mechanisms, implicating protein kinase C activation, synthesis of transforming growth factor-beta, and release of one peptide by the other. These data could be important for a better understanding of the participation of vasoactive substances in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "448": "Insulin sensitivity may be improved with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, suggesting that inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II) improves insulin resistance. However, the administration of systemic Ang II has also been associated with an improvement in rather than worsening of glucose utilization. Since both stimulating and antagonizing the renin-angiotensin system improve glucose uptake and both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and intravenous Ang II elicit skeletal muscle vasodilation, it is conceivable that hemodynamic factors rather than a direct effect of either Ang II or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on skeletal muscle metabolism modulate the increase in glucose utilization. The direct effects of Ang II on glucose extraction in intact human skeletal muscle have not been previously described. We investigated the effects of local infusion of Ang II on glucose uptake in the forearm of 20 healthy subjects. With the use of the isolated insulin-perfused forearm model, local plasma insulin values were raised to 100 mU/mL over fasting values and maintained there for a 90-minute infusion period. After the first 60 minutes of insulin alone, Ang II was infused into the brachial artery for the last 30 minutes. Intra-arterial Ang II infusion caused a 38% decrease in forearm blood flow (P <.05) and 59% increase in the arteriovenous glucose gradients (P <.05) to maintain a steady glucose utilization (a decrease of 4%, P=NS). Thus, local Ang II infusion does not impair insulin-stimulated glucose utilization. Furthermore, glucose extraction increases to compensate for the decrease in forearm blood flow (as the Fick principle would predict for freely diffusible substances). We conclude that the described increase in glucose utilization from systemic infusion of Ang II and during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment is mediated by hemodynamic factors rather than a direct effect of Ang II on skeletal muscle metabolism.",

Symmetry of onset and evolution of tubular phases between the two kidneys were analyzed, and medullary signal intensity time curves were drawn for each kidney. When asymmetry between kidneys was noted, the same dynamic study was repeated 24 hr later, without captopril sensitization. All patients also underwent renal scintigraphy after administration of captopril to compare captopril-induced changes in both techniques. Three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography was also performed on all patients.",

The results of scintigraphy were concordant in all but one case, in which the segmental distribution of filtration impairment, shown by MR imaging, was not shown by scintigraphy. The renal artery stenosis was shown by MR angiography in 10 of 15 patients (67%).",

    "453": "Recent clinical reports have described the close relationship between insulin resistance and hypertension. Previous reports from our laboratory documented that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have mild insulin resistance, and that this insulin resistance is more intense in SHR with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of antihypertensive treatment with alacepril on insulin resistance in these diabetic SHR. Animals were divided into four groups as follows: group A, nondiabetic SHR; group B, diabetic SHR group C, diabetic SHR treated with 0.05% alacepril; and group, D diabetic SHR treated with 0.1% alacepril. Diabetes was induced by intravenous (IV) injection of STZ (35 mg/kg bodyweight [BW]). Alacepril was given orally by mixing in laboratory chow. Mean (+/- SD) blood pressure was lowered in the alacepril-treated groups (A 212 +/- 7mm Hg and B 213 +/- 8 v C 184 +/- 6 and D 167 +/- 9; P < .01). Total integrated plasma glucose levels were different among all the groups by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (B 53.6 +/- 3.3 mmol/L > C47.2 +/- 4.5 > D 42.3 +/- 1.4 > A 34.2 +/- 1.2; P < .01). Steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG during the insulin suppression test was higher in group B than in group A (15.7 +/- 1.5 mmol/L v 10.4 +/- 0.8; P < .001). The SSPG level (12.9 +/- 0.7) was significantly (P < .001) lower in group D than in untreated group B. In the diabetic groups, blood pressure was positively correlated with integrated plasma glucose (PG) (r = .79, P < .001), SSPG (r = .53, P < .02), and plasma triglyceride (r = .70, P < .001), and negatively with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (r = -.74, P < .001). Alacepril treatment not only dose-relatedly lowered mean blood pressure, but also dose-relatedly improved abnormalities in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in STZ-induced diabetic SHR. These results suggest that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, alacepril, has an antihypertensive effect, but also improves insulin resistance in hypertension with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "454": "At present there is considerable activity in the area of prevention of atherosclerosis-related events using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Large trials have demonstrated significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with long-term use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Reductions in acute ischemic events (e.g., myocardial infarction, unstable angina and need for early revascularization) were independent of ejection fraction and were greater than would be expected from the small reduction in blood pressure that occurred, suggesting that other patients with coronary artery disease may benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. This hypothesis is being tested in multiple double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials with durations of follow-up of 3 to 5 years that will involve approximately 30,000 patients. The trials vary with respect to patient population (e.g., normotensive vs. hypertensive, normolipidemic vs. hyperlipidemic, with vs. without diabetes mellitus), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used and outcome measures. When available, the results of these clinical trials could have very important implications for the role of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for preventing or delaying the development of atherosclerosis-related ischemic events.", 
    "455": "The two angiotensin II receptor subtypes, AT1 and AT2, have been reported to be differentially expressed in the myometrial membrane preparations of nulliparous and pregnant sheep, however, their distribution in the sheep reproductive tract has not been reported. The aim of this study is to map the distribution of AT1 and AT2 receptors in the anoestrus reproductive tract of the sheep by quantitative in vitro autoradiography and to investigate if the density and distribution of the receptors change during pregnancy. The AT2 receptor is abundant in a discrete layer in the myometrium of the anoestrus sheep uterus, whilst the AT1 receptor is expressed at lower levels, predominantly in the endometrium. Near-term pregnant uteri, show a marked change in the expression of angiotensin II receptors: the myometrium no longer expresses detectable AT2 receptors but rather, expresses low levels of AT1 receptors. Angiotensin converting enzyme is found in high concentrations in the blood vessels of the pregnant and non-pregnant sheep reproductive system and on the epithelial cells of the fallopian tubes of the non-pregnant sheep. These studies reveal marked reciprocal changes of angiotensin II receptors, with myometrial AT1 receptors increasing during pregnancy, whilst AT2 receptors fall markedly. These changes suggest that angiotensin II may be involved in regulating changes of uterine structure and function during pregnancy by interaction with multiple receptor subtypes.",

CNP alone and hydralazine alone caused similar increases in forearm blood flow (CNP+, 93.0+/-14.8%; hydralazine+, 84.2+/-22.6%). CNP inhibited the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin I (reduction in overall effect with CNP, 56.8+/-12.9%, P<.001) but not that of angiotensin II.

In captopril-treated rats, the induction of PAI-1 expression by balloon injury was significantly suppressed by 44% (P<.05) in the 7 day group but was not altered in the 3-hour group. Captopril also reduced baseline aortic PAI-1 mRNA.

    "463": "An interesting approach for the treatment of congestive heart failure and chronic hypertension could be to avoid the formation of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and to protect atrial natriuretic factor by blocking neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP). This is supported by recent results obtained with potent dual inhibitors of the two zinc metallopeptidases, such as RB 105, HSCH2CH(CH3)PhCONHCH(CH3)COOH (Fourni\u00e9-Zaluski et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994, 91, 4072-4076), which reduces blood pressure in experimental models of hypertension, independently of the salt and renin angiotensin system status. In order to develop new dual inhibitors with improved affinities, long duration of action, and/or better bioavailabilities, various series of mercaptoacyldipeptides corresponding to the general formula HSCH(R1)CONHCH(R1')CON(R)CH(R2')COOH have been synthesized. The introduction of well-selected beta-branched chains in positions R1 and R1', associated with a tyrosine or a cyclic amino acid in the C-terminal position, led to potent dual inhibitors of NEP and ACE such as 21 [N-[(2S)-2-mercapto-3-methylbutanoyl]-Ile-Tyr] and 22 [N-[(2S)-2-mercapto-3-phenylpropanoyl]Ala-Pro] which have IC50 values in the nanomolar range for NEP and subnanomolar range for ACE. These compounds could have different modes of binding to the two peptidases. In NEP, the dual inhibitors seem to interact only with the S1' and S2' subsites, whereas additional interactions with the S1 binding subsite of ACE probably account for their subnanomolar inhibitory potencies for this enzyme. The localization of the Pro residue of 22 outside the NEP active site is supported by biochemical data using (Arg102,Glu)NEP and molecular modeling studies with thermolysin used as model of NEP. One hour after oral administration in mice of a single dose (2.7 x 10(-5) mol/kg), 21 inhibited 80% and 36% of kidney NEP and lung ACE, respectively, while 22 inhibited 40% of kidney NEP and 56% of lung ACE.", 
    "464": "Myocardial infarction induced hypertrophy of non-infarcted myocardium, in parallel with interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and a decreased capillary density, could increase sensitivity to ischemia. The structural cardiac changes can be reversed by long-term captopril treatment. In the present study, ischemic sensitivity in relation to cardiac perfusion was studied in isolated, perfused hearts of untreated and captopril-treated infarcted rats. In chronically (8 weeks) infarcted hearts, maximal vasodilation in response to administered adenosine and nitroprusside, as well as to endogenously released vasodilators during reperfusion, was decreased, suggesting impaired cardiac perfusion. Ischemic release of purines and lactate was reduced in infarcted hearts, indicating decreased sensitivity to ischemia of the remodeled myocardium. Captopril treatment (3-8 weeks post myocardial infarction), which reversed hypertrophy without affecting the flow capacity of the coronary vascular bed, restored maximal cardiac perfusion. Ischemic ATP breakdown was not affected by captopril, whereas lactate release was even further reduced, suggesting alterations towards a more aerobic ATP production. These data indicate that despite the reduced maximal cardiac perfusion, the remodeled myocardium of infarcted hearts is less sensitive to ischemia. Reversal of hypertrophy by chronic captopril restored maximal cardiac perfusion and led to a better preservation of aerobic ATP production during ischemia.",

    "466": "Treatments based on mechanistic models of heart failure, although entirely rational, have not succeeded in reducing mortality. A more holistic view, based on the concept that the neurohumoral environment is a common factor, encompasses all the previous theoretical models and extends them to provide a new approach to treatment. Vasodilators, inotropes, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors all modify hemodynamics favorably and improve cardiac-performance. Only the vasodilators and ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. With the ACE inhibitors, this effect is related to changes in the levels of circulating angiotensin II and noradrenaline rather than to improved hemodynamics. There is direct evidence that adrenergic receptor density is reduced in chronic heart failure. Vasodilating beta-blockers, like carvedilol, that suppress adrenergic overactivity and reduce preload and afterload, offer a new approach to treatment, but the exploitation of this new opportunity is inhibited by the widely held belief that beta-blockers should be avoided in heart failure. This mistaken view is based on the experience of beta-blockers in angina pectoris and after myocardial infarction, experience that should not exclude their use in patients with congestive heart failure. Vasodilating beta-blockers, introduced at an appropriate dosage, may have an important role to play in the overall management of congestive failure.",

We studied the intracoronary adhesion of PMN and its effect on vascular permeability during reperfusion in isolated guinea-pig hearts. After a global ischemia of 15 min duration. PMN (10(7)) were infused into the coronary system during the first minute of reperfusion. PMN adhesion was measured as difference of applied PMN and those recovered in the effluent perfusate. Coronary permeability was assessed by measuring the rate of transudate formation (TF) on the epicardial surface, before as well as 5, 15 and 30 min after ischemia. Experiments were also performed in the presence of the NO-synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine (10 microM) and the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat (2 microM), the latter known to enhance endogenous nitric oxide formation. Furthermore, the radical scavenger uric acid (0.5 mM) was applied either before and during ischemia or starting after PMN application. Ischemia/reperfusion increased coronary PMN adherence from 23 +/- 1% (basal) to 33 +/- 2%. Whereas ischemia alone did not influence TF (about 100 microliters/min during reperfusion), postischemic PMN infusion led to progressive TF. With nitro-L-arginine, PMN adhesion rose to 45 +/- 3%; TF increased to 212 +/- 30 microliters/min. In contrast, ramiprilat caused post-ischemic adhesion and TF to decline to basal values. In the presence of uric acid (UA) PMN adhesion declined to 26 +/- 2%, however, the subsequent increase in TF after withdrawal of UA was not markedly attenuated. On the other hand, infusion of UA after application of PMN caused a significant decrease of TF. The extracellular antioxidants SOD/catalase were without effect. As shown using luminol enhanced chemiluminescence. No was able to scavenge oxygen free radicals released by activated PMN.

In the clinical setting of ischemia/reperfusion however, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin is widely used to prevent platelet aggregation. The present study therefore investigated whether aspirin in dosages sufficient to inhibit platelet aggregation interferes with the attenuation of myocardial stunning by ramiprilat. Fifteen dogs received either 1 mg/(kg.day) (group I, n = 7) or 10 mg/(kg.day) (group II, n = 8) aspirin orally for 1 week. Both dosages of aspirin inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The dogs were then anesthetized thoracotomized and subjected to 15 min LCx-occlusion and 4 h reperfusion. Before LCx-occlusion, groups I and II received ramiprilat (20 micrograms/kg, i.v.). Systemic hemodynamics, posterior myocardial blood flow (PMBF, colored microspheres) and wall thickening (PWT, sonomicrometry) of these groups were measured and data compared to placebo-controls (group III, n = 11) and dogs receiving only ramiprilat before LCx-occlusion (group IV, n = 11). Four dogs received 10 mg/(kg.day) aspirin without ramiprilat (group V). Mean aortic pressure was kept constant by an intra-aortic balloon, and heart rate did not change. PMBF was not different between the five groups. Under control conditions and during myocardial ischemia PWT was also not different. At 4 h reperfusion PWT was still depressed in group III (-5 +/- 20% of control) and group V (-23 +/- 6%) whereas PWT recovered to the same extent in groups I (46 +/- 23%), II (50 +/- 15%) and IV (58 +/- 18%) (all P < 0.05 v groups III and V).

The left ventricular weight increased 8 and 12 weeks after infarction in comparison to that in sham-operated rats. Among the rats with experimental infarction, treatment with E-4177 significantly decreased the left ventricular weight. Although the infarct size was not affected by E-4177, its administration ameliorated the elevated end-diastolic pressure and reduced the systolic pressure. The effects of this agent on the levels of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor mRNA and ACe mRNA were evaluated in the non-infarcted myocardium by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and binding assays. Treatment with E-4177 reduced both the elevated AT1 mRNA and the number of Ang II receptors, but not the ACE mRNA or ACE activity. While the receptor affinity remained unchanged with this agent, the collagen concentration was decreased. On the other hand, the depressed Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was restored in the non-infarcted myocardium at 8 and 12 weeks after injury to the level seen in the sham-operated rats. These findings suggest that the AT1 receptor antagonist, E-4177, has a beneficial effect on the hemodynamics in spite of the lack of any improvement in the infarct size. These observations may be partly attributed to the prevention of angiotensin II formation during the period of post-infarction healing.",

There was a significant and persistent decrease in left atrial pressure, a brief increase in cardiac output (CO), and a tendency for arterial pressure to be reduced. Significant dose-related diuresis and natriuresis were also observed. Furosemide induced a similar hemodynamic response, associated with greater diuresis and natriuresis. Both agents significantly reduced plasma aldosterone levels. Coinfusion of captopril on day 4 of treatment resulted in similar responses in both the SCH 39370- and furosemide pretreated groups.

Isolated rat hearts (n = 12 per group) were subjected to independent perfusion of left and right coronary beds. The left coronary bed received the ACE/kininase II inhibitor ramiprilat, alone or in combination with either HOE140 (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist) or angiotensin II, before induction of regional ischemia (10 min) by discontinuation of flow to the bed. Ramiprilat (1, 10, or 100 nM) did not significantly alter the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF), but reduced the incidence of sustained VF from 83% in controls to 75, 50, and 25% (p < 0.05). The protective effects of 100 nM ramiprilat were abolished by coinfusion of HOE140 (10 or 100 nM) but not affected by coinfusion of angiotensin II (1 nM). HOE140 (10 nM), when infused alone into the left coronary bed before 7-min ischemia, increased the incidence of sustained VF from 42 to 100% (p < 0.05). Although HOE140 caused vasoconstriction in the left coronary bed when given alone or in combination with ramiprilat, its proarrhythmic effects were not due to a reduction of flow to the bed. We conclude that selective inhibition of ACE/kininase II in the ischemic zone moderately attenuates reperfusion arrhythmias and that enhanced bradykinin availability rather than reduced angiotensin II in synthesis contributes to such an effect.", 
    "482": "Microalbuminuria is a predictor of overt diabetic nephropathy and macrovascular disease. Thirty-one diabetic patients with persistent urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) of 20-200 mu g min-1 were randomised to receive indapamide 2.5 mg or captopril 37.5 mg daily for 12 weeks. After a 4-week washout, patients received the alternate agent for 12 weeks. Resting blood pressure (BP), AER, cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c were measured at baseline, after 6 and 12 weeks of each treatment, and after a 4-week washout period following each treatment arm. Results from patients who completed at least one treatment arm were analysed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). AER (median value and interquartile range) decreased significantly from baseline after treatment with indapamide and captopril [60(27-106) vs. 40(14-112) and 33(17-100); p < 0.005], but there was no difference between the effects of the two agents. Mean systolic BP (SBP) was also significantly reduced with treatment, and no difference was noted between the effects of the two agents. No correlation between changes in AER and SBP was noted with either agent. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP), cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c did not change during the study. These results suggest that indapamide is an effective alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.", 
    "483": "We evaluated the effects of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (idrapril) in terms of hemodynamics and ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction in rats. The animals were randomly assigned to four experimental groups. Myocardial infarction was induced by left coronary artery ligation in the first two groups treated with either idrapril (300 mg kg-1 day-1) or vehicle for 4 weeks after myocardial infarction. Two groups of sham-operated rats were treated accordingly. Hemodynamics were measured, and the diastole-arrested hearts were analyzed morphometrically to quantify left ventricular (LV) remodeling and infarct size. In infarcted rats, idrapril reduced the arterial systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 128 +/- 10 to 97 +/- 6 mm Hg (p < 0.05) and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) from 19 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 3 mm Hg (p < 0.01). The decrease in diastolic wall stress conferred by idrapril to infarcted rats (from 499 +/- 99 to 269 +/- 68 dynes mm-2, p < 0.05) was mainly due to a reduction in LVEDP and, to a lesser extent, in LV volume. Idrapril also reduced body and heart weights as compared with those of vehicle-treated animals. Four-week treatment with idrapril initiated immediately after myocardial infarction reduced LVEDP and limited LV wall stress, a major prognostic factor for the progression toward chronic ventricular failure.", 
    "484": "Therapy with angiotensin II-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been suggested to prevent cardiovascular hypertrophy in hypertension even in doses that are subantihypertensive. We investigated the effects of two different ACE inhibitors on blood pressure and cardiovascular changes during as well as after discontinuation of treatment in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were treated with either enalapril (ENA) or ramipril (RAM) from age 12 to age 20 weeks. Each drug was given in either an antihypertensive (ENA 15 mg center dot kg-1, RAM 3 mg center dot kg-1) or a subantihypertensive (ENA 50 mu g center dot kg-1, RAM 10 mu g center dot kg-1) dose. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced with antihypertensive doses of ENA (26%) as well as RAM (21%). Regression of cardiovascular changes occurred as reduction in left ventricular (LV) weight/body weight ratio (25 and 21% for ENA and RAM, respectively), reduction in perfusion pressure at maximal vasodilation of the perfused hindquarter (PPdil, 17 and 17%), and reduction in maximal developed pressure (PPmax, 13 and 17%). These effects partly persisted 10 weeks after treatment was discontinued. However, treatment with subantihypertensive doses of ENA and RAM had no effect on MAP, LV/body weight ratio, PPdil, or PPmax. Overall, regression of cardiovascular parameters correlated closely to the decrease in MAP. Similarly, no changes in MAP, LV weight/body weight ratio, PPdil, or PPmax were noted when young SHR were treated with subantihypertensive doses of RAM from age 6 to age 12 weeks, during which time hypertension becomes established. At doses having equal effects on blood pressure, plasma concentrations of RAM were considerably lower than those of ENA. Skeletal muscle concentrations were very low or undetectable in comparison to plasma concentrations for both drugs. Therefore, both RAM and ENA caused regression of cardiovascular changes that could be explained by a concomitant reduction in blood pressure. This regression persisted for a considerable time after discontinuation of treatment. On the other hand, no specific antitrophic effects in the absence of blood pressure reduction was evident with either drug. Furthermore, despite substantial differences in plasma concentrations, RAM, and ENA administered chronically appeared to affect cardiovascular parameters equally in the adult SHR.", 
    "485": "Blood pressure increases were inhibited by feeding a diet containing sour milk fermented by a starter containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In rats fed with the sour milk, the angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity of the aorta was significantly lower than that of rats fed with the control commercial diet.", 
    "486": "In the management of patients with chronic heart failure, our attention is shifting from just improving left ventricular function and abolishing ventricular arrhythmias to improving personal longevity. Importantly, sudden cardiac death is a pattern of death in as many as a half of patients with chronic heart failure. Arrhythmias are common in this disorder, but may possibly be a marker of diseased heart rather than a predictor of sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms and triggers of rapid ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation responsible for sudden cardiac death have not been well established. At present, it is important to be reminded that pharmacologic augmentation of cardiac contractility or suppression of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias is not an effective approach to preventing sudden cardiac death, but may even be deleterious. Three groups of drugs that have shown efficacy in preventing sudden cardiac death in patients with chronic heart failure are amiodarone, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Although how these drugs improve prognosis of heart failure are not clear at present, myocardial protection by these agents appears to be most important.", 
    "487": "The use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors has been seen to reduce the efficacy of many antihypertensive drugs. However, cyclooxygenase inhibitors are normally non-selective because they affect both vascular tissue, where the endothelial prostanoids exert principally a vasodilatory action, and the kidneys, where they also play an important role in regulating hydroelectrolytic metabolism by redistribution of intraparenchymal flow. To evaluate the relative importance of vascular district in the hypertensive patient, we administered ibuprofen - a drug acting with only a minimal antagonist activity. A group of 20 male hypertensives were randomly allocated, according to a single-blind protocol, to treatment with amlodipine (A, 10 mg/day) or lisinopril (L, 20 mg/day). Blood pressure was significantly reduced after 30 days, with a mean difference of -21.75 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) (95% confidence interval (Cl): -27.46 to -16.04; P< 0.0001) and -14.15 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (95% Cl: -17.13 to -11.17; P< 0.0001). Brachial artery compliance showed a mean increase of 1.657 x 10(-7) dyn-1 cm(4) (95% Cl: 1.188 to 2.126; P<0.001), and forearm resistances showed a mean decrease of -41.973 mmHg ml(-1)s (95% Cl: -75.479 to -8.467; P = 0.017). Changes in compliance were significantly related to those in SBP (r= -0.546; P= 0.013). The administration of ibuprofen (400 mg, three times a day for 3 days) was accompanied by a slight but significant increase in SBP, but not in brachial artery compliance or forearm resistances. Only SBP was affected, showing a mean increase of 4.25 mmHg (95% Cl: 1.26 to 7.24; P = 0.008). There was also reduced urinary excretion of PGI(2) and TXA(2) metabolites. The mean change in 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) was 45.71 ng per g urinary creatinine (uCr) (95% Cl: -0.16 to-91.25; P= 0.049) and -73.17 ng (g uCr)(-1) (95% Cl: -38.81 to -107.53; P<0.001), respectively. The mean decrease in TXA(2) catabolites was highly significant: -39.2 ng (g uCr)(-1) (95% Cl: -18.17 to-60.22; P< 0.001) and -102.87 ng (g uCr)(-1) (95% Cl: -61.86 to -143.88; P< 0.001) for TXB(2) and 2,3-dinor-TXB(2), respectively. Our study highlighted an inverse correlation between changes in blood pressure and those in urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF(1alpha) excretion, irrespective of antihypertensive regimen. This suggests that, in the hypertensive patient treated with NSAIDs, inhibition of vascular prostanoid synthesis may play an important role in countering the efficacy of an important vascular tone regulatory mechanism.", 
    "488": "The purpose of the present study was to separately investigate the effects of two different dosages of captopril on pressor, vascular and humoral response to acute extracellular volume expansion in patients with borderline hypertension (BHT). Thirty-five patients were randomly allocated in two groups undergoing acute saline infusion (0.40 ml/min/kg for 45 min and 0.15 ml/min/kg for 75 min)before and after a 7-day period of treatment with either placebo or captopril at the dose of 12.5 (LD-CAP) or 50 mg (HD-CAP) twice a day. At baseline the effects of LD-CAP were limited to an increase in PRA and to a decrease in plasma aldosterone whereas HD-CAP decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), forearm vascular resistance (FVR) and increased venous distensibility (VV(30)) as well. After saline loading patients treated with HD-CAP showed an increase in SBP, DBP not observed in patients allocated to LD-CAP. Urinary sodium excretion in response to NaCl loading was selectively enhanced by LD-CAP (+25%) whereas HD-CAP did not (+6.3%). The present data suggest that low-doses of ACE-inhibitors acting through a selective blockade of RAA not associated with hemodynamic changes can enhance the natriuretic response to acute volume expansion in borderline hypertensives.", 
    "489": "1. The effect of pretreatment with bacterial endotoxin (LPS, 10 micrograms, i.v., 24 h) on the bradykinin B1 and B2 receptor-induced oedema in the rat paw, and the interaction of B1-mediated responses with other inflammatory mediators, was investigated. 2. Intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of the selective B1 agonist, des-Arg9-BK (DABK, 100 nmol) in naive animals pretreated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril caused a small increase in paw volume (0.04 +/- 0.003 ml, mean +/- s.e. mean, n = 6), while the B2-selective agonist, tyrosine8-bradykinin (T-BK, 3 nmol) induced marked oedema (0.36 +/- 0.02 ml). However, i.pl. injection of DABK (3-300 nmol) in rats pretreated with LPS (24 h beforehand) resulted in a marked dose- and time-related increase in paw volume, with mean ED50 of 24.1 nmol. In contrast, oedema caused by T-BK (3 nmol) was reduced by 79 +/- 4% in animals treated with LPS when compared with naive animals. 3. Oedema caused by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 10 nmol) was unaffected by LPS treatment, while oedema induced by histamine (100 nmol), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10 nmol) and substance P (SP, 3 nmol) was reduced (P < 0.05). 4. The selective B1 antagonist, des-Arg9[Leu8]-BK (100-300 nmol), produced dose-dependent inhibition of DABK (100 nmol)-induced paw oedema in LPS-treated animals with mean IC50 of 134 nmol, while the selective B2 antagonists, Hoe 140 and NPC 17731 (each 10 nmol), had no effect. 5. Treatment of animals with dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg-1, s.c.) 24 or 48 h prior to LPS injection resulted in a graded inhibition of DABK (100 nmol)-induced oedema formation (58 +/- 3 and 82 +/- 2%, respectively), and almost reversed to control value oedema formation induced by T-BK (3 nmol) in LPS-pretreated rats. Cycloheximide (1 mg kg-1, s.c.) or indomethacin (2 mg kg-1, i.p.) pretreatment 24 and 1 h prior to LPS injection, respectively, markedly inhibited DABK (100 nmol)-induced paw oedema (98 +/- 2 and 50 +/- 4%, respectively). 6. Intraplantar injection of submaximal dose of DABK (10 nmol) in LPS-treated rats produced modest paw oedema (0.09 +/- 0.03 ml). However, i.pl. injections of PGE2, prostacyclin (PGI2), calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), SP, 5-HT, or platelet activating factor (PAF) (each 1 nmol), which alone caused little or no paw oedema, resulted in a potentiation of the DABK-induced oedema. The increases in paw volume (in ml) were: PGE2 + DABK (0.31 +/- 0.03), PGI2 + DABK (0.39 +/- 0.02), CGRP+DABK (0.35 +/- 0.04), DABK+SP (0.33 +/- 0.04), DABK + 5-HT (0.40 +/- 0.02) and DABK+PAF (0.38 +/- 0.016) ml. In contrast, histamine (1 nmol) was ineffective in potentiating the response to DABK. 7. The selective B1 receptor antagonist, DALBK (100-300 nmol), produced dose-dependent inhibition of paw oedema potentiation induced by co-injection of DABK and other mediators with mean ID50S (nmol) of: 180, 160, 139 and 135 in the presence of PGE2, PGI2, SP and 5-HT, respectively. 8. These results demonstrate that DABK-induced increase in paw volume in LPS-treated rats is probably mediated by induction of B1 receptors, associated with downregulation of B2 receptors. The induction of B1 receptors by LPS is sensitive to dexamethasone and cycloheximide treatment and requires activation of cyclo-oxygenase pathway. In addition, B1 receptors, when upregulated following LPS treatment, can interact in a synergistic manner with several inflammatory mediators such as PGI2, PGE2, CGRP, PAF and 5-HT. Such results indicate that induction of the B1 receptor might have a significant pathophysiological role in modulating chronic inflammatory diseases.", 
    "490": "Hypertension poses serious health risks for blacks because this population presents with earlier onset and more severe forms of the disease than do nonblacks. Although diuretics are the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy In the black population, investigators have expressed concern about adverse metabolic effects, such as hypokalemia, produced by the high doses of diuretics traditionally prescribed for blacks. Recent evidence suggests that black patients may respond equally well to the new generation of cardioselective beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, particularly when these agents are used together with a diuretic. A new low-dose multimechanism agent that combines the cardioselective beta-blocker bisoprolol fumarate with hydrochlorothiazide, a benzothiazine diuretic, is now available for first-line therapy for hypertension. Results of two US multicenter trials--including a subset analysis of black patients--indicate that the once-daily agent is highly effective in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure throughout a 24-hour period in both black and nonblack patients. The agent is well tolerated in blacks and non-blacks and has a side-effect profile comparable to placebo. Because of its efficacy and safety in black patients, bisoprolol fumarate/-hydrochlorothiazide is an appropriate therapeutic option for first-line therapy of hypertension in the black population.",

Of 9.4% (n = 107) of patients were classified as having diabetes in the GOPC and 20.4% (n = 310) in the SC (p<0.001). Most patients with diabetes were taking oral hypoglycemic agents (98.1% in GOPC vs. 84.5% in SC). Glibenclamide was the sufonylurea used most often as monotherapy in both settings (50.5% in GOPC vs. 40.6% in SC). The combined use of a sulfonylurea with metformin was common in both settings (22.4% in GOPC vs. 28.4% in SC). Metformin monotherapy (1.9% in GOPC vs. 2.6% in SC) and combination treatment of insulin with an oral agent (0% in GOPC vs. 2.6% in SC) were rarely prescribed.

In the GOPC, diuretics (indapamide 14.3% other 59%) and methyldopa (9.5%) were the most frequent choices of antihypertensive drugs when used as monotherapy in subjects without diabetes. In the SC, apart from diuretics (indapamide 12.9%, other 20.3%), beta-blockers (29%) also were prescribed frequently. If treated with only one antihypertensive drug, most patients with diabetes in the GOPC were prescribed indapamide (72.7%), and patients in the SC were treated mainly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (35%) indapamide (22.5%), or calcium-channel blockers (13.8%).",

Emergency physicians and otolaryngologists should play a key role in identifying patients with angioedema associated with ACEIs. Every patient with acute angioedema, especially in the region of the mouth, the tongue, and the upper airways, must be asked for medication with ACEIs. The physician must be aware of the fact that a moderate swelling can rapidly develop to a massive swelling, which requires an intubation or even a coniotomy. Thus, in any of these cases, the patient should be observed at least for 24 hours in the clinic or until the edema subsided almost completely.", 
    "499": "In chronic heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors produce an acute decrease in aldosterone levels. Long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is, however, associated with aldosterone suppression that is weak, variable, and unsustained (ie, aldosterone escapes). The possible harmful effects of this residual aldosterone are multiple Magnesium loss caused by aldosterone and by diuretics could contribute to coronary artery spasm and arrhythmias. Aldosterone blocks norepinephrine uptake by the myocardium; extracellular catecholamines may, therefore, lead to arrhythmias and ischemia. Aldosterone has been shown to have an acute arrhythmogenic effect as well as a detrimental effect on parasympathetic and baroreflex function. Both angiotensin II and aldosterone stimulate myocardial fibrosis, which may lead to a higher incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Spironolactone therapy added to the regimen of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretic has been shown to cause natriuresis, magnesium retention, increased myocardial norepinephrine uptake, and reduced incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. It may well be that residual aldosterone mediates many harmful effects in chronic heart failure and that to optimize the benefit of blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may require specific blockade of residual aldosterone as well as traditional angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "500": "The effects of ACE inhibitors on the stenosed kidney in patients with unilateral arterial stenosis are not well characterised. While there are conflicting reports, some experimental and clinical evidence suggest that the stenosed kidney may undergo atrophy: secondary to effective blood pressure lowering and decreased perfusion pressure distally, or due to other mechanism/s. Such a loss of renal function may go unrecognised. In view of the widespread use of ACE inhibitors, the fate of the stenosed kidney needs to be more accurately known.", 
    "501": "1. The objective was to compare two means of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and selective antagonism of angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor] on renal function in 10 healthy normotensive volunteers on a normal sodium diet. Since mechanisms of action may differ between both drugs, a synergistic action was further studied by combining the two drugs. 2. The design was a double-blind randomized acute administration of either placebo or a single oral dose of enalapril, 20 mg, followed in each case by administration of the AT1 selective antagonist losartan potassium, 50 mg orally. 3. The methods included measurements of hormones (plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone), blood pressure and renal function from 45 to 135 min after administration of placebo or enalapril, and from 45 to 135 min after losartan and placebo or losartan and enalapril. Renal function was studied using clearance of sodium, lithium, uric acid, inulin and para-aminohippuric acid. To examine further the determinants of glomerular filtration at the microcirculation level, fractional clearance of neutral dextran was determined and sieving curves were applied on a hydrodynamic model of ultrafiltration. 4. Losartan did not change plasma renin activity, blood pressure or glomerular filtration rate, but increased significantly renal plasma flow and urinary excretion of sodium and uric acid. Enalapril increased plasma renin activity and renal plasma flow, and decreased blood pressure without natriuretic, lithiuretic or uricosuric effects. The renal vasodilatation was potentiated when losartan and enalapril were combined, despite a further rise in plasma renin. In contrast to enalapril, losartan either alone or in combination with enalapril significantly depressed fractional clearances of dextran of small radii (34-42 A). These changes in fractional clearances of dextran were presumably related to the rise in glomerular plasma flow since the other major determinants of filtration, i.e. transcapillary glomerular pressure gradient, ultrafiltration coefficient and membrane property, were computed as unchanged by either losartan, enalapril or a combination of both. 5. In conclusion, these findings suggest that in normal sodium-repleted man the renal, hormonal and blood pressure effects of AT1 antagonism and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition are not strictly similar and could be synergistic.",

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures remained stable during the pretreatment period; 24-h urinary protein excretion increased progressively from 0.79 +/- 0.13 to 1.23 +/- 0.18 g/24 h (p < 0.05) (mean +/- standard error). Captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) for 3 months reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly (p < 0.01). Simultaneously, 24-h urinary protein excretion declined by 41 +/- 2.4%, to 0.70 +/- 0.12 g/24 h (p < 0.05) while GFR, ERPF, and fractional filtration demonstrated small but insignificant changes. Subsequently, increase in captopril to 50 mg b.i.d. for the remaining 6 months did not produce further significant changes in renal hemodynamics, blood pressure, or urinary protein excretion (0.48 +/- 0.10 g/24 h at the termination of the study). Non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients with early nephropathy and mild to moderate hypertension demonstrate a progressive increase in urinary protein excretion. Administration of captopril resulted in prompt control of hypertension and reversal of the increase in urinary protein excretion.",

This decrease in pressure causes a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and proximal tubular urine flow. This decrease in turn hampers tubular hippurate transit and transport across the luminal membrane, leading to intrarenal hippurate retention and, in more severe cases, decreased renal hippurate uptake.",

Healthy women were studied in both sodium depletion (n = 8) and normal balance of sodium and potassium (n = 6). Each woman underwent paired renal functional explorations (by the clearance method during hypotonic polyuria and subsequent antidiuresis) in the absence and in the presence of enalapril. In both experimental conditions enalapril failed to affect urinary prostanoid excretions. Only in the presence of hyperreninemia induced by salt depletion, enalapril was effective in inducing renal tubular effects only partly consistent with a depressed activity of angiotensin-aldosterone system. Specifically, in sodium depletion enalapril treatment promoted a decreasing trend in urinary salt excretion, dependent in turn on selective stimulation of the distal tubule NaCl transport. Furthermore, plasma potassium concentration was reduced despite the concomitant decrease in urinary potassium excretion.",

In 32 patients the suspension of RVH was formed on the basis of clinical features of accelerated phase of hypertension. In 42 patients the renal arteriography was performed-this group includes all patients with positive results of at least one captopril test, among them 32 patients with clinical symptoms of accelerated hypertension. In 24 cases the critical stenosis of renal artery was revealed. The diagnostic value of CRT-M, CRT-F and CAT was referred to critical stenosis of renal artery (> 75% of the lumen) as a criterium of RVH. The following values of sensitivity, specificity and discrimination capacity for CRT were established: for CRT-M 70%, 50%, 21% respectively, for CRT-F 88%, 44%, 40% respectively. CAT demonstrated the highest specificity (100%) as well as discrimination capacity (75%) in spite of the relatively low sensitivity (67%). The absence of false positive results of CAT as well as considerable percentage of false positive CRT results stress the importance of isotopic test as basic method for the diagnosis of RVH. Simplicity of the test, its low price and availability as well as immediately obtained results allow to propose CAT as a routine ambulatory screening test for RVH.",

Recently, he noted tenderness of his mouth, face, swelling of lips and tongue for 3 to 4 h after taking his morning dose of enalapril. These symptoms abated spontaneously, so he continued taking the drugs. He again noted similar episodes of angioedema 29 days after the first experience. He had no further episodes of angioedema or dry cough after cessation of enalapril.

They all had a history of clinically stable type II diabetes > 3 months, microalbuminuria and early diabetic nephropathy (a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate ranging from 20 to 300 micrograms/min) and a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90-100 mm Hg (Korotkoff phase V) inclusive at both entry and after 3-4 weeks' placebo treatment. The aim of treatment was to achieve a reduction in sitting DBP to < 90 mm Hg 24-30 h after the last dose of lisinopril or 12-18 hours after the last dose of nifedipine and to evaluate the effect of these treatments on UAE over 12 months. The effect of the two treatments on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was also evaluated in a subset of patients. Management of diabetes with oral hypoglycaemic drugs, diet and insulin alone or in combination was permitted. Median UAE fell on lisinopril from 65.5 (range 20-297) micrograms/min at baseline to 39.0 (2-510) micrograms/min after 12 months. On nifedipine median UAE fell from 63.0 (range 20-289) micrograms/min at baseline to 58.0 (9-1192) micrograms/min after 12 months. The estimated median difference between the effects of the two treatments was 20 micrograms/min (P = 0.0006). Over 12 months both treatments produced similar falls in sitting BP from 163 +/- 17/99 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- s.d.) to 147 +/- 18/88 +/- 10 mm Hg for lisinopril and from 161 +/- 18/97 +/- 5 mm Hg to 150 +/- 18/88 +/- 9 mm Hg for nifedipine. Ambulatory BP was assessed in a subset of patients and using areas under the BP-time curve (AUC) a comparison of the effects of the two treatments showed no between-treatment differences. Creatinine clearance, glycaemic control (HbA1c) and lipid profiles did not change significantly during either treatment. Frequency of withdrawals and adverse events were similar for both treatments. We conclude that lisinopril has a significantly more beneficial effect on UAE than nifedipine despite similar effects on both BP and glycaemic control in type II diabetic patients with hypertension.",

This antihypertensive therapy lowered DBP (104 +/- 0.8 to 78 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, P < 0.0001), but had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i or AVP-stimulated [Ca2+]i responses. Basal platelet [Ca2+]i following antihypertensive therapy (49 +/- 3.4 ng/ml) were not different from those prior to therapy (52 +/- 4.7 ng/ml). Additionally, [Ca2+]i responses to AVP following therapy (554 +/- 74 units) were not different from those prior to treatment (595 +/- 49 units). Following antihypertensive therapy, [Ca2+]i responses to 200 micrograms/ml of LDL were decreased fourfold (P < 0.05). These results suggest that antihypertensive therapy with a calcium channel blocker may potentially impact the atherogenic process by reducing the platelet [Ca2+]i rise, and potentially the aggregatory response, to LDL.",

Forty-seven patients aged > or = 65 years with CHF (EF < 40%) participated in a prospective nonrandomized series. Blood samples for plasma renin activity (PRA) were drawn before and 60 minutes after 50 mg of oral captopril. Twenty-four hours later, captopril was administered (up to 75 mg/day over a 4 day period), and renal laboratory and clinical assessment were performed at baseline and for a 9 day period. In 7 of 47 patients (14.9%), deterioration of renal function was observed. During the captopril test, the PRA increased significantly after 1 hour in almost all patients and the mean blood pressure decreased from 99.2 +/- 14.6 mmHg to 92.2 +/- 13.7 mmHg (p < 0.001). All patients whose baseline PRA level was < 1.9 ng/ml/hr and whose stimulated PRA was < 3.2 ng/ml/hr maintained a stable renal function throughout the study period. Significant statistical correlation (p < 0.05) was found between the initial PRA, the changes in PRA or mean blood pressure during the captopril test, and the change in plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance in the entire group, and was even more evident in a subgroup of patients with an ejection fraction > or = 30%. All these correlations were not statistically significant in the patients with an ejection fraction < 30%.

    "533": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril on the elastic properties of the aorta. A standard diuretic antihypertensive drug, hydrochlorothiazide, served for comparisons. Increased aortic stiffness leads to a reduction of the buffering windkessel function and is a major component in the pathophysiology of systolic hypertension, inducing an increase in left ventricular afterload and arterial pulsatile stress as well as a decrease in the subendocardial blood supply. Stiffness of arteries increases with age and blood pressure, and depends on the functional elastic structures of the aortic wall. ACE inhibitors have been shown to directly influence elastic properties of peripheral arteries. Seventeen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (age 45-67 years) were treated for 3 months double-blind randomized with either cilazapril (C) 5 mg daily (n = 9) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg daily (n = 8). Aortic elastic properties were noninvasively assessed by measurement of pulse wave velocity along the aorta at rest and during isometric handgrip stress. Accelerated pulse wave velocity indicates elevated arterial stiffness and vice versa. A pressure standardized index of aortic cross-sectional distensibility (2 m) was calculated from arterial mean pressure and pulse wave velocity. Compared with pretreatment values, both therapies significantly reduced blood pressure and pulse wave velocity at rest (C: 9.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.7 +/- 0.7 m/sec; HcTZ: 8.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.4 m/sec; means +/- SEM p < 0.05). During isometric stress only C showed a significant decrease in pulse wave velocity (C: 11.3 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.1 +/- 0.8 m/sec; HCTZ: 9.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.5 m/sec; means +/- SEM p < 0.05). The index 2m at rest and during handgrip increased significantly (p < 0.05) after C but not after HCTZ. With cilazapril we obtained steeper slopes for the treatment-induced reductions in blood pressure and pulse wave velocity for both rest and handgrip stress values. Correlation of the data at rest and during stress revealed a direct relationship between blood pressure and pulse wave velocity. HCTZ linearly extended the relation observed before treatment toward lower values of blood pressure and corresponding pulse wave velocity without changing the relation per se. Cilazapril, in contrast, moved the relation between these variables and decelerated the pulse wave velocities to a greater extent than would have been expected from the corresponding blood pressure reduction (delta approximately 1 m/sec). These results in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension support the idea that ACE inhibitors, in addition to reducing blood pressure, may exert an additional hemodynamic effect in improving the elastic properties of the aorta.", 
    "534": "Alterations in glomerular hemodynamics may play an important role in the progression of renal dysfunction. Accordingly, treating not only systemic hypertension, but also glomerular hypertension is important for conservation of renal function in patients with renal disease. However, glomerular capillary pressure does not necessarily change in parallel with systemic blood pressure due to unique mechanisms that control the resistance of glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles. While myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback play an important role in controlling afferent arteriolar resistance, angiotensin II is a major determinant of efferent arteriolar tone. Calcium antagonists block almost all mechanisms that constrict the afferent arteriole, rendering glomerular capillary pressure dependent on systemic pressure. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors dilate efferent arterioles, thereby lowering glomerular capillary pressure. Such differences should be taken into account when selecting adequate drugs for the treatment of hypertension with various degrees of renal dysfunction.",

Five patients (group I) who had developed chronic cough induced by ACEI were evaluated to determine the bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) by challenge with methacholine inhalation using a reservoir method at Respiratory Unit, Chulalongkorn Hospital University. Five patients (group II) who did not experience coughing associated with ACEI were also challenged as controls. The results revealed that two patients (40%) in group I demonstrated BHR with the mean PC20 at 15 mg/ml of methacholine solution. On the other hand, none of the patients in group II disclosed BHR. We concluded that coughing during ACEI therapy may be due to an increased inflammatory state in the airway in some susceptible subjects.", 
    "536": "Peptidic drugs such as beta-lactam aminocephalosporin antibiotics (e.g., cephalexin) and the ACE inhibitors lisinopril, quinapril, and benzazepril are apparently absorbed, at least in part, by the intestinal dipeptide transporter system (DTS). Although many properties of the DTS have been elucidated, including isolation of the carrier protein, little is known about the distribution of this transporter along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The objectives of the present study were to (1) validate that SQ-29852 (a lysylproline ACE inhibitor) is a stable and specific probe for evaluation of the DTS in rats and (2) provide fundamental in vivo information on the distribution of the DTS along the GI tract of rats. Most of the previous studies that explored the location of the DTS typically involved either in vitro uptake or in situ disappearance of unstable or nonspecific probes. SQ-29852, on the other hand, is an ideal probe for evaluation of the DTS because it is chemically and metabolically stable and it is absorbed almost exclusively by the DTS. SQ-29852 appears to be a specific probe for the DTS because the dose-dependent reduction in absorption from about 60% to less than 8% (3 and 3000 mg/kg, respectively) suggests that at least 85% of an orally administered low dose of SQ-29852 is absorbed by a saturable process, which was shown previously to be the DTS. [14C]SQ-29852 was administered by gavage to intact rats and via an indwelling cannula in one of the following sections of the intestine: duodenum, jejunum, ileum and proximal colon (n = 4 for each site). On the basis of the recovery of [14C]SQ-29852 in urine, the DTS is apparently distributed throughout the entire GI tract of rats, including the proximal colon. The present results are consistent with previously reported results on the absorption of natural dipeptides in humans and rats and immunohistochemical evaluation in rats; however, they disagree with a recent report in humans with amoxicillin. This difference is discussed in terms of the specificity and stability of various drugs that have been used as probes of the DTS.", 
    "537": "This study compares blood pressure (BP) changes during active antihypertensive treatment and placebo as assessed by conventional and ambulatory BP measurement. Older patients (> or = 60 years, n=337) with isolated systolic hypertension by conventional sphygmomanometry at the clinic were randomized to placebo or active treatment consisting of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg/d). At baseline, clinic systolic/diastolic BP averaged 175/86 mm Hg and 24-hour and daytime ambulatory BPs averaged 148/80 and 154/85 mm Hg, respectively. After 13 months (median) of active treatment, clinic BP had dropped by 22.7/7.0 mm Hg and 24-hour and daytime BPs by 10.5/4.5 and 9.7/4.3 mm Hg, respectively (P<.001 for all). However, clinic (9.8/1.6 mm Hg), 24-hour (2.1/1.1 mm Hg), and daytime (2.9/1.0 mm Hg) BPs decreased also during placebo (P<.05, except for daytime diastolic BP); these decreases represented 43%/23%, 20%/24%, and 30%/23% of the corresponding BP fall during active treatment. After subtraction of placebo effects, the net BP reductions during active treatment averaged only 12.9/5.4, 8.3/3.4, and 6.8/3.2 mm Hg for clinic, 24-hour, and daytime BPs, respectively. The effect of active treatment was also subject to diurnal variation (P<.05). Changes during placebo in hourly systolic and diastolic BP means amounted to (median) 21% (range, -1% to 42%) and 25% (-3% to 72%), respectively, of the corresponding changes during active treatment. In conclusion, expressed in millimeters of mercury, the effect of antihypertensive treatment on BP is larger with conventional than with ambulatory measurement. Regardless of whether BP is measured by conventional sphygmomanometry or ambulatory monitoring, a substantial proportion of the long-term BP changes observed during active treatment may be attributed to placebo effects. Thus, ambulatory monitoring uncorrected for placebo or control observations, like conventional sphygmomanometry, overestimates BP responses in clinical trials of long duration.", 
    "538": "Hypertension is associated with an altered design of resistance vessels and decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to acetylcholine. A role of angiotensin II in both defects is suggested by animal experiments in which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition reverted structural and functional changes. We investigated the effects of 20 weeks of therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (5 mg twice daily) on the endothelium-dependent response to brachial artery infusions of acetylcholine and the endothelium-independent vascular relaxation after sodium nitroprusside in 22 subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In addition, we measured minimal forearm vascular resistance (ratio of mean arterial pressure and forearm blood flow after heating, ischemia, and ischemic exercise) as an indirect estimate of vascular structure. Cilazapril decreased blood pressure (151 +/- 14/99 +/- 7 mm Hg during placebo to 138 +/- 17/89 +/- 8 mm Hg after cilazapril treatment, P<.01) and baseline (42.2 +/- 12.6 to 37.1 +/- 10.6 U, P<.05) and minimal (3.0 +/- 1.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.7 U, 15.9 +/- 20.2%; P<.05) forearm vascular resistances. The change in minimal forearm vascular resistance was unrelated to age, duration of hypertension, or changes in blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside increased forearm blood flow from 2.6 +/- 1.0 to 11.4 +/- 5.9 mL/min per 100 mL and acetylcholine to 21.5 +/- 17.8. Both responses did not change after cilazapril. The data provide indirect evidence that cilazapril therapy may improve vascular structure in human hypertension. The lack of relationship between vascular and blood pressure changes would be compatible with experimental evidence supporting a role for angiotensin II in the development and regression of vascular changes, but this needs further study. Therapy with cilazapril for 20 weeks, like other antihypertensive therapy, does not seem to influence endothelial vasodilator function in humans to a significant degree.", 
    "539": "We investigated the effect of long-term administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on renal arterioles in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) using a morphometric method and vascular cast technique. Rats were treated with lisinopril beginning at 4 weeks of age. At 15 weeks of age, the kidney vessels were fixed when maximally relaxed. Resin was perfused into the right kidney to make a cast of the renal vasculature. The opposite kidney was used for the morphometric study to evaluate structural changes of the vascular wall. The vascular cast study demonstrated a significant reduction in the lumen diameter of the afferent but not the efferent arterioles in SHR compared with those in WKY. In lisinopril-treated rats, the afferent arteriolar lumen diameters were significantly larger than those of the respective control groups in both strains. However, treatment did not affect the lumen diameter of efferent arterioles in either strain. The morphometric study revealed that the cross-sectional area of afferent arteriolar media was significantly smaller in SHR than WKY, suggesting that the impaired growth of the afferent arteriolar media was involved in the narrowed afferent arteriolar lumen in SHR. The presence of significantly smaller media-lumen ratio, greater media cross-sectional area, and larger internal as well as external diameters of the afferent arterioles in treated SHR than in untreated rats suggested that lisinopril treatment normalizes the structure of the afferent arterioles in SHR by vascular reverse remodeling and by inducing media growth.", 
    "540": "In this study we evaluated in hypertensive patients the effects of drug-induced left ventricular hypertrophy regression on cardiac autonomic control, as assessed by means of heart period variability analysis. Power spectral analysis of 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed in 30 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline, after 1 year of lisinopril treatment, and after 1 month of drug withdrawal. At the same times, patients underwent 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, echocardiographic study, and plasma renin activity assessment. Lisinopril treatment increased plasma renin activity and reduced 24-hour systolic and diastolic pressures (from 159 +/- 14 to 121 +/- 8 and from 103 +/- 7 to 80 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively) and left ventricular mass index (from 159 +/- 33 to 134 +/- 26 g/m2); moreover, in 12 of 30 patients, left ventricular mass normalization was achieved. Drug withdrawal was followed by an increase in blood pressure without left ventricular mass modification. In the total study population, only high-frequency power was higher after lisinopril treatment. In the subgroup of patients with left ventricular mass normalization, daytime and nighttime high-frequency powers as well as nighttime total and very-low-frequency powers were higher after 1 year of treatment than at baseline. In the remaining 18 patients, power spectral measures after treatment were slightly lower than at baseline and were even lower after drug withdrawal. Thus, in hypertensive hypertrophic patients, lisinopril treatment improves sympathovagal imbalance when left ventricular mass normalization is achieved. In patients without left ventricular mass normalization, drug withdrawal is followed by a worsening of neural cardiac control.", 
    "541": "To evaluate the association between skeletal muscle mineral balance and effect of antihypertensive treatment, 37 patients with essential hypertension, randomly treated with either lisinopril or bendrofluazide, were investigated with skeletal muscle biopsies before and after 6 months of treatment. The ratio between calcium and magnesium concentrations in skeletal muscle prior to treatment predicted the blood pressure response during active treatment (r = -0.38, P < .02). During treatment the change in blood pressure was related to the change in muscle Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0.35, P < .05), especially in the patients treated with lisinopril. Thus, an association between the calcium and magnesium balance in skeletal muscle and the blood pressure response to antihypertensive treatment was found in the present study.", 
    "542": "The influence of epoprostenol on the pharmacokinetics of drugs administered concurrently to patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) receiving epoprostenol was evaluated as a secondary objective of a Phase II pilot study. A total of 278 blood samples were collected from 30 patients with end-stage CHF receiving conventional therapy alone or conventional therapy plus epoprostenol. Estimates of oral clearance (Cl), volume of distribution, and absorption rate constant of digoxin were generated from plasma digoxin concentrations using nonlinear mixed effects modeling, and the effect of epoprostenol on Cl of digoxin was evaluated by univariate analysis. Additional factors that were evaluated by univariate analysis included age, obesity, time since study entry, cardiac output, concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, concomitant dobutamine, and estimated creatinine clearance. Backward elimination was used to arrive at a final model that included concomitant epoprostenol as a covariate. The final model revealed an approximate 15% decrease in Cl of digoxin in response to short-term administration of epoprostenol that was no longer apparent by the end of the 12-week treatment phase. Simulations revealed that this effect, although statistically significant, would not be clinically significant in most patients; however, the potential exists for short-term elevation of digoxin concentrations in response to concurrent administration of epoprostenol.", 
    "543": "Hypertension is one of the most important accelerating factors for progression of nephropathies. Its prevalence is about 35% in patients with nephropathies, even in minor or medium severe functional impairment. This is evidence that it is essential to select an optimal therapeutic regimen as soon as possible. A group of 38 patients (14 hypertensive patients) with a minor or medium severe functional impairment were included in a controlled trial. The patients were served a low-protein diet--0.6-0.7 g/kg/day and 2-10mg enalapril/day divided into two doses. The amount of enalapril depended on the blood pressure and enalapril was given also to normotensive patients. The investigation lasted 8 months. In the course of 8 months the authors did not reveal progression of the renal disease, as apparent from results of assessment of the creatinine level and clearance, assessment of uric acid and urea. The authors did not find deterioration of metabolic acidosis, nor of nephrogenic anaemia. Hypertensive patients had a tendency to deteriorating of insulin sensitivity while in normotensive patients a decline of triacylglycerols, VLDL and rise of HDL was recorded. The total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol level did not change. The authors conclude that the combination of a low-protein diet with ACEI in hypertensive and normotensive patients with mild to medium severe functional disorders inhibits the progression of nephropathies, but in hypertensive patients it does not prevent deterioration of insulin sensitivity.",

After surgical creation of mitral regurgitation, 18 dogs were allocated into replicates according to exercise capacities. One dog in each replicate received placebo, and the other received 0.5 mg/kg of enalapril sid for 9 days and bid thereafter. Exercise tolerance was studied after 10, 19, 52 to 53, and 80 to 81 days, respectively. Finally, the percentage of dogs in each group that survived 357 days was compared. The duration of exercise for dogs in the placebo and enalapril groups did not differ at baseline (P > .1) or after 19 days (P > .1). Dogs that received enalapril had significantly reduced (P < .001) exercise tolerance at day 10, and significantly increased (P = .002) exercise tolerance at days 52 to 53 and 80 to 81 when compared with controls. At 357 days, 22% of dogs receiving placebo were alive, compared with 67% of dogs receiving enalapril; however, these differences were not statistically significant (P = .124). This study shows that enalapril increases exercise tolerance in dogs with left-sided heart failure induced by iatrogenic mitral regurgitation.",

We have investigated the effect of trichlormethiazide and captopril on NO synthase (NOS) activity and glomerular damage in the kidney of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. DOCA-salt rats were induced with weekly injections of DOCA (30 mg/kg body weight (BW) and 1% saline in drinking water after right nephrectomy. As antihypertensive therapies, CAP (captopril, 40 mg/kg BW) and TCM (trichlormethiazide, 10 mg/kg BW) were given after induction of DOCA-salt hypertension. The increased blood pressure was significantly lowered by TCM, but not by CAP after 5 weeks. Nitrite production in kidney slices was suppressed in DOCA-salt rats, and immunoreactivity for both brain-type NOS (B-NOS) in macula densa and endothelial-type NOS (EC-NOS) in renal vessels was decreased. TCM significantly increased the nitrite production in the kidney slices and B-NOS immunoreactivity, whereas these changes were less in CAP. Glomerulosclerosis score was significantly higher in DOCA-salt rats, and TCM ameliorated renal damage more effectively than CAP. These results indicate that the reduced nitrite production in the kidney of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was increased more effectively by trichlormethiazide than by captopril, via increased immunoreactivity for B-NOS in the macula densa, and prevented renal damage.",

Musca ACE removed C-terminal dipeptides from angiotensin I, bradykinin [Leu5]enkephalin and [Met5]enkephalin and also functioned as an endopeptidase by hydrolysing dipeptideamides from [Leu5]enkephalinamide and [Met5]enkephalinamide, and a dipeptideamide and a tripeptideamide from substance P. Musca ACE was also able to cleave a tripeptide from both the N-terminus and C-terminus of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, with C-terminal hydrolysis predominating. Maximal N-terminal tripeptidase activity occurred at 150 mM NaCl, whereas the C-terminal tripeptidase activity continued to rise with increasing concentration of Cl- (0-0.5 M).

    "557": "Even though therapeutic advances have occurred, heart failure is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have proven effective, but in many patients still do not prevent progressive and debilitating heart failure. Many hormonal factors are involved, but two, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) axis and the autonomic nervous system, apparently are critical in the pathophysiology of progressive ventricular dysfunction. Pharmacologic suppression of the RAA system is associated with significant clinical benefit, suggesting that antagonism of sympathetic nervous activity with beta-receptor-blocking agents might also be efficacious. Major alterations of the autonomic nervous system are characteristic of heart failure, with excessive sympathetic activity one of the earliest adaptations to the condition, and important in promoting the heart failure state and the progression of ventricular dysfunction. Certain beta-antagonists administered by careful and slow up-titration from small starting dosages proved effective in small trials. Large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled studies continue to document that beta-blockers improve ventricular function and symptoms, and preliminary results suggests mortality and morbidity reductions as well. Although intolerance to beta-antagonism does occur, the majority of patients can be successfully treated with these agents.", 
    "558": "Heart failure is a severe, disabling disease that portends a short life expectancy. This grave prognosis may be explained by growth-promoting effects of angiotensin II implicated in heart failure that mediate a genetic response called programmed cell death. The effects of angiotensin II are inhibited by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which improve exercise performance and quality of life, attenuate disease progression, and modestly lengthen survival. Unfortunately, mortality remains exceedingly high and may be partly attributable to augmented production of angiotensin II from a non-ACE chymase pathway. Angiotensin II production may therefore increase despite treatment with ACE inhibitors. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists are a new class of nonpeptide-reversible inhibitors that may offer clinical promise in heart failure through blockade of angiotensin II actions, whether produced from ACE or non-ACE chymase pathways.", 
    "559": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used for more than a decade in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. In recent years these agents have been used in patients who survived a myocardial infarction. However, primary care providers are often confused as to which patients would benefit the most, and as a result, these life-prolonging drugs are underutilized. The results of randomized controlled trials evaluating ACE inhibitors' effect on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction were evaluated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors clearly improve survival in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. This survival benefit is approximately 6 months. In patients with asymptomatic systolic dysfunction, these agents also decrease the number of hospital admissions due to heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also improve survival in all patients who experienced an acute myocardial infarction. With the plethora of evidence regarding the positive effects that this class of drugs has on the quality of life and survival of patients with systolic dysfunction, it is still unclear why clinicians are reluctant to use them more often. Primary care providers need to be educated on how to risk stratify patients to make this therapy more cost effective, and when these agents should be started.",

Which patients should initially be treated with digoxin remains to be determined. The effects of digoxin on mortality in patients who are receiving ACE inhibitors must also be established.", 
    "561": "In congestive heart failure captopril modifies the left ventricular filling pattern mainly by unloading the heart. We investigated whether the structural characteristics of the left ventricle may influence the acute effects of captopril on this pattern in patients with untreated hypertensive (H group, 6 patients) or idiopathic (I group, 14 patients) cardiomyopathy. We evaluated changes of pulsed Doppler mitral flow, of systemic arterial and wedge pulmonary pressures 40 min after 25 mg captopril administered sublingually, and correlated these changes with the M-mode echocardiographic relative wall thickness index (h/r). Baseline mean arterial pressure (H = 137 +/- 20 mm Hg, mean +/- SD, I = 95 +/- 19 mm Hg; p < 0.001), and h/r (H = 0.38 +/- 0.03, I = 0.28 +/- 0.09; p < 0.05) were greater in the high blood pressure group; wedge pressure, echocardiographic biplane ejection fraction, and Doppler indexes of the left ventricular filling were similar in the two populations. After captopril, ejection fraction did not change significantly, mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in hypertensive patients (H group, baseline = 137 +/- 20, captopril = 119 +/- 10, p = 0.02; I group, baseline = 95 +/- 19, captopril = 90 +/- 24, p = nonsignificant), and the wedge pressure was reduced by the same extent in both groups (H group, baseline = 27.7 +/- 3, captopril = 21 +/- 7, p < 0.05; I group, baseline = 20 +/- 12, captopril = 15 +/- 8, p < 0.05). In the H group early mitral flow increased [(E wave integral) x (mitral annulus area)] by 38 +/- 15%, and was almost steady in the I group (-1.3 +/- 30%; group H vs. I = p < 0.01); late mitral flow [(A wave integral) x (mitral annulus area)] showed a pattern exactly opposite to this (H = +0.4 +/- 40%, I = +38 +/- 19; p < 0.01). In the whole population there was a significant correlation between the early/late flow ratio variations and baseline h/r (r = 0.6, p < 0.05). In chronic congestive heart failure, changes in left ventricular filling with captopril are related to h/r: a higher index, as recorded in the H group, is associated with \"true normalization' of the filling pattern after captopril; a lower index, as recorded in the I group, is associated with \"pseudonormalization' despite a similar decrease of left ventricular filling pressure.",

    "563": "The effects of the ACE inhibitor spirapril and of hydrochlorothiazide on left ventricular diastolic function were studied. Thirteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension completed this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study. After a three-week run-in period the patients entered three periods lasting four weeks each, wherein they were treated with placebo, spirapril, or hydrochlorothiazide. Blood pressure, hemodynamic variables (stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, index of contractility, and systemic vascular resistance), echocardiography (left ventricular mass), and Doppler-derived atrial to early (A/E)-ratio velocity time integrals (VTI) were measured at the end of each of the four periods. Spirapril lowered the A/E-ratio VTIs (0.57, 0.12-1.00) (P < 0.02) as compared with both placebo (0.80, 0.50-2.67) and hydrochlorothiazide (0.83, 0.44-1.25), and the drug normalized the A/E-ratio VTI in those patients with elevated values. The hemodynamic variables, left ventricular mass, and end-systolic wall stress were unchanged during all three treatments. There were no significant changes in mean blood pressure during the treatment periods. These results indicate that spirapril lowers A/E ratio within four weeks in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. It thereby seems able to improve left ventricular diastolic function. The effect is not dependent upon changes in hemodynamic variables, blood pressure, left ventricular mass, or end-systolic wall stress.", 
    "564": "Central serotonin (5-HT) and angiotensin (ANG II) stimulate arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin (OT), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion and increase blood pressure. Studies were conducted in conscious rats to determine whether neuroendocrine activation by 5-HT requires a brain angiotensinergic intermediate pathway. In the first study, ANG II formation was inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril before injection of the 5-HT releaser/uptake inhibitor d-fenfluramine. Fenfluramine (2 mg/kg ip) stimulated AVP, OT, corticosterone, and prolactin (PRL) secretion (P<0.01). Enalapril (60 mg/l in drinking water for 4 days and 10 mg/kg ip 2 h before the rats were killed) inhibited only the AVP response (P<0.01) to d-fenfluramine. In the second study, the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist LY-53857 (10 microgram), or the ANG II AT1 antagonist DuP-753 (10 microgram), on intracerebroventricular 5-HT (10 microgram)-stimulated AVP, OT, ACTH, PRL, renin secretion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) was tested. LY-53857 inhibited the AVP, OT, and ACTH responses to 5-HT (P<0.01), whereas DuP-753 inhibited only the AVP response (P<0.01). Intraventricular injection of 5-HT increased MAP and decreased HR. The MAP response was not affected by LY-53857 or DuP-753, and at no time did MAP decline below starting levels. The decreased HR was inhibited by LY-53857 but not by DuP-753. These results demonstrate that 5-HT-induced AVP secretion is mediated selectively via brain angiotensinergic mechanisms by way of the AT1 receptor.", 
    "565": "Nitrovasodilators, such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP), release nitric oxide (NO) and stimulate intestinal electrolyte transport. However, the second messengers involved in this process are unknown. NO stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase activity in other tissues, but stimulation of this enzyme has not previously been described for intestine. We report a 20-fold increase in guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) production by radioimmunoassay in colonic mucosal strips stimulated with SNP. SNP also caused a significant increase in prostaglandin (PG) E2 release but did not stimulate release of the prostanoids thromboxane B2 or 6-keto-PGF1alpha. Stimulation of isolated colonic crypts and the remaining subepithelial mucosa demonstrated that the latter was the major source of the increases in cGMP and PGE2. Immunostaining of colonic mucosa revealed minimal basal cGMP immunoreactivity but large increases in abundance, localizing to the subepithelium, after SNP treatment. Under basal conditions, there was diffuse immunostaining for constitutive NO synthase in both the epithelial and subepithelial compartments, which was corroborated with NADPH diaphorase staining. In conclusion, SNP was an NO donor stimulates production of cGMP and PGE2 from the subepithelium. NO may be an important mediator of colonic secretion and other processes predominantly via its direct effects on cells of the lamina propria.", 
    "566": "Endothelin (ET) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide which is elevated in plasma in congestive heart failure. Recent studies suggest an important role for angiotensin II (AII) in the activation of ET in cultured cardiomyocytes. Chronic thoracic inferior vena caval constriction (TIVCC) is a model of reduced cardiac output that mimics the neurohumoral activation observed in congestive heart failure. We hypothesized that activation of the renin-angiotensin system in TIVCC plays a role in the activation of ET and that the elevation of endogenous ET contributes to the systemic and renal vasoconstriction that characterizes this model of venous congestion. We studied conscious dogs after 7 d of TIVCC in the presence or absence of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril. TIVCC resulted in marked activation of plasma AII and ET in plasma, right atrium, lung, and renal medulla which was further localized to cardiomyocytes, pulmonary, and renal epithelial cells. Chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition abolished the increases in plasma AII and ET during TIVCC. Acute endothelin A receptor blockade with FR-139317 resulted in significant decreases in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance in TIVCC. We conclude that activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the activation of circulating and local ET in TIVCC and that this activation plays an important role in the regulation of arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance in this model of congestive failure.",

    "572": "This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study designed to determine the influence of digitalis treatment on left ventricular (LV) response to physical exercise in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In 10 patients with CHF (ejection fraction 29 +/- 2%), LV function was assessed during upright bicycle exercise using an ambulatory radionuclide detector for continuous noninvasive monitoring of cardiac function. Exercise was performed during control conditions and after a 3-week treatment with digoxin (0.25 mg/day orally) or placebo. Ten normal volunteers matched for sex and age constituted the control group. In normals, exercise ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume increased (both p <0.001), while end-systolic volume decreased progressively (p <0.001). In control conditions, patients with CHF had a sharp increase in heart rate during exercise, while ejection fraction did not change; both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased significantly (both p <0.001) during exercise. During digoxin treatment, heart rate response to exercise recorded in patients with CHF was comparable to that recorded in normal subjects. In addition, a significant increase in ejection fraction during exercise was detected (P <0.001), and the increase in end-systolic volume was significantly smaller than that observed in control conditions (p <0.05). When patients received placebo, the responses of LV function to exercise were comparable to those observed in control conditions. These findings demonstrate that digitalis has a favorable influence on LV functional adaptation to exercise in CHF.", 
    "573": "We studied the mechanisms responsible for vascular and cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension (pressure load and humoral and genetic factors) in two experimental approaches: (1) We carried out a cosegregation analysis to correlate cardiac and vascular hypertrophy with subphenotypes of blood pressure in an F2 generation of a cross between stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats; (2) we treated 8-week-old SHRSP with perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; losartan, an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist; or perindopril combined with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor to investigate the relative contributions of blood pressure and angiotensin II to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and vascular smooth muscle polyploidy. Vascular smooth muscle polyploidy was measured with flow cytometry DNA analysis. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by measuring the ratios of heart weight to body weight and left ventricle + septum weight to body weight. Blood pressure was measured with radiotelemetry in the F2 cosegregation experiment and with tail-cuff plethysmography in the pharmacological study. In the F2 rats, the best predictor of smooth muscle polyploidy by ANCOVA was systolic pressure (F=29.28, P < .0001). The ratio of left ventricle + septum weight to body weight had four major predictors: the male progenitor of the cross, sex, pulse pressure, and change in systolic pressure during salt (F=43.67, P < .0001; F=16.37, P < .0001; F=8.41, P=.0022; and F=12.39, P= .0003, respectively). The ratio of heart weight to body weight had similar predictors. In the pharmacological study, treatment with losartan alone, perindopril alone, or perindopril in combination with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester prevented the development of smooth muscle polyploidy and cardiac hypertrophy. The prevention of cardiac hypertrophy was most marked in the SHRSP treated with perindopril plus N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, despite blood pressure being higher in this group than in the two other treatment groups. We conclude that vascular and cardiac hypertrophy in this form of hypertension are regulated by different variables. However, suppression of the action of angiotensin II lessens hypertrophy of both types of muscle.", 
    "574": "To examine whether endothelial dysfunction in hypertension is reversible or not, we studied the effects of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on nitric oxide release in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. After a 4-week treatment with imidapril (1 or 10 mg/d SC) or vehicle, acetylcholine-induced vasodilation and nitric oxide release in the isolated kidneys were determined. Nitric oxide release was measured by a chemiluminescense assay. Imidapril lowered blood pressure in stroke-prone SHR in a dose-dependent manner. Untreated stroke-prone SHR exhibited significantly attenuated responses to acetylcholine (10(-8) mol/L) of both renal perfusion pressure (stroke-prone SHE 42 +/- 4% versus Wistar-Kyoto rats [WKY] 58 +/- 4% [mean +/- SE], P < .01) and nitric oxide release (stroke-prone SHR +7.6 +/- 2.1 versus WKY +29.7 +/- 9.7 fmol/min per gram of kidney wt, P < .01). Imidapril at 10 mg/d significantly increased acetylcholine-induced renal vasodilation and nitric oxide release in stroke-prone SHR (renal perfusion pressure, 56 +/- 3%; nitric oxide release, +27.1 +/- 6.4 fmol/min per gram of kidney wt; both P < .01 versus stroke-prone SHR treated with vehicle). On the other hand, imidapril neither decreased blood pressure nor changed nitric oxide release induced by acetylcholine in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Staining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase and brain nitric oxide synthase was clearly detected in the kidneys of both stroke-prone SHR and WKY, whereas staining intensity was weaker in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Inducible nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity was barely noticeable in any type of rat. Thus, imidapril restored endothelial damage by pressure-dependent mechanisms. Most of the nitric oxide detected in the perfusate seemed to be derived from constitutive nitric oxide synthase.",

    "580": "Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to inhibit intimal hyperplasia after balloon dilation of noncoronary arteries in small-animal models, suggesting an important role for Ang II in the response to injury. Although ACE inhibitors have not been similarly effective in nonhuman coronary models or in human restenosis trials, questions remain regarding the efficacy ACE inhibitors against tissue ACE and the contributions of ACE-independent pathways of Ang II generation. Unlike ACE inhibitors, Ang II receptor antagonists have the potential to inhibit responses to Ang II independent of its biosynthetic origin.", 
    "581": "In separate studies, three Ang II receptor antagonists, including AT1 selective (L-158,809), balanced AT1/AT2 (L-163,082), and AT2 selective (L-164,282) agents, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit vascular intimal thickening in a porcine coronary artery model of vascular injury. Preliminary studies in a rat carotid artery model revealed that constant infusion of L-158,809 (0.3 or 1.0 mg X kg-1 X d-1) reduced the neointimal cross-sectional area by up to 37% measured 14 days after balloon dilatation. In the porcine studies, animals were treated with vehicle or test compound beginning 2 days before and extending 28 days after experimental angioplasty. Left anterior descending, left circumflex, and/or right coronary arteries were injured by inflation of commercially available angioplasty balloons with placement of coiled metallic stents. Infusion of L-158,809 (1 mg X kg-1 X d-1), L-163,082 (1 mg X kg-1 X d-1), or L-164,282 (1.5 mg X kg-1 X d-1) in the study animals yielded plasma drug levels sufficient either to chronically block or, for L-164,282, to spare pressor responses to exogenous Ang II. Neither L-158,809, L-163,082, nor L-164,282 had statistically significant effects (P=.12, P=.75, and P=.48, respectively, compared with vehicle-treated controls) on neointimal thickness (normalized for degree of injury) measured by morphometric analysis at day 28 after angioplasty.", 
    "582": "These findings indicate that chronic blockade of Ang II receptors by either site-selective or balanced AT1/AT2 antagonists is insufficient to inhibit intimal hyperplasia after experimental coronary vascular injury in the pig. The results further suggest that, unlike in the rat carotid artery, Ang II is not a major mediator of intimal thickening in the pig coronary artery.", 
    "583": "Rats with myocardial infarction provide a clinically relevant model for hemodynamic and survival studies. Moreover, behavioral changes in this model, i.e. increased anxiety and reduced interest in environment and social interactions, mimic aspects of the reduced quality of life of patients. In the present study, we investigated whether pharmacological treatment that is known to improve hemodynamics and prognosis could also affect the behavioral changes associated with quality of life. Rats with 3-week-old infarcts were treated with intermittent dobutamine (1 mg/kg i.p., twice daily) or captopril (2 milligrams in drinking water). After 2 weeks of treatment, when from previous studies hemodynamics are expected to be restored, behavioral tests were performed. In the free exploration test, which primarily evaluates exploratory behavior, dobutamine normalized the reduced interest in the environment. In the standard open field and social interaction tests, which also include an anxiety component, the beneficial effects of dobutamine were not observed. In contrast, captopril normalized all behavioral changes that indicated increased anxiety. In conclusion, the expected similar hemodynamic improvement with dobutamine and captopril treatment resulted in improvement of different aspects of the changed behavior of rats with myocardial infarction, indicating that there is no direct relationship between hemodynamics and quality of life. The behavioral tests used, in combination with our previously described functional hemodynamic measurements, could provide a new basis for evaluating the effects of therapy on hemodynamic function as well as the quality of life.",

    "586": "After 4 years, women who were randomized to lifestyle intervention only were less likely to be receiving step 1 therapy alone (placebo) than men who were randomized to placebo therapy (46% vs 66%, respectively, P < .01). There were significantly greater decreases in the mean systolic blood pressure in both men and women who were assigned to treatment with active drugs compared with those participants who were receiving placebo therapy; differences among treatments with active drugs were similar between men and women. Men experienced larger falls in their total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels regardless of the treatment assignment than did women; however, there were no significant sex-by-treatment interactions. Quality-of-life indexes were generally improved with active drug treatment compared with placebo therapy in both sexes; there was a sex-by-treatment interaction for the general health index. The relative risk (RR) for combined clinical events was similar in women (RR, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], (0.36 to 1.16) and in men (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.14) who were assigned to treatment with all active drugs combined, compared with those who were receiving placebo therapy.",

    "588": "Nephropathy affects about one third of diabetic patients and its onset can be predicted almost a decade in advance by detecting small quantities of albumin in the urine (microalbuminuria). Thus, detection of proteinuria or microalbuminuria in diabetic patients carries important implications and merits intervention. Strategies for delaying the relentless progression of microalbuminuria to diabetic nephropathy and ultimately end-stage renal failure are focused on improving glycemic control and reducing blood pressure. Studies with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertensive diabetics with microalbuminuria have shown a significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion rates (AER), with effective lowering of blood pressure. In a crossover study, we compared the effects of captopril versus indapamide as monotherapy for 12 weeks on AER and blood pressure in 31 diabetic patients with established microalbuminuria. The 2 drugs were equally effective in reducing AER (average reduction 30-40%) and had comparable antihypertensive effects.", 
    "589": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and beta-blockers prevent, and cause regression of, left ventricular hypertrophy after short-term therapy. The ability of diuretics to do the same is unclear. We have performed a meta-analysis of studies documenting the effect on left ventricular mass of 6 months' treatment with 2.5 mg indapamide daily. Six studies comprising 197 patients, aged 20-75 years, were included. There was an overall mean reduction in left ventricular mass index of 13.3%, which was principally due to a reduction in left ventricular wall thickness rather than internal diameter.", 
    "590": "Left-ventricular hypertrophy is the result of cardiac adaptation to global or regional overstress and represents an important cardiovascular risk factor, increasing the risk for development of congestive heart failure and incidence of sudden death. This review describes the pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in the development of left-ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis with particular emphasis on the role of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Central to the cascade of cardiac fibrosis is the increased production or reduced degradation of collagen proteins in fibroblasts. Collagen proteins are proteins needed for the alignment of cellular compartments and the development of forces, contraction and relaxation of the heart. If overexpressed, an important rise of wall stiffness is observed in addition to a reduced capacity to provide oxygen to the cardiac tissue. This latter explains why in areas of histologically hypertrophied heart muscle atrophied muscle cells are observed. The characterization of the second-messenger systems involved in the regulation of cardiac cells as well as the identification of angiotensin-II receptor subtype and angiotensin IV is described. Both of these receptors are present on cardiac fibroblasts and stimulate these to collagen production, which can be inhibited by antagonists or the generation of angiotensin II by ACE inhibitors. In some forms of left-ventricular hypertrophy and in patients with congestive heart failure in addition to elevated angiotensin-II levels, increased aldosterone levels are observed. Aldosterone raises upon stimulation by angiotensin II and upon reduction of angiotensin-II generation subsequent to ACE inhibition through an escape mechanism. The contribution of aldosterone to left-ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis can be prevented and reduced by the administration of its antagonist, spironolactone. Further and larger clinical trials are needed and in progress to evaluate if the combination of an ACE inhibitor with spironolactone potentiates the reduction of left-ventricular hypertrophy and if this translates in a reduction of the cardiovascular risk.", 
    "591": "In Germany approximately 88,000 people died as a result of acute myocardial infarction and approximately 300,000 people suffered from acute myocardial infarction in 1992. These data demonstrate the socioeconomic impact of coronary disease. In the SAVE-(Survival-and-Ventricular-Enlargement) study, Pfeffer et al. demonstrated a reduction of morbidity and mortality due to therapy with captopril in patients after myocardial infarction. In a retrospective, incremental cost-effectiveness-analysis, from the perspective of German statutory insurance fund, the economic impact of captopril after myocardial infarction has been analysed.", 
    "592": "The basis for the economic evaluation has been the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical SAVE-study which included 2,231 patients having left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction. Additional data e.g. average number of hospital days or average costs for hospitalisation per day was taken from published national statistical sources. In the cost-effectiveness-analysis, inputs (monetary units) and outputs (non-monetary units) were identified and measured. The cost-effectiveness (costs per life-year gained) demonstrates a relation between the costs of captopril-treatment, costs for myocardial infarction and costs for leftventricular insuffiency and the clinical benefit e.g. life years gained.", 
    "593": "Initially costs in the captopril-group are 3.7 Mio DM higher as in the placebo-group. But these costs are partly compensated by the cost reductions in the captopril-group, compared to the placebo-group (2,162,901 DM) the reduction of myocardial infarction and DM 556,518 cost reduction due to fewer patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The clinical benefit of the captopril treatment equals 495 life years gained. The cost-effectiveness-ratio is 2,000 DM cost for life year gained.",

Duration of diabetes, blood pressure values, and metabolic status are the major determinants of the course of nephropathy, and microalbuminuria is the hallmark of its onset. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors offer important renoprotection to hypertensive and normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our study extends previous observations for duration and the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on advanced nephropathy.", 
    "596": "Double-blinded (first phase) and open (second phase) randomized controlled study of 7 years. Ninety-four normotensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus whose serum creatinine levels were lower than 123.76 mumol/L (1.4 mg/dL) and who had microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/24 h) were given enalapril maleate, 10 mg/d, or placebo, for 5 years. For 2 more years they were followed up openly and given the choice to receive enalapril or no treatment.",

An increase from (mean +/- SD) 123 +/- 58 to 310 +/- 167 mg/24 h occurred in the untreated group after 5 years, and a further increase to (mean +/- SD) 393 +/- 223 mg/24 h occurred after 7 years. Reciprocal creatinine was unchanged in treated patients for 7 years; in the untreated patients, the mean decline was 13% at 5 years and 16% at 7 years. Treatment with enalapril resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 42% for nephropathy to develop during 7 years (95% confidence interval, 15% to 69%; P < .001, Student's t test). Glycosylated hemoglobin and body mass index remained unchanged.", 
    "598": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition offers long-term protection against the development of nephropathy in normotensive patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who have microalbuminuria, and it stabilizes renal function in previously untreated patients with impaired renal function. Discontinuation of treatment results in renewed progression of nephropathy.", 
    "599": "The renin-angiotensin system, through the effects of angiotensin II, may be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension and associated left ventricular hypertrophy. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) lowers blood pressure and reduces left ventricular hypertrophy. ACEI, however, may not completely inhibit the production of angiotensin II and its effects, and adverse effects like cough and rise in creatinine have been associated with ACEI and reduced degradation of bradykinin. The first selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1) receptor, losartan, has recently been approved. The LIFE study has been started, in which 8,300 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy in Scandinavia and the USA will be randomized to blinded treatment with either atenolol or losartan to compare the effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over a period of five years.", 
    "600": "Possible involvement of cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in pressure overload induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was investigated. Rats were subjected to abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) and examined the effects of 4 weeks treatments with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril and a vasodilator, hydralazine on haemodynamics and ventricular RNA, DNA, protein and myosin isoform pattern in sham and hypertrophied rats. AAC increased the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP), and resulted in increased left ventricle/body weight ratio, LV thickness, RNA and protein content, however total DNA was not changed. The expression of fetal isogene, beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), was markedly enhanced where as alpha-MHC was reduced. High-dose captopril (100 mg/kg p.o.,) significantly prevented the increase in haemodynamics, development of LVH, LV remodeling, increase in total protein, RNA and antithetical expression of myosin isoforms. Hydralazine (15 mg/kg p.o.,), did not modulate hypertrophic changes and low-dose captopril (1.5 mg/kg p.o.,) which has not produced any marked fall in MAP and SBP also modulated favourably the development of LVH and its biochemical markers. Thus, the prevention of the development of LVH and induction of beta-MHC by non-hypotensive doses of captopril may be related to the blockade of intracardiac production of angiotensin II rather than circulating system. These results suggest that cardiac RAS may play an important role in pressure overload induced LVH.", 
    "601": "Because heart failure is common and disabling, patients with this condition utilise healthcare resources to a considerable extent. In particular, patients with heart failure frequently require hospital admission, and inpatient care is often protracted. Patients with the most advanced stages of heart failure make the greatest demands on the healthcare system. Expenditure related to the consumption of healthcare resources accounts for the 1 to 2% of total healthcare spending related to heart failure. Between two-thirds and three-quarters of this is due to the costs of hospital care. ACE inhibitors reduce progression of heart failure and also reduce the need for hospitalisation by approximately 30%. In so doing, these drugs substantially or totally offset their cost and the cost of extended life. Five independent economic analyses collectively show ACE inhibitors, at worst, to be very cost effective (in comparison to other cardiovascular therapies), cost neutral or to lead to overall cost savings when used to treat heart failure.", 
    "602": "Heart failure is at the same time a muscular and a neurohormonal disease. This explains the current therapeutic choices: in particular digitalis, ACE inhibitors, spironolactone and in certain patients even beta-blocking agents. Two different types of heart failure are distinguished today: systolic failure with pump failure and diastolic failure with deranged ventricular filling. In the elderly, the two entities occur either together or individually. A precise and early diagnosis is important for an appropriate treatment to be instituted as early as possible, even in the case of asymptomatic or subclinical heart failure.", 
    "603": "These experiments compare the effects of a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, retrothiorphan, 1-[(1-mercaptomethyl-2-phenyl)ethyl]amino-1-oxopropanoic acid, a converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, and the combination of the two inhibitors on changes in blood pressure and renal function induced by exogenous and endogenous bradykinin in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rats. Enalaprilat potentiated the exogenous bradykinin-induced hypotensive responses while retrothiorphan potentiated the effects on urinary cyclic-GMP (cGMP) and bradykinin. The combination potentiated the exogenous bradykinin-induced hypotensive effects and the bradykinin-induced urinary excretion of cGMP, bradykinin and prostaglandin. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140, had no effect on the enalaprilat- and retrothiorphan-induced changes in blood pressure and renal function. In conclusion, while angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase are involved in the vascular and renal catabolism of exogenous bradykinin, the effects of the peptidase inhibitors do not appear to depend on the protection of endogenous bradykinin under acute conditions in DOCA-salt rats.", 
    "604": "Myocardial infarction represents a crossroads in the natural history of coronary artery disease. The prognosis is determined by the severity of coronary artery disease, infarct size (and hence ejection fraction), and age of the patient. After infarction, patients may remain symptomless, or suffer angina, silent ischemia, reinfarction, heart failure or sudden death. Hence patient management after infarction includes (1) estimation of risk, (2) the use of stress tests to detect ischemia and rhythm disorders, (3) PTCA or bypass if required and (4) medical therapy. Cardiac catheterization is indicated in patients with angina or silent ischemia, non-Q wave infarction or large infarctus; its use is less well established in patients without ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction, but this indication is nevertheless increasingly accepted. PTCA is primarily utilized in patients with single or two vessel disease, while coronary bypass surgery is indicated in patients with left main or three vessel disease. All these measures are designed to improve symptoms and prognosis. For secondary prevention medical therapy should be used to treat cardiovascular risk factors (antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs etc.), to inhibit platelets (aspirin, ticlopidine) or coagulation (coumarins), to block neurohumoral activation (betablocker, ACE-inhibitors), for vasoconstriction (calcium channel blockers, nitrates) and to suppress arrhythmias. The large number of drugs requires reasoned use depending on the risk profile of the individual patient. Cardiovascular risk factors should be treated appropriately. Platelet inhibitors should be given to all patients except those with atrial fibrillation or large ventricles (coumarins). Betablockers reduce mortality, reinfarction and sudden death after infarction and hence should be used if no contraindications exist. ACE-inhibitors are particularly effective in improving symptoms and prognosis in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Calcium antagonists should be used with caution and only in patients with normal left ventricular function. Nitrates are primarily effective in improving symptoms in patients with angina or heart failure. Antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone) are only useful in patients with complex arrhythmias. Digitalis has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with heart failure, while other inotropic drugs are virtually no longer used. These guidelines allow reasoned differential therapy after myocardial infarction to the maximum benefit of the patient and at minimum cost.",

Of 85 evaluable, nine developed life-threatening CHF at 1.5 to 13 months after ending epirubicin. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from normal to 18 to 35%. All received frusemide and digoxin, and then, after transient clinical relief, enalapril or ramipril (initially 1.25 mg orally daily, increasing to 10-15 mg after 4-6 weeks).", 
    "607": "Eight of the nine patients deteriorated while on digoxin/diuretic. Within 3 months of starting the ACE inhibitor in these patients, LVEF had increased to normal or near normal. Only one patient died in heart failure. Follow-up ranged from 11 to 42 months (median 26). The ACE inhibitor was well-tolerated, with no first-dose hypotension, except for one patient who discontinued treatment after 6 months because of persistent cough. Two others discontinued treatment with their ACE inhibitor after 22 and 28 months because they felt well. Survival in the nine patients was similar to that of those who did not develop CHF.", 
    "608": "Our experience suggests that treatment of anthracycline-induced CHF with an ACE inhibitor should start soon after clinical improvement on digoxin/diuretic regardless of the severity of symptoms rather than waiting for clinical deterioration.", 
    "609": "Patients with hypertension can be treated by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). A major side-effect of the use of ACE-inhibitors is the development of a life threatening dyspneu by angioedema of oropharyngeal and laryngeal tissue. This severe complication is caused by interaction of ACE-inhibitors with prostaglandin and bradykinin metabolisms. Minor manifestations of angioedema can be followed by severe reactions. It is wise to stop ACE-inhibitors immediately.", 
    "610": "The effect of chronic captopril therapy on serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was studied in 30 patients with essential hypertension. Patients were assessed for serum ACE levels serially every week for 4 weeks. Thirty healthy individuals served as controls. The basal serum ACE level among hypertensives (57.4 +/- 37.2 u/l) was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the controls (33.3 +/- 8.8 u/l). One week after starting captopril therapy, serum ACE levels fell to almost half the basal values (p < 0.001). However, thereafter, it rose to levels higher than the basal level even though the blood pressure remained well controlled. Our study suggests that besides its action on ACE, captopril may lower the blood pressure by other mechanisms as well.",

The clinical aspects indicating ventricular disfunction are presented and several pharmacological effects which have been proposed for the prevention of this situation. Particular emphasis is given to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the prevention of left ventricular disfunction after acute myocardial infarctions, based on the most recent clinical trials.", 
    "612": "Outcomes research seeks to identify effective evidence-based methods of providing the best medical care. While randomized clinical trials (RCT) usually provide the clearest answers, they are often not done or not practicable. More than a decade after the introduction of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, clinical trial data about their effect on major disease endpoints in patients with hypertension are still not available. The primary alternatives are the use of randomized trials that include surrogate endpoints, such as level of blood pressure or extent of carotid atherosclerosis, and the use of observational studies that include major disease endpoints. Both approaches, their strengths and limitations, are discussed in detail. The possibility of residual confounding limits the strength of inferences that can be drawn from observational studies. Similarly, the possibility of important drug effects, other than those involving the surrogate endpoint, limits the inferences that can be drawn from randomized trials that rely solely on surrogate outcomes as guides to therapy. In the absence of evidence from large clinical trials that include major disease endpoints, treatment decisions and guidelines need to synthesize the best available information from a variety of sources. Consistency of findings across various study designs, outcomes, and populations is critical to the practice of evidence-based medicine and the effort to maximize the health benefits of antihypertensive therapies.", 
    "613": "In anesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea pigs, infusion of captopril (1 mg/kg/h), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, significantly enhanced bronchoconstriction induced by intravenous injection of bradykinin (BK; 0.1-30 nmol/kg). Pretreatment of guinea pigs with capsaicin (100 mu g/kg) slightly suppressed the bronchoconstriction by BK alone and almost all of the enhancement of BK-induced bronchoconstriction by captopril was suppressed. Intravenous injection of substance P (SP; 0.1-100 nmol/kg), neurokinin A (NKA; 0.1-30 nmol/kg) and neurokinin B (NKB; 0.1-30 nmol/kg) also induced dose-dependent bronchoconstriction but captopril treatment enhanced only the bronchoconstriction induced by SP. BK degradation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in vitro was significantly suppressed by captopril (p < 0.05). Captopril infusion to guinea pigs significantly increased the levels of BK, SP, and NKA in BALF after BK injection (p < 0.05). FK224, an NK1 and NK2 receptor antagonist and SR 48968, an NK2 receptor antagonist, significantly suppressed the bronchoconstriction induced by BK alone (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) as well as the enhancement by captopril (p < 0.01). It can be concluded that the enhancement of BK-induced bronchoconstriction by captopril was attributable to inhibition of the degradation of BK itself and thereby enhanced release of NKA and partly of SP from sensory nerves by BK.", 
    "614": "To investigate the role of kinins in augmentation of insulin sensitivity by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), the effects of ACEI (delapril) on the insulin resistance in fructose-fed rats (FFR) were evaluated with or without the administration of bradykinin receptor antagonist (Hoe 140). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed on fructose rich chow (FFR) or standard chow (control) for 4 weeks and treated with 10 mg/kg/day of delapril with or without Hoe 140 (0.5 mg/kg/day) for an additional 2 weeks. Steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) and steady state plasma insulin (SSPI) were determined while the rats were conscious. Insulin (2.5 mU/kg/min) and glucose (8 mg/kg/min) were simultaneously infused to determine insulin sensitivity in each group. Mean blood pressure (MBP), SSPG and SSPI were significantly higher in FFR than in control, and were significantly lower in the FFR+delapril than in FFR+vehicle. There were no difference in MBP, SSPG and SSPI between FFR+delapril+vehicle and FFR+delapril+Hoe 140. We concluded that the main mechanisms of improving the insulin sensitivity by ACEI may not be the enhancement of kinins but the suppression of angiotensin II in FFR.", 
    "615": "Either calcium channel blocker (CCB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) is used as an antihypertensive agent, and we are recommended to use them in combination to refractory hypertension with evidence dependent on clinical observations. We examined the renal protective effect of the combined therapy with calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) against hypertensive renal injury in 5/6 nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with salt loading, comparing with monotherapy of each drug. Forty males SHRs with 5/6 nephrectomy and salt loading were divided to five groups: group 1 as control (n = 8), group 2 received 0.2 mg/kg/day of amlodipine (n = 8), group 3 received 0.2 mg/kg/day of enalapril (n = 8), group 4 (n = 8) and group 5 (n = 8) that were treated with 0.1 mg/kg/day and 0.2 mg/kg/day of each drug in combination respectively. Either amlodipine or enalapril had remarkable effects on reducing the increases in blood pressure and urinary protein excretion. In histopathological examination, it also suppressed renal injury significantly. Additional significant effect of combined therapy was not observed in blood pressure and urinary protein. There were not remarkable, additional effects of the combination of CCB and ACEi on protecting the remnant kidney in 5/6 nephrectomized SHRs fed a high-salt diet, possibly because sodium retention was not alleviated by the combination.",

Plasma ACE activity in SHRCAP (54.8 +/- 2.1 mU/ml/min) was significantly greater than in SHR (25.96 +/- 0.34 mU/ml/min) and their offspring (OFFCAP, 26.32 +/- 2.71 and 2ndG, 17.62 +/- 2.47 mU/ml/min, P < 0.001, respectively). Plasma level of AVP in SHR (14.18 +/- 0.98 pg/ml) were greater than in SHRCAP (9.1 +/- 1.01 pg/ml, P < 0.01). A decrease in plasma AVP levels were also noted in OFFCAP (10.48 +/- 0.51 pg/ml) and their offspring 2ndG (10.34 +/- 0.46 pg/ml). Our results did not show a relationship between plasma ACE activity and blood pressure reduction. However, treatment of SHR with captopril produced a decrease in plasma AVP levels which may participate in its antihypertensive mechanism of action.", 
    "617": "Results of an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Sweden are presented. The cost per life-year gained decreases with age for both men and women and is relatively low for middle-aged and older men and women even in the blood pressure range 90-94 mmHg. The results indicate that it is in general cost-effective to treat middle-aged and older men and women in Sweden with a diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mmHg, but that it is questionable whether it is in general cost-effective to treat younger men and women with mild hypertension. It is furthermore shown that ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists may be cost-effective in some patient groups at a high risk of coronary heart disease, if they achieve the epidemiologically expected risk reduction for coronary heart disease. Since an improved risk reduction has not been demonstrated in clinical trials ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists cannot, however, at present be recommended for hypertension treatment in any patient groups unless treatment with diuretics and beta-blockers is contraindicated.",

Since some once-daily agents are more effective than others in maintaining antihypertensive effects toward the end of the 24-h dosing interval this study was designed to evaluate the duration of antihypertensive action of trandolapril using 48 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 41 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Twenty-four hour ABPM was performed on two consecutive days (48 h) after a 4 week single blind placebo run-in period and repeated after an 8 week double-blind period during which 20 patients were randomized to treatment with trandolapril (2-4 mg once-daily) and 21 patients to matching placebo. During the second 48 h monitoring period, placebo rather than active medication was taken by both of the groups at the beginning of the second 24 h segment. Trandolapril reduced ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP by 9.4 and 6.2 mm Hg respectively (P < or = 0.01) during the first 24 h of the post treatment monitoring period while placebo increased the systolic and diastolic BPs in the same period by 3.8 and 2.6 mm Hg (P < 0.05). During the second monitoring period (hours 25-48), trandolapril reduced systolic and diastolic BP by 5.6 and 3.9 mm Hg while placebo increased BP by 2.3 and 1.6 mm Hg (P < 0.03). When compared to placebo by 2 h time blocks, throughout the 2 days of monitoring, trandolapril produced clinically significant decreases in systolic and diastolic BP for 30 and 28 h following dosing. This indicates that trandolapril can be considered a true once-daily antihypertensive agent.", 
    "619": "Quality of life (QOL) measures were assessed in a multi-center, double-blind, case-controlled trial of 1 year's duration. A total of 368 hypertensive male patients were randomly assigned to monotherapies of either isradipine, methyldopa or placebo. If normotension was not achieved, captopril was added. QOL assessments in the hypertensives and in 155 normotensives included a self-structured scale to measure the subjective perception of QOL, the severity, desirability and controllability of recent critical life events, semantic memory, physical dysfunction, sleep disorders, sexual difficulties, depression and work-related stress. The overall withdrawal rate during the trial was 19%, mainly due to lack of efficacy and adverse experiences. At baseline, and at the end of the trial, the normotensives as compared to hypertensive patients, had significantly better scores in most QOL measures. Patients treated with the combination of isradipine and captopril reported more favorable changes in the subjective measure of QOL (P < 0.03) and in semantic memory (P < 0.001) than patients treated with any of the monotherapies or with methyldopa in combination with captopril. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for changes of other indices of QOL. In most QOL measurements, normotensives rated better then hypertensives. Patients treated on long-term therapy with the combination of isradipine and captopril showed improvement in self-structured QOL measures and semantic memory, compared to patients treated either with methyldopa or placebo.", 
    "620": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in patients with clinical signs of peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. One hundred patients, mean age 69 years (range 45-88) with symptoms and clinical signs of severe peripheral ischemia, underwent aortography to determine the degree of peripheral vascular disease and possible renal artery stenosis. History of claudication, and measurement of systolic distal blood pressure (BP) and calculation of the Ankle Brachial Index was used to define the severity of peripheral vascular disease. A total of 31% had renal artery stenosis (14% greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter). In a subgroup of patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease (n = 74), 34% had renal artery stenosis. In the subgroup of patients with renal artery stenosis, 81% have hypertension. Patients with renal artery stenosis and lumen reduction of more than 50%, 93% have hypertension (P < or = 0.001). In conclusion this study shows that the combination of peripheral vascular disease and hypertension is an important clinical clue for renovascular disease. Examination for reno-vascular disease in this population should be considered, since the prevalence of the condition is high. Furthermore examination for renal vascular disease in this population is mandatory, before treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is initiated, since treatment might lead to serious renal function impairment.", 
    "621": "In a randomized double blind study, the arterial changes produced either by hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride (Group I), or by hydrochlorothiazide plus captopril (Group II) were investigated in two territories of the arterial tree, the common carotid artery and the terminal aorta. Arterial echo-tracking techniques of high resolution and applanation tonometry were used to evaluate non-invasively the indices of arterial stiffness and carotid wave reflections. In Group I and II, there was a similar significant decrease in brachial blood pressure (BP) and carotid diastolic diameter and an increase in aortic compliance and distensibility. Groups I and II differed significantly in aortic diastolic diameter which decreased in Group I but not in Group II, and in carotid wave reflections which were modified in Group II but not in Group I. Thus, captopril associated with hydrochlorothiazide resulted in a shift in the carotid arterial reflection wave from systole to diastole with no reduction in the aortic diastolic dimension. For similar BP reduction, the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride had no significant effect on the carotid reflection wave, but caused a significant reduction in the aortic diastolic diameter. These intergroup differences were related to the presence or absence of converting enzyme inhibition.",

The two practices had 2747 patients who were aged 65 years and over and 221 of these had heart failure (prevalence of 80 per 1000). The principal aetiological factor considered responsible for heart failure was: coronary heart disease in 45% of patients, hypertension 18%, valve disease 9%, cor pulmonale 7%, cardiomyopathy 2% and a metabolic problem 2% (aetiology unknown in 17% of cases). Urea and electrolytes had been checked in the last year in 59% of patients. Chest x-ray and electrocardiography had been performed in 89% and 80% of patients, respectively, and echocardiography in 30%. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were being prescribed to 33% of patients.", 
    "626": "The study found a high prevalence of heart failure among patients aged 65 years and over. Coronary heart disease was considered to be the main aetiological factor. Patients were being investigated mainly by means of chest x-ray and electrocardiography. Most patients with heart failure were not receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors. Evaluation of heart failure by clinical criteria alone is now deemed insufficient. Echocardiography should be used routinely to assess cardiac dysfunction. Patients with confirmed left ventricular dysfunction will benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors unless contraindications exist. The study suggests that there is a need to explore ways of optimizing the management of patients with heart failure.", 
    "627": "We conducted a prospective study on 81 consecutive patients who had a kidney transplant with graft function for over 3 months to evaluate the prevalence of erythrocytosis following renal transplantation (PTE) and its potential risk factors. True PTE was defined as a RBC mass > 120% of the theoretical value allowing for sex, weight and height. 18 patients (22.2%) developed PTE (RBC mass = 157 +/- 21%) with no evidence of polycythemia vera (PV), or secondary polycythemia due to reduced arterial oxygen, kidney or hepatic tumors. PTE was more common in males (p = 0.041) and less common in patients treated with recombinant erythropoietin (rHEPO) prior to transplantation. 18 non-polycythemic patients (Hb 12.6 +/- 1.3 g/dl) matched for sex, age and renal function were used as case controls. Fewer PTE patients were transfused post-transplantation (p = 0.026). At the time of diagnosis, mean serum EPO was normal and similar to that of controls. PTE patients had lower serum ferritin (p = 0.005) and more commonly received iron supplementation when PTE occurred (p = 0.003). Other clinical factors did not differ significantly between the two groups. Two patients had a thrombotic event, 6 recovered spontaneously and 11 were successfully treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). The normalization of Hb, hematocrit and RBC mass in ACEI treated patients was accompanied by a decline in serum EPO (p = 0.008). We conclude that true erythrocytosis is prevalent in cyclosporine-treated renal transplant patients. PTE seems to be an idiopathic erythrocytosis. Pretransplant rHEPO treatment may limit PTE by blunting the increased sensitivity of erythroid precursors to EPO and iron supplementation, which stimulates the development of PTE. ACEI treatment is effective and safe.", 
    "628": "The potential interaction between lithium and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was investigated in a retrospective, longitudinal, case-control study of 20 hypertensive patients previously stabilized on lithium therapy. The objective of the study was to determine the impact of ACE inhibition on steady-state lithium concentrations and to evaluate the potential association of altered lithium clearance with age, renal function, and electrolyte balance. After initiation of the ACE inhibitor, steady-state lithium concentrations increased by 36.1%, lithium clearance was reduced by 25.5% (p < 0.0001), and four patients presented with symptoms suggestive of lithium toxicity. Significant bivariate correlations were observed for lithium clearance change and age (r = -0.45; p < 0.05) and for lithium clearance change and serum creatinine (r = -0.52; p < 0.02). Multiple regression analysis indicated that 25% of the change in lithium clearance was associated with a change in serum creatinine. This percentage was increased to 35% by the inclusion of age in the regression model. None of the other variables (age, height, weight, or change in serum sodium/potassium) made a significant contribution to this model. The authors concluded that a clinically important increase in lithium concentrations can occur in patients started on ACE inhibitor therapy. As elderly patients may be uniquely predisposed to this interaction, avoidance of this medication combination in older populations should be considered.", 
    "629": "1. Kinins, which are produced locally in arterial walls, stimulate the release of endothelium-derived vasodilator substances. Therefore, they may participate in the metabolic adaptation to chronic exercise that occurs in the coronary circulation. Experiments were designed to compare the reactivity to bradykinin in coronary arteries isolated from sedentary and exercised-trained dogs (for 8-10 weeks). 2. The organ chambers used in this study were designed for measurement of isometric tension and cell membrane potential with glass microelectrodes. Rings of canine isolated coronary arteries with endothelium were suspended in the organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (37 degrees C, gassed with 5% CO2 in 95 O2), and were all treated with indomethacin to prevent interference from prostaglandins. 3. Bradykinin evoked concentration-dependent relaxations of the coronary arteries. However, the kinin was significantly less potent in relaxing coronary arteries from the sedentary dogs than those from the trained ones. 4. In the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthases), concentration-relaxation curves to bradykinin were shifted to the right in both types of preparations. Nonetheless, the peptide was still significantly more potent in arteries from exercise-trained animals. 5. In the electrophysiological experiments, concentration-hyperpolarization curves to bradykinin obtained in arteries from sedentary dogs were also significantly to the right of those in vessels from exercise-trained animals. Thus, in arteries from exercised animals, bradykinin more potently evoked the release of both nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). 7. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, perindoprilat, shifted to the left the concentration-relaxation curves to bradykinin obtained under control conditions and in the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine. The concentration-hyperpolarization curves to bradykinin were also shifted to the left by perindoprilat. The shift induced by the ACE-inhibitor in either type of preparation was not significantly different. 8. These findings demonstrate that exercise-training augments the sensitivity of the coronary artery of the dog to the endothelium-dependent effects of bradykinin. This sensitization to bradykinin may reflect an increased role of both NO and EDHF, and is not the consequence of differences in ACE activity in the receptor compartment.", 
    "630": "The use of lisinopril was assessed in inducing regression of established left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy was achieved by aortic constriction in the rat. Lisinopril was administered in drinking water (5 mg/kg body weight/day) to aortic constricted rats starting from Day 30 for a period of further 30 days. At the end of 60 days the rates of protein synthesis were measured using the flooding dose technique. Lisinopril reduced the mixed protein contents of the regressed left ventricle from 223 +/- 7 mg to 175 +/- 10 mg/left ventricle in the aortic constricted rats; P < 0.01, all data are means +/- SEM, n = 5-8. The regression of left ventricular mass occurred along with simultaneous decrease in the rate of protein synthesis (i.e., 6.56 +/- 0.33 in aortic constricted rats versus 4.40 +/- 0.44%/day, in lisinopril treated left ventricles, P < 0.05). However, the expanded cardiocyte fiber thickness remained unchanged despite lisinopril treatment (i.e., 20.4 +/- 0.7 in aortic constricted rats versus 19.5 +/- 0.6 microm in regressed left ventricles, P > 0.05). The results indicate that regression of pressure overloaded hypertrophy with lisinopril primarily occurs by a decrease in protein synthesis in the connective tissue components of the left ventricle, although cytoskeletal components may be unaffected.", 
    "631": "Forty-one patients with a nephrotic syndrome and biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy were administered a 3 to 6-month course of cyclosporine (CsA;4 to 5 mg/kg per day). Differential solute clearances were used to evaluate glomerular function, before and after therapy. CsA lowered median proteinuria by 56%, from 7.3 to 3.2 g/24 h (P < 0.0001). Corresponding mean increments in serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, and oncotic pressure values were 31, 32, and 26%, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Arterial pressure, GFR, and renal plasma flow remained constant, but CsA restored the dextran-sieving curve toward normal, lowering the computed fraction of shunt-like pores by 25% (P < 0.05). In 14 instances, a cross-over design was used to randomly assign patients to 3 months of CsA versus 3 months of enalapril (10 to 30 mg daily), separated by a 1-month washout interval. Although enalapril lowered arterial pressure by 8 mm Hg (P < 0.01), it had no effect on proteinuria, plasma protein composition, filtration dynamics, or dextran sieving (all P = not significant). CsA dependence of proteinuria, indicated by relapsing nephrosis after CsA withdrawal, required additional courses of CsA to maintain proteinuria subnephrotic in most patients. In six patients with declining GFR during prolonged CsA treatment, a repeat biopsy showed more prominent immune deposits and a thicker glomerular basement membrane than at baseline. It was concluded that: (1) CsA lowers proteinuria in MN in part, by enhancing barrier size-selectivity; (2) lack of comparable efficacy of enalapril suggests that the antiproteinuric effect of CsA is related to its immuno-suppressive rather than glomerulodepressor properties; but (3) judged by repeat biopsy, CsA does not prevent continuing autoantibody formation in this disorder.", 
    "632": "This study was designed to investigate qualitative changes in the carbohydrate side-chains of two acute-phase glycoproteins, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), in 37 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The glycosylation profile of AGP and ACT was studied using affinity immunoelectrophoresis with the lectin concanavalin A (conA). Serum concentration of soluble receptor for interleukin-2 (sIL-2R) and activity of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were measured by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and enzyme kinetic assay, respectively. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis and nephelometric assay were used to determine serum concentration of AGP, ACT and C-reactive protein (CRP). In 11 patients with active disease, a decreased reactivity of AGP with conA was found as compared with controls (n = 44) and patients with nonactive sarcoidosis (n = 26). A similar tendency was seen with ACT. In the same group, increased concentrations of serum AGP and higher levels of sIL-2R were detected compared with patients with nonactive sarcoidosis. In the entire sarcoidosis group, there was a negative correlation between ACE activity and AGP and ACT affinity for conA (r = -0.6358, and r = -0.5019, respectively) and a positive correlation with sIL-2R level (r = 0.8241). In nine patients with elevated concentrations of serum CRP, no differences were found in disease activity and glycosylation profile of AGP and ACT when compared to patients with normal serum CRP. The results suggest that in active pulmonary sarcoidosis changes in the glycosylation pattern of acute-phase glycoproteins exist, which are similar in trend and magnitude to those found in other chronic inflammatory diseases. The synthesis and glycosylation of acute-phase proteins in pulmonary sarcoidosis are probably regulated independently.",

    "636": "Enalapril therapy increases mean survival in heart failure patients by 1.68 to 1.80 months. The average additional drug and non-drug cost of enalapril therapy is estimated to be $1890 over a four year period, against which must be offset cost savings from a reduction in hospitalisations of $2060 to $2140. On balance, therefore, enalapril is cost saving, reducing health care costs for a congestive heart failure patient on average by $170 to $250 over a four year period. This value is sensitive to estimates of cost offsets and of improved survival which can result in either a net cost saving with enalapril of approximately $1200 per patient or a net additional cost of up to $3000 per patient (over four years) or greater than $20,000 per life-year saved.",

It was found that a remarkable expression of c-fos was induced by pressure overload and the expression was greatly attenuated by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. In the pressure overload group the angiotensinogen mRNA level was found increased. The above results suggest that angiotensin II is involved in the expression of c-fos due to pressure overload.", 
    "639": "Recent studies have shown that beside elevated arterial blood pressure, humoral factors such as angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin or bradykinin might play a role in the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis secondary to hypertension. In addition, it seems that perivascular fibrosis and interstitial fibrosis are controlled by independent mechanisms. Therefore, the goal of our study was to evaluate the respective role of the increased arterial pressure and of humoral factors on cardiac remodeling in an experimental hypertension model.",

A group of hypertensive rats was left untreated and a sham-operated group of normotensive rats was used for control. At the end of treatment, maximal coronary blood flow was measured in isolated perfused hearts. Cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial as well as perivascular fibrosis were evaluated by quantitative morphometry.", 
    "641": "DOCA-salt hypertensive rats exhibited a marked cardiac hypertrophy associated with a decrease of maximal coronary blood flow and interstitial and perivascular fibrosis. The calcium antagonist nearly normalized arterial pressure and suppressed all these changes. Enalapril had no effect on arterial pressure and perivascular fibrosis but decreased subendocardial fibrosis. Bosentan had a very small effect on arterial pressure but decreased cardiac hypertrophy and both perivascular and subendocardial fibrosis.",

We reviewed the case notes of all 343 patients discharged from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary 1 July-31 December 1992 with a diagnosis of cardiac failure. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to the general practitioners of the 166 patients still alive in October 1994. Only 40% of patients were discharged from hospital on ACE inhibitors. In 58.8%, the diagnosis of cardiac failure was based purely on clinical or radiological grounds. At discharge, 76.1% of patients were on lower doses of ACE inhibitors than those used in the major survival studies; with 68.9% receiving similar doses two years later.

At week 4, a substantial number of patients remained on monotherapy at either the initial dose or double the dose of losartan (52%) or enalapril (72%). The blood pressure curves for each treatment were parallel over time. The enalapril-based regimen elicited a statistically significantly greater reduction in blood pressure than the losartan-based regimen, although the mean differences in the blood pressure response between the two treatment groups was small. Based on sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or a reduction in blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg, 98% of the patients assigned to the losartan regimen and 100% of the patients assigned to the enalapril regimen had a satisfactory response with a regimen of one to three antihypertensive drugs.

Active kallikrein was determined by its kininogenase activity, and generated kinins were measured by radioimmunoassay. Total kallikrein was also determined by measuring kininogenase activity after inactive kallikrein had been activated with trypsin.", 
    "650": "Urinary protein excretion increased significantly in diabetic rats compared with non-diabetic rats. Urinary active kallikrein excretion was significantly reduced in diabetic rats, whereas urinary total kallikrein excretion was unchanged, resulting in a reduced percentage of active to total kallikrein compared with that in non-diabetic rats. Benidipine and captopril reduced blood pressure and attenuated the development of diabetic renal impairment in a similar manner. However, only benidipine attenuated the decreases in urinary active kallikrein excretion and the ratio of active to total kallikrein in diabetic rats.",

    "652": "For validation of differential renal vein renin determinations in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (RVH), we investigated 102 patients suspected of suffering from RVH before and 1 h after administration of 25 mg captopril. Sensitivity, specificity and posterior probability for renin ratio (RR) and renin secretion (RS) were calculated based on 44 patients with proven RVH and 58 patients with primary hypertension (PH) using discriminant analysis. There is good (> 95%) and identical specificity of both variables under all conditions, whereas sensitivity remains poor even after Captopril administration (RR 23% vs. 32%; RS 20% vs. 34%). The posterior probabilities obtained by discriminant analysis revealed a cut-off point of 2.5 for the renin ratio and of 1.9 for the renin secretion. No change is observed after ACE inhibition. We conclude that the acute blockade of the renin system by captopril in differential renin sampling yields no advantages in diagnosing RVH and that there is no difference between RR and RS in the diagnosis of RVH.", 
    "653": "We studied the efficacy and safety of ramipril and the kinetics of its active moiety ramiprilat in 12 hypertensive patients receiving regular hemodialysis, after a single dose and after long-term (28 days) administration. Patients received 2.5 mg ramipril after each hemodialysis. On days 1 and 29, ramipril was administered 4 h before the hemodialysis and serial blood samples were obtained for 9 h for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. Tolerability was good, and all patients completed the study. There was a high degree of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition throughout the study. Ramipril had a clear-cut antihypertensive effect. Long-term administration of ramipril did not modify the time to peak ramiprilat concentration, but increased the mean maximal concentration significantly: 20.2 +/- 12.7 vs. 10.4 +/- 7.1 ng center dot ml-1. The mean accumulation ratio was 2.2. Ramiprilat hemodialysis clearance was 31.7 ml/min (range 4.2-64.9 ml/min) on day 1 and 21.0 ml/min (range 7.9-56.5 ml/min) on day 29. Ramipril 2.5 mg, administered after hemodialysis, appears to be safe and effective in hypertensive patients receiving periodic hemodialysis. Despite an increase in ramiprilat concentration from day 1 to day 29, the steady state was reached. We describe the role of nonrenal clearance of ramiprilat.", 
    "654": "We tested whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy with quinapril prevents the deterioration of mechanical function and high-energy phosphate metabolism that occurs in chronically infarcted heart. Rats were subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) or sham operation. Four groups were studied: sham-operated rats (n = 10), rats with myocardial infarction (MI, n = 9), sham-operated quinapril-treated rats (n = 8), and infarcted quinapril-treated (n = 13) rats. Treated rats received 6 mg/kg/day of the ACE inhibitor quinapril orally, initiated 1 h after MI or sham operation. Eight weeks after LAD ligation or sham operation, hearts were isolated and buffer-perfused isovolumically. High-energy phosphate metabolism and intracellular pH were continuously recorded with 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Hearts were subjected to 15-min control, 30-min hypoxia (95% N2/5% CO2, and 30-min reoxygenation. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) was reduced in infarcted hearts (58 +/- 10 vs. 98 +/- 9 mm Hg in sham, p < 0.05), and this reduction was partially prevented by quinapril (78 +/- 8 mm Hg). ATP content of residual intact myocardium after sham operation or MI was unchanged. Creatine phosphate was reduced in infarcted hearts (107 +/- 10 vs. 138 +/- 5% of control ATP, p < 0.05), and quinapril prevented this decrease (131 +/- 8%). Therefore, quinapril preserved both function and high-energy phosphate metabolism in the chronically infarcted heart. However, when hearts were subjected to acute hypoxia, susceptibility to acute metabolic stress was substantially increased in both quinapril-treated groups: ATP content at end-hypoxia was reduced to 31 +/- 7 and 37 +/- 6% in sham and infarcted quinapril-treated groups, whereas ATP in untreated sham and infarcted hearts was 66 +/- 6 and 66 +/- 3% of baseline values (p < 0.05 untreated vs. quinapril treated). Likewise, recovery of LVDP during reoxygenation was impaired by quinapril treatment (15 +/- 7 and 15 +/- 4 mm Hg in quinapril-treated sham and MI vs. 73 +/- 9 and 46 +/- 9 mm Hg in untreated sham and MI groups, p < 0.05 untreated vs. quinapril treated). The most likely explanation for the unexpected finding of increased susceptibility to acute metabolic stress in the quinapril-treated groups is reduced wall thickness leading to increased wall stress. The preservation of high-energy phosphate content in residual intact hearts after MI may contribute to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors after MI.", 
    "655": "Because diabetes mellitus leads to vascular dysfunction, we examined the microvascular endothelial and smooth muscle function in long-term diabetes and a possible influence of fosinopril treatment (10 mg/kg). We investigated isolated perfused mesenteric beds of diabetic rats (4 groups: control, control + fosinopril, diabetes, diabetes + fosinopril; diabetes of 6-month duration, induced by streptozotocin, STC) were investigated using computer-assisted microvideoangiometry. Vascular diameter of four different vascular regions [classified as conductive (G1, 303 +/- 6.5 mu m and G2, 239 +/- 6.3 mu m) and resistance (G3, 192 +/- 4.5 mu m and G4, 124 +/- 2.6 mu m) vessel generations; resting conditions, control group] were increased in diabetes by approximately 20%. However, the endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to 1 mu M acetylcholine (ACh) was reduced from 38-44% to 20-25% (diabetes mellitus) with maximal impairment in G4 vessels. This could be significantly antagonized by fosinopril treatment. Similarly, vasodilation in response to 1 mu M glyceroltrinitrate (GTN) was reduced from 50-58 to 20-30%, but was partially prevented by fosinopril (32-38%), whereas potassium chloride (KCl)-induced vasoconstriction did not show differences between the groups. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by 3 mu M L-NG-nitro arginine (L-NNA) resulted in a slight vasoconstriction of all vessels (12-25%), with maximum response in G3/G4. This was not altered by disease or treatment. We conclude that (a) long-term diabetes leads to endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction with reduced capability of vasodilation and either an impairment of NO release or a reduced smooth muscle responsiveness to and (b) a predominant impairment of NO-dependent regulation in small resistance vessels, and (c) that fosinopril treatment can at least partially prevent this vascular dysfunction.", 
    "656": "Platelets are intimately involved in atherosclerosis, and hypertension is a known risk factor for coronary artery disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were demonstrated to reduce hypertension and attenuate atherosclerosis. Because increased platelet aggregation was shown in hypertensive patients, the effect of a new ACE inhibitor, fosinopril, on platelet aggregation was studied. Fosinopril therapy (10 mg/day for 4 weeks) in 18 male hypertensive patients showed > or = 31% reduction in ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In vitro studies showed that fosinopril had similar inhibitory effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation. No inhibitory effect could be detected with collagen as the aggregating agent. Finally, inhibition of platelet aggregation by fosinopril was less effective in platelets derived from hypertensive patients as compared with platelets derived from normal subjects. We conclude that fosinopril possesses a significant inhibitory activity on ADP-induced platelet aggregation both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "657": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors cause coughing in 5-10% of patients, but the exact mechanisms of this effect are still unclear. In the airways ACE degrades substance P so the cough mechanism may be related to this peptide.", 
    "658": "Nine patients who developed a cough and five patients who did not develop a cough when taking the ACE inhibitor enalapril (2.5 or 5.0 mg/day) for hypertension were enrolled in the study. No subjects had respiratory disease and the respiratory function of all subjects was normal. One month after stopping enalapril, inhalation of hypertonic saline (4%) was performed using an ultrasonic nebuliser for 15-30 minutes to induce sputum. The concentration of substance P in the sputum sample was measured by radioimmunoassay. In four of the nine cases with a cough enalapril was given again for 1-2 weeks and the concentration of substance P in the induced sputum was again measured.", 
    "659": "One month after stopping enalapril the mean (SE) concentration of substance P in the sputum of the group with a cough was 16.6 (3.0) fmol/ml, significantly higher than that in the subjects without a cough (0.9 (0.5) fmol/ml). All four subjects in the group with a cough who were given a repeat dose of enalapril developed a cough again, but the concentrations of substance P in the induced sputum while taking enalapril (17.9 (3.2) fmol/ml) were similar to the values whilst off enalapril (20.0 (2.5) fmol/ml).", 
    "660": "The mechanisms of ACE inhibitor-induced coughing may involve substance P mediated airway priming. However, the final triggering of the ACE inhibitor-induced coughing is unlikely to be due to this peptide.", 
    "661": "The metabolic effects of angiotensin II (AII) were studied under steady-state conditions of euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia in anaesthetized rats. Pressor doses of AII (50 and 400 ng/kg per min) had dose-dependent hypertensive and hyperglycaemic effects during glucose clamp studies. Glucose turnover measurements showed that hepatic glucose output (HGO) increased equally at both pressor doses compared with either saline infusion or AII infusion at a dose without a pressor effect (20 ng/kg per min); however, glucose disposal increased significantly only at 50 ng/kg per min. Infusion of the AII receptor antagonist, saralasin, did not itself alter glucose output or disposal significantly, but it abolished the effects of a simultaneous infusion of AII. It is concluded that pressor doses of AII increase HGO by a receptor-mediated mechanism that is not related to the pressor response to the hormone. The hyperglycaemic reaction to this metabolic effect of AII is partially offset by increased glucose disposal at lower doses. The physiological significance of these metabolic actions of AII remains to be established, but they raise the possibility that AII could potentially play a role in glucose homeostasis in vivo.", 
    "662": "The aim of the present paper was to study 24-h blood pressure profile in twenty patients with essential hypertension (mild to moderate) before and after treatment with ACE inhibitor enalapril in one day dose in the morning (15.6 +/- 6.1 mg). 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was examined after 14 days of placebo administration and after one month of enalapril therapy. Enalapril treatment decreased systolic blood pressure of 11.3 mmHg during daytime and of 9.4 mmHg at night, diastolic blood pressure of 6.1 mmHg during daytime and 5.8 mmHg at night, all differences were significant in comparison to placebo (p < 0.01). The through-peak ratios were 63.2% for systolic blood pressure and 54.0% for diastolic blood pressure. We can conclude that enalapril treatment in one day morning dose is efficient to decrease blood pressure during 24-h span without altering the diurnal profile.", 
    "663": "ACEI form a group of antihypertensives which inhibit the angiotensin II (A II) production and thus not only reduce the blood pressure but exert also a positive metabolic and antiproliferative effect (A II is a proliferative hormone). They are therefore indicated nowadays in the treatment of essential and secondary hypertension, left-ventricular hypertrophy, chronic heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, insulin resistance and other disorders. Despite intensive studies we still do not know many, in particular mediated effects, of ACEI but these drugs have become one of the key groups in therapy.", 
    "664": "The submitted review deals with contemporary possibilities of antianginal treatment. After a brief account of pathophysiological and morphological data in different types of cardiac ischaemia and angina pectoris the author submits algorithms which should be the basis for therapeutic decisions. It is a question of proper timing of invasive examinations leading to revascularization operations in relation to medicamentous treatment. The latter is supplementary treatment before or after revascularization, or is the main approach in case of minimal complaints, in case of contraindicated invasive treatment or in case of an inoperable finding. The author discusses the action, indications, contraindications, undesirable effects, and average dosage of nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel inhibitors and antithrombotics. The author mentions also the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. View on treatment will change with advancing knowledge.", 
    "665": "Hypertension is not solely a phenomenon of elevation of systemic blood pressure. It frequently occurs in association with a great deal of metabolic derangement's and should never be regarded as coincidental only. Furthermore, a knowledge of these metabolic derangements may provide a clue to unveil the underlying mechanisms how essential hypertension and its associated complications arise. Therefore we devoted our attention to platelet dysfunction and dyslipidemia which are closely associated with atherosclerosis-the commonest complication of hypertension. We found there exists enhanced platelet aggregation in essential hypertension and a variety of its associated atherosclerotic diseases. Such an aberration in platelet function may be modified after administration of antihypertensive medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockades, beta blockades and dietary manipulation. We also demonstrated the close association between hypertension and its associated atherosclerotic complications and abnormal lipids profile. Hypertriglyceridemia which was initially regarded unimportant in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is found to be closely related to hypertension. In an intensive review, we found that people in Taiwan has experienced a huge increase in dietary calories and total fat consumption. In order to solve this emerging problem, a national guideline for diagnosis and management of lipid disorders in Taiwan was developed and announced. Through these efforts, we hope we can reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Taiwan and even extend our experience to other countries.", 
    "666": "In this study, we investigated the association between the drug-induced pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia (PIE) syndrome in a patient with hypertension and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) captopril. Although the patient developed diffuse lung field infiltrates accompanied by productive cough and striking peripheral eosinophilia, these symptoms disappeared after termination of the administration of captopril, pronase and cephalexine. Furthermore, the results of the peripheral lymphocyte stimulation test, skin patch test and provocation test under informed consent showed a positive reaction only for captopril. Therefore, this patient was diagnosed as captopril-induced PIE syndrome.",

    "670": "A random sample was studied of 25 outpatients with symptoms of mild to moderate heart failure, despite treatment with diuretics, digoxin, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Their mean age was 65 years, with mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.24 and a peak oxygen consumption of 14.4 ml/min/kg. Two patients dropped out on lacidipine, one patient on placebo.",

    "672": "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, invasive haemodynamics, and plasma neurohormones.", 
    "673": "Treatment with lacidipine 4 mg once daily, as compared to placebo treatment, significantly improved peak oxygen consumption (P < 0.02), cardiac index (P < 0.01), and stroke volume (P < 0.03) paralleled by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (P < 0.03) and arteriovenous oxygen content difference (P < 0.01). Plasma noradrenaline, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone values did not differ between lacidipine and placebo.", 
    "674": "This second generation dihydropyridine may be of value as an adjunct to standard treatment in congestive heart failure patients.", 
    "675": "The hereditary nephritides are often progressive, resulting in kidney failure and the need for renal replacement therapy. There is no currently known beneficial treatment for these disorders. We observed three patients with hereditary glomerulonephritis with plasma creatinine concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 mg/dL who were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) for 3.5 to 6 years. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy was accompanied by a decrease in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 115 +/- 10 mm Hg to 93 +/- 2 mm Hg (+/- SD), a decrease in the mean urinary protein/creatinine ratio from 2,910 +/- 1,720 mg/g to 391 +/- 355 mg/g, and stabilization of the decline of creatinine clearance with time in two of the three patients. Based on this apparent benefit of ACEIs in hereditary nephritis, we suggest that a prospective controlled trial of ACEIs should be undertaken among a large group of such patients. Pending the results of such a study, ACEIs should be considered for the treatment of patients with proteinuric and progressive hereditary nephritis.", 
    "676": "Elderly patients have a significantly higher mortality and morbidity compared with younger patients in the postmyocardial infarction period and thus, with the appropriate management have a greater potential for benefit compared with younger patients. It has been shown in the large randomized trials that elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction benefit significantly from administration of beta-blocking agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Aspirin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin) have been shown to benefit patients of all age groups. Secondary prevention with cessation of smoking, use of lipid-lowering agents, treatment of hypertension, and estrogen therapy in the postmenopausal woman have been shown to be effective. Elderly patients, therefore, who are free of general noncardiac disability and who can be expected to live meaningful lives should be offered a comprehensive program to reduce their cardiac morbidity and mortality after discharge following acute myocardial infarction."
