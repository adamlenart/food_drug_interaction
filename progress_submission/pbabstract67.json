    "0": "The influence of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on the aortic wall mechanical properties under angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition (enalaprilat, 0.3 mg/kg iv) or angiotensin II receptor (AT1) blockade (E-3174, 1 mg/kg iv) was examined in eight normotensive and eight renovascular hypertensive conscious dogs. Aortic diameter (D; sonomicrometry)-pressure (P; microtransducer) hysteresis loops during steady state and during rapid distal aortic occlusion allowed (after hysteresis elimination) calculation of the aortic wall viscosity index, the purely elastic P-D relationship, and derivation into compliance-pressure curves. At the early stage ofrenovascular hypertension when activation of RAS is more pronounced, aortic wall stiffness and wall viscosity were increased as compared with normotensive states. Blood pressure remained unchanged in normotensive animals and was reduced during hypertension after antihypertensive treatments. In hypertensive animals, enalaprilat and E-3174 decreased viscosity index and shifted the compliance-pressure curve upward with respect to pretreatment conditions. In normotensive dogs, whereas E-3174 did not change the compliance-pressure curve and viscosity index, enalaprilat increased compliance and reduced viscosity index. We concluded that in normotensive dogs converting enzyme inhibition modifies arterial viscoelastic parameters by angiotensin-independent mechanisms that contribute to the modulation of the buffering function of large arteries.", 
    "1": "In conscious deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt-hypertensive dogs, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and imidaprilat significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and significantly increased urine flow rate, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion. However, the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan caused a significant increase only in urinary sodium excretion without significant changes in MAP, urine flow rate, ERPF, and glomerular filtration rate. Simultaneous infusion of a bradykinin receptor antagonist inhibited the ACE inhibitor-induced reduction in MAP and increase in ERPF. DOCA salt treatment markedly suppressed plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) concentration (P < 0.001), although it decreased renal ANG II content only slightly (P < 0.05). Comparison of the expression of renal AT1 receptor mRNA in control kidneys with that in DOCA salt-hypertensive kidneys revealed no significant change. These results suggest that, in low-renin hypertension, inhibition of the relatively maintained ANG II production in the kidney participates in the natriuretic action of ACE inhibitors. However, hypotensive and other renal effects are mainly due to the action of bradykinin.", 
    "2": "To characterize the role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1A) or V2 receptors and the possible interaction with the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), young male SHR were treated from 6 to 10 wk of age with AVP V(1A) receptor blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, combination of V(1A) receptor blockade and ACE inhibition, V2 receptor blockade, and vehicle. Treatments were then withdrawn, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured until 19 wk of age. At both 10 and 19 wk of age, SBP was significantly reduced with V(1A) receptor blockade, ACE inhibition, and combined treatment compared with vehicle treatment, although no treatment normalized SBP to levels of Donryu normotensive rats. Throughout the experimental period, no significant additive effects were observed with combined treatment. At 10 wk of age, plasma AVP concentration and 24-h urinary AVP excretion were increased with AVP V2 receptor blockade. At 19 wk of age, SBP was significantly higher in rats previously treated with V2 receptor blockade (233 +/- 3 mmHg) than with vehicle (221 +/- 2 mmHg) (P < 0.01). Left ventricular mass was significantly reduced in rats previously treated with ACE inhibition or combined treatment. These results suggest that AVP (via V(1A) receptors) and angiotensin II contribute to the pathogenesis of SHR hypertension, whereas the AVP V2 receptor may be involved in preventing the full expression of the hypertension, in male SHR.", 
    "3": "Inhibition of peptidases within the lungs not only potentiates the effects of neuropeptides released from C-fibers but also the effects of bradykinin and capsaicin both of which stimulate C-fibers. To determine if peptidase inhibition potentiates C-fiber activation, we challenged pulmonary C-fibers in rats with capsaicin or bradykinin before and after inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Inhibition of NEP by phosphoramidon (10 mg/kg, i.v.) potentiated the effect of capsaicin (0.5-1 micrograms, i.v.) on C-fiber activity but did not change the response to bradykinin (1-2 micrograms, i.v.). Inhibition of ACE by captopril (5 mg/kg, i.v.) potentiated C-fiber activation by either bradykinin or capsaicin. Aerosol administration of either phosphoramidon (1 x 10(-5) M, 2 min) or captopril (4.6 x 10(-3) M, 2 min) potentiated C-fiber activation by capsaicin aerosol (1.6 x 10(-4) M, 1 min) but not by bradykinin aerosol (9.4 x 10(-5) M, 1 min). Therefore, inhibition of NEP or ACE may potentiate airway obstructive mechanisms initiated by C-fiber stimulation.", 
    "4": "This report described a 44 years-old female mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) patient presenting pulmonary hypertension, successfully treated with angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The patient was diagnosed as having MCTD because of Raynaud's phenomenon, swollen hand, and elevated level of anti-U 1 RNP antibodies. She was admitted to our hospital one year after the diagnosis of MCTD, because she experienced dyspnea and pretibial edema. A diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was made by echocardiography and catheterization study. Pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery resistance declined and returned gradually to normal during a period of three months with prednisolone and enalapril (10 mg/day) therapy. Pulmonary hypertension is one of fetal complications with MCTD, and 5 year mortality rate is reported less than 50%. However, a successful therapy for the pulmonary hypertension with MCTD has not been established yet. We considered that ACE inhibitor might be useful to control the pulmonary hypertension with MCTD and could improve the prognosis of MCTD.", 
    "5": "The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three treatment methods available for treatment of previously medicated patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The comparison was made between adjusting or increasing previous medication and switching the previous drug treatment to lisinopril (CAS 76547-98-3) or lisinopril hydrochlorothiazide (CAS 58-93-5) therapy and in both of these treatment groups the effect of additional intensified health education was tested. An open, randomised, controlled multi-centre study lasting 36 weeks involving 189 doctors and 69 nurses was carried out in 155 centres of primary health care and occupational health care system in Finland. The study population consisted of 1156 patients, age 30-70 years, (mean DBP 95-115 mmHg in the last three to five measurements during follow-up). The number of patients achieving target pressure (DBP < 90 mmHg) at the end of the study, defined daily doses (DDD) of antihypertensive drugs and side-effects in different treatment groups were regarded as the main outcome measures of the study. After exclusions and drop-outs the final analysis was carried out with 900 patients, 419 women (46.6%) and 481 men (53.4%). Patients receiving lisinopril treatment achieved target pressure significantly more often (p < 0.001) than those continuing their previous or adjusted medication at 36 weeks (59.2 and 55.5% vs 40.3 and 42.7%). Only a small additional but statistically non-significant blood pressure lowering effect was achieved with intensified non-pharmacological treatment at weeks 12 and 24, but this difference had disappeared at week 36. The mean DDDs of different antihypertensive drugs did not differ between groups except for female patients on previous or adjusted medication not receiving health education, the mean DDD being significantly (p < 0.05) higher at weeks 24 and 36 in this group. The profile of adverse effects at the end of the study clearly favoured patients on lisinopril treatment except for cough which was reported in 18% of patients vs 10% in the control groups. 81 patients on lisinopril treatment were withdrawn from the study because of cough. The results showed that hypertensive patients with poor treatment control benefit from all three approaches. A greater proportion of patients on lisinopril treatment achieved target pressure and also experienced fewer side effects than those continuing on adjusted previous medication. Intensified personal health education given once a month during six months had only a small additional beneficial effect on reaching the target pressure and this effect was lost in three months after the health education period.", 
    "6": "The pharmacodynamic and toxicological profile of the new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexipril (CAS 82586-52-5) and its active diacid metabolite moexiprilat were studied in vitro as well as in vivo. In vitro, moexiprilat was a potent inhibitor of ACE in guinea pig serum as well as on purified ACE from rabbit lung with IC50 values of 2.6 and 4.9 nmol/l, respectively. Both, moexipril and moexiprilat inhibited the angiotensin I (ANG I)-induced contractions of rabbit aorta concentration-dependently, whereas contractions by other agents were not affected, indicating a high selectivity of both compounds for ACE. Similar results were obtained in vivo in experiments investigating the blood pressure increasing response to intravenous injection of ANG I or ANG II in conscious normotensive rats and dogs after oral or intravenous application of moexipril or moexiprilat, respectively. The antihypertensive effects of the oral application of moexipril were studied in models of hypertension in the rat as well as in renal hypertensive dogs. In renal hypertensive rats, moexipril (0.03-10 mg/kg p.o.) caused a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure with a threshold dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Once daily treatment of the animals with 3 mg/kg/d for 5 days lowered mean blood pressure by about 70 mmHg and blood pressure was maintained on this low level for the experimental period. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, oral administration of moexipril (30 mg/kg/d) for 5 days caused a progressive lowering of mean blood pressure from pre-treatment values of 180 +/- 7 mmHg to a trough on day 4 of 127 +/- 4 mmHg. In perinephritic hypertensive dogs, oral administration of moexipril (10 mg/kg) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg) caused a drop of mean blood pressure by 25 mmHg from pre-treatment control, which persisted for 24 h. In all these models, the action was characterized by a rapid onset and a long duration of action. After cessation of treatment, a gradual return to baseline values was observed. In contrast, only slight blood pressure lowering effects were seen in normotensive rats at high doses (100 mg/kg p.o.). The general pharmacological properties of moexipril were also studied in generally accepted models in vitro and in vivo. In doses or concentrations more than 100 times higher than those causing ACE inhibition, no effects were observed on the central nervous system, on isolated smooth muscle preparations, the digestive system, the kidney or the lung. Additionally, moexipril is devoid of anti-inflammatory properties and has no effect on platelet function. On the cardiovascular system, the effects observed can be attributed to ACE inhibition by moexipril. Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed the heart and kidneys as target organs. These effects, based on highly exaggerated pharmacological activity, are comparable to other ACE-inhibitors. No potential for mutagenic or carcinogenic activity and no evidence of reproductive toxicity was apparent for meoxipril. The preclinical data indicate that moexipril possesses a high degree of specifity as an ACE-inhibitor without relevant side effects or gross toxicity.", 
    "7": "1. ANBP2 is a comparative outcome trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor- and diuretic-based treatment of hypertension in the elderly using a prospective randomized open-label design with blinding of endpoint assessments. 2. The primary objective is to determine, in hypertensive subjects 65-84 years of age, whether there is any difference in total cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal) over a 5 year treatment period between the two treatment regimens. 3. The study is being conducted in general practices throughout Australia and will recruit 6000 subjects over 2-3 years (3000 in each arm of the study) to provide 30,000 years of patient observation. This will allow detection of a 25% difference in the primary outcome variable at the 5% level with a power of 90%. 4. Following randomization to one of the treatment arms, each subject's blood pressure (BP) is managed by the general practitioner according to his/her usual practice to achieve goal BP with guidelines for drug therapy relevant to each treatment arm. 5. Study endpoint information is gained from a review of practice records every 3 months and these data are then assessed by an Endpoint Committee blinded for treatment randomization. 6. Interim analyses of endpoint data will be conducted at the end of randomization and then annually until the final analysis after 5 years of observation in each subject.", 
    "8": "In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), beta-receptor up-regulation is regarded as one of the mechanisms leading to improved function and prognosis. To clarify whether beta-receptor up-regulation is involved in the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we investigated the actions of ACE inhibitors and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist on beta-receptors of neonatal rat cultured cardiac myocytes. Angiotensin II (A-II) increased the spontaneous beating frequency of the cells, and the effect was completely antagonized by the AT1 antagonist CV-11974. Under control conditions, beta-receptor density (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) were measured by radiobinding assay with the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP-12177, and were 103 +/- 11 fmol/mg protein and 3.4 +/- 0.4 nmol/L, respectively. Captopril increased the beta-receptor density of myocytes and augmented the response to isoproterenol. Bmax was increased by 34% after 24 h treatment with 10(-6) mol/L captopril. CV-3480, and ACE inhibitor that contains no sulfhydryl group, but neither A-II nor the AT1 antagonist, also up-regulated beta-receptors. The results suggest that beta-receptor up-regulation contributes at least partly to the beneficial cardiac effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF. ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists seem to play different roles in clinical practice.", 
    "9": "The protective effect and mechanism of action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) captopril was investigated in organelles from ischemic myocardial cells in a canine coronary ligation model. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondrial fractions were extracted from ischemic and nonischemic myocardial cells from captopril- and saline-treated (control) hearts. Heart rate, cardiac output, and right ventricular systolic blood pressure were similar in the captopril-treated and control groups. Left ventricular systolic blood pressure (LVPs) decreased gradually to 89% of the baseline value after captopril administration, and to 78% of the baseline value after ligation. Ca-ATPase activity in the SR, the respiratory control ratio (RCR) in the mitochondria, and dinitrophenol (DNP)-stimulated ATPase activity were significantly higher in ischemic myocardium from the captopril-treated group than from the saline-treated (control) group. The SH group content of both organelles was higher in the captopril-treated group. Our results suggest that, in addition to their hemodynamic effects, ACE-I agents containing SH groups protect the myocardium from ischemic damage by preventing enzyme oxidation.", 
    "10": "To review critically the persistent suggestion that at least a part of the beneficial and side effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is derived from the potentiation of endogenous bradykinin (BK).",

    "13": "The development of effective BK antagonists is recent and provides novel opportunities to assess the role of BK in physiology and pathology. The role of BK as an inflammatory mediator is relatively well understood, and current drug development programs for kinin receptor agonists and antagonists are focused on the inflammatory pharmacological profile of kinins. The kallikrein-kinin system may not be active to a significant degree in normal individuals, but rather recruited during tissue injury or by specific physiological conditions (such as high sodium intake). The role of BK in some inflammatory/anaphylactoid side effects of ACEIs is not firmly established, but possible. The role of BK in the therapeutic effects of ACEIs depends on the model in animal studies and is likely to be modest in essential hypertension.", 
    "14": "Several methodological problems have delayed the progress of clinical research of the kallikrein-kinin system. While ACEIs clearly potentiate the tissue effects of exogenous BK, the role of endogenous BK in the normal and pathological circulation is still uncertain.", 
    "15": "Over the past 10 years, several clinical studies have concluded that, in patients already receiving conventional therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors further reduce the risk of death following myocardial infarction (MI). Post-MI ACE inhibitors have proven to be effective as long term therapy in high risk patients as well as when used for much shorter periods in a broad patient population. However, while considerable mortality data have been collected, the effects of ACE inhibitors post-MI on other cardiovascular outcomes have not been as well documented. In addition, a number of issues regarding the most effective use of these agents remain unresolved. This paper, the second of two parts, focuses on the clinical issues and controversies surrounding the use of ACE inhibitors following acute MI. The effects of ACE inhibitors on the outcomes of sudden death, nonsudden death, recurrent angina, mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction are reviewed and potential mechanisms of action are proposed. In addition, ACE inhibitor therapy is discussed in terms of patient selection criteria, choice of agent, optimal dosing regimen, concomitant use of other therapies and relative costs of treatment. Finally, potential mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors are proposed for each of the outcomes examined.", 
    "16": "There is an increasing body of clinical trial evidence to support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the management of patients following myocardial infarction (MI). Enthusiasm for the use of ACE inhibitors in the acute phase of MI had previously been tempered by the adverse results of an early trial. However, exciting new information is available from several large, randomized studies that has not only quelled those initial concerns but also attests to the efficacy of using this class of medication in the first 24 h after an acute MI. A Canadian National Opinion Leader Symposium was held in November 1995 to review the results of the major ACE inhibitor clinical trials and to discuss key issues and controversies surrounding their use in acute MI. The focus of this paper, the first of two parts, is on the results of the major ACE inhibitor clinical trials.", 
    "17": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are used increasingly for the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure, and they reduce mortality when given after myocardial infarction. Of the patients prescribed these drugs 0.1-0.7% develop angio-oedema, but the association is not widely recognized. In 60% of cases the onset occurs during the first week of treatment; however, it may be considerably delayed. Angio-oedema nearly always occurs on the head and neck, frequently involving the mouth, tongue, pharynx and larynx. The course is unpredictable, and attacks vary in severity from mild to fatal from laryngeal obstruction. Severe ACEI-induced angio-oedema may require emergency treatment with adrenalin and early intubation. The drug should be withdrawn in any patient who presents with ACEI-induced angio-oedema, and treatment continued with an appropriate drug of a different class. Therapy with ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with a prior history of idiopathic angio-oedema, or in patients with hereditary or acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.", 
    "18": "Lisinopril, the lysine analogue of enalaprilat, is a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which is administered once daily by mouth. The efficacy of lisinopril in reducing blood pressure is well established in younger populations, and many trials now show it to be effective in lowering blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension. In comparative and non-comparative clinical trials, 68.2 to 89.1% of elderly patients responded (diastolic pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) to > or = 8 weeks' lisinopril treatment. Age-related differences in antihypertensive efficacy do not appear to be clinically significant, and dosages effective in elderly patients tend to range from 2.5 to 40 mg/day. Dosages usually need to be lower in patients with significant renal impairment. In congestive heart failure, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg/day increases exercise duration, improves left ventricular ejection fraction and has no significant effect on ventricular ectopic beats. It is similar in efficacy to enalapril and digoxin and similar or superior to captopril on most end-points. Data from the GISSI-3 post-myocardial infarction trial show that lisinopril reduced mortality and left ventricular dysfunction when given for 42 days starting within 24 hours of the onset of infarction symptoms. Results at 6 weeks and 6 months were similar in elderly and younger patients. Elderly patients, however, among other subgroups, exhibited a strong reduction in risk of low ejection fraction after treatment (-25.5%). Economic studies suggest that lisinopril is cost saving compared with other ACE inhibitors in some markets. When given according to the GISSI-3 protocol, lisinopril appears to be one of the less expensive of the successful ACE inhibitor regimens for acute myocardial infarction. In other trials, patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension improved or did not deteriorate during lisinopril treatment. Blood pressure was controlled and reductions or trends towards reductions in albuminuria were observed. These reductions were similar to those in diltiazem, nifedipine and verapamil recipients, and greater than those in patients receiving atenolol. Lisinopril appears to reduce mortality in diabetic patients after myocardial infarction and may also improve neuropathy associated with diabetes. Lisinopril is well tolerated and the profile of adverse events seen is typical of ACE inhibitors as a class. There is a tendency for more elderly than younger patients to discontinue treatment, but this trend is not clearly related to the incidence of adverse events in these age groups. Drug interactions occur with few other agents and are usually clinically significant only between lisinopril and either diuretics or lithium. Lisinopril is, thus, an effective treatment for elderly patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction and has shown promising benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "19": "Using OKT3 monoclonal antibody driven T-lymphocyte proliferation, we investigated the effects of plasma 10, 20 and 30% in cell cultures on the proliferation ex vivo after exposure to captopril or enalapril taken orally by healthy volunteers. We also studied the effects of captopril, angiotensin II and bradykinin in vitro. We observed a plasma dependent dual effect of ACE inhibition both ex vivo and in vitro and of bradykinin in vitro being a stimulated proliferation at low (10% plasma) and a suppression of proliferation at high (30% plasma). The suppression was shown to be PGE2 mediated but the nature of the stimulatory signal is unknown. Proliferation was also suppressed by angiotensin II mediated by PGE2, but angiotensin II had no stimulatory effect. The results indicate that the effects of ACE inhibition on OKT3 mAb driven T-lymphocyte proliferation is plasma dependent, class specific for ACE inhibitors and mediated by both the ACE inhibitor itself and by bradykinin. Furthermore, it was shown that indomethacin in combination with an ACE inhibitor or bradykinin converted a suppressive response into proliferation indicating an immunostimulatory activity by indomethacin.", 
    "20": "Vagal dysfunction is reported in about 70% of patients with cirrhosis, irrespective of aetiology, as detected by cardiovascular reflex tests. We have previously shown that RR-variability on 24-h ECG is a more sensitive marker of vagal dysfunction in cirrhosis. Angiotensin II inhibits vagal function in animals, and it is elevated in cirrhosis and may be the cause of the vagal dysfunction. Our aim was to observe the effect of captopril on vagal dysfunction in cirrhosis.",

    "25": "A double blind cough challenge was performed in 66 normotensive subjects (34 men) of mean age 34.8 years (range 18-80) using aerosols of distilled water. The number of coughs during the one minute exposure to water was recorded. DNA samples from venous blood were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and resolved on a 1% agarose gel.

    "27": "The observation that cough challenge is dependent on ACE genotype in normal subjects is evidence of a link between ACE activity and the cough reflex.", 
    "28": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Part of this cardioprotective effect may be mediated through kinins. Because kinins are also metabolized by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 24.11 in vivo, we hypothesized that (a) inhibition of NEP-24.11 would afford cardioprotection similar to that of ACEi and potentiate the effect of ACEi; and (b) these effects are mediated by kinins or atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or both. In Lewis inbred rats, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for 30 min, followed by 120-min reperfusion. Immediately before reperfusion rats received vehicle, the ACEi ramiprilat, the NEP-24.11 inhibitor (NEPi) CGS24592, or both. To test whether the effect of NEPi could be suppressed by blocking kinins or ANP, the kinin-receptor antagonist icatibant or ANP antagonist HS-142-1 was administered before LAD occlusion. In controls, infarct size/risk area was 69 +/- 4%; NEPi reduced this to 24 +/- 4% (p < 0.001) and ramiprilat to 20 +/- 3% (P < 0.001). NEPi did not potentiate the effect of ramiprilat (infarct size/risk area, 18 +/- 4%). The protective effect of NEPi was blocked by icatibant; infarct size/risk area, 61 +/-4%, significantly larger than NEPi along (p < 0.001) but no different from controls. The effect of NEPi was slightly diminished by the ANP antagonist HS-142-1 (infarct size/risk area, 35 +/- 3%; NS vs. NEPi alone). Thus NEP-24.11 participates in catabolism of kinins in the heart; inhibition of NEP-24.11 may increases cardiac kinins, which are responsible for the cardioprotective effect of NEPi.", 
    "29": "It has been reported that endothelin-1 (ET-1) increases in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Experimental studies showed that captopril administration reduces ET-1 secretion. In addition, it was reported that the increased ET-1 levels are a negative prognostic index. The study sought to verify whether captopril can reduce plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of reperfused anterior AMI. Forty-five patients, hospitalized for suspected anterior AMI within 4 h from the onset of symptoms, suitable for thrombolysis (first episode), Killip class I-2, were randomized (double blind) into two groups: group A (23; seven women/16 men) received captopril (as first dose) 2-4 h after starting thrombolysis (the dose was then increased up to 25 mg every 8 h). Group B (22; five women/17 men) received placebo after thrombolysis. All the patients met the reperfusion criteria. The two groups were similar with regard to age, sex, CK peak, ejection fraction, end-systolic volume and risk factors. Plasma ET levels were measured at entry, and 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after starting thrombolysis. Mean concentrations of ET +/- SD: Group A basal, 1.50 +/- 0.67; at 2h, 2.31 +/- 1.24; 12 h, 1.84 +/- 1.45; 24 h, 1.30 +/- 0.72; 48 h, o.95 +/- 0.50; 72 h, 0.60 +/- 0.15 fmol/ml; p < 0.001. Group B basal, 1.58 +/- 0.83; at 2 h, 2.38 +/- 1.35; 12 h, 2.33 +/- 1.71; 24 h, 1.80 +/- 1.41; 48h, 1.46 +/- 0.88; 72 h, 0.93 +/- 0.44 fmol/ml; p < 0.001. Difference between the two groups was significant at the beginning of the test (between 2 and 12 h, p[=]0.002). After that, the values of the plasma endothelin decreased in parallel, p < 0.001. Our data suggest that captopril affects plasma ET levels in the acute and subacute phases of AMI. Moreover, these results provide additional evidence for a beneficial effect of early captopril treatment.", 
    "30": "The present study compares the occurrence of a dry, persistent cough with doses of 80 mg of valsartan, 10 mg of lisinopril, or 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide in patients with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough. This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group, multicenter trial involving 129 adult outpatients with essential hypertension. After confirmation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough during a 2 to 4 week challenge with lisinopril (followed by a washout period of 2 weeks), patients were randomized to receive 6 weeks of double-blind treatment once daily with 80 mg valsartan, 10 mg lisinopril, or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. Assessments were made at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Comparability of response to treatment was assessed by mean sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the end of treatment. The occurrence of a dry, persistent cough was significantly less (P < 0.001) at 3 and 6 weeks with valsartan (19.5%) than with lisinopril (68.9%), with no significant difference between valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (19.0%). There were no statistically significant differences in reduction of blood pressure among the three treatment groups. The overall incidence of adverse experiences, whether or not treatment-related, was highest for lisinopril (86.7%) compared with valsartan (57.1%), and hydrochlorothiazide (61.9%). A dry cough in the lisinopril group accounted for this difference. There were no clinically significant changes in physical signs or in results of clinical laboratory evaluations during double-blind treatment, except for from metabolic changes in 3 patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide. In hypertensive patients with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough, a single daily dose of 80 mg of valsartan produced therapeutic efficacy comparable to lisinopril but with significantly less cough.",

The Lyon diet heart study is a single-blind secondary prevention trial to test the hypothesis that a Mediterranean-type of diet may prevent recurrences after a first myocardial infarction. A surprising 73% reduction of the risk of new major cardiac events was observed in the experimental group. For this reason, it is important to describe the methods used in the trial. We now report our techniques to randomize the patients, to change their diet and to control for possible bias, in particular any investigator or attending physician bias.", 
    "32": "In this dietary trial, a specific design was used to recruit and randomize the patients without informing them and their physicians that they were participating in a comparative trial. The attending physician bias was evaluated by studying drug usage and the investigator bias by constructing a questionnaire from which specific scores were used to evaluate (1) how the patients appreciated their participation in the study and (2) whether this participation resulted in significant changes in their way of living.", 
    "33": "605 survivors of a first myocardial infarction were randomized into either a control or a Mediterranean group.", 
    "34": "The two randomized groups were similar for all the variables of prognosis. Drug usage was not significantly different between groups, suggesting that there was no major attending physician bias. Analyses of the appreciation scores and of the change score did not detect any significant investigator bias.",

    "36": "The spontaneously hypertensive fawn-hooded rat (FHH) develops accelerated albuminuria and focal glomerular sclerosis (FGS), leading to ESRD and shortening of lifespan. The FHH is characterized by moderate systemic hypertension, a relatively low afferent to efferent arteriolar resistance ratio, and glomerular hypertension. The FHH study presented here was designed to examine the efficacy of early-onset, late-onset, or early-temporary angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-i) in ameliorating long-term hypertension and FGS, and improving survival, as well as to relate its protective efficacy to preexistent FGS and to reduction of glomerular pressure (PGC) Untreated rats developed hypertension and high PGC, and all (N = 22) except one died of ESRD within the 72-wk follow-up period. Early-onset (at 7 wk of age) ACE-i prevented development of systemic and glomerular hypertension, and it largely prevented proteinuria and FGS; all rats survived throughout the follow-up period. Rats treated with late-onset (22 wk) ACE-i were hypertensive and proteinuric at the start of ACE-i, and they showed beginning FGS. ACE-i corrected the hypertension, albuminuria, and PGC but could not fully prevent some hypertension, albuminuria, and FGS at the later stage. Early-temporary (7 to 22 wk) ACE-i adequately controlled blood pressure and development of FGS during therapy, but after withdrawal of ACE-i, systemic and glomerular hypertension developed as in untreated animals. This regimen postponed but did not control FGS development and early mortality. The results of this study indicate that: (1) early-onset ACE-i very effectively protects against development of renal damage in the FHH; (2) this protection is associated with normalization of the elevated glomerular capillary pressure; (3) ACE-i cannot completely prevent further development of previously established FGS, despite lowering glomerular capillary pressure; (4) early-temporary ACE-i has no long-term controlling effect on arterial and glomerular pressure, and it cannot control development of FGS.", 
    "37": "The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study showed a beneficial effect of a lower-than-usual blood pressure (BP) goal on the progression of renal disease in patients with proteinuria. The purpose of the present analyses was to examine the achieved BP, baseline characteristics that helped or hindered achievement of the BP goals, and safety of the BP interventions. Five hundred eighty-five patients with baseline glomerular filtration rate between 13 and 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (0.22 to 0.92 mL/s per 1.73 m2) were randomly assigned to either a usual or low BP goal (mean arterial pressure < or = 107 or < or = 92 mm Hg, respectively). Few patients had a history of cardiovascular disease. All antihypertensive agents were permitted, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (with or without diuretics) followed by calcium channel blockers were preferred. The mean (+/- SD) of the mean arterial pressures during follow-up in the low and usual BP groups was 93.0 +/- 7.3 and 97.7 +/- 7.7 mm Hg, respectively. Follow-up BP was significantly higher in subgroups of patients with preexisting hypertension, baseline mean arterial pressure > 92 mm Hg, a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease or glomerular diseases, baseline urinary protein excretion > 1 g/d, age > or = 61 years, and black race. The frequency of medication changes and incidence of symptoms of low BP were greater in the low BP group, but there were no significant differences between BP groups in stop points, hospitalizations, or death. When data from both groups were combined, each 1-mm Hg increase in follow-up systolic BP was associated with a 1.35-times greater risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Lower BP than usually recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular disease is achievable by several medication regimens without serious adverse effects in patients with chronic renal disease without cardiovascular disease. For patients with urinary protein excretion > 1 g/d, target BP should be a mean arterial pressure of < or = 92 mm Hg, equivalent to 125/75 mm Hg.", 
    "38": "The combination of single oral doses of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) and a type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan) has additive effects on blood pressure fall and renin release in sodium-depleted normotensive subjects. We planned the present study to determine whether the magnitude of the hemodynamic and hormonal consequences of renin-angiotensin system blockade by such a combination is larger than that obtained by doubling the dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor given alone. In a single-dose, double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover study, 10 mg enalapril, 20 mg enalapril, and the combination of 50 mg losartan and 10 mg enalapril were administered orally to 12 sodium-depleted normotensive subjects. The area under the time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) of the mean blood pressure fall after losartan-enalapril combination intake (-220 +/- 91 mm Hg.h) was significantly greater than that of either 10 or 20 mg enalapril (-124 +/- 91 and -149 +/- 85 mm Hg.h, respectively, P < .05 vs both doses). The combination significantly increased by 2.3 +/- 1.2-fold the AUC0-24 of plasma active renin compared with either 10 or 20 mg enalapril given alone (P < .05) but had no additive effect on plasma aldosterone fall. The losartan-enalapril combination is more effective in decreasing blood pressure and increasing plasma active renin than doubling of the enalapril dose.", 
    "39": "To evaluate the role of the renin gene in the development of hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats (SS/Jr/Hsd), we derived a congenic strain of rats homozygous for the salt-resistant renin allele (S/renrr) and compared them with a control strain homozygous for the salt-sensitive renin allele (S/ren(ss). Mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in 12-week-old S/renrr rats fed a high salt (8.0%) diet for 3 weeks than in S/ren(ss) rats or in SS/Jr/Hsd rats rederived from the foundation colony we used to generate the cogenic strain (195 +/- 3 [n = 49] versus 168 +/- 3 [n = 17] or 161 +/- 3 [n = 16] mm Hg). Mean arterial pressure was also higher in S/renrr rats than in S/ren(ss) rats raised from birth on either a very low salt (0.1%) diet (119 +/- 9 [n = 6] versus 100 +/- 7 [n = 7] mm Hg) or a low salt (0.4%) diet (143 +/- 1 [n = 22] versus 117 +/- 3 [n = 10] mm Hg). Plasma renin activity of S/renrr rats was significantly higher than that of S/ren(ss) rats fed a very low salt diet (5.7 +/- 2.0 versus 1.8 +/- 0.3) ng angiotensin l/mL per hour), a low salt diet (4.4 +/- 1.0 versus 1.1 +/- 0.3), or a high salt diet (1.5 +/- 0.2 versus 0.9 +/- 0.1). Urinary protein excretion was greater in S/renrr rats than in S/ren(ss) rats fed a high salt diet (244.2 +/- 48.5 versus 43.6 +/- 19.5 mg/24 h), and this was associated with significant reductions in renal blood flow (3.3 +/- 0.6 versus 4.6 +/- 0.5 mL/min per gram kidney weight) and glomerular filtration rate (0.49 +/- 0.11 versus 0.82 +/- 0.08 mL/min per gram kidney weight). Captopril (20 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on blood pressure in S/ren(ss) rats fed a low salt diet, but it lowered blood pressure by 20 mm Hg in S/ren(rr) rats to the same level seen in untreated S/ren(ss) rats. Chronic administration of captopril (5 mg/100 mL drinking water) reduced blood pressure in S/renrr rats fed a high salt diet (170 +/- 5 mm Hg) to the same level seen in untreated S/ren(ss) rats, whereas it had no significant effect on blood pressure in S/ren(ss) rats. These results indicate that transfer of a salt-resistant renin allele to SS/Jr/Hsd rats raises plasma renin activity and augments the severity of hypertension and renal disease.", 
    "40": "A simple and direct method using an N-methylpyridinium polymer-based (4VP-Me) column for the detection of the human serum albumin (HSA)-captopril (Cp) conjugate was developed. By this method, a new peak corresponding to an HSA-Cp conjugate was detected in the serum from a patient receiving Cp. The new peak was composed of a 1:1 molar ratio of Cp and HSA. Time courses of reversible and irreversible binding of Cp to HSA were quite different. The reversible binding decreased rapidly, whereas covalent binding increased gradually. A mechanism is proposed for the formation of the HSA-Cp conjugate and, based on this mechanism, apparent first-order rate constants were calculated. Interestingly, the reactivity in serum was approximately 10-fold higher than that obtained for HSA solutions. The differences in this reaction between serum and HSA solution might be due to the fluctuations in pH as well as the presence of endogenous thiol compounds, oxygen, and metal ions in the solutions.", 
    "41": "The results of a drug use evaluation of lisinopril at a large teaching military medical center are reported. Indicators and thresholds were developed and approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The medical charts of 227 patients for whom lisinopril was prescribed from June 1991 to June 1992 were reviewed for appropriateness of prescribing, appropriateness of monitoring, occurrence of any adverse drug reactions, and detection of drug interactions. Prescribing was appropriate in 97% and monitoring was appropriate in all reviewed cases. The most common adverse drug reactions detected were cough (7%), hypotension (3%), and rash (2%). Patients were also prescribed several drugs that may interact with lisinopril. Lisinopril appeared to be well tolerated and efficacious. Forty patients (18%) experienced adverse drug reactions related to lisinopril. There did not appear to be any major deficiencies with lisinopril prescribing and no corrective action needed to be taken other than educational activities for the appropriate use of lisinopril. Information from this drug use evaluation is useful in formulary decision making.", 
    "42": "The purpose of this study was to determine long-term role of nitric oxide in modulating the chronic renal and arterial pressure responses to angiotensin II (AII). In normal dogs, intrarenal AII infusion (1.0 ng/KG/min) decreased renal plasma flow (RPF) by 31% and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 17% and increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 22%. In dogs with chronic intrarenal NO synthesis blockade with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (3 micrograms/kg/min), AII decreased RPF by 25% and GFR by 19%, and increased MAP by 7%. These data indicate that chronic inhibition of NO synthesis within the kidney attenuated the long-term renal and arterial pressure responses by AII in dogs.", 
    "43": "We have studied the effects of chronic therapy with cicaprost (a PGI2 analog), fosinopril (a converting enzyme inhibitor), and the combination of both drugs on the progression of experimental diabetic nephropathy. Uninephrectomized streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were maintained for 8 months with plasma glucose between 13.7 and 22.0 mmol/L to hasten renal damage. Systemic and renal parameters were measured periodically, and at sacrifice structural and morphometrical renal studies were performed to evaluate diabetic injury. Control rats exhibited characteristic features of this model, such as high blood pressure and plasma creatinine and urinary albumin excretion, together with prominent alterations in the kidney (renal and glomerular hypertrophies, mesangial matrix expansion, and tubular alterations). The three therapies attenuated equivalently the progression of diabetic renal injury, as estimated by lower urinary albumin excretion, renal and glomerular hypertrophies, and a better renal architectural preservation. No synergistic action was appreciated with the combined therapy. However, renal preservation achieved with cicaprost was not linked to reductions in systemic blood pressure, whereas in the groups treated with fosinopril the hypotensive effect of this drug could have contributed to the positive outcome of the therapy. Therefore, nephroprotection exerted by this PGI2 analog in this model seems more related to the derangement of renal local mechanisms than to systemic blood pressure control. Finally, the possibility that an impaired prostacyclin synthesis or bioavailability is involved in the pathogenesis of the diabetic nephropathy in this model underlies our results.", 
    "44": "Mibefradil is a novel calcium antagonist that blocks selectively the T-type calcium channels. In this double-blind forced titration study design we compared the effects of mibefradil 50, 100, and 150 mg and nifedipine GITS 30, 60, and 90 mg monotherapies or combined with lisinopril 20 mg in 71 moderate to severe hypertensives (59 men and 12 women) with confirmed ambulatory hypertension. An incremental dose-response effect was observed both in clinic and ambulatory blood pressure parameters during treatment with mibefradil and nifedipine GITS alone and combined with lisinopril. At maximal dosage, patients treated with mibefradil experienced a greater (P < .05) reduction in clinic and ambulatory diastolic blood pressures as well as a greater response rate (86% v 69%). Trough:peak ratios for systolic and diastolic blood pressures were > 90% at each dose level. Significant decrease in baseline heart rate was observed with mibefradil 150 mg alone or combined with lisinopril, but no patients experienced clinically significant atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. Adverse events related to vasodilation were more prevalent in the nifedipine GITS group. Consequently, the results of the present study demonstrate that the novel calcium channel blocker mibefradil, either alone or in combination with lisinopril, is effective in reducing clinic and 24-h blood pressures while decreasing heart rate and is well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "45": "The present analysis was undertaken to investigate the relations between alterations in mineral factors, especially the balance between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (S-Ca and S-Mg, respectively), and variables reflecting glucose and lipid metabolism during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment. A total of 96 patients with essential hypertension, participating in four double-blind studies with four different ACE inhibitors and similar protocols, were included. At the end of the initial placebo period and at the end of the period of active drug treatment, a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test was carried out, lipoprotein status was assessed, and the concentrations of serum electrolytes were measured. The serum ACE activity was determined in the group treated with fosinopril. Changes in insulin sensitivity index (M/I) were directly correlated to alterations in S-Mg (r = 0.24, P < .02), and inversely correlated to changes in S-Ca (r = -0.19, P = .07) and the ratio between serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (Ca/Mg) (r = -0.27, P < .008). The change in total serum triglycerides (S-Tg) was inversely correlated to the change in S-Mg (r = -0.35, P < .0005), and directly correlated to the change in Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0.36, P < .0004). The reduction in serum ACE activity correlated to a more pronounced increase in S-Mg r = -0.62, P < .002), and decrease in the Ca/Mg ratio (r = 0.73, P = .0002). We conclude that the changes in the studied metabolic variables and serum ACE activity during ACE inhibitor treatment are related to alterations in mineral status and the balance between calcium and magnesium concentrations in serum.", 
    "46": "Continued treatment of hypertensive patients with enalapril reduced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy steadily over a period of 5 years (by which time gross structural parameters were normal) and produced no further reduction during the following 2 years. Temporary suspension of treatment after 5-year follow-up gave rise to an increase in blood pressure, and to deterioration of LV isovolumic relaxation time and deceleration of the ventricular filling E wave, both of which chiefly reflect the active relaxation of the ventricle.", 
    "47": "This study was designed to investigate the possible mechanisms whereby enalapril improves cardiac function and mortality in chronic heart failure. We explored potential mechanisms by following 41 patients with early heart failure over the course of 1 year. These patients were randomized in a prospective triple-blind manner to receive either enalapril or placebo. Over the 1 year, repeated measurements were obtained of echocardiographic parameters, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, hematocrit, plasma neurohormones, and QTc dispersion. Echocardiographic parameters improved with enalapril but deteriorated with placebo (cardiac output 4.6 +/- 1.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 L/min with placebo, and 4.5 +/- 1.3 to 5.8 +/- 2.0 L/min with enalapril; p <0.01). In contrast, there were no significant changes in renal blood flow (518 +/- 185 to 509 +/- 180 ml/min/1.73 m2 with placebo, and 541 +/- 142 to 504 +/- 162 ml/min/1.73 m2 with enalapril). Glomerular filtration rate changed from 79 +/- 20 to 78 +/- 19 ml/min/1.73 m2 with placebo, and from 85 +/- 21 to 73 +/- 27 ml/min/1.73 m2 with enalapril (p = 0.051). Enalapril reduced hematocrit (0.414 +/- 0.041 to 0.377 +/- 0.040%) significantly more than placebo (0.420 +/- 0.029 to 0.411 +/- 0.023 l/l; p <0.01). In addition, enalapril produced a marked reduction in QTc dispersion (93 +/- 36 to 88 +/- 28 ms with placebo and 93 +/- 35 to 60 +/- 22 ms with enalapril; p <0.05). Thus, enalapril significantly reduced hematocrit and reduced QTc dispersion in early heart failure. Both of these effects, but especially the latter, could be an important mechanism for the reduced mortality seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure. In contrast, renal hemodynamics did not parallel either the placebo-induced deterioration in cardiac function or the enalapril-induced improvements in cardiac function.", 
    "48": "Crossbridge properties of cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster (CSH) diaphragm from the dilated Bio 53-58 strain were analyzed after 5-mo of treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (1 mg/kg/d by oral gavage). Three groups were studied: control F1B hamsters (C; n = 14); CSH given placebo (PL; n = 11 ); and perindopril-treated CSH (PE; n = 11). Peak isometric tension was lower in PL than in C, in both twitch (21.4 +/- 1.5 versus 46.9 +/- 1.5 mN/mm2; p < 0.001) and tetanus (41.0 +/- 2.7 versus 90.5 +/- 3.3 mN/mm2; p < 0.001). In PE, peak isometric tension was intermediate between C and PL, and was significantly lower than in C and higher than in PL. The single force of one crossbridge (pi), the number (m) of crossbridges, the turnover rate of myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (kcat), and peak mechanical efficiency (Effmax) were calculated from A.F. Huxley's equations; m was lower in PL than in C, in both twitch (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 4.9 +/- 0.2 10(9)/mm2; p < 0.001) and tetanus (4.0 +/- 0.3 versus 8.9 +/- 0.7 10(9)/mm2; p < 0.001); m was higher in PE than in PL, in both twitch 4.3 +/- 0.5 versus 3.4 +/- 0.2 10(9)/mm2; NS) and tetanus (6.2 +/- 0.4 versus 4.0 +/- 0.3 10(9)/mm2; p < 0.01), with no change in pi. In the three groups, Effmax correlated linearly with kcat (r = 0.93; p = 0.001) and showed a negative linear correlation with pi (r = 0.996; p = 0.001). In conclusion, our results show that in experimental cardiomyopathy, ACE inhibitor mainly helps to prevent a decrease in the number of diaphragm muscle crossbridges, resulting in preserved peak isometric tension.", 
    "49": "It has been suggested that hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance may be a pathogenetic factor common to obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and hypertension. Furthermore, beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics have been shown to be capable of increasing insulin resistance and thus of inducing NIDDM in predisposed individuals. We used the minimal model approach (MMA) to glucose metabolism and insulin kinetics to compare peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in hypertensive and normotensive obese men. The hypertensive group consisted of 37 obese men with mild to moderate hypertension; following a drug-free period of 4 weeks, 20 of these subjects received diltiazem and 17 quinapril over the 12-week study period. The normotensive (control) group contained 17 obese men without microalbuminuria, dyslipidemia, or a family history of essential hypertension or NIDDM. Before and at the end of the 12-week study period, subjects underwent frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT) tests. The results were used to estimate an insulin sensitivity index (S(I)), a glucose effectiveness index (S(G)), and beta-cell sensitivity to glucose indices during first- and second-phase insulin secretion (phi1 and phi2) using the minimal models of glucose metabolism and insulin kinetics. No significant differences in S(I) or S(G) were detected between the hypertensive and control groups. Twelve weeks' treatment with diltiazem led to a slight but significant increase in phi1; however, neither diltiazem nor quinapril had significant effects on S(I) or S(G). We conclude that men with obesity and hypertension have no greater insulin resistance than those with obesity alone, suggesting that hypertension is not generally associated with any significant increase in insulin resistance. Treatment with diltiazem or quinapril does not have undesirable effects on glucose metabolism. However, treatment with diltiazem led to a significant increase in beta-cell sensitivity to glucose; this is of particular interest, given the importance of phi1 for peripheral glucose uptake.", 
    "50": "In addition to the goal of controlling elevated blood pressure in patients with hypertension improving Dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance may be an important element in preventing coronary artery disease. Antihypertensive treatment may differ based on the pathophysiology present. It appears that the evidence that supports the development of lipid abnormalities in patients who have insulin resistance is growing. In such patients the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease may be significantly decreased by selecting agents with favourable metabolic consequences.", 
    "51": "Dietary sodium restriction has several clinical benefits, particularly that of enhancing the antihypertensive action of diuretics and other blood pressure-lowering drugs. In individuals who form hypercalciuric stones, sodium restriction along with thiazide diuretics helps to reduce urinary calcium. However, there are adverse consequences of sodium restriction, particularly in elderly patients with impaired sodium conservation mechanisms. Ischemic and nephrotoxic injuries are induced more readily in sodium-depleted animals and patients because of impaired renal hemodynamics and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Acute renal failure can be precipitated by sodium restriction and concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and immunosuppressive drugs. Dietary sodium restriction in animals enhances the chronic nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus, whereas similar doses of these drugs do not produce structural damage in salt-replete animals. Maneuvers that block angiotensin II protect against renal scarring and drug-induced arteriolopathy in this model. Sodium restriction can enhance the renal tubular reabsorption of drugs such as lithium, leading to toxic blood concentrations. Calcium antagonists may have better efficacy when prescribed to salt-replete hypertensive persons. Finally, there is evidence that activation of the renin-angiotensin system by sodium depletion will enhance the growth of cysts in animal models of cystic renal disease. In individual patients, the effects of sodium restriction by diet should balance anticipated benefits against any possible adverse consequences.", 
    "52": "In several models of renal disease progression, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced proteinuria and limited glomerulosclerosis, which suggested that reduction of renal angiotensin II (Ang II) activity is crucial for the preservation of glomerular structure and function. However, it cannot be ruled out that other hormonal systems, including inhibition of the bradykinin breakdown, also play a role. We compared the effects of chronic treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with those of a specific Ang II receptor antagonist, L-158,809, on proteinuria and renal injury in passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), a model of immune renal disease that closely resembles human membranous nephropathy, with long-lasting proteinuria followed by tubulointerstitial damage and glomerulosclerosis. Passive Heymann nephritis was induced with 0.5 mL/100 g of rabbit anti-Fx1A antibody in 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were divided into three groups of eight rats each, and were given the following in the drinking water on a daily basis: lisinopril (40 mg/L), L-158,809 (50 mg/L), or no therapy. Treatment started at day 7 (proteinuria was already present) and lasted 12 months. Eight normal rats were used as controls. Untreated PHN rats developed hypertension, while rats with PHN given lisinopril or L-158,809 all had systolic blood pressure values even lower than those of normal rats. Urinary protein excretion progressively increased with time in untreated PHN rats, who developed tubulointerstitial damage and glomerulosclerosis. Both lisinopril and L-158,809 exhibited a potent antiproteinuric effect and preserved glomerular and tubular structural integrity at a similar extent. Renal gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta and extracellular matrix proteins was also effectively reduced by the two treatments. These results indicate that ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists are equally effective in preventing renal injury in PHN and suggest that the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors in this model are solely due to inhibition of Ang II.", 
    "53": "This study was performed to evaluate the role of human microenvironmental cells in the metabolism of AcSDKP, a physiological inhibitor of hematopoietic stem cells. Using long-term marrow cultures (LTMCs), whose medium already contained a baseline value of AcSDKP, we found after 2 weeks a net output in the culture supernatant indicating that release by cells from the adherent layer was superior to consumption of the peptide. Since human microenvironmental cells consist of macrophages and vascular smooth-muscle-like stromal cells we generated pure populations of macrophages (by culturing cord blood cells in the presence of granulomonocytic colony-stimulating factor) and of stromal cells (generated by stromal colonies). We found in supernatants of macrophage cultures a significantly (p < 0.01) increased level of AcSDKP (compared with value in medium) while in supernatants of stromal cell cultures the level was decreased. Cell content of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in stromal cells was higher than in macrophages, which suggests a degradation of AcSDKP by stromal cells because of their higher amount of ACE. Finally, we analyzed the content of AcSDKP in adherent layers of LTMCs (with or without extracellular matrix [ECM] components), macrophages, and stromal cells. We found levels of AcSDKP of 1.5 pMol per 106 cells in extracts from macrophages or from stromal cells. On the contrary, extracts from primary layers of LTMCs contained 3 times more AcSDKP; however, after treatment of primary layers by collagenase, AcSDKP level fell to 1 pMol per 10(6) cells. Immunofluorescence using an anti-AcSDKP monoclonal antibody showed an extracellular network in certain areas of LTMCs. This study shows that 1) macrophages synthesize and release in the supernatant AcSDKP, 2) stromal cells probably degrade the peptide via ACE, and 3) components of the ECM from LTMCs serve as a reservoir for the peptide. These results are reminiscent of what has been described for growth factors, produced by microenvironmental cells, and stored in the ECM in close vicinity to hematopoietic precursors.", 
    "54": "We sought to investigate the effects of mibefradil on survival, hemodynamic variables and cardiac remodeling in a rat model of chronic heart failure (HF) and to compare these effects with those of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril.", 
    "55": "The use of calcium channel blocking agents in chronic HF has been disappointing. Most studies have shown that these drugs have either no or even detrimental effects due in part to the negative inotropic effects they induce. Mibefradil is a calcium channel blocker that selectively blocks T channels and displays moderately negative inotropic properties only at high doses. Because T channels are upregulated in the hypertrophied heart and could mediate hypertrophic signals and increase arrhythmogenicity, blockade of these channels might be beneficial in chronic HF.", 
    "56": "Rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation and 9 months of treatment with mibefradil (15 mg/kg body weight per day) or cilazapril (10 mg/kg per day) or no treatment. Survival and systolic blood pressure were assessed over the 9-month treatment period, after which cardiac hemodynamic variables and structure were determined.", 
    "57": "Mibefradil increased survival rate to the same extent as cilazapril (71% for mibefradil vs. 75% for cilazapril and 44% for no treatment). Mibefradil decreased systolic blood pressure, although to a lesser extent than cilazapril. Both treatments decreased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and central venous pressures, without any change in the first derivative of LV pressure over time or heart rate. Mibefradil decreased LV weight (although less than cilazapril) without affecting right ventricular weight. Finally, both drugs normalized LV collagen density.", 
    "58": "Mibefradil in a rat model improved survival to the same extent as an ACE inhibitor, without impairing LV function, and was associated with a reduction in LV weight and fibrosis. Thus, mibefradil might be beneficial in the treatment of chronic HF.", 
    "59": "This study assessed whether treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in addition to the use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril decreases cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI) and whether the presence of neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge predicts the effects of beta-blocker treatment in these patients.", 
    "60": "Both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects in patients with left ventricular dysfunction but no overt heart failure after MI. These patients often have persistent neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge, and one would expect that patients with activation of the sympathetic nervous system derive the most benefit from treatment with beta-blockers. However, beta-blockers are underutilized in this high risk group of patients, and it is unknown whether their beneficial effects are additive to those of ACE inhibitors.",

The relations between beta-blocker use at the time of randomization and neurohumoral activation and the subsequent development of cardiovascular events were analyzed by use of Cox proportional hazards models controlling for covariates.", 
    "62": "After adjustment for baseline imbalances, beta-blocker use was associated with a significant reduction in risk of cardiovascular death (30%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12% to 44%) and development of heart failure (21%, 95% CI 3% to 36%), but the reduction in recurrent MI (11%, 95% CI 13% to 31%) was not significant. These reductions were independent of the use of captopril. Beta-blockers were not found to have a greater effect in patients with neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge.", 
    "63": "The beneficial effects of beta-blocker use at the time of hospital discharge in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after MI appear to be additive to those of captopril and other interventions known to improve prognosis. Neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge fails to identify those patients who will derive the greatest benefit from treatment with beta-blockers.", 
    "64": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is beneficial for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. However, it is unclear how complete the blockade by ACE inhibitors is and if there is continuing angiotensin II (Ang II) formation during chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors. Indeed chymase, a serine protease, which is able to form angiotensin II from angiotensin I (Ang I) and cannot be blocked by ACE inhibitors, has been shown to be present in human heart. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the extent of renin-angiotensin system blockade and the Ang II-forming pathways in cardiac tissue of patients chronically treated with ACE inhibitors or in patients without ACE inhibition therapy. Our studies indicate an incomplete ACE inhibition in human heart tissue after chronic ACE inhibitor therapy. Moreover, ACE contributes only a small portion to the total Ang I conversion, as shown in biochemical studies in ventricular and coronary homogenates or functionally as Ang I contractions in isolated rings of coronary arteries. A serine protease was responsible for the majority of Ang II production in both the membrane preparation and Ang I-induced contractions of isolated coronary arteries. In humans, the serine protease pathway is likely to play an important role in cardiac Ang II formation. Thus, drugs such as renin inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers might be able to induce a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, providing a more efficacious therapy.",

    "66": "Male Wistar rats were used. Group 1 (G1) received a medium (i.e. olive oil) only, group 2 (G2) received CsA (30 mg./kg./d) only, group 3 (G3) received both CsA (30 mg./kg./d) and Tem (80 micrograms./kg./d), and group 4 (G4) received Tem (80 micrograms./kg./d) only. Each group consisted of 5 animals. Drugs were given orally for fourteen days. Then, renal cortical blood flow (RCBF) and concentrations of serum creatinine (S-Cr), serum potassium (S-K), whole blood CsA (WB-CsA), serum aldosterone (Ald), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured. The creatinine clearance (CCr) was also calculated. Kidneys were processed to the light microscopic examination with Bowie stain, and the size of the renin granules (S-RGs) was estimated by an image analysis system.", 
    "67": "G2 showed a decrease of RCBF (p < 0.01), an increase of S-Cr (p < 0.01), a decrease of CCr (p < 0.01), an increase of S-K (p < 0.05), and an increase of S-RGs (p < 0.01). Compared with G2, G3 showed significant improvement in RCBF (p < 0.01) and S-Cr (p < 0.05), but still showed significant impairments in all indices (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05, vs control). G4 showed no remarkable changes comparing with G1, except a significant (p < 0.01, vs. control) increase of S-K. G3 showed additional effect on the increase of S-K (p < 0.01, vs. control and G2). Tem showed no significant influence on the WB-CsA level. The serum Ald and PRA levels were not significantly changed by these drugs.", 
    "68": "These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles (AAs) is a principal mechanism of CsA-NT. The increase of RGs may be the result of both increased production and inhibited secretion of renin.", 
    "69": "Immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect Fos in the brain following subcutaneous administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril or enalapril at 0.5 mg/kg to conscious rats. Increased Fos-like immunoreactivity was observed in many neurons in the lamina terminalis, and in regions of the hypothalamus. Captopril at this dose also caused water drinking in other rats. Pre-treatment with the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist ZD7155 (10 mg/kg) given subcutaneously prevented the captopril-induced increase in Fos in the lamina terminalis. This dose of ZD7155 also prevented captopril-induced drinking in other rats. With a higher dose (50 mg/kg) of captopril or enalapril, there was no increase in Fos in the lamina terminalis. This dose of captopril was not dipsogenic. The results are consistent with the proposal that the lower dose (0.5 mg/kg) of captopril or enalapril increases circulating angiotensin I levels which are then converted to angiotensin II in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and subfornical organ. Stimulation of neurons at these sites may subserve water drinking and sodium appetite.", 
    "70": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and specific nonpeptide angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor antagonists have been used extensively to treat a variety of cardiovascular disorders in experimental animals and humans. Despite their widespread use, only a limited amount of data has been published regarding the effect that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade may have on ANG II receptors, and very often this information is contradictory. The present study was designed to investigate whether changes in plasma ANG II levels induced by RAS blockade could alter glomerular ANG II receptor characteristics. Captopril was employed as an ACE-I with losartan and TCV-116, two AT1 receptor antagonists of different chemical structure. Two experimental protocols were established. Protocol 1 contained 3 experimental groups: controls (Sprague-Dawley rats, 250-300 g BW), and animals treated with either captopril (0.5 g/l via drinking water) or losartan (10 mg/kg BW p.o.). In protocol 2, the animals were treated as in protocol 1 except that losartan was replaced by TCV-116 (1 mg/kg BW p.o.). At the end of treatment (3 days), all groups were killed by decapitation, blood was collected for plasma renin activity (PRA) measurement, and hearts and kidneys were excised. ANG II receptors were assessed by radioligand binding assays on membrane preparations of purified glomeruli, by displacement of 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]-ANG II with specific nonpeptide antagonists of AT1 (losartan) and AT2 (PD 123319) receptor subtypes. RAS blockade by either ACE-I or AT1 antagonists increased PRA. The binding assays showed that renal glomeruli from treated rats and controls expressed a single population (AT1) of ANG II receptors. The density of glomerular AT1 receptors was not modulated by captopril, but was significantly lower in animals treated with either losartan (Bmax: 854 +/- 169 vs. 379 +/- 79 fmol/mg protein and Kd: 59 +/- 6 vs. 45 +/- 6 nM for controls and losartan, respectively) or TCV-116 (480 +/- 72 vs. 188 +/- 16 fmol/mg protein and Kd: 45 +/- 9 vs. 37 +/- 18 nM for controls and TCV-116, respectively) than in their controls. No changes in receptor affinity (Kd) were detected. Previous membrane \"acid-wash\" did not modify the results. We conclude that short-term RAS blockade by AT1 antagonists, but not by ACE-I, induces true downregulation of renal glomerular ANG II receptors. No AT2 receptor subtype was detected.", 
    "71": "Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most frequent causes of chronic renal failure worldwide. Altogether, 35% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and a somewhat smaller percentage of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ultimately develop diabetic kidney disease. Early diagnosis is of utmost importance since the development of diabetic nephropathy affects the general health, the carbohydrate metabolism of the patient, moreover it aggravates hypertension and accelerates atherosclerosis. Microalbuminuria is a sensitive but relatively late marker of diabetic kidney disease. Still, screening of diabetic patients for microalbuminuria is of great importance since there is no other screening test capable of diagnosing diabetic nephropathy at an earlier stage. The description of the genetic substrate of susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease would revolutionize the diagnosis and prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Until then, compliance with therapeutic guidelines outlined in milestone clinical studies of the last years may significantly decrease morbidity, the progression of, and the mortality associated with diabetic kidney disease.", 
    "72": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the determination of free captopril in human plasma N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was used as an internal standard. Plasma samples were immediately derivatized with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (NPM) and stabilized with 11 M HCl. The drug of interest was isolated using a liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and separation was obtained using a reversed-phase column under isocratic conditions with fluorescence detection. The sample volume was 150 microliters plasma. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision, determined as relative error and coefficient of variation respectively, were less than 10%. The lower limit of quantitation, based on standards with acceptable coefficients of variation, was 25 ng/ml. No endogenous compounds were found to interfere. The linearity was assessed in the range of 25-600 ng/ml. This method has been demonstrated to be suitable for pharmacokinetic studies in humans.", 
    "73": "Authors investigated the effect of enalapril (10-20 mg daily) on twenty-nine patients with chronic heart failure in NYHA III-IV stadium who's ejection fraction value was under 40% and had restrictive type of diastolic filling abnormality. Parameters of left ventricular function were measured by echocardiography and the basal data were compared to data detected at the time of 3 and 6 months control. A beneficial effect of enalapril was found on functional cardiac status (reduction in NYHA score), on systolic function (augmentation in ejection fraction and mean mitral anulus motion amplitude). Parallel with the previous parameters in the severity of restrictive diastolic filling alterations (reducing the value of pathologically high E/A ratio and an increasing in deceleration time of early diastolic filling wave) a countable decrease was observed. Authors emphasize the favourable effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on chronic heart failure caused by different reasons independently of its severity. The source of drug action is reduction of the preload and afterload as well as keeping under control the harmful ventricular remodelling based on impediment of myocardial angiotensin system.", 
    "74": "The hypothesis that sympathetic nerve system modulates a specific frequency range of blood pressure fluctuation was tested by electrical stimulation of the medullary sympathetic excitatory sites in anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized, cardiac sympathetic blocked, baroreceptor transected and angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibited rats. The frequency tested ranged from 0.02 to 1.7 Hz. For blood pressure fluctuation within this range there was no specific sympathetic reactive zone. Instead, low frequency fluctuation of sympathetic flow produced blood pressure fluctuation of the same frequency. Transfer magnitude of renal sympathetic activity to blood pressure decrease logarithmically with the increase of stimulation frequency. The relationship between the sympathetic spectral power (P(SND), (microV.s)2/Hz) and the blood pressure spectral power (P(BP), mmHg2/Hz) was found as P(BP)=10(1.3) x P(SND) x 10(-4.7x(frequency)). This transfer function demonstrates that when blood pressure fluctuation is used to estimate the sympathetic activity, it should be frequency weighted.", 
    "75": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors early after an acute myocardial infarction to reduce mortality has been studied in several trials with inconsistent results. Aspirin (ASA) has become a well-documented therapeutic adjunct in patients with coronary heart disease. Attention has recently been focused on a possible interaction between ASA and ACE inhibitors. We therefore reanalyzed data from the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study II (CONSENSUS II) to find any evidence of differential effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril in subgroups defined by use of ASA at baseline. Logistic regression tested the multiplicative interaction. We used Rothman synergy index S, which would be equal to unity under additivity, and less than unity when suggesting antagonism, to examine the postulated interaction with departure from an additive model. Logistic regression showed that the enalapril-ASA interaction term was a significant predictor of mortality at the end of the study (p = 0.047), and was a borderline significant predictor of mortality 30 days after randomization (p = 0.085). The Rothman synergy index S was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.94) for mortality at the end of the study, and 0.68 ( 0.44 to 1.04) for 30-day mortality, indicating antagonism between enalapril and ASA with departure from an additive model. Thus, we found evidence of enalapril-ASA interaction. The effect of enalapril was less favorable among patients taking ASA than among patients not taking ASA at baseline.", 
    "76": "A diverse range of membrane proteins of Type 1 or Type II topology also occur as a circulating, soluble form. These soluble forms are often derived from the membrane form by proteolysis by a group of enzymes referred to collectively as 'secretases' or 'sheddases'. The cleavage generally occurs close to the extracellular face of the membrane, releasing physiologically active protein. This secretion process also provides a mechanism for down-regulating the protein at the cell surface. Examples of such post-translational proteolysis are seen in the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein, the vasoregulatory enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme, transforming growth factor-alpha, the tumour necrosis factor ligand and receptor superfamilies, certain cytokine receptors, and others. Since the proteins concerned are involved in pathophysiological processes such as neurodegeneration, apoptosis, oncogenesis and inflammation, the secretases could provide novel therapeutic targets. Recent characterization of these individual secretases has revealed common features, particularly sensitivity to certain metalloprotease inhibitors and upregulation of activity by phorbol esters. It is therefore likely that a closely related family of metallosecretases controls the surface expression of multiple integral membrane proteins. Current knowledge of the various secretases are compared in this Review, and strategies for cell-free assays of such proteases are outlined as a prelude to their ultimate purification and cloning.", 
    "77": "The long-term administration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, produces coronary vascular remodeling and myocardial hypertrophy in animals. This study used a rat model to investigate the role of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) in the pathogenesis of such changes. We studied the following groups, all of which received drug treatment in their drinking water: untreated controls, and those administered L-NAME, L-NAME, and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI), and L-NAME and hydralazine. Cardiovascular structural changes and tissue ACE activities were evaluated after the first, fourth, and eighth week of treatment. In rats treated with L-NAME alone, vascular remodeling was evident at the fourth and eighth week, and myocardial hypertrophy was present at the eighth week of treatment. The vascular and myocardial remodeling were characterized by increased tissue ACE activities and immunodetectable ACE in those tissues. These changes were markedly reduced by ACEI, but not by hydralazine treatment. Increased local ACE expression may thus be important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular remodeling in this model.", 
    "78": "This study compared the effect of benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to valsartan, an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, on glucose tolerance in the conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rat. Intraperitoneal infusion of benazepril or valsartan at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg per day produced equivalent dose-related reductions in systolic blood pressure for 12 weeks. Body weight gain during the treatment period was significantly reduced by infusion rates of benazepril. In contrast, only the highest infusion rate of valsartan significantly affected body weight gain. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, neither benazepril nor valsartan significantly affected glucose disposal during intravenous glucose tolerance tests. The insulin response to glucose challenge was unaffected by valsartan whereas following the highest infusion rate of benazepril the plasma levels were significantly reduced. The results demonstrate that benazepril but not valsartan reduces the insulin required to dispose of a glucose load.", 
    "79": "-Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can limit mortality and the occurrence of cardiac failure after myocardial infarction because they interfere with the ventricular remodelling process. ACE inhibitors also have anti-arrhythmic and possibly anti-ischaemic potency and therefore a primary cardioprotective effect. It is not advised to treat all patients with a myocardial infarction with an ACE inhibitor, but patients with a large anterior wall infarct, with heart failure or who had a previous infarct should be treated. After three months, the remodelling process can be reevaluated. The ACE inhibitor can be discontinued if the left ventricular function has strongly improved. There is no preference for a particular ACE inhibitor.", 
    "80": "Vascular expression of the endothelin-1 gene may be associated with severe vascular hypertrophy. Because in rats, inhibition of NO synthase with the L-arginine analogue N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induces blood pressure elevation associated with little cardiovascular hypertrophy, we studied vascular endothelin-1 gene expression in L-NAME-treated rats and the effects of chronic endothelin antagonism.", 
    "81": "Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg.kg-1.d-1 L-NAME in their drinking water for 3 weeks. Systolic blood pressure rose to 189 +/- 3 mm Hg (P < .001 versus control rats). By Northern blot analysis, endothelin-1 mRNA levels were similar in aortas and mesenteric arteries of control and L-NAME-treated rats. The blood pressure of L-NAME hypertensive rats treated with the ETA-selective endothelin receptor antagonist A-127722 for 3 weeks at a low dose (10 mg.kg-1.d-1) and a high dose (30 mg.kg-1.d-1) was not different from that of rats receiving L-NAME but not the endothelin antagonist. Treatment with the ACE inhibitor cilazapril lowered the blood pressure of L-NAME-treated rats equally whether or not they were receiving the ETA antagonist.", 
    "82": "These results indicate that the endothelin system does not participate to an important degree in the mechanisms leading to elevated blood pressure after chronic NO synthase inhibition with L-NAME in normal rats. In the chronic model of L-NAME-induced hypertension, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system does not unmask an endothelin-dependent vasopressor tone. In addition, either NO does not regulate vascular endothelin-1 gene expression or L-NAME exerts an inhibitory effect on endothelin expression in blood vessels.", 
    "83": "ACE inhibitors potentiate kinin-nitric oxide (NO)-dependent coronary vascular dilation, and NO can modulate myocardial oxygen consumption. Whether ACE inhibitors also affect myocardial O2 consumption has not been established.", 
    "84": "Production of nitrite, a metabolite of NO in aqueous solution, in coronary microvessels and O2 consumption in myocardium were quantified with the use of in vitro tissue preparations, the Greiss reaction, and a Clark-type O2 electrode. In coronary microvessels, kininogen (the precursor of kinin; 10 micrograms/mL) and three ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalaprilat, or ramiprilat; 10(-8) mol/L) increased nitrite production from 76 +/- 6 to 173 +/- 15, 123 +/- 12, 125 +/- 12, and 153 +/- 12 pmol/mg, respectively (all P < .05). In myocardium, kininogen (10 micrograms/mL) and captopril, enalaprilat, or ramiprilat (10(-4) mol/L) reduced cardiac O2 consumption by 41 +/- 2%, 19 +/- 3%, 25 +/- 2%, and 35 +/- 2%, respectively. The changes in both nitrite release and O2 consumption in vitro were blocked by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or N omega-nitro-L-arginine, inhibitors of endogenous NO formation. The effects were also blocked by HOE 140, which blocks the bradykinin B2-kinin receptor, and serine protease inhibitors, which inhibit local kinin formation.", 
    "85": "Our data indicate that stimulation of local kinin formation by use of a precursor for kinin formation or inhibition of kinin degradation by use of ACE inhibitors increases NO formation and is important in the control of cardiac O2 consumption. Vasodilation and control of myocardial O2 consumption by NO may contribute importantly to the therapeutic actions of ACE inhibitors in cardiac disease states.", 
    "86": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) have been very effective in treating hypertension. Adverse conditions in the fetus with the use of ACE-I, such as oligohydramnios, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), hypocalvaria, persistent ductus arteriosus with fetal and neonatal death have been rerported. Though the pathophysiology was thought to be a problem with renal hypoperfusion in the fetus, it remained unclear whether the first trimester exposure to these drugs produced a similar pattern. We participated in a collaborative trial initiated by the Organization of Teratology Information Services (OTIS) in the United States to examine whether first trimester exposure to ACE-I was of concern. Eight women from our High Risk Pregnancy Unit who delivered in our hospital were enrolled in the trial. All were treated with either Enalapril or Captopril in the first trimester due to various reasons, mainly chronic hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. No major malformations were detected in the nine newborns studied (one pair of twins). Two cases of IUGR were diagnosed, one of them ended in an intra-uterine death, but this was attributed to maternal severe disease and probably not to drug effect. We are definitely not suggesting that women should stay on ACE-I until the second trimester, but it seems that renal blood flow and its associated problems with glomerular filtration are not affected in the first trimester.",

    "89": "The 1993 recommendation from the JNC that diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers be preferred for therapy in most patients with hypertension has proved controversial. This recommendation derived primarily from recent long-term studies showing convincing reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality when these agents are used to control hypertension. Comparable data have not yet been obtained for newer agents, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Nonetheless, some critics of the JNC recommendation still favor the newer agents because of their putatively superior side-effect profile, from both a metabolic and a compliance standpoint.",

    "91": "The group of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart disease. However, it has been reported that in some of patients ACE-inhibitors induce hyperreactivity of the airways with occurrence of a persistent dry cough, dyspnoe and wheezing. We supposed that the mechanism of these hyperreactivity is connected to accumulation of bradykinin, tachykinins and other inflammatory mediators in the airways. Increased local concentration of inflammatory neuropeptides stimulates bronchial C fibres and rapidly adapting receptors and provoke the cough reflex. Inflammatory processes in the airways could be followed by contraction of airway smooth muscle. In this study, our aim was to measure the changes of the number and intensity of mechanical induced cough in cats, which were treated for days with enalapril (5 mg/kg b.w.). After 15 days of treatment the reactivity of the lung and tracheal smooth muscles to the bronchoconstrictor mediator histamine was estimated. As to our finding 15 days of administration of enalapril results in significant increase of cough parameters measured with a more significant sensitivity of the laryngopharyngeal part. In the experimental animals we observed increased reactivity of bronchial smooth muscle to histamine after 15 days of enalapril treatment. The reactivity of the lung smooth muscle to the histamine was not significantly changed. These results confirmed the increased cough sensitivity and increased bronchial reactivity after enalapril treatment. These experimental animal model may be useful for the investigation of the pharmacological minimization of respiratory adverse effect of ACE-inhibitors.",

In response AAC, there was a 70-fold increase in the beta-MHC mRNA (P < 0.01), while alpha-MHC mRNA reduced to 26% (P < 0.01). Losartan (3 mg.kg-1.d-1, i.g. for 11 d) to AAC rats caused inhibitions of beta-MHC by 96% and alpha-MHC by 86% gene expression without lowering blood pressure. A reduction in beta-MHC mRNA was also seen in captopril-treated rats (30 mg.kg-1.d-1, i.g. for 11 d), but the inhibitory effect of captopril on alpha-MHC mRNA was less than that of losartan (44% vs 86%, P < 0.05).", 
    "95": "The shift of MHC isoform induced by pressure overload is due to up-regulation of beta-MHC and down-regulation of alpha-MHC gene expression. Inhibition of beta-MHC gene expression by losartan is achieved primarily by direct blockade of angiotensin II type I receptors in the myocardium, independent on hemodynamics.", 
    "96": "Perindopril 4 mg once daily was given to 40 hypertensives for 4 weeks. The results showed that systolic and diastolic blood presure were decreased by 3.2 kPa (22.2 +/- 2.21-19.0 +/- 1.92 kPa) and 1.87 kPa (13.4 +/- 1.21-11.5 +/- 1.27 kPa), respectively. The total effective rate was 80%. Serum Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme activity in 30 patients was significantly decreased from 58.5 +/- 29.5 U to 18.2 +/- 16.2 U (P < 0.01). The urine level of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in 27 patients significantly decreased from a prior level of 13.66 +/- 7.81 U.gCr-1 to 10.12 +/- 5.57 U.gCr-1 (P < 0.01). The side effects of perindopril were cough (7.5%), constipation (10%), dizziness (7.5%), flatulence (7.5%) and diarrhea (5%).

Plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin I (AT I), aldosterone (ALD), endothelin (ET) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Fifty patients with LVDHF were divided into treatment group and control group in a randomized, double blind, control method. Enalpril, CoQ10 and VitE were given in treatment group while only CoQ10 and VitE were given in control group. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment. The results showed that plasma concentration of PRA, AT I, ALD, ET and ANP were increased in LVDHF, but lower than those in LVSHF. After treatment with enalapril plasma PRA was increased while AT I, ALD and ET level were decreased significantly but ANP level had no change in treatment group.", 
    "98": "The protective effect of coronary sinus retroperfusion of Captopril on the ischemic myocardium was observed in dogs with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The results showed that the infarction size and the level of coronary sinus plasma endothelin (ET) and manodialdenyde (MDA) were smaller and lower when Captopril was administered by coronary sinus retroperfusion than that by systemic intravenous injection. These results suggest that (1) Captopril can be distributed adequately in the local ischemic myocardial zones when administered by coronary sinus retroperfusion in the presence of coronary artery occlusion, (2) Captopril can more effectively protect ischemic myocardium by inhibition of the ET release and against the oxygen free radicals in ischemic myocardial area when used by coronary sinus retroperfusion.", 
    "99": "Oscillatory potentials of the electroretinogram are useful to confirm the diagnosis of essential hypertension. Thirty-five hypertensive patients underwent primary antihypertensive therapy with four different treatments. Oscillatory potentials were recorded before the treatment and after 12 months. The oscillatory response increased in a statistically significant manner in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group. This is probably caused by the vasodilatation mechanism, which increases the retinal blood flow.", 
    "100": "The vascular endothelial function is altered in certain vascular pathology such as arterial hypertension. However, the endothelial effect of the pharmacologic treatment of this pathology with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is poorly understood. To evaluate the effects of long-term treatment of captopril on the rat aortic vascular reactivity, 2 groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (n = 6) were studied for 12 weeks: the first group was treated with captopril (CAP) (2 g/l of water) while group 2 (OCAP) received no treatment. A third group without hypertension was considered as control group (CTL). At the end of the experiments, isolated aortic rings were studied in organ chambers for endothelial and smooth muscle vascular reactivity. The endothelial-dependent relaxations (EDR) to cumulative doses of acetylcholine, histamine or adenosine diphosphate were significantly decreased in the aortic segments of CTL compared to CAP (p < 0.05). Aortic segments from OCAP group demonstrated intermediate EDR responses between CAP and CTL groups. Smooth muscle relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was comparable among the 3 groups. Maximal smooth muscle contraction to progressive doses of norepinephrine was significantly higher in the CTL group compared to the hypertensive groups.", 
    "101": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats have an increased basal vascular tone. The increased EDR observed with hypertension partially compensates this hypercontractility. Chronic hypertension treatment with captopril partially normalizes EDR responses in the rat aorta suggesting the lost of the endothelial compensatory mechanism by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "102": "We investigated the effect of captopril on the growth of the left ventricle in an experimental model of aortic insufficiency. Four groups of rabbits were studied 28 days after experimental intervention: 1. control, 2. control with captopril (10 mg/kg/day), 3. aortic insufficiency, 4. aortic insufficiency with captopril (10 mg/kg/day). Aortic insufficiency induced hypertrophic growth of the left ventricle demonstrated by increased weight and ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentration. Administration of captopril only slightly attenuated the weight increase of the left ventricle and the increase in concentration of left ventricular RNA. However, captopril reduced the concentration of left ventricular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) both in the control and even more in the group with aortic insufficiency. The chronic haemodynamic overload enhanced mitochondrial respiration in the left ventricle which was not influenced by captopril. We conclude that captopril in the dose 10 mg/kg/day did not prevent hypertrophy of the left ventricle but reduced left ventricular DNA concentration.",

This drug combination can result in ARF through a fall of glomerular filtration by combined renal blood flow changes: NSAID inhibit vasodilation by renal prostaglandins, and the vasoconstrictor effect on the efferent arteriole is inhibited by the ACEI. Nephrotoxicity during the simultaneous use of ACEI and NSAID is increased by other risk factors of renal insufficiency such as ageing, preexisting renal disease and hypovolaemia. In these cases, a preventive therapy should be considered.", 
    "104": "The sensitivity (EC50) of the ring segment of the mesenteric artery to serotonin (4.84 +/- 0.53 x 10(-7) mol.l-1) was 17x greater than that of the aortic ring segment (5.29 +/- 0.46 x 10(-6) mol.l-1). Incubation of the ring segments in physiological salt solution (PSS) containing methylene blue greatly potentiated the sensitivity of both the aorta and mesenteric artery to serotonin. The degree of potentiation was higher in the aorta than mesenteric artery. L-NAME also increased the sensitivity of both the aorta and mesenteric artery to serotonin and there was no difference in the degree of potentiation of the responses between the aorta and the mesenteric artery. Indomethacin inhibited the contractile responses of the aorta and the mesenteric artery to serotonin. Phenoxybenzamine reduced the contractile responses of both the aorta and the mesenteric artery by the same magnitude. Captopril (10(-4) mol.l-1) significantly attenuated the responses of the mesenteric artery more than the aorta, while methysergide (10(-8) mol.l-1) completely abolished the difference in the responses (EC50 for aorta = 3.50 +/- 0.55 x 10(-5) mol.l-1 vs 5.00 +/- 0.49 x 10(-5) mol.l-1 for mesenteric artery). This study demonstrates that rat aorta and mesenteric artery respond differently to serotonin and the differential response is due to a methylene blue sensitive factor and differences in either the receptor population or sensitivity.", 
    "105": "An increased thickness of the carotid artery wall is thought to be a sign of early atherosclerosis. We have investigated the effects of fosinopril sodium in asymptomatic diabetic hypertensive subjects on the 12-month progression of arterial wall thickness. Forty non-insulin-dependent diabetics with hypertension and without hyperlipidemia were studied. After a 4-week run-in-diet phase, oral fosinopril sodium was administered (20 mg once daily) to 20 patients randomly selected, while 20 subjects were treated only with diet. The two groups were matched for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes and glycemic control. Arterial wall thickness was measured as the mean of the maximum intimal-media thickness (IMT) in 16 carotid segments by B-mode ultrasound. The IMT increase over 12 months was 4.3% in the fosinopril sodium group vs 15.1% in subjects with diet. We conclude that fosinopril sodium treatment may be useful in decreasing the progression rate.", 
    "106": "ACE inhibitors exert both acute and chronic beneficial effects on cardiac function (e.g remodelling, diastolic dysfunction). We have previously reported that the ACE inhibitor captopril induces selective left ventricular (LV) relaxant effects in the isolated ejecting guinea pig heart. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the mechanism of the captopril-induced changes in early LV relaxation by comparing the effects of two sulphydryl and two non-sulphydryl containing ACE inhibitors in the same experimental preparation. Isolated ejecting guinea pig hearts were studied under conditions of constant loading and heart rate. LV pressure was monitored by a 2F micromanometer-tipped catheter transducer inserted in the LV cavity. The sulphydryl-containing ACE inhibitors captopril and zofenaprilat enhanced early LV relaxation, whereas the non-sulphydryl-containing ACE inhibitors lisinopril and quinaprilat did not. The effects of captopril and zofenaprilat were attenuated both by the nitric oxide-scavenger haemoglobin and the bradykinin B2-kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140. Neither the oxygen free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase nor the sulphydryl-containing compound N-acetyl cysteine administered together with lisinopril had any effect on LV relaxation. These data demonstrate that inhibition of intra-cardiac ACE activity may acutely modulate LV relaxation through increased activity of the bradykinin-nitric oxide pathway. The presence of a sulphydryl group on the relevant ACE inhibitor appears to be essential for this LV relaxant effect.", 
    "107": "The negative inotropic effect of nearly all antiarrhythmic drugs, especially important in patients with impaired left ventricular function, represents a major drawback of medical therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the atrial and ventricular function and the exercise capacity in patients with mild heart failure treated with d,l-sotalol after electrical conversion of atrial fibrillation. The study included patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (for more than 2 weeks but less than 1 year) and mild heart failure (< or = class II NYHA). All patients had comparable basal echocardiographic findings, and received captopril. After successful cardioversion the patients were randomized in two groups: group 1 treated with sotalol (mean dose 240 mg q.d., max. 320 mg) and group 2--without sotalol. The drop-out criterion was the failure to maintain sinus rhythm. Finally, in the study remained 17 patients (10 men, 7 women, aged 41-60 years); group 1 included 10 patients and group 2-7 patients. They were assessed by quantitative echocardiography + Doppler and by standard ecg exercise test at less than 1 month but more than 2 weeks, and at 1, 3, and 6 months. When first evaluated (2 weeks-1 month), peak A wave velocity and atrial filling ratio were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (37 +/- 10 cm/s vs 20 +/- 5 cm/s and 23% +/- 7 vs 13% +/- 5, respectively) and group 1 had also a lower exercise tolerance (80 +/- 25 W vs 110 +/- 10 W). There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in left atrial and left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction and E wave deceleration time. After 1 month there were no significant differences in Doppler characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and exercise tolerance between the two groups. Group 1 remained at a lower heart rate and had a lower maximal double product (17250 mmHg/min vs 22100 mmHg/min) corresponding to a lower cardiac work. At 3 and 6 months there were no significant changes in all characteristics between the two groups. In conclusion, sotalol seems to be a well tolerated antiarrhythmic agent in patients with mild heart failure, after conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation. In this setting: 1. Sotalol could reversibly amplify the effect of atrial stunning after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, but this effect is brief. 2. Sotalol has no relevant negative inotropic effect, at least not in association with captopril. 3. Sotalol improves the effort capacity.",

The effects of the inhibitors DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropionic acid (MGTA, for kininase I), phosphoramidon (for endopeptidase 24.11) and captopril and rentiapril (for angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE, kininase II]) suggested the essential roles of the above three proteases in BK degradation: among the three proteases, kininase I and endopeptidase 24.11 appeared to be the most important in kininase action in the placenta microsomes, whereas kininase I and ACE appeared to be the most important in kininase action in the placental cytosol, lysosome and pregnancy serum. Measurements of BK concentrations in the umbilical arterial blood, umbilical venous blood and maternal plasma revealed higher concentrations in the mother than in the fetus. The present data suggest that degradation of BK in the placenta and pregnancy serum might contribute to the gradient of BK between mother and fetus.",

The percentage of patients exhibiting an excellent (trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg) or good (trough SiDBP > 90 mm Hg, with decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg) antihypertensive response to losartan and captopril therapy at Week 12 was comparable (60.0% and 54.7%, respectively). The percentage of patients reporting a clinical adverse experience considered drug-related by the investigator was 13% in the captopril group and 10% in the losartan group.

Efficacy and safety of the treatment were assessed by changes in albuminuria and proteinuria, BP. Reduction of albuminuria occurred in 19(79.1%) out of 24 patients with microalbuminuria, in 13(54.1%) of them urine excretion of albumin returned to normal levels. All the patients with proteinuria and macroalbuminuria benefited from ramipril therapy because their proteinuria diminished or even disappeared (2 cases). The persistence of the antiproteinuria effect on posttreatment week 12 was 66.6%. Ramipril effect on BP was minimal. It is inferred that ramipril is effective in the treatment of DN at the stage of microalbuminuria and proteinuria in patients with normal BP.",

Perindopril was administered in a single daily dose of 2 mg or higher if demanded to reduce symptoms of CHF and/or to normalize BP. The treatment continued for 3 months. The 24-h BP profile was assessed using portable device SpaceLabs 90207 (USA). In CHF patients with hypertension perindopril significantly lowered mean 24-h, day and night BP and its loads, reestablished two-phase circadian rhythm of AP and corrected BP variability. In CHF patients free of hypertension significant changes of the profile were not registered. It is evident that unwanted changes in the BP 24-h profile due to perindopril were absent in CHF normotensives.", 
    "117": "Epidemiological and clinical studies have defined the lower incidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease in women than in age-matched men. After menopause the difference becomes less significant, what is due to estrogen deficiency. The mechanism of vascular protective effect of estrogen involves inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, protection of endothelium function and improvement of lipid metabolism. One of the most important risk factor of atherosclerosis is hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension in elderly women is extremely high-up to 80%. Because of absence of the hormonal replacement therapy effect on blood pressure, there is an indication for antihypertensive therapy in postmenopausal women. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the class of drugs which can lower cardiovascular mortality due to hypertension and atherosclerosis in elderly women. They improve impaired insulin sensitivity and inhibit activation of renin-angiotensin system, both processes leading to the development of hypertension in postmenopausal women. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also possess a direct anti-atherosclerotic properties, like inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, protection of endothelium function, reduced macrophages activation and foam cell accumulation, protection of LDL particles and improvement of fibrinolysis.",

In spite of differences between pathophysiology of hypertension in diabetes type I and type II, the antihypertensive treatment retards or prevents the appearance of overt diabetic nephropathy and reduces cardiac risk in both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. Treatment of hypertension in both type I and type II diabetes comprises nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Converting-enzyme inhibitors and certain calcium antagonists seems to be first line agents to preserve renal function and lower of the cardiac risk in patients with diabetes and hypertension.", 
    "119": "The aim of the study was to evaluate diagnostic validity of captopril test and scintigraphic test before and after captopril for the detection of renovascular hypertension (RVH) according to applied criteria. Employing blood pressure response to captopril as a criteria sensitivity was 37.0%, specificity 92.1%, positive predictive value 75.0% and negative predictive value 70.2% in the captopril test. Applying plasma renin activity (PRA) response to captopril as a criteria sensitivity was 92.5%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 96.0% in the same test. Renin captopril test has excellent sensitivity and positive predictive value, is easy to perform and inexpensive and therefore may be a useful screening test for RVH in unselected population. With the own criteria used, captopril renoscintigraphy detected RVH with 87.5% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity, 87.5% positive predictive value and 91.7% negative predictive value. Captopril renoscintigraphy is an accurate diagnostic test for the identification of RVH in a clinically selected high-risk population. Common evaluation of both tests does not improve their accuracy in diagnosis of RVH.", 
    "120": "In three prospective cohort studies, treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics has been associated with an increased risk of diabetes developing. Prospective, randomized studies with antihypertensive drugs have demonstrated differences between different classes of drugs regarding effects on insulin sensitivity. Thus, treatment with beta-blockers or diuretics is associated with impairment in insulin sensitivity, whereas most modern calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are neutral. However, there are exceptions within the different classes. Captopril seems to differ from the other ACE inhibitors in that the result is an improvement of insulin sensitivity. In the Captopril Primary Preventive Project the effects on cardiovascular disease and diabetes of captopril-based and conventional treatment are compared. This study will hopefully give the answer to the question whether insulin resistance is a valid intermediary endpoint.", 
    "121": "As a consequence of vessel wall injury, subendothelial matrix and collagen fibers are exposed to the flowing blood. Circulating platelets adhere to these structures and initiate arrest of blood flow. Subendothelial von Willebrand Factor (vWF) plays an important role in mediating platelet adhesion to the injured site, at least in the arterial circulation, characterized by sufficiently elevated shear forces to allow a critical conformation change in vWF, enabling an interaction between the vWF domain A1 and the vWF receptor on the platelet, the GPIb/IX complex. In vitro, in the absence of shear forces, non-physiological mediators are required to induce vWF binding to GPIb. Analysis of the mechanism according to which ristocetin induces vWF binding to GPIb revealed that 2 dimers of ristocetin simultaneously bind to vWF and GPIb, thus forming a quaternary complex in which repulsive negative charges are neutralized by the positively charged ristocetin. The interaction of vWF with its vascular receptor, i.e. collagen VI, which was isolated from human placenta and the extracellular matrix from lung fibroblasts, showed that vWF binds to collagen VI entirely via its A1 domain, i.e. via the domain that binds to GPIb. Also, vWF binding to intact extracellular matrices occurs to matrix associated collagen VI via the vWF A1 domain. By using a combination of 2 specific monoclonal anti-vWF antibodies, it was possible to induce conformational changes in WF that exposed the binding sequences in the A1 domain for GPIb. Thus, in the absence of shear forces, specific vWF binding to GPIb could be induced in the absence of any further mediators. This increased vWF binding to GPIb was sufficient to induce vWF dependent platelet aggregation, although as a consequence of Fc binding to the platelet Fc receptor, platelet activation also occurred via this pathway. Thus, general conformational changes in vWF suffice to expose the relevant amino acid sequences in the A1 domain that enable binding to GPIb. The collagen binding protein calin, isolated from the saliva of the medicinal leech, not only blocks platelet binding to collagen but also inhibited vWF binding. Thus this protein was able to inhibit both the vWF independent and vWF dependent platelet adhesion to various collagens, but much less the platelet binding to endothelial extracellular matrices, that contain matrix anchored vWF. In vivo anti-thrombotic studies in the hamster showed that the vWF antagonist aurin tricarboxylc acid was a more potent inhibitor of arterial thrombosis than of venous thrombosis, confirming the in vivo role of vWF during thrombus formation. Following vessel wall damage and thrombus formation, the neointima that formed in the hamster carotid artery developed more rapidly than in other models, and its formation partially responded to reported inhibitors of restenosis. The combination of cardiovascular drugs with complementary modes of action, such as G4120 (inhibitor of platelet GPIIb/IIIa and smooth muscle cell alpha(v) beta(3)) and quinapril (potent vascular ACE inhibitor) prevented neointima formation to about 70%, i.e. better than with any treatment separately.", 
    "122": "In a subgroup of 301 hypertensive patients out of the user--observation study (\"Anwendungsbeobachtung\") with Renitec und CO-Renitec we studied which compliance-improving methods are effective. We tested the effects of blood pressure self-measurement and of an exclusive conversation with the patients. It could be shown, at least in our approach, that the conversation with the patient resulted in a lighter efficacy than blood pressure self-measurement: > 80% compliance was found in 80% of the patients, compared with only 40% of the patients with standard care.", 
    "123": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on renoscintigraphic curves using DTPA as a tracer in patients with essential (EH) and renovascular (RVH) hypertension. Twenty four patients with EH and sixteen with RVH were studied. Protocol consisted of control renoscintigraphy with DTPA and the second one after captopril administration in dose 25 mg performed after three days. Relative DTPA uptake of the single kidney was calculated from the curve time-activity between 120 and 180 second after tracer administration. Results were expressed as a quotient of the relative DTPA uptake of ischemic or \"weaker\" kidney to the DTPA uptake of both kidneys (coefficient A) or contralateral one (coefficient B). Coefficient A in basic renoscintigraphy did not differ in patients with EH and RVH and was 45.81 +/- 3.02% and 44.66 +/- 6.17% respectively. In renoscintigraphy with captopril coefficient A decreased significantly (P < 0.001) in patients with RVH and was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in patients with EH. Change (delta) of coefficient B after captopril was significantly higher in patients with RVH (p < 0.001). Significant correlations were found between delta coefficient A and delta diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial pressure as well as delta plasma renin activity (PRA) after captopril in patients with RVH. Similarly, relationships were shown between percentage change (% delta) of coefficient B and % delta of systolic (SAP), DAP and MAP as well as delta PRA after captopril in patients with RVH.",

The mean AUC0-infinity for temocapril diacid increased only two- to threefold from group A to D. The mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) for temocapril diacid was prolonged in subjects with impaired renal function. However, prolongation of mean t1/2 and increase in AUC0-infinity did not parallel the decrease of mean renal clearance for temocapril diacid.", 
    "127": "The results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway in addition to the renal excretion of temocapril, e.g. via the bile. This pathway substantially contributes to the elimination of the active metabolite, temocapril diacid, in patients with decreased renal function. Nonetheless, to avoid any risks, the dose of temocapril hydrochloride in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment should be reduced.", 
    "128": "The effects on glomerular hemodynamics of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril and of angiotensin II receptor blockade with EXP 3174, an active metabolite of losartan, either alone or in combination, were compared in anesthetized dogs. Administration of EXP 3174 intrarenally led to an increase in renal blood flow by +14% and in glomerular filtration rate by +7%, thus decreasing the filtration fraction by -5%. Similar changes were observed at the single-nephron level. Water, sodium, potassium, and urea excretion rates rose considerably. A decrease in effective filtration pressure by -27% and an increase in ultrafiltration coefficient, Kf, by +57% were seen. A drop in total arteriolar resistance by -19% was mainly due to a decrease in efferent (-25%) rather than afferent (-14%) resistance. When captopril, an ACE inhibitor, was administered intravenously after and during EXP 3174, an additional increase in renal blood flow, by +8%, with no change in glomerular filtration rate was seen which led to an additional decrease in filtration fraction by -5%; additional increases were observed in water and urea but not in sodium and potassium excretion rates. An additional decrease in total arteriolar resistance, by -14%, was now evenly distributed between the efferent (-6%) and afferent (-8%) arterioles. Almost all of these additional changes disappeared when a bradykinin B2-antagonist, Hoe 140, was infused together with captopril. In conclusion, administration of an ACE inhibitor led to a significantly enhanced vasodilatory response in the kidney as compared with the administration of an angiotensin II-receptor blocker. This enhancement was almost eliminated by the coadministration of Hoe 140, thus rendering the participation of kinins fairly plausible.", 
    "129": "Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of chronic renal failure. The evidence available indicates that renal hemodynamics are altered in clinical and experimental diabetes mellitus. In these circumstances, an increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is associated with albuminuria and eventually with glomerulosclerosis. We studied the renal and hemodynamic effects of long-term treatment (5 months) using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril, 0.7 mg/g b.w. per day) and a calcium antagonist (verapamil, 20 mg/g b.w. per day), and the combination of the two (veratran) at the same dose, on streptozotocin-diabetic uninephrectomized rats. A moderate degree of hyperglycemia (2-4 g/l) was maintained with daily insulin. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured monthly using the tail-cuff method. Determinations were made of urinary protein excretion, creatinine clearance, urinary electrolyte excretion and, at the end of treatment, renal and cardiac hypertrophy. MAP was similar in control and untreated diabetic rats. Trandolapril and veratran reduced MAP whereas verapamil alone had no effect on these animals. All groups showed a slight proteinuria that increased with verapamil treatment. The GFR of diabetic animals was higher than in the control group (mainly the first 2 months), except for veratran group, in which it was similar to the control value. Urinary electrolyte excretion increased in all diabetic groups with no significant differences among them. Veratran induced a protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy. None of the treatments affected renal hypertrophy. It is concluded that in a murine model of diabetes without hypertension or proteinuria, a combination of verapamil and trandolapril prevents hyperfiltration whereas verapamil alone increases proteinuria.", 
    "130": "In numerous studies left ventricular hypertrophy has been clearly established to be a strong, blood-pressure independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In fact, increased echocardiographic left ventricular mass has been shown to predict cardiovascular complications not only in patients with hypertension, but also in the general population. Preliminary data revealed that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy indeed reduces cardiovascular complications. As a consequence, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy by drug treatment has emerged as a desirable goal in patients with echocardiographically determined left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings raised the question, whether certain antihypertensive drugs differ in their ability to reduce left ventricular mass. To resolve this issue several comparative studies and some meta-analyses have been carried out. In a meta-analysis by Dahl\u00f6f et al., comprising 109 treatment studies published until december 1990 with a total of 2357 patients, ACE-inhibitors (-15%) were most effective in reducing left ventricular mass followed by diuretics (-11.3%), calcium channel blockers (-8.5%) and beta-blockers (-8%). Reduction in left ventricular mass was mainly due to a decrease in wall thickness except for diuretics which predominantly reduced ventricular diameter. Although reduction in blood pressure was similar for all antihypertensive agents, the correlation between changes in mean arterial pressure and effect on left ventricular mass was only significant for beta-blockers with a modest correlation for ACE-inhibitors and no clearcut relation for diuretics and calcium channel blockers.", 
    "131": "In recent years several meta-analyses have been performed of studies in which the effect of various antihypertensive therapies on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been assessed. It is the purpose of this review to briefly discuss three of these meta-analyses. All data in the reviewed studies have been obtained with the echocardiographic technique.", 
    "132": "In addition to being accepted therapy in hypertension and heart failure, ACE inhibitors may well offer a new dimension in anti-ischaemic therapy. Currently, anti-ischaemic properties have been demonstrated by ACE inhibitors in selected patient groups, including patients with left ventricular dysfunction with or without a direct temporal relationship with myocardial infarction. Anti-ischaemic effects of ACE inhibitors become apparent late after initiation of treatment and suggest a structural rather than a functional effect. Underlying mechanisms may include a reduction in ventricular dilatation and (abnormal) cardiac hypertrophy, leading to less myocardial oxygen demand and, possibly, improved subendocardial blood supply, and vasculoprotective effects, i.e. anti-atherosclerotic and antiremodelling properties, a beneficial effect on the fibrinolytic system and an improvement in abnormal endothelial vasodilator function. The latter aspect is most probably the pivotal mode of action where the anti-ischaemic profile of ACE inhibition is concerned. An improvement in endothelial dysfunction has been shown in patients with mild to moderate coronary artery disease [Trial on Reversing ENdothelial Dysfunction (TREND)]. It is of importance that, in both clinical experiments and human studies, the role of bradykinin appears central in the structural and functional cardiovascular effects of ACE inhibition. This is particularly true for the improvement of impaired endothelial function. Myocardial ischaemia evokes vasoconstrictor neurohormonal activation, which may lead to coronary vasoconstriction in diseased coronary segments. The subsequent abnormal endothelial function leads to diminished coronary flow and also increases systemic vasotone and afterload, thus unfavourably altering the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio. Under laboratory conditions, acute ACE inhibition counteracts this activation in humans. However, it is speculated that this anti-ischaemic mechanism may become operative and clinically important during long term oral ACE inhibitor therapy when endothelial function improves, and may subsequently protect against the vasoconstrictor effect of neurohormonal activation. As it is unlikely that the mechanisms mentioned above are only relevant in patients with ventricular dysfunction or heart failure, several large controlled trials are currently examining the long term anti-ischaemic and cardiovascular protective effects of ACE inhibition in patients at risk of a cardiovascular event [Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study (HOPE)], with a normal cardiac function [Prevention of Events with ACE inhibition study (PEACE)] or in all patients with coronary artery disease irrespective of cardiac function [EUropean trial of Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA)].", 
    "133": "Large randomised clinical trials have shown ACE inhibitors to improve survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The precise mechanism underlying this benefit is not fully established, despite extensive research. There is also controversy with regard to the clinical use of these drugs, particularly the need for selection of patients prior to treatment and the timing of drug initiation and withdrawal for maximum benefit. Animal models of AMI used to assess drug effects are of limited value in understanding the mechanisms of benefit because they involve significantly different pathophysiology from that which occurs in humans. Here we propose that the benefit of ACE inhibitor therapy is largely confined, post-AMI, to those with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction clinically or on investigation, and suggest the continuing importance of treatment distant from the acute event. We argue that the beneficial effects are, at least in part, related to a reduction in the direct toxic effects of angiotensin II and catecholamines on cardiomyocytes resulting from the long term excess stimulation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems in these patients. Importantly, we believe that for some patients after AMI there is little or no benefit to be gained from treatment and that, in fact, careful analysis of the trials suggests that ACE inhibitors may be associated with adverse outcomes in some individuals. Finally, since ACE inhibitors also potentiate bradykinin and other peptides, their beneficial action may not simply be due to reducing the formation of angiotensin II. The proportion of the benefit that may be via bradykinin is difficult to assess, especially in humans. However, the advent of the angiotensin receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity to investigate this important issue.", 
    "134": "The endothelium controls vascular smooth muscle tone by secreting relaxing and contracting factors. There is a constant release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRFs) under basal conditions. In addition, the endothelium can increase the release of EDRFs in response to humoral stimulation by vasoactive substances such as acetylcholine or bradykinin. Under physiological conditions, the most important stimulus to the release of EDRFs is an increase in blood flow leading to increased shear stress on endothelial cells. Recent experimental studies raised the possibility that bradykinin plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone at rest and during flow-stimulated conditions. Bradykinin is a very potent vasodilator that exerts its vasodilatory actions by causing endothelial release of nitric oxide, prostacyclin and/or a hyperpolarising factor [endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF)]. This concept is also supported by recent studies in humans demonstrating that bradykinin contributes to the regulation of coronary vascular tone under resting and flow-stimulated conditions. This mechanism has now been shown to be important in both human peripheral and coronary arteries. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only reduce angiotensin II, but also increase bradykinin levels, since the angiotensin converting enzyme is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. This raises the possibility that beneficial vascular effects of ACE inhibitors may be related to increased availability of bradykinin. Indeed, we have recently shown that ACE inhibition improves flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated vasodilation and that this beneficial effect of ACE inhibition is bradykinin dependent. These findings raise the possibility that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in heart failure and coronary artery disease might be partly due to improved endothelial function.", 
    "135": "Myocardial ischaemia, when severe and sustained for more than 40 minutes, results in irreversible damage, i.e. myocardial infarction. However, with early reperfusion, damage is reversible. Complete recovery of contractile function requires some time, despite fully or almost fully restored blood flow. This phenomenon has been termed myocardial stunning. There is experimental evidence showing that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors limit the development of infarct size, reduce the incidence of ischaemic and reperfusion arrhythmias, and enhance the recovery of contractile function of stunned myocardium. These cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors are mediated by an attenuated degradation of bradykinin.", 
    "136": "Kinins are highly potent vasoactive peptides. They reduce blood pressure by vasodilation and are cardio- and vasoprotective. ACE inhibitors potentiate the actions of endogenous kinins by about 50-fold. Kinins are involved in the blood pressure-lowering effects of ACE inhibitors in all forms of hypertension associated with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, kinins play an important role in the metabolic, and cardio- and vasoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "137": "In healthy coronary arteries, the endothelium plays an important role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle growth and contractility. Furthermore, the endothelium inhibits overt platelet aggregation and prevents the adhesion of white blood cells to, and their infiltration into, the vascular wall. Among the mediators of these functions of endothelial cells, nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role. Moreover, the presence of local kinin-generating enzymatic systems associated with endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle, platelets, neutrophils and monocytes suggests that bradykinin stimulates endothelial cells to release NO locally. The activation of endothelial cells by bradykinin is inhibited by kininase II, best known as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Hence, ACE inhibitors, in addition to reducing the levels of angiotensin II (a potent stimulus to vascular smooth muscle growth and contraction), cause an amplification of the release of NO and other endothelial mediators that is induced by bradykinin. Independent risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia reduce the NO-dependent regulation of vascular smooth muscle contractility and growth in otherwise normal coronary arteries. This endothelial dysfunction probably also affects the inhibitory role of NO with regard to platelet aggregation and monocyte infiltration into the vascular wall. In atherosclerotic vessels, the role of NO is severely reduced. In animal models, as well as in patients with coronary artery disease, endothelial dysfunction is improved by treatment with ACE inhibitors. Although in humans the mechanism of the restoration of endothelial function is not known, in animals endogenous kinins and NO are involved. However, it is clear that this process is multifactorial, and thus probably involves both the prevention of the deleterious actions of angiotensin II and the potentiation of bradykinin.", 
    "138": "The current challenge facing clinicians is to develop pharmacotherapies that move beyond the treatment of symptoms towards a new agenda in cardiovascular therapeutics that includes interventions to actually prevent the development of end-stage coronary heart disease. The development of new strategies to alter the natural history of cardiovascular disease will be fostered by gaining insights into the fundamental pathobiological mechanisms that promote the morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders. An emerging body of evidence indicates that locally generated vasoactive substances such as angiotensin II and nitric oxide are important determinants of the natural history of vascular disease. It is anticipated that ongoing clinical trials will extend the concept that modulating the activity of vasoactive substances generated by the endothelium has important implications for altering the course of coronary heart disease.", 
    "139": "Many primary renal diseases are associated with marked proteinuria resistant to immunosuppressive therapy. Short-term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may decrease proteinuria in these patients, but the long-term effect of these agents on urinary protein excretion is not known. We conducted a double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled study of 1 year duration to evaluate the efficacy of the new ACE inhibitor, perindopril, in reducing proteinuria in patients with nephrotic syndrome due to histologically proven membranous and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Half of the patients treated with perindopril displayed a decrease in urinary protein excretion from 6.1 +/- 1.0 to 1.2 +/- 0.5 g/24 h, and a rise in serum albumin levels. In the placebo group, protein excretion increased modestly and serum albumin level did not change. There was no difference between the responders and nonresponders to perindopril in age, blood pressure, level of creatinine clearance or urinary sodium excretion. However, the degree of proteinuria before treatment with perindopril was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the nonresponders. In 3 patients in whom the treatment with perindopril was extended for 18-24 months, urinary protein excretion remained below 1 g/24 h. The data show that perindopril: (1) is an effective agent in the treatment of proteinuria of primary renal diseases; (2) the effect is sustained for up to 2 years if the administration of the drugs is maintained, and (3) this action of perindopril does not depend on the level of sodium intake.",

They had CHF class II-III and ejection fraction (EF) < 45%. Perindopril was given in a single daily dose 2-4 mg for 6 months. The treatment resulted in a significant lowering of CHF class (from 2.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 (p < 0.01). Exercise tolerance increased from 256.2 +/- 18.6 s to 349.8 +/- 27.0 s (p < 0.05). Pump and contractile functions of the myocardium improved: stroke volume increased by 12.7%, ejection fraction by 20.5%, total peripheral vascular resistance fell by 9.7%, circulating blood volume by 9.2%. Parameters of oxygen transport to tissues and tissue respiration also changed for the better. The authors state high efficacy of perindopril in CHF patients.", 
    "141": "Left ventricular hypertrophy associated with systemic hypertension differs from left ventricular hypertrophy initiated by other pressure overload diseases. Its development depends not only of hemodynamics aspects but of biochemical factors. Many studies have demonstrated a close link between left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. For that reason the idea of reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy has been a goal of the antihypertensive treatment. From the literature review has been established that the most classes of antihypertensive medications reduce the left ventricular mass, though there is a variation in required duration of treatment. At this point the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, probably because a double effect: hypotensive and blockers of the trophic stimulus of angiotensin II, seemed to be the most potent for reducing the left ventricular mass. Still we don't know if reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, by the antihypertensive treatment, reduce independently the cardiovascular risk.", 
    "142": "The left ventricular hypertrophy is a deleterious consequence of the arterial hypertension, recognized as independent risk factor. The left ventricular hypertrophy has a myocytic component, of hemodynamic origin, where all the antihypertensive treatments known would be active, in greater or smaller degree, and it's been demonstrated the benefit of the intervention in the sense of the fact that exist improvement indications of the morbi-mortality (cardio-protection). The left ventricular hypertrophy has at the same time a fibrotic component, of neuro-hormonal origin that can be reversed (cardio-reparation) fundamentally by influence of the ACEIs, that would improve furthermore all the components of the called \"hypertensive syndrome\".",

    "144": "Insulin resistance (IR) and secondary hyperinsulinaemia are major risk factors of atherosclerosis and probably also of related glomerulosclerosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), while improving IR in essential hypertension, do not improve it in patients with chronic renal disease. Thus, the combination of ACEI and low protein diet was evaluated. Thirty-eight patients with various kidney diseases and mild to moderate impairment of kidney function were included in the study. Thirteen of them suffered from IR. Their dietary protein intake was decreased from > or = 1.0 g/kg/d to 0.6-0.7 g/kg/d. Moreover, they were treated by ACEI enalapril at dosages of 2-10 mg/d depending on the absence/presence and severity of hypertension. The patients were followed for 8 months. No clinically relevant kidney disease progression (KDP) was found. IR patients improved remarkably. IR was examined by the oral glucose tolerance test and glucose, insulin and C-peptide determinations. Their increased plasma triglyceride, VLDL concentrations and proteinuria decreased, HDL concentration increased. Acid-base balance and anaemia did not change. It is concluded that protein restriction in combination with ACEI treatment improve IR and the associated dyslipoproteinaemia and proteinuria.", 
    "145": "The effect of Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on their own and in combination with the peptide AcSDKP on the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells has been investigated. Hematopoietic stem cells from murine bone marrow induced into cell cycle following exposure to 2 Gy gamma-irradiation were incubated in vitro for up to 24 h in the presence of medium, captopril/lisinopril, AcSDKP, and AcSDKP with either ACE inhibitor. Hematopoietic stem cells were monitored using the high proliferative potential-colony forming cell-1 (HPP-CFC-1) population cloned in the presence of human IL-1 beta, murine IL-3, and murine M-CSF. No significant inhibitory effect was observed in the presence of AcSDKP on its own and AcSDKP in combination with lisinopril. However, there was a significant inhibition of stem cell cycling when AcSDKP and captopril were combined. This suggests that captopril inhibits AcSDKP breakdown better than lisinopril. The combination of AcSDKP and captopril also had an inhibitory effect on cell recruitment into S phase. The fact that a combination of AcSDKP and captopril switches cycling hematopoietic stem cells out of cycle indicates the importance of the N-active catalytic site of ACE in AcSDKP hydrolysis in vitro. Thus, AcSDKP in combination with appropriate ACE inhibitors may be of use in regulating the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro.", 
    "146": "The combination of diabetes and hypertension increases the changes of progressive renal disorder and ultimately renal failure. Roughly 40% of all diabetics, whether insulin dependent or not, develop diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease in the western world and accounts for more than a quarter of all end-stage renal diseases. It is also a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Increased arterial blood pressure is an early and common phenomenon in incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy. The relationship between arterial blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy is a complex one, diabetic nephropathy increasing blood pressure and blood pressure accelerating the course of nephropathy. Calcium antagonists antagonize preglomerular vasoconstriction. Furthermore, additional putative mechanisms include the ability to retard renal growth and possibly to attenuate mesangial entrapment of macromolecules and to attenuate the mitogenic effects of diverse growth factors. Calcium antagonists (except the old short-acting dihydropyridine drugs) reduce microalbuminuria and preserve kidney function in diabetic patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy. Long-term trials using the new long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists for the treatment of patients with incipient nephropathy are still lacking. A recent 1-year randomized double-blind study in hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy showed a more beneficial effect on the decline rate in the glomerular filtration rate of nisoldipine (long-acting dihydropyridine) than angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition. The mean arterial blood pressure during the study based on 24-hour recordings was nearly identical, 103 (SD 9) and 101 (SD 11) mm Hg in the two groups. Furthermore, a recent 5-year randomized open study in hypertensive noninsulin-dependent patients with diabetic nephropathy has revealed the same beneficial effect of a calcium antagonist and ACE inhibition on the progression of nephropathy. In a third group treated with sympatholytic drugs, more than 50% of the subjects had a doubling of their creatinine as compared to less than 10% in the two other groups mentioned above. However, long-term studies are needed to consolidate these findings and expand them to insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease.",

    "149": "Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril controlled ambulatory blood pressure during the day and at peak effect. Nifedipine GITS controlled ambulatory blood pressure during the early morning surge and at night time as well. Nifedipine GITS increased plasma renin activity and noradrenaline by 50 and 20%, respectively, compared to the 150 and 0% change produced by enalapril. Both nifedipine GITS and enalapril reduced proteinuria by 37%. Patients had increasing levels or proteinuria proportional to higher ambient sodium intake (r = 0.48; p < 0.01). This effect was accentuated during nifedipine GITS therapy as compared to enalapril.", 
    "150": "Nifedipine GITS was superior to enalapril in controlling ambulatory blood pressure, but they were equivalent in reducing proteinuria (37%). They had disparate effects on neural activation and the duration of action. Raised protein excretion appears to be associated with raised sodium intake. This was apparent especially during nifedipine XL therapy.", 
    "151": "An increasing body of evidence indicates that the endothelium is crucially involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow and cardiac function. Injury to the endothelium precipitates atherosclerosis by leading to smooth-muscle-cell migration and proliferation, induction of expression of growth factors and impairment in the plasmatic coagulation and endogenous fibrinolysis system. Strategically located between the circulating blood and the vascular smooth muscle, endothelial cells release numerous vasoactive substances regulating the function of vascular smooth muscle and trafficking blood cells. Important endothelium-derived vasodilators are prostacyclin, bradykinin, nitric oxide and, independent of the former, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. In particular, nitric oxide inhibits cellular growth and migration. In concert with prostacyclin, nitric oxide exerts potent antiatherogenic and thromboresistant properties by preventing platelet aggregation and cell adhesion. These effects are counterbalanced by endothelial vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1, both of which exert prothrombotic and growth-promoting properties. Modern therapeutic strategies in coronary artery disease focus on preserving or restoring endothelial integrity. Whereas nitrates partly substitute deficient endogenous nitric oxide, calcium antagonists counteract angiotensin II and endothelin-1 at the level of vascular smooth muscle by reducing Ca2+ inflow and facilitating the vasodilator effects of nitric oxide. Beyond inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors diminish the inactivation of bradykinin, thus leading to an augmentation of nitric oxide release. Furthermore, newly developed specific endothelin antagonists will provide us with greater insight into the beneficial effects of restoring endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disease. Thus, drugs can directly affect endothelial function, prevent the action of endothelial mediators, substitute for deficient endothelial factors or indirectly exert protective effects by interfering with cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "152": "The role of angiotensin II, a potent postglomerular vasoconstrictor, in the hypoxemia-induced renal changes is still controversial. The ability of perindoprilat, an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor, to prevent the acute renal effects of hypoxemia was assessed in 22 anesthetized-ventilated rabbits. In 8 untreated rabbits, hypoxemia induced a significant drop in mean blood pressure (MBP) (-12 +/- 2%), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (-16 +/- 3%) and renal blood flow (RBF) (-12 +/- 3%) with a concomittant increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) (+18 +/- 5%) and urine flow rate (+33 +/- 14%), and without any changes in filtration fraction (FF) (-4 +/- 2%). This suggests the occurrence of glomerular vasoconstriction during the hypoxemic stress. In 7 normoxemic rabbits, intravenous perindoprilat (20 microg/kg) induced an increase in urine flow rate (+17 +/- 4%) and RBF (+17 +/- 4%), and a decrease in MBP (-6 +/- 1%), RVR (-14 +/- 3%) and FF (-11 +/- 2%) without a significant change in GFR. The drop in FF and the increase in RBF suggests preferential postglomerular vasodilatation. In 7 rabbits, perindoprilat prevented the occurence of the hypoxemia-induced changes in RBF and RVR without improving MBP. FF decreased significantly (-18 +/- 2%), while the drop in GFR (-7 +/- 2%) was partially blunted and the increase in urine flow rate (+25 +/- 9%) was confirmed. These results could be explained by the inhibition of the angiotensin-mediated efferent vasoconstriction and by the inhibition of bradykinin degradation by perindoprilat. These data confirm the ability of converting-enzyme inhibitors to prevent the renal hypoperfusion induced by acute hypoxemia.", 
    "153": "Increased myocardial mass (cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH]) is an example of the widespread structural cardiovascular changes, often referred to as remodeling, that may be present in association with sustained high blood pressure. LVH strongly predicts myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients with hypertension. As a result, prevention or reversal of hypertensive LVH is widely accepted as a desirable therapeutic goal. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for remodeling are unclear, it is believed that mechanical, endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine factors control the remodeling process. Certain antihypertensive drugs may have particularly favorable long-term effects in that they prevent and correct these structural changes in addition to reducing arterial pressure. However, the mechanism by which they achieve these effects is not well understood. It is theorized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do so by preventing the generation of growth-promoting/mitogenic peptides and that beta-blockers interfere with the growth-promoting effects of catecholamines. In experimental models, the selective blockade of T-type calcium-ion (Ca2+) channels with mibefradil has been demonstrated to have antiproliferative effects in both the renal and cardiac vasculature; in patients with LVH, mibefradil reduced the left ventricular mass index. Therefore, blockade of T-type Ca2+ channels may be useful in the prevention or regression of cardiovascular remodeling. However, further research will be required before the clinical implications of these findings can be assessed.",

    "155": "Angiotensin convertase inhibitor (Enalapril) was used in 51 children aged 4 days up to 18 years (mean 4.3 +/- 5.5, years). As many as 27 subjects were newborns (4) and infants (23). The patients suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congestive cardiomyopathy (13 cases). 6 treated subjects suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congenital heart malformations before cardiac surgery and 22 after it (including complex malformations operated according to Fontan method). 10 children were treated because of arterial hypertension. 4 subjects suffered form life-threatening arrhythmias coexisting with circulatory insufficiency. (These subjects were already mentioned among the patients suffering from circulatory insufficiency). Enalapril (mainly as a drug named Benalapril) was used in the mean dose of 0.21 mg/kg of body mass daily. 4 patients (8%) died during treatment but their deaths can not be related to angiotensin convertase inhibitor therapy. In the other children (82%) the beneficial influence of angiotensin convertase inhibitor use was found (improvement in comparison with the state before convertase inhibitor introduction). In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect. According to authors' opinion enalapril use is exceptionally profitable in the subjects surgically treated for complex heart malformations (Fontan operation). The beneficial effect was also found in majority of children suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy. Convertase inhibitor was always successfully used as the unique antihypertensive drug in children suffering from arterial hypertension. In the other cases treatment was combined (mainly with digitalis). This combination seems to be exceptionally useful in children suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy. Only in 1 case unserious side effect was found (persistent cough).", 
    "156": "The authors made an open-comparative trial of fosinopril (Fosinorm) efficacy and tolerability in 20 patients (9 males and 11 females) with stage II mild and moderate essential hypertension accompanied with disturbed glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. Fosinorm was given in a dose 10 - 20 mg/day under 24-h monitoring of blood pressure. Diastolic pressure returned to normal in 19 (95%) patients, one patient showed a good hypotensive response. The mean 24-h fall in the systolic and diastolic pressure was significant and made up for systolic pressure 7.5% (9.2% and 9.2%), respectively. Fosinorm had a minimal effect on carbohydrate metabolism, total cholesterol, serum triglycerides. The conclusion is made that Fosinorm is a highly effective antihypertensive drug positively influencing 24-h profile of blood pressure in the absence of negative action on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",

Forty patients with RVH and sixty four with EH were studied. All patients underwent renal digital subtraction angiography in order to find out renal artery stenosis. Blood pressure was measured before and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after captopril administration in the captopril test. PRA was determined before and 60 minutes after captopril. It was shown that fall of systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial pressure after captopril was significant in each time period both in EH and RVH. Hypotensive effect was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in RVH. Basic PRA did not differ in the studied groups. 60 minutes after captopril administration PRA was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with RVH. Absolute and percentage rise of PRA also differentiated studied groups (p < 0.001). Significant correlations were found between the change of PRA after captopril and fall of SAP, DAP and MAP in both groups. These relationships were stronger in RVH.", 
    "158": "Two substrains of the fawn-hooded (FH) rat have been developed, one of which develops progressive hypertension and proteinuria, the FHH, and one which shows little increase in blood pressure and no renal damage, the FHL. Other hypertensive rodent models show primary metabolic disturbances before the development of renal damage, notably hypertriglyceridemia, which may also contribute to progression of renal disease. In this study we evaluated whether hyperlipidemia is a primary disturbance in FHH, or only occurs secondary to proteinuria. Lipid levels were determined before and after development of proteinuria, and compared to those found in age-matched FHL. We also determined whether reducing proteinuria with lisinopril would normalize lipid levels in aging FHH. At 4 weeks of age, proteinuria was very low (2-3 mg/day) in both FHH and FHL. While proteinuria increased steadily in aging FHH, reaching 350 +/- 62 mg/day at 40 weeks, much less increase was observed in FHL over the same period (32 +/- 5 mg/day at 40 weeks). Blood pressure was markedly higher in adult FHH than in FHL (158 +/- 2 vs. 129 +/- 2 mm Hg, p < 0.01). In 4-week-old FHL and FHH, plasma cholesterol levels were similar. Subsequently, cholesterol increased in FHH, reaching 3.4 +/- 0.9 mmol/l at 40 weeks, whereas cholesterol was barely affected by aging in FHL (2.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l at 40 weeks). At 4 weeks, triglyceride levels were lowest in FHH. Subsequently, triglycerides increased in FHH, reaching 3.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/l at 40 weeks, as compared to 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/l in FHL. Besides a transient increase in triglyerides in lisinopril-treated FHH at 11 weeks, increments in blood pressure, proteinuria, cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins A-I, B and E aging FHH were effectively prevented by lisinopril. These data strongly suggest that there is no primary difference in lipid metabolism between FHH and FHL and that changes in plasma lipids in FHH as compared to FHL are all secondary to proteinuria.", 
    "159": "In an attempt to assess the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on anemia and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in peritoneal dialysis patients, we evaluated 5 patients treated with ACEIs for one year, and the results were compared with data from a control group (N = 5). In response to ACEIs, the mean hemoglobin value decreased progressively, reaching statistical significance after 6 months and thereafter (basal, 10.7 +/- 0.8; month 6, 10.3 +/- 0.9; month 12, 10.3 +/- 0.5 g/dL, p < 0.05), with no variations in the control group. The rHuEPO requirements experienced a progressive increase in ACEI-treated patients, from 4400 +/- 1516 U/week at basal to 8600 +/- 2880 U/week at the conclusion of the study (p < 0.01). Serum erythropoietin concentration remained stable during the study in both groups of patients. In conclusion, rHuEPO requirements necessary to maintain a stable hemoglobin concentration are greater in subjects under ACEI therapy. ACEI may be an important cause of resistance to rHuEPO, an effect not mediated by a decrease in endogenous erythropoietin.", 
    "160": "Nitric oxide (NO) has been described as a mediator of smooth muscle relaxation in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. The enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the formation of NO. We examined the expression of the neuronal NOS gene at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level in pyloric smooth-muscle biopsy specimens from six patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. For controls, smooth-muscle layer specimens of pylorus (n=3), ileum (n=2), and colon (n=2) were used. With 31 cycles of PCR reaction, control specimens revealed detectable signals for neuronal NOS mRNA. In contrast, signals of IHPS specimens were undetectable in five cases and very weak in one. By increasing the PCR to 37 cycles, detectable signals for neuronal NOS mRNA were observed in all IHPS specimens, but they were significantly weaker than those of controls. Since a low level of neuronal NOS mRNA may lead to impaired production of NO, our observations indicate that the excessively contracted, hypertrophied pyloric muscle in IHPS is a result of reduced expression of the neuronal NOS gene at the mRNA level.", 
    "161": "Therapy with human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) has been accepted as effective for renal anemia in dialysis patients. However, studies in rats have shown that correcting anemia with EPO may affect the progression of renal dysfunction. In humans, however, the effect of EPO on residual renal function is a matter of controversy. We, therefore, investigated whether the long-term administration of EPO to predialysis patients influences residual renal function. Anemic patients at the predialysis stage with a serum creatinine (Cr) concentration ranging from 2 to 4 (average 2.9) mg/dl and a hematocrit (Ht) of less than 30% were randomly assigned to two groups which consisted of anemic patients not treated with EPO (group I, untreated anemic controls, n = 31) and anemic patients treated with EPO (group II, treated anemics, n = 42). Patients with nonsevere or moderate anemia (Ht > 30%) with a Cr ranging from 2 to 4 (average 2.6) mg/dl were also recruited as nonanemic controls (group III, untreated nonanemic controls, n = 35). Blood pressure was controlled to the same degree among the three groups by combined treatment with calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. All patients were kept strictly on a low-protein (0.6 g/kg/day) and a low-salt (7 g/day) diet. The degree of control of dietary protein and blood pressure and the frequency of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration were comparable among the three groups. The primary end point for each patient was a doubling of the baseline Cr which yielded cumulative renal survival rates which were plotted against time. Ht rose significantly from 27.0+/-2.3 to 32.1+/-3.2% in group II (n = 42, p < 0.001) with a rate of increase of 0.4+/-0.06%/week. However, it declined from 27.9+/-1.8 to 25.3+/-1.9% in group I (n = 31, p < 0.001) and from 35.9+/-3.5 to 32.2+/-3.9% in group III (n = 35, p < 0.001). Cr doubled in 26 patients (84%) in group I as compared with 22 (52%) in group II and 21 (60%) in group III. The cumulative renal survival rates in groups II and III were significantly better than that in group I: p = 0.0003 (group I vs. group II) and p = 0.0024 (group I vs. group III). However, there was no difference in the renal survival rate between groups II and III (p = 0.3111). The better survival rate obtained in group II was attributable to the better survival rate for the nondiabetic patients in this group. The present study suggests that anemia, per se, is a factor in the progression of end-stage renal failure and that reversal of anemia by EPO can retard the progression of renal failure, especially in nondiabetic patients, provided that blood pressure control, rate of increase in Ht, and dietary protein restriction are appropriate.", 
    "162": "The influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) maintenance doses in hemodialysis patients was studied. One hundred and eight chronic hemodialysis patients (55 males and 53 females, mean age 61.2+/-12.6 years) were investigated. The rhEPO maintenance doses in the ACEI-treated group (n = 49) were 101.7+/-51.7 U/kg/week and in the nontreated group (n = 59) 79.2+/-37.8 U/kg/week (p < 0.05). No difference was observed in hematocrit between the ACEI-treated and nontreated groups. In stepwise regression analysis, the parameters associated with increased rhEPO maintenance doses were female gender, ACEI administration, low total iron binding capacity, and low serum free carnitine levels. In conclusion, ACEI administration might reduce the response to rhEPO. In hemodialysis patients who need high-dose rhEPO to maintain the target hematocrit in the absence of iron deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, infection, malignancy, malnutrition, and aluminum toxicity, ACEI administration should be considered.",

    "167": "Since the results of studies done with angiotensin-converting-enzyme(ACE)-inhibitors, systemic thrombolysis and primary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) have been published, post-myocardial infarction therapy has changed dramatically. In most european countries systemic thrombolysis as early as possible is the standard therapy. Cardiologists prefer more and more immediate revascularisation if the technical standard of the hospital is allowing an acute intervention. Pharmacological therapy is done initially with beta-blockers and platelet aggregation inhibitors, if necessary intravenously, since the results of the e.g. GUSTO- and the AIRE-study are known. If left ventricular dysfunction exists or develops, ACE-inhibitors are given after the third day post myocardial infarction.",

Using an open non controlled design; they were treated with placebo for two weeks and with the active drug during eight weeks, in initial doses of 2.5 mg/day that were adjusted to 5 mg/day if diastolic blood pressure did not drop below 90 mm Hg or if its reduction was less than 10 mm Hg.",

Diastolic blood pressure dropped from 102.3 +/- 3.1 to 87.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg. Seventy percent of patients achieved a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg, 56.9% with 2.5 mg/day and 13.8% with 5 mg/day. Dizziness, cough and headache were the main adverse reactions, observed in 3.7, 3.2 and 2.1% of patients respectively. Adherence to treatment was 98%.

    "173": "In 826 hypertensive patients including 396 with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus safety and efficacy of captopril 50 mg per day was evaluated throughout three months. In all patients blood pressure was significantly reduced. Moreover, in part of the patients with microalbuminuria, these tests turned negative with treatment. In addition, in patients with diabetes fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels as well as HBA1C levels decreased. Only in 6.8% side effects occurred. In all patients quality of life as evaluated by a 10 item rating scale questionnaire improved. Taken together the results of this observational study confirm improvement of blood pressure levels, kidney function and metabolic derangements in diabetic patients treated with the ACE-inhibitor captopril. Effectiveness of these actions of captopril in respect to longterm prognosis in diabetics, however, remains to be established.", 
    "174": "This study aimed to compare the efficacy, tolerability and first-dose blood-pressure response of once-daily quinapril and twice-daily captopril when added to diuretic therapy in elderly patients with heart failure. The study was performed at a single centre as an open randomised parallel-group study, patients being selected for inclusion from the outpatient population. Following a starting dose of either 2.5 mg once-daily quinapril, or 6.25 mg twice-daily captopril, patients were reviewed at two-weekly intervals, and following clinical assessment a decision was made either to titrate up to the next medication stage or to enter the patient into the 16-week maintenance phase. Efficacy was assessed using a six-minute walking test, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, a functional lifescale (FLS) questionnaire and the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)-at study entry and at the end of the maintenance phase. Blood pressure was measured for 5 h post-first-dose of medication. Sixty-one patients were randomised to treatment: 30 to quinapril and 31 to captopril. Following withdrawals, data from 36 patients (20 on quinapril, 16 on captopril) were available for analysis. The distance walked during the six-minute walking test improved in both groups; the difference between the treatment groups was not statistically significant. There were no significant changes in the FLS or CTR. An analysis of change in the NYHA status from study entry to study end showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.02) in favour of quinapril. Five patients in each group experienced hypotension during the 5 h following the first dose of medication. This study has shown heart failure to be as well controlled by once-daily quinapril as by twice-daily captopril, with comparable effects on first-dose blood-pressure response.", 
    "175": "Peripheral administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, and the central infusion of sarile, an angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist, were used to evaluate the role of renal and brain generated Ang II in sodium depletion-induced production of Fos in cells of the subfornical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT). Pretreatment with intravenous captopril (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the c-fos expression induced by sodium depletion in the SFO and OVLT. In contrast, continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of sarile (22.5 micrograms/4.5 h, 5 microliters/h) did not affect the expected pattern of c-fos expression observed in both nuclei, 4 h after peritoneal dialysis. These results show that systemic interference with the angiotensin system of renal origin by captopril inhibited the production of Fos induced by sodium depletion in cells of the SFO and OVLT. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a rise in peripheral Ang II levels, triggered by sodium deficiency, could be an important mediator of the physiological and behavioral responses that lead to the restoration of sodium balance. In addition, this study suggests that increased circulating Ang II levels in response to body sodium deficit can directly stimulate neural pathways in the SFO and OVLT.",

A randomized study, using the same experimental design, was conducted specifically to look for GI protection. Animals were randomized into captopril or non-drug arms and irradiated in a 6-fraction total body irradiation regimen, followed by bone marrow transplantation. Rats received captopril in the drinking water at 500 mg/l (70 mg/kg/day), starting 9 days prior to irradiation and continuing throughout the experiment. The 50% lethal dose at 6 days was 20.8 (20.4-21.7) Gy in the non-drug arm and 20.6 (20.3-20.9) Gy in the captopril arm, for a DMF of 0.99 (0.94-1.04). If the randomized and historical studies are combined the DMF is 1.00 (0.93-1.05). We are unable to find any evidence that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril provides protection from acute GI injury in this model. Clearly, it should not be assumed that captopril will modulate radiation reactions in all tissues.",

Kidney artery stenosis, hypovolemia, and shock are only ones contraindications to this treatment in a childhood, even in the first period after birth. Anyhow, it was stressed on the basis of literature that at a beginning of extrauterine life the kinetics of these drugs is changed, thus they should be recommended carefully and in low doses. It was stressed, as well, that up to now appeared only a few papers concerning ACE-inhibitors use a childhood. It is suggested that enalapril can be used as an rather safety drug in pediatric patients suffering from circulatory insufficiency or arterial hypertension.",

It arises because of underdevelopment of tissues of mesodermal and ectodermal origin and is characterized by hypoplasia or absence of patella, ulnar dysplasia, nail plate dystrophy, growths on the iliac bones, renal affection. The disease was detected in early childhood. Renal affection presented with urinary syndrome with a concurrent nephrotic syndrome later on followed by moderate arterial hypertension and progression to renal failure. Renal biopsy revealed the picture of focal segmentary glomerular hyalinosis typical for this disorder. Because immunodepressants were thought inadequate, the treatment included lovastatin and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme to inhibit non-immune mechanisms of the disease progression.",

The design was a 6-8 week titration phase and 6-month maintenance phase. Mean myocardial mass calculated by M-mode echocardiography in the captopril group was 153 +/- 26 g/m2 before, and 130 +/- 14 g/m2 after 6 months of treatment, in enalapril group 147 +/- 22 g/m2 before, and 126 +/- 23 g/m2 after 6 months of treatment (p < 0.05). LV ejection fraction, early and late transmitral flow velocities and early to late LV inflow velocities ratio were not significantly affected by both ACE inhibitors.",

Protein AL, (deriving from immunoglobulin light chain), protein AA and prealbumin are the most involved in this disease. When AL amyloidosis involves the heart, the illness is often terminal. Most clinical symptoms are heart failure and arrhythmia or block conduction. This case was characterised by the unusual combination of hypertension and amyloidosis. The diagnosis suggested by the echocardiographic but was confirmed by the damaged organ's biopsy. The present case concerns a young woman, who has hypertension and a pulmonary oedema. The echocardiographic scan showed a septal hypertrophy with a shining and granite-like aspect which is compatible with heart amyloidosis. Systolic and diastolic disorder with mitral and aortic regurgitation were also revealed. The kidney and rectum biopsies confirmed amyloidosis AL of the Kappa dysglobulinemia type, without extraosseous plasmocytoma. The heart and kidney failure symptoms disappeared after treatment with diuretics and ACE inhibitors.",

It describes their hypotensive properties and therapeutic efficacy. The review discusses also using of ACE inhibitors for disorders often coexisting with hypertension, likewise it presents ACE inhibitors in combination with other hypotensive drugs. The paper discusses also side effects of ACE inhibitors as well as diseases, in which ACE inhibitors are contraindicated.", 
    "182": "The quality of life (QL) in 90 male patients (age 41.2 +/- 41) suffering from Ist IInd hemodynamic WHO-stage of essential arterial hypertension has been studied during 3 months therapy. The patients have been divided into 3 groups treated with enalapril, atenolol and verapamil respectively. The Sickness Impact Profile, Bulpitt's test and Spitzer's test were used for evaluation of QL. Significant reduction in diastolic arterial blood pressure has been achieved during the treatment period. In the same time improvement in QL indices was observed, most evident in group of enalapril, moderate in group of verapamil and the minor in atenolol group. It is concluded that these three QL test (SIP, Bulpit, Spitzer) are very useful in monitoring of treatment of the essential arterial hypertension.", 
    "183": "Captopril ([2S]-1-[3-mercapto-2-methyl-propionyl]-L-proline) was found to protect erythrocytes from hemolysis caused by 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) (AAPH) and hypochlorite, erythrocyte membranes from lipid peroxidation caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) and hypochlorite, erythrocyte membrane ATPases from inactivation caused by tBOOH and hemoglobin from oxidation caused by AAPH and tBOOH. In all these systems enalapril ([S]-1-[N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl]-L-proline) was not protective or even increased the damage, especially with hypochlorite, probably due to chloramine formation. Captopril but not enalapril inhibited ascorbate autoxidation caused by Cu2+, which indicates that captopril binds Cu2+. On the other hand, deoxyribose degradation caused by iron and copper ions and DNA damage by o-phenanthroline/Cu2+/H2O2/beta-mercaptoethanol was enhanced by both captopril and enalapril. The effect of captopril was usually higher, apparently due to the reducing properties of captopril, which could reduce metal ions enabling their participation in the Fenton reaction. These results indicate that only -SH-group-containing inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) may exhibit antioxidant properties, and that the antioxidant/prooxidant action of ACE inhibitors depends on the system studied in vitro.",

The coexistence of diabetes and hypertension confers a high risk of morbidity to this population. Antihypertensive therapy offers an important opportunity to attenuate the rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion in both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. Certain calcium antagonists and converting-enzyme inhibitors are emerging as first-line agents to preserve renal function.", 
    "185": "Left ventricular (LV) cavity dilation (remodeling) following myocardial infarction (MI) is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. This study was undertaken to determine whether nipradilol, a new beta-adrenergic blocker with vasodilating action, reduces LV remodeling after MI produced by coronary ligation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effects on LV remodeling of the following drugs, which were administered orally for 4 weeks, were evaluated by assessing LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI): (1) vehicle, (2) nipradilol, 10 mg/kg per day. (3) propranolol, 50 mg/kg per day, and (4) captopril, 30 mg/kg per day. Since LVEDVI depends on infarct size, the effects of the drugs on LVEDVI were compared between rats with a similar infarct size, i.e., moderate, 20%-40%; and large, 40%-60%, on the basis of the histological determination of infarct size. The nipradilol-treated and captopril-treated rats had significantly smaller LVEDVI than did the vehicle-treated rats with both moderate and large infarction (large infarct: 2.48 +/- 0.12 ml/kg for the vehicle group, 1.69 +/- 0.10 ml/kg for the nipradilol group, P < 0.01, and 1.79 +/- 0.14 ml/kg for the captopril group, P < 0.01). In contrast, LVEDVI-in the propranolol-treated rats was significantly greater than that in the vehicle-treated rats with a moderate infarct (2.09 +/- 0.09 ml/kg for the vehicle group versus 2.44 +/- 0.10 ml/kg for the propranolol group, P < 0.05). The results indicate that nipradilol and captopril reduce LV remodeling after MI, whereas propranolol promotes it.", 
    "186": "In several studies organ protective effects of ACE inhibitors independent from their antihypertensive action have been demonstrated. The mechanisms of the protective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on vasculature and kidney are largely unknown. In the present study the modulatory action of captopril on the angiotensin II (AngII), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced increase of cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was investigated in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and cultured glomerular mesangial cells (MC) from rats using the fluorescent dye technique. Resting [Ca2+]i in VSMC or MC was not significantly affected by captopril. The preincubation of VSMC with 1 mumol/l captopril significantly reduced the AngII-induced [Ca2+]i increase in VSMC from 90 +/- 10 nmol/l (n = 78; mean +/- SEM) to 51 +/- 16 nmol/l (n = 53; p < 0.05) and in MC from 102 +/- 42 nmol/l (n = 14) to 43 +/- 12 nmol/l (n = 7; p < 0.05). In the absence of extracellular calcium captopril produced no effect on AngII induced changes of [Ca2+]i. Captopril significantly attenuated the AVP-induced [Ca2+]i increase in VSMC and MC. The preincubation of MC with 1 mumol/l captopril for 40 min significantly reduced the PDGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase in MC from 127 +/- 31 nmol/l (n = 11) to 61 +/- 32 nmol/l (n = 5, p < 0.05). The present results may indicate that part of the protective effects of ACE inhibitors on vasculature and kidney may be promoted by inhibition of growth-factor induced changes of calcium homeostasis.",

The peptides and isoproterenol displayed similar potencies (range of means pEC50[M]: 6.5-7.1). The maximum increase in cAMP (Emax in % of basal cAMP level) was similar for the peptides (range of means Emax: 2500-5100%). Pretreatment with the peptidase inhibitors captopril (10 microM) and phosphoramidon (1 microM) significantly increased the cAMP response to PACAP 1-38 (to 480% of control) only.",

Traditional therapies including phlebotomy and bilateral native nephrectomies are cumbersome for both the clinical personnel and the patient. Recently, pharmacological agents such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and theophylline have been proposed as effective therapies for post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE). We have treated a PTE patient successfully with enalapril without any side effects and renal dysfunction after theophylline treatment showed no improvement in PTE. A decline in Ht levels was independent of the changes in Epo levels during enalapril treatment. Although the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of enalapril remains undetermined, enalapril is recommended for the initial treatment of PTE.", 
    "189": "A nationwide survey, consisting of personal interviews with a representative sample of 2800 physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and hypertensive patients, was conducted to evaluate the current therapeutic management of hypertension in Spain. The most widely used antihypertensive drugs were angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (36.8%), followed by calcium channel blockers (28.1%), diuretics (24.8%), beta-blockers (16.1%), alpha-blockers (5.2%), and alpha/beta-blockers (4.5%). Combination drug therapy was prescribed for about 40% of hypertensive patients. The characteristics most highly valued by the different groups when selecting an antihypertensive agent are presented, as are the antihypertensive drugs preferred for treating high blood pressure associated with various pathological conditions. More than a quarter of the hypertensive patients surveyed (27.6%) indicated that they experienced some side effects with their antihypertensive medication. This, together with the failure to adequately control blood pressure, was the main reason that physicians cited for switching therapy. Approximately three-quarters of the patient respondents reported good compliance with their antihypertensive regimen. Physicians, however, reported total compliance for only 6% of their patients. Factors contributing to noncompliance were analysed. The implications of these results for the treatment of hypertension in Spain are discussed.", 
    "190": "Angioedema as a side effect of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is often under-recognized. We analyzed the subjects seen in our out-patient clinic for angioedema. Over the past 3 years, we have found a cause-effect relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment and angioedema in 14 of the 334 subjects presenting with this condition.", 
    "191": "There has been some concern raised regarding the safe use of ACE-inhibitors in patients with severe renal insufficiency, including the development of hyperkalaemia in these patients. Therefore, the objective of the current analysis was to evaluate the long-term safety of enalapril in patients with severe renal sufficiency and hypertension. Three protocols with similar randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled designs were selected for analysis. A total of 153 patients, enrolled at six sites, were treated for up to 3 years with enalapril; 164 patients served as controls. One protocol used a fixed dose (5 mg/day) of enalapril, while the other two protocols allowed open titration up to 40 mg/day. The primary comparison was between the enalapril and control populations. For the analysis, patients, by treatment, were grouped according to the degree of renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > or < 3 mg/dl) at baseline. The incidence of the most common, as well as important, clinical and laboratory adverse events for this patient population were summarized. In addition, trends in important laboratory adverse events and the incidence of first-dose events, cough and angioedema were evaluated. The incidence of clinical adverse events was similar for both treatment groups, regardless of the severity of renal insufficiency. Seven patients died, four in the control group and three in the enalapril treatment group; none was considered related to treatment. Enalapril appeared to be well-tolerated in this group of patients with severe renal impairment.",

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) results in a 50% reduction of proteinuria as measured in 24-h urine collections. We questioned whether anti-proteinuric treatment by blockade of the RAS is as effective during the day as during the night.", 
    "193": "We analysed data from two intervention studies on proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. In the first study, six hospitalized patients (proteinuria 5.8 +/- 2.9 g/day) were treated with the renin-inhibitor remikiren 600 mg o.d. during 8 days. In the second study eight ambulant patients (proteinuria 7.5 +/- 2.7 g/day) were treated during 6 weeks with the ACE-inhibitor trandolapril 4 mg o.d. Urine was collected in a day- and in a night-time portion.", 
    "194": "Daytime proteinuria declined from 0.29 +/- 0.15 to 0.22 +/- 0.11 g/h (P < 0.05) during remikiren and from 0.33 +/- 0.14 to 0.16 +/- 0.08 g/h (P < 0.05) during trandolapril. Night-time proteinuria, however, was not significantly reduced from 0.23 +/- 0.11 to 0.19 +/- 0.11 g/h during remikiren and from 0.29 +/- 0.17 to 0.20 +/- 0.12 g/h during trandolapril. Both interventions effectively lowered blood pressure during the day as well as the night.", 
    "195": "In both studies relative nocturnal therapy resistance to the antiproteinuric effect of RAS blockade was found, despite 24-h efficacy of blood pressure effect. This may have clinical relevance because it contributes to rest-proteinuria and thus may affect long term renal function outcome. It may be worthwhile to explore alternative therapeutic regimens to improve the nocturnal antiproteinuric response.", 
    "196": "The renal response to ACE inhibition is known to vary between individuals. The ACE genotype is a determinant of the ACE concentrations in plasma and tissue, and therefore might affect the renal response to ACE inhibition in renal patients.", 
    "197": "To test this hypothesis we studied the short-term response to ACE inhibition (enalapril or lisinopril 10/20 mg/d) in 61 stable proteinuric patients (> 1.0 g/day) in relation to the ACE genotype (DD N = 16, ID N = 32, II N = 13).", 
    "198": "Baseline values were not significantly different for the three groups. ACE inhibition significantly reduced proteinuria, mean arterial pressure, GFR and FF in all genotype groups. The reduction in proteinuria, MAP, GFR and FF was not different between the genotype groups. ERPF increased significantly and to the same extent in all three groups.", 
    "199": "We conclude that in proteinuric patients the short-term responses to ACE inhibition of proteinuria, blood pressure, and renal haemodynamics are not determined by ACE genotype. Thus, ACE gene polymorphism does not account for the known interindividual variation in the short-term renal response to ACE inhibition.",

Urinary albumin to creatinine ratio was significantly reduced during losartan (from 1.14(x/divided by 2.48) (geometric mean (x/divided by antilog SD) to 0.81 (x/divided by 2.43) mg/mmol, P < 0.01), as well as during enalapril (from 0.95 (x/divided by 2.45) to 0.73 (x/divided by 2.00) mg/mmol, both P < 0.05). The effect on albuminuria was especially evident in patients with microalbuminuria. Fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were unchanged during losartan, whereas minor reductions were found in all lipids during enalapril. No difference was observed between the groups.", 
    "203": "Enalapril 20 mg and losartan 50 mg daily reduce blood pressure equally in essential hypertensive patients. No adverse effects were seen on glucose and lipid concentrations. Losartan treatment reduces albuminuria at least as effectively as enalapril, suggesting that glomerular leakage of albumin is profoundly affected by the effects angiotensin II.", 
    "204": "We examined the effect of pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione derivative that increases insulin sensitivity without increasing insulin secretion, on the development and maintenance of hypertension in sucrose-fed SHR. Nine-week-old male SHR received 12% sucrose dissolved in tap water as drinking water. For 5 weeks, half of the rats were given regular rat chow, and the rest were fed with rat chow containing 0.03% pioglitazone. In week 6, blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were examined before and after oral glucose administration by gavage. Sucrose treatment elicited a significant elevation of systolic blood pressure 3 weeks after the beginning of treatment; pioglitazone treatment attenuated this elevation. The insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia observed in sucrose-fed SHR were prevented by pioglitazone treatment. Pioglitazone treatment also significantly reduced the urinary excretion of catecholamines and plasma renin activity, both of which were significantly greater in sucrose-fed SHR than in control SHR. Along with improving insulin sensitivity, pioglitazone treatment also attenuated the development of hypertension in SHR fed the regular rat chow, but not in WKY rats. These results indicate that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia play an important role in the development of hypertension in SHR probably through the activation of the renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous outflow. This study also shows that chronic sucrose treatment exacerbated the development of hypertension through these mechanisms, precipitating insulin resistance.", 
    "205": "The increased sympathetic drive in chronic heart failure (CHF) might provoke vascular adrenoceptor desensitization, which, together with endothelial dysfunction, could contribute to the altered vasomotor tone seen in CHF. We investigated 1) whether CHF alters the responses mediated by alpha and beta adrenoceptors in small and large peripheral arteries, and 2) the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Rats with CHF (coronary artery ligation) were treated with placebo or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (10 mg/kg/d) starting 7 days after ligation. Responses to phenylephrine (alpha 1 agonist), salbutamol (beta 2 agonist) as well as acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent), were assessed after 3 months in isolated and pressurized segments of the abdominal aorta, the femoral and the mesenteric arteries. In animals with hemodynamic signs of CHF, neither the vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine nor the vasodilator response to salbutamol were affected. In contrast, the dilator response to acetylcholine of both small arteries, but not that of the aorta, was impaired. Furthermore, CHF did not modify vessel structure. While lisinopril did not modify the responses to adrenergic agonists, it normalized the response to acetylcholine. Furthermore, ACE inhibition reduced vascular media cross sectional area and collagen density. Thus, the unchanged arterial responsiveness to adrenoceptor agonists does not indicate any vascular adrenoceptor desensitization, while endothelial dependent vasodilation of small arteries is impaired in CHF. ACE inhibition does not modify the response to adrenergic stimuli, prevents endothelial dysfunction and induces both cardiac and vascular remodeling, which probably contribute to the effect ACE inhibitors have on exercise tolerance and survival.", 
    "206": "A randomised trial of simvastatin and enalapril in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis: effects on serum lipoprotein concentrations and left ventricular mass. Left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are both possible contributors to the high risk of cardiovascular death in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis. We investigated the effects of simvastatin on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the effects of enalapril on left ventricular mass in 107 patients receiving haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Patients were randomised in a factorial design to receive simvastatin (10 mg daily) or placebo and enalapril (2.5-5 mg daily) or placebo. During follow-up, there was a significant excess of patients withdrawn from enalapril because of hypotension (2p = 0.002), and after 6 months only 55% of those assigned enalapril were still on treatment. From baseline to 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in left ventricular mass or left ventricular dimensions between patients assigned enalapril and those assigned placebo. Among the patients assigned simvastatin, total cholesterol was reduced by 13% (2p = 0.001), LDL cholesterol was reduced by 17% (2p = 0.003) and apolipoprotein B was reduced by 12% (2p = 0.005) compared to patients assigned placebo. There were borderline significant (2p = 0.05 to 0.08) reductions in VLDL cholesterol, total triglyceride and VLDL triglycerides of 26%, 12% and 17% respectively. Large-scale trials are now required to determine whether reductions in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations confer a reduction in coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis.",

Both the environmental factors and genetic predisposition have an influence on the pathogenesis of these diseases. Despite we know lots of environmental risk factors and we made important advances in the prevention and treatment of mentioned diseases, our knowledge about the pathogenic linkage between genetic predisposition and cardiovascular diseases is still very little. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system has been proposed as a very important step in the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis. In spite of vasoconstrictor activity, angiotensin II can stimulate migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophage-foam cells formation, adhesion and aggregation of platelets and fibrinolytic system inhibition. Angiotensin convertin enzyme inhibitors reduce the development of the atherosclerotic process after vascular injury and in hyperlipidemic animals. Blockade of renin-angiotensin system seems to be also effective in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction in men. In sum, the genetic variations inside the renin-angiotensin system which may affect the function of its components might have an influence on genetic predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. The paper deals with the current state of knowledge on association between polymorphic variations in renin gene, angiotensinogen gene, angiotensin converting enzyme gene and AT1 receptor gene and primary hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction.", 
    "208": "Hypertension may to be both, cause and the results of the renal dysfunction. The N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) is a lysosomal enzyme of renal proximal tubular cells. An elevation of the enzyme activity in urine was observed in kidney diseases and also in hypertension. The aim of our study was the evaluation of the influence of the 6-months-lasting enalapril therapy on function of renal tubules and glomeruli in patients with essential hypertension. This study included 30 patients with essential hypertension (I-II grade according to WHO criteria), divided into two groups according to the initial NAG activity in urine: I-with normal NAG activity, II-with elevated NAG activity. Enalapril administered in doses 2.5-10 mg per day. The urine NAG activity, the urine and serum creatinine concentrations, the urea serum concentration and the creatinine clearance were determined after 2, 4, 8 weeks, 3 and 6 months of enalapril therapy. Simultaneously, the blood pressure and the heart rate were measured and the resting ECG was registered. In the course of the 6-months enalapril therapy of hypertension, NAG activity in urine in the group II was declined to normal values, the creatinine concentration in the urine increased in groups I and II, and the blood pressure was significantly reduced. The results of our study imply that the monitoring of the NAG activity in urine during the enalapril therapy of hypertension, may to be a indicator of protective action of the drug on the kidney and its antihypertensive efficacy.",

Of 15 patients treated 66.6% responded to the 9-week course. Adjuvant hypothiazid elevated the effect to 73.6%. Moexipril lowered mean 24-h diastolic pressure without changing the 24-h pressure curve or heart rate. Antihypertensive moexipril effect was higher in the day time. Variability of diastolic arterial pressure was lower at night.", 
    "210": "The activities of glomerular intrinsic antioxidant enzymes (AOEs) were measured in a diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model. The effects of antihypertensive drugs, i.e. captopril or triple therapy (hydralazine, reserpine, and hydrochlorothiazide), on glomerular intrinsic AOE activities in this model were evaluated. The effects of blood glucose control on the AOE activities were also determined. The aim of the present study was to determine whether activities of glomerular intrinsic AOEs might correlate with disease activity in diabetic SHR. This study showed a decrease of glomerular intrinsic AOE, i.e. Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD (SOD = superoxide dismutase), glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, activities in diabetic SHR. Glomerular Cu/Zn-SOD or Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities in nondiabetic SHR were slightly lower than those in nondiabetic WKY rats. These activities in diabetic SHR were significantly improved after captopril or triple therapy or blood glucose control. The levels of urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, and glomerular tuft areas in diabetic SHR were also improved after the therapy. It appears that hypertension and hyperglycemia may influence the glomerular intrinsic AOE activities, albuminuria, creatinine clearance, and glomerular tuft areas in diabetic SHR. Thus, it is indicated that control of blood pressure or blood glucose is a very important factor for preventing renal injuries in the diabetic SHR model.",

    "219": "The effects of captopril, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on responses to bradykinin (BK), to angiotensin (Ang) I and II, and to other agonists were investigated in the hindquarters vascular bed of the rat. Under conditions of controlled flow, intra-arterial (i.a.) injections of BK in doses of 0.1-1.0 microgram, produced dose related decreases in hindquarters perfusion pressure and evoked decreases in systemic arterial pressure. Intra-arterial injections of Ang I and II produced dose-related increases in hindquarters perfusion pressure. Following administration of captopril in a dose of 2 mg/kg i.v., vasodilator responses to i.a. injections of BK were only slightly enhanced in the hindquarters vascular bed, whereas the evoked systemic vasodepressor responses to i.a. injections of BK were markedly enhanced by the ACE inhibitor. Captopril significantly reduced vasoconstrictor responses to i.a. injections of Ang I, whereas vasoconstrictor responses to i.a. injections of Ang II were significantly enhanced. The ACE inhibitor did not significantly alter vasodilator responses to i.a. injections of acetylcholine, nitroglycerin, nitric oxide, albuterol, or pinacidil. The present data show that BK has potent vasodilator activity in the hindquarters vascular bed of the rat and suggest that the site of action is most likely upstream from the site of inactivation, whereas the site of action of Ang I is at or near the site of conversion to Ang II in the hindquarters vascular bed. The observation that the evoked systemic vasodepressor responses to i.a. injections of BK were greatly enhanced, suggest that the lung is the major site of inactivation of BK.", 
    "220": "Based on 2 case presentations - acute renal failure (ARF) due to myeloma kidney and due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration in the presence of transplant artery stenosis - new aspects in the pathogenesis of ARF are presented and discussed. The multifactorial pathogenesis of ARF includes (a) a disturbance of glomerular microcirculation (afferent and perhaps mesangial constriction, inadequate efferent dilatation); (b) a disturbance of medullary microcirculation (medullary capillary congestion) attributed to a combination of endothelial damage and tubular dilatation; (c) tubular cell damage which, though rarely in humans justifying the term 'acute tubular necrosis', promotes both backleak of glomerular filtrate and shedding of brush border vesicles; (d) the latter promotes tubular obstruction by casts which consist of Tamm-Horsfall protein and brush border components. Once ARF is established, repair processes set in which appear to depend on growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor 1, of which there is a relative shortage in established ARF. Experimental therapeutic approaches focus on the restitution of microcirculation (endothelin receptor antagonists, atriopeptins), interference with cast formation (integrin receptor blockers), and the promotion of recovery by growth factors.", 
    "221": "The recent development of a transgenic rat strain bearing the mouse ren-2 renin gene [TGR(mRen2)27] has provided a new monogenetic model of hypertension. Other hypertensive rat strains are characterized by a blunted pressure-diuresis-natriuresis response such that higher renal perfusion pressures are required to excrete normal amounts of water and sodium. Dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide systems may cause in this abnormality. This study examined the effect of enalapril on the pressure-natriuresis response and urinary nitric oxide metabolite excretion in 6-month-old TGR(mRen2)27 rats. The slope of the line relating renal perfusion pressure and urine flow rate in TGR (0.08+/-0.01 microl x min(-1) x g kidney weight(-1) mm Hg[-1]) was significantly lower than that in control rats (0.15+/-0.01 microl x min(-1) x g kidney weight(-1) mm Hg[-1]). Pressure-natriuresis responses were also shifted to higher pressure levels in TGR. Treatment with enalapril for 3 months lowered the mean arterial pressure from 94+/-2 to 84+/-4 mm Hg in control rats and from 146+/-3 to 89+/-3 mm Hg in TGR. The slopes of lines relating renal perfusion pressure and urine flow rate as well as sodium excretion were significantly increased by enalapril in control and transgenic animals. Urinary nitric oxide metabolite excretion rose similarly with increasing renal perfusion pressure in both control and TGR rats and was not affected by enalapril. These results confirm that older TGR rats have a blunted pressure-diuresis-natriuresis response that can be corrected by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and suggest that their production of nitric oxide is normal.", 
    "222": "A 58-year-old man with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was treated with incremental administration of a beta-blocker (metoprolol) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enarapril). The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and ejection fraction improved in 8 months from 83.3 mm and 17.3% to 46 mm and 69%, respectively. The washout ratio and heart-to-mediastinum ratio depicted on the delayed image for iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine 123I-MIBG) uptake improved from 61.7% and 1.34 to 23.1% and 1.85, respectively, in association with improvement of left ventricular indices. Successive endomyocardial biopsy specimens disclosed reduction of the degrees of vacuolation, staining irregularity, and deformity of myocyte cytoplasm and nucleus compared to the findings before therapy. In this patient with dilated cardiomyopathy 123I-MIBG scintigraphy was useful for the evaluation of the effects of therapy. We conclude that it may be informative in the estimation of the histopathological abnormalities of the myocardium.", 
    "223": "The splanchnic circulation is one of the largest vascular regions in man. In the past, this has been difficult to study because of methodological problems. The adapting of noninvasive Doppler techniques has made it possible to develop reproducible measurements of coeliac and superior mesenteric artery blood flow, which are the main contributors to the gastrointestinal vasculature. This has resulted in the further understanding of neurogenic and humoral control of this region in a number of physiological and pathophysiological states, and has contributed towards the knowledge of its pharmacological control. These studies are of relevance to cardiovascular homeostasis and, in particular, systemic blood pressure control which depends upon various factors including responses in different vascular regions. In this review the key physiological factors which influence pharmacological studies on this circulation will be discussed. Examples will be provided, in subjects with cardiovascular and neurological disorders, of how administration of endogenous and exogenous substances, including drugs with specific pharmacological effects, alter human gastrointestinal blood flow. These will include insulin, alcohol, the somatostatin analogue octreotide, the central acting sympatholytic clonidine and the angiotensin II-converting inhibitor captopril. The relevance of these studies to subjects with postural hypotension due to sympathetic denervation and to primary hypertension, in particular, will be discussed.",

The ramipril dose was titrated from 2.5 to 20 mg daily to achieve a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. All patients received a stable dose of ramipril for three months. Viscosity measurements were made at 37 degrees C with the Mettler Contraves LS-40 microviscometer. Fibrinogen was determined by the Clauss method by averaging three separately acquired plasma samples. The systolic blood pressure (mean +/- standard deviation) was lowered from 141.2 +/- 9.1 to 129.2 +/- 11.2 mm Hg (p = 0.005) and the diastolic blood pressure was lowered from 95.2 +/- 4.9 to 84.2 +/- 7.3 mm Hg (p = 0.0001). In 13 patients with mild to moderate diastolic hypertension, blood pressure reduction with ramipril was accompanied by no significant changes in blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, serum viscosity or fibrinogen.", 
    "225": "In an open trial, the pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril and its active metabolite ramiprilat were studied in 12 patients with liver cirrhosis. After a single oral dose of 5 mg ramipril plasma levels of the parent compound reached peak concentrations of 48.6 +/- 39.8 ng/ml after 0.7 +/- 0.5 h and declined rapidly to 0.7 +/- 1.2 ng/ml after 8 h. Plasma levels of ramiprilat reached peak concentrations of 3.8 +/- 2.9 ng/ml after 3.0 +/- 2.2 h, thereafter declined slowly and could be detected up to 240 h. The total recovery of ramipril and metabolites in urine within 96 h was on average 46.0 +/- 10.9% of the administered dose. Major fractions were due to diketopiperazines and glucuronides of ramipril and ramiprilat. The overall ACE inhibition was still 92.0 +/- 8.6%. In conclusion, patients with liver cirrhosis had enough capacity to metabolize and excrete the parent compound ramipril, but had not enough capacity to form ramiprilat, although enough ramiprilat was formed for sufficient ACE inhibition of about 90%. This indicates that titration of the dose should start with 5 mg or even lower doses in patients with markedly impaired liver function.",

They were requested to complete interviewer-administered questionnaires before angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment and at follow-up 4 weeks later. The interviewer administered the SF-36, COOP charts, the oxygen cost diagram and also asked patients to assess their health state overall and, after treatment, to assess changes, if any, in overall health.", 
    "228": "multi-dimensional health status measures indicate that patient's functioning and well-being is substantially compromised by CHF, especially in areas relating to physical functioning, and that treatment with ACE inhibitors has only limited effect in improving health-related quality of life. However, on simple single-item global assessments of health, patients report that their overall health-related quality of life is good and many report improvements in overall health status at follow-up.", 
    "229": "ACE inhibitor treatment, whilst lengthening life, has a relatively limited impact on its quality. While multidimensional health status measures indicate CHF to be associated with poor health as measured by the SF-36 and COOP charts. However, when patients are asked simple single-item questions relating to their overall health state and the extent of change experienced after treatment, they report relatively good health and positive improvements as a consequence of therapy. Since elderly patients' expectations of improvement may be modest and their expectations of physical ability relatively limited, relatively small improvements, which may not appear large when reported in effect size statistics, may be important. Standardized questionnaires, and standardized statistical methods of assessing change, may not be appropriate for this patient group. A fuller understanding of their expectations and assessment of treatment outcomes is necessary.", 
    "230": "We have compared the endothelium-dependent responses of thoracic aortic rings obtained from age-matched male and female SHR in order to explore gender differences in the effectiveness of antihypertensive drug therapy in correcting the endothelial dysfunction found in these animals. For this, concentration-effect curves to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were obtained using aortic rings with and without endothelium isolated from male and female rats which had or had not been pre-treated with enalapril for 72 h (acute) or 15 d (chronic). The maximal responses achieved and the EC50s were determined. The blood pressure of male and female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) decreased to normal levels within 72 h of initiating treatment with enalapril and remained normal during the remainder of the treatment period (15 d). However, enalapril was not effective in restoring a normal blood pressure in all of the male and female SHR. Female SHR were more responsive to enalapril after both acute and chronic treatment (70% of the females and 45% of the males became normotensive). Enalapril corrected the decreased response to acetylcholine in male but not in female SHR. An increased sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent vasodilator, was observed after acute or chronic treatment with enalapril in aortic rings with endothelium from male SHR. Indomethacin restored the decreased response to acetylcholine in aortic rings from enalapril-treated females and potentiated the response to acetylcholine in aortic rings from treated male SHR. We conclude that: a) there are significant differences in the responses of male and female SHR to enalapril, b) the imbalance in endothelium-dependent relaxing and contracting factors in SHR is corrected by enalapril in male but not in female SHR, c) correction of the endothelial dysfunction probably occurs independently of the normalization of blood pressure levels and appears to be gender-dependent.", 
    "231": "High-risk strategies represent important preventive measures that focus on individuals with a defined high risk of suffering a chronic disease. They are valuable in addition to measures of prevention within the general population. One example for a high-risk approach for stroke prevention is the treatment of hypertension in individuals that have previously suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Data from the Klosterneuburg Stroke Data Bank and other sources enable an estimate of 2000 TIAs occurring in Austria each year, half of them being hypertensives that are mostly not treated or not sufficiently treated for their hypertension. A high-risk programme that implies forced and effective treatment of hypertension would prevent some 400 strokes or 3% of 16,000 first-ever strokes per year. Costs for preventing one stroke by means of Betablocker agents would amount to ATS 3500 and by ACE-inhibitor agents ATS 11,500, respectively. In addition to general preventive measures, such a programme would have an important impact on stroke incidence and public health.", 
    "232": "Strategies are described for constructing pharmacophoric 3D database queries, based on a series of active and inactive analogs. The results are highly selective database queries, which are consistent with the generally accepted pharmacophore for a number of systems. The foundation of these strategies is the method of Mayer, Naylor, Motoc and Marshall [J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design, 1 (1987) 3] for inferring a unique binding geometry for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The strategies described here generalize their approach to cases where the chemical features responsible for binding are not a priori apparent, and to cases where the binding geometry deduced by that method is not unique. The key new insight, the selectivity principle, is to rank the multiple solutions produced by the method of Mayer et al. by their selectivity, a value that is related to the proportion of a database that is returned as a database hit list. Retrospective analyses are described for D2-antagonists, ACE inhibitors, fibrinogen antagonists, and beta 2-antagonists.", 
    "233": "In this review, we present background material that provides partial support for a tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Evidence for the existence of this system relied in part on the use of drugs, which has entailed using low doses or concentrations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, renin inhibitors, and angiotensin antagonists to block the RAS in vascular beds and in isolated arteries or organs. Other evidence for a tissue RAS has depended upon measurements of the components of the system, i.e. enzymes, substrates, and mRNAs for these proteins. All of these components were first believed to be present in the heart and blood vessels; however, it is now known that renin in the circulating blood derived from the kidney is used for the local synthesis of angiotensins. The main emphasis of the review is on the renal RAS because it is believed that the local RAS is most prominent in this organ. The renal RAS is probably involved in the long-rather than short-term regulation of renal vascular resistance and maintenance of normal blood pressure through the regulation of sodium reabsorption.", 
    "234": "The increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in India, and the established efficacy of mortality-reducing therapies in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) served as the impetus to compare the management practices of AMI in an Indian hospital and a similar hospital in Canada. A retrospective chart review in each hospital was conducted to identify differences in risk factors, presentation, and acute in-hospital management in patients with AMI. Indian patients were younger (47 +/- 9 years versus 54 +/- 8 years), more likely to have a history of diabetes (21/87 versus 6/69) and less likely to have a previous history of angina (5/87 versus 22/69) compared to Canadian patients (all p < 0.001). The delay from symptom onset to hospital arrival was greater in Bangalore, India (median time 330 min versus 101 min, p < 0.001), yet the in-hospital delay in receiving thrombolytic therapy was greater in Hamilton, Canada (70.5 min in Hamilton versus 30 min in Bangalore, p < 0.0001). There was similarity and appropriate use of thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in both centres. The pattern of presentation and risk factors differ in Indian and Canadian patients. However, once patients present, the patterns of practice appear to be similar.", 
    "235": "Based on our earlier animal study, we became interested to investigate if thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is involved in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) induced cough in man. To 11 patients with hypertension, who had developed cough induced by ACE inhibitors, a TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, ozagrel was given for 1 to 2 months together with the ACE inhibitors. One patient developed headache induced by ozagrel and was eliminated from the study after 3 weeks. In other 10 patients, no obvious drug attributable abnormality was observed in subjective and objective symptoms or laboratory tests. In ten patients, cough scores were taken just before and after the administration of a combination of an ACE inhibitor with ozagrel. Median values of cough scores after the combination was significantly (p=0.012) lower than before the combination. Ozagrel reduced cough scores in 5 patients, completely suppressed cough in 3 patients and in 2 of 10 patients, ozagrel did not affect cough scores. Our observations suggest that TXA2 may somehow, mediate coughing induced by the ACE inhibitors. Further, patients on ACE inhibitors who develop cough may benefit from TXA2 synthetase inhibitors.", 
    "236": "Nisoldipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). It is the most vascular selective of the currently available CCBs, and thus has the capacity to lower blood pressure without affecting the functioning of the myocardium and skeletal muscle, and without producing any negative inotropic effects. Nisoldipine coat core (CC) is an extended-release formulation that allows nisoldipine to be released gradually over 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations in plasma concentration and providing a good trough/peak ratio. It has a slow onset and long duration of action, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has demonstrated that its antihypertensive effect is maintained over 24 hours with no evidence of reflex tachycardia, hypotension, or sympathetic neurohormonal activation and no effects on circadian variation. Studies in patients with hypertension have shown that nisoldipine CC provides reductions in blood pressure that are at least equivalent to those seen with diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other CCBs, without deleterious effects on metabolic parameters. In particular, it has been found to be effective in elderly patients and in black patients with severe hypertension. The DEFIANT studies have demonstrated that nisoldipine CC improves cardiac function and exercise tolerance in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction, without increasing the risk of mortality compared with placebo. It also improves exercise performance in patients with stable angina pectoris. Nisoldipine CC is well tolerated in all groups of patients, with the most frequently reported side effects being headache and peripheral edema, which are usually mild and transient.", 
    "237": "Periodically in the history of hypertensive therapy there have been minor storms that have significantly affected the utilization of entire classes of agents. The first storm struck with the case-control studies suggesting that reserpine was associated with an increased risk of carcinoma of the breast, a claim subsequently disproved by a number of other studies. The second storm was initiated by a subanalysis of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), from which it was inferred that, in a subset of hypertensive patients, diuretic treatment may have been harmful rather than beneficial. Despite this claim and other speculations, diuretics-especially at low doses-remain a gold standard of antihypertensive therapy. Recently, a third storm has developed in the field of antihypertensive therapy: a case-control study report and a non-randomized cohort study have questioned the use of calcium channel blockers in hypertension. The case-control study suffers from the limitations inherent in this study design, which often gives rise to conflicts and contradiction. In fact, another case-control study published in 1995 reached exactly the opposite conclusions and claimed that calcium channel blockers were associated with significantly less myocardial infarction than traditional antihypertensive therapy. A meta-analysis was also presented as supporting the non-randomized studies questioning the safety of calcium channel blockers. However, it refers to patients with coronary heart disease, not to patients with hypertension, and also combined studies performed with different aims, and data from short-term and long-term studies using short-acting formulations of calcium channel blockers. The controversies generated by these reports have gone well beyond their scientific merit. For final judgement we should wait for well-designed prospective studies, several of which are under way. For the time being, there is no reason to change the current practice of antihypertensive therapy, as summarized in the recommendations of both the United States Joint National Committee and the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension Committee, that is, diuretics and beta-blockers are among those antihypertensive agents with clearly proven benefits in mortality-morbidity studies, but calcium channel blockers as well as ACE inhibitors and alpha-blockers can also be used profitably in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "238": "The benefits of lowering elevated arterial blood pressure have been documented in many intervention trials. Initially, such studies included only patients with malignant hypertension, and very convincing improvements in the 5-year survival rate were demonstrated in several reports. Subsequent large-scale intervention studies included patients with non-malignant forms of hypertension. Again, significant improvements in cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality were shown. Recent epidemiological data from the USA and Sweden suggest that the pattern of hypertension and its associated morbidity is changing, probably due to earlier diagnosis and treatment. The aims of this review are to describe some of the important steps that have been taken in the area of hypertension over the last few decades and to try to evaluate the status of current antihypertensive therapies. Particular emphasis will be given to discussing some of the issues and questions that are currently under investigation, for example the status of novel therapies, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the issue of the level to which blood pressure should be lowered in order to extract the maximum benefit from antihypertensive treatment. Some of the ongoing large-scale intervention trials in hypertension will also be reviewed.", 
    "239": "The aim of this study was to assess whether an interaction exists between the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system at the level of the adrenal medulla during smoking in normal humans. Thirteen habitual smoking volunteers were studied in a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, cross-over fashion using 50 mg captopril vs placebo followed by smoking of two high nicotine content cigarettes within 15 min. Blood samples were obtained at frequent intervals before, during and after smoking. We found that the increase in plasma adrenaline concentration during cigarette smoking was modest. There was no difference between captopril treatment as compared to placebo. Thus, the adrenaline response to cigarette smoking was not blunted by acute blockade of angiotensin II generation. A significant increase in heart rate, and blood pressure was found as well. No increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration was found. Plasma renin concentration increased significantly during captopril treatment, whereas it decreased throughout the study period in the placebo phase. Plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased in both the captopril treatment and the placebo phase throughout the study period, but this was more pronounced during captopril treatment. In conclusion, cigarette smoking-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system was not blunted by acute ACE-inhibition by captopril. This indicates that angiotensin II does not facilitate smoking-induced activation of sympathoadrenal activity in humans.", 
    "240": "The possible influence of impaired liver function on the pharmacokinetic disposition of imidapril, a novel prodrug type angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and its active metabolite, imidaprilat, was investigated.", 
    "241": "Eight subjects with normal liver function and eight patients with liver dysfunction received an oral dose of 10 mg imidapril once daily for 7 days.", 
    "242": "Plasma imidapril concentrations after single and, although less pronounced, after repeated dosing were higher in the liver disease patients, whereas imidaprilat concentrations were lower. This suggests that the conversion of imidapril into imidaprilat in the liver is delayed in patients with impaired liver function. However, the slower biotransformation did not result in statistically significant differences in Cmax and AUC for either imidapril or its active metabolite following repeated administration. Moreover, no relevant accumulation of either imidapril or imidaprilat occurred after repeated dosing.", 
    "243": "Imidapril is regarded as an ACE inhibitor of which the pharmacokinetic disposition is only slightly affected in patients with impaired liver function.", 
    "244": "It is clear that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors slow progression of diabetic nephropathy to a greater extent than other antihypertensive agents when blood pressure (BP) is reduced to levels below 140/90 mm Hg. Recent studies also demonstrate that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDCCBs) slow progression of diabetic nephropathy in people with pre-existing renal insufficiency secondary to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The combined effects of both a CCB and ACE inhibitor have recently been examined in both animal models of diabetes as well as patients with established diabetic nephropathy. These studies demonstrate the following points: (a) at comparable BP levels, a combination of an ACE inhibitor with a NDCCB result in a greater reduction in proteinuria when compared to either components alone; and (b) conversely, addition of an ACE inhibitor to a dihydropyridine CCB (DCCB) yields effects on proteinuria similar to the ACE inhibitor alone. Therefore, addition of an ACE inhibitor to a DCCB demonstrates protection against the effects of DCCB alone. Addition of an ACE inhibitor to a NDCCB does not potentiate the preservation of renal morphology associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy when compared to either of its components alone. Conversely, a DCCB/ACE inhibitor combination yields morphologic results similar to the ACE inhibitor alone. Taken together these results suggest that ACE inhibitors when combined with a NDCCB result in greater reductions in proteinuria, and similar preservation of renal morphology when compared to either of its components alone.", 
    "245": "The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) usually indicates that hypertension is moderately severe and that combination therapy will be required to control blood pressure (BP). Unfortunately, most studies on the reduction of LVH have been done with monotherapy. Our knowledge of combination therapy in the treatment of hypertensive heart disease is to a great extent extrapolation from monotherapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in combination with calcium antagonists ought to be particularly efficacious in reducing LVH. Drug classes that either stimulate the renin angiotensin system or the sympathetic nervous system are less likely to reduce LVH and should be avoided. In hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure, amlodipine should be added to triple therapy with an ACE inhibitor, whereas in the post myocardial ischemia patient, verapamil may exert some additional beneficial effects with regard to reinfarction rates. Of note, given that two drugs when used separately are beneficial in a disorder does not necessarily mean that their combination is equally or even more beneficial. Thus, combination therapy should primarily be used for lowering arterial pressure and only secondarily to possibly improve concomitant pathophysiologic conditions associated with hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "246": "Hypertension is often accompanied by a variety of metabolic abnormalities. These metabolic abnormalities include insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and abnormalities of the coagulation-fibrinolytic system predisposing to a procoagulent state. The nexus for all of these abnormalities may be central (visceral) obesity. The dyslipidemia accompanying hypertension consists of low HDL cholesterol, elevated triglyceride levels and an abnormal more atherogenic LDL cholesterol particle. Dyslipidemia interacts with associated hemodynamic (ie, hypertension) and metabolic (ie, increased platelet aggregation and PAI-1 levels) in a multiplicative manner potentiating cardiovascular and renal disease. Accordingly, lipid therapy should be aggressive to attenuate these medical complications of essential hypertension.", 
    "247": "In recent years, evidence from various animals experiments has accumulated that emphasizes the role of endothelin-1 in the pathophysiology of several cardiovascular diseases, including congestive heart failure. The recent advent of potent antagonists of this system now allows the assessment of the involvement of endothelin-1 in the maintenance of vascular tone in animals and humans. We report hemodynamic data from two trails in patients with chronic severe congestive heart failure (i.e., reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of < 30%, elevated resting pulmonary capillary wedged pressure > 15 mmHg, and/or reduced cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m2 or less) who were treated with the mixed endothelin-type A and type B-receptor antagonist bosentan. In the first study, the acute effect of bosentan (300 mg, intravenous) on hemodynamics and neurohormones was investigated. Bosentan was well tolerated and significantly improved impaired hemodynamics due to systemic and venous vasodilation. In the second, trial, bosentan was given orally (0.5 g bid) for 14 days, in addition to conventional triple treatment for congestive heart failure, including digitalis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. Cardiac hemodynamics were monitored during the first 24 hours of treatment, and measurements were repeated during the last day of bosentan therapy. Bosentan was well tolerated in these patients as well, and hemodynamic measures were compatible with an additional effect of bosentan after 2 weeks. However, there was a slight increase in heart rate as well. Our result underline the importance of endogenously generated endothelin-1 in congestive heart failure and suggest a potential benefit of endothelin antagonism in such patients. However, long-term studies are needed to establish whether chronic endothelin antagonism has beneficial clinical effects and is capable of improving survival and/or symptoms in severe heart failure patients who remain symptomatic despite standard triple therapy.", 
    "248": "Most patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) are subjected to symptomatic treatment, predominantly with drugs. Over the years, it has become clear that treatment with unloading drugs is probably more beneficial than treatment with inotropic agents. In addition, it has been widely recognized that the neuroendocrine compensatory changes associated with CHF afford and important target for drug treatment. This may also hold for some of the changes in receptor density, such as the downregulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. The present and clearly changing insights into the backgrounds of drugs for the treatment of CHF are critically discussed. Apart from the changing views and appreciation of the currently used drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, digoxin, beta-adrenoceptor agonists), the following new approaches are discussed: beta-blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, ibopamine, calcium antagonists, inhibitors of ANP degradation, vasopression antagonist, vesnarinone, and calcium sensitizers.", 
    "249": "Clinical research in chronic heart failure has recently focused on the stimulated neuro-hormonal compensatory mechanisms that could contribute to auto-aggravation of the disease. On the basis of such a hypothesis, and apart from the inhibition of the renin angiotensin system, the antagonism of beta-receptors has evolved as a promising approach for improving quality of life and prognosis. However, the definite proof of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced benefit on survival remains to be demonstrated. On the basis of CIBIS I data, the objective of the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS II) is to evaluate effects of the selective beta-1 adrenoceptor blocker, bisoprolol, on mortality (primary endpoint) in patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic chronic heart failure. Eligible patients will be symptomatic ambulatory patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35% in NYHA functional class III or IV, receiving a background treatment of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A total of 2,500 patients are planned to be included with a mean follow up of at least 3 years. Secondary endpoints include hospitalisations, cardiovascular mortality and combination of both as well as permanent treatment withdrawal. Bisoprolol will be titrated up to 10 mg, starting with 1.25 mg daily. Randomization began in November 1995. CIBIS II results will represent a basis for definite conclusions on the evaluation of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced benefit with bisoprolol in chronic heart failure.", 
    "250": "Certain drugs may contribute to the etiology of depressive symptoms and depressive disorders. The objective of this review is to critically appraise the literature concerned with these potential etiological associations.", 
    "251": "The review was based on papers uncovered in electronic literature searches using Medline, Psychlit and Psychological Abstracts. Statistical power calculations were used to assist in the interpretation of negative results.", 
    "252": "A large number of publications were uncovered, but most of these were case reports. There were relatively few empirical studies. Corticosteroids, certain calcium channel blockers and digoxin have been associated with depression by replicated, well conducted studies. Psychostimulant withdrawal is also associated with prominent depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests that antihyperlipidemic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, sedative hypnotics, psychostimulants and certain hormonal agents may also cause depression. Despite an extensive literature, the potential association between beta-blockers and depressive symptoms remains controversial. There is no substantial evidence that l-dopa or histamine-2-receptor blockers cause depression and the literature is relatively conclusive in determining that thiazide diuretics are not associated with depressive symptoms.", 
    "253": "A small, but growing, literature confirms that certain drug exposures can contribute to the biopsychosocial etiology of depressive symptoms and disorders. Current beliefs and diagnostic conventions classify drug-induced depression into a distinct category (Substance-Induced Mood Disorder): but this approach is not specifically supported by the existing literature.", 
    "254": "This study assessed the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril on the main haemostatic variables in 22 patients, of either sex, with newly diagnosed uncomplicated essential hypertension. In the patients and in 10 control subjects, plasma levels of thrombomodulin, beta-thromboglobulin, D-dimer, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) had previously been measured. Only the levels of t-PA and PAI-1 were found to be higher than in controls. All these haemostatic evaluations were carried out after 6 and 12 months of treatment with an ACE inhibitor, cilazapril, 5 mg/day. This treatment significantly lowered the mean arterial pressure in the whole group from 133 to 106 mm Hg (after 6 months) and to 105 mm Hg (after 12 months), p < 0.05. No significant difference in any haemostatic parameters was observed after 6 and 12 months of treatment. The present study confirmed that treatment with cilazapril for 12 months lowers daytime ambulatory mean arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension, without any significant increase in the tendency of blood to clot.", 
    "255": "To investigate current drug therapy for elderly hypertensive patients, we performed a case-card study at Sapporo Medical University and its branch hospitals. The case-card was designed to show prescriptions given for hypertension, complications, and blood pressure. In the 2897 valid cases, calcium antagonists were prescribed in 76.3%, followed by beta-blockers (31.4%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) (25.1%) and natriuretic diuretics (18.1%). When the patients were divided into an elderly group (> or = 65 y.o., n = 1475), beta-blockers and ACE-I were found to be more frequently used in the non-elderly group, and diuretics were more frequently prescribed in the elderly group. Calcium antagonists were the most frequently used drugs, irrespective of age. As monotherapy drugs, calcium antagonists were chosen most frequently in both groups. Diuretics were the second most frequently used drug in the elderly group, but beta-blockers occupied that position in the younger group and these patients as a whole. In the elderly group, the manner of prescription was analyzed according to major complications. In patients with ischemic heart disease, beta-blockers and diuretics were used more frequently than in patients without that condition. Diuretics were prescribed more frequently in patients with renal dysfunction. Calcium antagonists and ACE-I were used more frequently in the patients with diabetes mellitus. The same differences were found in the non-elderly patients with those complications. However, among patients with stroke, calcium antagonists were more frequently used in the elderly group and ACE-I were performed in the younger patients. In conclusion, calcium antagonists were used very often regardless of age, and the other drugs were used according to age-dependent differences in pathophysiologic mechanism.", 
    "256": "We studied the relationship between renal hemodynamic changes induced by a single acute administration of captopril (50 mg p.o.) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in 27 healthy human volunteers, 7 with DD genotype, 10 with ID, and 10 with II genotype. The increase in effective renal plasma flow (p < 0.02) and the fall in renal vascular resistance (p < 0.01) in response to captopril were significantly less in subjects with the DD genotype than in subjects with the other genotypes. These data suggest that intrarenal ACE inhibition by captopril differs according to ACE gene ID polymorphism in healthy humans.",

    "258": "The effects of ACE inhibition with ramipril (1 mg.kg-1.day-1) on relaxation responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY).", 
    "259": "The 12-week-long therapy effectively reduced blood pressure in SHR. In noradrenaline (NA)-precontracted arterial rings, endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (ACh) as well as endothelium-independent dilations to isoprenaline and nitroprusside were more pronounced in WKY and ramipril-treated SHR than in untreated SHR. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, diclofenac, which reduces the synthesis of dilating and constricting prostanoids, clearly enhanced the relaxation to ACh in untreated SHR, but was without effect in the other groups. The nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), attenuated the relaxations to ACh more effectively in untreated SHR than in the ramipril-SHR and WKY groups. However, when endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization was prevented by precontracting the preparations with potassium chloride (KCl), no significant differences were found in relaxations to ACh between the study groups. In addition, in NA-precontracted rings the diclofenac- and L-NAME-resistant relaxations to ACh were partially prevented by glibenclamide and apamin, inhibitors of ATP-dependent and Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels, respectively.", 
    "260": "Long-term ACE inhibition normalized blood pressure and enhanced arterial dilation in SHR. The improved endothelium-mediated relaxation following ramipril therapy could be attributed to reduced release of cyclo-oxygenase-derived constricting factors and augmented endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization in this type of experimental hypertension.", 
    "261": "Angiotensin II has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The purpose of this study was to asses the effects of enalaprilat and L-158,809, an angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist, on LV diastolic function in 16 normal control dogs and 20 LVH dogs with perinephritic hypertension.", 
    "262": "LV hemodynamics was studied before and after intravenous injection of enalaprilat (0.25 mg/kg) or L-158,809 (0.3 mg/kg). The hemodynamic data were analyzed in relation to the changes in myocardial blood flow (measured by radioactive microspheres) and in the circulating angiotensin II and norepinephrine levels.", 
    "263": "At baseline, significant increases were observed for LV/body weight ratio as well as LV systolic and end-diastolic pressure in the LVH dogs (all P < 0.01 vs. the control group). In addition, LV relaxation time constant was prolonged and the chamber and myocardial stiffness constants were increased (P < 0.01) in the LVH dogs, suggesting an impairment of LV diastolic function. Administration of enalaprilat or L-158,809 improved LV stiffness constants in the LVH dogs (P < 0.05). The diastolic LV pressure-diameter relation shifted downwards in the LVH dogs whereas diastolic distensibility was not altered in the control dogs. Although the circulating angiotensin II levels were significantly decreased by enalaprilat in the LVH dogs, they did not correlate with the changes in the stiffness constants. Furthermore, the alterations of LV diastolic properties in the LVH group could not be attributed to myocardial perfusion, which was rather decreased by administration of enalaprilat and L-158,809. These results suggest that angiotensin II, particularly at the local level, is involved in the pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction in pressure-overload LVH. The data also support the concept that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are potentially beneficial in the treatment of the hypertrophied heart.", 
    "264": "We investigated a putative local angiotensin II (AngII) system in the rabbit retina by examining AngII contents in the retina, vitreous humor, and choroid by radioimmunoassays and AngII synthesis in the retina and choroid by detection of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA. An antibody directed against AngII was used to localize possible cellular sources of AngII in the retina. To enhance immunoreactivity and to further examine AngII metabolism, tissues were preincubated in medium containing either protease inhibitors (PI), PI together with the AngII-precursor AngI, or PI and AngII. In some experiments the conversion of AngI to AngII was blocked by an ACE inhibitor. AngII concentration in the vitreous humor was only about 10% of the plasma concentration; in the retina and the choroid, however, AngII concentrations were 10 and 86 times higher, respectively, than in the plasma. ACE mRNA was present in both retina and choroid. Immunohistochemistry for AngII revealed faintly labeled amacrine cells at the inner border of the inner nuclear layer of the retina. Preincubation with PI resulted in an enhanced immunoreaction and in the labeling of fibers in the inner and outer plexiform layer; M\u00fcller cells and their processes as well as ganglion cells were now stained as well but the specificity of ganglion cell staining remains questionable. The immunoreaction was further enhanced when AngI or AngII was added to the incubation medium, whereas labeling totally disappeared when the conversion of AngI to AngII was blocked. No immunoreactive cells were detected in the choroid. In conclusion, the synthesizing enzyme for AngII is expressed in the retina and a specific AngII concentration is maintained there; AngII is localized in distinct cell types and can be metabolized within these cells. These data point to a local retinal AngII system that is protected and independent of blood-borne AngII.", 
    "265": "Imidazoline I1-receptor agonism represents a new mode of antihypertensive action to inhibit peripheral alpha-adrenergic tone by a central mechanism. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and renin levels are reduced, a finding consistent with central inhibition of sympathetic tone. Acute haemodynamic studies indicate that moxonidine results in an acute decrease in blood pressure due to a fall in systemic vascular resistance, whereas the heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and pulmonary artery pressures are not affected. Left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes are reduced. Left ventricular hypertrophy has been found to regress after 6 months of treatment.",

Moxonidine is mostly excreted unchanged, and biotransformation is unimportant. The half-life of moxonidine is 2.5 h, which is prolonged by renal insufficiency.

Moxonidine has been compared with representatives from each important class of antihypertensive drugs, with clonidine, diuretics, both alpha- and beta-blocking drugs, calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Blood pressure control has been observed to be similar with moxonidine and these other agents. Generally, the overall incidence of side-effects has been found to be similar, although the incidence of side-effects with clonidine is greater than that seen with moxonidine.",

In this multicenter study, the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril added to continuing hydrochlorothiazide therapy were evaluated in patients with mild to moderate (stage I and II), essential hypertension. Two hundred fifty-two patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg to 114 mmHg were treated for 4 weeks with open-label hydrochlorothiazide at 25 mg/day. The 208 patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was > or = 90 mmHg at the end of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy entered a 12-week, double-blind treatment, where placebo or perindopril were added to the 25-mg/ day hydrochlorothiazide therapy as follows: placebo (n = 50) and doses of perindopril at 2 mg/day (n = 52), 4 mg/day (n = 53), and 8 mg/day (n = 53). The perindopril-hydrochlorothiazide combinations decreased both supine systolic blood pressure and supine diastolic blood pressure by 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg, for perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/day, respectively; there was no difference among the three drug groups. Placebo decreased blood pressure by 1.6/2.0 mmHg, an effect that was significantly lower compared with perindopril-hydrochlorothiazide combinations. Adverse events were mild and similar among all treatment groups, except cough, which was 4.0%, 3.9%, 7.6%, and 13.2% for placebo and perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively. The results of this multicenter study indicate that the combination of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide is safe and effective in lowering blood pressure. The findings also demonstrate that lower doses of perindopril are as effective as higher doses when combined with hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "296": "Congestive heart failure is a major public health problem in Western countries. Despite current treatment including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, mortality and morbidity remain high. The sympathetic nervous system is markedly activated in heart failure, and inhibition of this system with the beta-adrenergic blocking agents may provide further benefit. Several clinical trials involving over 3,000 patients have shown that beta-blocker therapy improves left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. However, the effects of such therapy on symptoms and exercise tolerance have been variable. Recent reports have suggested that survival is improved with the beta-blocker carvedilol. Large-scale, long-term clinical trials are required to confirm these findings and to clearly define the role of this promising therapy for patients with heart failure.", 
    "297": "Eight patients between the ages of 5 and 26 years developed a rapid decline of renal function with a period of oliguria or anuria which ranged between 1 and 21 days. The initial assessment of renal function revealed a severe degree of glomerular, tubular, and vascular abnormalities. The magnitude of the renal dysfunction was quantified and expressed in terms of a clinical score. The degree of glomerular and tubular dysfunction was inversely proportional to the renal plasma flow and peritubular capillary blood flow, respectively. Similar findings have been observed in a variety of other glomerulonephropathies where a relationship exists between the reduction of peritubular capillary blood flow and the severity of the tubulointerstitial disease. Evidence to support the position that the reduction of peritubular capillary blood flow plays a primary role in inducing tubulointerstitial disease is as follows: (i) A reduction of peritubular capillary blood flow has been documented in mesangial proliferative nephrosis with steroid resistance prior to the detection of tubulointerstitial disease. (ii) Ischemic insults are capable of inducing tubulointerstitial disease in the experimental setting of renal artery occlusion in animals. (iii) As demonstrated in the present report, an improvement of tubular function can be achieved following an increase in peritubular capillary blood flow with therapy designed to enhance renal perfusion.", 
    "298": "Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is one of the leading cause of the transplanted organ loss. In this experimental study, we investigated the effect of captopril on endothelin and eicosanoid release in I/R injury of the kidney. Rats were subjected to 60 min ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion of the left kidney in control and captopril groups. Tissue protein oxidation products, PGE2 and LTB4 levels and plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) like activity were determined in sham operated, control and captopril groups. There were no differences in the LTB4 levels among the groups. ET-1 and PGE2 levels and protein oxidation products increased in the control group when compared with the sham. Captopril further increased both PGE2 and ET-1 concentrations and prevented protein oxidation. The increased ET-1 concentrations in the captopril treated group may imply the protective role of endothelin as the significant increase in protein oxidation products was reversed by captopril infusion. This has led us to believe that captopril might be useful in preventing I/R injury of the kidney. Also the release of endothelin from the vascular endothelium is increased by captopril and may be mediated by PGE2.", 
    "299": "Neurohormonal activation is a pathogenic contributor and prognostic marker in congestive heart failure (CHF). While angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is now first-line therapy, sympathetic inhibition has only lately been proposed to this aim. Recently, we reported improvement of preload parameters by sympathetic suppression with clonidine. In the present paper we studied the effects of a single oral dose of clonidine 0.15 mg+captopril 6.25 mg combination, compared with captopril 6.15+placebo in a single-blind parallel study on 16 patients with Class III or IV CHF (13 males, 3 females, aged 62 +/- 8 years, with an ejection fraction of 33 +/- 8%). Hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were taken at baseline after a diagnostic cardiac catheterization and again 2 hours after treatment. The results indicate that preload parameters such as RAP, PCWP and MPAP decreased significantly with the combination therapy but not with captopril alone. On the contrary, SVR decreased significantly with both treatments and SVI increased significantly with both-but the latter change was significantly greater with the captopril/clonidine combination than with captopril alone. Suppression of plasma norepinephrine occurred with the combination only (evidently attributable to clonidine), whereas plasma renin activity increased with both regimens, due apparently to captopril. Our results indicate that the combination of clonidine with captopril induces significant improvements in both preload and afterload parameters of CHF and correction of activated neurohormones, suggesting additive hemodynamic and hormonal benefits from the two treatment modalities.", 
    "300": "Among the multiple mechanisms postulated for the increased risk of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), coronary hemodynamic alterations remain a strong possibility. This study was designed to compare the effects of treatment with an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) and an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan) on systemic and coronary hemodynamics and to determine whether the combination of these two renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor would be as or more effective in reducing mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular (LV) mass, and improving coronary hemodynamics than either regimen alone. Thus, 23 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated (12 weeks) with tap water (C), enalapril (30 mg.kg-1.d-1), losartan (30 mg.kg-1.d-1), or their combination (15 mg.kg-1.d-1). Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as normotensive controls. After 12 weeks, systemic and coronary hemodynamics were determined (15 microns radiolabeled microspheres) at baseline, during maximal treadmill exercise, and during maximal dilation (dipyridamole). Enalapril and losartan equally reduced MAP and LV mass in association with a decreased total peripheral resistance. The RAS combination reduced MAP and LV mass more than either drug alone. Resting cardiac index and coronary blood flow (CBF) per unit of LV mass did not differ among the groups. Although enalapril did not improve coronary flow reserve (CFR), it diminished minimal coronary vascular resistance (MCVR); losartan improved both. However, the combination was more effective than either agent alone, reaching values close to normotensive WKY controls. In conclusion, these data demonstrated significantly impaired maximal CBF, CFR, and MCVR in untreated SHR, but losartan alone and in combination with enalapril improved systemic and coronary hemodynamics more than enalapril alone.", 
    "301": "We investigated the mechanism of action of the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in cardiac capillary length density. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated prenatally and up to the age of 20 weeks with the ACE inhibitor ramipril (0.01 and 1 mg/kg per day PO) and the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (30 mg/kg per day PO). The contribution of endogenous bradykinin potentiation to the ACE inhibitor actions was assessed by cotreatment with the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Icatibant (0.5 mg/kg per day, SC via osmotic minipumps) from 6 to 20 weeks of age. At the end of the treatment period, cardiac capillary length density was measured stereologically using the orientator method. The development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy was prevented by high- but not low-dose ramipril and was not affected by chronic bradykinin B2-receptor blockade. Low- and high-dose ramipril significantly increased cardiac capillary length density (3577 +/- 279, n = 11 and 3988 +/- 300 mm/mm3; n = 10; P < .05) compared with vehicle-treated animals (2935 +/- 137 mm/mm3; n = 13). These effects were abolished by chronic bradykinin B2-receptor blockade. The bradykinin antagonist alone was without effect on cardiac capillary length density. Losartan prevented hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy but did not significantly alter cardiac capillary length density (3429 +/- 309 mm/mm3; n = 7). Our results demonstrate that chronic ACE inhibitor treatment can increase cardiac capillary length density in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats independently of a reduction in blood pressure or left ventricular hypertrophy. This effect is related to the ACE inhibitor-induced potentiation of endogenous bradykinin since it was prevented by chronic bradykinin B2-receptor blockade and was not observed following antihypertensive treatment with the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan.", 
    "302": "Recent studies have shown that angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] interacts with kinins and augments bradykinin (BK)-induced vasodilator responses by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we evaluated whether the potentiation of the BK-induced vasodilation by Ang-(1-7) may be attributable to inhibition of BK metabolism, release of nitric oxide, or both. Isometric tension was measured in intact canine coronary artery rings suspended in organ chambers. 125I-[Tyr0]-BK metabolism was determined in vascular rings by assessing the degradation of the peptide by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ang-(1-7) augmented the vasodilation induced by BK in a concentration-dependent manner in rings preconstricted with the thromboxane analog U46619. The EC50 of BK (2.45 +/- 0.51 nmol/L versus 0.37 +/- 0.08 nmol/L) was shifted leftward by 6.6-fold in the presence of 2 mumol/L concentration of Ang-(1-7). The response was specific for BK. since Ang-(1-7) did not augment the vasodilation induced by either acetylcholine (0.05 mumol/L) or sodium nitroprusside (0.1 mumol/L). Moreover, neither angiotensin I nor angiotensin II (Ang II) duplicated the augmented BK response of Ang-(1-7). Pretreatment of vascular rings with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA; 100 mumol/L) completely abolished the effects of Ang-(1-7) on BK-induced vasodilation whereas pretreatment with indomethacin (10 mumol/L) was without effect. The potent specific BK B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140. nearly abolished the BK and the Ang-(1-7) potentiated responses at 2 mumol/L, whereas at a lower concentration (20 nmol/L) Hoe 140 shifted the response curve to the right for both Ang-(1-7) and vehicle; however, the augmented response to Ang-(1-7) persisted. Preincubation of vascular rings with 20 mumol/L of the AT1 (CV11974), AT2 (PD123319), or nonselective (Sar1 Thr8-Ang II) receptor antagonists had no significant effect on the Ang-(1-7)-enhanced vasodilator response to BK. Lisinopril (2 mumol/L) significantly enhanced the BK-induced vasodilator response while at the same time it abolished the synergistic action of Ang-(1-7) on BK. In addition, pretreatment with 2 mumol/L Ang-(1-7) significantly inhibited the degradation of 125I-[Tyr0]-BK and the appearance of the BK-(1-7) and BK-(1-5) metabolites in coronary vascular rings. Ang-(1-7) inhibited purified canine angiotensin converting enzyme activity with an IC50 of 0.65 mumol/L. In conclusion. Ang-(1-7) acts as a local synergistic modulator of kinin-induced vasodilation by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme and releasing nitric oxide.", 
    "303": "Recent studies suggest that thromboxane (TX) mediates a significant component of angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced hypertension. However, there is little information to support the hypothesis that this relationship is important during chronic, physiological increases in ANG II, particularly while controlling for variation in endogenous ANG II levels induced by TX inhibition. This study tested that hypothesis in 27 chronically instrumented rats. After baseline measurements, suppression of endogenous TX was induced and maintained throughout the study in 13 rats by i.v. infusion of the TX synthesis inhibitor (TSI) U63557A: the other 14 rats received vehicle. Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not different between groups and was unchanged by TSI or vehicle. Continuous inhibition of ANG II production was then initiated in both groups of rats by i.v. infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril. ACEI reduced blood pressure similarly in vehicle and TSI rats, from 105 +/- 2 to 91 +/- 2 mm Hg and 103 +/- 1 to 89 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. ANG II was then infused at 5 ng.kg-1.min-1 i.v. for 7 days in six rats from each group to restore ANG II activity to baseline levels. This dose increased MAP to 103 +/- 2 and 101 +/- 1 mm Hg in vehicle and TSI rats, respectively, values not different from pre-ACEI levels. Seven TSI rats and eight vehicle rats received a higher dose of ANG II (20 ng.kg-1.min-1 i.v.). After 7 days, MAP was higher in vehicle than in TSI rats (143 +/- 5 versus 120 +/- 4 mm Hg). These results suggest that endogenous TX is an important determinant of MAP in ANG II hypertension but may have a diminished role in blood pressure regulation when ANG II is at normal and subnormal levels.", 
    "304": "Endothelial function is known to be impaired in essential hypertensive patients. In this study, we examined whether antihypertensive drugs improve forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia in 26 patients with essential hypertension (62 +/- 2 years) without diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Antihypertensive drugs were never given or were discontinued for at least 4 weeks before the study. Patients were treated with monotherapy of either temocapril (2 or 4 mg, n = 15) or amlodipine (2.5 or 5 mg, n = 11) for 6 months. Forearm blood flow was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Vasodilator response to the release of upper arm compression at 300 mm Hg for 5 minutes and to sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (0.3 mg) were assessed. Changes of forearm blood flow response to reactive hyperemia were significantly less in hypertensive patients (99 +/- 18%) than in age-matched normotensive control subjects (150 +/- 22%, P < .01, n = 39). Blood pressure (mm Hg) was similarly decreased by the treatment with temocapril (160 +/- 4/94 +/- 2 to 139 +/- 3/83 +/- 3, P < .001) or amlodipine (165 +/- 5/94 +/- 3 to 141 +/- 4/82 +/- 3, P < .001). Response to nitroglycerin was not changed by either drug. Forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia was improved by temocapril (102 +/- 20% to 168 +/- 25%, P < .01) but not by amlodipine (97 +/- 16% to 114 +/- 14%, NS). These results indicate that the treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor temocapril improved forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia, suggesting its beneficial effect on endothelial function.", 
    "305": "The adaptive changes that occur in the left ventricle (LV) and vessels in response to hypertension, namely, muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, endothelial dysfunction, and extracellular matrix increase, do not depend solely on blood pressure elevation. These changes are in fact, maladaptive since they are forerunners of cardiac failure, stroke, and renal failure. Nitric oxide, an endogenous vasodilator and inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle cell growth, is synthesized in the endothelium by constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS). We investigated the relationships among LV and aortic cNOS activity (conversion of [14C] L-arginine to [14C] L-citrulline), with LV hypertrophy (LV weight/body weight), and (2) aortic hypertrophy (aortic weight/ length) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats matched for blood pressure (219 +/- 12 versus 211 +/- 7 mm Hg, P = NS) and age. Compared with their normotensive counterparts, aortic cNOS activity was increased 106% in SHR but reduced by 73% in DS rats. The correlation between blood pressure and aortic cNOS activity was positive (r = .74, P < .01) in SHR and negative (r = -.82, P < .01) in DS rats, LV cNOS activity was increased 73% in SHR compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (P < .01). On the other hand, LV cNOS activity was not increased in hypertensive DS rats compared with normotensive DS rats. In SHR, aortic hypertrophy did not increase significantly and LV hypertrophy increased only 15%, whereas in hypertensive DS rats the aorta and LV hypertrophied 36% and 88%, respectively (both P < .01). Moreover, in DS rats there was a negative correlation between cNOS activity and aortic hypertrophy (r = -.70, P < .01). In DS rats, antihypertensive therapy consisting of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, and a diuretic, indapamide, normalized blood pressure, aortic cNOS activity, and LV hypertrophy and reduced aortic hypertrophy. Our studies imply that upregulation of vascular cNOS activity has a protective cardiovascular homeostatic role in hypertension. Clinically, the variable end-organ disease observed in individuals with similar severity of hypertension may be explained, at least in part, by genetically conditioned differences in vascular cNOS activity in response to hypertension.", 
    "306": "Renal vascular responses to angiotensin II (Ang II) and norepinephrine (NE) are reported to involve both mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores and activation of calcium influx pathways. The present study was conducted to determine the contribution of calcium release from intracellular stores to afferent and efferent arteriolar responses to Ang II and NE. Experiments were performed in vitro using the blood-perfused, juxtamedullary nephron technique combined with videomicroscopy. The responses of afferent and efferent arterioles to Ang II and NE were determined before and after depletion of intracellular calcium pools with 1 mumol/L thapsigargin. Positive control responses were obtained with 55 mmol/L KCI. Ang II concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 nmol/L decreased afferent arteriolar diameter by 10 +/- 4%, 17 +/- 4%, and 29 +/- 6%, respectively (P < .05; n = 8). NE also decreased afferent diameter by 5 +/- 1%, 13 +/- 1%, and 57 +/- 9% at concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 nmol/L, respectively (P < .05; n = 6). Thapsigargin treatment shifted the afferent arteriolar concentration-response curves for both Ang II and NE significantly to the right. Nevertheless, KCI evoked a pronounced vasoconstriction and decreased afferent diameter by 56 +/- 7% (P < .05; n = 6). Postglomerular responses to Ang II and NE were abolished by thapsigargin. During the control period, efferent diameter decreased by 3 +/- 1%, 7 +/- 2%, and 14 +/- 4% for the three Ang II concentrations and 3 +/- 1%, 5 +/- 1%, and 15 +/- 4% in response to the three NE concentrations, respectively. These responses were completely eliminated in the presence of thapsigargin, whereas KCI evoked an efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction of 57 +/- 9% (P < .05). These data demonstrate that agonist-induced calcium release from intracellular stores represents an essential component in the afferent and efferent arteriolar response to Ang II and NE. Furthermore, they suggest that efferent arteriolar responses to these agents may rely more heavily on calcium release from this store, whereas afferent responses may include activation of other pathways.", 
    "307": "Remarkable advances have been made with prolonged antihypertensive therapy in reversing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Deaths from stroke have been reduced by 70% and from coronary heart disease by 35%. In contrast, endstage renal disease resulting from hypertension continues to increase. The explanations for this seeming paradox remain unresolved even though experimental models have demonstrated that certain antihypertensive agents may have beneficial renal and intrarenal hemodynamic effects; but reversal of the intrarenal pathological lesions have not been shown to improve. This discussion summarizes recent studies from our laboratory in aged (73- and 85-week-old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with naturally occurring end-stage renal disease and in a model of aged SHR employing nitric oxide inhibition in younger, adult (20-week-old) SHR. Our findings demonstrated that the systemic and whole renal hemodynamics, intrarenal glomerular dynamics, proteinuria, and renal pathological lesions can be prevented or reversed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition therapy but not with hydrochlorothiazide (at similar levels of arterial pressure reduction). The implications and possible mechanisms involved in the development of both naturally occurring and nitric oxide-exacerbated SHR are multifactorial, involving the endothelial nitric oxide system and its interaction with angiotensin II (and possibly bradykinin) among other factors. Moreover, these pathophysiological cellular mechanisms may be shared by the aging process as well as in naturally occurring spontaneous hypertension in the rat and, perhaps, in humans with essential hypertension. Thus, antihypertensive therapy seems to be specific in its ability to prevent and even reverse the pathophysiological derangements of renal involvement in hypertension. Thus, prevention and reversal of end-stage renal disease do not seem to require greater reduction of arterial pressure than with other target-organ involvement. However, they do require specific inhibition of the arteriolar and glomerular lesions produced by the disease.", 
    "308": "We tested the hypothesis that changes in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene expression can regulate the rate of local vascular angiotensin II (Ang II) production. We perfused isolated rat hindlimbs with an artificial medium and infused renin and Ang I via the perfusate. Ang I and II were measured by radioimmunoassay. We then increased ACE gene expression and ACE levels in the rat aorta by producing two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) hypertension for 4 weeks. Gene expression was measured by RNAse protection assay, and ACE activity in the vessel wall was measured by the Cushman-Cheung assay. Angiotensin I infusion at 1, 10, 100, and 1000 pmol/mL led to 371 +/- 14 (+/-SEM), 3611 +/- 202, 44,828 +/- 1425, and 431,503 +/- 16,439 fmol/mL Ang II released, respectively, from the hindlimbs (r = .98, P < .001). Thus, the conversion rate did not change across four orders of magnitude, and the system was not saturable under these conditions. In 2K1C hindlimbs, Ang I infusion (0.5 pmol/mL) resulted in increased Ang II generation (157 +/- 16 versus 123 +/- 23 fmol/mL, P = .014 at minute 10) compared with controls. ACE gene expression and ACE activity were increased in 2K1C hindlimbs compared with controls (36 +/- 4 versus 17 +/- 1 mU/mg protein, P < .001). Ang II degradation in the two groups did not differ. To investigate the conversion of locally generated Ang I, we infused porcine renin (0.5 milliunits per mL) into 2K1C and control hindlimbs. Despite markedly higher Ang I release in sham-operated than in 2K1C rats (71 +/- 8 versus 37 +/- 6 pmol/mL, P = .008 at minute 12), Ang II was only moderately increased (36 +/- 3 versus 25 +/- 6 pmol/mL, P = .12 at minute 12). This difference between 2K1C rats and controls reflected a higher rate of conversion in 2K1C rats. Thus, Ang I conversion in the rat hindlimb is linear over a wide range of substrate concentrations and occurs at a fixed relationship. Nevertheless, increased ACE gene expression and ACE activity in the vessel wall lead to an increase in the conversion of Ang I to Ang II. We conclude that local ACE gene expression and ACE activity can influence the local rate of Ang II production.", 
    "309": "Recently, we reported that neonatal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in the rat produces irreversible abnormalities in renal histology associated with increased diuresis. In the present study, we assessed the long-term consequences of neonatal angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on renal function. Rats were injected with 10 mg.kg-1.d-1 enalapril or vehicle from day 3 to day 24 after birth. Urine concentrating ability, renal function, and renal histology were assessed in 16-week-old rats. There was a twofold increase in diuresis and water intake in enalapril-treated rats throughout the study course. Urine osmolality after 24 hours of water deprivation was 1008 +/- 108 and 2549 +/- 48 mOsm.kg-1 (P < .05) in enalapril- and vehicle-treated rats, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate (0.54 +/- 0.03 versus 0.75 +/- 0.06 mL.min-1x100 g body wt-1, P < .05) and effective renal plasma flow (1.76 +/- 0.09 versus 2.19 +/- 0.14 mL.min-1x100 g body wt-1, P < .05) were reduced in neonatally enalapril-treated versus control rats. Absolute and fractional urinary sodium excretion values were elevated (P < .05) in enalapril-treated rats. Semiquantitative assessment of renal histology demonstrated statistically significant degrees of papillary atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and inflammation, tubular atrophy and dilatation, and focal glomerulosclerosis in neonatally enalapril-treated rats. In conclusion, neonatal angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the rat produces irreversible alterations in renal function and morphology, demonstrating the importance of an intact renin-angiotensin system neonatally for normal renal development.", 
    "310": "Problems with sexual function have been a long-standing concern in the treatment of hypertension and may influence the choice of treatment regimens and decisions to discontinue drugs. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) provides an excellent opportunity for examination of sexual function and effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension because of the number of drug classes studied, the double-blind study design, and the long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women), aged 45 to 69 years, treated with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, alcohol reduction (for current drinkers), and increased physical activity. Sexual function was ascertained by physician interviews at baseline and annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported a problems with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems obtaining and/or maintaining an erection; 2.0% of women reported a problem having an orgasm. Erection problems in men at baseline were positively related to age, systolic pressure, and previous antihypertensive drug use. The incidences of erection dysfunction during follow-up in men were 9.5% and 14.7% through 24 and 48 months, respectively, and were related to type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erection problems through 24 months than participants randomized to placebo (17.1% versus 8.1%, P = .025). Incidence rates through 48 months were more similar among treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. Incidence was lowest in the doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group. Incidence for acebutolol, amlodipine, and enalapril groups was similar to that in the placebo group. In many cases, erection dysfunction did not require withdrawal of medication. Disappearance of erection problems among men with problems at baseline was common in all groups but greatest in the doxazosin group. Incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In conclusion, long-term incidence of erection problems in treated hypertensive men is relatively low but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. Effects of erection dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often tolerable, and new occurrences after 2 years are unlikely. The rate of reported sexual problems in hypertensive women is low and does not appear to differ by type of drug. Similar incidence rates of erection dysfunction in placebo and most active drug groups caution against routine attribution of erection problems to antihypertensive medication.",

Captopril was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.1 mg/g to CB3-infected mice daily on days 10-30 in experiment I (inflammatory phase) and on days 30-60 in experiment II (fibrotic phase). In experiment I, mouse survival was higher in the captopril-treated group than in the untreated group. Histological improvement, including prevention of extravasated fibrin deposition, maintenance of connective tissue architecture, suppression of myocyte hypertrophy, and prevention of myosin isoform shift from alpha to beta, was observed in captopril-treated mice in experiment I, but not in experiment II; in experiment II, captopril administration suppressed thickening of the interstitial reticulin fibers. Captopril inhibited inflammatory fibrin deposition, postmyocarditic myocyte hypertrophy, and ventricular remodeling during the inflammatory phase, but not during the fibrotic phase, of CB3 myocarditis in mice.",

The lowest dose of felodipine (F2.5) was the least effective. After 4 weeks the ABPM showed consistent 24-h reductions in blood pressure (4/2; 8/5; 7/5; 10/6 mmHg, respectively) over 24 h for the felodipine ER 5 mg group only and for both nifedipine groups. No statistically significant difference between these groups was found. An office responder does not appear to be identical to an ambulatory one and vice versa.

    "316": "The endothelium participates in the control of coronary vascular tone and growth through the release of vasodilating and growth-inhibiting factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and vasoconstricting and growth-promoting substances such as endothelin-1 (ET-1). Abnormalities in NO and/or CNP generation or actions have been demonstrated in various cardiovascular pathophysiological states, specifically atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. Moreover, an increase in plasma ET-1 levels has also been reported in these disease states. When these observations are considered together, these states may be characterised by an attenuated release or action of NO and/or CNP, together with an augmented release of ET-1. Thus, an imbalance between these opposing factors may contribute to the alteration in vascular tone and the vascular remodelling characteristics of cardiovascular disease. The following article summarises the present knowledge of endothelial control of the coronary circulation and derangements associated with coronary endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "317": "Endothelial dysfunction is emerging as an important factor in the early development of acute and chronic renal disease. Drugs aimed specifically at rectifying this aberration are being developed, although other established agents such as calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors also have beneficial effects in this setting. Calcium antagonists are particularly effective at ameliorating acute renal ischaemia associated with endothelial dysfunction. Combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor might optimise the beneficial effects of calcium channel blockade on the sequelae of endothelial dysfunction in chronic renal failure.", 
    "318": "Congestive Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome characterised by myocardial dysfunction and sympathetic activation. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels have been related to the poorest survival. Large-scale clinical trials have proved the clinical benefits of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors in reducing the risk of death and hospitalisation. However, mortality remains high in the treated group underlining the need to explore new therapeutic approaches. Specific activation of peripheral dopamine receptors exerts profound hemodynamic effects and neurohormonal control such as peripheral and renal vasodilation, diuresis and natriuresis and inhibition of NE release. Z1046, a mixed D1/D2-like agonist, reduces peripheral and renal vascular resistance increasing renal blood flow. In anaesthetised dogs the compound strongly reduces plasma NE without increasing plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone. The inhibition of NE could be the basis of Z1046 potent cardioprotective effect observed in a dog model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, in which the severity of ventricular arrhythmias was markedly reduced, resulting in higher survival. These findings suggest that chronic oral treatment with specific dopaminergic agonists is able to alleviate the hemodynamic burden on the myocardium, and to suppress the sympatho-adrenal activity.", 
    "319": "We examined the degradation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid protein (1-40) by soluble and synaptic membrane fractions from post mortem human and fresh rat brain using HPLC. Most of the activity at neutral pH was in the soluble fraction. The activity was thiol and metal dependent, with a similar inhibition profile to insulin-degrading enzyme. Immunoprecipitation of insulin-degrading enzyme from the human soluble fraction using a monoclonal antibody removed over 85% of the beta-amyloid protein degrading activity. Thus insulin-degrading enzyme is the main soluble beta-amyloid degrading enzyme at neutral pH in human brain. The highest beta-amyloid protein degrading activity in the soluble fractions occurred between pH 4-5, and this activity was inhibited by pepstatin, implicating an aspartyl protease. Synaptic membranes had much lower beta-amyloid protein degrading activity than the soluble fraction. EDTA (2mM) caused over 85% inhibition of the degrading activity but inhibitors of endopeptidases -24.11, -24.15, -24.16, angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidases, and carboxypeptidases had little or no effect.", 
    "320": "The aim of this study was to determine if treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRA) might decrease urinary albumin excretion and prevent glomerular enlargement and glomerulosclerosis in subtotal (5/6) nephrectomized rats. Morphometric image analysis of glomeruli was also performed in the subtotal nephrectomized rats. The nephrectomized rats were treated with ACEI (enalapril 100 mg/l), AIIRA (L-158,809 10 mg/l) or TRX (reserpine 5 mg/ l, hydralazine 80 mg/l, and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/l) and euthanized at 16 weeks after renal ablation. Treatments were started at 2 weeks (early treatment: Group I) or 8 weeks (later treatment: Group II) after the ablation. ACEI and AIIRA treatments were equally and significantly effective in limiting albuminuria and progression of glomerular sclerosis. TRX was also as effective in decreasing urinary albumin excretion and preserving the renal function as ACEI or AIIRA in Group I. The improvement of albuminuria, glomerular enlargement and sclerosis after these treatments in Group II was significantly less than that in Group I. It appears that the early treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist or reserpine, hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide (TRX) may prevent glomerular injury in human patients with renal hypertension.", 
    "321": "Plasma concentrations of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) are high in patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. The present study examined changes in plasma ANP and BNP concentrations during 1 year of monotherapy with enalapril in elderly hypertensive patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Eight elderly hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy were treated with enalapril for 1 year, during which time serial changes were recorded in LV mass index, LV systolic function, and plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP. Enalapril maintained systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the normal range for over 1 year. Treatment significantly reduced posterior wall thickness at 6 months, and more so at 1 year, and tended to reduce septal wall thickness and LV mass index at 1 year. LV ejection fraction was slightly but significantly increased at 1 year. Plasma ANP and BNP, which were markedly elevated at study entry, both decreased after 1 year of enalapril. These results suggest that 1 year of treatment with enalapril caused both a modest regression of LV hypertrophy and a modest improvement in LV systolic function in our selected group of elderly hypertensive patients. The drug reduced elevated plasma ANP and BNP levels but did not alter BUN and serum creatinine levels. Enalapril appears to be useful for the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy.", 
    "322": "We report the first case of the use of ibuprofen for the management of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. A 41 year-old man with nephrotic syndrome, secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, had persistent nephrotic range proteinuria despite aggressive treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide. His steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome resolved rapidly when he was serendipituously started on ibuprofen for the treatment of pericarditis. His proteinuria remained low at about 0.5 g/day over the next two years of treatment with ibuprofen and without any increase in his serum creatinine. He did not receive any ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker. An attempt to discontinue ibuprofen resulted in the relapse of his nephrotic syndrome. Upon restarting ibuprofen, his proteinuria decreased to less than 0.5 g/day again. We conclude that ibuprofen has been effective and safe for the management of nephrotic syndrome in this patient. However, careful monitoring is prudent to assess the potential adverse effects of ibuprofen on renal function with prolonged use.",

    "330": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate renal functional reserve [RFR is the difference between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at rest and maximal GFR after stimulation] in a controlled study in normal pigs. Our basic hypothesis was that a decreased RFR may be used as an early indicator of renal deterioration, i.e. a test to disclose significant obstruction as opposed to simple dilatation in hydronephrosis. During various forms of stimulation (amino acids, captopril and dopamine), we measured changes in GFR, renal plasma flow (RPF), tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, net uptake from plasma to the kidney of three salt and water homeostatic hormones (angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide) and of glucagon, which is thought to play a key role as mediator of the GFR increase during amino acid infusion. We found the largest GFR increase during combined infusion of amino acids and dopamine (+13%), but compared with a non-stimulated control group, the GFR increase was statistically non-significant. RPF increased by 57% during stimulation with amino acids plus dopamine (P < 0.001), while tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, and renal uptake of angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide showed no significant differences between control and stimulation groups. The renal uptake of glucagon increased significantly during amino acid stimulation with no concomitant GFR increase. We conclude that in this experimental, non-obstructed model, RFR is a very insensitive measure, which cannot be used to discriminate between obstruction and simple dilatation in hydronephrosis. Further, our study does not support the hypothesis that glucagon is involved in GFR changes after amino acids.", 
    "331": "During bone resorption, osteoclasts are closely associated with endothelial cells. The latter are able to produce several agents that regulate bone resorption. In view of the increasing evidence that angiotensin II, which can be generated by endothelial cells, has actions outside the traditional renin-angiotensin system, we tested the effect of angiotensin II on bone resorption Angiotensin II showed no effect either on osteoclast formation or on bone resorption by isolated osteoclasts. However, in co-cultures of osteoclasts with calvarial or MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, and in osteoclastic cultures co-cultured with other bone cells obtained by prolonged sedimentation, angiotensin II stimulated bone resorption to a similar degree to that observed with 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. Stimulation of resorption was noted at concentrations of 10(-7) M and above. We found that angiotensin I also stimulated bone resorption in co-cultures of osteoclasts with osteoblastic cells, and that this action was inhibited by inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. These results identify angiotensin I and II as potent stimulators of osteoclastic bone resorption, and raise the possibility that bone might contain a tissue-renin-angiotensin system that might play a role in the regulation of bone resorption.", 
    "332": "Two carboxylesterases with pI 6.0 and 6.2 derived from rat liver microsomes were purified. The two isozymes were remarkably different in substrate specificity, but they had equal enzymatic activity for alpha-naphthyl acetate and were inhibited equally by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and bis-(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP). Carboxylesterases pI 6.0 and 6.2 are identical to the enzymes referred to as hydrolase A and B, respectively, from the results of amino acid sequence analyses. Pranlukast was effectively hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase pI 6.2 but not by the pI 6.0 enzyme, and the difference in the pranlukast metabolism between the human and the rat could be explained by the substrate specificity of carboxylesterase. Furthermore, prodrugs of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were found to be converted to the active drugs after hydrolysis by the carboxylesterases pI 6.0 and 6.2. Carboxylesterases generally catalyze the hydrolysis of ester-type drugs preferentially rather than amide-type drugs.", 
    "333": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of nonpeptide angiotensin antagonists in humans are reviewed in this paper. Representatives of this new therapeutic class share common features: lipophilia, intermediate bioavailability, high affinity for plasma proteins and liver metabolism; some have active metabolites. Angiotensin II antagonists block the blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin II in healthy volunteers, decrease baseline blood pressure in both normal and hypertensive patients, produce a marked rise in plasma renin activity and endogenous angiotensin II and increase renal blood flow without altering glomerular filtration rate. These effects are dose-dependent, but their time course varies between the drugs owing to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences. Additionally, the extent of blood pressure reduction is dependent on physiological factors such as sodium and water balance. The characterisation of their pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships deserves further refinement for designing optimal therapeutic regimens and proposing dosage adaptations in specific conditions.", 
    "334": "To assess the mechanism of the effect of cigarette smoke on ulcer disease we employed a rat model in which cigarette smoke increases the size of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer and decreases the hyperemia at the ulcer margin. We postulate that cigarette smoke increases angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) in ulcer tissue. Since direct measurement of angiotensin II in small tissue samples is problematic, we compared the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for its precursors (angiotensinogen and renin) in ulcer and normal gastric tissue. We also evaluated the effect of enalapril, which blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II on ulcer size. In the ulcer tissue, cigarette smoke produced a significant increase in mRNA for angiotensinogen but not for renin. Enalapril decreased the size of the gastric ulcer in rats exposed to cigarette smoke. The data support the possibility that in ulcer tissue cigarette smoke stimulates an angiotensin II-mediated mechanism, which may in part be responsible for the impairment of ulcer margin hyperemia and aggravation of ulcer size.", 
    "335": "The goals of therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF) are to improve quality of life and to prolong it. Improvement in patients with CHF can only be realized, however, if a multidisciplinary healthcare team can provide effective management in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Inhibition of compensatory mechanisms that perpetuate CHF is the first step in achieving treatment goals. Combination therapy with diuretics, digoxin (Lanoxicaps, Lanoxin), and vasodilators is used for patients with symptomatic heart failure and volume overload. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve survival rates more than other vasodilators, they are preferred in patients with systolic dysfunction.", 
    "336": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) with normal left ventricular systolic function and abnormal diastolic performance is a common clinical entity. Typically, signs and symptoms are indistinguishable from those of heart failure related to systolic dysfunction. Coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, and aging are all associated with diastolic CHF. Diagnosis depends on a clinical suspicion of heart failure, followed by assessment of left ventricular systolic performance, which is normal in this condition. Ventricular diastolic performance can be assessed by noninvasive procedures, the most reliable and easily performed of which is echocardiography. General guidelines include searching for precipitants such as ischemia, tachycardia, and loss of atrial-ventricular synchrony. Treatment includes judicious use of nitrates and diuretics to relieve pulmonary congestion. There is no specific therapy to improve left ventricular diastolic function directly. However, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers are beneficial, and there is growing evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may prove valuable.", 
    "337": "The objectives of this study were (i) to determine whether the reduced absorption of captopril from the colon of humans also occurs in rats and (ii), after confirmation of the relevance of a new rat model, to evaluate the intestinal absorption of captopril and several of its analogs. A model was developed and validated in which specific sites within the GI tract of rats were surgically implanted with a cannula such that animals could be dosed while conscious and unrestrained. The absorption of captopril after administration into the lower GI tract of rats was significantly reduced relative to the upper GI tract, which was consistent with results reported previously in humans. In rats, the absorption of the S-benzoyl thioester prodrug of captopril (SQ-25868) from the lower GI tract was substantially greater than that of captopril. However, the absorption of the S-benzoyl thioester prodrug of 4-phenyl thio-captopril (SQ-26991) from the lower GI tract was only marginally better than that of captopril. In additional studies in dogs, a 12h controlled-release formulation of SQ-25868 provided sustained blood levels of captopril while maintaining acceptable bioavailability (> 80%). Two approaches were tried, without success, to stabilize captopril in vivo: (i) complexation with zinc (SQ-26284) and (ii) use of ascorbic-acid-buffered (pH 3.5) vehicle. The zinc complex might have failed because it has very low solubility, whereas the pH-3.5-buffered vehicle was quickly neutralized within the colonic lumen in rats, and did not stabilize captopril against oxidation. Rapid neutralization might explain why the colonic bioavailability of captopril was not substantially increased when this pH-3.5-buffered vehicle was tried in humans.", 
    "338": "The combination of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and thiazide diuretic has advantages over monotherapy for the treatment of hypertension. Previous study designs have often been inadequate to demonstrate the details of interactions between these antihypertensive agents. This study used a modified 4 x 4 factorial randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design to study the efficacy of 17 different doses of fosinopril (Fos), a phosphinic acid derived ACE inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 550 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Data from these variables were fit to quadratic response surface models (QRSM) using polynomial functions in the doses of the two components. Using QRSM, seated systolic (SeSBP) and diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) responses at 8 weeks were predicted for actual doses and interpolated for intermediate doses not studied. Fos and HCTZ alone and in combination produced a dose-related reduction in SeSBP and SeDBP. Using 10 mg Fos + 12.5 mg HCTZ reduced the adjusted mean SeDBP 6.3 mm Hg and 20 mg Fos + 12.5 mg HCTZ lowered the same measure 9.1 mm Hg. Coadministration of Fos and HCTZ produced an additive antihypertensive effect. This study of combination agents for hypertension using a factorial design with QRSM accurately predicts dose responses and is a valuable clinical trial methodology.", 
    "339": "In this study, we investigated whether antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril modifies Na+/H+ exchanger activity or NHE-1 (isoform of the exchanger) mRNA expression in lymphocytes from patients with essential hypertension. Thirty-three hypertensive patients and 27 normotensive subjects were studied. Maximal sodium-proton exchange activity was determined by acidifying cell pH and measuring the initial rate of the net sodium-dependent proton efflux driven by an outward proton gradient. The transcript level of NHE-1 was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in comparison with a constitutively expressed reference gene (beta-actin). With the 100% confidence (upper) limit of the normotensive population as a cutoff point, a subgroup of 11 hypertensive patients had an abnormally high lymphocyte Na+/H+ exchange activity (group A). The activity of the exchanger was within the normal range in the remaining patients (group B). After 6 months of quinapril treatment the activity of the exchanger decreased to normal values (P < .001) in patients from group A, but remained unchanged in patients from group B. The NHE-1 mRNA expression was not modified with treatment neither in patients from the group A, nor in patients from the group B. These results suggest that chronic angiotensin enzyme inhibition with quinapril abolishes Na+/H+ exchange overactivity present in lymphocytes from a subgroup of hypertensive patients. This effect appears to be independent of changes in the expression of the mRNA encoding for the NHE-1 isoform of the exchanger.", 
    "340": "Hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and fibrinogen are risk factors for atherosclerosis. We investigated the effect of reducing blood pressure, by blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), on the accumulation of these atherogenic proteins in arterial walls and other tissues in conscious, unrestrained, normotensive and hypertensive rats. The accumulation of LDL and fibrinogen, labeled respectively with 125I and 131I via the adduct tyramine cellobiose ([125I]-TC-LDL and [131I]-TC-fibrinogen) was compared in aortic walls, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and adrenal gland during the final 24 h of treatment with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril or the angiotensin II-receptor I (AT1) antagonist losartan. In normotensive rats, the blood pressure was decreased only by losartan. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), the blood pressure was decreased by both losartan and captopril. Captopril had no significant effect on the accumulation of LDL or fibrinogen by the aortic wall. Losartan significantly increased the accumulation of LDL by the aortic wall of SHRs. Neither agent produced any change in LDL or fibrinogen accumulation in any of the other tissues. These results indicate that although blocking the RAS at either the enzymic or receptor level produces significant decrease of blood pressure in hypertensive animals, only losartan has any affect on LDL accumulation by the aortic wall.", 
    "341": "Poor compliance may be responsible for symptomatic decompensation or neurohormonal \"escape\" in patients with heart failure treated over the long term with angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACEI) drugs. Serum ACE activity is a poor index of neurohormonal suppression or haemodynamic effect after ACE-inhibitor treatment. Serum ACE activity may, however, be a useful index of compliance with treatment, as serum ACE is sensitive to the presence of an ACE inhibitor in the blood. Sixteen normotensive male volunteers of known ACE genotype received 7 days of randomised, double-blind therapy on four occasions 2 weeks apart with lisinopril 20 mg (L) or matched placebo (P) to simulate (A) noncompliance (all P), (B) full compliance (all L), (C) partial compliance (L days, 1, 3, 6; P days, 2, 4, 5, 7), or (D) single dose (L day 7; P, 1-6). Supine (30 min) blood pressure (BP)/heart rate (HR), ACE, and angiotensins were measured on d7 before dose and 4-6 h after dose. Results are mean +/- 1 SD. BP showed the expected small decrease with active treatment on d7 (B or D) but not with placebo (A) or partial compliance (C). Prestudy serum ACE, despite a wide range (16-124 U/L), was reproducible within subjects [coefficient of variation (CV), 1.7%]. Serum ACE activity, before (41.9 +/- 30) and after (41 +/- 30) angiotensin (A) I or II, were unaffected by treatment (placebo A). Active treatment (B) resulted in very low serum ACE activity and d7 and a small further suppression after dosing (before, 3.9 +/- 4; after, 1.8 +/- 4). AI was elevated in this group with further elevation after dosing (before, 234 +/- 116; after, 551 +/- 250). AII was only modestly reduced from baseline and showed little further suppression after dosing (before, 7.8 +/- 4; after, 6.3 +/- 5). Partial compliance (C) showed low ACE but no reduction after treatment (before, 7 +/- 3; after, 7 +/- 4), an elevated AI but no dosing effect (before, 187 +/- 198; after, 200 +/- 151) and reduced AII but with no further dose suppression (before, 6.4 +/- 3.4; after, 7 +/- 4) induced increase in peptide (compared with B). Single-dose treatment (D) showed ACE inhibition as expected (before, 47 +/- 30; after, 2.2 +/- 3). There was a dosing-related increase of AI but to a lesser extent than seen with chronic active dosing (B) (before, 39 +/- 10; after, 240 +/- 200). In contrast to long-term dosing, there was marked ANG II suppression (before, 8.8 +/- 4; after, 2.9 +/- 3). With this long-acting ACEI in a dose relevant to congestive heart failure management, we suggest that 4-6 h after-dosing serum ACE (< 5 EU/L) and elevated ANG I (> 300 pg/ml) can be used to confirm compliance with treatment. These absolute values may be altered in patients treated concomitant with loop diuretics. In principle, however, this may be a useful tool in clinical trials or in clinical practice after further work has been done to assess the limits in patients across the doses and across the range of available drugs used.", 
    "342": "The introduction of agents that block the renin-angiotensin system has provided major benefit to patients with hypertension, renal diseases, and congestive heart failure. Some of the therapeutic advantages related to the kidney derive from removing angiotensin II at the efferent arteriole. Under some circumstances when afferent blood supply is compromised, particularly beyond a renal arterial stenosis, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can lead to decrements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and impaired potassium excretion, which clinicians should be prepared to identify and manage. How often this occurs and when such a decrement poses a hazard to renal parenchymal viability depends on the starting conditions of the renal vasculature and sodium balance. Although these observations have been made primarily with ACE inhibitors, the basic principles apply to other agents interacting with components of the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin II antagonists and renin-inhibitors. When promptly identified and treated, changes in kidney function under these conditions represent a modest and acceptable risk worth taking in exchange for major therapeutic benefits.", 
    "343": "Larval Ambystoma tigrinum were cannulated nonocclusively in the truncus arteriosus and allowed to recover for 20-24 hr. In one group of animals a peritoneal cannula was inserted in order to induce acidosis through the injection of lactic acid (2 micromol/g). Immediately following a control blood sample (hr 0), lactic acid was injected, and blood samples were collected at 1, 4, 8, and 24 hr and analyzed for pH, PCO2, PO2, [HCO3-], and aldosterone. These animals exhibited a significant metabolic acidosis, which was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma aldosterone, and recovered in approximately 24 hr. Additional groups of animals were subjected to the same acidosis and also received either saralasin (0.01 or 1 microg/g at 0, 1, and 4 hr) or captopril (0.01-0.1 or 1 microg/g at 0, 1, and 4 hr). The groups of animals whose renin-angiotensin system was blocked by saralasin or captopril did not show a significant change in their ability to recover from the metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, saralasin and captopril were ineffective in inhibiting the normal rise in circulating aldosterone in response to acidosis. In another group of animals, synthetic human angiotensin II (1 microg/g; Ang II) was infused immediately following the control blood sample (hr 0) and blood samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hr and assayed for aldosterone. Plasma aldosterone levels increased significantly from 133 +/- 91 pg/ml at hr 0 to a maximum of 3288 +/- 519 pg/ml at hr 4. Sham-treated animals did not increase circulating aldosterone. When Ang II (1 microg/g) and saralasin (1 microg/g) were given simultaneously, however, the rise in plasma aldosterone was only about 35% that of animals which received Ang II alone. We conclude that administration of Ang II leads, either directly or indirectly, to synthesis and release of aldosterone from the interrenal tissues of larval Ambystoma tigrinum and that this rise can be significantly attenuated by saralasin. We furthermore conclude that although the renin-angiotensin system may be indirectly involved in recovery from an acid challenge, it does not appear to be the stimulus for the observed increase in plasma aldosterone in response to acidosis in these animals.",

We found that i.v. pretreatment with phentolamine had no effect on the tachycardia elicited by DAMGO (1 nmol); however, the pressor response was reversed to a state of hypotension, the renal and superior mesenteric vasoconstrictions were attenuated and the hindquarter vasodilation was potentiated. In the presence of propranolol, the pressor response and renal vasoconstriction were unchanged, whereas the superior mesenteric vasoconstriction was reduced and the hindquarter vasodilation was abolished. Moreover, in those animals we observed bradycardia followed by tachycardia. Combined i.v. pretreatment with phentolamine and propranolol abolished the pressor and heart rate responses to DAMGO but had no effect on the renal and superior mesenteric vasoconstrictions, although the hindquarter vasodilation was reduced. Intravenous pretreatment with a vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist or captopril had no effect on the cardiovascular responses to DAMGO. Together, these results indicate that the hypertension observed after injection of DAMGO into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus was secondary to alpha adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictions in renal and superior mesenteric vascular beds and to beta adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in the hindquarter vascular bed, whereas the involvement of circulating vasopressin or angiotensin seems less obvious from the present findings. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that nonadrenergic, nonvasopressinergic and nonangiotensinergic vasoconstrictor mechanisms were acting in the renal and superior mesenteric vascular beds.", 
    "350": "Three patients with acute pancreatitis diagnosed while they were taking enalapril are described. In two of these patients, enalapril was the only drug taken immediately before the symptoms began, and other etiologies were accurately excluded. In the third patient, the relationship between enalapril and acute pancreatitis was shown by a rechallenge with the drug that resulted in severe acute pancreatitis. This report is a definite demonstration of the relationship between enalapril and acute pancreatitis. We suggest stopping treatment with enalapril in patients suspected of having acute pancreatitis. We also recommend not rechallenging patients with the drug because of the risk of inducing severe acute pancreatitis.", 
    "351": "We examined the potential of in vivo linkage of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II) in the setting of endothelial injury and sclerosis following radiation injury in the rat. PAI-1 is a major physiological inhibitor of the plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin system, a key regulator of fibrinolysis and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. PAI-1 mRNA expression in the kidney was markedly increased (9-fold) at 12 weeks after irradiation (P < 1.001 vs. normal control). In situ hybridization revealed significant association of PAI-1 expression with sites of glomerular injury (signal intensity in injured vs. intact glomeruli, P < 0.001). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI, captopril or enalapril) or angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIRA, L158,809) markedly reduced glomerular lesions (thrombosis, mesangiolysis, and sclerosis; sclerosis index, 0 to 4+ scale, 0.49 +/- 0.20 in untreated vs. 0.05 +/- 0.02, 0.02 +/- 0.01, 0.04 +/- 0.02 in captopril, enalapril and AIIRA, respectively, all P < 0.01 vs untreated). Further, ACEI and AIIRA markedly attenuated increased PAI-1 mRNA expression in the irradiated kidney (36, 19 and 20% expression, respectively, for captopril, enalapril and AIIRA, compared to untreated irradiated kidney, P < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.01). This effect was selective in that neither tissue-type nor urokinase-type PA mRNA expression was affected by these interventions. Thus, we speculate that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may ameliorate injury following radiation by accelerating fibrinolysis and ECM degradation, at least in part, via suppression of PAI-1 expression. In summary, inhibition of Ang II, in addition to its known effects on vascular sclerosis, may also by its novel effect to inhibit PAI-1, lessen fibrosis following endothelial/thrombotic injury.", 
    "352": "The roles of elevated cell sodium concentrations and the angiotensin-aldosterone system (AAS) in the structural and functional adaptation of the distal tubule and collecting duct system to a chronic increase of sodium delivery were examined using electron microprobe and quantitative morphologic/stereologic analyses. Studies were performed on rats given the loop diuretic torasemide acutely (20 min) or chronically (12 days), either alone or in combination with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril. In the sodium-absorbing cells of the distal tubule and cortical collecting duct-that is, in distal convoluted tubule (DCT), connecting tubule (CNT) and principal cells-an acute increase in sodium delivery caused a significant rise in intracellular sodium concentration and rubidium uptake, the latter an index of in vivo Na,K(Rb)-ATPase activity. The elevated cell sodium concentrations returned to, or close to, control values during chronic torasemide treatment. Intracellular rubidium concentrations, measured after a 30-second rubidium exposure, were not different from controls in DCT and CNT cells but were still higher in principal cells. Since, however, the distribution space for rubidium was significantly increased in chronic torasemide animals, rubidium uptake, and hence Na,K-ATPase activity, must have increased in proportion to cell volume in DCT and CNT cells, but more than proportionately in principal cells. When ACE was inhibited during chronic torasemide, the epithelial volume of DCT and cortical collecting duct (CCD) was increased mainly by lengthening and not, as was the case in rats given torasemide alone, by thickening of the tubule wall. Adaptation of the proximal tubule exclusively by lengthening was not affected by inhibition of the ACE. These data indicate that changes in cell ion composition may participate in initiating cell processes leading to adaptation of distal nephron segments to chronically increased salt delivery. Inhibition of the ACE reverses the torasemide-induced increase in apparent Na pump density in principal cells and seems to shift the relationship between hypertrophy and hyperplasia noted in DCT and CCD after chronic torasemide in favor of hyperplasia.", 
    "353": "The renin-angiotensin system regulates blood pressure and sodium homeostasis through a series of coordinated substrate-enzyme interactions. These interactions result in the production of angiotensin II (AII), which exerts a number of diverse biologic effects mediated through AII cell-surface receptors. Dysregulation of this system is implicated in the pathogenesis of various forms of hypertension. Traditional therapy for hypertension has included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which block the production of AII. However, a new class of drugs, AT1-receptor blockers, now offers a number of benefits by specifically blocking the effects of AII at its physiologically relevant receptor.", 
    "354": "The kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) has been postulated to play a role in modulation of hemodynamic function in diabetes and to contribute to the hemodynamic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (CEI). To further explore the KKS and its interactions with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), studies were conducted in nondiabetic control rats and in moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats. In protocol 1, control and diabetic rats were studied before and after administration of one of two dissimilar B2 kinin receptor antagonists (BK2As), or vehicle. At a low dose (0.5 microg x kg-1 x min-1), the first generation antagonist D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin significantly reduced the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow rate in diabetic rats, despite variable effectiveness in blocking the hypotensive response to injected bradykinin. However, a similar hemodynamic effect occurred in nondiabetic rats, suggesting that the observed effect was not specific to diabetes. Higher doses (20 microg bolus, then 1 microg x kg-1 x min-1 infusion) did not affect hemodynamics in either group, perhaps because of partial agonist effect. The second BK2A tested was the newer compound, icatibant (Hoe 140; D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-bradykinin). Hoe 140 consistently blocked the vasodepressor action of injected bradykinin, but had no effect on systemic or renal hemodynamics in either control or diabetic rats. In protocol 2, control and diabetic rats were pretreated with the CEI ramipril for 1-2 weeks, after which renal function was studied before and after Hoe 140 (0.1 mg s.c. and i.v.) or vehicle. CEI lowered blood pressure in both groups. Hoe 140 did not affect renal function in control rats, but in diabetic rats pretreated with ramipril, it induced a modest but significant decline in GFR. Ramipril induced the predicted changes in the systemic and intrarenal RAS, while acute BK2A had no consistent effect on RAS parameters. These studies suggest that the endogenous KKS has only a minor role in modulation of renal hemodynamics in the euvolemic diabetic rat, in the absence of KKS stimulation by CEI. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme is also kininase II, which serves to increase endogenous kinin activity. The increased kinin activity resulting from CEI treatment may participate, to a modest degree, in hemodynamic regulation of the diabetic kidney.", 
    "355": "To evaluate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on spontaneous and insulin-stimulated endothelin-1 (ET-1) secretion in vitro and in vivo, human endothelial cells derived from umbilical cord veins were cultured onto acellular collagen-coated permeable membrane, thus mimicking in vivo conditions with a luminal and abluminal side. Insulin (10(-6,-8,-9) mol/l) significantly stimulated ET-1 secretion by cultured cells (P < 0.05 starting from 2-h incubation). Captopril (10(-7,-8,-9) mol/l) significantly reduced both spontaneous and insulin-stimulated ET-1 secretion, while increasing nitric oxide production. Considering each cell side, captopril significantly inhibited the apical secretion of ET-1, while its effect on the basolateral compartment was modest. In the presence of D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin (10(-6) mol/l), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, captopril had no effects on ET-1 and nitric oxide production and also when insulin was added to the culture media. With regard to in vivo experiments, oral captopril therapy (25 mg twice daily for 1 week) was given to normotensive (n = 5) and hypertensive (n = 6) subjects and significantly decreased plasma ET-1 concentration (normotensive subjects, before: 0.98 +/- 0.09 pg/ml; after: 0.55 +/- 0.08 pg/ml, P < 0.0001; hypertensive subjects, before: 1.05 +/- 0.03 pg/ml; after: 0.56 +/- 0.05 pg/ml, P < 0.0001). Transient hyperinsulinemia was accompanied by a significant rise in plasma ET-1 concentrations in both groups (P < 0.0001 at 180 and 210 min) before but not after captopril treatment. In conclusion, captopril inhibits both spontaneous and insulin-stimulated ET-1 secretion by endothelial cells, acting on angiotensin-converting enzyme bound to the luminal cell side. In vivo, captopril significantly reduces plasma ET-1 levels in both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions.", 
    "356": "The effects of enalapril on exercise capacity and neurohumoral factors during exercise were evaluated in 10 patients with heart failure. Echocardiograms and exercise testing with expired gas analysis were performed before and after enalapril. Blood samples were obtained before and after exercise. Both ejection fraction and percent fractional shortening increased with enalapril (p < 0.05). The anaerobic threshold and peak VO2 did not change with enalapril. Epinephrine and norepinephrine levels at peak exercise decreased with enalapril (p < 0.1). Plasma renin both at rest and at peak exercise increased with enalapril (p < 0.1). Angiotensin II was lower after enalapril both at rest and at peak exercise (p < 0.1 and p < 0.05, respectively). Aldosterone was lower after enalapril both at rest and at peak exercise (p < 0.05). Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was lower after enalapril both at rest and at peak exercise. There was no significant correlations between peak VO2 and changes in neurohumoral factors before and after enalapril during exercise. In conclusion, neurohumoral changes with enalapril occurred during exercise even if exercise capacity did not improve. Moreover, the improvement of cardiac function at rest and neurohumoral factors with enalapril did not lead to a change of exercise capacity.", 
    "357": "In patients with congestive cardiac failure, treatment with ACE inhibitors results in peripheral vasodilatation and an increase in cardiac output without an increase in heart rate, which suggests a positive inotropic effect. This cannot be explained by the changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin concentrations that occur. It has been suggested that ACE also metabolizes VIP, which is a positive inotrope. As VIP is synthetized by the heart and acts locally to increase cardiac output, we postulated that ACE inhibition would increase the myocardial concentration of VIP. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received enalapril (2 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water or no therapy for seven days. On day seven they were anaesthetized and blood sampled. The hearts and kidneys were then harvested and snap frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Concentrations of VIP in plasma and tissue extracts were measured by radioimmunoassay. Plasma and renal concentrations of VIP did not change in the enalapril-treated rats. However, the myocardial concentration of VIP increased significantly in the rats receiving enalapril compared with control animals (p < 0.0005). We conclude that treatment with ACE inhibitors results in increased myocardial VIP concentrations and suggest that this may contribute to the improvement in cardiac function that occurs with these agents.", 
    "358": "Authors performed a comparative study of replacement of captopril (2-3x daily) therapy with once daily enalapril. Blood pressure was measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. The study enrolled 62 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Captopril was previously administered 2-4 times per day, in mean dose of 74.4 mg, for 3.2 years as an average. After a 4 x 4 weeks study period the final enalapril dose was 15 mg, once in the morning. Enalapril was administered as monotherapy in 36 cases. During the trial mean blood pressure decreased from 140 +/- 14/85 +/- 9 mmHg to 125 +/- 12/76 +/- 7 mmHg (p < 0.01), diurnal index increased from 12/10% to 15/11%. Enalapril treatment lowered daytime percent time elevation index (PTI) from 56 +/- 30% to 27 +/- 23% (p < 0.05), nighttime PTI from 64 +/- 34% to 37 +/- 35% (p < 0.05), and hyperbaric impact values from 183 +/- 152 mmHg x hour to 97 +/- 128 mmHg x hour (p < 0.01). Adverse effects of both drugs were rare and mild, enalapril caused no changes in overall quality of life. Improvement of antihypertensive efficacy after a switch to enalapril treatment could be related to better compliance achieved by once-daily dose, and tight out-patient blood pressure control. The authors concluded that after a 16 weeks of therapy, once-daily enalapril administration was more effective and compliant in reducing blood pressure, than 2-4 times per day captopril treatment, when measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.",

    "360": "After a pre-inclusion period, 147 eligible subjects (64 men and 83 women, age range 32-74 years) were randomized into two groups and given, in a double-blind trial, either captopril (50 mg/d) or atenolol (50 mg/d) for 6 months. The controlled trial was followed by an open trial in 120 subjects for 6 more months. Laboratory tests for lipid metabolism were performed at inclusion and at 6 months.", 
    "361": "Control of blood pressure was satisfactory and similar in the two groups. Lipid tests were performed both in local and a centralized laboratory with good interlaboratory correlations. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol remained unchanged in the captopril group declined slightly in the atenolol group. Total cholesterol increased moderately in both groups. Triglycerides increased somewhat in the captopril group and significantly more in the atenolol group. These results were maintained during the open trial. Most of the undesirable effects were benign and did not require treatment.",

    "363": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the haemodynamic changes induced by acute administration of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester in anaesthetised dogs was investigated. The left femoral artery and vein were cannulated for blood pressure measurement and drug administration, respectively. A Swan-Ganz catheter was introduced through the right femoral vein and advanced to the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary arterial pressure, right atrial pressure and cardiac output were also determined. N omega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (0.01-10.0 mg/kg) was administered alone (control animals, n = 18) or in the presence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril (2 mg/kg, n = 9) or enalapril (2 mg/kg, n = 7) or of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist D-[Arg-Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8]bradykinin (Hoe 140, 0.1 mg/kg, n = 6). Cerebellum nitric oxide synthase and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activities were also measured. N omega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester induced dose-dependent increases in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and decreases in heart rate and cardiac output. Nitric oxide synthase activity was inhibited 58% by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (from 3.37 +/- 0.30 to 1.40 +/- 0.24 pmol/min per mg protein, P < 0.05, n = 5). Both enalapril and captopril potentiated the cardiovascular changes induced by bradykinin (300 ng/kg, bolus). Moreover, enalapril inhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity from 12.8 +/- 1.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 nmol/ml per min (P < 0.05, n = 6). Under these conditions, N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester administration elicited the same haemodynamic changes as those observed in non-treated animals, except for preventing the decrease in systolic index. Hoe 140 had no effect on the cardiovascular responses to N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. These results indicate that the renin-angiotensin system does not modulate these haemodynamic changes.", 
    "364": "In the era of multiple new therapies (e.g., aspirin, beta blockers, thrombolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, etc.) with the potential to improve outcome, the utility of traditional methods for predicting risk for adverse outcome after acute myocardial infarction (MI) is being reevaluated. Recent data suggest that heart failure, male gender, older age, and ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring are the best predictors for increased risk of death or nonfatal MI. Exercise stress testing and ejection fraction determination provide little, if any, additional prognostic information. A new, highly promising strategy is to assess the degree of resolution in ST-segment elevation on repeated ECG monitoring following thrombolytic therapy. Studies have shown that failure to achieve prespecified degrees of ST-segment resolution within the first few hours of thrombolytic therapy is a reliable indicator of risk for post-MI mortality. Emerging data are also raising the possibility that cardiac troponin-T levels can be utilized as an important prognostic marker for adverse outcome in patients who present with acute ischemic syndromes.",

This study was designed to determine whether the ACE inhibitor perindoprilat can restore normal coronary dilative responses in hypertensive patients.", 
    "366": "Coronary vasomotor responses to CPT and to maximal increase of blood flow induced by papaverine were studied in 10 untreated patients with essential hypertension, no other risk factors, and angiographically normal coronary arteries before and after intravenous ACE inhibition by perindoprilat. Diameters of proximal and distal left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex coronary arteries were measured by quantitative angiography. Estimates of coronary blood flow and resistance index were calculated with an intracoronary Doppler catheter in the distal LAD. Perindoprilat did not modify the hemodynamic responses to CPT and papaverine. In response to CPT, perindoprilat changed the epicardial coronary constriction (-8.4 +/- 5.8%, P < .001) into a significant dilation (+12.0 +/- 6.4%, P < .001). Perindoprilat significantly increased the coronary blood flow (from 33.7 +/- 10.0 to 57.9 +/- 20.5 mL/min, P < .01) and enhanced the decrease in coronary resistance (from 4.28 +/- 1.27 to 2.96 +/- 0.84 mm Hg.mL-1.min-1, P < .001) caused by CPT.

    "368": "Mortality in patients with congestive heart failure has been assessed in several large scale multicentric studies, confirming the therapeutic effect of certain treatments and raising questions as to the efficacy of other, sometimes new propositions. Conversion enzyme inhibitors are currently considered to be the first line treatment for heart failure because of their beneficial effect on mortality figures and their capacity to prevent aggravation. These drugs should always be prescribed for patients without contraindications, together with diuretics when signs of congestion develop, and digitalis in case of non-response, then finally nitroglycerin. Debate is still open on the effect of beta-blockers and amiodarone which should be reserved for use by specialists since it has not been definitely proven that they can lengthen survival time. Certain other drugs have given disappointing results compared with early expectations: direct vasodilators, positive inotrops (with the possible exception of vesnarinone), and class Ic antiarrhythmics. Finally several drugs in the development or research stage may prove to be effective in improving heart function, intermediary criteria and, most importantly, survival.", 
    "369": "We tested the hypothesis that concurrent inhibition of the renin angiotensin system by enalapril (5 mg) and the sympathetic nervous system by alpha 1 adrenergic blockade (prazosin 1 mg) will be superior to enalapril alone in 17 patients with heart failure on standard therapy, in a single blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel group study for 4 weeks. Enalapril alone induced a significant increase in exercise time from 499 +/- 412 s to 707 +/- 608 s (P < 0.05, ANOVA), but the increase induced by the enalapril + prazosin combination was significantly greater (P < 0.025, MANOVA) from 214 +/- 271 to 1007 +/- 784 s as was the increase in creatinine clearance (P < 0.05).", 
    "370": "We investigated the relationship between exercise capacity and the level of neurohormonal activation at rest and during exercise in patients with various degrees of severity of chronic heart failure. We performed exercise testing with measurements of peak oxygen consumption (pVo2) and blood sampling at rest and at peak exercise in eight patients with moderate heart failure (pVo2 = 17 +/- 0.4 ml/kg/min) (mean +/- S.E.M.) and eight patients with severe CHF (pVo2 = 9 +/- 1 ml/kg/min). None of the patients was taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, cGMP, arginine-vasopressin, renin, angiotensin II, epinephrine and norepinephrine increased significantly (P < 0.01), from rest to peak exercise, in all patients. Among all the studied neurohormonal factors, only atrial natriuretic peptide levels at rest as well as at peak exercise, in patients with severe heart failure were correlated significantly to pVo2 (r = -0.77, P = 0.04; r = -0.85, P = 0.01, respectively) and to exercise duration (r = -0.72, P = 0.05; r = -0.79; P = 0.03, respectively). The relationship between plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and of cGMP was shifted downward in the more severe patients suggesting the loss of biological activity of atrial natriuretic peptide.", 
    "371": "Although increased deposition of collagen proteins has been described after myocardial infarction (MI), little is known of time-dependent transcriptional alteration of specific cardiac collagen sub-types as well as the degradative mechanisms for cardiac collagens in right and left ventricular myocardium remote to large left ventricular infarction. We sought to study collagen mRNA abundance and the deposition of specific collagen subtypes in noninfarcted left and right rat heart muscle at different times after MI. We also assessed the activity of different myocardial matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) using zymography to gain some information about degradative pathways for collagen. Furthermore, we assessed passive compliance properties of the right ventricle in experimental hearts. Finally we investigated the role of the renin angiotensin system in the collagen gene expression by administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramipril) and an angiotensin II receptor type I antagonist (losartan) in experimental animals. We observed that the mRNA abundance of types I and III collagen were increased 3 days after myocardial infarction in both viable left and uninfarcted right ventricular tissues, that they peaked at 7-14 days, and were maintained at relatively high levels in the 28 and 56 days experimental groups. Stiffness of the right ventricular myocardium was significantly increased in the 56 days experimental group when compared to that of control values. These findings correlated with increased immunohistochemical staining patterns of different collagen species in the surviving right (and left) cardiac interstitium of 14, 28, and 56 day experimental cardiac groups. The elevation of fibrillar collagen mRNA abundance in noninfarcted muscle from ventricular chambers was not significantly altered after treatment of experimental animals with ramipril and losartan for up to 14 days. MMP activity was increased in viable left ventricle at 14, 28 and 56 days and at 14 days in the right ventricle in experimental animals when compared to controls. These results indicated that (1) activation of transcription of collagen types I and III gene occurs in acute and chronic MI, and that fibrillar collagen proteins are deposited in the noninfarcted cardiac interstitium after a lag period relative to increased corresponding mRNA abundance; (2) an increase in MMP activity in chronic experimental hearts indicates that increased collagen deposition may be due to an increment in collagen synthesis rather by reduced degradation of collagen, and that MMP activation may be important in remodeling of the noninfarcted cardiac stroma; (3) an increase of right ventricular stiffness was associated with increased deposition of collagen; (4) as losartan treatment is not associated with any normalization of elevated collagen mRNA abundance, the upregulation of collagen gene expression in this model is not mediated by AT1 receptor; and (5) the reduction of cardiac fibrosis mediated by ACE inhibition and losartan treatment may reside at the post-translational level in cardiac collagen metabolism.", 
    "372": "The physiological factors which induce and maintain mammalian sperm maturation and motility generally remain unclear, although several agents are known to be involved. We recently described the application of immunocytochemical and immunoblotting methods to identify the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor in the tails of ejaculated rat and human sperm, and gave evidence to show that angiotensin II may promote sperm motility. These data are extended here by the application of a computerised sperm tracking system (the Hobson Sperm Tracker) to demonstrate that AII has actions on specific motility parameters, including curvilinear velocity, straight line velocity, and amplitude of lateral head movement. Since local tissue renin-angiotensin systems are present in both male and female tracts, the data suggest that angiotensin II has a role in the maintenance of sperm function and fertility.",

The pharmacological approach, using nitrates, converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium entry blockers and blockers of the autonomic nervous system, may decrease carotid stiffness through 3 different mechanism: passive decrease in blood pressure, active change in smooth muscle tone, and structural modifications of the carotid arterial wall. 3. In recent years, such changes have been studied in vivo, in both humans and rats, using original in situ carotid preparations and echotracking ultrasound techniques of high resolution, allowing to evaluate both static and dynamic stiffness. 4. This new approach for investigating arterial vessel through changes in both stiffness and thickness should provide a better evaluation of drug effects in cardiovascular pharmacology and new interpretations for cardiovascular events related to morbidity and mortality.",

    "378": "The aim of the study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of once-daily lisinopril vs enalapril both during normal daily activity and sleep, in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a 4-week wash-out period, 34 patients (17 M, 17 F) aged 22 to 67 years were randomized in a multicenter, open, parallel fashion: 17 received lisinopril (10-20 mg) and 17 enalapril (10-20 mg) for a 12-week period. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed using an oscillometric non-invasive automated device at both the end of the 4-week drug-free baseline period and during the last week of treatment. With no differences in initial blood pressure (BP) between groups, both drugs significantly reduced office and ABPM values. Lisinopril tended to reduce BP in a greater extension than enalapril, but only the reduction of office systolic BP (SBP) (p = 0.0062), 24-h SBP load (P = 0.0182) and night time SBP load (P = 0.0316) reached statistical significance. We conclude that, in spite of a more prominent reduction of SBP by lisinopril, both drugs have a similar efficacy in reducing BP, assessed by both office and ABPM measurements.",

Patients with myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular or congenital heart disease were excluded. Doppler diastolic early (E) and late (A) velocity of mitral inflow were measured. The following indexes were calculated: left ventricular mass index (LVMI) using the Penn convention; left ventricular stroke volume (LVSV); LA reservoir volume (LARV = LA maximal volume at mitral valve opening minus minimal volume); LA conduit volume (LACV = LVSV-LARV). Atrial systolic function was assessed by calculating the active emptying fraction (volume at onset of atrial systole minus minimal volume/volume at onset of atrial systole, the E/A ratio and the LA ejection force (0.5 rho A2 MOA, where rho = the density of blood, MOA = mitral orifice area from the parasternal short axis view).

LARV decreased significantly (from 35.4 to 29.3 cm3, P < 0.05) while LACV increased significantly (from 43.8 to 51.3 cm3, P < 0.05), LA active emptying fraction and E/A ratio did not change. LA ejection force decreased significantly (from 20.9 to 18.1 kdynes, P < 0.05) but it was greater than controls (16.7 kdynes, P < 0.01). There was a positive relationship of LVMI to LARV (P < 0.01) in controls (r = 0.77) which held true in hypertensive patients, before (r = 0.72) and after treatment (r = 0.69). There was a negative relationship of LVMI to LACV (P < 0.01) in controls (r = -0.65), and in hypertensive patients untreated (r = -0.74) and after treatment (r = -0.72).", 
    "383": "Our results showed that in hypertensive patients, LA reservoir function increases and LA conduit function decreases, while LA ejection force increases. Antihypertensive treatment with enalapril and/or thiazide, induces normalisation of the LA function in parallel to left ventricular hypertrophy regression.", 
    "384": "The octapeptide angiotensin II, the potent effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system, has been implicated in the pathology of hypertension, in cardiovascular diseases like cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy and in structural alterations of the heart such as post-infarct remodelling.", 
    "385": "The development of highly selective angiotensin II receptor ligands allowed the identification of angiotensin II receptor subtypes, designated AT1, AT2, AT3 and AT4. Most of the known effects of angiotensin II can be attributed to the AT1 receptor (e.g. vasoconstriction, aldosterone and vasopressin release and proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle and other cells). The AT1 receptor is coupled to G-proteins and engages classical intracellular second messenger systems, for example activation of phospholipase C or inhibition of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, the function and the signal transduction pathways of the AT2 receptor, which exhibits only a 32-34% homology to the AT1 receptor, are so far not fully understood. Coupling of the AT2 receptor to phosphatases and inhibitory actions on AT1 receptor- and growth factor-mediated proliferation in endothelial and other cells as well as induction of neuronal outgrowth in PC12w cells have been demonstrated. Due to its wide distribution in fetal tissues including the central nervous system and its transient reappearance in the adult organism under pathological conditions (for instance after myocardial infarction) the AT2 receptor has been associated with cell differentiation and regeneration.", 
    "386": "The application of orally active AT1 receptor antagonists as antihypertensive drugs has, compared to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, the potential advantage of a more specific renin-angiotensin system inhibition. It is conceivable that the AT2 receptor, left unopposed by AT1 receptor antagonists, contributes to some of the actions of these drugs.", 
    "387": "APOPTOSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPERTROPHY: Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a physiological counterpart of cell replication with shared as well as specific pathways. Our initial studies have demonstrated increased apoptosis in the heart, kidney and brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and mice, persisting in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. In these target organs of hypertension, programmed cell death paralleled the well known hypertrophy/hyperplasia. We also observed that the two processes can be dissociated in time, as in experimental hypertrophy of the heart induced by pressure overload. In this context, only a short-lived apoptotic window precedes the overt development of cardiac hypertrophy. EFFECTS IN HYPERTENSION: We now propose that a more prolonged apoptotic window is present in hypertension. Apoptosis seems to be significantly reduced during the first weeks of life in SHR, possibly contributing to the early cardiac hyperplasia. However, increased apoptosis is clearly evident thereafter throughout the development of hypertension and fades below the levels observed in normotensive animals after the age of 24 weeks. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPY AND APOPTOSIS: In addition to the apoptotic windows that suggest a dynamic regulation of this process in disease states, antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers can also modify the contribution of apoptosis, independently of the blood pressure fall. We propose that the presence of apoptotic windows and the involvement of this biological process as a primary or secondary event in cardiovascular remodeling should be taken into account when designing innovative therapeutic approaches.", 
    "388": "The introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists has increased our understanding of many aspects of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "389": "One recent observation is the alternative pathway of angiotensin II formation by serine proteases. So far, two types of angiotensin II-forming serine proteases have been identified: (1) aprotinin-sensitive or kallikrein type which forms bradykinin as well as angiotensin II, depending upon pH conditions. This may make some contribution to the regulation of tissue perfusion, as seen in the ischemic dog heart and the human leg; and (2) chymostatin-sensitive or the chymase type which only forms angiotensin II and may participate in structural remodelling of heart and vessels rather than in tissue perfusion. However, this type has high enzymatic potency and therefore may have other, as yet unknown, functions. Specific inhibitors may help to reveal these functions.", 
    "390": "RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPERTENSION: Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular and possibly renal organ damage. Microalbuminuria is a newly recognized cardiovascular and renal risk factor in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The prevalence of microalbuminuria is enhanced in hypertensive subjects, in particular in those with blood pressure characteristics that are associated with enhanced cardiovascular risk, such as salt-sensitivity and an abnormal diurnal blood pressure rhythm.", 
    "391": "Although microalbuminuria is more prevalent in hypertensives and is shown to be a strong and independent risk factor, the relation between microalbuminuria and hypertensive complications is unknown. Even more intriguing is the finding of elevated levels of microalbuminuria in normotensive children with one or two parents with hypertension. This suggests that microalbuminuria is linked to the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, the role and the cause(s) of microalbuminuria are uncertain. Microalbuminuria seems to link renal and cardiovascular organ damage. Microalbuminuria might be the consequence of (renal) organ damage induced by hypertension. Alternatively, microalbuminuria might be an independent marker of some process that occurs separately from diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia. Endothelial dysfunction has been suggested to underlie renal and/or cardiovascular organ damage in these diseases. More knowledge should be obtained on the cause and the natural course of microalbuminuria.", 
    "392": "Microalbuminuria possibly identifies at an early stage hypertensive patients with an enhanced risk of developing the well-known renal and cardiovascular hypertensive complications. For the patients at particular risk therapeutic measures than can be developed. If microalbuminuria identifies a specific underlying pathogenetic mechanism, these measures may intervene with such a mechanism. Alternatively, if microalbuminuria identifies enhanced risk then standard antihypertensive therapy can be intensified, since such measures also lower microalbuminuria.", 
    "393": "FUNCTIONAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR SELECTING PATIENTS FOR RENAL ARTERIOGRAPHY: The functional diagnostic tests now available to select patients for renal arteriography, such as captopril-renal scintigraphy and the captopril-peripheral vein renin test, have a high degree of diagnostic accuracy, 70% sensitivity at 90% specificity, but they are still not good enough to assess the large population of hypertensives for renal artery stenosis. The use of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor challenge and the introduction of a new pharmacon, technetium-labelled mercapto-triglycine, have not sufficiently increased the value of scintigraphy and further improvement in the near future seems unlikely. THE USE OF CLINICAL CRITERIA TO IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK PATIENTS: A more realistic approach to the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis is to seek simple and sensible clinical criteria to identify high-risk patients. The blood pressure response to 2 months of treatment with a standardized two-drug regimen is a suitable criterion. Interim analysis of an ongoing prospective multicentre study in the Netherlands indicates that the prevalence of renal artery stenosis is as high as 25% in patients who are resistant to the combination of 10 mg amlodipine + 50 mg atenolol, compared with 15% in patients resistant to the combination of 20 mg enalapril + 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. When drug resistance is used as the selection criterion for arteriography, the total number of cases detected with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography does not seem to differ according to which of these drug regimens is used. FUTURE POSSIBILITIES: The current enthusiasm for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and stenting may be premature. With further improvement of non-invasive techniques to visualize the renal arteries, such as colour Doppler ultrasound with microparticle contrast enhancement or magnetic resonance angiography, it should become more attractive to follow patients with renal artery stenosis while they are being treated with drugs rather than automatically resorting to PTRA.", 
    "394": "Microalbuminuria and proteinuria are strong independent predictors for increased cardiovascular mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients. In such patients, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition improves the evolution of diabetic nephropathy; however, no data are currently available on the effects of such intervention on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of the Diab-Hycar study is to test the hypothesis that ACE inhibition with a low daily dose of 1.25 mg ramipril, which has no significant effect on blood pressure, may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality in normotensive or hypertensive NIDDM patients with persistent albuminuria. Selected and followed by general practitioners, 4000 patients will receive their usual oral antidiabetic treatment and if necessary antihypertensive treatment (ACE inhibitors excluded). In addition in a randomized, double-blind trial they will be given either a placebo or 1.25 mg ramipril daily. The follow-up is currently scheduled to last 3 years. The efficacy of ACE-inhibition will be assessed by the following major end-points: cardiovascular death, sudden death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal replacement therapy. The Diab-Hycar study started on 3 February 1995. By 1 September 1995, 11,000 urine samples were tested. The prevalence of persistent albuminuria was 23%, 964 patients were initially included in the study, with 619 eligible patients included soon after. Different strategies have been developed to record cardiovascular events correctly and to minimize the number of patients lost to follow-up.", 
    "395": "Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension. During follow-up a progression of these alterations has been reported. In the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication.", 
    "396": "The patients were divided into three groups according to their medication. Group 1 was treated with beta-blocker (n = 17), group 2 with ACE inhibitors (n = 10), and group 3 with calcium channel blockers (n = 11). All patients underwent fluorescein angiographic studies with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Perifoveal intercapillary areas (PIA) and the mean perifoveal capillary velocity were quantified from the angiograms.",

    "399": "We propose the following guidelines for treatment of hypertension in the elderly. 1. Indications for Treatment. 1) Age: Lifestyle modification is recommended for patients aged 85 years and older. Antihypertensive therapy should be limited to patients in whom the merit of the treatment is obvious. 2) Blood pressure: Systolic BP > 160 mmHg, diastolic BP > 90 approximately 10 mmHg. Systolic BP < age + 100 mmHg for those aged 70 years and older. Patients with mild hypertension (140-160/ 90-95 mmHg) associated with cardiovascular disease should be considered for antihypertensive drug therapy. 2. Goal of Therapy for BP: The goal BP in elderly patients is higher than that in younger patients (BP reduction of 10-20 mmHg for systolic BP and 5-10 mmHg for diastolic BP). In general, 140-160/< 90 mmHg is recommended as the goal. However, lowering the BP below 150/85 should be done with caution. 3. Rate of Lowering BP: Start with half the usual dose, observe at the same dose for at least four weeks, and reach the target BP over two months. Increasing the dose of antihypertensive drugs should be done very slowly. 4. Lifestyle Modification: 1) Dietary modification: (1) Reduction of sodium intake is highly effective in elderly patients due to their high salt-sensitivity. NaCl intake of less than 10 g/day is recommended. Serum Na+ should be occasionally measured. (2) Potassium supplementation is recommended, but with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. (3) Sufficient intake of calcium and magnesium is recommended. (4) Reduce saturated fatty acids. Intake of fish is recommended. (2) Regular physical activity: Recommended exercise for patients aged 60 years and older: peak heart rate 110/minute, for 30-40 minutes a day, 3-5 days a week. (3) Weight reduction. (4) Moderation of alcohol intake, smoking cessation. 5. Pharmacologic Treatment: 1) Initial drug therapy. First choice: Long-acting (once or twice a day) Ca antagonists or ACE inhibitors. Second choice: Thiazide diuretics (combined with potassium-sparing diuretic). 2) Combination therapy. (1) For patients without complications, either of the following is recommended. i) Ca antagoinst + ACE inhibitor, ii) ACE inhibitor + Ca antagonist (or low-dose diuretics), iii) diuretic + Ca antagonist (or ACE inhibitor), iv) beta-blockers, alpha 1-blockers, alpha + beta blockers can be used according to the patho-physiological state of the patient. (2) For patients with complications. Drug(s) should be selected according to each complication. 3) Relatively contraindicated drugs. beta-Blockers and alpha 1-blockers are relatively contraindicated in elderly patients with hypertension in Japan. Centrally acting agents such as reserpine, methyldopa and clonidine are also relatively contraindicated beta-Blockers are contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure, arteriosclerosis obliterans, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus (or glucose intolerance), or bradycardia. These conditions are often present in elderly subjects. Elderly subjects are susceptible to alpha 1-blocker-induced orthostatic hypotension, since their baroreceptor reflex is diminished. Orthostatic hypotension may cause falls and bone fractures in the elderly.", 
    "400": "The aim of the study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of quinapril 20 mg once-a-day versus lisinopril 20 mg, in the treatment of old patients suffering from essential mild or moderate hypertension and presenting low levels of plasmarenin. It was a cross-over study with open treatments randomly assigned. Ten patients were treated, 6 females and 4 males, with average age of 67.1 years +/- 7.1. Two wash-out periods with placebo were scheduled, each lasting one week before the onset of active therapy; each treatment period lasted 21 days. Blood pressure controls (including the 24 hours monitoring) were done at basal time, after seven days and at the end of each treatment. Results show the efficacy and the safety of both the drugs and a more effective and constant control of hypertension by Quinapril was confirmed.", 
    "401": "Contractile responsiveness of the rabbit aorta (endothelium intact and denuded) to angiotensin I, II, and III was compared. The effects of converting-enzyme inhibition with enalapril, the selective AT1-receptor antagonist (losartan), and the AT2-receptor antagonist (PD 123319) on these contractile profiles were examined. In all preparations, it was found that the angiotensins produced concentration-dependent increases in tension. Differences in sensitivity were encountered; in endothelium-intact preparations, the mean EC50 values (nM with 95% confidence interval in parentheses) for angiotensin I, II, and III were 9 (95% CI 7-11), 40 (20-60), and 30 (10-40), respectively, and for denuded preparations they were 20 (11-29), 0.8 (0.7-0.9), and 30 (20-40), respectively. Enalapril decreased the maximal tension developed to angiotensin I and II, which was greater in endothelium-intact preparations. Losartan was a competitive antagonist against angiotensin I and angiotensin II in both intact and denuded preparations, with pA2 values as follows: against angiotensin I, 9.0 and 9.3 for intact and denuded, respectively; against angiotensin II, 8.3 and 8.9 for intact and denuded, respectively. Losartan antagonized angiotensin III, but the slopes of the Schild analysis were significantly less than unity. In endothelium-intact preparations, PD 123319 failed to significantly antagonize responsiveness to angiotensin I. Against angiotensin II, PD 123319 was a competitive antagonist with a pA2 of 8.3. The antagonism for PD 123319 against angiotensin III was insurmountable. In endothelium-denuded preparations, PD 123319 failed to antagonize angiotensin I and angiotensin III. Although PD 123319 appeared to inhibit the responsivenss of the rabbit aorta by angiotensin II, the slope of the Schild plot was significantly less than unity. These experiments provide evidence that angiotensin I possesses different actions from angiotensin II and III and that a functional endothelium modulates the underlying vascular response to angiotensin. In addition, the endothelium modulates the antagonism by losartan and PD 123319, supporting the notion that the endothelium possesses distinct angiotensin receptors.", 
    "402": "First-line antihypertensive monotherapy is effective in reducing blood pressure to within the normal range in approximately 50% of patients. Normalisation in the remaining patients may require a combination of two or more drugs. This review considers the clinical efficacy and tolerability of combinations involving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The efficacy of combinations with diuretics or calcium antagonists, as initial therapy or in patients with inadequate responses to monotherapy, has been demonstrated in many trials. With combination therapy, normalisation rates approaching 80% can be achieved using submaximal doses of both components. Therapy with both combinations is well tolerated; with ACE inhibitors reducing the diuretic metabolic effects or counteracting some calcium antagonist-associated vasodilatory effects. Data on ACE inhibitors with beta-blockers are limited. When patients respond inadequately to first-line monotherapy, the increasing availability of drug combinations will allow individual selection of the most appropriate combination, taking account of additional risk factors and concomitant disease.",

    "404": "Rilmenidine (dose of 1 mg once or twice a day) is the first oxazoline compound with antihypertensive properties. Its effects on lipid parameters [total cholesterol, HDL and LDL fractions, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1 and B, lipoprotein (a)] were compared under double-blind conditions and in parallel groups to those of captopril (50 to 100 mg per day, in 2 divided doses) over a period of 8 weeks, in 51 hyperlipidaemic hypertensive patients [age: 56.3 +/- 1.5 years, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP): 165.1 +/- 2.0/99.1 +/- 0.6 mmHg, LDL cholesterol: 5.38 +/- 0.16 mmol/L]. No significant difference was demonstrated between the groups on inclusion for any of the clinical parameters (SBP, DBP, heart rate (HR)) and laboratory parameters, apart from apolipoprotein A1, for which the mean value was higher in the rilmenidine group than in the captopril group (p < 0.05). No difference between the groups was demonstrated during the 8 weeks of treatment for the course of blood pressure: SBP and DBP decreased by 20.5 and 13.9 mmHg, respectively, in the rilmenidine group and by 21.3 and 13.1 mmHg in the captopril group (no significant difference: NS). HR decreased by 0.3 beats per minute (bpm) in the rilmenidine group and by 4.1 bpm in the captopril group (NS). No statistically significant difference in lipid parameters was observed between the two groups. No clinically significant variation in any of the lipid parameters was observed after 8 weeks of treatment with rilmenidine or captopril. These results confirm the antihypertensive efficacy and neutrality of rilmenidine on lipid metabolism over a period of 8 weeks. Rilmenidine therefore represents a useful alternative in the first-line treatment of hypertension in hyperlipidaemic hypertensive patients.",

CASE NOTE AUDIT: 15/40 (38%) patients presenting with angioedema on 19/48 (40%) occasions were taking an ACE-I. These patients were older and less likely to have an atopic history than those not taking an ACE-I. The onset of angioedema after starting an ACE-I was delayed for greater than six months in nine patients. ACE-I therapy was continued after 53% of presentations.

As a result of such investigations, a polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme gene has been described and the role of this polymorphism as a possible risk factor for coronary heart disease has been reported.

Beginning at 6 weeks of age, SPSHR were treated with either distilled water (control) or different daily dosages of perindopril (1 or 4 mg/kg) by gavage for 24 weeks followed by treatment withdrawal. Additional subgroups were treated with the 4 mg/kg dose for different durations (B, 12 or 24 weeks) before treatment withdrawal. Treatment effects on blood pressure, heart rate and body weight were studied during the treatment period and after the withdrawal of the treatment.

The middle cerebral arteries from these animals had lost their ability to contract in response to pressure increase. Chronic treatment of SPSHR with perindopril when initiated at 6 weeks of age attenuated the sharp blood pressure rise, and prevented the development of stroke during the treatment period. This was associated with the preservation of the myogenic response of the middle cerebral arteries to pressure increase, and the prevention of tissue damage in the kidneys and brain. After withdrawal of the treatment, SPSHR treated for a longer period (12 or 24 weeks) also survived longer than those treated for a shorter period (8 weeks).

In addition, rat studies indicate that eutrophic remodelling, rather than growth, is found in all vascular beds. Antihypertensive treatment of hypertensive rats with ACE inhibitors causes a dose-dependent regression of the media: lumen ratio. Clinical studies have now confirmed these findings, showing that when previously untreated essential hypertensive patients are treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril the abnormal structure of resistance vessels regresses towards normal values; in contrast, treatment with a beta-blocker does not affect the abnormal vascular structure.",

Although these studies have focused predominantly on patients with overt proteinuria, more recently a number of investigators have explored the role of ACE inhibitors in both type I and type II diabetic patients with an earlier phase of diabetic renal disease known as microalbuminuria. These agents are now being considered as renoprotective agents not only in hypertensive patients but also in those with 'normal' blood pressure. Initially, studies in type I diabetic patients showed that ACE inhibition was effective in retarding the increase in albuminuria which was observed in placebo treated groups. More recently, several multi-centre placebo controlled studies have been performed suggesting that prolonged treatment not only reduced albuminuria but also preserved renal function. The role of ACE inhibition in microalbuminuric type II diabetic patients is less well characterised although several studies have recently described beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on albuminuria and possibly on renal function.", 
    "433": "Although ACE inhibitors have been clearly shown to reduce urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients, the issue as to whether they confer a specific benefit over other classes of antihypertensive agents remains controversial. Several meta-analyses have suggested that ACE inhibitors are more potent at decreasing albuminuria or proteinuria than other antihypertensive agents, for a given reduction in blood pressure. The Melbourne Diabetic Nephropathy Study Group has instituted a study which is placebo-controlled and is confined to normotensive type I and type II diabetic patients. The ACE inhibitor perindopril has been compared not only with placebo but also with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nifedipine. Preliminary analysis reveals that after 12 and 24 months of treatment, perindopril is more effective in reducing albuminuria than placebo or nifedipine.",

    "435": "The increasing availability of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has shifted interest in blood pressure measurement from the doctor's office to the entire 24-h period. Routine office blood pressure recordings correlate poorly with left ventricular mass, a sign of early target-organ damage. In contrast, ambulatory blood pressure or estimates of 24-h blood pressure load show a good correlation with left ventricular mass.", 
    "436": "Circadian blood pressure rhythms may be important in determining future cardiovascular events. For example, patients who maintain high nocturnal blood pressures (non-dippers) experience more cardiovascular sequelae than do nocturnal dippers, with women non-dippers having the greatest risk. Longer-acting antihypertensive drugs may return circadian blood pressure rhythms to normal by converting non-dippers to dippers. Adequate control of blood pressure toward the end of each 24-h cycle may reduce the early morning rise in cardiovascular events associated with awakening and ambulation.", 
    "437": "Recent improvements in the estimation of trough to peak ratio have provided a useful arithmetic index for comparing the antihypertensive effects of different compounds over 24-h dosing intervals. Long-acting agents have now been identified in each of the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, making it now possible to maximize target-organ protection by achieving good 24-h blood pressure control in most hypertensive patients.",

    "442": "Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to affect left ventricular (LV) remodeling favorably in several conditions, it remains unclear whether they can influence LV geometric pattern in hypertension. To address this issue, 122 patients (71 men and 51 women; mean age = 51 +/- 10 years) with mild to moderate hypertension were studied prospectively. All underwent clinical evaluation and Doppler echocardiography at entry and more than 2 years of quinapril therapy (10-40 mg/day). According to either LV mass (normal if < 131 g/m2 for men or < 100 g/m2 for women) or the ratio of LV posterior wall thickness to diastolic diameter (RWT; normal if < 0.45) at baseline, 58 patients had normal mass and RWT, 18 patients had concentric remodelling (i.e., normal mass but increased RWT), 24 patients had eccentric hypertrophy (i.e., increased mass but normal RWT), and 22 patients had concentric hypertrophy (i.e., increase in both mass and RWT). After 6 months of quinapril therapy, all patients with normal left ventricles showed the maintenance of mass and RWT within normal limits. Patients with concentric remodeling showed no increase in mass but had a significant decrease in RWT. Patients with eccentric hypertrophy exhibited a significant reduction in mass with no substantial change in RWT. Patients with concentric hypertrophy had a significant reduction in both mass and RWT. Changes in LV mass and geometry were maintained during the 2-year period of treatment and were paralleled by improvements in Doppler indices of LV diastolic function in each group. It is concluded that quinapril, with its well-known effects on LV hypertrophy, modifies the LV geometric pattern of hypertensive patients favorably, regardless of the presence of an abnormal LV mass or RWT.", 
    "443": "This review discusses the clinical consequences of urinary protein loss and the effects of inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on this clinical finding. Proteinuria appears to be an important risk factor for renal function deterioration and for cardiovascular mortality. ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce proteinuria more effectively than other antihypertensives. Their antiproteinuric effect seems to be independent of the underlying renal disease, and is mediated by a specific, not yet fully elucidated mechanism. Urinary protein loss related phenomena, such as hypoalbuminemia and aberrant lipoprotein profile, tend to improve also during ACE inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, ACE inhibition has been shown to prevent the renal function deterioration that is frequently observed in patients with renal disease. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that in proteinuric patients with renal disease the initial proteinuria lowering response to ACE inhibition predicts long-term renal function outcome during this treatment the more proteinuna is lowered during the first months, the better renal function will be preserved over the following years. Because of these favorable effects ACE inhibitors have become a widely used class of agents in nephrology. They are not only prescribed for lowering blood pressure in the hypertensive renal patient, but also as symptomatic treatment of patients with proteinuria, and to prevent renal function loss in patients with both diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease.", 
    "444": "The treatment of patients with end-stage renal failure using dialysis has become an important factor in the health budgets of the developed countries. Thus, prevention of progression of renal disease and a reduction in the number of patients requiring dialysis should have a beneficial impact on health budgets. This review will examine the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) on the progression of renal disease. Both CCBs and ACE-Is have been shown to slow progression in various animal models of various renal diseases. In the human with diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease, most CCBs have caused a stabilization of renal function and in some cases a decrease in proteinuria. ACE-Is have been effective in reducing proteinuria and stabilizing renal function in both diabetic and non-diabetic disease, this effect being independent of the antihypertensive effect. There are good theoretical reasons for using a combination of these two classes of medications, but there are still insufficient clinical data. In summary, both CCBs and ACE-Is may be used to slow the progression of renal disease. ACE-Is seem to be preferable, but there may be an advantage to the use of a combination of both agents.", 
    "445": "In 10 anaesthetized cats, electroretinographic (ERG) measurements were carried out to further elucidate the involvement of bradykinin as a substrate component of the renin-angiotensin system in retinal neurotransmission. Reducing angiotensin II concentration by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition increased sensitivity (0.5 log units) and gain (50%) of the rod b-wave amplitude. The b-wave implicit time was decreased only at high stimulus intensities (> 10(-2) cd/m). Blocking bradykinin receptors specifically decreased rod b-wave implicit time for all intensities, while its amplitude remained unaffected. Bradykinin effects were independent of alterations of angiotensin II activity. We therefore suggest that bradykinin influences inner retinal signal processing, hereby further supporting the hypothesis of a renin-angiotensin system involvement in retinal neurotransmission.",

This study examined the effects of systemic hypertension and treatment of hypertension in groups of normal non-nephritic rats and rats submitted to 16 wk of glomerulonephritis induced by the administration of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody. Hypertension was produced by application of a clip to the right renal artery and blood pressure was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril. Glomerulosclerosis of two types developed: a diffuse type that is characteristic of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis, and a focal segmental glomerulosclerosis that is characteristic of systemic hypertension. Glomerulonephritis significantly reduced the capacity of ACE inhibitors to decrease systolic blood pressure in awake animals. In addition, glomerulonephritis produced significant effects on plasma angiotensin II concentrations, whereby ACE inhibition no longer lowered plasma angiotensin II levels and in fact produced an increase. Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and hydrostatic pressure gradient correlated with systolic blood pressure and with the incidence of focal glomerulosclerosis in non-nephritic rats. However, in glomerulonephritis, systolic blood pressure no longer correlated with glomerular capillary pressure, and glomerular capillary pressure no longer correlated with the development of glomerulosclerosis, although systolic blood pressure did correlate with the degree of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Concurrent glomerulonephritis strongly conditions the effects of superimposed hypertension by altering the relationship between systemic blood pressure and glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and by decreasing the response of hypertension to therapy.",

The contractile response to angiotensin II was augmented in endothelium-denuded mesenteric artery segments of the rat with CHF, which was attenuated by indomethacin or diclofenac sodium but not by bunazosin. Trandolapril (3 mg/kg/d) was administered orally from the 2nd to 12th week after the operation. Treatment with trandolapril reversed the augmented contractile response of the rat with CHF to norepinephrine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and angiotensin II almost to the levels in the sham-operated rat.",

Myocardial infarction, hypertrophy, hypertension and heart failure are well known to be associated with progressive cardiac fibrosis. Vascular hypertrophy and thickening has been associated with the pathological series of events that attends both hypertension and restenosis. The accumulation of ECM in the cardiovascular system plays an important role in the development of heart failure after myocardial infarction and hypertension, as well as in vascular hypertrophy and restenosis. Angiotensin II (angiotensin) and transforming growth factor beta 1 are known to play a role in signalling the abnormal accumulation of ECM in these cardiovascular diseases.

A 12-week treatment with the drug combination (1 mg/kg per day) was not accompanied by any change in diuresis or urinary excretion of Na or K. The same treatment decreased cardiac hypertrophy and collagen. At the vascular level, the drug combination decreased aortic, carotid and femoral media cross-sectional areas, as well as aortic and carotid collagen density. This latter effect was accompanied by a significant increase in carotid artery compliance assessed in vivo at constant pressure.

M-mode and pulsed Doppler echocardiography were performed before and after treatment, and changes in various parameters after treatment with enalapril were examined. ACE gene polymorphism was examined by the polymerase chain reaction method and the patients were classified as having the 190 bp deletion homozygous (DD) genotype, the 490 bp insertion homozygous (II) genotype or the 490 bp insertion 190 bp deletion heterozygous (ID) genotype.",

In all of the 60 patients, the left ventricular mass index, the peak atrial systolic velocity:early diastolic velocity ratio and the deceleration time from the peak of the early diastolic wave to the baseline in transmitral flow velocity were decreased significantly after treatment with enalapril.

    "462": "1. Male, Long Evans rats were instrumented chronically with pulsed Doppler probes and intravascular catheters to allow assessment of regional haemodynamic changes during i.v. infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 150 micrograms kg-1 h-1). 2. In the presence of the AT1-receptor antagonists, losartan (10 mg kg-1 + 10 kg-1 h-1), the initial (1-2 h) hypotensive and renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilator responses to LPS were enhanced significantly. Thereafter these effects waned, but between 8-23 h after the onset of LPS infusion, a further fall in mean atrial blood pressure (MAP) and increases in renal and hindquarters flows and conductances occurred. All these changes were significantly greater than seen with losartan or LPS alone, and exceeded the sum of their effects. 3. In the presence of captopril (2 mg kg-1 + 2 mg kg-1 h-1), the initial hypotensive and renal vasodilator responses to LPS were enhanced, but less so than in the presence of losartan. However, the effects of LPS in the presence of losartan and captopril together were not different from those in the presence of losartan alone. These observations indicate that the ability of captopril to inhibit the degradation of bradykinin had no additional influence, and the differences between the effect of captopril and losartan on the initial effects of LPS were probably due to more effective suppression of the action of angiotensin II by losartan. 4. In the absence of LPS, co-infusion of losartan and the non-selective endothelin antagonist, SB 209670 (600 micrograms kg-1 + 600 micrograms kg-1 h-1), caused a substantial, progressive hypotension (-25 +/- 2 mmHg at 24 h) accompanied by increases in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular conductances (31 +/- 13, 44 +/- 9 and 45 +/- 12%, respectively), indicating an involvement of angiotensin II and endothelin in the maintenance of normal cardiovascular status in conscious, Long Evans rats. 5. In the presence of losartan and SB 209670, the initial, LPS-induced fall in MAP (-42 +/- 2 mmHg) was not different from that in the presence of losartan (-39 +/- 4 mmHg), and the increases in renal, in mesenteric, and in hindquarters vascular conductances were similar in the two conditions. However, there was no recovery in MAP, and there were persistent renal, mesenteric and hindquarter vasodilatations. 6. In all experiments involving LPS, administration of the V1- receptor antagonist, d(CH2)5-O-Me-Tyr-AVP (10 micrograms kg-1), 23 h after the start of LPS infusion caused additional hypotension and mesenteric vasodilatation, particularly. This effect was most marked in animals pretreated with losartan and SB 209670. 7. The results indicate that the initial (1-2 h) depressor and dilator effects of LPS infusion in conscious Long Evans rats are opposed by the actions of angiotensins II, rather than endothelin. However, between 2-8 h after the onset of LPS infusion the involvement of endothelin develops and that of angiotensin II fades. By 24 h after the start of infusion of LPS, the pressor and vasoconstrictor actions of endothelin wane, and a role of vasopressin is apparent. At no stage is there clear evidence for an involvement of bradykinin in the haemodynamic sequelae of endotoxaemia in this model.",

It was also undertaken to assess the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril on diabetes-associated albuminuria. Ambulatory BP was recorded during daytime in 54 patients with type II diabetes mellitus at the end of a 4-week period during which they received no vasoactive drug. The difference between office and ambulatory BP was unpredictable in the individual patient. There was no significant correlation between either ambulatory or office BP and urinary albumin/p5eatinine ratio. Fifty-one patients underwent a 40-week treatment with 5 mg/day of cilazapril. There was, in the absence of satisfactory BP control, the possibility of adding the calcium antagonist amlodipine (5 mg/day) from the 10th week onward and 12.5 mg/day of hydrochlorothiazide from the 20th week onward. Office mean BP was significantly reduced after 30 to 40 weeks of therapy in patients with normoalbuminuria (n = 19, -14%, P < .001), in those with microalbuminuria (n = 22, -6.6%, P < .01), as well as in those with clinical proteinuria (n = 9, -11.4%, P < .01). During the same time, the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was not modified in normoalbuminuric patients (n = 19, +24.6%, P = .72) as well as in those with clinical proteinuria (n = 9, -29.4%, P = .09). On the other hand this value was significantly reduced for the group with microalbuminuria (n = 23, -24.3%, P < .05). In the overall population, as well as in hyperalbuminuric patients (patients with microalbuminuria + patients with clinical proteinuria), the reduction of the albumin/ creatinine ratio was also significant (n = 51, -7%, P < .01 and n = 32, -25,7%, P < .01, respectively). In conclusion, the findings of this study performed by practicing physicians show that ambulatory BP may differ greatly from office BP in diabetic patients. They also indicate that urinary albumin excretion is poorly correlated with office and ambulatory BP in type II diabetics. Finally, they demonstrate the antiproteinuric action of prolonged treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, whether given alone or combined with amlodipine.", 
    "468": "The aim was to evaluate the effects of a change of treatment from beta-blocker to captopril on the quality of life of hypertensive patients. One hundred forty-nine mild to moderate hypertensive patients who were being treated with beta-blockers were randomly assigned to receive captopril (12.5 to 50 mg twice daily), or to continue on beta-blocker treatment (atenolol: 25 to 100 mg once daily [n = 121], or propranolol, 10 to 80 mg twice daily [n = 12]). When required, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide was added in each group. The patients were followed over periods ranging from 6 to 12 months. Blood pressure, treatment side effects, and quality of life were monitored. Blood pressure was equally well managed in both groups, though a lower level of treatment was required in the captopril group. The captopril treated patients exhibited favorable changes in several aspects of quality of life: sleep-related, gastrointestinal, and physical activity-related symptoms improved from baseline to end of follow-up. Drowsiness and the ability to concentrate significantly improved in the captopril group only (P <.01). Change in treatment from beta-blocker to captopril resulted in equally well controlled blood pressure on a lower drug dose. Moreover, the change to captopril had a positive impact on the quality of life.", 
    "469": "Renal disease in elderly diabetic patients is costly in terms of morbidity, mortality and medical payments. Therefore, prevention of diabetic nephropathy has become a prominent goal in the treatment of diabetic patients. Preventive treatment should begin not later than at the stage of persistent microalbuminuria, and regular screening for microalbuminuria is recommended for both elderly and younger diabetic patients. Improved metabolic control, through diet and hypoglycaemic therapy, has been demonstrated to lower urinary albumin excretion. The target level of glycated haemoglobin is < 8%, or < 2% higher than the upper limit of normal in nondiabetic people. Insulin therapy has no adverse effects on renal indices, unless it increases bodyweight and consequently raises blood pressure. To preserve renal function in elderly diabetic patients, blood pressure should be kept well below 140/90 mm Hg. Treatment with ACE inhibitors may be the 'gold standard' intervention, and should be initiated at the lowest possible dosage and then titrated until the maximum tolerated dosage has been reached. Nonchronotropic calcium antagonists have been shown to be as effective as ACE inhibitors with regard to their effects on blood pressure, renal haemodynamics and urinary albumin excretion. Most dihydropyridines have been found to increase or to have no effect on urinary albumin excretion despite significant blood pressure reduction. A renoprotective action of diuretics is generally unlikely, with the possible exception of indapamide. Although beta-blockers are effective antihypertensive agents, they may not adequately preserve kidney function in diabetic patients. Because beta-blocker treatment may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, they should be reserved for patients with coronary artery disease or arrhythmias.", 
    "470": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been suggested to act in part by potentiating the stimulatory effect of bradykinin on endothelial prostacyclin and/or nitric oxide (NO) formation. This may give rise to interaction with cyclo-oxygenase inhibiting drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is most often used in low doses in patients with cardiovascular diseases. 2. We investigated the effects of captopril (2 x 25 mg day-1), or ASA (1 x 100 mg day-1), or the combination of both drugs for 7 days, on blood pressure, prostanoid and NO formation rates in a double-blind, double dummy, randomized crossover study in 13 healthy female subjects. The urinary metabolites of thromboxane A2 (2,3-dinor-TXB2) and prostacyclin (2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha), and PGE2 were measured by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in urine on days 1, 6 and 7 of each medication. NO formation was assessed using urinary NO3- and cyclic GMP as indicators. 3. Urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion was not significantly changed by either captopril, ASA, or their combination. Urinary 2,3-dinor-TXB2 excretion was inhibited by > 80% by ASA alone or in combination with captopril (each P < 0.05), but was not affected by captopril alone. Urinary PGE2 excretion was not significantly changed by either of the treatments. Urinary NO3- and cyclic GMP excretion rates were not significantly changed by captopril, ASA, or their combination. 4. Blood pressure was slightly reduced by captopril. ASA had no effect on blood pressure when given alone, nor did it modulate the effect of captopril on blood pressure during co-administration. Angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio (index of ACE activity) was significantly decreased by captopril alone or in combination with ASA, but was unaffected by ASA alone. 5. Captopril does not stimulate prostacyclin formation in healthy human subjects in a dose sufficient to substantially inhibit ACE activity. Co-administration of ASA significantly inhibits 2,3-dinor-TXB2 excretion, but does not interfere with the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril in healthy human subjects.",

    "475": "The preponderance of the medical literature supports the concept that modest or moderate dietary salt restriction enhances the blood pressure lowering responses to most antihypertensive medications and may permit either dose reduction or, in a few cases, complete drug withdrawal. Moreover, reduction in salt intake has a permissive action on the antiproteinuric responses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It does not, however, affect proteinuria in those receiving dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. The importance of selecting out those individuals who can most benefit from dietary salt modification (the \"salt sensitive\" groups of hypertensive patients) is important. Prospective randomized clinical studies are needed to assess the correlation between dietary salt intake and renal endpoints, such as time dialysis. This will be particularly important in different demographic groups that may have a greater predisposition to salt sensitivity, such as elderly or obese hypertensives, hypertensives of black or Hispanic descent, and those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.", 
    "476": "Somatic angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE; kininase II) has two active sites, in two (N and C) domains. We studied the active centers with separate N-domain ACE (N-ACE), testicular C-domain ACE (germinal ACE) and, as control, renal somatic ACE. Germinal ACE cleaved the nonapeptide bradykinin about two times faster than N-ACE in 20 mM Cl-. Bradykinin1-7 was hydrolyzed further to bradykinin1-5 by N-ACE four times faster in the absence of Cl-, but at 300 mM Cl- the C-domain hydrolyzed it twice as fast. The hematopoietic system regulatory peptide acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro was split to two dipeptides by N-ACE, depending on the chloride concentration, 8 to 24 times faster than by germinal ACE; at 100 mM Cl-, the Kcat with N-ACE was eight times higher. One millimolar 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene inhibited germinal ACE 96% but it inhibited N-ACE by only 31%. [3H]Ramiprilat was displaced by other unlabeled ACE inhibitors to establish their relative affinities. Captopril had the lowest IC50 (0.5 nM) with N-ACE and the highest IC50 (8.3 nM) with the germinal ACE. The IC50 values of ramiprilat and quinaprilat were about the same with both active sites. The association and dissociation constants of [3H]ramiprilat indicated faster association with and faster dissociation from N-ACE than from germinal ACE. After exposure to alkali or moderate heat, somatic ACE was cleaved by plasmin and kallikrein, releasing N-ACE and apparently inactivating the C-domain. These studies affirm the differences in the activity, stability and inhibition of the two active sites of ACE.", 
    "477": "The effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (losartan), angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), and calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) on autoregulation of total and zonal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), 10 and 40 weeks of age, and 10-week-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Untreated animals in each group served as controls. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured by a transit-time flow probe (Transonic) on the left renal artery. Total and zonal GFR (outer, middle, and inner cortex) were estimated from tubular uptake of 125iodine-labeled aprotinin (125IAp) injected i.v. at control renal arterial pressure (RAP), and 131IAp injected at a RAP reduced to the lower limit of RBF autoregulation. Autoregulation of RBF was reset to higher pressure levels in untreated hypertensive rats. Enalapril normalized this resetting in 10-week-old SHRs, but not in aged SHRs 40 weeks. Losartan did not completely normalize this resetting in either 10-or 40-week-old SHRs, whereas nifedipine impaired RBF autoregulation in both WKYs and SHRs. A decreased autoregulatory compensation of GFR after pressure reduction was observed in losartan-treated 10-week-old SHRs and after all drug regimens in 40-week SHRs. GFR autoregulation in outer, middle, and inner cortex was impaired in losartan-treated 10-and 40-week-old SHRs. With all treatments, the autoregulation in 10- and 40-week-old SHRs was better preserved in the inner than in the outer cortex. The impaired autoregulation may indicate that a part of the dilatory capacity of preglomerular vessels has already been taken out by hypotensive treatment. Renal vascular abnormalities may have an additional effect.", 
    "478": "Moexipril is a new, long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In contrast to captopril, it is a prodrug of the pharmacologically active agent moexiprilat and will be administered once daily. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of moexipril with that of captopril during a 12-week treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95-114 mm Hg, inclusive, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive moexipril, 7.5 mg, once daily or captopril, 25 mg, twice daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, the dose of moexipril and captopril was increased to 15 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily, respectively, if the patient's SDBP remained > or = 90 mm Hg. Blood pressure was measured at biweekly visits. At study endpoint, adjusted mean reductions in SDBP were comparable between the moexipril and captopril groups (-9.8 vs. -8.7 mm Hg), and moexipril was more effective than captopril in reducing sitting systolic blood pressure. Adverse experiences (headache, dizziness, and upper respiratory infection) occurred at similar frequencies in the moexipril and in the captopril groups. The data indicate that moexipril at dosages of 7.5 and 15 mg once daily is as efficacious as twice daily captopril in reducing blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "479": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce myocardial remodeling and improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction. We investigated whether the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition were associated with changes in the levels of angiotensin and bradykinin peptides in blood, heart, lung, aorta, and kidney. Rats subjected to coronary artery ligation and selected by ECG criteria to have moderate to large myocardial infarctions (mean size, 38%) were administered perindopril (0, 20, 200, and 2,000 micrograms/kg/day) in their drinking water from the second day after surgery for 26 days. Perindopril caused a dose-related decrease in blood pressure and inhibited the development of both cardiac hypertrophy (estimated by heart weight/body weight ratio) and cardiac failure (estimated by lung weight/body weight ratio). Perindopril inhibited plasma ACE activity and increased plasma renin, with an associated decrease in plasma angiotensinogen. Plasma and all tissues showed a marked reduction in angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio, indicating effective inhibition of ACE in plasma and tissues. Whereas heart, lung, and kidney showed dose-related decreases in angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, plasma and aortic levels of Ang II were not altered by perindopril. Perindopril increased blood bradykinin levels but did not increase bradykinin levels in heart, lung, aorta, or kidney. Heart showed a 45% increase in bradykinin levels at the highest dose of perindopril, which did not achieve statistical significance, although perindopril reduced the bradykinin(1-7)/ bradykinin-(1-9) ratio in heart, indicating inhibition of cardiac metabolism of bradykinin by perindopril. By contrast, perindopril reduced bradykinin levels in lung. These data support a role for reduced blood pressure and cardiac Ang II levels in mediating the effects of ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction but do not support a role for tissue bradykinin in this process.", 
    "480": "This study was designed to determine whether decreases in the circadian variability of arterial blood pressure and heart rate measured in ambulatory patients would correlate with neurohumoral indices of the severity of congestive heart failure not the result of systemic arterial hypertension, and whether treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors would restore a more normal pattern. The study also examined the ability of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to discern pharmacodynamic patterns in patients with congestive heart failure, which is associated with decreased variability in circadian variations in blood pressure and heart rate among hospitalized patients. Increased plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have a positive correlation with worsening clinical status. ACE inhibitors have been found to be beneficial in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and neurohumoral measurements were recorded in 30 patients with congestive heart failure (class II-IV, New York Heart Association) before treatment with lisinopril or captopril and repeated after 6 weeks of treatment. Fourier analysis was used as a curve-smoothing technique to compare the pharmacodynamics of the two ACE inhibitors. The absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure correlated inversely with plasma norepinephrine and ANP (p = 0.004) but not with renin activity. Mean 24-h systemic arterial blood pressure did not decrease significantly after treatment with ACE inhibitors. An increase in absolute amplitude of systolic blood pressure correlated inversely with baseline amplitude (p < 0.00001). Inspection of the Fourier-smoothed curves demonstrated differences in the circadian effect of lisinopril and captopril on systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitoring may prove useful in the assessment of the severity and treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "481": "The ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes) Trial is a large, prospective, randomized clinical trial of 950 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) designed to compare the effects of intensive blood pressure control with moderate control on the prevention and progression of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy in NIDDM. The secondary objective is to determine equivalency of the effects of a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) as a first-line antihypertensive agent in the prevention and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consists of two study populations aged 40-74 years, 470 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure of > or = 90.0 mmHg at time of randomization) and 480 normotensive patients (diastolic blood pressure of 80.0 mmHg at time of randomization). The study duration is 5 years and is scheduled to end in May of 1998. Patients are randomized to receive either intensive antihypertensive drug therapy or moderate antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients are also randomized to nisoldipine or enalapril, with open-label medications added if further blood pressure control is necessary. The primary outcome measure is glomerular filtration rate as assessed by 24-h creatinine clearance. Secondary outcome measures are urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will also be evaluated. Given the data showing the impact of hypertension on complications in NIDDM, the ABCD Trial is designed to determine if intensive antihypertensive therapy will be more efficacious than moderate antihypertensive therapy on the outcome of diabetic complications in NIDDM.", 
    "482": "The clinical importance of selection of different antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of diabetic patients is still unclear. Thus we performed a randomised, controlled study in 105 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients with microalbuminuria over 1 year. Patients received either the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (2.5-5.0 mg/day; in addition 24% of patients also received felodipine) or the beta blocking agent atenolol (50-100 mg/day; in addition 24% of patients also received hydrochlorothiazide). Blood pressure, metabolic control, lipid levels and albumin excretion rate were studied during the follow-up. After 1 year an almost identical fall (p < 0.001) in blood pressure was observed with ramipril (170/100 vs 150/ 85 mmHg, median) and atenolol (180/100 vs 150/ 80 mmHg, median). With ramipril a reduction of total cholesterol (6.3 vs 5.9 mmol/l), of LDL cholesterol (3.8 vs 3.6 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol (1.3 vs 1.2 mmol/l) was found, whereas triglycerides slightly increased (1.8 vs 2.0 mmol/l). With atenolol a similar reduction of total cholesterol (6.3 vs 5.9 mmol/l), LDL cholesterol (3.8 vs 3.7 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol (1.4 vs 1.2 mmol/l) and an increase of triglycerides (1.4 vs 1.7 mmol/l) was noted. Metabolic control of the patients was maintained with both ramipril and atenolol treatment. With ramipril treatment urinary albumin creatinine ratio (14.4 vs 13.8 mg/mmol) and creatinine clearance (82 vs 84 ml/min) were constant, but with atenolol an increase of albumin creatinine ratio (13.9 vs 19 mg/mmol, p < 0.001) and a slight decrease of creatinine clearance (80 vs 66 ml/min, p < 0.05, not significant after Bonferroni correction) was observed.", 
    "483": "1-year treatment of NIDDM patients with ramipril or atenolol does not influence metabolic control, the changes in serum lipids were similar. Despite almost identical blood pressure reduction in both groups the albumin creatinine ratio was constant under ramipril, but increased under atenolol treatment.", 
    "484": "Microalbuminuria predicts overt nephropathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients; however, the structural basis for this functional abnormality is unknown. In this study we evaluated renal structure and function in a cohort of 34 unselected microalbuminuric NIDDM patients (26 male/8 female, age: 58 +/- 7 years, known diabetes duration: 11 +/- 6 years, HbA1c: 8.5 +/- 1.6%). Systemic hypertension was present in all but 3. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 101 +/- 27 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 and albumin excretion rate (AER) 44 (20-199) micrograms/ min. Light microscopic slides were categorized as: C I) normal or near normal renal structure; C II) changes \"typical\" of diabetic nephropathology in insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) (glomerular, tubulo-interstitial and arteriolar changes occurring in parallel); C III) \"atypical\" patterns of injury, with absent or only mild diabetic glomerular changes associated with disproportionately severe renal structural changes including: important tubulo-interstitial with or without arteriolar hyalinosis with or without global glomerular sclerosis. Ten patients (29.4%) were classified as C I, 10 as C II (29.4%) and 14 as C III (41.2%); none of these patients had any definable non-diabetic renal disease. GFR, AER and blood pressure were similar in the three groups, while HbA1c was higher in C II and C III than in C I patients. Diabetic retinopathy was present in all C II patients (background in 50% and proliferative in 50%). None of the patients in C I and C III had proliferative retinopathy, while background retinopathy was observed in 50% of C I and 57% of C III patients. In summary, microalbuminuric NIDDM patients are structurally heterogeneous with less than one third having \"typical\" diabetic nephropathology. The presence of both \"typical\" and \"atypical\" patterns of renal pathology was associated with worse metabolic control, suggesting that hyperglycaemia may cause different patterns of renal injury in older NIDDM compared to younger IDDM patients.", 
    "485": "We report the efficacy of therapy over 5 years follow-up in 758 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients in a prospective, randomised controlled study of therapy of mild hypertension. Patients were recruited who on antihypertensive therapy had systolic blood pressure over 150 mmHg or diastolic over 85 mmHg, or if not on therapy had systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg or diastolic over 90 mmHg. Their mean blood pressure at entry to the study was 160/94 mmHg at a mean age of 57 years. They were allocated to tight control (aiming for systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or to less tight control (aiming for systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The tight control group were allocated to primary therapy either with a beta blocker (atenolol) or with an antiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), with addition of other agents as required. Over 5 years, the mean blood pressure in the tight control group was significantly lower (143/82 vs 154/88 mmHg, p < 0.001). No difference was seen between those allocated to atenolol or captopril. The proportion of patients requiring three or more antihypertensive therapies to maintain tight control in those allocated to atenolol or captopril increased from 16 and 15%, respectively at 2 years to 25 and 26%, respectively at 5 years, whereas in the less tight control group at 2 and 5 years only 5 and 7%, respectively required three or more therapies. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects or hypoglycaemic episodes between those allocated to atenolol or captopril, but those allocated to atenolol increased their body weight by a mean of 2.3 kg compared with 0.5 kg in those allocated to captopril (p < 0.01). Allocation to atenolol was also associated with small increases in triglyceride, and decreases in LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are of uncertain clinical relevance. The study is continuing to determine whether the improved blood pressure control, which was obtained, will be beneficial in maintaining the health of patients by decreasing the incidence of major clinical complications, principally myocardial infarction and strokes, and microvascular complications, such as severe retinopathy requiring photocoagulation and deterioration of renal function.", 
    "486": "Anginal symptoms alone are not a reliable guide to the extent of patients' ischaemic heart disease and silent episodes of ischaemia are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is becoming apparent that effective treatment of ischaemia will have to target the pattern of ischaemic events seen in patients' daily lives and treatment strategies are now being developed which aim to eliminate both silent and symptomatic episodes of ischaemia over the whole 24-h period. For example, the Circadian Anti-ischaemia Program in Europe (CAPE) trial has shown that significant improvements in objective and subjective measures of ischaemia occurred over 24 h when the once-daily third-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine was added to background medical therapy. In addition, the Canadian Amlodipine/Atenolol in Silent Ischaemia Study (CASIS) has clearly shown the complementary effects of combination therapy with amlodipine and the long-acting beta-blocker atenolol. Ongoing and future outcome studies will determine the impact of such approaches on the prognosis for patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "487": "Angina with left ventricular dysfunction exhibits a wide range of different presentations. Approximately 45% of patients referred for coronary artery bypass surgery have some degree of left ventricular dysfunction and, given that at least a third of those suffering from angina have a history of myocardial infarction, the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction in such patients is likely to be substantial. The major prognostic factor in patients with coronary artery disease is the degree of left ventricular function and it is important to identify those with poor or reduced left ventricular function. High-risk patients, defined by exercise testing and echocardiography, should be considered for revascularization. For the majority of patients management should be medical, consisting of nitrates plus a beta-blocker or calcium antagonist. In severe ischaemia, the combination of these agents has been shown to provide additional efficacy. In patients with heart failure the newer calcium antagonist amlodipine has been shown to have a neutral effect upon survival, indicating that it may be used safely in patients with angina and left ventricular dysfunction. Progression of left ventricular dysfunction may be slowed through the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which have also been shown to improve survival, although they should be used with caution, since there is evidence that ACE inhibitors may worsen angina in some patients.", 
    "488": "This review summarizes the results of several pharmacological interventions that have been evaluated in the management of acute myocardial infarction. Of these, thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have all been proven to reduce mortality risk and the latter three classes of drugs have also been shown to reduce morbidity. Routine use of heparin or nitrates is not recommended although they may be useful in specific circumstances such as post-infarction angina or large infarcts. Drugs that have as yet not been shown to have a role in the routine management of acute myocardial infarction include Class I antiarrhythmic agents, magnesium and calcium antagonists. Management of patients with acute myocardial infarction can now be appropriately based on the evidence generated from well conducted randomized clinical trials and appropriate therapeutic choices based on such information can be expected to reduce their morbidity and mortality risks.", 
    "489": "Although the exact incidence of drug-induced nephrotoxicity is not known, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the risks in certain patients and to know which drugs are the most commonly implicated. The latter include radiocontrast agents, aminoglycosides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Other medications also have nephrotoxic potential when they are prescribed in specific patient populations. Renal injury may be transient and mild in many cases, but recognition of the patient at high risk and application of preventive measures are essential to avoid a severe and protracted course.", 
    "490": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce proteinuria in both normotensive and hypertensive patients with proteinuric renal disease. However, the mechanism of the antiproteinuric effect has not been clarified. We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial to test the hypothesis that the antiproteinuric effect of ramipril was due to an improvement in glomerular permselectivity independent of blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate. The effect of low-dose (1.25 mg/d) and high-dose (5 mg/d) ramipril was assessed in 15 normotensive nondiabetic patients with proteinuria (> 150 mg/d). The study was divided into four 12-week periods: placebo, high- or low-dose ramipril, crossover to low- or high-dose ramipril, and placebo. Blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow rate, urinary protein excretion rate, and plasma angiotensin II levels were measured at the end of each period. Mean arterial pressure, urine protein to creatinine ratio, and albumin excretion rate decreased significantly during low- and high-dose ramipril. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow rate were not changed significantly. Plasma angiotensin II levels decreased with both low- and high-dose ramipril. There were no episodes of hypotension and only one subject developed cough during ramipril that did not require discontinuation of the study drug. In conclusion, administration of ramipril in both low and high doses lowered blood pressure and reduced proteinuria in this cohort of normotensive patients with a variety of proteinuric renal diseases. The antiproteinuric effect of ramipril is probably mediated by a reduction in glomerular capillary pressure.", 
    "491": "The influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on renal tubular function in progressive chronic nephropathy was investigated in 69 patients by the lithium clearance (C(Li)) method. Studies were done repeatedly for up to 2 years during a controlled trial on the effect of enalapril on progression of renal failure. The pattern of proteinuria was followed over the first 9 months. At baseline, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 5 to 68 mL/min. Absolute proximal tubular reabsorption rate of fluid (APR), estimated as the difference between GFR and C(Li), was 1 to 54 mL/min. Calculated fractional proximal reabsorption (FPR) was moderately subnormal. During the study, GFR decreased and sodium clearance was unchanged; fractional excretion of sodium therefore increased. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with enalapril (n = 34), GFR at 1 month was 83% (P < 0.001) and C(Li) was 88% (P < 0.01) of the baseline values, APR and FPR had not changed significantly, and potassium clearance was significantly decreased. Through the rest of the study period, APR remained nearly unchanged and FPR even increased in the enalapril group. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with conventional antihypertensive drugs (n = 35), C(Li) was unchanged until severe reduction in GFR, APR and FPR decreased gradually, and potassium clearance was almost unchanged. These differences in tubular function between the two treatment regimens were significant (P < 0.05). An unchanged or increased APR in either treatment regimen was associated with a long-term slower progression of renal failure. Over 9 months, the 24-hour fractional clearance of albumin decreased in the ACE inhibitor group (P < 0.01), whereas the clearances of immunoglobulin G and retinol-binding protein were unchanged in this group. In the conventional group, the fractional clearances of these three plasma proteins all increased. It is concluded that in progressive chronic nephropathy ACE-inhibitor treatment was associated with different adaptive tubular changes in the handling of sodium, water, and protein compared with conventional antihypertensive therapy. During ACE inhibition, the reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubule appeared to be better preserved, which might be of importance for the beneficial effect of this treatment in chronic renal disease.", 
    "492": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve arterial stiffness independently of blood pressure reduction. Since we have recently shown that in hypertensive individuals the A1166C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) is an independent determinant of aortic stiffness, we designed the present study to assess the influence of this polymorphism on the changes of aortic stiffness after chronic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. Forty perindopril- and 42 nitrendipine-treated hypertensive individuals were studied. We evaluated aortic stiffness by measuring the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Carriers of the AT1-RC allele showed higher baseline values of pulse wave velocity than AA homozygotes (P < .05). In the perindopril group, a threefold greater reduction in pulse wave velocity was observed in carriers of the C allele than in AA homozygotes (-2.85 +/- 0.62 versus -0.94 +/- 0.32 m/s, respectively; P < .001), whereas in the nitrendipine group, pulse wave velocity decreased only in AA homozygotes and not in AT1-R C carriers (-1.38 +/- 0.35 versus +0.04 +/- 0.60 m/s, respectively; P < .01). These results indicate that according to the AT1-R A1166C genotype, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker affect pulse wave velocity in opposite ways. Since some evidence shows that increased pulse wave velocity may enhance cardiovascular risk, it might be useful for physicians to consider the AT1-R genotype when prescribing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker to a hypertensive individual.", 
    "493": "Calcium antagonists have a useful role in the management of patients with cardiac disease, producing coronary and systemic vasodilatation and an additional possibly beneficial effect on ventricular diastolic function. On the other hand, the myocardial depressant effect of the first-generation drugs and the abrupt changes in blood pressure, with neurohormonal activation, have been associated with worsening heart failure in certain patients. The present review summarizes the data currently available, with emphasis on the newer slow-release and long-acting calcium antagonists. Use of these drugs minimizes the peak and trough effect associated with short-acting preparations, and particularly when administered against a background of digoxin, diuretic and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, may be associated with better long-term results in patients with ventricular dysfunction. The DEFIANT studies, using nisoldipine-coat core, showed that nisoldipine-CC improved diastolic ventricular function and had a significant anti-ischemic effect in patients with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction. The VHeFT III trial showed that felodipine had no effect on exercise capacity or survival in patients with Class 2-3 heart failure. In the PRAISE study of Class 3-4 patients, amlodipine was neutral in patients with ischemic disease, but a strikingly beneficial effect was observed in non-ischemic heart failure (45% decrease in mortality). The precise mechanism for the beneficial effect of amlodipine in these patients is unknown. Further studies are needed to examine the issue of survival benefit in patients with non-ischemic heart failure and the mechanisms involved.", 
    "494": "The physiologic trophic factors growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) generally increase body weight and cardiac mass proportionately, and several studies suggest that both growth factors cause vasodilation and increased myocardial contractility. Established clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors can be explained, at least in part, by inhibition of cell hypertrophy, lowered systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and afterload, leading to reduction of progressive left-ventricular (LV) enlargement. An alternative approach would be to administer IGF-1 or GH to stimulate compensatory hypertrophy and reduce afterload by their vasodilator action, as well as through potential favorable effects on myocardial contractility. In our initial study in the rat myocardial infarction (MI) model, when IGF-1 was administered early (at 2 days) post-MI and continued for 2 weeks, body weight (BW) increased and LV weight/BW remained unchanged, the LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and stroke volume increased (but not when normalized to BW), and the LV ejection fraction increased in rats with large infarctions. These findings suggested a beneficial rather than detrimental effect of such treatment, and we then studied the action of combined IGF-1 and GH starting after infarct healing at 4-weeks' post-MI. BW increased substantially and LVEDV/BW was lower in treated rats than in control rats, suggesting relatively less LV dilation with little remodeling in this setting; IGF-1/GH increased the cardiac output by 46%, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fell and the cardiac index (CI) was significantly elevated in treated rats with a large MI. Recently, others have used the rat MI model to study the effects of 2-weeks' of GH started at 4-weeks' post-MI, as well as IGF/GH for 2-weeks in rats treated with an ACE inhibitor for 3-month's post-MI. In both studies, in conscious treated rats the BW increased, LV/BW was not different compared to the control rats, but the CI increased, SVR fell, and estimated LV dP/dtmax was significantly augmented. Preliminary data in our laboratory suggest that beneficial effects may also occur with GH administration in the setting of chronic angiotensin II receptor blockade (losartan) after MI in the rat. Thus, growth factor therapy appears to have favorable effects in heart failure early and late after MI in the rat. Additional cardiac hypertrophy occurs early after MI, but the later beneficial effects appear to relate primarily to systemic vasodilation, improved cardiac output, and enhanced myocardial contractility.", 
    "495": "Cardiac failure is a disease which involves three different mechanisms: (1) the limits and imperfections of the general process of myocardial adaptation to mechanical stress, which includes various changes in genetic expression, including an increased collagen mass, but an unchanged collagen concentration; (2) the limits and imperfections of the adaptational process at the peripheral level which allows the entire organism to adapt to the low cardiac output; (3) fibrosis, an augmented collagen concentration, which is not a direct consequence of mechanical overload, but depends on aging, myocardial ischemia or hormonal changes. Middle-aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) represent a good model of the common clinical situation. Three-month treatment with a CEI reduces, in parallel, arterial hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular fibrosis. Holter monitoring was also performed in these animals. Untreated SHRs when compared to age-matched Wistar rats have an increased number of ventricular premature beats which are suppressed by the treatment. In addition, heart rate variability has been quantified by using the pseudo Wigner-Vill\u00e9 transformation, a time and frequency domain method. The low frequency oscillations are hampered in SHRs. CEI normalizes this parameter.", 
    "496": "Hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy is associated with the accumulation of collagen in the myocardial interstitium. Previous studies have demonstrated that this myocardial fibrosis accounts for impaired myocardial stiffness and ventricular dysfunction. Although cardiac fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis of fibrillar collagen, the factors that regulate collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts are not fully understood. We investigated the effects of angiotensin II on cardiac collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts of 10-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats and age-matched WKY rats. Basal collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts from spontaneously hypertensive rats was 1.6-fold greater than that in the cell of WKY rats. Angiotensin II stimulated collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. The responsiveness of collagen production to angiotensin II was significantly enhanced in cardiac fibroblasts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (100 nM angiotensin II resulted in 185 +/- 18% increase above basal levels, 185 +/- 18 vs 128 +/- 19% in WKY rats, P < .01). This effect was receptor-specific, because it was blocked by the competitive inhibitors saralasin and MK 954. These results indicate that collagen production is enhanced in cardiac fibroblasts from spontaneously hypertensive rats, that angiotensin II has a stimulatory effect on collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts, and that cardiac fibroblasts from spontaneously hypertensive rats are hyper-responsive to stimulation by angiotensin II. In the hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats, mRNA of the renin-angiotensin system (renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme) was expressed. Levels of angiotensinogen and renin mRNA expressed in ventricles, and angiotensinogen mRNA expressed in fibroblasts from SHR were higher than those from WKY. ACE mRNA was also more strongly expressed in the ventricles and fibroblasts from SHR compared with those of WKY. These findings suggest that the cardiac reninangiotensin system may play an important role in collagen accumulation in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy (fig.4).", 
    "497": "Clinical and metabolic studies were performed in four members of a Spanish family with partial (50%) 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) deficiency. In all cases the activities of 6 phosphogluconolactone (6PGL) and glutathione reductase (GR) were normal, and the molecular characterization performed in the partially purified 6PGD from the propositus showed normal kinetic and electrophoretic patterns. Two females (the propositus and her sister) suffered from a well-compensated chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) and exhibited decreased RBC glutathione (GSH) stability with increased oxidative susceptibility, defined by enhanced malonyldialdehyde (MDA) generation \"in vitro.\" The other two members of the family (the propositus's mother and brother) were clinically asymptomatic. In the propositus and her sister, RBC metabolism exhibited a markedly abnormal concentration of glycolytic intermediates, mainly characterized by striking increases in fructose 1,6 bisphosphate (50-fold), dihydroxiacetone-phosphate (20-fold) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (tenfold). Although the precise mechanism of the hemolysis in the two patients is unknown, the enhanced oxidative threat observed in their RBCs may interfere in some way with the glycolytic pathway function, leading to a marked increase in certain metabolic intermediates located before the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GA3PD) step. Since it seems that GA3PD half-life is modulated by fluctuations of the cytosolic redox status, an \"in situ\" approach was simulated by using permeabilized RBCs. In these conditions, GA3PD activity was significantly lower in the propositus and her sister than in the asymptomatic members of the family and the simultaneous normal control.", 
    "498": "The effects of chronic treatment with the specific AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist, irbesartan, or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, were assessed in uninephrectomized fawn-hooded hypertensive rats (FHH) and compared with vehicle treatment. Three days after uninephrectomy, irbesartan (240 mg/liter), enalapril (80 mg/liter) or vehicle were administered via the drinking water. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and protein excretion rates (UprotV) were determined monthly. In rats receiving irbesartan (N = 7) and enalapril (N = 6) SBP (132 +/- 3 mm Hg and 133 +/- 6, respectively) was essentially normalized at 12 weeks when compared with vehicle (169 +/- 6 mm Hg (N = 6); all comparisons were P < 0.05 by ANOVA). Similarly, proteinuria was lower in irbesartan (44 +/- 12 mg/day) and enalapril (19 +/- 2) groups versus vehicle (123 +/- 10 mg/day). Treatment with both drugs was associated with marked reduction in glomerulosclerosis at 12 weeks (both < 5% vs. vehicle, 43 +/- 9%) without effect on glomerular volume. In identically prepared rats, glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC, estimated from stop-flow pressure, Psf) was lower in FHH receiving irbesartan (58 +/- 1 mm Hg, N = 6) or enalapril (54 +/- 2, N = 6) than in vehicle-treated rats, in whom PGC was greatly elevated (68 +/- 2 mm Hg; N = 7). Despite this, GFR and single nephron GFR were well maintained. These data support a critical role for AT1 receptor-mediated, angiotensin-dependent processes in the pathogenesis of hypertension in FHH, and further implicate elevated PGC as a major determinant of glomerular injury in this model.", 
    "499": "Long-term unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) initiates a series of renal events leading to proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts and proliferation/repair of tubular cells. This is evidenced by significant increases in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive nuclei during UUO. Several pathologic settings requiring DNA replication and/or DNA repair are dependent upon the expression of p53 and at least one of two p53-dependent proteins, termed p21 (also called WAF1) and GADD45. We therefore sought to determine if p53, p21 (WAF1) or GADD45 mRNA levels were changed in obstruction. There was a progressive increase in the amount of p53 mRNA and p21 (WAF1) mRNA at 1, 3, 5 and 8 days of continuous UUO. The amount of GADD45 mRNA was found not to change. Treatment of the experimental animals with an ACE inhibitor on day 4 through day 8 of UUO significantly blunted the increase in p53 and p21 (WAF1) expression. ACE inhibitor treatment also significantly decreased the number of PCNA-positive renal cell nuclei during UUO. These results suggest that during ureteral obstruction the p53 and p21 (WAF1) genes are activated. ACE inhibitor treatment reduces p53 and p21 (WAF1) expression. This reduction is at least in part due to an inhibition of interstitial cell proliferation.",

However, the pulsatile component of hemodynamic load has not been evaluated in this model.", 
    "501": "We measured pulsatile hemodynamics in 18-month-old male SHR after 6 months of therapy with either zofenopril (Z), hydralazine (H), or water (W). Hydralazine and zofenopril reduced mean arterial pressure comparably (W, 106 +/- 23 versus H, 81 +/- 12 versus Z, 84 +/- 18 mm Hg, P = .002) yet had a differential effect on the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight (W, 3.9 +/- 0.5 versus H, 3.3 +/- 0.4 versus Z, 2.4 +/- 0.2 g/kg, P < .005). Hydralazine-treated SHR had increased characteristic impedance (P = .0011) and a persistently low ratio of the reflected-wave transit time to left ventricular ejection time (P < .001), which contributed to early and late systolic loading, respectively, of the left ventricle. Consequently, only zofenopril-treated SHR had a significant reduction in left ventricular systolic force-time integral (P = .02), a measure of total ventricular load. There were no differences in systolic stress-time integral, suggesting that mass was appropriate to load when all elements of steady-flow and pulsatile load were considered.",

Fosinopril therapy was begun 6 weeks after banding and was continued until week 21 after banding, when the animals were killed. Collagenase-dissociated myocytes loaded with indo 1-AM were paced at 3 Hz at 36 degrees C and superfused at [Ca2+]o of 0.6, 1.2, and 3.0 mmol/L. In myocytes from untreated aortic-banded rats, peak systolic [Ca2+]i was higher than in control myocytes, and the relationship between myocyte shortening and [Ca2+]i was depressed relative to control myocytes, implicating impaired responsiveness to Ca2+. Long-term fosinopril treatment improved both myocyte shortening and the relationship of shortening to [Ca2+]i (P < .05 versus myocytes from untreated aortic-banded rats). Maximal Ca(2+)-activated force was depressed in chemically skinned left ventricular fibers from untreated aortic-banded hypertrophied rats relative to age-matched controls but not in the fosinopril-treated aortic-banded rats.",

The primary end point was clinical progression, defined as death due to heart failure, hospitalization for heart failure, or a sustained increase in heart failure medications. Clinical progression of heart failure occurred in 21% of placebo patients and 11% of carvedilol patients, reflecting a 48% (P = .008) reduction in the primary end point of heart failure progression (relative risk, 0.52; CI, 0.32 to 0.85). This effect of carvedilol was not influenced by sex, age, race, cause of heart failure, or baseline LVEF. Carvedilol also significantly improved several secondary end points, including LVEF, heart failure score, NYHA functional class, and the physician and patient global assessments. Carvedilol reduced all-cause mortality but had no effects on the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure scale, the distance walked in 9 minutes on a self-powered treadmill, or cardiothoracic index.

Compared with placebo, patients in the carvedilol group had a greater frequency of symptomatic improvement and lower risk of clinical deterioration, as evaluated by changes in the NYHA functional class (P = .014) or by a global assessment of progress judged either by the patient (P = .002) or by the physician (P < .001). In addition, treatment with carvedilol was associated with a significant increase in ejection fraction (P < .001) and a significant decrease in the combined risk of morbidity and mortality (P = .029).

In nonatherosclerotic arteries, ACE immunoreactivity was found in luminal and adventitial vasa vasorum endothelium. In early- and intermediate-stage atherosclerotic lesions, ACE was detected prominently in regions of fat-laden macrophages and in association with T lymphocytes. In advanced lesions, ACE immunoreactivity was also localized to the endothelium of the microvasculature throughout the plaques. Immunoreactive angiotensin II was also detected in these areas. ACE expression in macrophages was further examined by in vitro experiments with a monocytoid cell line. ACE activity was induced threefold after differentiation of the cells into macrophages and was further increased after stimulation with acetylated LDL.",

In 1993/1994, 15 microalbuminuric patients (age: 10-17 yrs, diabetes duration: 6.5 +/- 3.0 yrs) had been treated with captopril (0.9 mg/kg/day for a period of 13.1 +/- 4.4 months). In 1992/1993, 13 patients (age: 11-17 yrs, diabetes duration: 5.8 +/- 2.7 yrs, study period: 12.3 +/- 4.0 months) had not received captopril. Same restriction of the dietary protein intake was recommended in both groups (less than 10% of the total calorie intake). Timed 24-h urine samples were used to determine albumin excretion by an immunonephelometric method. Significant increase in microalbuminuria was observed in patients who had not received captopril during the study period (56.2 +/- 16.0 mg/24 h vs. 77.8 +/- 20.1 mg/24 h, p = 0.045). There was no change in microalbuminuria in the captopril treated group during the study period (60.6 +/- 19.5 mg/24 h vs. 60.4 +/- 25 mg/24 h, n. s.). No change in metabolic control and blood pressure was observed in the two groups during the study period.

    "521": "To investigate how the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) might be involved in cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis, we studied the effects of a nonsulhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, E-4177, in cholesterol fed rabbits. Japanese white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups with the following dietary regimens: group A (n = 8) received a standard diet; group B (n = 8) had a 0.5% cholesterol diet; group C (n = 8) had a 0.5% cholesterol diet plus enalapril (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.); group D (n = 8) received a 0.5% cholesterol diet plus E-4177 (20 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and were fed these diets for 5 weeks. Enalapril or E-4177 had no significant effect on either the total plasma or the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. However, the aortic cholesterol content in groups C and D was equally significantly less than that in group B. The plasma and aortic ACE activities were significantly reduced only in group C compared with those in the other groups. The aortic ACE mRNA and AT1 mRNA levels were assessed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The aortic ACE mRNA level was only significantly less in group C than in any of the other groups. The aortic AT1 mRNA level increased significantly in group B compared with that in group A and was significantly and equally reduced in both groups C and D compared with that in group B. These data indicate that angiotensin II rather than ACE may therefore be related to aortic cholesterol content. It follows therefore that the inhibition of angiotensin II by either ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II (type 1) receptor antagonist may play a role in prevention of atherosclerosis.", 
    "522": "Chagasic patients with congestive heart failure are usually treated with digitalis and converting enzyme inhibitors. According to the neurogenic and dysautonomic theories, chagasic patients would not benefit from these drugs. To clarify this controversial issue, we have studied patients with congestive heart failure and suspected Chagas' heart disease. All patients received intravenous methyl-digoxin for 24 h and oral enalapril for 96 h. Blood samples for plasma norepinephrine, aldosterone and renin were taken at baseline, after acute digitalization and following enalapril. Based on the serology for Chagas' disease, the patients were divided into non-chagasic and chagasic patients. In the chagasic group three patients were in functional class III and 3 were in functional class IV. In the non-chagasic group five patients were in functional class III and 2 were in functional class IV. Both groups had a marked and quantitatively similar degree of neurohormonal activation. All patients improved at least one functional class and lost more than 5 kg of body weight with treatment. The chagasic patients had a statistically significant reduction in plasma norepinephrine (2262 +/- 1407 to 865 +/- 390, P < 0.008, pg/ml, M +/- S.D.), plasma aldosterone (330 +/- 168 to 155 +/- 75, P < 0.01, pg/ml, M +/- S.D.) and plasma renin activity (14 +/- 13 to 2 +/- 1.6 ng/ml per h, M +/- S.D., P < 0.05), with digitalis. Following enalapril, norepinephrine and aldosterone there was a further but non-significant reduction, when compared to postdigitalis values. These results indicated that chagasic patients do benefit from digitalis and enalapril. Furthermore, the prominent and significant reduction in all three neurohormones suggest that the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems of these chagasic and non-chagasic patients, are responding to the neuromodulatory effects of digitalis and enalapril.",

These %IS/AR values were not significantly different between the three groups. However, a combination of captopril and subsequent preconditioning with 2 min of ischemia markedly limited %IS/AR to 21.2 +/- 2.4%. This potentiation of 2 min of preconditioning by captopril was not observed when 2 micrograms/kg body weight of Hoe 140, a specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, was administered before preconditioning (%IS/AR = 41.2 +/- 5.7%), whereas Hoe 140 alone did not modify infarct size (%IS/AR = 38.5 +/- 5.1%). Arterial plasma kinin levels were comparable between the control rabbits, the group given captopril alone and the group that received captopril plus 2 min of preconditioning at baseline (3.8 +/- 1.0, 6.3 +/- 1.9 and 5.2 +/- 1.7 pg/ml, respectively), and there was no significant change in kinin levels after the captopril injection or the combination of captopril plus 2 min of preconditioning.",

    "534": "An increasing number of ACE inhibitors have become available in recent years. Because these agents are all similar, careful scrutiny is required in order to determine specific advantages of particular agents when making formulary decisions. Differences between agents with regard to structure and tissue specificity have been identified, but the clinical relevance of these differences is not clear. ACE inhibitors vary greatly with regard to bioconversion, distribution and elimination. Disease states such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and hepatic or renal insufficiency may affect the disposition of specific ACE inhibitors. These agents may differ substantially in duration of action, and ACE inhibitors that are given once daily may optimise patient compliance and decrease costs. ACE inhibitors have been extensively studied in patients with hypertension, CHF or nephropathy, and following myocardial infarction (MI). Differences in efficacy between agents are often a result of variations in study design, or because nonequipotent dosages were compared. It is likely that the benefits of ACE inhibitors are class effects, and it is probably reasonable to use an agent even if large scale clinical trials have not been performed with that particular drug. Few differences have been found between ACE inhibitors with regard to adverse effects or drug interactions, and these factors are of minor importance when making formulary decisions. Cost and availability may vary among agents, and will depend on geographical location and institution-specific purchasing contracts. ACE inhibitors have shown positive effects on quality of life when compared with agents of other classes. Quality-of-life studies that have directly compared ACE inhibitors have produced conflicting results. In the setting of hypertension, cost-effectiveness evaluations typically find that the newer, longer-acting ACE inhibitors provide the greatest financial benefit. Differences in cost effectiveness in the post-MI patient population are typically the result of variations in protocol design, including duration of treatment and nondrug costs. ACE inhibitors are fairly homogeneous and selection between agents can be difficult. Clinical efficacy, time course of action, and cost are the primary concerns in selecting agents for inclusion on a formulary.",

The injection volume was always 1 microliter and was injected over a period of 30-60 sec. Control animals were injected with 0.15 M NaCl. After the injection of isotonic saline (control, 0.15 M NaCl) into the 3rdV, water ingestion was 0.3 +/- 0.1 ml/h. Ramipril (1 mircogram/microliter) injected into the 3rdV prior to isotonic saline produced no changes in water ingestion (0.4 +/- 0.2 ml/h). The injection of noradrenaline (40 nmol/microliter) after isotonic saline induced an increase in water intake (3.0 +/- 1.1 ml/h). The prior injection of ramipril decreased this ingestion to 1.8 +/- 0.3 ml/h. These data show that the inhibition of converting enzyme in the brain reduces the water intake induced by catecholaminergic stimulation. We conclude that the brain is able to transform the prodrug ramipril into the active drug ramiprilat.",

The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of enalapril on short and medium follow-up in patients with symptomatic VSD and Qp/Qs ratio > 1.5 and compare the results with conventional anti-congestive treatment in children. Twenty-four patients with ages from 3 months to 8 years were studied, dividing them in 3 groups of 8 patients each. Group I received treatment with enalapril, group II with furosemide an digoxin, and group III was treated with a combination of the three medicaments. Patients were evaluated after one, three and six months. Evaluation considered clinical signs of congestive failure, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiothoracic index, and with echocardiography the dimensions of the cardiac chambers, size of the VSD and hemodynamic parameters as Qp/Qs, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), systolic pressure gradient over the VSD, EF and SF. Statistic analysis was done for each group and was compared the three groups. The results demonstrated significant weight gain (p > 0.05) in the three groups. A decrease in heart rate, Qp/Qs and PAP was observed in group III, however without statistic significance. No side effects were observed.

    "560": "Effectiveness of antihypertensive agents is assessed not only by systemic blood pressure levels, but by multiple parameters that reflect specific organ functions. Among antihypertensive agents, those which inhibit angiotensin actions show particular efficacy in ameliorating end organ damage. This efficacy likely reflects the central role that angiotensin has in regulating renal function by its multifaceted actions. We will therefore focus on the renin angiotensin system, and compare its actions on parameters of renal injury with other antihypertensive treatment approaches.", 
    "561": "Clinical and experiments study with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors suggest that these agents may improve coronary artery disease by acting at multiple sites in the series of events leading to end-stage heart disease. These agents reduce blood pressure, improve prognosis and symptoms in patients with severe heart failure and in patients after acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction. They are useful in the early, acute phase of myocardial infarction. More recently, ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce in vitro vascular hypertrophy, to attenuate arteriosclerosis, and to maintain endothelium function. Whether these effects occur at clinical levels is still uncertain. The exciting clinical data have led to the proposal that alteration of ACE activity, particularly in tissue, is an important factor in development and progression of CAD. The ACE system is complex, with endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects. ACE is present in cardiac and vascular tissue. Therefore, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors can be classified as \"cardio\" and \"vasculo\" protective. This article summarizes a number of independent and complementary mechanisms pointing to a role of ACE and ACE inhibition in coronary artery disease.", 
    "562": "The renin-angiotensin system and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are increasingly being implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and its sequelae. Genetic studies of ACE gene polymorphism hint at an association between the ACE genotype and atherosclerosis. Animal studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of ACE inhibition at a variety of sites, including improvement of endothelial function, inhibition of platelet aggregation, reduction of atherosclerosis, and inhibition of myointimal proliferation. Although these have not all been validated in human studies, the reduction of ischemic events in studies of ACE inhibition in left ventricular dysfunction cannot be explained solely by improved hemodynamics, and it is possible that actions on the endothelium, the atherosclerotic process, and platelets are at least in part responsible. The results of studies in humans looking more directly at the influence of ACE inhibitors on atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease are awaited.", 
    "563": "Congestive heart failure is a lethal condition that affects an increasing number of patients. In recent years a great amount of data have accumulated on the pathophysiology and medical and surgical therapy of this condition. In spite of the advances in its management and the great number of patients affected, common errors are still made by internists and cardiologists in the use of drugs and therapeutic strategies. Digitalis has only recently been shown to affect hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and clinical symptoms, but the effects on survival still have to be demonstrated. Loop diuretics, eventually combined with thiazides and antialdosterone drugs in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of fluid retention, are the mainstays of therapy of congestive heart failure. In order to make diuretic therapy efficacious, moderate salt and water intake restriction is mandatory. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now considered unavoidable drugs in the management of heart failure, and an attempt to reach the doses that have been shown to be efficacious for survival in the large trials has to be made in every patient with this condition. Other vasodilators, such as hydralazine and nitrates, which show a less pronounced effect on survival but more effective hemodynamic actions than ACE inhibitors, may be used to control mitral insufficiency or to improve hemodynamics in very sick patients. Hemodynamic instability refractory to increasing doses of vasodilators and diuretics is a severe condition that requires hospital admission to administer drugs parenterally. These patients are usually treated with the combination of catecholamines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors associated with intravenous diuretics until clinical stability is again achieved and oral therapy is resumed and restructured. The use of aggressive pharmacological therapy and phosphodiesterase inhibitors has reduced the need for assisted circulatory support in these patients. Beta-blockers have shown promising results when administered to patients with heart failure, although a definitive demonstration of their effects on survival is still lacking. Other additional measures that need to be considered in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulation.", 
    "564": "Coronary heart disease is a multifactorial disease, influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Experimental and clinical data show that the renin-angiotensin system has important indications in coronary artery disease by influencing progressive ventricular dilatation, ventricular function, and outcome. Angiotensin II may have direct toxic effects on myocardial cells, induce hypertrophy in noninfarcted areas, activate the sympathetic nervous system, stimulate fibroblast proliferation, vasoconstrict coronary vessels, increase left ventricular afterload, and impair diastolic relaxation. Associations between a polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene and angiotensin-converting enzyme gene and the occurrence of myocardial infarction have been reported. Patients with the DD genotype (ACE gene) have higher plasma ACE and myocardial ACE activity. Preliminary data suggest that the DD genotype is associated with more progressive ventricular dilatation post myocardial infarction and with a greater response after ACE inhibition. The DD genotype is also associated with a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, which may have implications for the induction of hypertrophy in noninfarcted areas. Whatever the mechanisms, chronic ACE inhibition, started early after myocardial infarction, improves survival and reduces mortality and morbidity for major cardiovascular events.", 
    "565": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have played a highly beneficial role in the therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Detailed analysis of some of the heart failure trials in patients with these diseases has uncovered unexpected benefits in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Paralleling these observations are the rapidly accruing basic studies describing important molecular and cellular effects of these agents. For example, ACE inhibition will prevent stimulation of smooth muscle cell angiotensin II receptors, thereby blocking both contractile and proliferative actions. In addition, ACE inhibition of kininase II inhibits the breakdown of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a direct stimulant of nitric oxide release from the intact endothelial cell. Thus, at the cellular level ACE inhibition shifts the balance of ongoing mechanisms in favor of those promoting vasodilatory, antiaggregatory, antithrombotic, and antiproliferative effects. These effects underlie the potential benefits of ACE inhibition in the therapy of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis.",

The effect of dietary protein intake on urinary protein losses and albumin homeostasis are discussed on the basis of the pathophysiologic mechanisms known to account for changes in renal function of nephrotic patients. In addition, the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for reduction of proteinuria is discussed in terms of the modulation of glomerular permselectivity and hemodynamics.", 
    "567": "The lack of consensus concerning the diagnostic criteria of cardiac failure explains the relative paucity of epidermiological data. Most of the available information comes from American health registers and the Framingham study: in the United States, there are more than 3 million people with cardiac failure (over 1% of the population) and over 400,000 new patients each year. Cardiac failure is the main cause of death in 40,000 deaths and an associated cause in a further 250,000 deaths. In the Framingham study (1948-1988) the mean survival time after diagnosis is 1.7 year in men and 3.2 years in women, corresponding to 1 and 5 year survival rates of 57% and 25% in men and 64% and 38% in women. These figures are worse than those of the large scale therapeutic trials of the last 10 years and represent survival of the most severe cases. Although not strictly epidemiological data, analysis of the large scale trials allows evaluation of the clinical features and survival of patients under optimal medical treatment (ACE inhibitors associated with other treatments): these results are important to bear in mind when considering alternative therapies (transplantation, mechanical assist devices), the accessibility of which may be limited for reasons of availability or cost. In terms of public health, it is important that accurate epidemiological data concerning cardiac failure. In particular severe cardiac failure, is made available in France.", 
    "568": "Terminal cardiac failure, despite the gain obtained by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, continues to carry a high annual mortality. Cardiac transplantation, with a 1 year survival of about 80% (a result which is sustained at 5 years), constitutes the treatment of choice for these patients. However, in view of the contraindications to transplantation and the cruel lack of donors organs, many cases of terminal cardiac failure are unable to benefit from transplantation. What are the pharmacological means available for these patients? This is a real therapeutic challenge. The essential objective in the management of these patients with a poor short-term prognosis is the reduction of mortality. However, this aim is not easily attained, at least in the short or medium-term in the present state of our knowledge. Other objectives can therefore by legitimately considered in the management of patients with cardiac failure in the terminal phase: the most important ones are to improve symptomatology and the quality of life. Terminal cardiac failure is a complex syndrome implicating a number of non-cardiac abnormalities. They may not only participate in the symptomatology and high mortality, but also make therapeutic management a delicate operation. Nevertheless, the abnormalities of cardiovascular function remain the cardinal problem. The treatment which we use aims to correct them. The authors propose a review of the possibilities available with reference to data in the medical literature.", 
    "569": "Although there is undoubtedly a link between ventricular dysfunction and heart failure the interrelationship is complex. Most patients with left ventricular dysfunction die before progression to heart failure. Heart failure is not preceded by a period of chronic left ventricular dysfunction for the large number of patients who develop heart failure soon after a myocardial infarction. Atrial fibrillation and myocardial ischaemia/infarction need to be considered as mechanisms of progression as well as left ventricular remodelling. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, but not diuretics or digoxin, may alter progression to and of heart failure. Potential adverse effects of aspirin on prognosis in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease are cause for considerable concern.", 
    "570": "The present study was undertaken to study the effects of chronic treatment with lisinopril on the cardiovascular complications in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic and deoxycorticosteroneacetate (DOCA) hypertensive rats. Injection of STZ produced severe glycosuria (> 2%), hyperglycemia, hypoinsulnaemia, polydypsia, polyphagia and loss of body weight. It also produced hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypertension, bradycardia and decreased left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP). Elevation in serum creatinine level and increased activity of liver enzymes were also found in STZ treated animals. DOCA by itself did not produce any change in blood glucose but reduced serum insulin levels in non-diabetic animals. However, in the diabetic group, DOCA reduced blood sugar levels. Treatment of STZ-diabetic rats with DOCA did not aggravate cardiac depression or hyperglycaemia. Treatment of rats with lisinopril (1 mg kg-1, p.o. daily for six weeks), in diabetic and diabetic hypertensive animals prevented STZ induced loss of body weight and hypertension, bradycardia and hypothyroidism. It also prevented STZ induced hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinaemia in both diabetic and diabetic hypertensive animals. There was a reduction in cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL levels; the ratio between total cholesterol to HDL and LDL to HDL and an improvement in LVDP at higher filling pressure in diabetic as well as diabetic hypertensive animals. Treatment with lisinopril also prevented hypertrophy and elevated levels of serum creatinine, SGOT and SGPT in diabetic animals. In conclusion, the present data suggests that STZ-DOCA model may not be considered as the ideal model for the study of cardiovascular complications of combined treatment hypertension and diabetes. However, the present investigation presents a number of beneficial effects of lisinopril treatment in diabetic with or without hypertensive rats and it may be considered as one of the drugs of choice in treatment of hypertension when it is associated with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "571": "The hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of single and multiple doses of intravenous quinaprilat were assessed and compared with placebo in a double-blind design. The study group included 50 patients aged between 33 and 76 years with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. The patients were randomized into three treatment groups to receive low (0.5 and 1.0 mg), medium (1.0 and 2.5 mg), or high (5.0 and 10.0 mg) intravenous doses of quinaprilat or placebo on day 1, and, based on the responses, q6h on two further days. The hemodynamic parameters were determined by right-heart catheterization. Quinaprilat is the active metabolite of quinapril, an ACE inhibitor with high affinity for the angiotensin converting enzyme, which is formulated for oral application. Compared with placebo, single and multiple doses of quinaprilat increased cardiac index by 25% (p < 0.05) and simultaneously decreased both peripheral vascular resistance by 25% (p < 0.05) and left ventricular filling pressures by 33% (p < 0.05). There was a dose-related decrease in mean right atrial pressure by 47% (p < 0.05) without significant heart rate changes (-3-5 bpm). The mean artery pressure showed a dose-related maximum decrease of 4-9 mm Hg 45-60 min after single-dose quinaprilat and of 7-10 mm Hg (p < 0.05) after repetitive dosing. Maximum changes were observed 15-90 min after drug application. The hemodynamic changes after multiple-dose quinaprilat were similar to those observed following single doses and generally persisted during the total observation period of 6 h. Compared with placebo, quinaprilat reduced ACE activity and angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations, and increased plasma renin activity. There were no significant changes with regard to plasma catecholamines and the atrial natriuretic factor, although a slight decrease could be observed. The study results obtained in patients with advanced heart failure support both the safety and favorable hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of intravenous quinaprilat over an observation period of 3 days.", 
    "572": "Previous studies have shown that serotonin plays an important role in hypertension because of its vasoconstrictive effect, mediated through serotonergic receptors. Angiotensin-II is a potent vasopressor which facilitates the aggregation of platelets, subsequently releases serotonin. Because quinapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and could result in a decrease of angiotensin-II, Quinapril was used to treat patients with mild or moderate hypertension in order to observe the change of plasma serotonin.", 
    "573": "Twenty-two patients, (10 males, 12 females, mean age 45 yrs) without other major medical diseases and secondary causes of hypertension, were selected for this study. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection was used to detect the plasma serotonin. These patients were given placebos for two weeks before the first dose of quinapril (5 mg). Thereafter, the dosage was adjusted according to the response of blood pressure to a desired value (BP < 140/90 mmHg). At about 14:00 hours on the first day, after the patient had rested for an hour and was in a quiet condition, blood was drawn by venipuncture with heparin as anti coagulant; the plasma serotonin concentration was determined for the baseline value. The plasma serotonin level was rechecked eight weeks later.", 
    "574": "It was found that systolic blood pressure began to decrease significantly two weeks after quinapril therapy, and then reached a constant state. Blood pressure decreased from 174/107 mmHg to 134/87 mmHg. Among these 22 patients, there were 14 (65%) whose blood pressure reduced to a normal range. Plasma serotonin also decreased significantly from 4.69 +/- /3.67 ng/ ml to 2.89 +/-2.64 ng/ml (p < 0.05). According to this data, 15 in 22 patients (68%) had reduction of plasma serotonin. There was little correlation between change in blood pressure and change of plasma serotonin; the correlation co-efficiency is only 0.019.",

Fibrinolytic drugs, ACE inhibitors, new antiplatelet drugs or new tools in the field of interventional cardiology have been studied and have changed the daily practice of the cardiologists. Several remarks and comments are proposed with regards of these trials.", 
    "577": "Both enalapril and long-acting diltiazem have been shown to effectively lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients. Furthermore, in clinical studies, these two agents provided beneficial renal effects in these patients when administered on a long-term basis. A combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER was evaluated in 62 patients with Stage 1-3 hypertension and coexisting renal disease. This trial used a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group design. The study consisted of a 12-week double-blind phase followed by a 6-month open-label extension phase. The combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER was shown to reduce BP following both short-term and long-term treatment phases. Patients in Renal Group I (creatinine clearance CrCl): 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) had decreases of -18/-16 and -25/-20 mm Hg after 12 weeks and 9 months of therapy, respectively. Those in Renal Group II (CrCl: 10-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) had similar decreases of -23/-18 and -23/-19 mm Hg at these time points. The adverse events, in both phases, were those associated with the respective monotherapies. A reduction in CrCl with a coincident decrease in proteinuria was noted for both renal groups. The combination of enalapril/diltiazem ER lowered BP and was generally well tolerated by the patients. The combination of these two agents should improve the management of hypertensive patients.", 
    "578": "This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study to determine if indomethacin attenuates the hypotensive effect of trandolapril. Twenty-three hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-115) requiring NSAID were recruited. Seventeen completed the study. Three week treatment periods: trandolapril 2 mg od and indomethacin 25 mg tds, trandolapril 2 mg and placebo, indomethacin and placebo, placebo and placebo. Clinic and ambulatory BP after 3 weeks of each treatment. Study had 85% power to detect a 5 mm Hg difference in BP (s.d. 7 mm Hg). End of treatment clinic BPs were: 152.9/98 mm Hg (95% CI 147.2, 158.6/95.8, 101.4) with placebo and placebo; 150.4/94.9 mm Hg (95% CI 144.7, 156.1/92.1, 97.7) with trandolapril and indomethacin; 148.2/96.5 mm Hg (95% CI 142.5, 153.9/93.7, 99.3) with trandolapril and placebo; and 156.6/97.4 mm Hg (95% CI 150.9, 162.3/94.6, 100.2) with indomethacin and placebo. There were no significant interactions between trandolapril and indomethacin for clinic systolic BP (SBP) (P = 0.79) or clinic DBP (P = 0.87). When trandolapril treatments (placebo or with indomethacin) were compared to treatments without trandolapril (placebo or indomethacin), trandolapril lowered clinic SBP by 5.4 mm Hg (P = 0.047) and DBP by 2.3 mm Hg (P = 0.08). Mean ambulatory BP was: 140.6/88.2 mm Hg (trandolapril and placebo); 142.8/89.7 mm Hg (trandolapril and indomethacin); 149.6/95.0 mm Hg, (indomethacin and placebo); 147.7/94.0 mm Hg (placebo and placebo). Compared with placebo, trandolapril and placebo lowered BP by 6.5/7.5 mm Hg (P < 0.001, SBP; P < 0.001, DBP). Compared with indomethacin, trandolapril and indomethacin lowered BP by 5.0/5.5 mm Hg (P = 0.001, SBP; P < 0.001, DBP). In the present study trandolapril 2 mg lowered clinic SBP and ambulatory BP, but indomethacin did not attenuate this. Indomethacin had no significant effect on either clinic or ambulatory BP. The antihypertensive effects of trandolapril in this study were modest. Patient selection factors may have contributed to the observed responses, but it seems unlikely from these data that a clinically important drug interaction has occurred.", 
    "579": "Antihypertensive medication noncompliance is common and leads to substantial morbidity for patients and increased health care costs for managed-care organizations. A retrospective cohort study using pharmacy prescription profiles to estimate noncompliance was conducted to determine important risk factors for patient noncompliance with antihypertensive therapy for Medicaid enrollees participating in a managed-care plan. The pharmacy and claims data for 1395 patients with uncomplicated hypertension who were enrollees of Tennessee's Medicaid managed-care program were analyzed to determine the frequency of the enrollees' failure to obtain timely antihypertensive medication refills (hereafter referred to as refill failure) and to identify the predictors of refill failure. Overall, refill failure occurred in 33% of 7413 refill opportunities studied, whereas refill failure occurred in 32% of the cases in which medication was dosed once daily and in 35% of the cases in which medication was dosed more than once daily. For patients taking alpha-blockers, there was a significantly lower rate of refill failure (11.0%) than for patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, direct vasodilators, and thiazide diuretics. Patients taking calcium channel blockers, had a significantly lower rate of refill failure (38.5%) than for patients taking thiazide diuretics (45.5%). Younger age, medication class, multiple-daily dosing regimen, and fewer provider visits were all found to be significant independent predictors of refill failure, whereas gender and regimen complexity were not significant predictors in this population. Health care systems planning pharmacy-based interventions to improve patient compliance with antihypertensive medication for patients in a Medicaid managed-care program can expect to encounter high levels of refill failure and may want to target enrollee subgroups by age, medication class, or dosing regimen for intensive intervention efforts.", 
    "580": "This multicenter, double-masked, randomized, parallel-group study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, benazepril 20 mg, and placebo in patients with essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period, 308 patients (all white) were randomized to treatment groups and took medication once daily for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in the 23- to 26-hour period after dosing. Patients wore a noninvasive blood pressure monitor for 24 hours before randomization and before the final visit. Investigators recorded adverse experiences at randomization and at study weeks 4 and 8, and obtained specimens for laboratory testing at randomization and at study week 8. Three hundred seven patients were evaluated for efficacy, and 308 for tolerability and safety. At end point (the last postrandomization measurement for each patient), the reduction in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure with the amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg treatment was statistically significantly greater than with any comparative therapy. The results of 24-hour monitoring showed that the amlodipine/benazepril treatment, unlike monotherapy, maintained the hourly mean diastolic blood pressure at < or = 90 mm Hg. A responder rate of 87.0% was observed with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg versus 67.5%, 53.3%, and 15.8% with amlodipine, benazepril, and placebo, respectively. This difference between the amlodipine/benazepril treatment group and each comparative single-agent treatment group was statistically significant. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 15.6% of patients in the amlodipine/benazepril group and in 24.7%, 6.5%, and 11.7% of patients in the amlodipine, benazepril, and placebo groups, respectively. Edema occurred less often in the amlodipine/benazepril group than in the amlodipine group. Overall, once-daily therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg provided an antihypertensive effect that was statistically and clinically superior to amlodipine 5 mg alone, benazepril 20 mg alone, and placebo, was well tolerated, and was associated with less edema than the amlodipine treatment.", 
    "581": "Ramipril, a once-a-day angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was studied in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension in 240 patients. A total of 194 patients (111 women and 83 men; mean +/- SD age, 46.0 +/- 11.5 years) were considered assessable for study. After a 2-week placebo washout phase, all patients received ramipril 2.5 mg once daily for 4 weeks. At 4 weeks, blood pressure was evaluated for response to therapy. Responders to 2.5 mg were continued on the same dose; nonresponders received 5 mg once daily for another 4 weeks. Results showed that 91% of patients responded after 8 weeks of therapy, 60% to 2.5 mg and 31% to 5 mg. Ramipril was well tolerated and, because of its long half-life, can be considered a true once-a-day angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "582": "Blockade of angiotensin II receptors was first achieved in the 1970s using a peptide, saralasin acetate. Although it was effective in lowering blood pressure, it required parenteral administration and had a short duration of action and partial agonist activity. These disadvantages are absent with losartan, a selective, orally administered, nonpeptide blocker of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor that recently became available for clinical use. Losartan has a sustained duration of action, permitting once-daily dosing in many patients, and lacks partial agonist activity. More than 3300 hypertensive patients have received losartan in Phase III, controlled clinical trials. Losartan given concomitantly with a low dose (12.5 mg) of hydrochlorothiazide further reduces blood pressure. Its overall incidence of adverse experiences is similar to that of placebo. Because of its efficacy, specificity, duration of action, and safety profile, losartan should be considered as first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with hypertension.", 
    "583": "Alteration of pancreatic secretion could be a pathogenetic factor for generation of an acute pancreatitis after administration of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Therefore in 6 conscious dogs (weight 10-12 kg) with chronic gastric and duodenal fistulas according to Thomas, we studied single-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized the effect of a long-term (74 d) daily oral administration of 5 mg of the ACE inhibitor enalapril and of additionally daily oral administration of the diuretic furosemide from the 60th day on the secretin- (20.5 pmol/kg/h) and caerulein- (7.4, 14.8, 29.6, 59, and 118 pmol/kg/h) stimulated pancreatic bicarbonate and protein secretion at day 1, 29, 57, 60, and 74 after beginning of enalapril administration. Heart rate was measured daily and during the experiments. Neither enalapril nor enalapril plus furosemide significantly altered heart rate. The hormonally stimulated pancreatic bicarbonate secretion was significantly (p < 0.05) increased at day 57, 60, and 74 by 353%, 397%, and 79%. The hormonally stimulated pancreatic protein secretion was also distinctly increased, although not reaching statistical significance. The present study shows, that a long-term administration of therapeutic doses of enalapril +/-furosemide is capable to enhance the pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. Whether this altered pancreatic secretion can be taken for a primary origin of the observed cases of acute pancreatitis after therapeutic administration of enalapril is uncertain but not refutable.", 
    "584": "BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION AND CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY: Several hypertension trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment can reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality accompanying this condition. They have also shown, however, that the reduction does not entirely normalize the risk of hypertensive patients. STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THE BENEFIT OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT: Although some of the risk of the hypertensive patient may prove to be irreversible, pathophysiological and clinical evidence obtained in recent years suggests that some modifications to antihypertensive treatment strategies might increase the benefit. For example, greater use of drugs such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-line agents might bring greater benefits, because some properties of these drugs which are additive to their blood pressure lowering effects, such as regression of cardiovascular structural changes, nephroprotection and delay of atherogenesis, may provide a degree of protection against target-organ damage. ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE INTERNATIONAL NIFEDIPINE (GITS) GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM STUDY OF INTERVENTION AS A GOAL IN HYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT (INSIGHT): Several ongoing clinical trials are aimed at comparing the effects of calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors versus beta-blockers and diuretics on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. INSIGHT is particularly interesting because the effects of nifedipine GITS and a combined thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretic on cardiovascular morbidity and fatal events are being compared in patients with hypertension plus one or more additional risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, etc. INSIGHT is therefore the first trial to address, in a prospective fashion, the prognostic influence of antihypertensive treatment in hypertensives with concomitant risk factors.", 
    "585": "The combination of diabetes and hypertension increases the chances of progressive renal disorder and, ultimately, renal failure. Roughly 40% of all diabetics, whether insulin-dependent or not, develop diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world and accounts for more than a quarter of all end-stage renal diseases. Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Increased arterial blood pressure is an early and common phenomenon in incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy. The relationship between arterial blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy is a complex one, with diabetic nephropathy increasing blood pressure and blood pressure accelerating the course of nephropathy.", 
    "586": "Calcium antagonists antagonize preglomerular vasoconstriction. Additional putative mechanisms include the ability to retard renal growth and possibly to attenuate mesangial entrapment of macromolecules, and to attenuate the mitogenic effect of diverse growth factors. Calcium antagonists (except the original short-acting dihydropyridine drugs) reduce microalbuminuria and preserve kidney function in diabetic patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy. There are still no long-term trials using the new long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists to treat patients with incipient nephropathy. A recent, 1-year, randomized, double-blind study in hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy showed a better attenuation of the rate of decline in glomerular filtration in patients treated with nisoldipine (long-acting dihydropyridine) than with an angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The mean 24-h arterial blood pressure during this study was almost identical in both treatment groups, at 103 (SD 9) and 101 (SD 11) mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, a recent 5-year randomized open study in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent patients with diabetic nephropathy has revealed the same beneficial effect of a calcium antagonist and of ACE inhibition on the progression of nephropathy. In a third group treated with sympatholytic drugs, creatinine levels doubled in more than 50% of the subjects compared to less than 10% in the two other groups mentioned above. However, long-term studies are needed to consolidate these findings and expand them to insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease.", 
    "587": "Among the many guidelines and recommendations put forward by national and international authorities in recent years, there has been close agreement that the physician should assess each patient carefully over many months, should address the total profile of cardiovascular risk not just the raised blood pressure, and should treat patients right up to the age of 85 years with either classical essential hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension. The major guidelines described five groups of first-line antihypertensive drugs: diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists and alpha-blockers.", 
    "588": "In other areas, the various guidelines were either united in uncertainty, or divided on the best course of action. The availability of many new methods and approaches for the measurement of blood pressure has introduced greater uncertainty into the interpretation of the blood pressure level in the individual patient, with question marks still surrounding the interpretation of white-coat hypertension, of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and of home blood pressure readings in relation to clinic blood pressure. There is lack of uniformity in recommendations for the threshold values at which raised blood pressure should be lowered and in the recommendations for the target blood pressure the physician should set in the individual patient.", 
    "589": "Since the publication of the major guidelines in 1993 and 1994, the greatest uncertainty has surrounded the choice of drugs to initiate treatment. This reflects the fact that so far no major trials have been completed confirming that the newer agents such as ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists or alpha-blockers reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. While awaiting the results of the many prospective randomized trials that are in progress with these newer agents, a number of case-control studies have raised concerns that non-potassium-sparing diuretics may increase the incidence of sudden cardiac death and that calcium antagonists might increase the occurrence of coronary heart disease in hypertensive subjects.", 
    "590": "These issues highlight the importance of initiating prospective, randomized, controlled trials early in the development of all new drugs. While awaiting the results of trials currently in progress, the physician should continue to use all five groups of antihypertensive drugs, tailoring the choice of drug to suit the individual patient, and should use low doses of antihypertensive drugs either alone, or in appropriate combinations.", 
    "591": "Chronically elevated blood pressure results from pathological alterations in control systems. Current approaches to elucidate the underlying etiology strongly emphasize the (patho)physiological significance of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which interestingly interacts with the sympathetic, the cholinergic and purinergic systems. While the angiotensin-II-receptor subtype 1 (AT1), which mediates the blood-pressure-related effects of angiotensin II (All), has so far been extensively investigated, the physiological relevance of the other angiotensin-II-receptor subtypes-in particular of the AT2-receptor subtype-is about to be evolved by analysis of the various signal transduction mechanisms and by evaluation of transgenic animals, e.g. the knock-out mice, following disruption of the single A-II-receptor subtypes. Based on the clinical success of ACE inhibitors, the blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System in many different ways has been recognized as a successful strategy to effectively lower blood pressure.", 
    "592": "Renin-angiotensin is both a circulatory and a local tissue system. However, in most circumstances, renin present in the heart and blood vessels is taken up from the plasma, and the kidney is the prime source of this renin. Tissues can then modulate and control the production of angiotensin II. In various organs, angiotensin II has local actions. In the heart, working through the AT1 receptor, it increases contractility and may cause cardiocyte hypertrophy. Indirectly, the heart is also very much affected by the vascular actions of angiotensin II. However, the net result on the heart is the product of an important interaction between a large number of factors. There is little doubt that an inappropriately high plasma (and tissue) level of renin, related to sodium balance, is associated with increased left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular complications. The genetic approach will lead to an understanding of genomic risk factors in hypertension and may identify control systems--at present unknown--which will lead to a new approach to the prevention of cardiovascular death. It is, however, unlikely that such a factor will clearly predict an individual's prognosis, but it will, rather, identify groups at risk. Constellations of genomic interactions with multiple environment factors reduce this power. Modification of the response to angiotensin II using present treatment, or interrupting the response at more distal sites, may enable us to achieve the beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy without the detrimental effects.", 
    "593": "The beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in heart failure appear to be independent, at least in part, of their effect on blood pressure. The existence of a local cardiac renin angiotensin system is often suggested as an explanation. It has been known for some time that a substantial proportion of arterially delivered angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by ACE of the coronary vascular endothelium. The levels of angiotensin II in cardiac tissue are several times the levels of angiotensin II in circulating blood. Recent evidence suggests that most of the angiotensin II in the heart is not derived from angiotensin I in the circulation, and that most of the angiotensin I in cardiac tissue is generated in the tissue itself. On the other hand, renin mRNA levels are very low or undetectable in the normal heart. In addition, studies on the effects of bilateral nephrectomy on the cardiac tissue levels of renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II in pigs have indicated that cardiac renin originates from the kidney and that cardiac generation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II depends on renin from the kidney. Intracardiac synthesis of renin may occur under pathological conditions and during fetal development. The fact that angiotensins are generated by the heart raises the possibility of local mechanisms to regulate the concentrations of these peptides at certain tissue sites. For example, preliminary evidence suggests that binding of renin to cardiac membranes is a mechanism by which renin is taken up by the heart. A specific renin binding protein has been identified in cardiac tissue. Cardiac ACE levels may also influence local angiotensin II formation and are, in part, determined by the so called insertion/deletion ACE gene polymorphism. More detailed knowledge on the site of angiotensin generation and on its regulation will improve our understanding of the role of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiac function, hypertrophy, and postinfarction remodelling.", 
    "594": "Some renal diseases (e.g. diabetic nephropathy and IgA glomerulonephritis) cluster within families, consistent with a strong genetic component for the development or progression of these diseases, or both. In this context it is attractive to examine the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. This polymorphism determines the concentration of angiotensin I-converting enzyme not only in serum, but also in tissues and thereby presumably the locally available concentration of angiotensin II. Several studies have examined whether this polymorphism is associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy, but most of these failed to show such an association. Studies in patients suffering from IgA glomerulonephritis or other renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, demonstrated that the insertion/ deletion polymorphism plays a role in the progression of renal diseases and in the response to treatment with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "595": "The conceptual framework for treatment of congestive heart failure has changed dramatically in the past 30 years. The 1950s and 1960s were characterized by manipulation of the left ventricular function curve by digitalis and diuretics. The 1970s focused on relief of symptoms by afterload reduction with vasodilators. Then stimulation of cardiac output with inotropes was shown to relieve symptoms, but patients died sooner. Now the focus is on the neurohumeral milieu and methods to counteract excess renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the drugs of choice because they also improve survival, but beta-blockers are becoming popular. The effect of molecular cardiology on practice guidelines for congestive heart failure is yet to be seen.", 
    "596": "The tissue renin angiotensin systems (RAS) may have specific roles that complement those of the systemic RAS. In the adrenal, the tissue RAS has been implicated in mediating the response of the tissue to stimulation by ACTH and potassium ions, but its role in the response to angiotensin II stimulation has not been addressed. To examine this, rat adrenals were incubated either as bisected glands or as separated capsular glands (largely glomerulosa) under control conditions, or in the presence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, or of angiotensin II, or both. Captopril inhibited the two different tissue preparations in different ways. In the capsular gland it inhibited basal aldosterone output, but facilitated its response to angiotensin II. In the bisected gland, captopril inhibited the response of aldosterone to angiotensin II. The results illustrate the importance of the tissue RAS in the synthesis of aldosterone and the response to angiotensin II, and the two sets of data suggest that the fasciculata and glomerulosa zones interact in the formation of aldosterone. One way in which this may occur is by the mobilisation of fasciculata synthesised substrate, such as 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone (18-OH-DOC), for conversion by the glomerulosa, which is apparently supported by endogenous angiotensin II.", 
    "597": "Acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity studies, carcinogenicity bioassays, and reproductive and genetic toxicology studies were performed with quinapril, an ACE inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension. Acute toxicity is minimal in rodents, and repeated dosing elicits gastric irritation, juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) hypertrophy and hyperplasia and tubular degenerative changes in the kidney, and reduced red cell parameters and heart weights in rodents and/or dogs. Other manifestations of toxicity, including hepatic lesions in dogs, reduced offspring weights in rats, marked sensitivity of the rabbit, and clastogenic effects at cytotoxic doses in the in vitro V79 chromosome aberration assay, have been reported with other drugs of this class.", 
    "598": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of cilazapril on exercise tolerance and the hormone kinetics of catecholamines, the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system and alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in patients in the chronic phase of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The subjects consisted of 19 cases of AMI. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed 1 month after the onset of AMI, and patients were randomly assigned to either a group treated with 1 mg/day of cilazapril (9 cases) and or an untreated group (10 cases). After the completion of 2 months of exercise training at the anaerobic threshold (AT), blood samples were taken during a cardiopulmonary exercise test and various hormones were measured. In comparing the parameters of exercise tolerance before and after the completion of exercise training there were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to oxygen uptake, oxygen pulse, or exercise time at AT or at peak exercise. With regard to temporal changes in exercise tolerance, oxygen uptake, oxygen pulse and exercise time all tended to increase in both groups. With regard to hormone kinetics, the alpha-ANP concentration at peak exercise was significantly lower, and the noradrenaline secretions also tended to be lower, in the cilazapril-treated group, even though the peak exercise time was similar in both groups. These results may be support the hypothesis that cilazapril mitigates the left ventricular load during exercise therapy in patients in the chronic phase of AMI.", 
    "599": "A previous epidemiological study has reported the elevation of a serum metalloendopeptidase activity for underground coalminers exposed to chronic inhalation of coal mine dust particles. In this work, we have unambiguously characterized this activity as neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) using five different criteria. The apparent molecular weight of 100,000 g mol-1 calculated for the serum peptidase using Western blots or direct binding of the neutral endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor [125I]-RB104 to the enzyme in acrylamide gels, suggests that the soluble form of this ectoenzyme is not generated by a post-translational cleavage of the membrane-bound form, as is the case for the closely related ectoenzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme. The circulating endopeptidase very likely results from a shedding process. The increase in serum neutral endopeptidase 24.11 activity of underground miners compared with surface miners (5.7-fold), P < 0.01) is not correlated with systemic inflammation parameters, but seems to reflect the chronic pulmonary inflammatory state induced by coalmine dust exposure, and so may be a marker of lung injury.", 
    "600": "Bradykinin (BK) in an asanguinous salt solution was perfused through intact rat liver. The perfusate was delivered through the portal vein and was collected from the inferior vena cava. BK concentrations varied from 0.0030 to 38.0 microm. The liver had a large capacity to degrade BK and the system did not approach saturation until perfusate BK concentrations reached 60 microm. The quantitatively predominant BK fragments formed and the amount of each formed, expressed as a percentage of the BK degraded during a single transhepatic passage, were Pro-Pro, 74%; Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe, 15%; and Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro, 7%; the first is indicative of initial aminopeptidase-P cleavage of BK to yield Arg and des-Arg1-BK and the latter two are indicative of initial angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) cleavage of BK. On the other hand, while the perfused rat lung also had a large capacity to degrade BK, the quantitatively predominant BK fragments formed and the amount of each formed, again expressed as a percentage of BK metabolized during a single transpulmonary passage, were Pro-Pro, 47%; Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe, 35%; and Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro, 7%. Thus in rat liver the aminopeptidase-P pathway is the major route for BK degradation, whereas in rat lung the aminopeptidase-P and the ACE pathways exhibit nearly equal capacities to degrade BK.", 
    "601": "It is recognized that heart failure in patients with atherosclerotic lesion is the result of ischemia. However, there may also be cardiac cell dysfunction independent of ischemia, as factors advancing both of atherosclerosis and heart failure are discovered. The renin-angiotensin system is one of factor and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) prevents progression of atherosclerotic lesion and heart failure. To elucidate the association of atherosclerosis and cardiac cell dysfunction, we investigated the effects of ACEi on cultured cardiac myocytes. Captopril increased beta-receptor density of myocytes and augmented the response to isoproterenol. CV-3480, a ACEi, also up-regulated beta-receptors but angiotensin I, angiotensin II and angiotensin type I receptor antagonist did not. Bradykinin B2 receptor blocker, HOE140, suppressed the effect of captopril on cultured cells. The results suggest that ACEi up-regulated beta-receptors and augmented the response to beta-receptor agonist through BK potentiation.", 
    "602": "We have previously shown that idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common non-proliferative primary glomerulopathy in adult African Americans. In this report we present our experience with treated FSGS in 15 such patients followed over five years. They were all treated with prednisone 60 mg daily for three months, followed by a slow tapering. In addition, two patients later had cyclophosphamide, and five had enalapril. At entry hypertension was present in 73% of the patients, nephrotic syndrome in 87%, and elevated serum creatinine (> or = 1.4 mg/dl) in 40%. Five of the 15 patients (33%) developed end-stage renal failure (ESRF), one of them having a \"malignant\" course after the advent of pregnancy. Two patients (13%) have chronic renal insufficiency (CRI; serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl); three (20%) have mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.4-2.5 mg/dl), and five patients (33%) have normal renal function. The cumulative renal survival was 93% at five years, but only 26% at eight years. At last follow-up all the ten patients who did not develop ESRF were in partial remission (urinary protein of 1.3 g/day +/- 1.21), but 4 of the 5 patients who did not develop ESRF had no prolonged partial remission of nephrotic syndrome. Neither the initial clinical parameters not the use of enalapril correlated with the renal outcome (univariate analysis). However, 4 of the 5 patients who developed ESRF had elevated serum creatinine at entry, versus only 2 of the 10 not developing ESRF (p = 0.09 by two-sided, and 0.045 by one-sided Fisher's exact test). We conclude that the short-term renal outcome in nephrotic adult African Americans with treated FSGS is comparable to that of the non-African Americans, but their long-term prognosis may be poorer. Patients developing ESRF were more likely to present with elevated serum creatinine. Enalapril did not seem to modify the course of renal disease, but its utility and that of other ACE inhibitors in the treatment of FSGS must await prospective randomized studies.", 
    "603": "1. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril were studied in 30 hypertensive patients with various degrees of renal function. 2. After a single oral dose, apparent cilazaprilat clearance was dependent on renal function being 16.0 +/- 3.0, 11.1 +/- 3.0, 8.7 +/- 3.7 and 6.7 +/- 2.1 l h-1 (means +/- s.d.) in patients with creatinine clearances (CLcr) of > 100, 41-100, 21-40, and 8-20 ml min-1, respectively. .3 During 11 weeks of treatment with cilazapril, doses were adjusted to the CLcr and varied from 0.5 to 5.0 mg once daily. At 24 h after drug administration a clear antihypertensive response was seen only in the low clearance groups (CLcr < 40 ml min-1). In contrast, and despite higher once daily dosages, the decline of mean arterial pressure was small and cilazaprilat concentrations after 24 h were lower in the high clearance groups. 4. This study demonstrates that chronic once daily treatment with cilazapril is effective in patients with impaired renal function at dosages adjusted to creatinine clearance. No accumulation was seen. Since cilazaprilat clearance was high in the high creatinine clearance groups, a clear antihypertensive response in these groups was only seen at 3 h after drug administration.", 
    "604": "Myocardial infarction was induced by rats by ligation of the left coronary artery. Treatment with TM1, a prodrug of SQ 28,603, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11), was started 18-20 hours after ligation and was continued for 4 weeks (100 mg/kg, orally, twice daily). Morphological and biochemical parameters were assessed at the endo of therapy. The treatment resulted in a significant reduction of heart hypertrophy, which was restricted to the parts of myocardium hemodynamically upstream of the infarcted left ventricle. The weights of the right ventricle and atria were reduced by 15-20%, whereas the treatment had no effect on the left ventricle and septum weights. Treatment led to an almost complete inhibition of plasma NEP activity and to a slight decrease (-14%, p < 0.05) in plasma ACE activity. Plasma ANF level increased 3.8-fold after ligation, and treatment resulted in a slight ( + 29%) and nonsignificant additional increase in the ANF level. The amount of hydroxyproline in the right ventricle was enhanced by + 207% in control ligated rats and by +140% (NS) in treated rats. These data indicated that prolonged NEP inhibition exerts a favorable effect in heart failure by reducing the development of right ventricular and atrial hypertrophy. These effects may result from an improvement in hemodynamic conditions, leading to a reduction in cardiac preload.", 
    "605": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a syndrome characterized by increased levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). In vitro, Ang II stimulates ET-1 release. The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of a single dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril versus placebo on plasma endothelin concentration in human congestive heart failure. Captopril (25 mg, given orally) was compared with placebo in a group of 20 patients with systolic dysfunction in a double-blind randomized study. Plasma irET concentration was significantly increased in CHF patients compared with normal subjects (5.59 pg/ml +/- 0.35 vs. 3.58 pg/ml +/- 0.99, p < 0.0002). Despite the decrease in systolic blood pressure and the increase in plasma renin activity, suggesting a significant blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, no difference in plasma irET-1 was observed between captopril and placebo. Our results suggest that captopril does not acutely influence irET-1 plasma concentration in human CHF. These data do not support the hypothesis that the acute vasodilator effect of a single dose of 25 mg of captopril given daily orally involves modulation of the increased plasma concentration of endothelin observed in CHF.", 
    "606": "The purpose of the present article was to review the current evidence on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in acute myocardial infarction (MI). This article is based on published information as well as on our personal experience derived from an extensive analysis of the SMILE study. All the randomized trials have been included irrespective of the primary endpoint, and the results are presented in terms of either hemodynamic or clinical benefit. Short- and long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors in patients with acute MI results in a significant reduction in mortality, which is more evident in high risk patients (i.e., patients with left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure on admission, or anterior myocardial infarction). Development and progression of congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction was significantly reduced by ACE inhibition, which also reduced the rate of reinfarction, the need for revascularization procedures, as well as the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, probably through a mechanism involving some drug-dependent effects. In conclusion, the available data strongly support a wide benefit associated with the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with high-risk acute MI.", 
    "607": "There is increasing evidence suggesting angiotensin II (AII) may inhibit memory formation in a range of conditioned avoidance and habituation learning tasks in rodents. We were interested to determine if AII might also play an inhibitory role in spatial learning. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the formation of AII from AI, improve acquisition and/or retention of basal performance inhibited by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine, in conditioned avoidance and habituation tasks. In hooded Wistar rats, over 5 days of training in a water maze neither the ACE inhibitor, ceranapril 5 and 50 micrograms/kg/day, nor the ACE inhibitor, ramipril 2 and 10 mg/kg/day, altered the increase in path length produced by administration of scopolamine 0.75 mg/kg/day. In probe trails (without platform), on the last day of training, ceranapril 50 micrograms/kg produced a 35% further deterioration in performance in the scopolamine-treated rats (P < 0.02). Administration of the substrate, renin, that leads to AII formation, did not alter water maze performance over 5 days of training. The angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan, has been shown to improve basal and scopolamine-impaired performance in a habituation task and reverse the inhibition in long-term potentiation produced by diazepam. However, neither losartan 10 and 30 mg/kg/day nor ramipril 2 and 10 mg/kg/day reversed diazepam-impaired (3 mg/kg/day) acquisition of the spatial memory task over 5 days of training. These studies suggest AII does not inhibit spatial learning in rats in the constant platform position water maze task nor does it mediate the inhibitory effects of scopolamine or diazepam in this task.", 
    "608": "While captopril-enhanced renal scintigraphy is acknowledged to be a useful screening technique to detect clinically silent obstructive lesions of the main renal arteries, the presence of significant atherosclerosis of distal, smaller renal vessels as a cause of positive scintigraphy scans has not been reported extensively. In a retrospective 2-year analysis of 31 consecutive captopril-enhanced renal scintigrams, we found a total of 13 studies in 11 patients that were classified as \"positive\" for renal artery stenosis. Of these 11 patients with positive scintigraphic studies, 4 patients underwent 5 renal arteriography procedures; only 1 of these renal arteriograms showed significant stenosis of the main renal artery. In the other 4 cases, an angiographic pattern of diffuse intrarenal distal arterial disease correlated with scintigram lateralization. Angiography was also performed in 4 patients with negative captopril renal scintiscans. In each of these cases the arteriogram was also negative for significant renal artery stenosis, and only 1 patient had diffuse bilateral intrarenal arterial disease. We conclude that distal renal arterial narrowing should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lateralized renal scintigrams. A negative renal scintigraphic study may be more reliable for excluding significant main renal artery obstructive disease.", 
    "609": "During the past two decades, major investigative interest has been focused on the determinants of chronic renal disease and interventions to retard the inexorable progression to end-stage renal disease. Recent studies have provided a theoretic framework for anticipating that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and possibly calcium antagonists, may preferentially retard the progression of renal disease. Whereas the majority of available clinical trials have assessed the effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), there are relatively few long-term studies that have evaluated the renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists in patients with nondiabetic renal disease. Although clinical trials have been initiated using both of these drug classes as monotherapy, theoretical considerations suggest that fixed-dose combinations of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist might be appealing as renal protective agents. Several lines of evidence suggest that the renal microcirculatory effects of coadministration of both agents should be complementary. Similarly, recent observations suggest that the two classes may act in a complementary manner to countervail pathogenetic mechanisms at the level of the mesangium. A recent study in type II diabetic patients demonstrated that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist induced the greatest reduction in proteinuria, and reduced the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) more than did either agent alone at the same level of blood pressure reduction. Based on such considerations, recent randomized prospective studies have been initiated to compare the renal protective effects of combination calcium antagonist-ACE inhibitor therapy versus monotherapy with agents of either of these two antihypertensive classes.", 
    "610": "Increases of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) during controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) induce positive fluid balances by decreasing renal excretion. We investigated whether elevated levels of AVP and/or PRA maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) during PEEP under conditions where plasma volume is not expanded. Six conscious chronically tracheotomized beagle dogs, kept under standardized conditions, were investigated in four protocols. They were 1) control: 1 h spontaneous breathing with a continuous positive airway pressure of 4 cmH2O (CPAP 4) followed by 2 h CMV with PEEP, resulting in a mean airway pressure of approximately 20 cmH2O (CMV 20 referred to as \"PEEP\"); 2) vasopressin blockade: 1 h CPAP 4, 2 h PEEP after intravenous application of an AVP V1-receptor antagonist (AVPA); 3) converting enzyme inhibition: 1 h CPAP 4, 2 h PEEP plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI); and 4) combined blockade: 1 h CPAP 4, 2 h PEEP plus AVPA + ACEI. In AVPA + ACEI, MAP decreased during PEEP from 101 +/- 4 to 75 +/- 10 mmHg, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased from 3.6 +/- 0.3 to 1.7 +/- 0.7 ml.min-1.kg body wt-1, heart rate increased from 95 +/- 10 to 122 +/- 7 beats/min, plasma aldosterone increased from 62 +/- 26 to 353 +/- 63 pg/ml, plasma epinephrine increased from 81 +/- 15 to 352 +/- 89 pg/ml (all changes P < 0.05), and plasma norepinephrine did not change. Neither MAP nor GFR changed during PEEP in control experiments in which both PRA and AVP increased, in AVPA experiments in which PRA increased, or in ACEI experiments in which AVP increased. We conclude that both AVP and angiotensin II contribute to the maintenance of MAP and GFR during PEEP. When both hormones are inhibited, no immediate compensation exists to prevent an acute fall in MAP and GFR.", 
    "611": "The natriuretic and depressor responses to novel dual inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) EC 3.4.24.11 and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were used to assess their activity in conscious cynomolgus monkeys. A survey of mercaptopropanoyl inhibitors revealed that compounds containing alanylproline or certain surrogates reduced blood pressure and increased sodium excretion, indicating a desirable profile of in vivo activity. Additional compound evaluation required specific in vivo assays for NEP and ACE inhibition. Accordingly, the potency of novel inhibitors against NEP and ACE were determined in conscious monkeys by the potentiation of the natriuretic activity of exogenous human atrial natriuretic peptide and inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I, respectively. This strategy led to the discovery that optimal in vivo activity was achieved when the mercaptopropanoyl group was replaced with mercaptoacetyl and the C-terminal alanylproline was replaced with conformationally constrained dipeptidomimetics. This work culminated in the identification of BMS-182657 as a prototypic dual NEP/ACE inhibitor with a highly desirable profile of in vivo pharmacology.", 
    "612": "To evaluate the interaction between renal nerves, the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), electrical stimulation of renal nerves was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in their normotensive controls, Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), before and after pharmacologic treatment with (a) a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (NEP-i) to enhance the intrarenal ANP activity; (b) an ACE inhibitor (ACE-i) to block RAS; (c) both NEP-i and ACE-i; and (d) the vehicle of the drugs. Renal nerve stimulation did not change arterial pressure (AP) but reduced renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urinary sodium excretion (UNa+V) in both WKY and SHR. NEP-i treatment in WKY and SHR had no systemic or renal hemodynamic effects but increased GFR and urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) excretion; UNa+V increased (+2.78 +/- 0.31 microEq/min) in WKY, whereas it did not change in SHR (+0.83 +/- 0.79 microEq/min). In both strains, ACE-i treatment reduced AP, increased RBF, and did not change GFR and UNa+V. The combined treatment with NEP-i and ACE-i did not modify the natriuretic effect observed in NEP-i treated WKY (+4.29 +/- 1.25 microEq/min), but it elicited a natriuretic effect in SHR (+3.98 +/- 1.29 microEq/min). Pharmacologic treatment did not change the hemodynamic and excretory responses to renal nerve stimulation in both WKY and SHR. In conclusion, NEP-i treatment increased UNa+V in normotensive rats without changing AP. In hypertensive rats, the natriuretic effect of NEP-i became evident only after block of RAS by ACE-i. Neither NEP-i nor ACE-i, even in combination, could modify the renal responses to sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "613": "In a previous study, the depressor activity of combined selective inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) depended on the level of ACE inhibition, whereas the renal responses were determined by NEP inhibition. Our study confirmed that a mixed NEP/ACE inhibitor BMS-182657 ([S-(R*,R*)]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-[(2-mercapto-1-oxo-3- phenylpropyl)amino]-2-oxo-1H-benzazepine-1-acetic acid) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) when renin release was reduced by a sodium load, suggesting that the depressor response did not require suppression of endogenous angiotensin II generation. Furthermore, a pressor dose of 30 ng/min of angiotensin II was required to block the depressor response to BMS-182657 in the presence or absence of exogenous human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP 99-126). Thirty ng/min of angiotensin II also significantly enhanced the natriuresis induced by hANP 99-126 after BMS-182657 administration. In contrast, a nonpressor dose of angiotensin II (3 ng/min) reduced basal sodium excretion and the natriuretic responses to exogenous hANP 99-126 in the presence or absence of BMS-182657. The potentiation of the urinary ANP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) responses to hANP 99-126 by BMS-182657 was similar for all doses of angiotensin II; therefore angiotensin did not alter the effects of BMS-182657 on ANP metabolism or cGMP accumulation in the kidney. In summary, the renal responses to mixed metalloprotease inhibitors were apparently mediated by ANP potentiation and were modulated by angiotensin II. The depressor activity depended on ACE inhibition but was not mediated solely by reductions in endogenous angiotensin II levels.",

    "622": "The hydrolase aminopeptidase A is an important regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, since it inactivates its most vasoactive component angiotensin II (Ang II). A single i.v. injection of a monoclonal antibody against mouse aminopeptidase A (ASD-4) induces a membranous-like glomerulonephritis in mice, characterized by an acute albuminuria, that is not dependent on complement, the coagulation system, or inflammatory cells. We hypothesized that this albuminuria is the consequence of a reduction in aminopeptidase A enzyme activity, that might subsequently lead to an increase in Ang II levels. Aminopeptidase A enzyme activity was analysed in vitro by a fluorimetric enzyme assay and in vivo by enzyme histochemistry. The role of Ang II in the induction of albuminuria in this model was studied by measuring the renal aminopeptidase A mRNA expression in our model by a competitive PCR assay as an indirect measure of Ang II levels. In addition, the role of Ang II in this model was studied by preventing the formation of Ang II with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or by blocking of the Ang II receptor with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan. Only antibodies that were able to inhibit the aminopeptidase A enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo induced an acute albuminuria in mice. Renal aminopeptidase A mRNA expression was increased by injection of the anti-aminopeptidase A antibody. Both enalapril and losartan treatment reduced the acute albuminuria, measured 1 day after injection of a monoclonal antibody against aminopeptidase A, by 91% and 83%, respectively. It is concluded that the induction of acute albuminuria is correlated to the enzyme-inhibiting capacity of the anti-aminopeptidase A antibodies. This impaired enzymatic activity most likely leads to an increase in the levels of Ang II, the best known substrate of aminopeptidase A. The results of our additional experiments are in keeping with our hypothesis that Ang II mediates this acute albuminuria. Whether this occurs by an increase of blood pressure or by a growth factor-like effect remains to be defined by further studies in this model.",

Cough was more common among women (70% of subjects). After adjustment (by backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis) for baseline differences, black subjects had a relative risk of 2.58 (95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 4.65; p = 0.01) of discontinuation of ACE inhibitor due to cough.",

    "627": "The human cough reflex is still poorly understood, although it is known to occur independently of bronchoconstriction. Sensitization of the cough reflex is a unifying hypothesis for chronic dry cough in several conditions, including gastroesophageal acid reflux, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cough, and cough-variant asthma. The most common cause of chronic dry cough is a group of related conditions of chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, and postnasal drip. In these cases the cough reflex may be sensitized through an action of inflammatory mediators from the nasal mucosa on the airways or a reflex sensitization of airway sensory nerves. The association of cough with gastroesophageal reflux may occur through a local esophageal-tracheobronchial reflex. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cough is a side effect of treatment in about 10% of patients; it probably results from inhibition of the degradation of kinins, particularly bradykinin, in the airway. Why some patients with asthma have cough as the principal feature of their disease is unclear. Tachykinins are probably involved in the mechanism of sensitization of the cough reflex, and the development of neuropeptide antagonists may open new research opportunities. A study that used ambulatory recording of cough in a group of subjects with asthma confirmed the presence of significant cough, the frequency of which did not correlate with lung function or diurnal variation in peak flow. This finding highlights the problem of cough in patients with asthma, a problem that probably has been underestimated in the past.", 
    "628": "The influence of some peptidase inhibitors on oedema and plasma extravasation induced by bradykinin and carrageenan in rat paw was evaluate. Bradykinin-induced oedema in normal rats was increased by o-phenanthroline (3.10(-2) M), by captopril (10(-6) M to 10(-4) M), by lisinopril (10(-6) M to 10(-4), or by lisinopril (10(-5) M) in combination with apstatin (8.10(-5) M or 1.4 10(-4) M). It was not modified by phosphoramidon (10(-6) M to 10(-5) M) and by diprotin A (10(-3) M). It was increased by mergepta at high concentrations (2.10(-4) M). Mergepta did not increase the potentiating effect of captopril. Carrageenan-oedema in normal rats was increased by captopril (10(-5) M), lisinopril (10(-5) M) and apstatin (1.4 10(-4) M. It was not modified by mergepta (10(-4) M), phosphoramidon (10 (-5) M) and diprotin A (109-3) M). Des-Arg1-bradykinin and Des-Arg9-bradykinin have low oedema-promoting effects. Captopril (10(-5) M) increased the effects of bradykinin but not those of carrageenan in kininogen-deficit Brown Norway rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme and aminopeptidase P appear to be main kinin-inactivating enzymes in rat paws. Carboxypeptidase N, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and dipeptidyl(amino)peptidase IV do not play a significant role in this inactivation.", 
    "629": "Injection of substance P (SP) in a rat hindpaw induced extravasation of 125I-labelled albumin in both hindpaws and salivation. Intravenous injection of SP dose-dependently increased vascular permeability. This latter effect was increased in rat paws by captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), administered locally in combination with diprotin A, an inhibitor of an dipeptidyl(amino)peptidase IV (DAP IV) or phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The increase in permeability induced by SP was inhibited by RP 67580, a NK-1-receptor antagonist. Intravenous injection of capsaicin induced labelled albumin extravasation in rat paws. This effect was increased by combination of captopril with diprotin A or phosphoramidon, but not by captopril associated with amastatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidase M (AmM). It was suppressed by RP 67580. Injection of collagenase in rat paws triggered a swelling and a local plasma exudation. These responses were reduced by RP 67580 but not by RP 68651, its inactive enantiomer. They were increased by combination of captopril with diprotin A or phosphoramidon in normal rats. The potentiating effects of captopril and diprotin A were suppressed by RP 67580 in normal rats but did not develop in kininogen-deficient rats. The oedema induced by collagenase was also increased by lisinopril, another ACE inhibitor, administered locally in combination with apstatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidase P (AmP). In rats pretreated by methysergide, collagenase-induced oedema was reduced and can be increased by captopril, by lisinopril, administered alone or by lisinopril associated with apstatin. It is concluded that SP is mainly inactivated in rat paws by ACE, DAP IV and NEP. In collagenase-induced oedema, a low amount of SP would be released from afferent nerve terminals by bradykinin formed in low amounts. Bradykinin is inactivated in rat paws by ACE and AmP. In collagenase-oedema, the pro-inflammatory effects of bradykinin are concealed by the effects of the other mediators.",

In the latter case, respiratory muscle dysfunction has been demonstrated in acute situation (cardiogenic shock) and in chronic cardiac insufficiency. In the former case, it has been shown in an animal model that respiratory muscle dysfunction could influence markedly the outcome of cardiogenic shock. In chronic cardiac insufficiency histologic, biochemical and contractile abnormalities of the respiratory muscles have been demonstrated in an animal model as well as in humans. These alterations may account, at least in part, for the sensation of dyspnea that these patients encountered.

All 4 substances were given in a double-blind, randomized manner according to a latin-square design over a period of 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 2 weeks in between. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and PAH clearance. Proteinuria was assessed by urine sampling at the end of each treatment period. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced significantly (p < 0.01) by all 3 drugs compared to placebo (108 +/- 9 mmHg placebo, 98 +/- 12 mmHg atenolol, 101 +/- 11 mmHg celiprolol, and 98 +/- 8 mmHg ramipril). Celiprolol induced a significant increase in ERPF compared to placebo (322 +/- 109 ml/min under placebo versus 391 +/- 110 ml/min under celiprolol, p < 0.05). GFR was slightly but insignificantly increased under atenolol and celiprolol. Filtration fraction (FF) remained unchanged in case of atenolol and celiprolol treatment and was slightly but not significantly reduced by ramipril. Proteinuria was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared to placebo by all 3 drugs (1.8 +/- 1.3 g/24 h under placebo, 1.2 +/- 1.2 g/24 h under atenolol, 1.2 +/- 1.1 g/24 h under celiprolol, and 1.4 +/- 1.4 g/24 h under ramipril). These data demonstrate that new beta-blocking agents show favorable effects on proteinuria and renal blood flow in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and arterial hypertension.

    "632": "Posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE) is a problem which occurs in 5-10% of renal transplant patients. The pathophysiology of PTE is not yet fully understood but does obviously not simply rely on elevated circulating erythropoietin (EPO) levels. In recent years pharmacological treatment alternatives to phlebotomy have been found. The therapeutic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is well documented, even though the mechanism of action remains unclear and may not be directly related to the effects on EPO production. The evidence for the action of theophylline in PTE is more circumstantial and its mechanism of action also unclear. From the current state of knowledge one cannot conclude that its adenosine-antagonistic activity is the likely mechanism for the control of EPO levels. The effect of theophylline on erythrocytosis without elevated EPO levels does make a unifying hypothesis even more difficult. Therefore, PTE should not be used as a model disease to draw conclusions on the physiological control of EPO production, even though there appears to be a subgroup of patients that respond to pharmacological treatment with a reduction of erythrocytosis and of EPO levels. The question whether this is an accompanying phenomenon or a true effect on the underlying etiology can not be answered at present. From a practical point of view, after excluding secondary causes, treatment of PTE should be carried out with low doses of ACEI in order to achieve a reliable therapeutic effect.", 
    "633": "1. The effects of fluvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on the vascular angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in hyperlipidaemic rabbits were compared with those of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. 2. Rabbits were fed a 1.5% cholesterol containing diet or normal diet for 16 weeks and treated with either fluvastatin or enalapril in the diet at the respective doses of 2 and 10 mg kg-1 day-1. The total cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid levels in serum were significantly increased in rabbits fed the high cholesterol diet. Treatment with fluvastatin but not enalapril resulted in a decrease in serum lipids. 3. The vascular ACE activities assessed via the cleavage rate from synthetic substrate in the aortic arches and upper thoracic aortae were increased by 8 to 10 times when the rabbits were made hyperlipidaemic. Fluvastatin as well as enalapril significantly lowered the tissue ACE in the aortae. 4. The ACE activities in serum did not alter in hyperlipidaemic rabbits either in the presence or absence of fluvastatin. The serum ACE activity was lowered by enalapril. 5. The lipid peroxide in serum as well as the plaque area in the thoracic aorta was significantly increased in the cholesterol diet-fed rabbits. Treatment with fluvastatin or enalapril reduced both serum lipid peroxide and plaque formation. The relaxant responses to acetylcoholine (ACh) were significantly suppressed in the cholesterol-fed rabbits. Treatment with fluvastatin or enalapril significantly reversed the suppression of ACh-induced relaxation. 6. It seems that the reduction of vascular ACE is not coupled to lipids and ACE activity in serum, but rather to lipid peroxidation. Thus, the decrease in vascular ACE activity by fluvastatin as well as the lipid-lowering effect may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis progression in the vasculature.",

However, there are exceptions within the different classes. Captopril seems to differ from the other ACE inhibitors and results in improvement of insulin sensitivity. The most pronounced improvements have been obtained with alpha 1-blockers.

The oral administration of LNAME significantly increased systolic BP values, which reached the levels of 186 +/- 7 mm Hg at week 8. Both quinapril and diltiazem reduced this, although the ACE inhibitor was more effective than the calcium antagonist. The chronic inhibition of NO resulted in an increase in water excretion whether or not the increase in systolic BP was prevented by the coadministration of either quinapril or diltiazem. At the end of the experiment, LNAME-treated rats presented higher proteinuria than control rats (140 +/- 4 mg/24 hours v 21 +/- 1 mg/24 hours, P < .05). This elevated protein excretion was normalized by both antihypertensive drugs. None of the treatments was able to modify either natriuresis or plasma creatinine levels. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (10(-12) to 10(-8) mol/L) were comparable in all groups. However, the vasoconstriction induced by either the continuous infusion of phenylephrine (10(-5) mol/L) or by a bolus of angiotensin II (1 nmol) was higher in the animals that received LNAME than in control ones. The antihypertensive therapy normalized the response to phenylephrine but not to angiotensin II. These data suggest that both quinapril and diltiazem are not only able to reduce BP elevation induced by the chronic administration of LNAME in rats, but also to prevent the renal damage and the hyperresponsiveness to phenylephrine induced by this NO synthesis inhibitor.", 
    "650": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of an ACE inhibitor (fosinopril) and a calcium antagonist (amlodipine) on the urinary albumin and transferrin excretion and their relationship to the blood pressure in essential hypertension. Twenty-four never-treated patients (mean age, 46.4 +/- 8.9 years) with a diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 114 mm Hg and normal renal function, randomly received amlodipine or fosinopril and, if the diastolic blood pressure was not normalized, doxazosin was added to the therapy. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 24-h urine collection for albumin and transferrin measurements were performed before and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized in 23 patients (96%). Before treatment, microalbuminuria was present in 50% of patients. In the amlodipine and fosinopril group, antihypertensive therapy significantly decreased blood pressure and, only in the fosinopril group, albuminuria. Transferrinuria did not change significantly in both groups. Fosinopril lowered albuminuria in all patients, whereas amlodipine only in half of patients. Albuminuria, but not transferrinuria, was significantly correlated to the ambulatory blood pressure. This correlation was more pronounced for systolic than for diastolic pressure. In essential hypertensive patients with normal renal function, a high prevalence of microalbuminuria can be observed. Albuminuria appears to correlate with ambulatory blood pressure, particularly with systolic pressure. Intrarenal hemodynamic changes seem to play a more important role than systemic blood pressure decrease in the reduction of albuminuria. Transferrinuria does not seem a useful marker to follow-up nondiabetic hypertensive patients with early signs of glomerular dysfunction.", 
    "651": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block degradation of bradykinin and bradykinin stimulates prostacyclin production. ACE inhibitors are reported to increase prostaglandins. Therefore, we set out to determine 1) the contribution of prostacyclin to the bradykinin-mediated vasodepressor effects of ACE inhibitors, 2) whether ACE inhibitors alter the effect of bradykinin on prostacyclin, and 3) whether the effects of ACE inhibitors on bradykinin and prostaglandins are class effects or dependent on ACE inhibitor structure. To address these questions, we compared the effects of captopril, quinapril and placebo on blood pressure, urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and the vasodepressor response to i.v. bradykinin in 21 salt-replete normal-to-high renin hypertensive patients. Captopril and quinapril doses were titrated to lower pressure similarly. Captopril, but not quinapril, increased excretion of prostacyclin metabolite (217 +/- 50 vs. 135 +/- 21 pg/mg Cr base line, P < .05). Both ACE inhibitors dramatically, equally potentiated the vasodepressor response to bradykinin; the bradykinin dose required to decrease mean arterial pressure 15 mm Hg or increase pulse 20 bpm was 50-fold lower in ACEI-treated than in placebo-treated subjects (10 +/- 0 and 12.1 +/- 2.1 ng/kg/min in captopril and quinapril groups vs. 567 +/- 109 ng/kg/min in the placebo group; P < .005). ACE inhibition significantly attenuated the prostacyclin response to bradykinin at any given level of hypotensive response. Indomethacin abolished the prostacyclin response to bradykinin but did not alter the vasodepressor response. These data demonstrate that ACE inhibitors potentiate bradykinin-mediated vasodepression through a prostaglandin-independent mechanism. They suggest that although ACE inhibitors increase prostaglandins by increasing bradykinin, ACE inhibitors may attenuate prostaglandin production through a second bradykinin-independent mechanism.", 
    "652": "Capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods have been developed for the speciation and quantitation of thiols and disulfides of biological interest, including the endogenous compounds glutathione, glutathione disulfide, cysteine, cystine, homocysteine, and homocystine and the therapeutic agents penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, N-acetylcysteine, and captopril. Good speciation and quantitation were achieved for the underivatized thiols and disulfides using a detection wavelength of 200 nm; detection limits were in the range 20-90 microM (1-4 pmol) using a 50-microns-diameter capillary. To achieve lower detection limits, thiols were derivatized with the thiol-specific probe molecule, 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent). Good speciation and quantitation were achieved for the Ellman's derivatized thiols using a detection wavelength of 357 nm; detection limits were in the range 5-50 microM (0.03-0.3 pmol) using a 25-microns-diameter capillary. Both the underivatized and derivatized methods were applied to the determination of glutathione in human erythrocytes. Glutathione concentrations of 2-3 mM were obtained for the erythrocyte samples analyzed, with good agreement between results obtained by the two methods.", 
    "653": "Guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials in progressive systemic sclerosis have been recommended to determine drug efficacy better. To date, the results of disease-modifying drugs in scleroderma have been disappointing. The treatment of esophagitis has been revolutionized by omeprazole. Raynaud's phenomenon can be treated with calcium channel blockers and iloprost. Scleroderma renal crisis can be treated with aggressive blood pressure control using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The best treatment for rapidly progressive scleroderma lung is still unknown. Future treatments in scleroderma should be tested with the use of recommended guidelines.", 
    "654": "Imidapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was infused subcutaneously at the rates of 9, 30, 90, and 300 micrograms/rat/day for 4 weeks via an osmotic pump implanted under the skin in the back of male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Plasma concentrations of imidaprilat as an active metabolite of imidapril, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and plasma ACE activity were determined periodically. These results were also compared with those of enalapril. The plasma concentrations of an active metabolite of both the imidapril and enalapril groups increased according to the doses and showed almost the same plasma concentrations at the same doses. Both groups significantly inhibited plasma ACE activity and reduced SBP, and these actions were maintained for 4 weeks. At the lowest dose studied (9 micrograms/rat/day), imidapril was more potent than enalapril in inhibiting plasma ACE (maximum 2.5-fold difference), but this difference was reduced at higher doses. In contrast, significant differences in SBP effects were observed only at the highest dose studied (300 micrograms/rat/day). Also, the imidapril group significantly decreased the relative heart weight at the rate of 300 micrograms/rat/day. Furthermore, good correlations between plasma imidaprilat concentration and plasma ACE activity or SBP were observed, suggesting that plasma concentration may be a useful marker of pharmacological effects. However, a poor relationship between plasma ACE activity and SBP for enalapril was observed, suggesting that this may not be an adequate marker of pharmacologic efficacy of ACE inhibitors in general. The clinical relevance of these findings is not known at present."
