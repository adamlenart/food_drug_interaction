    "1": "Two-phase multicentre randomized study in 177 outpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. For 6 weeks all patients received 25 mg C twice daily. Then they were randomized double-blind to switch for another 6 weeks to 50 mg L once daily (n=110) or to maintain C (n=55). On the first day of the switch they underwent ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM).", 
    "2": "Within 12 h of first dose, 31% of patients who switched to L had two consecutive systolic BP readings of 30 mmHg below their individual baseline value compared with 24% of patients who stayed on C. In 3% of patients with L and in 6% of the C patients systolic BP readings less than 100 mmHg were recorded within 12 h of first dose. The differences were not statistically significant. There were no clinical symptoms attributable to initial hypotension. During the 6 weeks double-blind therapy, 9% of L patients experienced at least one adverse event, compared with 16% of patients with C.",

    "4": "The purpose of this study was to assess the capacity of perfused rat hind limbs, the majority of which is skeletal muscle, to inactivate bradykinin (BK), and to compare the BK degrading capacity of rat hind limbs with the BK degrading capacities of rat lung and liver. BK, with tritiated Pro2 and Pro3 residues, in an asanguinous salt solution was perfused for a single passage through skeletal muscle and other tissues in the hind legs of the rat over a concentration range of .0029 to 49.3 microM. Rat hind limbs had a large capacity to degrade BK and the system did not approach saturation, even at 49.3 microM. A least-squares linear regression analysis and extrapolation to zero concentration was used to obtain values for amounts of BK degraded and BK fragments formed. The amount of BK cleaved was 95% of the administered dose. The major BK fragments formed, and the amount of each expressed as a percentage of the amount of BK degraded were Pro-Pro (BK 2-3), 8.6%; Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe (BK 1-5), 82%; and Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro (BK 1-7), 6%. The BK 1-5 yield was reduced from 82% to one-fourth of that by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. BK 2-3 formation is indicative of initial aminopeptidase-P cleavage of BK to yield Arg, and des-Arg1-BK. ACE inhibitor sensitive formation of BK 1-5 is indicative of initial kininase-II, also known as ACE, cleavage of BK. Thus in rat hind limbs, the ACE pathway is the preponderant mechanism for BK degradation, which is in contrast to our previously published reports that in rat liver the amino-peptidase-P pathway predominates, and that in rat lung both the aminopeptidase-P pathway and the ACE pathway exhibit nearly equal capacities to degrade BK.",

However, this association has not been confirmed in some study populations. We hypothesized that the discrepancies between these studies may be due to variations in the definition of ischemic heart diseases. According to the genotype of the ACE gene, we analyzed the profiles of 320 patients who underwent coronary angiography for suspected ischemic heart disease. We found that the II genotype of the ACE gene was associated with a longer period of time between the first anginal pain and the onset of myocardial infarction. Because higher ACE has been reported to be associated with higher plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, our observation suggests that the genotype of the ACE gene is a marker of fibrinolytic activity.",

While global tolerability was slightly reduced in patients with concomitant disease or some forms of medication (p < 0.05), it was rated as good or very good by more than 90 and 95% of patients even in those groups. In control patients, that is those with neither co-morbidity nor co-medication, the tamsulosin induced blood pressure reductions were similar to those previously reported for placebo treatment but were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

    "14": "To produce a large quantity of the angiotensin-converting- enzyme(ACE)-inhibiting peptide YG-1, which consists of ten amino acids derived from yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a high-level expression was explored with tandem multimers of the YG-1 gene in Escherichia coli. The genes encoding YG-1 were tandemly multimerized to 9-mers, 18-mers and 27-mers, in which each of the repeating units in the tandem multimers was connected to the neighboring genes by a DNA linker encoding Pro-Gly-Arg for the cleavage of multimers by clostripain. The multimers were cloned into the expression vector pET-21b, and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The expressed multimeric peptides encoded by the 9-mer, 18-mer and 27-mer accumulated intracellularly as inclusion bodies and comprised about 67%, 25% and 15% of the total proteins in E. coli respectively. The multimeric peptides expressed as inclusion bodies were cleaved with clostripain, and active monomers were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. In total, 105 mg pure recombinant YG-1 was obtained from 11 E. coli culture harboring pETYG9 which contained the 9-mer of the YG-1 gene. The recombinant YG-1 was identical to the natural YG-1 in molecular mass, amino acid sequence and ACE-inhibiting activity.",

Longterm treatment included a diuretic (furosemide), an ACE-inhibitor (benazepril), digoxin, and a betablocker (atenolol). The prognosis for DCMP is unfavorable--the described dog died 11 months after diagnosis.", 
    "16": "Previous work has suggested that not all immunoreactive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in tissues or cells is in a biologically active state. We have explored this possibility in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), one of the most widely studied in vitro endothelial cell systems. Our approach included characterization of the effect of increasing passage number on ACE activity and expression of immunoreactive ACE at the single cell level, the subcellular compartmentalization of active ACE, and the effect of phorbol ester (PMA) treatment. We found that both ACE activity and expression of ACE antigen were downregulated by cultivation (30% of ACE-positive cells at seventh passage vs. 90% in primary culture). ACE downregulation is specific (number of CD31-positive cells did not change with cultivation) and correlated with downregulation of factor VIII-antigen. The percentage of ACE-positive cells in permeabilized HUVEC at third passage was almost twice that in nonpermeabilized HUVEC (90% vs. 50%), indicating that HUVEC contain intracellular immunoreactive ACE. ACE activity, however, was similar when measured in intact cells and in cell lysates. Moreover, diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid (DASA), a membrane-impermeable ACE inhibitor, inhibited ACE activity in intact cells and in cell lysates at the same extent, thus implying that intracellular ACE is inactive. PMA (100 nM) treatment increased the percentage of ACE-positive cells at third passage from 57 to 96%. ACE activity was increased 3-fold in cell and 1.5-fold in the culture medium of PMA-treated cells. Analysis of ACE activity in intact monolayers and cell lysates of control and PMA-treated cells revealed that all enzymatically active ACE in PMA-treated cells is localized on the plasma membrane and acts as an ectoenzyme. We conclude that expression of ACE by HUVEC is downregulated by repeated passage in culture but can be restored by PMA treatment. In addition, ACE expression is heterogeneous between neighboring cells, and total immunoreactive ACE protein associated with HUVEC includes an inactive pool of the enzyme.", 
    "17": "The unregulated renin release by native kidneys is one of the factors responsible for the high incidence of hypertension after renal transplantation but, even after three decades of transplantation, there is still a lack of a method to identify it as the major cause of hypertension.", 
    "18": "We investigated whether or not peripheral renin activity, before and 90 min after 25 mg of captopril, can play this role. One hundred and five consecutive patients with SCr less than 2 mg/dl were studied 18 +/- 8 months after renal transplantation. Forty-seven of them were considered hypertensive and 58 normotensive. All hypertensive patients were submitted to the captopril test to analyse the peripheral renin activity profile.", 
    "19": "In the hypertensive group, 17 patients (36%) were considered Renin-pos and 30 (64%) Renin-neg. All Renin-pos (stimulated renin = 19.1 +/- 6.4 ng/ml/h) patients were submitted to bilateral nephrectomy (bNx) and re-evaluated 6 months later. All of them normalized renin activity (4.4 +/- 3.0 ng/ml/h, P = 0.0001) and 10 of 17 (60%) became normotensive and off drugs. The remaining seven (40%) decreased the number of hypotensive drugs from 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 0.5 +/- 0.7/pt/day. There was a correlation between b-Renin and dBP (r = 0.47, P < 0.05) which was lost after bNx. An 'in situ' renal-cell carcinoma was found in two cases. Serum creatinine did not change.", 
    "20": "This study shows that the unregulated renin-angiotensin system from the native kidneys plays a major role in the maintenance of hypertension in some patients with normal graft function and that peripheral renin activity can identify those who will benefit from bilateral nephrectomy.", 
    "21": "We evaluated the effects on cardiovascular structure of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan, administered either at hypotensive or nonhypotensive dosage in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were treated from ages 4 to 12 weeks with low-dose (1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) enalapril, low-dose (0.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) losartan, high-dose (25 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) enalapril, or high-dose (15 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) losartan. Untreated WKY and SHR were also studied. Rats were killed at 13 weeks of age, and the heart was weighed. Mesenteric small arteries were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph for determination of media thickness and lumen diameter. In fixed arteries, cell volume, number of cells per segment length, and number of cell layers were measured using the unbiased \"disector\" method. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by the high doses of both drugs, but the hypotensive effect was greater with enalapril than with losartan (P<0.05). In the high-dose enalapril and losartan groups, there were similar reductions in relative left ventricular mass, media/lumen ratio, and number of cell layers of resistance arteries; however, there were no differences in the cell volume or number of cells per segment length of resistance arteries. Low-dose enalapril did not affect systolic blood pressure or any of the structural parameters. The results show that the hypotensive effects of both losartan and enalapril were associated with outward remodeling of resistance arteries at the cellular level. The effect of losartan on resistance artery structure was equal to that of enalapril, despite the smaller hypotensive effect.", 
    "22": "We previously reported that the chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis increases cardiac tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme expression and causes cardiac fibrosis in rats. However, the mechanisms are not known. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a key molecule that is responsible for tissue fibrosis. The present study investigated the role of TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis. The development of cardiac fibrosis by oral administration of the NO synthesis inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to normal rats was preceded by increases in mRNA levels of cardiac TGF-beta1 and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. TGF-beta immunoreactivity was increased in the areas of fibrosis. Treatment with a specific angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, but not with hydralazine, completely prevented the L-NAME-induced increases in the gene expression of TGF-beta1 and ECM proteins and also prevented cardiac fibrosis. Intraperitoneal injection of neutralizing antibody against TGF-beta did not affect the L-NAME-induced increase in TGF-beta1 mRNA levels but prevented an increase in the mRNA levels of ECM protein. These results suggest that the early induction of TGF-beta1 via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor plays a major role in the development of cardiac fibrosis in this model.", 
    "23": "The Prevention of Events with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) trial is an 8,100 patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine the usefulness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in treating coronary patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. The hypothesis being tested in this trial is that patients with coronary disease and ejection fraction > or =40% who are treated with ACE inhibitors will experience a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or a revascularization procedure compared with patients treated with conventional therapy. The design of the PEACE trial is described herein.", 
    "24": "The renin-angiotensin system is mainly involved in several cardiovascular diseases and in the pathophysiology of heart failure. It exists as a circulating and a local system which can be differently regulated. Interventions in this system by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) antagonists or angiotensin-receptor antagonists slow the progression of heart failure and result in prolongation of life expectancy and improvement of hemodynamics.", 
    "25": "The main underlying mechanisms are: 1. Heart failure results in activation of the renin-angiotensin system as a compensatory mechanism with elevation of circulating angiotensin II, norepinephrine and vasopressin. Antagonists of this compensatory mechanisms acutely result in improvement of the hemodynamic situation. 2. Elevated circulating and local renin-angiotensin systems cause chronic structural myocardial and vascular effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme antagonists and angiotensin-receptor blockers modulate and partly antagonize these structural changes such as myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis and vascular proliferative responses. Gene and receptor regulation of the system are currently not fully understood and are subject of intensive research. 3. The renin-angiotensin system is closely related to the bradykinin system and thus indirectly to nitric oxide and endothelial function. Bradykinin has multiple other effects on the hemostatic system as a well as on the myocardium and vascular system.", 
    "26": "These complex interactions require further evaluation. Research with specific bradykinin antagonists will give new insights into this system.", 
    "27": "Many adrenergic agonists including isoproterenol, a beta1,2-adrenergic agonist, reduce alcohol consumption, but the mechanism of this effect is not known. Adrenergic agonists have a variety of effects, among which are their ability to raise both angiotensin (ANG) II activity and plasma glucose levels. Previous research has shown that ANG II and enhanced glucose levels are accompanied by reductions in alcohol intake. Therefore, the following experiments assessed the roles of each of these factors in the suppression of alcohol intake by isoproterenol. Male Wistar rats were trained to drink a quantity of 6% (w/v) alcohol using the limited access procedure, which offers a daily 40-min access to alcohol and water. In experiment 1, isoproterenol or vehicle was administered s.c. just prior to alcohol availability, and only the group receiving isoproterenol showed a marked reduction in alcohol intake. Following this, the groups were pretreated i.p. with either vehicle or ascending doses of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, indomethacin (2, 4 mg/kg), followed by either isoproterenol or vehicle. Control groups received either two vehicle injections or vehicle and indomethacin. Indomethacin alone did not affect alcohol intake at any of the doses tested but did dose-dependently attenuate the reduction in alcohol intake produced by isoproterenol. In experiment 2, isoproterenol was administered just prior to alcohol availability and when the suppression of alcohol intake stabilized, ascending doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (1, 20, 40 mg/kg), were given i.p. 1 h prior to the isoproterenol. Enalapril altered water intake but had no effect on the isoproterenol-induced reduction in alcohol intake. These results show that the inhibition of alcohol drinking by isoproterenol varies more closely with altered glucose levels than with increased ANG II synthesis. They also demonstrate that downstream consequences of a drug may play a role in its effect on alcohol intake.", 
    "28": "The endothelium controls vascular smooth muscle tone by secreting relaxing and contracting factors. There is a constant release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors(s) (EDRF) under basal conditions. In addition, the endothelium can increase the release of EDRF in response to humoral stimulation by vasoactive substances such as acetylcholine or bradykinin. Under physiological conditions the most important stimulus to the release of EDRF is an increase in blood flow, leading to increased shear stress on endothelial cells. Recent experimental studies have raised the possibility that bradykinin plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone at rest and during flow-stimulated conditions. Bradykinin is a very potent vasodilator that exerts its vasodilatory actions by causing endothelial release of nitric oxide, prostacyclin and/or endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. Recent studies in humans have demonstrated that bradykinin contributes to the regulation of coronary vascular tone under resting and flow-stimulated conditions. This mechanism has been shown to be important in humans in both peripheral and coronary arteries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only decrease angiotensin II but also increase bradykinin levels, since ACE is identical to kininase II, which degrades bradykinin. The beneficial vascular effects of ACE inhibitors may therefore be related to increased availability of bradykinin. Indeed, we have recently shown that ACE inhibition improves flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated vasodilation and that this beneficial effect is bradykinin-dependent. Our preliminary data also indicate that ACE inhibition improves endothelium-mediated vasodilation in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease due to an enhanced availability of nitric oxide. These findings suggest that the beneficial vascular effects of ACE inhibition in heart failure may be due in part to improved endothelial function.", 
    "29": "The endothelium controls vascular smooth muscle tone by secreting substances that cause relaxation and contraction. Under physiological, basal conditions the endothelium constantly releases nitric oxide, a process closely regulated by the effect of shear stress on endothelial cells. Recent data raise the possibility that, among many other substances, bradykinin also plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone. Bradykinin is a vasodilator that increases the activity of constitutive nitric oxide. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a complex clinical syndrome in which abnormal vascular endothelial function has been shown to occur at both the experimental and clinical level. The reduced nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in CHF is multifactorial. Constitutive nitric oxide synthase is downregulated as shear stress is reduced. Vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which produces angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinin, is up-regulated. Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor, and the reduced availability of bradykinin will further down-regulate constitutive nitric oxide synthase. The CHF-induced activation of tumour necrosis factor also leads to a down-regulation of constitutive nitric oxide synthase and to an increased rate of endothelial-cell apoptosis. These observations suggest that abnormalities of endothelial function in CHF may contribute to increased peripheral vasomotor tone both at rest and during exercise, and raise the possibility that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in CHF may be due in part to improved endothelial function.", 
    "30": "Research has established endothelial dysfunction as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying many cardiovascular disease processes. Tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in regulating processes that contribute to endothelial function and cardiovascular disease. A number of large clinical studies have demonstrated conclusively the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in patients with myocardial ischaemia and left ventricular dysfunction, including a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Mechanistic findings from these studies indicated that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition would extend to patients with preserved left ventricular function. Available results suggest that ACE inhibition with quinapril improves endothelial function in large and small vessels in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function. Quinapril also inhibits progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (> or = 130 mg.dl-1) and reverses the toxic effects of smoking on endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction also may be an important mechanism in episodes of angina and silent ischaemia. The central role of tissue ACE in endothelial function suggests that ACE inhibition has antiischaemic effects. A study in progress, the QUinapril Antiischaemia and Symptoms of Angina Reduction trial, addresses shortcomings in earlier studies of ACE inhibition for ischaemia and is expected to define the role of quinapril in ischaemia.", 
    "31": "The plasminogen activator or fibrinolytic system is an important determinant of vascular homeostasis. It is one of the endogenous defence mechanisms against intravascular thrombus formation, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction and other acute coronary syndromes. Reduced fibrinolytic activity is a risk factor for ischaemic cardiovascular events. The fibrinolytic system also contributes prominently to vascular remodelling. Fibrinolysis depends on a balance between plasminogen activators, such as urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. A growing body of evidence indicates that the renin-angiotensin system can disrupt the equilibrium of the fibrinolytic system both directly and indirectly, with clinical consequences. For example, it appears that angiotensin II and angiotensin i.v. increase the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. Pharmacological interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) exerts a positive influence on endogenous fibrinolytic balance by blocking the formation of angiotensin II and preventing the degradation of bradykinin. Recent data from our laboratory have provided additional evidence for a link between the renin-angiotensin system and the fibrinolytic system. These findings may help elucidate possible mechanisms by which ACE inhibition exerts vasculoprotective effects and reduces the risk of atherothrombotic events.", 
    "32": "Heart failure is a major medical problem in the elderly. Neurohormonal activation plays a role in the pathophysiology of heart failure, but is also affected by ageing. The present study was carried out to examine the influence of age on neurohormonal activation and prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "33": "We studied 372 patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III-IV), who were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (95%), diuretics (99%), and digoxin (59%). Their mean age was 68 +/- 8 years (range 38-80), left ventricular ejection fraction 0.23 +/- 0.08, and 77% were males. The relationship between age and plasma neurohormones (norepineprine, epinephrine, dopamine, renin, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide, and endothelin), and age and prognosis was examined. Only atrial natriuretic peptide and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide showed an independent, positive correlation with age (P < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, norepinephrine also increased, while renin and aldosterone decreased (all P < 0.05). As regards mortality (25%), there was no linear increase with ageing for the group as a whole during follow-up, but patients in the highest age quartile (> 74 years) had a significantly higher mortality (risk ratio 1.9) than younger patients (P < 0.05).", 
    "34": "Although several plasma neurohormones are affected by ageing on univariate analysis, only atrial natriuretic peptide and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide show a highly significant increase with ageing on multivariate analysis. There is no linear increase in mortality with ageing, but in the truly elderly heart failure patients (> 74 years), age alone was an independent predictor for mortality.", 
    "35": "Symptoms combined with a loss of quality of life can be considered part of the morbidity of heart failure. Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have a poorer quality of life than do those with other chronic conditions including arthritis and lung disease. Although there is no evidence to show a mortality benefit, diuretics are frequently used for symptomatic relief in CHF patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown both to improve symptoms and to reduce mortality; however, ACE inhibitors have yet to show any conclusive benefit in improving quality of life. Digoxin is widely used and offers symptomatic relief, but it has been shown to have no overall effect on mortality. More recently, certain beta-blockers have been shown to impact both morbidity and mortality in patients already receiving standard therapy including an ACE inhibitor and diuretics. This article reviews these and additional therapies currently used in the management of CHF in the context of their impact on the joint goals of reducing both morbidity and mortality.", 
    "36": "Recently, we have reported that endothelin-1 (ET-1) production is increased in blood vessels and glomeruli of rats with chronic renal failure. This study was design to investigate the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in endogenous ET-1 production in rats with reduced renal mass. One week after subtotal (5/6) nephrectomy, uremic rats were divided into three groups, and received either no treatment, the Ang II subtype 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg/day), or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) captopril (30 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Sham-operated rats were used as controls and received no treatment. The levels of immunoreactive ET-1 (ir-ET-1) in plasma and urine, as well as in vascular and renal tissues, were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after extraction. In uremic rats, losartan and captopril completely prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure. At week 6, plasma ir-ET-1 was similar in the different groups of uremic rats and in the controls. However, ir-ET-1 concentration in the mesenteric arterial bed, the thoracic aorta, preglomerular arteries, and glomeruli, as well as urinary ir-ET-1 excretion were significantly greater in uremic-untreated rats compared to controls (P < .01). Treatment of uremic rats with losartan or captopril reduced irET-1 concentration in the thoracic aorta and preglomerular arteries (P < .05), but ir-ET-1 concentration in the mesenteric arterial bed was unchanged. Although both drugs completely prevented the increase in proteinuria, losartan but not captopril significantly reduced ir-ET-1 concentration in glomeruli (P < .05) and normalized urinary ir-ET-1 excretion. This indicates that increased ET-1 production in blood vessels and glomeruli of uremic rats is modulated, at least in part, by Ang II through the AT1 receptor. The beneficial effects of the AT1 antagonist losartan could be attributable to the attenuation of Ang II-induced ET-1 production in this rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure, whereas those of the ACE-I captopril are not related to changes in ET-1 production in glomeruli.", 
    "37": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor temocapril on insulin sensitivity and its effects on renal sodium handling and the pressor system were investigated in essential hypertensive patients (EHT). Seven EHT were hospitalized and underwent a 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp before and after 2 weeks' administration of temocapril (4 mg/day). Insulin sensitivity was calculated using the M value from the infusion rate of glucose with hyperinsulinemia using the glucose clamp method. Renal clearances of sodium, lithium, creatinine, and paraaminohippuric acid were used to calculate fractional proximal and distal tubular reabsorption of sodium (FPR(Na), FDR(Na)) and renal plasma flow (RPF) before and during insulin infusion by the glucose clamp method. Temocapril decreased blood pressure and increased M value significantly. Before temocapril treatment, hyperinsulinemia by the glucose clamp induced significant decreases of urinary excretion of sodium (U(Na) V) and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). After treatment, these decreases were attenuated, and the change of U(Na) V (deltaU(Na) V) with hyperinsulinemia was significantly higher and deltaFENa showed a higher tendency, compared with before the treatment. FPR(Na) showed no change with hyperinsulinemia before treatment, but significantly decreased after treatment. DeltaFPR(Na) was significantly lower after treatment than that before treatment. FDR(Na) showed an increase with hyperinsulinemia, and deltaFDR(Na) was similar between before and after treatment. RPF showed no change with hyperinsulinemia, and no difference was found in deltaRPF between before and after treatment. Plasma norepinephrine level (PNE) and plasma renin activity (PRA) showed increases, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) did not change with hyperinsulinemia. There were no significant differences in deltaPNE, deltaPRA, and deltaPAC between before and after treatment. From these results, it is suggested that in EHT 1) temocapril improves insulin resistance, and 2) although temocapril shows no significant influence on the augmentation of pressor systems by hyperinsulinemia, this agent attenuates the sodium-retaining action of hyperinsulinemia, which may be attributable to suppression of insulin-induced sodium reabsorption at the proximal tubules. These effects may lead to additional beneficial effects in the treatment of essential hypertensives with insulin resistance.", 
    "38": "Hypertensives of African origin have low-renin, sodium-sensitive blood pressure and respond poorly to treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The epithelial sodium channel may be important in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension in this population. This is supported by the identification of mutations within this channel, which lead to excess sodium reabsorption and hypertension in Liddle's syndrome. In this study we tested whether there was linkage of the genes encoding the three subunits of the epithelial sodium channel to essential hypertension in 63 affected sibling pairs of West African origin from St. Vincent and the Grenadines. We found no support for linkage of the epithelial sodium channel to essential hypertension in this population. However, further studies will be needed in larger populations of African ancestry to exclude a contribution of the genes encoding the epithelial sodium channel to hypertension.",

Patients were randomized to three groups: placebo, lisinopril (10, 20, or 40 mg/day), or HCTZ (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/day). All groups were matched with regard to sex, race, age, body mass index, and waist/hip ratio. The primary analysis of ABP data revealed that both lisinopril and HCTZ effectively lowered mean 24-h systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure compared with placebo, (mean change from baseline SBP/DBP: -12.0/-8.2, -10.6/-5.5, and -0.3/-0.5 mm Hg, respectively); however, lisinopril lowered DBP better than HCTZ (P < .05). Secondary analyses of groups revealed that men responded better to lisinopril than HCTZ (-11.9/-7.3 v -6.6/-3.5 mm Hg, respectively), whereas women responded well to both drugs. White patients responded better to lisinopril than HCTZ, whereas black patients showed a significant response to HCTZ only. Response to treatment was also influenced by patient classification of 24-h blood pressure profiles, ie, \"dipper\" or \"nondipper.\" Overall, the majority of obese hypertensives were nondippers. Nondippers (n = 82) responded well to both drugs (-10.4/-6.9 v -12.5/-5.7 mm Hg, P < .05 v placebo), whereas dippers (n = 42) responded to lisinopril (-11.7/ -9.4 mm Hg, P < .05 v placebo and HCTZ), but not HCTZ (-5.6/-4.1 mm Hg, P = NS v placebo). Results of 24-h ABP data show that both lisinopril and HCTZ are effective therapies for obesity-related hypertension and that response to treatment is influenced by sex, race, and dipper/nondipper status.", 
    "40": "Survival of post-myocardial infarction patients is related inversely to their levels of very-low-frequency (0.003 to 0.03 Hz) RR-interval variability. The physiological basis for such oscillations is unclear. In our study, we used blocking drugs to evaluate potential contributions of sympathetic and vagal mechanisms and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to very-low-frequency RR-interval variability in 10 young healthy subjects.", 
    "41": "We recorded RR intervals and arterial pressures during three separate sessions, with the patient in supine and 40 degree upright tilt positions, during 20-minute frequency (0.25 Hz) and tidal volume-controlled breathing after intravenous injections: saline (control), atenolol (0.2 mg/kg, beta-adrenergic blockade), atropine sulfate (0.04 mg/kg, parasympathetic blockade), atenolol and atropine (complete autonomic blockade), and enalaprilat (0.02 mg/kg, ACE blockade). We integrated fast Fourier transform RR-interval spectral power at very low (0.003 to 0.03 Hz), low (0.05 to 0. 15 Hz), and respiratory (0.2 to 0.3 Hz) frequencies. Beta-adrenergic blockade had no significant effect on very-low- or low-frequency RR-interval power but increased respiratory frequency power 2-fold. ACE blockade had no significant effect on low or respiratory frequency RR-interval power but modestly (approximately 21%) increased very-low-frequency power in the supine (but not upright tilt) position (P<0.05). The most profound effects were exerted by parasympathetic blockade: Atropine, given alone or with atenolol, abolished nearly all RR-interval variability and decreased very-low-frequency variability by 92%.", 
    "42": "Although very-low-frequency heart period rhythms are influenced by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as low and respiratory frequency RR-interval rhythms, they depend primarily on the presence of parasympathetic outflow. Therefore the prognostic value of very-low-frequency heart period oscillations may derive from the fundamental importance of parasympathetic mechanisms in cardiovascular health.", 
    "43": "This study was designed to investigate whether collagen type I degradation is altered in patients with essential hypertension and whether this alteration could be related to disturbances in the serum matrix metalloproteinase pathway of collagen degradation. A second aim of the study was to assess whether some relation exists between serum markers of collagen type I degradation and left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients.", 
    "44": "We measured serum concentrations of carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP) as a marker of extracellular collagen type I degradation, of total matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), or collagenase, of total tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), and of MMP-1/TIMP-1 complex in 37 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and in 23 normotensive control subjects. Serum concentrations of free MMP-1 and free TIMP-1 were calculated by subtracting the values of MMP-1/TIMP-1 complex from the values of total MMP-1 and total TIMP-1, respectively. Measurements were repeated in 26 hypertensive patients after 1 year of treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Baseline free MMP-1 was decreased (P<0.001) and baseline free TIMP-1 was increased (P<0.001) in hypertensives compared with normotensives. No significant differences were observed in the baseline values of CITP between the 2 groups of subjects. Hypertensive patients with baseline left ventricular hypertrophy exhibited lower values of free MMP-1 (P<0.01) and CITP (P<0.05) and higher (P<0.001) values of free TIMP-1 than hypertensive patients without baseline left ventricular hypertrophy. Treated patients attained an increase (P<0.001) in free MMP-1 and a decrease (P<0.05) in free TIMP-1. In addition, serum CITP was increased (P<0.05) in treated hypertensives compared with normotensive subjects.", 
    "45": "These findings suggest that systemic extracellular degradation of collagen type I is depressed in patients with essential hypertension and can be normalized by treatment with lisinopril. A depressed degradation of collagen type I may facilitate organ fibrosis in hypertensive patients, namely, in those with left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "46": "Several mechanisms are thought to play a role in the improvement in endothelial vasodilation produced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Both animal and clinical data are reviewed.", 
    "47": "Cardiovascular risk factors promote the development of cardiovascular disease by producing endothelial dysfunction. Interventions that improve endothelial function would therefore be expected to help prevent coronary disease. Studies have demonstrated that a variety of interventions, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological, can improve endothelial dysfunction. Several pharmacological interventions are briefly reviewed, with an emphasis on current issues and controversies.", 
    "48": "The endothelium plays a fundamental role in the regulation of the vascular tone. It produces EDRF-NO that dilates the vessels. In endothelial dysfunction, the reduction of EDRF-NO production increases the vasoconstrive effects of endothelin-1 and angiotensin-II. The endothelial dysfunction is part of the coronary artery disease. It can be minimized by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that block the deleterious effects of angiotensin-II.", 
    "49": "In our country, patients with congestive heart failure who are treated chronically with digoxin are usually advised by their physicians to stop taking the medication two days a week. This is probably aimed at decreasing digitalis toxicity. Based on digoxin pharmacokinetics we assumed that the drug plasmatic level should diminish by 40 to 50%, below the therapeutic concentration of 0.8 to 2 milligrams, after two days of suspension. The objectives of this study were: a) to analyze the reduction of the plasmatic concentration of digoxin after a two day interruption of treatment, b) to compare the plasmatic levels of the drug between patients who received continuous and discontinuous treatment. A prospective, randomized and simple blind trial was designed. A total of 36 patients with congestive heart failure and systolic dysfunction with atrial fibrillation or sinus rythm were included. Group 1 (19 patients) received continuous treatment and Group 2 (17 patients) took the drug from Monday to Friday. In the continuous treatment group there was no significant difference between the Monday (1.06 +/- 0.55 milligrams) and the Friday (1.1 +/- 0.57 milligrams) digoxin concentrations. In the discontinuous treatment group the Monday digoxin concentration (0.611 +/- 0.396 milligrams) was lower than the Friday one (1.04 +/- 0.58 milligrams). The difference was statistically significant with a p = 0.000002. In conclusion, the two days a week suspension schedule reduces the plasmatic concentration of digoxin to subtherapeutic levels while the continuous regime maintains stable concentrations within the therapeutic range. Adjusting the dose to the creatinine clearance, average concentrations of 1 milligram are obtained. These results suggest that digitalis intoxication could be prevented by adjusting the dose according to renal function rather than interrupting the treatment as it is usually done in our country.", 
    "50": "Recently, it has become clear that many of the intracellular signals mediated by Ang II receptors are similar to the signaling pathways activated by receptor tyrosine kinases. In the present paper, we are reporting a full characterization of Ang II receptors in rat fetal membranes. We assayed binding of the Ang II antagonist [125I]Sar1Ile8Ang II and the AT2 specific competitor [(125)1]CGP42112. Both ligands exhibited a rapid equilibrium and a high specificity for Ang II receptors. Competition studies confirmed the presence of both receptor subtypes, with a predominance of AT2 receptors and the following order of potency: CGP42112>Ang II>Losartan>PD123177. Immunoblotting studies of tyrosine phosphoproteins showed that Ang II (10(-6)M) mediates a rapid reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins with apparent molecular masses in the range of 30-45 kDa. Increasing concentrations of Ang II (10(-9) - 10(-6)M) showed a dose-response behavior, suggesting a clear physiological role of the observed effect. The response, blocked by Losartan and PD123177, seems to be mediated by both receptor subtypes. These results clearly indicate that both Ang II receptors mediate tyrosine dephosphorylation in early stages of development and support a role of these receptors in growth and development.", 
    "51": "We have shown previously that the combination of a long-acting, non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (trandolapril) and the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil improve insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle of the obese Zucker rat, a model of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. In the present study, we investigated the interactions of chronic treatment (28 days) with verapamil (20 mg/kg) and a short-acting, sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor (captopril, 50 mg/kg) in combination on insulinemia, lipidemia, glucose tolerance, and insulin action on skeletal muscle glucose transport (2-deoxyglucose uptake in epitrochlearis) in lean and obese Zucker rats. In lean animals, verapamil alone and in combination with captopril actually increased (P < .05) plasma insulin, whereas in obese animals, verapamil alone worsened the hyperinsulinemia already present, and this effect was abolished by cotreatment with captopril. Captopril alone or in combination with verapamil reduced plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels in obese rats, but not in lean rats. Captopril alone reduced the glucose-insulin index in obese animals given an oral glucose load, and this was associated with a significant increase in insulin-mediated muscle glucose transport. The greatest improvement in these responses was elicited in obese animals receiving combined captopril and verapamil treatment, and was associated with increases in muscle GLUT-4 glucose transporter protein and hexokinase and citrate synthase activities. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the short-acting, sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor captopril can elicit beneficial metabolic effects on the hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance of muscle glucose transport of the obese Zucker rat. Moreover, there is a positive interactive effect on these pathophysiological parameters between captopril and verapamil in this animal model of insulin resistance.", 
    "52": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are both common conditions associated with a high morbidity and mortality. When the two conditions occur together, as they do in 50% of diabetic individuals, the result is a 7.2-fold increase in mortality. If hypertension occurs in association with diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy, mortality rises to 37-fold above that of a healthy population. Despite the increase in incidence of nephropathy, cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of death in diabetic individuals. Therapy should therefore take into consideration the results of large, placebo-controlled trials which have shown reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as a result of active treatment. Although studies with the newer antihypertensive agents such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are ongoing, only diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have been clearly shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Despite concerns regarding adverse metabolic effects and loss of hypoglycaemic awareness, beta-blockers and diuretics do have a role in the management of diabetic patients. While it is clear that ACE inhibitors reduce the progression of diabetic nephropathy, evidence suggests that diuretics may be just as effective. However, unlike diuretics or beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors have no proven benefit in the prevention of stroke of myocardial infarction. Despite the claims of metabolic neutrality made for many antihypertensive agents there appears to be no advantage in their use in the majority of hypertensive diabetic patients, except where there exist specific contraindications to established therapies.", 
    "53": "The results of longitudinal studies in geriatric medicine were reviewed by referring to relatively recent publications. \"Longidufinal studies\" comprised not only cohort studies but also prospective case-control studies in the broad sense. Poor self-rated health, weight loss hypoalbuminemia, inability to perform activities of daily living, low levels of physical activity, and cognitive dysfunction, all of which could be manifestations of chronic diseases, might shorten longevity. Cardiomegaly or left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG were again found to be important risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the aged, because of their relation to atherosclerosis. There is no evidence regarding the contribution of hyperlipidemia to the risk of cardiovascular disease in the aged, although insulin resistance can increase serum triglyceride levels and reduced level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol even in the aged. Mortality due to stroke and heart disease have been decreasing in most developed countries, and several recent community-based studies have also shown decreases in the incidence of cerebral stroke. Large-scale case-control studies on the pharmacological treatment of hyperlipidemia have resulted in both primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. However, information concerning the effects of treatment for hyperlipidemia on coronary heart disease in the aged is limited. Results of large-scale case-control studies indicate that pharmacological treatment of elderly hypertensive patients can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have recently been shown ot be useful.",

This paper describes the development of a microbial biosensor for EMa using induced Bacillus subitilis cells. This biosensor measures the acceleration of respiration during specific metabolic pathways of this drug. It has been applied, with good results, for determination of the active ingredient in the pharmaceutical tablet formulations.", 
    "55": "Myofibroblasts and their potential to generate angiotensin (Ang) II and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) at sites of infarction in the rat heart have been implicated in tissue repair. These cells likewise contribute to repair in a subcutaneous pouch model of fibrous tissue formation. Their appearance in pouch tissue coincides with high density ACE and Ang II receptor binding, suggesting a role for Ang II in tissue repair. Using pouch tissue studied at different time points of repair, the present study examined the expression of requisite mRNA for Ang peptide generation: angiotensinogen, Ao; an aspartyl protease, either cathepsin-D, Cat-D, or renin: and angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE, TGF-beta 1 and type I collagen mRNA expression was also addressed. Unlike pouch studied on day 2 and 4, at 7, 14 and 21 days, we found: (a) expression of Ao, Cat-D but not renin, ACE and TGF-beta 1 mRNA; (b) Ang I and Ang II peptides in pouch tissue and exudate; (c) the presence of Cat-D activity but no renin activity; (d) an increase in type I collagen mRNA with time; (e) upregulation of pouch tissue ACE mRNA expression by lisinopril treatment, whereas AT1 and AT2 receptor antagonists (losartan and PD 123177, respectively) downregulated the expression of mRNA for ACE, when compared to untreated controls; (f) downregulation of TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression by lisinopril and losartan compared to untreated controls; and (g) PD 123177 had no effect, whereas lisinopril and losartan treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced type I collagen mRNA expression. Thus, in this model of fibrous tissue formation, we found expression of component genes involved in Ang peptide (I and II) and TGF-beta 1 generation and Ang II upregulation of TGF-beta 1 expression, suggesting Ang II and/or TGF-beta 1 may upregulate type I collagen expression during tissue repair. Pharmacologic intervention studies with lisinopril or losartan indicate Ang II plays a role in the reciprocal regulation of ACE mRNA expression, which modulates Ang II levels at sites of repair.", 
    "56": "The differential rate of growth of the left-ventricular free wall (LVFW) and the right-ventricular free wall (RVFW) of the newborn pig has been studied by measuring the rates of ribosome formation and protein synthesis in the isolated perfused heart. These measurements are limited by the heterogeneity of the cells and the stability of the preparation. The hypothesis of the present study was that isolated cultured myocytes would offer much less cellular heterogeneity and a more prolonged period to explore the actions of anabolic agents. The rate of [3H] phenylalanine incorporation into total protein during 24 h of culture was established as a monitor of the rate of protein synthesis in myocytes and was found to be 64 and 61% of the rates measured in the LVFW and RVFW, respectively, of the perfused heart. The relative rates of protein synthesis in LVFW and RVFW were the same in myocytes and perfused hearts. Myocytes from the LVFW had increased rates of protein synthesis after exposure to a combination of norepinephrine and propranolol or endothelin for 24 h. Exposure to endothelin for 3 days increased rates of protein synthesis to a greater extent in LVFW myocytes than in RVFW myocytes. In LVFW myocytes from enalapril-treated pigs or in LVFW myocytes exposed to 40 mM KCl, angiotensin II increased the rate of protein synthesis by 14% during the third day of incubation. These studies indicated that cultured myocytes reflected the rates of protein synthesis observed in LVFW and RVFW of the perfused piglet heart. Differential effects of an alpha-adrenergic agonist, endothelin and angiotensin II in LVFW as compared to RVFW myocytes was observed. In each case, the response to the agonist was decreased or absent in RVFW as compared to LVFW myocytes.", 
    "57": "Although heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is thought to produce hypertrophy in isolated cardiomyocytes via an autocrine mechanism, the pathophysiological role of HB-EGF, in myocardial hypertrophy in vivo, is not yet known. To investigate the involvement of HB-EGF in cardiac remodeling associated with hypertension in vivo, we assayed the expression of HB-EGF mRNA and protein in the left ventricle (LV) during the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).", 
    "58": "Prior to sacrifice and assay of HB-EGF and EGF-receptor (EGF-R) mRNA, morphologic and hemodynamic variables were measured in SHR and in age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). At 5, 9 and 12 weeks of age, rats were killed, their hearts were removed, and the expression of HB-EGF and EGF-R mRNA and protein were measured. In addition, SHR and WKY were treated with enalapril, atenolol, or both for 4 weeks.", 
    "59": "In untreated SHR, double products (i.e. systolic blood pressure (sBP) multiplied by heart rate (HR), an index of mechanical load, peaked at 9 weeks. Expression of HB-EGF mRNA was also observed to peak in these animals at 9 weeks, while expression of EGF-R mRNA increased from 5 to 9 weeks, but remained constant thereafter. In untreated WKY, double products and EGF-R mRNA expression did not change over time, whereas the level of HB-EGF message increased gradually. Antibody to HB-EGF reacted primarily with myocyte membranes in SHR, whereas antibody to EGF-R reacted mainly with interstitial cells in these animals. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, markedly decreased sBP in SHR, whereas the beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, atenolol, significantly decreased HR. While neither alone affected the expression of HB-EGF mRNA, their combination significantly reduced the expression of HB-EGF mRNA, as well as double products, in these rats, but had no effect on expression of EGF-R mRNA.", 
    "60": "The enhanced expression of HB-EGF mRNA and protein in LV of SHR suggest that this growth factor may play an important role during the early development of LV hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in SHR. The association between double products and HB-EGF expression suggest that the latter may be induced by increased mechanical load and may contribute, in turn, to cardiac remodeling.",

All patients had clinical renal disorders and underwent renal biopsies.", 
    "63": "Analysis of renal biopsy specimens showed that 31 patients had class IV LN. Class II, III, and VLN were present in two patients each. The average GFR increased significantly from 65.4 (SD 33.0) in the pretreatment stage to 86.6 (31.6) ml/min in the post-treatment stage, accompanied by an improvement in urinary or immunological abnormalities, or both. On the other hand, RPF decreased significantly from 625.2 (243.0) to 519.8 (179.0) ml/min. Therefore, the filtration fraction (FF) increased significantly from 10.7 (4.3)% to 16.8 (3.7)%. Low FF was recognised predominantly in patients with class IV LN, but was also observed in patients with other classes. The FF returned towards normal irrespective of the degree of GFR recovery. No significant changes were observed in the levels of blood pressure.", 
    "64": "A reduction in GFR out of proportion to the reduction in RPF as demonstrated by the low FF values was related to the severity of LN or disease activity, or both.

    "81": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have shown unexpected benefits in the prevention of ischemic events in patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. In addition to these clinical observations, there is a growing body of knowledge about the molecular and cellular effects of ACE inhibitors. For example, ACE inhibition prevents stimulation of smooth muscle cell angiotensin II receptors, thereby blocking both contractile and proliferative actions. Angiotensin II blockade also diminishes the production of superoxide anion, which inactivates ambient nitric oxide. ACE inhibition of kininase II inhibits the breakdown of bradykinin, a direct stimulant of nitric oxide release from the intact endothelial cell. Thus, at the cellular level within the vasculature, ACE inhibition shifts the balance of ongoing mechanisms in favor of those promoting vasodilatory, antiaggregatory, antithrombotic, and antiproliferative effects. These effects underlie the potential benefits of ACE inhibition in the therapy of ischemia and atherosclerosis. Some data is available in humans to show that these effects can be sustained for months, thereby maintaining improved endothelial function and, presumably, allowing the initiation of steps that might alter the progression of atherosclerosis. Definitive information is not yet available in humans to show that ACE inhibition clearly alters the progression of atherosclerosis or diminishes coronary events in uncomplicated coronary disease. This promising area of investigation is, however, the subject of multiple clinical trials, which should provide clarification of this important question in coming years.", 
    "82": "The vascular endothelium secretes factors that not only modulate blood vessel tone, but also participate in the development and progression of atherosclerosis through their effects on platelet adhesion and aggregation, thrombogenicity, and cell proliferation. Altered activities of these substances in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, aging, postmenopausal status, smoking, and infections) appear to underlie the atherosclerotic process. There is increasing evidence from both preclinical studies and clinical trials that nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of arteriosclerosis. This review describes the role of NO in human health and disease and summarizes strategies currently being used to measure and improve endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "83": "Over 100 years of scientific investigation has established that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in both the renin-angiotensin system and the kinin-kallekrein system. ACE inhibitors--which stem the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor--have proved to be useful agents in the management of hypertension, in the prevention and treatment of heart failure, and in the improvement of endothelial function. Generally, ACE inhibitors are as efficacious as beta blockers and thiazide diuretics in reducing blood pressure and also induce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Many trials-including the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), the Veteran's Administration Cooperative Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I), the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), and the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial--have demonstrated the ability of ACE inhibitors to reduce mortality within a wide range of heart failure, from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to severe heart failure. The SAVE trial specifically evaluated the effects on post-myocardial infarction mortality and remodeling and found that ACE inhibitors were effective in reducing both. Further studies are assessing the potential additional antiatherosclerotic aspects of ACE inhibitors. Initial research indicates a reversal of endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerotic animals, and subsequent clinical trials, including the Trial on Reversing ENdothelial Dysfunction (TREND), support the likelihood of a similar effect in humans. Beneficial effects in hypertension or heart failure may also be gained with other interruptors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin receptor blockers. Results from studies assessing these receptor blockers will bring greater understanding to the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors.",

    "88": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, on proteosynthesis in the aorta, acetylcholine-stimulated aortic relaxation and endothelaemia (circulating endothelial cells) was investigated in rabbits with aortic insufficiency. The animals were studied 28 days after experimental intervention. Cardiac volume overload stimulated proteosynthesis in the aorta as reflected by increased ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentration and [14C] leucine incorporation into proteins of the aorta. Moreover, the number of endothelial cells in the blood was increased. The administration of captopril starting from the second day of the haemodynamic overload, partially prevented the increase both in aortic proteosynthesis and in endothelaemia. Despite these alterations, the relaxing ability of the aorta to acetylcholine was not changed either by the haemodynamic overload or by captopril. We conclude that the increase of proteosynthesis in the aorta and of endothelaemia in the early period of chronic cardiac volume overload in rabbits were partially prevented by chronic captopril treatment. Neither aortic insufficiency nor captopril changed the acetylcholine-induced relaxation of the aorta.", 
    "89": "Ventricular remodeling indicates a dynamic process, starting with and after acute myocardial infarction, as a result of structural and functional modifications which involve acutely and chronically both the infarcted and noninfarcted zones of the left ventricle. The most effective way to prevent or minimize post-MI cardiac remodeling is to limit the extent of the initial insult. This can be partly achieved by early myocardial reperfusion obtained by different strategies including thrombolysis. In 6405 patients of the GISSI-3 trial, 2D echocardiographic studies were available at predischarge, at 6 weeks and at 6 months after the infarction. The increase in left ventricular volumes over time was reduced by 6-week lisinopril treatment. Patients randomized to lisinopril had smaller volume also at 6 months, after withdrawal of treatment at 6 weeks. Important prognostic indications can also be derived from predischarge echocardiography, since larger quartiles of left ventricular volumes and lower quartile of ejection fraction indicates higher risk of mortality and non-fatal congestive heart failure in the 6 months after the index event, even in the relatively low risk general population of infarcts of the GISSI-3.", 
    "90": "Recent trials have shown that ACE-inhibitors are safe and can reduce mortality and the occurrence of severe left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD) (when started within the first day after acute myocardial infarction (MI) and continued for 4 to 6 weeks thereafter). GISSI-3, ISIS-4 and CCS-1 studies show that more than half of the lives are saved by ACE-inhibitor treatment within the first week of therapy. Although the benefit from ACE-inhibitor is larger in patients presenting with congestive heart failure (Killip class >1), the number of lives saved in patients at low risk, who represent the majority of the population, is relevant. This supports the approach of treating all hemodynamically stable MI patients. Treatment could be stopped after about 1 month in patients without evidences of LVD while those with LVD should be continued on ACE-inhibitors for a long period of time.",

    "100": "Myocardial dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH) is inactivated after incubation at 30 degree C, with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-dependent systems. The enzyme inactivation was a function of the pro-oxidant system composition and the time of incubation. The standard inactivating system contained 50 mM KH2PO4-K2HPO44, pH 7.4, 0.5-1.0 muM LADH, and pro-oxidant system. After 30 or 60 min of incubation with the MPO/H2O2/NaCl system, LADH inactivation was 64 and 87%, respectively (Figure 1). In the absence of NaCl, inactivation values were 9 and 27%, respectively, whereas in the absence of MPO the inactivation values were 4.0 and 11%, respectively (Figure 1). Under similar experimental conditions, sodium hypochlorite significantly inactivated LADH, thus supporting the role of hipochlorous acid as agent of the MPO/H2O2/CINa system. With the MPO/H2O2/Kl, MPO/H2O2/SCN or the MPO/H2O2/NaNO2 systems LADH inactivation depended on the anion nature, 1-being the most effective (Figure 2). NaNo2 effectively replaced halides as pro-oxidant (Figure 3). The MPO/NADH/halide systems, where NADH replaced H2O2, also inactivated LADH. Native (not denatured) catalase completely prevented the MPO/NADH/Kl system effect (Table 1), in close agreement with H2O2 production by the LADH-catalysed NADH oxidation and the role of H2O2 in LADH inactivation. LADH was also inactivated after incubation with MPO-generated free radicals such as the Chloropromazine and Paracetamol radicals (Table 2). Thiol compounds (Captopril, penicillamine, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine and mercaptopropionylglycine) (Table 3 and Figure 4), as well as taurine, ascorbate (Table 4), GSSG and trypanothione (Figure 5), protected LADH against the MPO-dependent oxidizing systems, and also against NaCIO (Table 4).

The patients were randomly assigned to continue or to discontinue use of vasodilators; carotid sinus massage was repeated 2 weeks after randomization. By the end of the study period, the baseline values of systolic blood pressure were significantly different between the 2 groups of patients both in supine (P=.01) and upright (P=.03) positions. Syncope had been induced by carotid sinus massage in 81% of patients in the \"on-vasodilator\" group and in 62% of patients in the \"off-vasodilator\" group (P=.21). The cardioinhibitory reflex was of similar magnitude in the 2 groups, being found in 50% of the patients in each group, with a maximum ventricular pause of 7.1 +/- 2.7 and 6.7 +/- 1.8 seconds, respectively. The percentage decrease of blood pressure did not differ between the 2 groups, even if, in absolute values, the baseline difference of blood pressure roughly persisted for the duration of the test. In consequence of that, the rise of blood pressure to similar values was delayed approximately 30 seconds in the \"on-vasodilator\" group and took more than 2 minutes to return to baseline values.",

Classical Ang II function including vasopressor effect, cardiotropic action and aldosterone production is mainly mediated through AT1-R that present in cardiovascular system, adrenal glands and kidneys. AT1-R is abundantly expressed in whole bodies of fetus and its expression is abruptly decreased after birth, and in the adult AT2-R is expressed in brain nuclei, uterus, adrenal medullary glands and ovary. AT1-R and AT2-R are both G-protein coupled receptors and have 46% similarity in amino acid levels with seventh transmembrane conformation. Signal transduction pathway of AT1-R is mainly CA2+ and activation of protein kinase C, while that of AT2-R is still unknown. Clinical application of AT1-R antagonist started and this causes elevation of plasma Ang II levels, which selectively stimulates AT2-R. Thus, one should realize AT2-R-mediated effect in treatment with AT1-R antagonist. We have shown that AT2-R has anti-AT1-R action, such as inhibitory action against AT1-R-mediated positive chronotropic effect or AT1-R-induced proliferative effect, resulting in the protective effects on Ang II-induced cardiovasucular and renal action. Thus, elucidation of AT2-R function will be important in clinical treatment with AT1-R antagonists.",

In the perprotocol analysis, active treatment reduced total mortality by 24% (P = .05), reduced all fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular end points by 32% (P<.001), reduced all strokes by 44% (P = .004), reduced nonfatal strokes by 48% (P = .005), and reduced all cardiac end points, including sudden death, by 26% (P = .05).",

The per-protocol analysis suggested that treating 1000 patients for 5 years would prevent 24 deaths, 54 major cardiovascular end points, 29 strokes, or 25 cardiac end points. The effects of antihypertensive drug treatment on total and cardiovascular mortality may be attenuated in very old patients.", 
    "137": "We studied the effects of long-term treatment with enalapril (5 mg/kg/day orally) on various biochemical and cardiovascular complications in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) hypertensive rats. Female Wistar rats made diabetic or hypertensive or both by streptozotocin (STZ; 45 mg/kg) or deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA; 10 mg/kg, p.o., daily) or both. Enalapril (5 mg/kg) was administered daily by the oral route for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, blood samples were taken to analyze glucose, insulin, and lipids. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded by a noninvasive technique, and cardiac functions were recorded by Neely's working heart preparation. Injection of STZ produced severe glycosuria (>2%), hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and loss of body weight. It also produced hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, bradycardia, and decreased left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in left ventricular tissue. DOCA by itself did not produce any change in blood glucose but reduced serum insulin levels in nondiabetic animals. However, in the diabetic group, DOCA reduced blood sugar levels. Treatment with enalapril prevented an increase in the blood pressure and the heart weight. Decrease in the heart rate, reduction in LVDP, and increase in intracardiac activity were observed in diabetic rats; these were also prevented by enalapril treatment. Enalapril had no effect on plasma glucose and did not modify plasma insulin levels in diabetic animals. The effects of STZ and DOCA together were not additive on the investigated parameters, and enalapril was similarly efficient in diabetic and diabetic hypertensive animals.", 
    "138": "It is well documented that the kidney plays a fundamental role in long-term arterial pressure regulation, and, as an endocrine organ, in the regulation of cardiovascular structure and functionality. In this study, the antihypertensive effect of long-term treatment (6 months) with placebo, verapamil, trandolapril, and a combination of the latter (verapamil plus trandolapril) was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats after half-renal-mass ablation. Arterial pressure was monitored during treatment and at the end, aortic structure and functionality were investigated. Trandolapril and the combination returned pressure to normal, whereas verapamil was less effective. All three treatment groups were similarly effective at reducing aortic medial hypertrophy, the wall-to-lumen ratio, and contraction evoked by potassium chloride and noradrenaline. Verapamil and veratran were more effective than trandolapril at reducing lamina media cross-sectional area. Trandolapril and the combination were more effective than verapamil at improving endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "139": "This study examined the effects of long-term treatments with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and the calcium antagonist, amlodipine, on the morphologic changes, progressive left ventricular dysfunction, and gene expression of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and phospholamban (PLN) in dilated cardiomyopathy. From the ages of 5 through 20 weeks, dilated cardiomyopathic hamsters, BIO53.58 (BIO), and control hamsters, F1b, orally received either enalapril or amlodipine. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. At the age of 20 weeks, the collagen volume fractions were analyzed by the stereologic method. RyR and PLN messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were examined by Northern blot in the amlodipine group. In BIO, the reduction of left ventricular percentage of fractional shortening was attenuated in the enalapril group (p < 0.05) and amlodipine group (p < 0.001), and the increase in the collagen volume fraction and the loss of myocytes were suppressed in the amlodipine group compared with the untreated group. RyR mRNA level decreased in BIO (p < 0.01) compared with F1b, but PLN mRNA level was unchanged. RyR and PLN mRNA levels were unaffected by the treatment with amlodipine. Enalapril and amlodipine prevent progressive remodeling and reduce cardiac dysfunction in BIO. Amlodipine prevents fibrosis and cell death without modifying RyR and PLN mRNA levels in BIO.", 
    "140": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. It is unclear whether reduced formation of angiotensin II or attenuated degradation of bradykinin is responsible for the beneficial effects. We investigated the role of endogenous angiotensin II in ischemia/reperfusion injury by studying the effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan on myocardial function, infarct size, and perfusion after ischemia/reperfusion. Anesthetized pigs were subjected to 45 min of regional ischemia and 240 min of reperfusion. Starting 5 min before reperfusion, four groups of pigs (n = 6 in each) received coronary venous retroinfusion of candesartan (0.2, 2, or 20 microg/kg) or vehicle for 30 min. Myocardial regional blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres in two separate groups (n = 6 in each) given 20 microg/kg candesartan or vehicle. Retroinfusion of 20 microg/kg of candesartan improved recovery of left ventricular systolic segment shortening measured by sonomicrometry in the ischemic area compared with 0.2 microg/kg of candesartan and vehicle. Infarct size, as a percentage of the area at risk, was smaller in the 2 and 20 microg/kg groups than in the vehicle group (39.1 +/- 11.6% and 34.8 +/- 10.2% vs. 78.3 +/- 8.9%, p < 0.01). There was no difference between candesartan and vehicle in their effects on regional myocardial blood flow. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade supports myocardial functional recovery and reduces infarct size. This effect is not related to improved regional myocardial blood flow during reperfusion.", 
    "141": "Our recent studies have shown that the nonpeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist losartan interacts with thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptors and inhibits the thromboxane A2 (TxA2) analog U46619-induced vasoconstriction in canine coronary arteries. In this study, we further investigated whether losartan prevents TxA2-induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Pretreatment with losartan (10 microM) significantly reduced U46619-induced, concentration-dependent washed platelet aggregation. The inhibition is specific for losartan, because another Ang II AT1-receptor antagonist, CV11974 (10 microM), an active metabolite of TCV116, did not block the platelet aggregation caused by U46619. In addition, losartan (10 microM) augmented acetylcholine (ACH)-induced nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation and abolished the ACH-induced endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF)-mediated vasoconstriction in the aortic rings from adult SHRs. U46619 produced dose-dependent vasoconstriction in aortic vessels of SHRs, which was demonstrated to be blocked by the potent, selective TxA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist SQ29,548. Pretreatment with losartan (10(-6)-10(-5) M) inhibited the contractile response of U46619 and shifted the concentration-response curve to the right in a dose-dependent manner. The effective concentration at half maximal contraction (EC50) of U46619 was increased 2.5- and 7.6-fold in the presence of 1 and 10 microM losartan, respectively, without changes in maximal contraction. The active metabolite of losartan, EXP3174, at 1 microM also competitively inhibited U46619-induced contractions in aortic rings of SHRs. In contrast, neither the AT1-receptor antagonist CV11974, the AT2 antagonist PD123319, nor the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, each at concentrations of 1 microM, had any effect on the U46619-induced constriction in aortic rings. In conclusion, losartan, acting as both AT1- and TxA2/PGH2-receptor antagonists, may enhance its therapeutic profile in the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "142": "Post-infarction prognosis is considerably impaired if left ventricular systolic dysfunction and/or symptomatic heart failure develops. As the symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction are often subtle or completely lacking, such patients can be identified only by objective evaluation of left ventricular function. However, as symptoms of heart failure may develop despite normal left ventricular function, objective evaluation of left ventricular function is also important in symptomatic patients, since prognosis is especially poor in the presence of systolic dysfunction. As echocardiography is the most suitable and accessible method in the context, also allowing assessment of cardiac dimensions and valvular function, its extended use in post-infarction patients is imperative. Left ventricular dysfunction should be prevented by adequate measures to limit the extent of infarction and prevent its recurrence. To improve prognosis, the use of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors should be considered whenever left ventricular dysfunction is present, irrespective of symptomatology. Treatment with amiodarone has recently been shown to reduce mortality among patients with post-infarction heart failure, and should also be considered in such cases, especially if there is a need of antiarrhythmic therapy. Although beta-receptor blockers have well-documented beneficial effects in myocardial infarction, their effect on patients with latent or overt heart failure has not been specifically studied. The use of angiotensin II antagonists in patients with post-infarction heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction is currently under investigation.",

This response was not modified by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, or by an endothelin receptor antagonist in either vessel. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, inhibited the vasoconstrictor response in both blood vessels. Homogenates of saphenous vein and internal thoracic artery displayed tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, which was inhibited by captopril. Enzyme activity was threefold greater in the vein. Both the contractile response to angiotensin II and the enzyme activity were retained in venous grafts removed up to 20 years after coronary bypass surgery.", 
    "147": "These data demonstrate that marked differences exist in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and AT1 receptor responses in the saphenous vein compared with the internal thoracic artery.

    "148": "In this study, the effect of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) Ramipril (5 mg/day) and calcium antagonist Isradipin (5 mg/day) treatment of two groups of hypertensive patients (n = 22 in each of group) was evaluated. The parameters of the hemorheological profile (blood and plasma viscosity, red blood cell aggregation and deformation, plasma protein concentration and its osmolality, hematocrit and ratio of Hct/blood viscosity) were measured in basal conditions (before treatment) and after 3 weeks of treatment. The patients showed some increased blood, plasma viscosity, RBC aggregability and fibrinogen concentration in basal conditions. In both groups of patients, three main parameters of the hemorheological profile (plasma viscosity, Hct and RBC aggregation) decreased after treatment. No significant changes in red cell deformability was found. In conclusion, ACE inhibition with Ramipril and calcium channel blocking with Isradipin lead to a moderate improvement of blood rheology in patients with hypertension. This may be explained by the pronounced vasodilatatory effect of ACE inhibitor and calcium antagonist, though their acting mechanism is different.",

Effects of vehicle (VEH) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP) were examined in wild-type (WT) or T26 mice treated from 7 to 100 d of age. Mortality was lower in CAP T26 mice (30 mg/kg: 8%; 100 mg/kg: 12%) than VEH T26 mice (52%). The urinary protein/creatinine ratio was increased in VEH T26 mice (19.5+/-7.60) versus WT mice (6.1+/-0.83), but not in low-dose (7.3+/-0.94) or high-dose (8.2+/-1.02) CAP T26 mice. Blood urea nitrogen was higher in VEH T26 mice (52+/-16.2 mg/dl) than VEH WT mice (24+/-0.8). Blood urea nitrogen was also elevated in CAP WT (high dose: 43+/-2.1 mg/dl) and T26 mice (high dose: 42+/-2.4 mg/dl).

These data validate recent nonrandomized studies of captopril in HIV-infected patients, and suggest that an angiotensin-converting enzyme substrate is an important mediator in HIVAN. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of captopril in HIVAN may be warranted.",

The major hydrolysis products during the initial 5-min incubation were YGGFLR and Y, which indicates that dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase activities were mainly involved in the hydrolysis. After 60 min of incubation, dyn-(1-8) was completely hydrolyzed in both membrane preparations. When the ileal and the striatal preparations were incubated for 60 min in the presence of both captopril, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor, and amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, 63.8 and 49.3% of dyn-(1-8), respectively, were hydrolyzed. The YGG fragment was the major hydrolysis product in both preparations. When the ileal and the striatal membrane fractions were incubated with dyn-(1-8) in the presence of three peptidase inhibitors, captopril, amastatin and phosphoramidon (an inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.11), approximately 95% of the opioid octapeptide remained intact in both cases. This shows that dyn-(1-8) was almost exclusively hydrolyzed by three enzymes, amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, captopril-sensitive dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I and phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11, in both ileal and striatal membranes. Additionally, the Ke (equilibrium dissociation constant) values of selective antagonists against dyn-(1-8) and its initial main hydrolysis product YGGFLR in two isolated preparations pretreated with the three peptidase inhibitors indicate that the latter acts on mu receptors in guinea pig ileum but delta receptors in mouse vas deferens and the former acts on kappa receptors in both preparations. It is indicated, therefore, that in the absence of peptidase inhibitors endogenously released dyn-(1-8) acts either through dyn-(1-8) itself on kappa receptors or through YGGFLR on mu or delta receptors depending on both the three peptidase activities and the three receptor type densities at the target synaptic membrane.",

Therapy with cyclosporin, glucocorticoids, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provides the prospect of longer courses of renal insufficiency for patients with HIVN, and perhaps the hope of blunting progression of the disease when patients are treated early. Trials of patients with biopsy-proven HIVN are important to evaluate further the role of such newer therapies. HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease have been treated with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplantation. The course of therapy for dialysis patients may be improving, but ultimately depends on the stage of the viral illness. The disparities in the demographic composition of the patient populations probably underlies findings reported from different centers. Transplantation is currently a low-priority treatment option for HIV-infected patients with ESRD, but several studies provide fascinating insights into viral-host interactions.",

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and side effects of combination therapy (O + D + B) in patients with postinfectious persistent cough. Patients who had been coughing for more than three weeks and had a history of upper-airway infection took part in the study. None had any history of nasal disease, gastroesophageal reflux, bronchial asthma, or other chronic pulmonary disease. All patients were non-smokers, and none used angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. All had normal chest roentgenograms and normal pulmonary function. The following hematological data were obtained before treatment: peripheral eosinophil counts. CRP levels, serum IgE concentrations, and titers of cold agglutinins and antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The effects of one week of treatment with O + D + B on the severity of coughing, as estimated with a cough diary, were examined. Thirty-six patients entered the study, but only 18 with normal hematological findings who satisfied the study criteria were eligible for efficacy and side-effect analyses. Cough scores decreased significantly from 5.1 +/- 2.4 (range, 2-9) to 1.2 +/- 1.9 (range, 0-6), and the rate of cough disappearance was 50%. Two patients reported slight drowsiness. Therapy with O + D + B reduced perception of coughing as estimated with a cough diary.

    "171": "The data from animal and human in-vivo studies suggest that cardiac function is dependent in part on the normal function of the GH/IGF-1 axis (growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1). The syndrome of heart failure appears to be associated with a perturbation of the GH/IGF-1 axis. So far encouraging results from phase II clinical trials evaluating the effects of long-term growth hormone treatment in patients with moderate to severe chronic congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy have been published. In these studies growth hormone (i.e., DNA-derived recombinant human growth hormone) was not used alone but in addition to standard optimal therapy for chronic heart failure. The following rationale is the basis of this new approach for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. According to Laplace's Law, cardiac wall stress(i.e., the force acting per unit of cross-sectional area of the ventricular wall) is directly related to intraventricular pressure and ventricular radius and inversely related to ventricular wall thickness. Cardiac (ventricular) wall stress if increased in dilated cardiomyopathy (mainly because of the dilatation of the ventricles and to a minor extent because of the relative reduction in ventricular thickness). Growth hormone seems to be capable of increasing ventricular wall thickness in dilated cardiomyopathy, thus, reducing cardiac wall stress which in turn leads to an improvement in systolic cardiac performance. Recombinant human growth hormone as a pharmacologic treatment is not only an expensive but also risky therapeutic modality (e.g., potential risk of inducing colonic carcinoma, de-novo leukemias, relapses of leukemias and central nervous system tumors). Given these prerequisites and a receptivity for cost effectiveness and risk-benefit analyses, it seems as if subcutaneous recombinant human growth hormone-as an additional therapeutic substance in conjunction with one of the widely accepted drugs for end-stage chronic congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy-e.g., angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, nitrates, digoxin, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (Carvedilol) could either become a bridge to transplantation (i.e., supporting patients awaiting transplantation) or an alternative to the very expensive cardiac transplantation. There are three reasons for this hypothesis. First, the fact that end-state dilated cardiomyopathy along with ischemic heart disease are the main indications for heart transplantation in adults; second, the worldwide small supply of human donor organs for heart transplantation; and, third, the urgent need to find alternative cost-effective and risk-beneficial therapeutic modalities.",

The ascertainment of adverse events in this study approved satisfactory, as shown by the reported incidence of cough, which was 11.3% in women and 7.8% in men, this being compatible with the best estimates of the true incidence of cough during ACE-inhibitor therapy. Serious adverse reactions-anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias-were rare.", 
    "181": "This study successfully followed a large cohort of patients treated with perindopril and failed to demonstrate any unexpected hazards.", 
    "182": "Prolonged antihypertensive therapy might be less effective in reversing the left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in uremics bearing the deleted (DD) allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene than in patients with the inserted (II) allele or in those heterozygous (ID) for the gene.", 
    "183": "Thirteen DD and 17 II + ID hemodialyzed uremics were followed-up with yearly echocardiography and 24-hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring over five years while on an antihypertensive therapy that included ACE inhibitors as first line drugs.", 
    "184": "In the II + ID group there were significant decreases of the left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and of both systolic and diastolic BPs. These changes were less pronounced in the DD group, but the difference was not statistically significant given the wide overlap between the two groups. Further analysis of the data revealed that the only factor associated to a decreased LVMi was the decrease of the systolic BP irrespective of the ACE gene genotype of each individual patient.", 
    "185": "The ACE-gene genotype does not necessarily predict the extent to which LVMi will be lowered by ACE-inhibitors therapy. The LVH of hypertensive uremics is amenable by long-term antihypertensive therapy provided that it results in significantly decreased systolic blood pressure.", 
    "186": "We previously showed that chronic administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), a model of membranous nephropathy with proteinuria and increased renal synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), reduces urinary proteins and partially limits the exaggerated ET-1 renal synthesis. Here we compared the effect of an ETA receptor antagonist and an ACE-inhibitor given as single therapies with a combination of the two drugs in uninephrectomized PHN rats.", 
    "187": "PHN was induced with a single i.v. injection of rabbit anti-Fx1A antibody in 40 male Sprague Dawley rats. To accelerate the onset of renal damage rats underwent uninephrectomy seven days later and were subsequently treated until eight months with the ETA receptor antagonist LU-135252 (50 mg/kg b.i.d. p.o.) or the ACE-inhibitor trandolapril (1 mg/kg in the drinking water) or the combination of the two drugs.", 
    "188": "Either LU-135252 or trandolapril given alone prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Combined therapy was even more effective than single drugs. While LU-135252 and trandolapril reduced proteinuria by 23 to 25%, the drug combination resulted in 45% lowering of urinary proteins. Serum creatinine was significantly decreased by the combination, but not by the single drugs. Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage were more reduced by combined therapy than by LU-135252 or trandolapril alone.", 
    "189": "These data suggest that contemporary blocking angiotensin II (Ang II) and ET-1 in an accelerated model of PHN had an additive renoprotective effect than single blocking Ang II or ET-1 and would represent a therapeutic advantage for renal disease patients who do not completely respond to ACE inhibitors.", 
    "190": "The metabolic affects of anapriline, captopril, and clophelin were studied in the blood and liver homogenates ex vivo and in vitro in experiments on intact rats and rats with alloxan diabetes. Anapriline lowered the blood lactate content in rats with diabetes and intact rats, reduced the level of glycemia in animals with marked hyperglycemia. Captopril increased the blood insulin and lactate content in rats with diabetes and the content of pyruvate in vivo. The results of the study show that the use of clophelin and anaprilin in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus is most rational.", 
    "191": "Hypertension affects a large proportion of the adult population. Subsequently any change in treatment strategy may have a drastic impact on health expenditure especially when one decides to decrease the limits of arterial pressure beyond which a treatment is started. Results of pharmaco-economic studies are often controversial because they are mainly based on an evaluation of short-term absolute risks, maybe underestimating the benefit of a treatment in younger population with mild to moderate hypertension. All groups of antihypertensive drugs are able to reduce the blood pressure and most of them can induce a light improvement of patient quality of life. Diuretics and beta-blockers have a lower cost/effectiveness ratio. ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may be preferred when other drugs are badly tolerated or when some other morbidities affect the patient.", 
    "192": "Heart failure is a challenge for modern cardiology, Common, disabling, lethal, this condition represents a major economic burden for Public Health. When patients with heart failure receive an ACE inhibitor in addition to diuretics and digoxin, they have fewer symptoms, are less frequently admitted to hospital and live longer. The currently available pharmaco-economic analyses support the use of ACE inhibitors in heart failure.", 
    "193": "Recent studies have indicated that chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase induces arterial hypertension without myocardial hypertrophy. We investigated the mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) adaptation to this condition. Also, we analyzed the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), lisinopril, in this experimental model of ventricular pressure overload. Fifty-eight Wistar rats received eight weeks of treatment with either NW-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME group, n = 19), lisinopril (LISINOPRIL group, n = 19) or the combination of both drugs (LNAMELIS group, n = 20). All results were compared to age and sex matched untreated rats (CONTROL group, n = 18). Tail-cuff blood pressure rose significantly in L-NAME treated rats (195 +/- 29 mm Hg) compared to the CONTROL (141 +/- 12 mm Hg), LISINOPRIL (97 +/- 13 mm Hg), and LNAMELIS (113 +/- 16 mm Hg) groups. There was no myocardial hypertrophy in the chronically hypertensive rats. The ventricular unstressed volume was significantly reduced in the L-NAME group (0.119 +/- 0.027 mL) compared to the CONTROL (0.158 +/- 0.026 mL) indicating a disproportional reduction in ventricular volume related to the myocardial mass. The chamber size modification resulted in a systolic stress which was comparable to the CONTROL even though the isovolumetric systolic pressure was higher. The systolic functional data indicated preserved myocardial contractility in L-NAME. LV compliance was increased in the LISINOPRIL group and myocardial passive stiffness was lower in all treated rats compared to CONTROL. We conclude that LV. adaptation to chronic pressure overload without hypertrophy involves changes in chamber geometry and myocardial diastolic mechanical properties. Also, ACEI fully prevents L-NAME induced hypertension, reduces myocyte cross-sectional area, and myocardial passive stiffness. The combination of L-NAME plus lisinopril decreases the load independent index of myocardial contractility.", 
    "194": "The nonapeptide bradykinin (BK) has been implicated as the mediator of the beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle. In the present study, the effects of chronic in vivo BK treatment of obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats, a model of glucose intolerance and severe insulin resistance, on whole body glucose tolerance and skeletal muscle glucose transport activity stimulated by insulin or contractions were investigated. BK was administered subcutaneously (twice daily at 40 microg/kg body wt) for 14 consecutive days. Compared with a saline-treated obese group, the BK-treated obese animals had significantly (P < 0.05) lower fasting plasma levels of insulin (20%) and free fatty acids (26%), whereas plasma glucose was not different. During a 1 g/kg body wt oral glucose tolerance test, the glucose and insulin responses [incremental areas under the curve (AUC)] were 21 and 29% lower, respectively, in the BK-treated obese group. The glucose-insulin index, the product of the glucose and insulin AUCs and an indirect index of in vivo insulin action, was 52% lower in the BK-treated obese group compared with the obese control group. Moreover, 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the isolated epitrochlearis muscle stimulated by a maximally effective dose of insulin (2 mU/ml) was 52% greater in the BK-treated obese group. Contraction-stimulated (10 tetani) 2-deoxyglucose uptake was also enhanced by 35% as a result of the BK treatment. In conclusion, these findings indicate that in the severely insulin-resistant obese Zucker rat, chronic in vivo treatment with BK can significantly improve whole body glucose tolerance, possibly as a result of the enhanced insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose transport activity observed in these animals.", 
    "195": "Bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (BPAE) treated with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine inhibited O-2. generation by neutrophils exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) but did not affect O-2. generated enzymatically by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO). Similar results were obtained with conditioned medium from staurosporine-pretreated BPAE. The inhibitory effects of staurosporine-treated BPAE on O-2. generation were not altered by the superoxide dismutase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine. This BPAE-derived inhibitor was continuously released from staurosporine-pretreated BPAE for at least 5 h. The exact nature of the inhibitor remains unknown, but it appears to be a positively charged molecule with molecular weight <10,000. Treatment of either BPAE or neutrophils with staurosporine or conditioned medium from staurosporine-treated BPAE prevented the neutrophil-mediated decrease in endothelium-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and cytotoxicity in BPAE. In contrast, staurosporine potentiated the H2O2- and X/XO-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity. These data suggest that staurosporine-treated endothelial cells release a soluble factor that inhibits neutrophil activation and protects endothelial cells from neutrophil-mediated injury.", 
    "196": "The type XVII collagen alpha 1 chain has been identified as a component of the type I hemidesmosome, and is thus thought to play a role in extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance and signal transduction between the cell and the ECM. We examined the expression of type XVII collagen alpha 1 chain mRNA in the mouse heart by Northern blot analysis and determined the sequential changes of its expression in different developmental stages of the heart using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Northern blotting: Total RNA was extracted from 10 adult mouse hearts by the guanidine/cesium method. Hybridization was performed with mouse cDNA for alpha 1 (XVII) collagen. RT-PCR: Total RNA was extracted from 7 embryos, 4 neonates and 8 adult mice. Reverse transcription was performed using oligo-dT primer and MMLV. Amplification was carried out in alpha 1 (XVII) collagen and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). GAPDH served as an internal control. Northern blotting revealed a 5.6 kb signal that was identical to that of the alpha 1 (XVII) of skin and transformed keratinocyte reported previously. The sequences of the PCR products were also identical to those reported. The normalized expression ratios of alpha 1 (XVII) were 0.91 +/- 0.20 in the embryonic heart, 0.36 +/- 0.20 in the neonatal heart and 0.96 +/- 0.21 in the adult heart. In conclusion, we identified the expression of type XVII collagen alpha 1 chain mRNA in the mouse heart, suggesting that the type I hemidesmosome is located in the heart. The results of the RT-PCR at different developmental stages of the heart suggest that type XVII collagen contributes not only to cardiogenesis in the embryonic stage but also to maintenance of architecture and function in the adult heart.", 
    "197": "1. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of enalapril maleate on ischemia-reperfusion injury of the myocardium, after cardioplegic arrest in isolated guinea pig hearts, in a modified Langendorff model. 2. Animals were subjected to 90 min of normothermic global ischemia, followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Cardioplegic arrest was achieved by administering St. Thomas Hospital cardioplegic solution (STHCS). 3. The hearts were randomly allocated into four groups (n=8 in each group). The first group was utilized as control. In the second group, oral pretreatment was made (0.2 mg/kg enalapril maleat was given twice a day for 10 days). In the third group, enalapril maleat (1 micromol/l) was added to STHCS. In the fourth group, hearts were arrested with enalapril maleat-enriched STHCS, and enalapril maleat-enriched (1 micromol/l) Krebs-Henseleit solution was applied during the reperfusion period. 4. Although the study groups showed better recovery of contractility than did the control group, in the last group, the hearts had the best recovery of left ventricular systolic function, where dp/dt maximum was 89.7+/-6.9% of the preischemic values. Group 1, group 2 and group 3 achieved 44.2+/-4.5%, 79.4+/-5.8% and 68.1+/-6.7% of their preischemic dp/dt values. A similar observation was found for left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP); LVDP values were 52.4+/-2.1% (in group 1), 79.6+/-2.8% (in group 2), 72.8+/-4.6% (in group 3) and 86.7+/-5.8% (in group 4) of control after reperfusion. Creatine kinase leakage was significantly lower and postischemic coronary flows were significantly higher in group 4. 5. We concluded that usage of enalapril maleat in the reperfusion period was more effective for improving myocardial recovery after cardioplegic arrest. The additional protective effects of enalapril maleat not only were by angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibition-dependent coronary vasodilation and thiol-dependent limitation of oxidative injury, but could also be related to an oxygen-free-radical-scavenging effect.", 
    "198": "Poor metabolic control, hemodynamic factors and long duration of diabetes may predispose to the development of diabetic retinopathy. Recently the hypothesis that genetic factors may play certain role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy has been also proposed. The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been the main candidate gene predisposing to the development of diabetic retinopathy. One of its polymorphisms--insertion/deletion seems to be particularly associated with long-term diabetic complications. The HLA system genes, TNF-beta gene, IGF-1 gene and PAI-1 gene are the other candidate genes. If there would be strong evidence that genetic factors play certain role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic retinopathy, the high risk diabetics could be selected and the adequate prevention could be applied.", 
    "199": "Lactose and dibasic calcium phosphate (DCP) were granulated with various concentrations of film-forming polymers by a stepwise spraying method to prepare a directly compressible matrix excipient. The film-forming polymeric latex of Eudragit RS-30D, Eudragit RL-30D, and Surelease (ethylcellulose) were used in this study as the source of the granulating materials. Better flowability and compressibility were observed for all the granulated particles than the polymer-free granules. Most tablets prepared from the polymer-granulated particles exhibited satisfactory friability of less than 1% except for those prepared from lactose particles granulated with low concentrations of ethylcellulose and from plain lactose granules. Change in tensile strength and tablet thickness were in good agreement with the plasticity of the granulating polymer. Polymer-granulated lactose and DCP provided for controlled release of captopril from matrix tablets. This investigation suggests that conventional excipients can be modified by a simple granulating procedure to provide better physical properties for being used as a matrix material.", 
    "200": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the remodeling of connective tissue as well as in disease states associated with acute and chronic inflammation or tumoral metastatic processes. Despite detailed and extensive studies of the mechanisms of lymphocyte extravasation, remarkably little is known about the expression and regulation of metalloproteinases involved in the migratory process. By using zymography and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments, we have demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B lymphocytes are able to secrete a 92-kDa metalloproteinase with gelatinolytic activity which has been purified and identified as being MMP-9. Moreover, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase was shown to be constitutively expressed by the B cells. The expression of 92-kDa gelatinase is mediated by cytokines, growth factors, lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, and the tumor promotor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Time dependence activity increased rapidly up to 24 h of incubation with lipopolysaccharide or concanavalin A stimulation while it requires a delay and more time to have an optimum effect when cytokines were the stimulating agents; transforming growth factor-beta abolished 92-kDa gelatinase production. Both staurosporine and wortmannin are inductive stimuli, and the level of MMP-9 secreted into the media is greater than that observed with other agents except concanavalin A. Elicitation of the chemotactic migration of B cells through a model basement membrane by lipopolysaccharide was shown to be correlated with gelatinase expression and inhibited by 7 mM captopril. Our study indicates that Epstein-Barr virus-B lymphocytes express 92-kDa gelatinase, the production of which can be modified by a variety of physiological and pharmacological signals which have been shown to differ according to the cell type.",

    "202": "BK was infused into the aortic flow line to obtain a final concentration of 10 nM, and the coronary, effluent was collected to quantify BK and des-Arg9-BK by competitive enzyme immunoassay. The nature of immunoreactive material was confirmed by immunograms after HPLC separation. The experiments were performed with hearts perfused at either one of the following coronary flow rates: 1, 5 or 10 ml/min.", 
    "203": "BK recovery without inhibitors was 86.3 +/- 2.9, 60.8 +/- 6.3, and 29.6 +/- 6.8% at 10, 5, and 1 ml/min, respectively. The Vmax/Km ratios at these coronary flow rates were 2.19 +/- 0.72, 4.81 +/- 0.64, and 2.59 +/- 0.33 min-1 g-1), respectively. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat (130 nM), reduced BK degradation at all flow rates. Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase with retrothiorphan (25 nM) had no effect on BK degradation. However, the combined treatment with enalapril and retrothiorphan reduced BK degradation to lower values than enalaprilat alone. The effect of enzyme inhibitors on BK recovery was inversely related to coronary flow: inhibiting BK degradation markedly increased BK recovery at 1 ml/min, but had no effect at 10 ml/min. The kininase I metabolite of BK, des-Arg9-BK, could not be detected under these experimental conditions.", 
    "204": "ACE is the major enzyme responsible for BK degradation during a single passage through the coronary bed. Neutral endopeptidase contributes to BK degradation only when ACE activity is impaired. The effect of enzyme inhibitors on the coronary concentration of BK is highly dependent on coronary flow rate.", 
    "205": "The Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, two-arm, actively controlled, multicenter, international 5-year clinical trial involving 15,000 patients. CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil, which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm. An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and 190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.", 
    "206": "The effects of captopril and hydralazine, two commonly used antihypertensive drugs, on free radical generation and the onset of apoptosis in neuron and thymocyte preparations from 10-12 day old rats have been studied. Apoptosis was induced in neurons by kainate or N-methyl-D-aspartate and in thymocytes by heat shock. Intracellular free radical production was measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, and apoptotic cells were detected by cell staining with fluorescein-labelled annexin V. Captopril was found to have no effect on intracellular free radical generation and also had no significant effect on the early stages of apoptosis in neurons and thymocytes. In contrast, hydralazine was found to decrease free radical generation in both neurons and thymocytes, and it also significantly decreased the numbers of apoptotic cells when neurons and thymocytes were stimulated for apoptosis. Hydralazine had a greater effect on decreasing free radical generation in neurons than in thymocytes, but it had a more pronounced effect on decreasing apoptosis in thymocytes compared to neurons, suggesting that apoptosis, under our experimental conditions, may not solely be triggered by free radical generation. These results contrast with earlier reports that captopril is a free radical scavenger and can decrease apoptosis in T-lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes, and the results obtained with hydralazine are in apparent disagreement with earlier reports that this drug is a free radical generator and can cause intracellular damage suggestive of enhanced free radical formation.", 
    "207": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein are cleaved from the membrane by zinc metalloproteinases termed ACE secretase and alpha-secretase, respectively. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) convertase (ADAM 17) is a recently identified member of the adamalysin family of mammalian zinc metalloproteinases that is involved in the production of TNF-alpha and possibly in the cleavage of other membrane proteins. Using two different cell-free assays we were unable to detect significant cleavage and secretion of ACE by TNF-alpha convertase. In addition, there was a different effect of three hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors (batimastat, compound 1 and compound 4) towards TNF-alpha convertase as compared to ACE secretase and alpha-secretase. Thus TNF-alpha convertase would appear to be distinct from, but possibly related to, the secretases that cleave ACE and the amyloid precursor protein.", 
    "208": "Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and premature cardiovascular death. Even mild elevations of blood pressure (i.e., diastolic blood pressure >90 and <110 mm Hg) yield increased risk. In fact, mild-to-moderate hypertension is more common than severe hypertension and accounts for a greater proportion of the deaths and serious nonfatal vascular events. The treatment goal is to make optimal use of antihypertensive drug therapy while encouraging patients to implement lifestyle changes such as weight loss, sodium restriction, decreased alcohol intake, and increased exercise. Pharmacologic therapy of mild-to-moderate hypertension can significantly reduce the incidence of stroke, MI, coronary artery disease, vascular mortality, and total mortality. Beta blockers and diuretics should continue to be used as first-line therapy until there is direct and reliable evidence from large-scale randomized trials with clinical endpoints for newer agents such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

    "213": "Cardiomyocyte apoptosis or programmed cell death has been shown to occur in end-stage explanted failed human hearts and in dogs with chronic heart failure (HF). We tested the hypothesis that early long-term monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor attenuates cardiomyocyte apoptosis in dogs with moderate HF. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction 30-40%) was produced in dogs by multiple sequential intracoronary microembolizations. Dogs were randomized to 3 mo of therapy with enalapril (Ena, 10 mg twice daily, n = 7) or to no therapy at all (control, n = 7). After 3 mo of therapy, dogs were euthanized and the hearts removed. Presence of nuclear DNA fragmentation (nDNAf), a marker of apoptosis, was assessed in frozen LV sections using the immunohistochemical deoxynucleotidal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. Sections were also stained with ventricular anti-myosin antibody to identify cells of cardiocyte origin. From each dog, 80 fields (x40) were selected at random, 40 from LV regions bordering old infarcts and 40 from LV regions remote from any infarcts, for quantifying the number of cardiomyocyte nDNAf events per 1,000 cardiomyocytes. The average number of cardiomyocyte nDNAf events per 1,000 cardiomyocytes was significantly lower in Ena-treated dogs compared with controls (0.81 +/- 0.13 vs. 2.65 +/- 0.81, P < 0.029). This difference was due to a significantly lower incidence of cardiomyocyte nDNAf events in LV regions bordering scarred tissue (infarcts) in Ena-treated dogs compared with controls. We conclude that early long-term Ena therapy attenuates cardiomyocyte apoptosis in dogs with moderate HF. Attenuation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis may be one mechanism by which ACE inhibitors preserve global LV function in HF.", 
    "214": "It is likely that the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy involves an interaction of metabolic and haemodynamic factors. Relevant metabolic factors include glucose-dependent pathways such as advanced glycation, increased formation of polyols, and activation of the enzyme, protein kinase C. Specific inhibitors of the various pathways are now available, enabling investigation of the role of these processes in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and potentially to provide new therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Haemodynamic factors to consider include systemic hypertension, intraglomerular hypertension, and the role of vasoactive hormones, such as angiotensin II. The mainstay of therapy remains attaining optimum glycaemic control. Antihypertensive therapy has a major role in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be particularly useful as renoprotective agents in both the hypertensive and normotensive context.",

Among the 3648 patients receiving antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitors (calcium-channel blockers 1416, diuretics 2099, beta-blockers 2681), the corresponding relative risks were 110 (0.97-1.22) and 1.03 (0.87-1.20).

These changes most probably represent the earliest cardiac end-organ lesions that can clinically be detected. In cardiac hypertrophy, long-term (9-12 months) pharmacotherapy with beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ACE inhibitors reverses left ventricular hypertrophy by 8% to 14%, whereas marked improvement in coronary reserve and diastolic dysfunction is achieved by calcium blocker and preferably by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "220": "Obesity is a metabolic disorder in which multiple clinical and biochemical alterations coexist. However, the progression of these alterations in relation to weight gain has not been investigated in detail. Therefore, we studied the evolution of insulin resistance and associated risk factors in a model of experimental obesity in dogs. We also studied whether chronic exposure to these pathogenic factors could induce cardiac and vascular alterations. Twenty male age- and body weight-matched beagle dogs were divided into four groups (n = 5), according to diet and pharmacologic therapy received, and followed for 2 years. Control animals were maintained with a regular diet, while the 15 remaining animals were fed a high-fat diet. The Obese group of dogs received no therapy, whereas the Capto group received 25 mg/12 h captopril, and the Prava+Capto was treated with 10 mg/24 h pravastatin plus the same dose of captopril throughout the study. Periodical determinations of clinical and biochemical parameters were made, and the degree of insulin resistance was also estimated. After the 2-year follow-up, the dogs were killed and vascular thickening in the aorta and the coronary arteries was evaluated. In addition, cardiac hypertrophy was estimated by heart weight and free-wall left ventricular width. Chronic pravastatin plus captopril treatment, together with decreasing weight gain rate, ameliorated the progression of insulin resistance and associated risk factors (hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia) related to this severe model. In addition, this combined therapy showed cardioprotective action, as cardiac and vascular hypertrophy observed in the Obese group was prevented. These positive results seems to emerge from the synergistic effects of both drugs, as captopril as monotherapy induced only a slight benefit on these parameters.", 
    "221": "The goal of treating hypertension is to maximize therapeutic efficacy without untoward side effects. The accepted approach is to start treatment with a low dose of a single drug and then titrate it upward as needed to achieve a better therapeutic effect. However, higher doses of administered individual drugs increase the frequency and severity of side effects. A rational combination of individual drugs administered in low doses is preferable because it is associated with a high degree of efficacy, low incidence or severity of side effects, and high patient compliance. The most commonly used drug combinations are as follows: (1) diuretics with potassium-sparing agents; (2) beta-adrenergic blockers with diuretics; (3) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with diuretics; (4) angiotensin II receptor blockers with diuretics; and (5) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with calcium-channel blockers.", 
    "222": "1. The various angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have structural differences which affect their affinities for the catalytic sites on converting enzyme. We postulated that such differences might result in differences in renoprotective efficacy. We investigated this in the diabetic spontaneous hypertensive rat. We also investigated whether these differences might reflect variations in glomerular or plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. 2. One week after induction of diabetes, rats were started on antihypertensive therapy: enalapril, 10 mg.day-1.kg-1, or perindopril, 4 mg.day-1.kg-1, in the drinking water. After 3 months, the rats were killed, blood samples were taken and tissues were harvested. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in isolated glomeruli and plasma was measured by fluorimetric assay. Glomerular protein content was also determined. 3. Urinary protein excretion was significantly lower in perindopril-treated rats than in either controls (P < 0.0005) or enalapril-treated rats (P < 0.05). Glomerular protein content was also lower in perindopril-treated rats (P < 0.05 versus enalapril; P < 0.005 versus control). There was no difference in glomerular angiotensin-converting enzyme activity between the two inhibitors although both were lower than control values (enalapril P < 0.025; perindopril P < 0.025). Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was significantly lower in the perindopril group than in either control (P < 0.005) or the enalapril group (P < 0.01). 4. We conclude that in the spontaneous hypertensive rat with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, perindopril is more effective than enalapril in reducing proteinuria and glomerular protein accumulation. This difference does not result from differences in glomerular-converting enzyme activity.", 
    "223": "Impaired microcirculatory perfusion appears to be crucial to the pathogenesis of both neuropathy and retinopathy in diabetics. This in turn reflects a hyperglycemically mediated perturbation of vascular endothelial function that entails overactivation of protein kinase C, reduced availability of nitric oxide, increased production of superoxide and endothelin, impaired insulin function, diminished synthesis of prostacyclin/PGE1, and increased activation and endothelial adherence of leukocytes. These dysfunctions may be addressed with a supplementation program that includes high-dose antioxidants, fish oil, gamma-linolenic acid, chromium, arginine, carnitine, and ginkgolides. Pharmaceuticals likely to be of benefit in this regard include pentoxifylline, probucol, replacement estrogens, and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and aldose reductase.", 
    "224": "Dietary sodium restriction enhances the antiproteinuric and blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibition. In clinical practice, however, long-term compliance to a low-sodium diet may be difficult to obtain. We therefore investigated whether the blunting of the antiproteinuric and blood pressure lowering efficacy of ACE inhibition by high sodium intake can be restored by the addition of a diuretic.",

Arterial baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by phenylephrine bolus. The arterial baroreflex test was re-examined 3 h after oral alacepril (37.5 mg). The tilt and arterial baroreflex tests were repeated 12 weeks after alacepril treatment (50 mg x day(-1)).", 
    "230": "Heart rate, blood pressure, and neurohormonal factors did not differ before and after chronic alacepril, except for a trend toward an increase in renin activity (2.0 vs 4.9 ng x ml(-1) x h(-1)). Head-up tilt decreased central venous pressure (-2.5 mmHg) with a decrease in cardiac dimensions in the pre-alacepril phase. These changes were accompanied by increases in noradrenaline, adrenaline, and angiotensin II and a decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide. After chronic alacepril, the increase in noradrenaline during head-up tilt tended to be smaller (84 vs 30 pg x ml(-1)), with similar changes in central venous pressure (-3.4 mmHg) and cardiac dimensions. Both acute (3.6 vs 4.8 ms mmHg(-1)) and chronic (3.6 vs 6.7 ms mmHg(-1)) alacepril treatment was associated with a trend towards an increase in the arterial baroreflex control of heart rate.",

In a previous paper, however, we reported a lower than expected use of these drugs during the period 1982 1988. In 1989 the results of this survey were presented and discussed with the prescribing physicians. In the present paper we describe the prescription patterns for the same indication and in the same centre over the following 6 years (1989-1994). We also describe the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for which efficacy in certain subgroups has been recently shown.",

Information about diagnoses, other clinical variables and treatments prescribed at discharge was obtained from the hospital discharge forms. The results were compared with those obtained in the previous study.", 
    "234": "We studied 514 patients (80% men) with a median age of 59 years (range 31-89). The proportions of patients prescribed beta-adrenergic blocking agents and acetylsalicylic acid increased from 34% and 28%, respectively, in 1986-1988, to 62% and 75% in 1989 1991. In 1994 they had reached a steady state (63% and 71%). In addition, a continued decrease in the use of calcium channel blockers was noted, from 36% in 1986-1988 to 17% in 1994. The increase in the prescription of beta-adrenergic blocking agents was especially remarkable in the subgroups for which a larger underuse was recorded in the previous study, such as the elderly. The proportion of patients prescribed an ACE inhibitor increased from 14% in 1989-1991 to 23% in 1994. In a multivariate analysis the prescription of ACE inhibitors was associated with female gender, hypertension during admission, heart failure during admission, and previous myocardial infarction. A substantial increase in the prescription of beta-adrenergic blocking agents and acetylsalicylic acid and a decrease in the prescription of calcium channel blockers was recorded between 1982 and 1994. The prescription rate of beta-adrenergic blocking agents has increased substantially in certain subgroups where underuse had been previously recorded. Most of the changes occurred in 1989-1991, and reached a steady state in 1994. In 1994 an increase in the prescription of ACE inhibitors was also recorded.",

    "236": "We determined whether antihypertensive treatment can improve EDHF-mediated responses in SHRs. Beginning at age 8 to 9 months, the animals were treated with either enalapril (40 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) (SHR-Es) or a combination of hydralazine (25 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and hydrochlorothiazide (7.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) (SHR-Hs) for 3 months. The control groups were age-matched SHRs (SHR-Cs) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs). The two treatments lowered the blood pressure to comparable extents. The acetylcholine-induced hyperpolarization in the mesenteric artery of treated SHRs improved to a level comparable to that in WKYs (acetylcholine 10(-5) mol/L with norepinephrine 10(-5) mol/L: SHR-E, -14.4 +/- 1.8; SHR-H, -12.0 +/- 1.3; SHR-C, -7.2 +/- 1.2; and WKY, -13.3 +/- 2.3 mV). EDHF-mediated relaxation, as assessed by relaxation to acetylcholine resistant to N(G)-nitro-L-arginine in norepinephrine-contracted rings, was markedly improved in treated SHRs (maximal relaxation: SHR-E, 79.3+/-3.2%; SHR-H, 47.4+/-8.6%; SHR-C, 4.8+/-2.4%; and WKY, 45.1+/-6.0%). When the rings were contracted with 77 mmol/L KCl to eliminate EDHF response, no difference was found in relaxation to acetylcholine among the four groups. Similarly, the hyperpolarization and relaxation to levcromakalim, a K+ channel opener, were comparable among the groups.", 
    "237": "Antihypertensive treatment improved EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation in the mesenteric artery in SHRs, whereas NO-mediated relaxation did not appear to be modulated by drug therapy. Thus, alterations in the EDHF system may play a pivotal role in endothelial dysfunction and its improvement with drug therapy in SHRs.", 
    "238": "Antiatherogenic effects of imidapril and involvement of renin angiotensin system were examined in experimental atherosclerosis induced by feeding a high-cholesterol diet to Cynomolgus monkeys. Eighteen male monkeys were divided into three groups and placed under (1) normal diet (normal group), (2) high-cholesterol diet (control group), (3) high-cholesterol diet with imidapril (20 mg/kg body wt/day, orally) treatment (imidapril group). At the end of the experiment, the normal group showed no apparent atherosclerosis in their aorta evaluated by oil red-O staining, while the control group exhibited marked atherosclerotic involvement of the intimal surface of the aorta (58.4 +/- 9.3%, P < 0.01). Imidapril reduced systolic blood pressure and atherosclerotic involvement (24.1 +/- 5.5%, P < 0.05). Total cholesterol content of the descending thoracic aorta was also significantly reduced in the imidapril group. In the atherosclerotic vessels, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity evaluated by quantitative in vitro autoradiography was significantly increased in the intimal lesion. Further evaluation revealed angiotensin II (Ang II) type I (AT1) receptor density was significantly increased in the medial lesion and type II (AT2) receptor density in the adventitia. When the progression of atherosclerosis was impeded by imidapril treatment, the ACE activity level as well as the AT1 and AT2 receptor density remained at normal. Expression of mRNA for fibronectin, TGF-beta1, types I and III collagen was studied by Northern blot analysis. No significant differences in types I and III collagen mRNA levels were found between the control and imidapril group. On the other hand, mRNA expression for fibronectin and TGF-beta1 were much lower in the imidapril group than in the control group. These results suggest that increased production of Ang II and activated receptors may be involved in atherosclerotic process in this model and also antiatherogenic effect of imidapril may be derived from reduction of local Ang II production as well as its hypotensive action.",

Over a 6-month period, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition therapy resulted in significant reductions in left ventricular volumes and mass in association with a minor reduction in regurgitant fraction.", 
    "240": "Left ventricular (LV) systolic function is partly determined by severity of coronary artery disease and is improved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, at least in post-infarct patients. Because the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism is associated with circulating and tissue ACE activity, we sought to evaluate the role of this genetic variant on LV function in patients studied with coronary angiography, taking into account coronary vessel anatomy and history of infarction. Coronary artery disease extent scores, coronary artery patency, and LV ejection fraction were assessed in 400 consecutive Caucasian patients referred for established or suspected ischemic heart disease. A previous infarction had occurred in 141 patients an average of 3.7 years before the study. The ACE DD genotype, compared with the ACE ID/II genotype, was associated with a 2.7% higher ejection fraction in noninfarct patients (p = 0.047) but a 5.0% lower ejection fraction in post-infarct patients (p = 0.047). An interaction effect between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism, the infarction status, and LV ejection fraction was observed in the whole population (p = 0.003), in patients with no disease and 1-, 2-, and 3-vessel diseases (p = 0.03 and p = 0.06, respectively), and in those with chronically occluded coronary vessels (p = 0.02). The influence of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism on LV function is modulated by infarction status and coronary anatomy.", 
    "241": "Adriamycin has a wide spectrum of antitumor activity with dose related cardiotoxicity as a major side effect. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of captopril, a sulphydryl containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the cardio- and hematotoxicity of adriamycin in normal rats. A single dose of adriamycin (15 mg/kg) caused myocardial toxicity after 24 h manifested biochemically by elevation of serum enzymes:- Aspartate transaminase (AST, EC: 2.6.1.1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC: 1.1.1.27), creatine phosphokinase (CPK, EC: 2.7.3.2) and the cardiac iso-enzymes of LDH and CPK. The hematotoxicity was characterized by severe leukopenia and anemia that appeared after 72 h of adriamycin administration. Captopril (60 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before adriamycin injection ameliorated the biochemical toxicity induced by adriamycin. This was evidenced by a significant reduction in serum enzymes, after 24 and 48 h and a significant reduction of serum cardiac iso-enzymes after 48 h. Also restoration of the white blood cell counts as well as hemoglobin concentration occurred after 72 h of captopril administration. These results suggest that captopril may be benificial as a protective agent against cardio- and hematotoxicity induced by adriamycin.",

Considering serial consecutive evaluations, a hemodynamic improvement was obtained only with inotropics in 13 (group A), and with vasodilators in only 15 (group B).

In both groups there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in cardiac output (CO)-from 3.9 +/- 1.1 to 4.9 +/- 1.4 L/min in group A, and from 3.9 +/- 1.2 to 4.4 +/- 1.2 L/min in group B. CO increased 18.7% in group A and 13.8% in group B (NS). There was a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) from 19.5 +/- 6.0 to 15.1 +/- 5.8 mm Hg in group A (p < 0.05), and from (16.9 +/- 5.7 to 12.1 +/- 4.6 mm Hg in group B (p < 0.05). PCWP decreased 19.7% in group A and 27.8% in group B (NS).

    "246": "Angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of hypertension. They are specific for the renin-angiotensin system, selective for the angiotensin AT1 receptor, and act independently of the angiotensin II synthetic pathway. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system at the receptor level should therefore be more complete. The high circulating levels of angiotensin II following angiotensin AT1 receptor blockade could be beneficial in stimulating other unblocked angiotensin receptors, especially the AT2 receptor. It has been proposed that the angiotensin AT2 receptor, which is re-expressed or up-regulated during pathological circumstances, counterbalances the effect of the stimulation of the angiotensin AT1 receptor. Through this mechanism, angiotensin AT1 antagonists may be superior to ACE inhibitors in cardiac and vascular remodelling as well as in kidney insufficiency. Long-term trials are required to demonstrate the possible clinical superiority of this new class of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "247": "The purpose of these studies was to compare the effects of CGS 30440 (CGS), a dual angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (NEPI) to benazepril (BZ), an ACEI, in a model of five-sixths nephrectomy. The doses of BZ and CGS 30440 tested were 6.5 micromol/kg/day and 2.2 micromol/kg/day. Drugs or vehicle (V) were administered subcutaneously for 6 weeks with dosing initiated 1 week after renal mass reduction. At 6 weeks of receiving drug (7 weeks after five-sixths nephrectomy), CGS/6.5 and BZ/6.5 and CGS/2.2 maintained systolic blood pressures (SBP) at presurgical values. BZ/2.2 did not reduce SBP and was similar to the V group. Urinary protein excretion increased >10-fold in the V-treated group. BZ, at either dose, reduced the proteinuria slightly. CGS/6.5 and CGS/2.2 caused significant (p < 0.05) reductions in proteinuria. Creatinine clearance (Cr(cl)), was reduced by 82% in V, 65 and 61% in the CGS/6.5 and CGS/2.2 groups, and by 69 and 74% in the BZ/6.5 and BZ/2.2 groups, respectively. Both CGS treatments improved the fractional excretion of Na+ (%FE(Na)) significantly from the BZ and V groups. The %FE(Na) for BZ at either dose did not differ from that of V. Elevated urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), an indicator suggesting increased intrarenal levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), was observed only in the CGS groups. Histologic examination indicated that BZ/6.5 reduced glomerular sclerosis and the extent of tubular dilation, whereas BZ/2.2 had little effect. CGS, especially at the high dose, virtually normalized the glomerular and tubular pathology. Compared with BZ, CGS 30440 treatment further diminished tubular dilation and proteinaceous cast formation. These tubular effects are consistent with some of the renal actions of ANP. The results from these studies indicate that CGS 30440, a combined ACEI/NEPI, conferred a greater renal protective effect than did ACE inhibition alone.", 
    "248": "This study investigated the effects of myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac failure and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/kg/day) on rat beta-adrenoceptor (beta-ar) subtypes in anatomically defined regions of infarcted left ventricular (LV) free wall and noninfarcted tissue from right ventricle (RV) by using autoradiography. After 5 weeks of MI, rats with large MI size (>42%) had developed cardiac failure and beta1-ars were significantly decreased (-59%; p < 0.01) in the border region of the infarcted LV and almost abolished in the infarcted area (-90%; p < 0.005) compared with normal LV from sham-operated controls. The beta-ar changes were not found in the noninfarcted area of the same LV or in RV. MI did not significantly alter the number of beta2-ar subtypes in any region of the ventricles. Perindopril treatment for 4 weeks reduced mean cardiac region weights but did not affect beta-ar density in any cardiac region in either sham-operated or MI rats. These results indicate that cardiac failure due to MI causes significant downregulation of beta1-ars only in border and infarcted regions of rat LV and no change in beta2-ar in any area. It also suggests that the improved response of the infarcted rat heart to isoprenaline stimulation after ACE inhibitors does not result from changes in the numbers of cardiac beta-ars.", 
    "249": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) reduce experimental atherosclerosis by different mechanisms. To determine whether dual-drug therapy additively retards the progression of early lesions, control hyperlipidemic hamsters were compared with those treated with pravastatin, captopril, and pravastatin plus captopril. After 8 weeks of treatment, pravastatin (34 mg/kg/day) reduced plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides by 41 and 84%, respectively, whereas captopril (100 mg/kg/day) reduced normal blood pressure by 21%. The combination of pravastatin and captopril (33 and 100 mg/kg/day) decreased plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides by 44 and 84%, and blood pressure was decreased by 14%. In the aortic arch, pravastatin reduced macrophage-foam cell size and fatty streak area by 21 and 31%, respectively, whereas captopril decreased macrophage-foam cell number and fatty streak area by 34 and 35%. Pravastatin plus captopril decreased macrophage-foam cell number, foam cell size, and fatty streak area by 38, 24, and 67%. ACE inhibitors were previously reported to retard atherosclerosis without affecting blood pressure, suggesting that these agents acted on the artery wall. Therefore the expression of arterial ACE was determined in normal and atherosclerotic hamster aortas. ACE messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were detected in endothelial cells, intimal macrophage-foam cells and medial smooth-muscle cells of atherosclerotic arteries indicating an upregulation of ACE expression with hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. In conclusion, dual-therapy with pravastatin and captopril produced an additive reduction in fatty streak area compared with either drug alone and suggested that atherogenesis can be retarded beyond the level achieved with monotherapy. The presence of ACE in endothelial cells and intimal macrophage-foam cells provides cellular targets for captopril to directly modify the formation of early atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "250": "Angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent one of the most important pharmacological instruments for the treatment of arterial hypertension and are currently also used for other cardiovascular indications. The actions of ACE-inhibitors mainly depends on blocking the ACE enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, the ACE enzyme also has a kinase activity. The inhibition of this enzyme may also cause an accumulation of tissue mediators (bradykinin) responsible for a number of adverse reactions.", 
    "251": "An intensive hospital monitoring programme of adverse reactions to drugs, known as MIO[symbol: see text]'96, was carried out by the Centre of Pharmacoepidemiology of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery at the Second University of Naples during the period 25 March-18 April 1996. The main aims of the programme were to highlight the incidence of adverse reactions to the drugs monitored and the definition of the risk/benefit ratio taking account of the main physiological and pathophysiological variations of patients. This paper reports the results of the programme of adverse effects correlated to the use of ACE-inhibitors. A total of 175 records were compiled for 105 patients receiving antihypertensive treatment with a number of ACE-inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, lisinopril); a very high mean incidence of adverse events was documented (22%) without any severe undesirable effects.", 
    "252": "The following adverse events were documented (the cumulative incidence is given in brackets): dysgeusia (17%), flush (8%), headache (33%), exanthema (17%), diarrhoea (8%), vertigo (8%), xerostomia (8%). Coughing was not reported in any patient.",

    "254": "In this study the mechanisms were investigated whereby ACE-inhibitors improve pulmonary diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLco) in chronic heart failure. The two subcomponents of DLco are the alveolar-capillary membrane conductance (DM) and the capillary blood volume (VC). Stress failure of the membrane in chronic heart failure provides a mechanism for reduction of DM and, as a consequence, impairment of DLco. In 27 patients with chronic heart failure in NYHA functional class II to III and in 13 age- and sex-matched normal subjects, we evaluated the pulmonary function and determined DM and VC, according to the classic Roughton and Forster method, while they were given placebo, at 48 hours and 8 weeks after starting enalapril treatment (10 mg bid). ACE-inhibition had no effect in controls at both short- and mid-term. In chronic heart failure patients, a reduction in VC (likely consequence of a decrease in capillary pulmonary pressure) was the only change observed at 48 hours. At 8 weeks, DM was greatly increased even when the effective alveolar volume (VA) was accounted for (DM/VA), resulting in a significant improvement in DLco, despite a decrease in VC. The slow onset DM improvement makes it likely that the modulatory effect of ACE-inhibition on the membrane function emerges gradually, suggesting that it is likely dissociated from changes in pulmonary capillary pressure and VC. Thus, derangements of the alveolar-capillary membrane in chronic heart failure increase gas diffusion resistance; ACE-inhibition restores the diffusive properties of the membrane and gas transfer, and protects the lung when the heart is failing.", 
    "255": "Cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction and in chronic hypertension involves an increase in the synthesis and deposition of collagen within the myocardium. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors limit hypertrophy and fibrosis; their mechanism of action remains controversial, although kinins have been implicated to play a role. Because both bradykinin and prostaglandins (PG) have been shown to reduce collagen gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts, the goal of this study was to determine whether the bradykinin effect was mediated through enhanced prostaglandin formation by cardiac fibroblasts. Bradykinin increased [3H]arachidonic acid metabolite release 2.3-fold over control and stimulated a dose-dependent increase in 6-keto PGF1alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2) release from these cells, in which 1 nmol/L bradykinin produced a 4-fold increase in 6-keto PGF1alpha release. Beraprost (a PGI2 analogue) reduced steady-state proalpha1(I) and proalpha1(III) collagen mRNA levels by 35.6+/-6.6% and 34.2+/-10.0%, respectively. Bradykinin-induced reductions in collagen type I and III gene expression were reversed by pretreatment with indomethacin. Our results indicate that one mechanism by which bradykinin modulates collagen biosynthesis via the rabbit cardiac fibroblast involves formation of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly PGI2. The results of the present study argue that stabilization of endogenous kinins (as by ACE inhibitors) would enhance prostacyclin production and result in the attenuation of collagen gene expression, with potential implications for collagen synthesis and deposition within the myocardium.", 
    "256": "Endothelial function has been shown to be impaired in patients with essential hypertension. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether antihypertensive drug therapy improves impaired endothelium-dependent renal vasorelaxation in essential hypertensive patients without atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effects of intravenous infusion of L-arginine (500 mg/kg given over 30 minutes) on systemic and renal hemodynamics in 27 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril or the calcium antagonist amlodipine for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. After the 12 weeks, the decrease in blood pressure was similar in the imidapril (n=14) and amlodipine (n=13) groups. The increase in renal plasma flow was also similar in both groups. L-Arginine-induced renovascular relaxation was increased by imidapril (renal plasma flow, 9.6+/-5.1% to 14.4+/-7.4%; renal vascular resistance, -10.4+/-8.1% to -16.7+/-9.2%, P<0.05, respectively) but not by amlodipine. Urinary excretion of nitrite/nitrate in response to L-arginine was significantly increased by imidapril (90+/-29% to 134+/-63%, P<0.05) but remained unchanged by amlodipine. These findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition improves the impaired endothelium-dependent renovascular relaxation in patients with essential hypertension due to the increase in nitric oxide production and that the reduction in blood pressure with a calcium antagonist does not play a major role in the potentiation of L-arginine/nitric oxide-mediated effects.",

    "259": "Patients with mitral insufficiency, in sinus rhythm, with a heart failure grade II or III and with echocardiographic left ventricular dilatation were eligible for the study. They received sequentially, during 12 weeks each, digoxin 0.25 mg/day or enalapril in doses up to 20 mg/day, with a washout in-between period of 2 weeks. The order of the sequence was determined randomly. At the start and end of treatment, functional class according to NYHA and maximal exercise tolerance in the treadmill were assessed and a color Doppler echocardiogram was done to measure ventricular dimensions, function and degree of mitral insufficiency.", 
    "260": "Nine patients on enalapril and 12 on digoxin improved their functional capacity. Digoxin improved exercise time in 76 +/- 168 sec (p = 0.022), whereas this change was not significant with enalapril (38 +/- 158 sec; p = 0.2). With enalapril treatment, ventricular diastolic dimension decreased from 59.3 +/- 8.1 to 58 +/- 9.3 mm and the area of mitral insufficiency decreased from 8.1 +/- 3.5 to 6.6 +/- 3.1 cm2. Digoxin did not induce any significant echocardiographic change.",

    "262": "The aim was to determine: 1) whether Enalaprilat (0.08 mg/kg/min) administration: a) before ischemia or b) at the beginning of reperfusion improved the postischemic systolic and diastolic dysfunction (\"stunned myocardium\") and attenuated the \"hyperfunction\" phase at the beginning of reperfusion; and 2) whether creatine kinase (CPK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, and lactate release are involved in the protective effects of Enalaprilat. An isolated isovolumic rabbit heart preparation was used as experimental model and subjected to 15 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, without (group 1), and with Enalaprilat before the ischemia (group 2) and at the beginning of reperfusion (group 3). Left ventricular developed pressure, and end diastolic pressure (diastolic stiffness) were measured and the time constant of isovolumic relaxation (t, Tau) and the ratio between +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmax were calculated. For the determinations of lactate release and CPK and LDH activities in the perfusate, samples were taken from the coronary effluent for spectrophotometrical measurements. In comparison to the stunned group (group 1) both Enalaprilat preischemia (group 2) and postischemia (group 3) exerted a significant protective effect on the postischemic recovery of contractile state and diastolic stiffness, and attenuated the \"hypercontractile\" phase in both groups. However Enalaprilat failed to improve myocardial relaxation. Lactate release was also attenuated, but the enzyme activities were not modified.", 
    "263": "The goals of stable angina pectoris treatment are: (i) symptom relief and increase in angina-free walking time; and (ii) reduction of mortality and adverse outcome. Strategies used for plaque stabilisation resulting in a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are: smoking cessation; aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid); blood pressure control; lipid lowering agents when low density lipoprotein cholesterol is elevated despite dietary therapy; coronary bypass surgery in patients with left main stem disease or triple vessel coronary disease and diminished left ventricular function; and use of estrogen in postmenopausal women. For symptom relief and to increase angina-free walking time, long acting nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and potassium channel openers can be used. Drugs from these 3 classes are all effective when used optimally and choice of initial therapy should consider the presence of concomitant disease and underlying left ventricular function. However, none of the long acting nitrates provide continuous prophylaxis because nitrate tolerance develops during long term therapy. In patients with uncomplicated stable angina, nitrates, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are all effective. Intermittent nitrate therapy is not associated with tolerance, but headache is a common adverse effect and the patient is unprotected at night and in the early hours of the morning. Concomitant treatment with a beta-blocker may be beneficial if the patient experiences withdrawal or early morning angina. For patients with stable angina and hypertension, therapy with a beta-blocker or a calcium antagonist rather than nitrate is indicated. beta-Blockers are preferred in patients who have had a myocardial infarction, or in those with a history of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. beta-Blockers may produce excessive slowing of the heart rate, fatigue and bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Calcium antagonists are indicated as initial therapy when beta-blockers are either not tolerated or contraindicated. beta-Blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists should not be used in patients with sinus bradycardia and those with greater than first degree atrioventricular (AV) block because of the possibility of further slowing of heart rate and/or the development of high grade AV block. When monotherapy with one class is ineffective or associated with adverse effects, the patient should be switched to another class rather than given an additional drug. Optimal monotherapy is often as effective as combination therapy. If maximum monotherapy is only partially effective, a combination therapy which is not additive in terms of adverse effects should be chosen. Triple therapy may be deleterious and no more effective than dual therapy.", 
    "264": "Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics principally affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Changes in pharmacodynamics are primarily seen in the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine system. Age-dependent changes in the kinetics and dynamics of drugs acting on the cardiovascular system and central nervous system are common, and this review, while by no means exhaustive of the effects of drugs on all organ systems, is reflective of the principles and gives examples of the effects of age on these 2 major systems. While pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly are usually well characterised, pharmacodynamic changes are understood only in the most preliminary way. There has been relatively little research in this area of geriatric clinical pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic changes are still an area of investigation.", 
    "265": "Stimulating cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors with oxyfedrine causes dilatation of coronary vessels and positive inotropic effects on the myocardium. beta 1-adrenergic agonists increase coronary blood flow in nonstenotic and stenotic vessels. The main indication for the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors pamrinone, mirinone, enoximone and piroximone is acute treatment of severe congestive heart failure. Theophylline is indicated for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, apnea in preterm infants ans sleep apnea syndrome. Severe arterial occlusive disease associated with atherosclerosis can be beneficially affected by elcosanoids. These drugs must be administered parenterally and have a half-life of only a few minutes. Sublingual or buccal preparations of nitrates are the only prompt method (within 1 or 2 min) of terminating anginal pain, except for biting nifedipine capsules. The short half-life (about 2.5 min) of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) makes long term therapy impossible. Tolerance is a problem encountered with longer-acting nitric oxide donors. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of vasodilating drugs can prevent a too sudden and severe blood pressure decrease in patients with chronic hypertension. In considering the administration of a second dose, or another drug, the time necessary for the initially administered drug to reach maximal efficacy should be taken into account. In hypertensive emergencies urapidil, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, hydralazine and phentolamine are the drugs of choice, with the addition of beta-blockers during catecholamine crisis or dissecting aortic aneurysm. Childhood hypertension is most often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium antagonists, primarily nifedipine. Because of the teratogenic risk involved with ACE inhibitors, extreme caution must be exercised when prescribing for adolescent females. The propagation of health benefits to breast-fed infants, combined with more women delaying pregnancy until their fourth decade, has entailed an increase in the need for hypertension management during lactation. Low dose hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, nifedipine and enalapril or captopril do not pose enough of a risk of preclude breastfeeding in this group. The most frequently used antihypertensive agents during pregnancy are methyldopa, labetalol and calcium channel antagonists. Methyldopa and beta-blockers are the drugs of choice for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Prazosin and hydralazine are used to treat moderate to severe hypertension and hydralazine, urapidil or labetalol are used to treat hypertensive emergencies. The use of overly aggressive antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy should be avoided so that adequate uteroplacental blood flow is maintained. Methyldopa is the only drug accepted for use during the first trimester of pregnancy.",

Many patients with intermittent claudication improve or remain stable without therapy if they attempt to alter their risk factors (e.g., control of diabetes, smoking cessation, lowering of cholesterol levels). However, many require concomitant drug therapy to alleviate symptoms of PVD, and some require surgical intervention. Even with the recent advances in therapeutic development and the promise of agents currently in clinical trials, the questions of who to treat, when treatment should begin, and which agent to use remain uncertain.", 
    "272": "1. We set out to develop a simple, rapid, highly sensitive and reproducible assay to quantify total angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in serum and tissues after ACE inhibition. 2. Total ACE was measured by dissociating ACE inhibitor from the enzyme using zinc chelation (EDTA). The enzyme reconstituted with zinc ion (ZnSO4) was then measured by enzymatic fluorimetric assay. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was produced in vitro by incubation of enalaprilat or perindoprilat with human serum or cell membranes from rat heart. To achieve the highest recovery rate, we studied concentrations of EDTA from 1 to 300 mmol/L with a pH range from 4 to 13, where the incubation times of EDTA were between 1 and 12 h. After washing off ACE inhibitor and excess EDTA, the resulting concentrates and pellets were then resuspended with Tris buffer containing ZnSO4 to restore ACE activity. 3. The optimal assay conditions to dissociate the drug from the enzyme were 300 mmol/L EDTA in Tris buffer at pH 11 for 12 h with cell membranes and 23 mmol/L EDTA at the same pH incubated for 4 h with serum. The recovery of ACE activity was 81.7 +/- 15.8 and 97.3 +/- 2.9% in tissues and serum, respectively. Intra- and interassay variability coefficients were 5.6 and 12.8% in tissue, respectively, 3.2 and 13.0% in serum, respectively. The method allows quantification of ACE in 100 microliters or less serum and 20 mg or less tissue. 4. The total ACE concentration after ACE inhibition can be determined by this assay, which is suitable for micro-sampling studies of both tissue and serum ACE levels.", 
    "273": "1. Previous work has shown that enalaprilat, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), potentiated the actions of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists; it was hypothesized that angiotensin II (AngII) modulated the activity of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. This hypothesis was tested in Sprague-Dawley rat isolated perfused tail arteries using the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan and the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319. 2. Losartan had no alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist effects at concentrations below 1 mumol/L. Similarly, losartan (0.1 mumol/L) had no effect on the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist action of doxazosin (1, 10 nmol/L) nor on the potentiation of doxazosin by enalaprilat (1 mumol/L). 3. PD123319 (0.1 mumol/L) had no alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist effect but altered the mode of action of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist doxazosin: PD123319 changed doxazosin from a competitive to a non-competitive antagonist, as evidenced by the reduced slope of the dose-response curve for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. 4. These results suggest that AngII can modulate alpha 1-adrenoceptor function in rat tail arteries via an indirect action at AT2 receptors. However, the present results do not rule out the involvement of bradykinin, endothelin or prostaglandin in the modulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptor function by angiotensin II.", 
    "274": "Renovascular hypertension resulting from renal artery stenosis is a potentially curable form of secondary hypertension. Although uncommon in the general hypertensive population, the prevalence of renovascular hypertension rises in selected groups of hypertensive patients. Because of the possibility of cure, screening measures for renal artery stenosis are warranted in hypertensive patients with clinical features suggestive of renovascular disease. For a long time, angiography has been considered the 'gold standard' in screening for arterial stenosis. However, it is invasive and associated with inherent morbidity. Thus, less invasive screening measures with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are currently being sought. Magnetic resonance angiography and captopril renal scintigraphy are safer alternatives to angiography, but are expensive and not widely available. Duplex ultrasound is more widely available and provides both anatomic and functional assessment of renal artery stenosis; however, sensitivity and specificity vary considerably among different laboratories. Echo-enhanced duplex ultrasound using the galactose-based agent Levovist(R) produces higher quality images of the renal artery than conventional color Doppler, while significantly reducing mean examination time and improving diagnostic confidence. In addition, Levovist does not compromise the safety of duplex ultrasound. Other advances in Doppler imaging techniques that may improve ultrasound sensitivity and specificity in detection of renal artery stenosis are power Doppler, echo-enhanced harmonic spectral Doppler imaging, and echo-enhanced harmonic power Doppler imaging.", 
    "275": "Cardioprotective effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and ramiprilat were studied in two in vivo canine models of myocardial ischemic injury: 90 min of regional ischemia with 18 h reperfusion (protocol I) and 6 h of continuous ischemia without reperfusion (protocol II). In protocol I, neither ramiprilat (50 micrograms/kg) nor captopril (5 mg/kg + 0.25 mg/kg/h) reduced infarct size after 18 h of reperfusion (vs. controls). In protocol II, drugs were administered directly into both left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex branch. Compared to controls, continuous intracoronary administration of ramiprilat (40 ng/kg/min) or captopril (400 ng/kg/min) did not reduce infarct size. Thus neither captopril nor ramiprilat protected the heart from injury under conditions of ischemia with reperfusion or ischemia without reperfusion.", 
    "276": "Evidence suggests that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a multifunctional cytokine, induces renal extracellular matrix production and glomerular hypertrophy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of captopril on the expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA in a rat model of chronic renal failure: five-sixths nephrectomy. Chronic renal disease was induced by removal of the right kidney and ligation of three blood vessels supplying the left kidney. Sham-operated animals were used as controls. RNA was extracted from the viable remnant kidney of rats 1 day and 1 and 2 weeks following five-sixths nephrectomy and from the kidneys of rats who underwent sham surgery. TGF-beta 1 mRNA was induced within 24 h of partial nephrectomy, similar to that reported for early-onset genes. Subsequently, TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression continued to increase over the next 2-4 weeks. The upregulation of TGF-beta 1 correlated with the degree of proteinuria. Both the increase in TGF-beta 1 mRNA and proteinuria were abrogated by captopril treatment. In addition, no change in expression of ALK-5 or type II TGF-beta receptors following five-sixths nephrectomy was observed. These data suggest that captopril may protect against development of glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria by reducing TGF-beta 1 expression and hence matrix production.", 
    "277": "The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on clusterin mRNA was examined in partially nephrectomized male rats. Urine protein excretion was measured 3, 7, and 28 days after removal of five sixths of the renal mass. Nephrectomy caused a progressive increase in clusterin mRNA levels in the remnant kidney. Maximal clusterin mRNA levels occurred 7 days after nephrectomy and declined 28 days after nephrectomy. Captopril, 250 mg/ml in drinking water, prevented the injury-induced increase in clusterin mRNA at 7 and 28 days. Captopril had no effect on clusterin in sham-operated rats. As expected, the urine protein excretion increased progressively after nephrectomy, and this was attenuated by administration of captopril in the drinking water. Therefore, clusterin is a marker of renal injury which, along with proteinuria, is modulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "278": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have immunomodulatory functions and can suppress a number of proinflammatory, monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines. Interleukin-12 is a cytokine produced primarily by monocytes and macrophages, which plays an essential role in cell mediated immunity and stimulates the development of T helper type 1 immune responses. In this study, we investigated the ability of ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril, to suppress IL-12 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We show that both ACE inhibitors significantly inhibit production of IL-12 by PBMC stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC). Although both ACE inhibitors also suppressed IFN-gamma production by human anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated T-cells, the addition of exogenous IFN-gamma to the PBMC stimulation medium does not abrogate the ability of ACE inhibitors to suppress IL-12 production. Inhibition of IL-12 was not associated with inhibition of IL-1beta, but correlated with the suppression of ACE. Therefore, suppression of IL-12 may contribute to the immunomodulatory effect of ACE inhibitors and may be responsible for the beneficial effect of captopril and other ACE inhibitors in inflammatory or autoimmune conditions in which IL-12 is involved.", 
    "279": "A 66-year-old hypertensive male with acute intracerebral hemorrhage developed acute hyponatremic coma 3 days after the addition of enalapril and a combination of amiloride and a thiazide diuretic to his hypotensive regimen. The patient recovered consciousness and serum sodium normalized 2 days after fluid restriction and withdrawal of both medications. Three weeks later, upon inadvertent reinstitution of enalapril and indapamide, severe hyponatremic encephalopathy promptly recurred; recovery was again rapid following fluid restriction and withdrawal of both medications. This temporal relationship establishes the thiazide diuretic or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or both as the cause of the profound symptomatic hyponatremia in this patient. Results of simultaneous serum and urine osmolality assays on several occasions were consistent with a decrease in free water clearance, a result of either increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or potentiation of its peripheral action, and thiazide-induced natriuresis. The use of a thiazide diuretic in the presence of either of these aberrations of ADH homeostasis most likely explains the profound and rapid development of hyponatremia. Drug-induced disturbances in serum osmolality are a potentially reversible cause of deterioration of the mental state in a patient with an acute cerebrovascular accident.", 
    "280": "The mechanism by which ACE-Is (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) reduces the rate of coronary thrombosis among patients with left ventricular dysfunction is not known. A potential interaction between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the thrombotic process has been suggested. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the antithrombotic action of drugs which block the RAS by different mechanisms; captopril (50 mg/kg p.o.)-the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and losartan (30 mg/kg p.o.)-the selective AT1 receptor antagonist. The normotensive rats were treated in acute or chronic manner (7 days) and then the arterial thrombosis was induced by insertion of a loop-shaped cannula into the abdominal aorta. The occlusion time (the period during which the loop was totally occluded by thrombus) was significantly prolonged in comparison with the control groups after chronic treatment with captopril (by 46%; p < 0.01) and losartan (by 42%; p < 0.05). Our results provide experimental evidence that the drugs blocking RAS exert an antithrombotic effect in the arterial thrombosis model in rats. This effect was independent from changes in blood pressure and primary hemostasis.", 
    "281": "Although it is clear that hypertension accelerates the rate of progression of most forms of chronic renal disease, many unanswered questions remain concerning how to optimally preserve kidney function in patients with hypertension and renal insufficiency. The mechanisms by which hypertension accelerates progression of renal disease have been extensively studied in experimental models. Glomerular capillary hypertension, consequent to an increase in systemic blood pressure combined with a reduction in preglomerular resistance and/or an increase in postglomerular resistance, results in increased hydraulic stress to the glomerular capillary wall. This and other mechanisms result in the release of growth-promoting cytokines and soluble mediators of fibrosis that stimulate cellular proliferation and matrix accumulation, ultimately leading to glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Almost without exception, studies in animals demonstrate that blood pressure reduction reduces the rate of progression of experimental renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, possibly, calcium antagonists may have a therapeutic advantage compared with other antihypertensive drugs in preventing kidney damage. This has been linked to both blood pressure-dependent and -independent actions. However, most experimental studies have failed to reduce blood pressure to a level sufficient to establish the clinical relevance of potential blood pressure-independent effects. Experimental studies comparing various types of antihypertensive drugs in which a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of approximately 92 mm Hg is achieved are necessary to determine whether clinically important differences in the effects of these drugs on the rate of progression of renal disease exist. Clinical experience with high blood pressure and kidney disease in humans suggests that the risk of developing hypertension-associated renal disease is a continuous variable across the entire range of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Logically, optimal protection of kidney function may therefore be a continuous function of declining systemic blood pressure. Consistent with this view, recent clinical trials suggest that reducing MAP to 92 mm Hg, corresponding to a blood pressure reading of 125/75 mm Hg, provides more optimal stabilization of renal function in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric kidney disease (>1 g/d) compared with more conventional therapy with a blood pressure goal of 140/90 mm Hg (MAP 107 mm Hg). Clinical trials in patients with diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency also demonstrate the benefits of reducing blood pressure to approximately 95 mm Hg MAP. Dietary salt consumption may be another important variable affecting the rate of progression of renal disease due to both direct, salt-dependent effects on renal growth and the action of decreased salt intake to augment the antihypertensive and antiproteinuric properties of many drugs. The precise role of alterations in dietary salt consumption on progression of renal disease directly as well as on the effectiveness of various antihypertensive drugs has yet to be examined in clinical trials.", 
    "282": "Hypertension is a known risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. However, in most of the studies, no effect of blood pressure reduction was demonstrated on the incidence of coronary artery disease, except in the SHEP study in which it was shown that in older persons, with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment reduced the incidence of total stroke and major cardiovascular event. In hypertensive patients with elevated plasma renin activity, a 5-fold increased incidence of myocardial infarction was demonstrated. As oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) was suggested to be a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, we studied the relationship between hypertension and LDL oxidation. We demonstrated increased propensity of LDL obtained from hypertensive patients to oxidative modification, in comparison with LDL obtained from normotensive subjects and suggested that angiotensin II (Ang-II) may be involved in this effect. Ang-II was shown to enhance macrophage lipid peroxidation both in vivo and in vitro. This effect was dose-dependent and involved the binding of Ang-II to its receptor on the macrophage surface. In addition, these lipid peroxidized Ang-II-treated macrophages could substantially oxidize LDL. Ang-II was shown to possess additional atherogenic properties such as increasing the activity of the macrophage oxidized LDL receptors. It also binds to LDL, thus leading to the formation of a modified lipoprotein, which is taken up by macrophages at enhanced rate through the scavenger receptor. Inhibition of Ang-II formation by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduced LDL peroxidation in hypertensive patients as well as in the atherosclerotic apo E deficient mice. The reduction in LDL peroxidation in these mice was accompanied by a 70-90% reduction in the atherosclerotic lesion area. A similar effect in these mice was demonstrated with the Ang-II receptor antagonist, Losartan. Thus, we suggest that Ang-II is involved in the development of atherogenesis in hypertensive patients and inhibition of Ang-II formation or prevention of its interaction with its receptor may attenuate the atherosclerotic process.", 
    "283": "We have established a novel photochemical model of intimal thickening in the rat femoral artery. The endothelium was injured by the photochemical reaction between rose bengal and green light, which was followed by thrombotic occlusion, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) migration and proliferation. The neointima was formed by proliferated VSMC and the extracellular matrix, reaching to maximal thickness within 3 weeks after the endothelial injury. Using this model, we have investigated the effect of several anti-proliferative drugs, anti-allergic drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, prostaglandin E1, anti-thrombotics, or leukotrienes receptor antagonists, on intimal thickening. This model has two major advantages in comparison with other methods: one is that the media is free from mechanical stress, and the model is expected to represent pathological changes close to clinical atherosclerosis. Another advantage is that this method is also applicable to small animals such as mice, including transgenic mice. These advantages are very helpful for investigating the mechanism of atherogenesis.",

At follow-up group A improved exercise capacity from 4.7 to 5.6 METS (p = 0.01). Groups B (4.7 to 5.0 METS) and C (5.2 to 5.6 METS) had no significant improvement. The mean respiratory exchange ratio improved significantly in group A (1.14 to 1.20, p = 0.02), as did left ventricular ejection fraction (26% to 31%, p = 0.02).

In untreated pigs, the tissue Ang II concentration (per gram wet weight) in different parts of the heart was 5 times the concentration (per milliliter) in plasma, and the tissue Ang I concentration was 75% of the plasma Ang I concentration.

    "294": "Most of the cardiac Ang II appears to be produced at tissue sites by conversion of in situ-synthesized rather than blood-derived Ang I. Our study also indicates that under certain experimental conditions, the heart can maintain its Ang II production, whereas the production of circulating Ang II is effectively suppressed.", 
    "295": "Toborinone (OPC-18790), a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, enhances cardiac contractility and is an arterial dilator. However, its effects on the venous system have not yet been clearly defined. Because toborinone administration reduces left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, it is probably also a venodilator. Because of the known arterial effects and the hypothesized venous effects, we compared changes in systemic vascular conductance (the inverse of resistance) with changes in venous capacitance.", 
    "296": "In 15 anesthetized, splenectomized dogs (10 treatment, 5 control), pressures were measured in the right atrium, aorta, portal vein, and LV. A cuff constrictor was placed around the portal vein. Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution, and splanchnic vascular capacitance was measured by blood-pool scintigraphic methods. Data were collected at baseline, after induction of heart failure (microsphere embolization into the left coronary artery), and then after toborinone boluses of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/kg. Heart failure was associated with decreased capacitance and conductance (to 87+/-3% and 64+/-4% of baseline values, respectively, P<0.05). After administration of the lower doses of toborinone, capacitance increased more than conductance; however, the effects were more balanced at the higher doses. Compared with nitroglycerin, hydralazine, and enalaprilat (results of an earlier study) in the same model, toborinone increased capacitance to a degree similar to that with nitroglycerin, at higher doses increased conductance similarly to hydralazine, and increased both capacitance and conductance considerably more than did enalaprilat.",

The measurements were repeated for 25 patients after 12 months of treatment with lisinopril.

An insulin resistance index was estimated using the homeostasis model analysis of fasting insulin-glucose interactions. Levels of serum insulin-like growth factor I binding proteins 3 and 1, plasma insulin-like growth factor I, and insulin were determined by specific radioimmunoassays.",

With the upper 100% confidence limit of the normotensive population as the cutoff point, a subgroup of 12 hypertensives had an abnormally high insulin resistance index. Compared with patients with normal insulin resistance indexes, patients with greater than normal indexes were characterized by lower binding protein 1 levels, similar binding protein 3 levels, lower binding protein 1 : binding protein 3 ratio and similar insulin-like growth factor I levels. The serum binding protein 1 level and the binding protein 1 : binding protein 3 ratio were inversely correlated to the insulin resistance index for the whole group of hypertensives. After treatment with lisinopril hypertensive patients with higher than normal insulin resistance indexes at baseline exhibited normalization of this parameter and significant increases of binding protein 1 levels and binding protein 1 : binding protein 3 ratio, with no significant changes in insulin-like growth factor I levels. These parameters remained unchanged for the remaining patients.", 
    "302": "These results suggest that tissue availability of circulating insulin-like growth factor I is a determinant of insulin sensitivity in patients with essential hypertension. Whereas the patients with normal insulin sensitivity exhibit greater than normal tissue access of circulating insulin-like growth factor I, patients with insulin resistance present normal tissue access of the factor. Our findings suggest that the ability of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to restore insulin sensitivity in essential hypertensives may be related to their ability to facilitate the tissue availability of circulating insulin-like growth factor I.",

The present open-label study was undertaken to assess the long-term efficacy, tolerability, and safety of such combinations. Patients from the factorial study were eligible for the 1-year, open-label extension. Initially, all patients received enalapril 5 mg-felodipine ER 2.5 mg once daily; if SiDBP was not controlled (< 90 mm Hg) after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose was titrated upward at 2- to 4-week intervals to a maximum of enalapril 10 mg-felodipine ER 10 mg. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg was added to the regimen of patients whose hypertension was not controlled at the highest enalapril-felodipine ER dose. A total of 507 patients were enrolled, of whom 502 were assessable. At their last study visit, 391 (78%) of the assessable patients were receiving only an enalapril-felodipine ER combination. The enalapril-felodipine ER combinations resulted in mean trough SiDBPs of 85 to 89 mm Hg (decreases of 13 to 16 mm Hg from baseline) and SiSBPs of 137 to 140 mm Hg (decreases of 13 to 21 mm Hg). Overall, 407 (81%) of the 502 assessable patients achieved an SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or a reduction from baseline > or = 10 mm Hg (responders); such a response was recorded in 331 patients (66%) taking a combination of enalapril-felodipine ER alone and 76 patients (15%) taking the combination with the addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg. Blood pressure reductions were maintained throughout the treatment period. Drug-related adverse events were relatively infrequent, often transient, usually mild, and apparently not dose related. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events were edema/swelling, asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, cough, and headache. These results suggest that combination therapy with enalapril-felodipine ER is effective for long-term blood pressure reduction, has an excellent safety profile, and is generally well tolerated. Addition of low-dose HCTZ to the enalapril-felodipine ER combination appears to provide further blood pressure control without increasing drug-related adverse events.",

The efficacy of this compound was tested in a cell-free system using a 50-mer synaptobrevin peptide as substrate. The peptide, designated as [Pya88] S 39-88, had a fluorescent amino acid analog, L-pyrenylalanine (Pya), substituted for the normal Phe88 of synaptobrevin-2. Cleavage by BoNT light chain yielded fragments of 38 and 11 amino acids, respectively. The smaller fragment, containing the Pya fluorophore, was readily separated and quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy at 377 nm. In the presence of 7-200 microM ICD 1578, cleavage of [Pya88] S 39-88 was progressively reduced (IC50 = 27.6 microM), and 100 microM ICD 1578 produced >95% inhibition. For comparison, captopril, a well-known zinc metalloprotease inhibitor, generated less than 10% inhibition at a concentration of 5 mM.

    "336": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to reduce blood pressure and proteinuria in a variety of different glomerular diseases. Nonetheless, a marked interindividual difference in the efficacy of these agents exists. The activity of the ACE and therefore of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been shown to be under genetic influence. Patients with a deletion genotype at the intron 16 of the ACE gene have been shown to exhibit higher activity of plasmatic ACE when compared to patients with the insertion genotype. We therefore studied prospectively the hemodynamic and antiproteinuric effect of a 6-month therapy with enalapril in patients with biopsy-proven proteinuric glomerular diseases and the DD (n = 10) and ID/II (n = 26) genotype. Although patients with the DD genotype received a slightly higher dose of enalapril, blood pressure and proteinuria did not change significantly. However, both were significantly reduced in the II/ID group after 10 weeks and 6 months of therapy. Creatinine clearance decreased steadily in DD patients. In II/ID patients, creatinine clearance was reduced significantly after 10 weeks of therapy but increased again thereafter and the value at 6 months was again comparable to the one obtained in the DD patients. We conclude from our study that the ACE genotype influences the blood pressure-lowering and antiproteinuric effect of enalapril in patients with proteinuric glomerular disease.",

MC-induced hypertension is, in part, mediated by the brain. We have examined another aspect of central MC action, the induction of NaCl appetite in these strains, by using the more common Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar (WS) strains for comparison. In the first experiment, LE and SD rats were administered three treatments known to induce an appetite for NaCl solution in rats. Administration of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) increased the intake of 0.45 M NaCl in both strains, but the amounts consumed were about 2-fold greater in LE rats than in SD rats. Administration of captopril also increased NaCl intake, but there were no differences between LE and SD rats. NaCl depletion with furosemide induced NaCl appetite in both strains, but the amounts consumed were about 2-fold greater in LE rats than in SD rats. In the second experiment, adult male WF and WS rats were administered DOCA, enalapril, or furosemide and NaCl appetite was determined. Both strains showed comparable NaCl appetite during each of these treatments. However, during a 5-week regimen of DOCA with only NaCl-KCl solution to drink, uninephrectomized WF rats consumed less than WS rats. Thus, despite reported resistance to MC-induced hypertension, neither LE nor WF strains of rats showed correspondingly marked deficits in induced NaCl appetite.", 
    "338": "The present study was conducted to prospectively evaluate whether a new ACE inhibitor, temocapril, could modify urinary microalbumin excretion rate (UAE) in a group of hypertensive outpatients who had no evidence of renal impairment. Sixty-three outpatients (32 men and 31 women; mean age, 59.9 +/- 1.5 yr) with essential hypertension entered the study, all having been treated for at least 6 mo with dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCBs: nitrendipine, nisoldipine, or amlodipine). Their blood pressures (BPs) had been controlled to adequate levels with the CCBs. None had overt proteinuria (determined by Albustix) or abnormal serum creatinine levels. After 3 mo of baseline observation under the previous treatment, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In group A (n = 31), the previously used CCBs were switched to temocapril, 2 to 4 mg once daily for 12 mo, and BP was controlled at a level equivalent to that during CCB treatment. In group B (n = 32), the subjects were maintained on their previous treatment for a further 12 mo. The effect of temocapril on BP appeared to be clinically similar to that of the previously used CCBs, but it significantly decreased UAE as compared with the previous therapy. In group A, UAE decreased significantly (p < 0.01) from the baseline value of 38.9 +/- 5.1 mg/g creatinine (Cr) to 22.2 +/- 4.2 and 25.3 +/- 5.6 mg/g Cr at the 6th and 12th months of temocapril therapy, respectively. In contrast, in group B UAE was unchanged (baseline 39.8 +/- 6.6 mg/g Cr; 6 mo, 44.6 +/- 6.8; 12 mo, 45.9 +/- 7.7). In group A, 17 of 31 patients (54.8%) had abnormal UAE levels (> or = 29.5 mg/g Cr) during previous therapy with CCBs, but 6 mo after switching to temocapril 25 of these patients (80.6%) had normal UAE (< 29.5 mg/g Cr). In group B, 15 of 32 patients (46.9%) had abnormal UAE levels during the observation period, and these abnormal UAE levels remained unchanged; 17 of the 32 patients (53.1%) had abnormal UAE levels after a further 6 mo of continued CCBs therapy. We conclude that long-term therapy with temocapril may provide renal protection by reducing UAE even in hypertensive patients with no evidence of renal impairment.", 
    "339": "Antihypertensive therapy is indicated for reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that accompanies arterial hypertension. Usually, pharmacological treatment is started as monotherapy, which, if unsuccessful, is followed by sequential monotherapy, or by combination therapy. Recent data indicate that combination therapy is required in more than 50% of the hypertensive population when the goal is to reduce blood pressure to below 140/90 mm Hg. The choice and doses of drugs used in combination therapy should be such that their synergistic effect on blood pressure is maximized, the tolerability of the drugs is maintained and side-effects are minimized. The combination of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a beta-blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is one of the most commonly used combination therapies. Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies compared the antihypertensive effects of the dihydropyridine, barnidipine, with the beta-blocker, atenolol (n = 247), and the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (n = 155). The efficacy and tolerability of barnidipine in combination with either atenolol or enalapril was also investigated. Monotherapy with barnidipine was as effective in reducing blood pressure as monotherapy with either atenolol or enalapril. Combining barnidipine with either atenolol or enalapril reduced blood pressure further, and significantly increased the percentage of patients attaining the required reduction in blood pressure. When patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by enalapril monotherapy were switched to barnidipine monotherapy, the majority then achieved the desired reduction in blood pressure. These results indicate that if barnidipine monotherapy fails to lower blood pressure to the desired values, its combination with either a beta-blocker or an ACE inhibitor is effective and well tolerated.", 
    "340": "Differently from other vasodilators, the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors is not accompanied by an increase in resting heart rate which suggests a modulatory action of these drugs on arterial baroreflex control of heart rate. It is debated whether this modulation involve, an increase in gain (or sensitivity) of baroreflex mechanisms controlling heart rate or is due to a baroreflex control resetting. In this study we investigated the arterial baroreflex control of heart rate both in supine rest and during active standing before and after 7 and 30 days of treatment with a new ACE-inhibitor, trandolapril (2 mg per os oid) in 15 mild hypertensive patients. Baroreflex control of heart rate has been dynamically and non-invasively assessed by analysis of the continuous relationship between beat-to-beat spontaneous fluctuations in systolic blood pressure and pulse interval. By this method, sequences of 3 or more consecutive beats in which systolic blood pressure and pulse interval change in the same direction (either increasing or decreasing) are identified and a linear regression is applied to each individual sequence. The mean individual slope of the systolic blood pressure/pulse interval ratio obtained by averaging all slopes computed within a given period, is calculated and taken as an estimate of the spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity for that period. Trandolapril reduced resting blood pressure significantly (from 147.5 +/- 3.3/95.3 +/- 1.5 to 129.5 +/- 3.7/83.6 +/- 1.6 and 126.6 +/- 3.9/84.5 +/- 1.7 mmHg after 7 e 30 days, respectively) without affecting heart rate. The treatment did not alter baroreflex sensitivity but resulted in an apparent leftward shift of the regression line relating systolic blood pressure to pulse interval along the pressure axis, reflecting the lower prevailing level of arterial pressure. The increases in heart rate and blood pressure induced by standing in control conditions were not significantly modified by trandolapril. Baroreflex sensitivity was significantly reduced by standing both in control conditions and, to the same extent, during treatment. These results suggest that ACE-inhibition does not alter the gain of the integrated baroreflex mechanisms controlling heart rate, but results in a baroreflex resetting that may explain the lack of tachycardia normally observed during antihypertensive therapy with ACE-inhibitors.",

One patient developed fatal cardiogenic shock with raised PAWP (27 mm Hg) and RAP (11 mm Hg), and vasodilatation (SVRI = 1129 dyn.s.cm-5). Stroke volume (30.5 (8.7) ml/m2) and cardiac output (4.3 (1.5) 1/m2) improved with resolution of pulmonary oedema (PAWP = 14.4 (4.2) mm Hg) following afterload reduction with captopril.", 
    "351": "Mild envenomation causes severe vasoconstriction and hypertension. Severe envenomation produces predominant left ventricular dysfunction with normal systemic vascular resistance manifesting as pulmonary oedema or severe hypotension depending on the fluid balance. Shock due to biventricular dysfunction and vasodilatation occurs terminally.", 
    "352": "The role of genetic factors was reviewed with respect to the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma, sarcoidosis and cough induced by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administration. The so-called 'atopy gene' in 11q13 is not linked to atopy but is associated with serum IgE levels. The beta2-adrenergic receptor gene on 5q32-33 was found to have polymorphism by Ban I and to be related to beta2-receptor function; a defect of a 2.3 kb allele is related to lowered sensitivity to beta2-agonists. This defect is also related to higher prevalence on non-atopic bronchial asthma. The occurrence of amino acid mutation (Arg16 to Gly) of beta2-receptors was lower and Gln27 to Glu mutation is extremely rare in the Japanese population compared with Caucasians. There is polymorphism of ACE genotypes among normal subjects and patients with sarcoidosis, II, ID and DD. The genotype is a significant determinant of serum ACE activity and may determine the prognosis of sarcoid patients. Genotype II has a higher incidence of coughing induced by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "353": "Coughing is a frequent side-effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Its pathogenesis is thought to be related to the local accumulation of tachykinins although the role of extrinsic cholinergic pathways is unclear. The development of an ACE inhibitor induced cough in two patients who have undergone heart-lung transplantation and in whom cholinergic pathways remain denervated supports the hypothesis of a 'local' mechanism.", 
    "354": "Central sleep apnoea (CSA) in congestive heart failure is sleep state dependent and occurs typically in stages I and II of non-REM sleep. The pre-requisites are hypocapnia and some prolongation of the circulation time. It is not certain whether abnormalities in after-discharge activity in the brainstem are also important. The presence of CSA in patients with left ventricular dysfunction is a poor prognostic sign and associated with a higher mortality in that group compared to age, sex and ejection fraction matched patients with congestive cardiac failure alone. It is reasonable to speculate that the CSA causes an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity which would maintain afterload at a high level or tend to increase it with time. The application of a high afterload to an impaired left ventricle leads over time to a further reduction in ejection fraction. From other studies, particularly ACE inhibitor studies, it is known that ejection fraction and prognosis are almost linearly related. It could therefore be said that once CSA has developed it may lead to a vicious circle of increasing afterload and further reduction in ejection fraction, causing worsening CSA and further increases in afterload. A number of treatments have been shown to be of benefit: supplemental nocturnal oxygen therapy, acetazolamide and nasal CPAP therapy have all been shown to reduce CSA. In addition nasal continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) has been shown by two groups in Canada to also improve ejection fraction. The beneficial effects on ejection fraction in particular, persist after the treatment has been withdrawn, which suggests either remodelling of the left ventricular musculature or a resetting of the baseline sympathetic nervous system activity. The impressive increase in ejection fraction due to three months nasal CPAP therapy in one study (an average 35% increase) is both dramatic and exciting for the future. It is reasonable to expect improvement in prognosis for patients with CCF whose ejection fraction rises with CPAP treatment. Finally, only a limited number of studies have been published. Unfortunately the impressive results from Canada have not yet been reproduced in other centres around the world.", 
    "355": "The Canadian Heart Health Survey, in which all 10 Canadian provinces participated using a standardized protocol, provides data from 23,129 randomly selected participants. The hypertension component of this survey indicates a prevalence of 22%; among these hypertensives, 59% were aware of their elevated blood pressure status. The breakdown of aware hypertensives indicates that 16% of those were treated and controlled, 24% were treated but not controlled, and 19% were neither treated nor controlled. In terms of drug prescription pattern, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including angiotensin II antagonists, command the maximum market share of 27.7% ($36 million), followed by diuretics, calcium channel blockers, beta3-blockers, and others. Although hypertension awareness and control have improved in the past 25 years, sustained efforts are warranted to control hypertension in Canada.", 
    "356": "We investigated the ability of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril hydrochloride, and of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besilate, to prevent nephrosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in rats with hypertension induced by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO). Male Wistar rats were given distilled water (control), NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 500 mg/L, L-NAME plus imidapril 10 mg/L or 100 mg/L, or L-NAME plus amlodipine 50 mg/L or 100 mg/L in the drinking water (n = 10-12). We then collected 24-h urine samples at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, obtained blood samples at 6 weeks, and histologically examined the kidney and heart. L-NAME markedly reduced the levels of NO metabolites in serum and urine while increasing the tail-cuff blood pressure, the urinary albumin level (1.90 +/- 0.65 v 0.05 +/- 0.02 mg/day/100 g in control), and the area of the left ventricular wall (83.3 +/- 3.0 v 69.8 +/- 1.8 mm2 in control). Nephrosclerosis and myocardial interstitial fibrosis were documented histologically. The plasma renin activity was significantly higher in rats treated with L-NAME than in the control rats. The concomitant administration of imidapril (10 mg/L) with L-NAME completely normalized the tail-cuff pressure, the LVH (70.8 +/- 1.8 mm2), the albuminuria (0.05 +/- 0.01 mg/day/100 g), and the histologic changes. Amlodipine (50 mg/L) also ameliorated the L-NAME-induced effects, but to a lesser extent. Thus, the chronic inhibition of NO synthesis in rats produced nephrosclerosis and LVH that were effectively prevented by giving imidapril at a dose lower than that of amlodipine. We conclude that ACE inhibitors can prevent nephrosclerosis and LVH even in the presence of a reduction in NO production, implying that in rats the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is more effective than the blockade of calcium channels in preventing hypertensive tissue injury.", 
    "357": "We investigated the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic nervous system function and carotid arterial distensibility during treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (derapril) or a calcium channel blocker (manidipine) for hypertension. In 37 patients with hypertension, autonomic function was assessed by heart rate variability and baroreceptor sensitivity using phenylephrine injection. Left ventricular mass index and carotid arterial distensibility were assessed by ultrasound examinations. Before the medication, both baroreceptor sensitivity and heart rate variability correlated with carotid arterial distensibility, but not with left ventricular mass index by multiple regression analysis. Subsequently, patients were randomly allocated into two groups, derapril (n = 18) and manidipine (n = 19) for 20 weeks. At the end of the study, the change in baroreceptor sensitivity correlated with change in carotid arterial distensibility (r = 0.41, P < .05), but not with change in left ventricular mass index. Although derapril and manidipine decreased blood pressure and left ventricular mass index to the same extent, the former improved heart rate variability, baroreceptor sensitivity (5.0 +/- 1.9 --> 5.6 +/- 2.0 msec/mm Hg), and carotid arterial distensibility (2.1 +/- 0.8 --> 2.5 +/- 1.0 %kPa), but the latter did not improve them at all. Thus, impairment of the autonomic balance was related to the impairment of carotid arterial distensibility in hypertension; derapril, but not manidipine, significantly improved these abnormalities.", 
    "358": "Cardiovascular parasympathetic activity is attenuated in essential hypertension. Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been reported to increase vagal modulation of heart rate and baroreflex sensitivity, but the relations between the antihypertensive and vagal cardiac effects of these drugs have remained unclear in essential hypertension. In the present study we evaluated the effects of a 4-week crossover monotherapy with metoprolol and ramipril on spectrum analysis indices of heart rate variability in the supine rest and head-up tilted positions, baroreflex sensitivity (phenylephrine method), and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in 12 formerly untreated stage 1-2 essential hypertensive patients. Compared to the pretreatment values, both drugs decreased BP similarly and significantly. However, the drugs showed different effects on cardiac vagal activity: metoprolol increased significantly mean R-R interval, R-R interval total, and high-frequency variability at supine rest and baroreflex sensitivity, but ramipril did not significantly affect these variables. The metoprolol-induced decrease in ambulatory BP correlated with the prolongation of the R-R interval and the increase of high-frequency variability at supine rest. The present data show that 4-week treatment with metoprolol increases tonic and reflex vagal cardiac activity, whereas ramipril does not affect vagal cardiac control in essential hypertension. Increase in vagal activity may contribute to the BP-lowering effect of metoprolol in hypertensive patients.", 
    "359": "This study was designed to evaluate in 45 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) the effects of a 6-month course with one of three different antihypertensive regimens (the calcium channel blocker isradipine, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor spirapril in monotherapy, or a combination of the two drugs, n = 15 per group) on blood pressure, LVH regression, and various functional correlates of LVH. All three treatment modalities decreased significantly LV mass index by an average of 10%, although the combination had the greatest blood pressure-lowering effect and spirapril had the least, as assessed by office resting pressures, ambulatory monitoring, and isometric grip testing. There was no correlation between magnitude of blood pressure lowering and degree of LVH regression. The effects of treatment on pressor hormone profiles differed among groups, as spirapril tended to suppress angiotensin II and norepinephrine, whereas isradipine had opposite effects. Exercise tolerance was prolonged by all three regimens, but significantly more by the combination. All three regimens decreased significantly the double product by 10% to 15%. Indices of electrophysiologic stability calculated from analysis of ambulatory electrocardiogram exhibited significant improvement in several parameters such as QRS duration, presence of late potentials, and measures of heart rate variability, resulting in fewer episodes of simple or complex ventricular arrhythmia. We conclude that all three regimens produce significant LVH regression associated with improved functional capacity and electrical stability. These results reflect the sum of the differential hemodynamic and hormonal effects exerted by each treatment modality.", 
    "360": "Metaanalyses have indicated that ACE inhibitors are more effective than other first-line therapies in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The average treatment period, however, was only approximately 6 months. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to clarify the time course and degree of reversal, and primarily to find out in how many patients a complete normalization of LVH can be achieved. Secondly, we sought to determine whether atrial enlargement can be reduced. Previously untreated hypertensive patients (mean age 46.3 +/- 9 years, eight women, 15 men) with echocardiographically confirmed LVH (left ventricular mass index ([LVMI] > 125 g/m2 for men; > 110 g/m2 for women) were prospectively treated over a 3-year treatment period with quinapril. Nine patients received 10 mg quinapril, 12 received 20 mg of quinapril daily, and five patients additionally received 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. The time course of changes in LVMI, relative wall thickness, left atrial size, fractional shortening, and diastolic function was evaluated and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and an exercise test were performed every 6 months. After a mean treatment period of only 7.5 months, there was a significant (P < .001), 17.5% decrease in LVMI with a further continuous and significant (P < .001) decrease of 38.6% after 38.3 +/- 3 months of therapy. In 90.5% of the patients a complete reversal of LVH was achieved. Fractional shortening increased significantly, the maximum being 14.6% after 38.3 +/- 3 months. The peak early/atrial velocity (E/A) ratio increased significantly (P < .01) after just 7.5 +/- 3.1 months with no further changes during follow-up. There seemed to be a parallel change with the decrease in left atrial dimension, where the most important decrease occurred after only 7.5 +/- 3.1 months (P < .01), with a further continuous reduction. Our study clearly shows that maximum reversal of LVH is a time-consuming process and that an essential goal of antihypertensive therapy should be not only a reduction in LVH but also a normalization in LV mass, left atrial size, and in diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "361": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been associated with insulin resistance, a condition with an impaired insulin-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. ACE-inhibitors have been reported to be superior to most other antihypertensive drugs in inducing a regression of LVH. In a double-blind study with parallel groups, 50 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with either fosinopril (20 mg o.d.) or atenolol (50 mg o.d.) for 12-16 weeks. Left ventricle wall thickness (LVWT, defined as the sum of interventricular septum and posterior wall), diastolic function (represented by the ratio between the E-wave and the A-wave of mitral blood flow) and femoral artery blood flow (FBF) were evaluated using ultrasonic measurements. FBF was measured at normoinsulinemia and after 2 h of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Before treatment, the insulin-induced increase in FBF was inversely related to the LVWT (r = -0.52, p < 0.02). The reduction in ambulatory 24-h SBP/DBP was 13/9 mmHg for fosinopril and 15/14 for atenolol, ambulatory DBP being significantly more reduced by atenolol (p = 0.03 for difference in treatment effect). However, only fosinopril treatment resulted in a significant reduction in LVWT (from 20.5 mm to 19.4 mm, p < 0.05). The degree of reduction in LVWT was related to the increase in FBF in the fosinopril group (r = -0.45, p < 0.05). For fosinopril (but not for atenolol), there was a positive relationship between the change in E/A ratio and the change in femoral artery stroke volume (r = 0.80, p < 0.01).", 
    "362": "Impaired insulin-induced stimulation of leg blood flow was related to an increased LVWT. Furthermore, during fosinopril treatment, regression of LVWT was associated with enhanced skeletal muscle blood flow during hyperinsulinemia. This indicates that impaired peripheral blood flow (and thereby increased afterload) may be a possible mechanism explaining the previously found association between insulin resistance and cardiovascular hypertrophy.", 
    "363": "The aim of the study was to compare the effects of two long-acting antihypertensive agents, the calcium-antagonist amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, on left ventricular mass and diastolic filling in patients with mild to moderate diastolic hypertension from primary care centres. It is a 1-year prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, comparative study. Patients between 25 and 75 years of age with untreated hypertension with elevated diastolic blood pressure (> or = 95 mmHg) on three occasions (twice on the first visit and once only on the second and third visits) were recruited from a population survey. After 4 weeks placebo run-in 71 patients were randomized to dosages of amlodipine 5-10 mg or lisinopril 10-20 mg, which were titrated on the basis of the effects on blood pressure. Fifty-nine patients completed the study period. Primary endpoints were left ventricular mass index and early to atrial peak filling velocity. Office and ambulatory blood pressure and other echocardiographic measurements were considered secondary. Decrease in blood pressure was equal for both treatment regimens. A statistically significant decrease in left ventricular mass index in both treatment groups was observed: -11.0 g/m2 (95% CI: -6.0, -16.1) in the amlodipine group and -12.6 g/m2 (95% CI: -8.2, -17.0) in the lisinopril group. The higher the baseline value of left ventricular mass before treatment, the more the decrease after treatment. Early to atrial peak filling velocity did not change significantly within the treatment groups: +0.07 (95% CI: -0.01, +0.15) in the amlodipine group and +0.01 (95% CI: -0.06, +0.08) in the lisinopril group. However, analysis of time measurements of the early peak showed significant changes for both treatment groups. No significant differences in primary and secondary endpoints between treatment groups were found. Twelve patients did not complete the study, seven in amlodipine and five in lisinopril, basically due to adverse events. The effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and early to atrial filling peak velocity after 1 year of treatment in patients with previously untreated mild to moderate hypertension are similar. Further studies are recommended, particularly with a larger sample size and a follow-up of longer duration.", 
    "364": "The long-term administration of captopril to patients with a left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction reduces the rate of recurrent coronary thrombosis. Thus, in the present study we investigated the influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) on experimental venous thrombosis in normotensive rats and the involvement of NO and PGI2 in this effect. Animals were treated with captopril (1.5, 5 or 25 mg/kg twice daily, CAP), enalapril (15 mg/kg once daily, ENA) or distilled water for 10 days, per os. After ligation of the vena cava the thrombus weight decreased in both CAP and ENA treated rats. The effect was most pronounced in animals given the highest dose of CAP (p<0.0001 vs. control) and was significantly stronger than observed in ENA treated animals (CAP vs. ENA p<0.01). The mean blood pressure measured by the \"tail cuff\" method and platelet aggregation were not altered by either of the ACE-Is. The antithrombotic activity of CAP was reduced by indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and independently by the NO-synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (3 mg/kg i.v. bolus + 3 mg/kg/h i.v. infusion, L-NAME). In the latter case CAP regained its antithrombotic properties in rats pretreated with L-Arginine (300 mg/kg i.v. + 300 mg/kg/h i.v.) before administration of L-NAME (p<0.05 vs. control). Moreover, the concomitant administration of indomethacin and L-NAME failed to completely abolish the antithrombotic action of captopril. Similar effects were observed in respect to the incidence of venous thrombosis. Our study documents a novel and important effect of ACE-Is on the vein thrombotic process and demonstrates the involvement of NO and PGI2 in this phenomenon.",

It results in considerable morbidity, mortality, and expense. The average cost of managing one diabetic patient with ESRD is approximately $50,000 a year. Over the last decade, several advances in the management of diabetic nephropathy have allowed physicians to intervene and retard the progression of renal failure in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Stalling the progression of renal failure allows patients to maintain a superior quality of life and saves society millions of dollars that can be allocated to other aspects of health care. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to increase. With the continued advances in medical technology and care, persons with this disease will live longer, and the incidence of diabetic nephropathy will increase. Primary care physicians will have the most frequent contact with these patients and therefore will have the greatest potential to favorably affect their clinical course. This review focuses on the therapeutic interventions available to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Clinicians should strive to secure euglycemia and obtain optimal blood pressure control in their patients. The unique renal-protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will be reviewed, as will the salutary effects of a low-protein diet, normalizing serum cholesterol, and the cessation of smoking. The optimal timing of dialysis access placement and the initiation of dialysis and transplantation will also be discussed.", 
    "372": "In the era of managed health care, the primary physician will be required to play an active role in the management of patients with early renal failure. This section provides a comprehensive and practical approach to the management of such patients. Early recognition of renal failure and monitoring its progression require an understanding of the pitfalls of commonly used diagnostic tests. Tight control of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and dietary protein restriction play important roles in delaying the progression of renal disease. Avoidance of additional renal insults such as nephrotoxic drugs and radiographic contrast prevents acceleration of renal demise. A variety of clinical manifestations, including dyselectrolytemias, hypertension, malnutrition, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia may develop in patients with early renal failure. Timely referral to a nephrologist will facilitate planning for renal replacement therapy and may favorably affect eventual outcomes.", 
    "373": "Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) has been reported to induce relaxation which is partially blocked by a kinin receptor antagonist. We investigated the relationship between kinins and angiotensin peptides with use of preconstricted isolated pig coronary arteries. Ang 1-7 alone (up to 10(-5) M) had no relaxant effect. Bradykinin (BK) (10(-10)-10(-7) M) induced transient relaxation, returning to basal tone, although BK remained in the bath. In these BK-stimulated rings, Ang 1-7 but not BK (both 5 x 10(-6) M) again relaxed the rings by approximately 50%. This relaxation was blocked by a BK B2 antagonist, a kininase, and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Ang 1-7 inhibited purified angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by 30 +/- 3.5% (n = 4) at 10(-6) M. However, in BK-pretreated rings, the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat did not induce relaxation, nor did it affect the relaxant response to Ang 1-7, which suggests that the effect of Ang 1-7 was not caused by ACE inhibition. Ang 1-7-induced vasodilation was reduced by 69.9 +/- 6.2% by an AT2 receptor blocker, PD-123319, and 29.3 +/- 7.3% by an AT1 antagonist, losartan. Neither the nonselective AT1/AT2 receptor antagonist sarthran nor saralasin inhibited the response to Ang 1-7. Ang II did not elicit relaxation either alone or in the presence of losartan, which suggests that activation of AT2 receptors does not cause relaxation. Thus, in the presence of bradykinin, Ang 1-7 relaxes pig coronary arteries via a PD-123319-sensitive mechanism involving nitric oxide, kinins and the BK B2 receptor. The kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems may be linked through the interaction of Ang 1-7 and BK.", 
    "374": "The renin-angiotensin system is central to the pathophysiology of a number of cardiovascular disorders. Most obviously this is so with renin secreting tumours, but the system is of central importance in other disorders such as scleroderma renal crisis and most cases of malignant hypertension. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system in unilateral renal artery stenosis is pivotal to the development of hypertension and the disturbances in electrolyte and volume balance -- most particularly in the hyponatraemic-hypertensive syndrome. Likewise, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system is an important contributor, amongst many other systems, to the pathophysiology of cardiac failure. In diabetic nephropathy, the renin-angiotensin system is often suppressed as gauged by circulating levels of renin, yet it appears to make an important contribution to the progressive decline in renal function. Much less clear is the role of the renin-angiotensin system in essential hypertension insofar as it contributes to the level of blood pressure, to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, and in the evolution of complications such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has contributed to our understanding of the role of this system in cardiovascular disease. The advent of selective angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers will further increase knowledge in this area.", 
    "375": "The benefits of anti-hypertensive drug treatment have been established by clinical trials demonstrating significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thiazide diuretics predominated in these trials but it is reasonable to conclude that the benefits were attributable to the blood pressure (BP) reduction per se and not to specific pharmacological characteristics. Furthermore, it can be calculated that even greater benefits would probably have accrued if the magnitude of the BP reduction had been greater. On first principles, therefore, the basic requirement for any anti-hypertensive drug is confirmation of its ability to reduce BP. The angiotensin II antagonists constitute an important new class of drug, with a low incidence of adverse effects, but early studies with the prototype, losartan, have raised some doubts about its anti-hypertensive 'potency' in the clinical setting. For example, in several different comparative studies there were consistently lesser BP reductions with losartan compared to enalapril. This applied to both the trough and peak BP reductions. Furthermore, dose-response relationships have not always been clearly defined: for example, in one study diastolic BP reductions (trough) fell in the range 4.1 to 4.8 mm Hg with 50, 100 and 150 mg losartan. Although the preliminary results with newer angiotensin II antagonists suggest that they may have greater efficacy, there is only limited information about the definitive identification of the clinically relevant dose ranges for many of these drugs.", 
    "376": "Two problems in the treatment of hypertension continue to be largely unsolved. The first, and more simple, is our inability to adequately control blood pressure in the majority of hypertensive patients. This not only reflects the difficulty of retaining patients in effective treatment programs, but also of convincing physicians to strive for optimal blood pressure levels. There is a continuing need for new antihypertensive drugs and combinations to help accomplish these goals. The second major problem is that the major clinical endpoints, including coronary events and renal failure, have not been adequately reduced by traditional therapies. Standard regimens, particularly those including diuretics, have protected against strokes and heart failure. Our improved understanding of vascular biology in hypertension has directed interest to the mechanisms in hypertensive patients that might accelerate atherosclerosis and vascular events in these individuals. This involves addressing the concomitant metabolic risk factors that comprise the \"Hypertension Syndrome,\" and, perhaps of equal importance, finding therapies that directly inhibit unwanted types of growth and proliferative activities within the walls of critical arteries. Many substances within the endothelium and the vascular wall may participate as initiators or mediators of pathology, but most information thus far has focused on the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (and potentially angiotensin receptor blockers) have provided coronary and renal protection in various cardiovascular conditions, though not yet in formal hypertension trials. Calcium channel blockers have also shown promise, including recent stroke and cardiovascular benefits in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, but, again, definitive coronary data in hypertension are awaited. Unless concomitant conditions mandate the selection of a particular antihypertensive drug class, physicians currently have a dilemma: should they choose drugs from older classes that have not provided full protection? Or, should they prescribe newer agents with exciting potential but with, as yet, unproved endpoint benefits in hypertension? Until currently ongoing prospective trials of antihypertensive therapy are completed, physicians must be guided by their own interpretations of the available data.", 
    "377": "Only approximately 40% to 50% of hypertensive patients will achieve goal blood pressures of <140/ 90 mm Hg with monotherapy, regardless of the medication used. Fixed-dose combination therapy with two different classes of antihypertensive agents will achieve goal pressures in more than 70%. The sixth Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure has suggested that the use of combination therapy is appropriate as initial treatment. The advantages of combinations include: 1) greater blood pressure decrease and response rates than monotherapy; 2) fewer side effects with small doses of two drugs than with large doses of one agent; 3) improved adherence to treatment; and 4) possibly lower cost of therapy. Many different combinations of diuretics and beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, as well as ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are available. Two of these, Ziac and Capozide, have been approved as initial therapy. It is possible that the number of hypertensive individuals controlled at goal blood pressure levels will be increased if combination therapy is used as initial treatment.",

Dr. Michael Weber of New York will discuss some newer data on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers and attempt to answer the question: are these data sufficient to warrant recommending these agents as initial therapy?

In rabbit aorta with intact endothelium and precontracted with phenylephrine, captopril and superoxide dismutase (SOD) produced dose-dependent relaxation. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor without a -SH group in its structure, did not produce endothelium-dependent relaxation. It was observed that captopril, like SOD, produced the relaxation by protecting the EDRF from getting inactivated by superoxide anions as pyrogallol and methylene blue inhibited both the captopril and SOD-mediated relaxation. The free radical scavenging action of captopril is further substantiated by the observation that captopril, but not lisinopril, inhibited FeCl3/ascorbic acid-induced lipid peroxidation in whole tissue homogenates of rabbit aorta to a level comparable to that of SOD. These results suggest that endothelium-dependent vasodilation produced by captopril may be due to its ability to scavenge superoxide anion and this property may be ascribed to the -SH group present in its structure.", 
    "380": "A 47-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of general fatigue and dyspnea. She had been diagnosed with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) when she was 39 years of age, on the basis of Raynaud's phenomenon, proximal sclerosis, and pigmentation of the skin. On admission, her blood pressure was 206/128 mmHg. Funduscopy revealed grade III (Keith & Wagener) hypertensive retinopathy. Laboratory data showed positivity for anti-nuclear antibody and anticardiolipin beta 2 glycoprotein I antibody, and the plasma level of renin activity (PRA) was abnormally high. Chest X-ray and UCG revealed massive pericardial effusion. On the second hospital day, she was operated on for pericardiodiaphragmatic fenestration. The volume of pericardial effusion amounted to more than 2000 ml. Post operative malignant hypertension persisted. Laboratory data showed thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure. We diagnosed scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. Following the initiation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) combined with calcium antagonist and alpha-one blocker, her blood pressure and PRA decreased. She also had been treated with aspirin 81 mg daily. These therapies were effective in recovering the platelet count and stopped the progression of anemia and renal failure. Although either the finding of large pericardial effusion or SRC is associated with poor prognosis in PSS, this case has had a good clinical course. In this case, the findings suggested that anti-phospholipid antibody may have contributed to the pericarditis and SRC.", 
    "381": "We report a 50-year-old male patient with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated membranous glomerulonephritis (MN), for which he had been treated with corticosteroid therapy for one and a half years. This patient received blood infusion at 38 years of age. He visited our hospital because of liver dysfunction at 42 years. One year later, proteinuria and microhematuria were pointed out (43 years). Renal biopsy revealed MN with focal fibrocellular crescents. HBsAg, cryoglobulin, rheumatoid factor were all negative. Prednisolone was administered at the dose of 30 mg/day for 4 weeks and tapered subsequently. The steroid treatment was effective (urinary protein excretion: 4.2-->0.3 g/day, serum albumin: 2.4-->4.0 g/dl, 3 months later), and transaminase slightly elevated (GPT 50-->60-80 IU/l). One and a half years later he proved to be positive for HCV antibody, and corticosteroid administration was terminated. Subsequently proteinuria increased, and reached 3.0 g/day 6 years later. However, serological markers and ultrasonographic study for chronic hepatitis revealed mild changes of the liver. These findings suggest that corticosteroid therapy is not contraindicated against HCV-associated MN, and may possibly be used as the treatment for this condition.", 
    "382": "Heart failure is defined as a malfunction of the cardiac muscle. The ongoing interaction between pump failure and the vasculature, however, results in symptoms due to malperfusion of the pulmonary and systemic circuit. As a consequence, biologic systems of pressure and volume control are activated. In the neurohumoral heart failure model the sympathetic nervous system, the renin system and endothelin all develop their own pathologic contribution to the disease process. Thereby the role of endothelin seems to be special since its production is particularly increased in advanced disease. Like angiotensin, endothelin has major proliferative properties to promote adverse vascular and myocardial growth. The finding of increasing neurohumoral activation as heart failure progresses and the role of plasma levels of neurohormones as predictors of mortality has rearranged the primary goal of therapy to suppress these deleterious neurohumoral systems as completely as possible. Though angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are currently first line therapy of heart failure, uncertainties remain concerning their mechanisms of action and - associated to that - optimal dosing.", 
    "383": "The acute diuretic and natriuretic effects of fasidotrilat, a mixed inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) were evaluated in control and myocardial-infarcted rats. Fasidotrilat injection (10 mg/kg i.v.) had no significant effect on arterial blood pressure and led to significant elevations in urine volume (+57% in control rats and +114% in infarcted rats) and of urinary sodium excretion (+81% in control rats and +225% in infarcted rats). Comparison between control and infarcted rats showed that fasidotrilat-induced changes in diuresis and natriuresis were higher in infarcted rats (2.4-fold for diuresis and 4.7-fold for natriuresis, p < 0.05), despite a lower perfusion pressure (-10 mm Hg) in infarcted rats. These data show the potential therapeutic interest of mixed NEP/ACE inhibitors in congestive heart failure.", 
    "384": "Suppression of formation of angiotensin II (A-II) is thought to be a major contributor to the hemodynamic response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-in) therapy. However, angiotensin II (A-II) plasma levels may rebound during ACE-in treatment. The study sought to verify the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of the combination of captopril (75 mg/d) plus losartan (25 mg/d). We also wished to establish whether the combination was able to avoid the increase of angiotensin II resulting from losartan treatment in early postinfarction phases of reperfused anterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Forty-four patients, hospitalized for suspected anterior AMI within 4 hours from the onset of symptoms, suitable for thrombolysis (first episode), Killip class I-II and reperfused, receiving 75 mg/d of captopril within 3 days from admission, and with systolic blood pressure (BP) >120 mmHg were randomized (single-blind) into two groups: Group A included 22 patients (6 women and 16 men) and received captopril 75 mg/d and placebo. Group B included 22 patients (5 women and 17 men) and received captopril 75 mg/d within 3 days from admission plus losartan 12.5 mg, as the first dose, and 25 mg/d (BP >110 mmHg) successively. Norepinephrine (NE) and A-II levels were measured on the 3rd and 10th days after admission. The two groups were similar with regard to age, sex, creatinine kinase peak, ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and risk factors. Group B (captopril plus losartan) showed a significant reduction of BP, from 124 +/- 8.5 mmHg to 108 +/- 6.4 mmHg, P < 0.001, at 10 days after admission. In group A, BP was 122 +/- 9 mmHg, and 10 days after admission BP was 118 +/- 11 mmHg. NE and A-II values did not show significant differences in basal samples. At 10 days after admission values were NE 298 +/- 90 versus 272 +/- 86 pg/mL and A-II 6.07 +/- 2.97 versus 5.29 +/- 2.05 pg/mL for the two groups. Our data suggest, for the first time, that the combination of captopril plus losartan is feasible and does not produce serious side effects. When losartan was added to ACE-in treatment, there was no significant increase in A-II.", 
    "385": "The modulatory effect of bradykinin on electrically-induced noradrenaline release was assessed in isolated atria from normal and B2 knockout transgenic mice preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline. Concentrations of 1, 3 and 10 nM of bradykinin did not significantly alter the outflow of radioactivity whereas higher concentrations of bradykinin (30 and 100 nM) enhanced it. The facilitatory effect of 30 nM bradykinin was inhibited by a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]bradykinin, 30 nM), and by a protein kinase C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (1 microM). The co-administration of bradykinin (1 to 100 nM) with either [Leu8]des-Arg9-bradykinin (100 nM), AcLys[DbetaNal7,Ile8]des-Arg9-bradykinin (30 nM) (bradykinin B1 receptor antagonists) or diclofenac (1 microM) (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), shifted the facilitatory effect of bradykinin to lower concentrations. The facilitatory effect of bradykinin also was enhanced by enalaprilat (1 microM) and mergetpa (1 microM), inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II) and kininase I, respectively. In contrast, selective bradykinin B1 receptor agonists, des-Arg9-bradykinin (1 to 100 nM) and Sar[D-Phe8]des-Arg7-bradykinin (1 to 100 nM), did not significantly affect the stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity. Neither bradykinin (100 nM) nor des-Arg9-bradykinin (100 nM) had any modulatory effect in B2 knockout transgenic mice. These findings suggest that the facilitatory effect of bradykinin on noradrenaline release in the mouse atria is mediated exclusively by presynaptic bradykinin B2 receptors which are linked to protein kinase C. The greater release of noradrenaline with bradykinin under inhibition of prostaglandins production and kininases I and II activity might be of importance in pharmacotherapies.", 
    "386": "Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are beneficial for patients with congestive heart failure, the appropriate timing and dosage in acute myocardial infarction are still controversial. We examined the hemodynamic effects of quinapril administered before acute myocardial infarction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Quinapril (10 mg/kg per day in drinking water) was started 1 week before infarction and continued for 4 weeks after infarction (total duration 5 weeks). The hemodynamic parameters were evaluated by cardiac catheterization 4 weeks after coronary ligation. Sham-operated SHR served as controls. After infarction, left ventricular end-diastolic and right atrial pressures were increased (P < 0.01) and blood pressure and cardiac index were decreased (P < 0.01); the magnitude of blood pressure reduction was similar in the treated and untreated rats with infarction. Quinapril improved these hemodynamic parameters significantly and decreased left and right ventricular weight. These results suggest that a prior treatment with quinapril in SHR with acute myocardial infarction is hemodynamically beneficial.", 
    "387": "This study shows the development of two major deformities in the non-stenosed kidney of the 2K-1C Goldblatt model; namely the widening of the LIS and the enlargement of the basilar interdigitations of the proximal tubule cells. These deformities were much less in the 2K-1C animals treated with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (AICEI) cilazapril. From these findings it is suggested that the non-stenosed kidney is operating under the diuretic effect of the elevated systemic blood pressure (SBP) via an increase in the renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP). Therefore, the AII antidiuretic effect is masked by the diuretic effect of the elevated SBP. The suggested rise in urine output fits well with the idea that kidneys lose water and sodium when SBP increases enormously. Therefore, in this model of hypertension, the non-stenosed kidney tries to lower SBP by losing water and sodium, an excretion behavior which is opposite to that of the stenosed kidney. Thus, the rise in SBP in this model is probably due to an increase in the vascular peripheral resistance rather than fluid accumulation.", 
    "388": "The sympathetic nervous system, coronary artery disease and myocardial ischaemia are related in different ways. First, the sympathetic system may be involved in the process of atherosclerosis through platelet activation and subsequent platelet-derived growth factor formation and by inducing mechanical injury to the vascular wall as a result of increased blood pressure and increased flow velocity. Secondly, sympathetic control of coronary vasomotor tone, which under normal conditions is not important, becomes functionally significant once coronary artery disease endothelial dysfunction has occurred. Under these circumstances, increased sympathetic adrenergic tone may lead to coronary vasoconstriction and, as myocardial oxygen demand increases concomitantly, myocardial ischaemia may ensue. Alternatively, myocardial ischaemia activates several neurohormonal systems, such as the sympathetic and, during more severe ischaemia, the circulating renin-angiotensin system. This leads to systemic and, possibly, coronary vasoconstriction and thus to further myocardial ischaemia. Prolonged myocardial ischaemia results in progressive norepinephrine release from the heart, reaching extracellular levels as high as 100-1000 x plasma concentrations. As cardiac beta-receptor density rises simultaneously, sympathetically-induced irreversible myocardial damage may occur, although through concomitantly increased beta-receptor kinase activity the beta-receptor may become functionally inactive. To counteract the detrimental effects of enhanced sympathetic activation on the heart, beta-blockade appears to be the proper choice. However, acute beta-blockade may lead to more profound ischaemia-induced neurohormonal activation and hence to vascular constriction through unoccupied alpha-receptors. In contrast, under ischaemic conditions and with concomitant beta-blockade, acute alpha-blockade does improve subendocardial flow and reduces myocardial ischaemia. A novel approach to anti-ischaemic therapy, which relates to modulating ischaemia-induced sympathetic activation, is through ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors affect myocardial ischaemia by reducing neurohormonal activation and related systemic and coronary vasoconstriction. These acute effects may become more important over time, as coronary endothelial function improves following long-term ACE inhibition. A large multicentre controlled trial comparing ACE inhibition with placebo in patients with coronary artery disease, the EUROPA (EUopean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease), which is currently underway, addresses the issue of whether ACE inhibition does in fact offer a novel approach in myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "389": "Neurohormonal activation is well studied in chronic heart failure, and covers aspects such as abnormalities of plasma catecholamines, particularly since plasma noradrenaline levels have been found to predict impaired prognosis in heart failure patients. This review will concentrate on the information available on circulating levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. It will discuss how catecholamine levels change during different disease stages from myocardial infarction to severe chronic heart failure. It has been clearly shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert particularly beneficial effects in heart failure patients with raised catecholamine levels. Nevertheless, reviewing how a variety of drug and non-drug interventions affect catecholamine levels and patients' survival, it is concluded that the effect on catecholamine levels does not directly correlate with a survival benefit of the respective intervention. Despite their prognostic significance, due to the development of new prognostic markers for patients with chronic heart failure, the overall clinical value of spot catecholamine levels remains limited.", 
    "390": "The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac performance and peripheral circulation. Changes in SNS activity measured as catecholamines in plasma or organ spillover have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Recent studies using microneurography to directly assess peripheral sympathetic nerve activity have demonstrated an increase in sympathetic activity in patients with borderline hypertension at rest and during hypoxia. We have recently shown that resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity is comparable in offspring of hypertensive and normotensive parents. However, during mental arithmetic the increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure was significantly more pronounced in offspring of hypertensive than in offspring of normotensive parents, but resting blood pressure was in the normotensive range and comparable in both groups. These data indicate that the response to mental stress results in a more pronounced activation of SNS in normotensive subjects with a genetic background of hypertension. In other cardiovascular disease states such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure activity of the SNS may determine prognosis significantly. Some calcium antagonists which are successfully used to treat patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris may have unfavourable effects in patients with impaired left ventricular function. This could be due in part to baroreceptor-mediated activation of the SNS, an effect which seems to be related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. In contrast, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors seem to directly decrease sympathetic nerve activity. This may explain at least in part their beneficial effects in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Thus, the SNS as a regulator of the cardiovascular system also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Furthermore, drug therapy could have a significant impact on the activity of the SNS.", 
    "391": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have earned an important place in medical therapy since their discovery about two decades ago. This family of drug has grown tremendously since the introduction of captopril in 1981. There are currently more than 14 ACE inhibitors in the world and 9 are available in the United States. Although these agents share many similarities, they differ in their pharmacokinetic properties, approved indications, and cost. This paper provides guidance for selection of ACE inhibitors by examining the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, adverse effects, and cost of these agents. Combination products of ACE inhibitors with either diuretics or calcium channel blockers also are reviewed.", 
    "392": "Chronic renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, evolve to terminal renal failure by a process leading to progressive parenchimal damage which appears relatively independent of the initial insult. When glomerular permselectivity is lost, proteins filtered through the glomerular capillary, through proximal tubular cell activation and up-regulation of genes of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators, may give rise to an inflammatory reaction that in the long-term can contribute to renal scarring. If this interpretation is correct, the best approach to try to retard the progression of several renal diseases would be to limit the excessive traffic of macromolecules throughout the glomerular capillary by molecules, as the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, that may help restore perm-selective properties to normal. Thus, the present review addresses the mechanism(s) of the renal protective effect of ACE inhibitors and analyzes the evidence so far available of their salutary effect in human nephropathies, with particular focus on diabetic nephropathy. The issue of whether ACE inhibitors alone or in combination with other antihypertensives (namely non-dihydropyridinic calcium channel blockers) may even prevent the onset of nephropathy at the stage of normoalbuminuria is discussed.", 
    "393": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a complex phenotype caused by interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors. A genetic susceptibility to MI was observed in a familial aggregation and studies in twins. Advances in molecular genetics have led to identification of a number of potential genetic risk factors for MI, such as variants of genes involved in vascular homeostasis, thrombosis, and lipid metabolism. Functional variants of angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE), beta-fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, glycoprotein Illa, and many apolipoprotein genes are considered excellent candidate risk factors for MI. Interaction of the susceptibility genes with modifier genes, environmental factors, and conventional risk factors results in the final phenotype of MI. Understanding the complex interaction between these factors is expected to provide significant insights into the pathogenesis of MI and lead to development of genetic-based risk stratification, prevention, and treatment.", 
    "394": "Ventricular remodeling refers to changes in left ventricular (LV) geometry, mass, and volume in response to myocardial injury or alterations in load. The extent of LV dilatation or remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) or in patients with heart failure is a strong predictor of both morbidity and mortality. Based on these observations, it is clear that LV remodeling is a maladaptive process. Two classes of drugs appear to inhibit LV remodeling. A large amount of data support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve survival and to prevent progressive remodeling. In addition, recent studies suggest that beta-adrenergic blockers have a beneficial effect on both survival and remodeling. These data support a causative role of the renin-angiotensin system and perhaps the sympathetic nervous system in this process. Thus, ACE inhibitors and possibly beta-blockers should be part of the pharmacologic regimen for the treatment of patients with LV dysfunction to prevent progressive LV remodeling.", 
    "395": "The aims of this study were to examine (1) the cardiac response to exercise in essential hypertension and (2) the effect of long-term enalapril treatment on cardiac reserve. Ten normotensive control subjects and 15 patients with moderate, essential hypertension underwent radionuclide ventriculography during graded, supine exercise (0 W-50 W-100 W). The hypertensive patients were studied during monotherapy using hydrochlorothiazide and 3 and 12 months after supplementation with enalapril 10-40 mg o.d. During exercise, the control subjects demonstrated a 17% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) mediated by a 30% decrease in end-systolic volume, a small increase in stroke volume and a minor biphasic (increase-decrease) change in end-diastolic volume. In the hypertensive patients, both the end-diastolic and the end-systolic volume increased substantially with no increase in LVEF, although stroke volume increased by 33%. Long-term therapy with enalapril induced only a minor change towards a more normal pattern of cardiac response to exercise. The hypertensive patients increased their stroke volume during exercise by recruiting preload reserve instead of increasing contractility. Long-term treatment with enalapril had little, if any, effect on this abnormal cardiac response.", 
    "396": "Patients with diabetic nephropathy experience a progressive and usually inexorable decline in renal function. The presence of the structurally defined advanced glycation end product (AGE) pentosidine on tissue and circulating proteins has been correlated with the severity of diabetic complications.", 
    "397": "To delineate a role for this AGE in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, glycohemoglobin and free and protein-bound pentosidine were measured in baseline stored serum and urine from a subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus and proteinuria originally followed by the Collaborative Study Group Trial. To delineate a potential role for an immune-activation response to AGEs, the inflammatory markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the monocyte activation marker marker neopterin were also measured at baseline.

At baseline the \"doublers\" as compared to the \"non-doublers\" had elevated serum levels of free pentosidine and neopterin. Baseline increases in these two parameters were also associated with an increased rate of \"doubling\" of serum creatinine by the proportional hazards method.",

    "400": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is a well established experimental model of renal injury leading to interstitial fibrosis. The molecular and cellular mechanism(s) of interstitial fibrosis in UUO are beginning to be elucidated. In the progression of interstitial fibrosis in UUO, up-regulation of collagen synthesis is commonly observed. HSP47 is a collagen-binding stress protein and is thought to be a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, which plays a pivotal role during the biosynthesis and secretion of collagen molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum. The synthesis of HSP47 has been demonstrated to always parallel that of collagen in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. It is well recognized that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is enhanced in the setting of UUO and that enhanced RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis in the obstructed kidneys.", 
    "401": "To investigate the role of HSP47 in the progression of interstitial fibrosis in mouse UUO, the expression of HSP47 was examined by Northern blotting, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in the obstructed kidneys. To test the possible involvement of enhanced RAS on the HSP47 expression, we examined the effects of lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on interstitial fibrosis. HSP47 and type I collagen mRNA expression.", 
    "402": "By Northern blot analysis, HSP47 mRNA was significantly up-regulated at 12 hours (about twice that of sham operated kidneys) after the onset of ureteral obstruction, further increased and stayed at the increased level until seven days (about 8 times that of sham operated kidneys). HSP47 mRNA and protein expression were observed in the periglomerular and peritubular interstitial regions of the obstructed kidneys. Distribution of smooth muscle alpha actin and type I collagen immunoreactivity were similar to the HSP47 distribution pattern, suggesting that HSP47 was up-regulated in the myofibroblasts. Lisinopril ameliorated the expansion of cortical interstitium in the obstructed kidneys at four and seven days after ureteral obstruction. HSP47 mRNA expression was suppressed at four and seven days, whereas type I collagen mRNA was suppressed only at seven days after the onset of ureteral obstruction.", 
    "403": "These results demonstrate the early and persistent up-regulation of HSP47 during the progression of interstitial fibrosis in mouse UUO kidneys, and further suggest the potential role of HSP47 in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis in the obstructed kidneys. Partial suppression of HSP47 mRNA expression by lisinopril at day 4 and day 7 after ureteral obstruction suggests that there are other immediate trigger(s) that induce the HSP47 mRNA expression. Identification of the molecular mechanism of HSP47 induction during UUO may give an insight into the novel aspects of the molecular pathophysiology of interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy.", 
    "404": "The effect of enalapril (5-10 mg/day) on the progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) was compared with that of metoprolol (40-120 mg/day) in 28 patients for 24 months in a prospective study. Throughout the study, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in protein intake and urinary sodium excretion. But there was a significant difference between the 2 groups in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure at 6 months. In the serum creatinine level, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. In creatinine clearance, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 24 months. In addition, the progression of CRF was significantly faster in the metoprolol group than the enalapril group as estimated from the slope of creatinine clearance (p < 0.05) and the slope of glomerular filtration rate (p < 0.0005). In urinary protein excretion, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 6 and 18 months (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that enalapril has a suppressive effect on the progression of CRF and also has an antiproteinuric effect by a mechanism independent of its antihypertensive effect.", 
    "405": "Microalbuminuria is a significant risk factor associated with nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease; however, there are no previous reports on the relationship of microalbuminuria with diabetic foot ulcers or stroke, despite the fact that microalbuminuria is a marker of vascular damage. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of microalbuminuria with diabetic foot ulcers in type II diabetes patients. In this, cross-sectional clinical study, outpatients of the offices at first level medical care in Durango, Mexico, were included in one of two groups; (a) patients with diabetic foot ulcers and (b) control of group patients without diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic foot diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical criteria and pletismography. Patients diagnosed with renal disease, urinary tract infection, acute febrile illness, or heart failure and those receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were excluded from the study. Microalbuminuria was measured, on a 24-h urine collection, by precipitation with sulfasalicylic acid, and turbidity was determined by measuring absorbance with a spectrophotometer. The study included 670 diabetic patients. Using both odds ratio and logistic regression analyses, diabetes duration, cigarette smoking, aging, and microalbuminuria showed a strong relationship with diabetic foot ulcers. Microalbuminuria should be considered as an independent risk factor for diabetic foot ulcers.", 
    "406": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce macrophage infiltration in several models of renal injury. We approached the hypothesis that angiotensin II (AngII) could be involved in inflammatory cell recruitment during renal damage through the synthesis of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In a model of immune complex nephritis, we observed an up-regulation of renal MCP-1 (mRNA and protein) coincidentally with mononuclear cell infiltration that were markedly reduced by treatment with the ACE inhibitor quinapril. Exposure of cultured rat mesangial cells to AngII increased MCP-1 mRNA expression (2.7-fold) and synthesis (3-fold), similar to that observed with TNF-alpha. Since NF-kappaB is involved in the regulation of MCP-1 gene, we explored whether the effects of AngII were mediated through NF-kappaB activation. Untreated nephritic rats showed increased renal NF-kappaB activity (3.5-fold) that decreased in response to ACE inhibition. In mesangial cells, AngII activated NF-kappaB (4.3-fold), and the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate abolished the AngII-induced NF-kappaB activation and MCP-1 gene expression. Our results suggest that AngII could participate in the recruitment of mononuclear cells through NF-kappaB activation and MCP-1 expression by renal cells. This could be a novel mechanism that might further explain the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in progressive renal diseases.", 
    "407": "Understanding the mechanism of action and the pharmacokinetic properties of vasodilatory drugs facilitates optimal use in clinical practice. It should be kept in mind that a drug belongs to a class but is a distinct entity, sometimes derived from a prototype to achieve a specific effect. The most common pharmacokinetic drug improvement is the development of a drug with a half-life sufficiently long to allow an adequate once-daily dosage. Developing a controlled release preparation can increase the apparent half-life of a drug. Altering the molecular structure may also increase the half-life of a prototype drug. Another desirable improvement is increasing the specificity of a drug, which may result in fewer adverse effects, or more efficacy at the target site. This is especially important for vasodilatory drugs which may be administered over decades for the treatment of hypertension, which usually does not interfere with subjective well-being. Compliance is greatly increased with once-daily dosing. Vasodilatory agents cause relaxation by either a decrease in cytoplasmic calcium, an increase in nitric oxide (NO) or by inhibiting myosin light chain kinase. They are divided into 9 classes: calcium antagonists, potassium channel openers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, alpha-adrenergic and imidazole receptor antagonists, beta 1-adrenergic agonist, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, eicosanoids and NO donors. Despite chemical differences, the pharmacokinetic properties of calcium antagonists are similar. Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is high, with all substances undergoing considerable first-pass metabolism by the liver, resulting in low bioavailability and pronounced individual variation in pharmacokinetics. Renal impairment has little effect on pharmacokinetics since renal elimination of these agents is minimal. Except for the newer drugs of the dihydropyridine type, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, nilvadipine, nisoldipine and nitrendipine, the half-life of calcium antagonists is short. Maintaining an effective drug concentration for the remainder of these agents requires multiple daily dosing, in some cases even with controlled release formulations. However, a coat-core preparation of nifedipine has been developed to allow once-daily administration. Adverse effects are directly correlated to the potency of the individual calcium antagonists. Treatment with the potassium channel opener minoxidil is reserved for patients with moderately severe to severe hypertension which is refractory to other treatment. Diazoxide and hydralazine are chiefly used to treat severe hypertensive emergencies, primary pulmonary and malignant hypertension and in severe preeclampsia. ACE inhibitors prevent conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and are most effective when renin production is increased. Since ACE is identical to kininase-II, which inactivates the potent endogenous vasodilator bradykinin, ACE inhibition causes a reduction in bradykinin degradation. ACE inhibitors exert cardioprotective and cardioreparative effects by preventing and reversing cardiac fibrosis and ventricular hypertrophy in animal models. The predominant elimination pathway of most ACE inhibitors is via renal excretion. Therefore, renal impairment is associated with reduced elimination and a dosage reduction of 25 to 50% is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Separating angiotensin-II inhibition from bradykinin potentiation has been the goal in developing angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. The incidence of adverse effects of such an agent, losartan, is comparable to that encountered with placebo treatment, and the troublesome cough associated with ACE inhibitors is absent.",

Although phlebotomy has previously been the treatment for PTP, drugs such as adenosine receptor antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be used to control PTP.", 
    "409": "The authors performed a prospective study of two different drugs to treat PTP: aminophylline and enalapril. Twenty-seven patients with PTP lasting more than 6 months were evaluated. During phase 1, aminophylline was compared with enalapril. The patients sequentially received aminophylline and enalapril during 12-week periods, intercalated by 12-week periods of no drugs. During phase 2, enalapril was administered for 12 weeks.", 
    "410": "From January 1984 to December 1993, 110 of 333 patients with PTP lasting more than 6 months (33%) developed polycythemia, and 27 patients were included in the present study. In phase 1, aminophylline had no effect on PTP. Enalapril promoted an erythropoiesis inhibition, characterized by a decrease in hematocrit and an increase in iron stores and ferritin levels. After withdrawal of enalapril, the hematocrit increased and the iron stores decreased. In phase 2, there was a progressive reduction in hematocrit after the 4th week of therapy. The lowest hematocrit was observed in the 12th week and then enalapril was stopped, leading to a subsequent rise in hematocrit. Erythropoietin levels and renal function remained constant during all periods of both phases of the study.", 
    "411": "The use of adenosine antagonists was ineffective to treat PTP in our series. However, treatment with enalapril promoted an erythropoiesis inhibition, demonstrated by a reduction in hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and reticulocyte count, associated with an increase in iron stores. This response occurred independently from erythropoietin levels or hemodynamic graft changes.", 
    "412": "Radionuclide tracing was performed to study renal function before and after hypotensive therapy in 95 patients suffering from nephrogenic hypertension with renal failure. It is shown that if hypotensive therapy in such patients brings about a blood pressure fall more than 25% of the initial blood pressure, renal function declines, the suppression being especially evident in severe renal insufficiency.", 
    "413": "In the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS II), in which enalapril treatment was initiated intravenously within 24 h after acute myocardial infarction, there was a neutral effect on 6-month mortality, whereas a beneficial effect on the progression of congestive heart failure was noted. We studied the effect of enalapril on left ventricular systolic function in terms of cardiac output and mean acceleration time measured by pulsed-wave Doppler in the left ventricular outflow tract and peripheral resistance. Early angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after acute myocardial infarction did not result in a general improvement of cardiac output. However, a small increase in cardiac output was observed in a subgroup of enalapril-treated patients with ejection fraction > or = 45%, probably due to a reduction in peripheral resistance in these patients.", 
    "414": "To determine whether limitation of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with improved systolic and diastolic function, quantitative two-dimensional echocardiograms and Doppler of 40 patients, who were randomized on day 3 after a first Q-wave anterior MI to receive therapy with captopril (12.5 mg t.i.d.) or placebo for 6 weeks, were analyzed for LV volumes (Simpson's rule) and mass (3D reconstruction), remodeling parameters and peak early (E) and late (A) transmitral flow velocities and deceleration times (DT) at 3 days, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. Compared to placebo over 1 year, captopril limited (p < 0.001) the increase in diastolic volume and mass, increased LV ejection fraction and diastolic E/A ratio, and decreased DT, the frequency of E and A reversal, infarct expansion and aneurysm frequency but volume/ mass ratio was unchanged. Captopril over the first 6 weeks after a first Q-wave anterior MI limited LV remodeling and hypertrophy and improved both systolic and diastolic function up to 1 year.", 
    "415": "The present study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor moexipril with that of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in postmenopausal women with mild-to-moderate hypertension. After a 4-week single-blind placebo period, 97 postmenopausal hypertensive women (42-74 years of age) with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95-114 mm Hg were randomized to receive either once daily moexipril 15 mg or HCTZ 25 mg for a 12-week double-blind treatment period. At study endpoint, HCTZ caused significantly greater increases from baseline in serum uric acid levels than did moexipril (0.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, p < 0.01). Furthermore, 12-week treatment with HCTZ resulted in significant increases in glucose (+11.0 +/- 4.1 mg/dl) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (+0.3 +/- 0.1 mg/dl) and a significant decrease in HDL (-3.2 +/- 0.7 mg/dl). In contrast, moexipril treatment was not associated with significant changes in any metabolic parameter. Both drugs efficiently lowered SDBP with reductions of -10.0 +/- 1.3 and -11.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg in the moexipril and HCTZ group, respectively. Clinical adverse events were reported by a greater percentage of HCTZ patients (53%) than moexipril patients (40%), with headache and rhinitis as the most frequent events. The results indicate that moexipril was better tolerated than HCTZ in postmenopausal women and did not adversely affect metabolic parameters. Both drugs were effective in lowering blood pressure.",

A 4 week placebo run-in period followed by 6 weeks of treatment. Four hundred and fifty-six patients from office practice (22 centres) with mild to moderate hypertension enrolled and 426 with diastolic pressure > or = 100 mm Hg at the end of run-in period were randomized. Main outcome measures were reduction in sitting systolic (SBP) and sitting diastolic (DBP) blood pressure.",

For these combinations, the adjusted mean reductions in DBP from baseline to last visit were 14.1 and 16.0 mm Hg, respectively. Response surface analysis provided further evidence that these combinations were optimal for antihypertensive efficacy. All treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between treatment groups; the profile of adverse events on combination therapy was mild and consistent with that of each monocomponent.", 
    "419": "All dosage combinations of verapamil SR and trandolapril produced significantly greater reduction of blood pressure than the monotherapy at the same dosage.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of these drugs on LBF by simultaneous use of ICG infusion and echo-Doppler.", 
    "421": "The study was performed according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over design in nine healthy male volunteers. After an overnight fast and an equilibration period, subjects received a continuous i.v. indocyanine green (ICG) infusion for 4 h. At presumed ICG steady state (t=45 min), subjects were dosed with oral nifedipine (20 mg), captopril (50 mg) or placebo. During the experiment, blood sampling for ICG assay and measurement of portal venous blood flow (echo-Doppler) took place regularly. Treatments were compared using analysis of variance. Differences are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).",

After captopril, the AUC values were 8-10% lower compared with placebo but the 95% CIs included zero. Portal venous flow was 15% (+ 5, + 86 ml min(-1)) higher compared to placebo after nifedipine but not after captopril (-3%; -49, +33 ml min(-1)). The duration of effect on liver blood flow lasted approximately 2 h but was variable (range: 40-160 min). The time to maximal blood flow increase and the duration of effect after nifedipine were very similar for both measures of LBF. Changes in ICG concentrations could be reasonably well predicted from the changes in portal blood flow.", 
    "423": "Nifedipine increases LBF for a substantial period of time but the effect is variable between subjects. This effect could be detected by both the ICG method and echo-Doppler and the findings of both methods were in agreement. In this respect it is likely that captopril does not influence LBF in healthy volunteers as no effect was detected with either method.", 
    "424": "Protease inhibitors are an important new class of agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The purpose of our trial was to determine the feasibility of combining the protease inhibitor saquinavir with a 96-hour continuous intravenous infusion of cyclophosphamide (800 mg/M2), doxorubicin (50 mg/M2, and etoposide (240 mg/M2) (CDE) plus filgrastim in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated with HIV infection. The effect of saquinavir on CDE-induced myelosuppression, CD4 lymphopenia, and non-hematologic toxicity was also sought. Twelve patients with HIV-related lymphoma received CDE every 28 or more days. All patients received saquinavir (600mg PO TID), filgrastim and Pneumocystis carinii and fungal prophylaxis. Patients also received either stavudine (n = 2) or both stavudine and didanosine (n = 10). Toxicity was analyzed using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for each cycle and the data were compared with the data from our prior study of CDE plus didanosine. An interim analysis was performed after accrual of the first 12 patients in order to assess toxicity. Severe (grade 3 or 4) mucositis occurred in eight of 12 patients (67%) treated with CDE plus saquinavir compared with three of 25 patients (12%) in our prior study treated with CDE without saquinavir (P < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, saquinavir use was the only factor associated with a significantly greater risk of severe mucositis (relative risk 7.9; P = 0.03). Saquinavir use was not associated with a significant difference in the incidence of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia, chemotherapy dose reduction, or in the degree of myelosuppression. The decrease in CD4 lymphocytes for patients treated with saquinavir (absolute decrease of 23/microL, or a 26% decrease from baseline) was significantly less than for patients treated without saquinavir in the prior study (absolute decrease of 91/microL, or 42% decrease from baseline; P = 0.05). Four of 10 patients (40%) treated with saquinavir had an increase in CD4 lymphocytes of > or = 10/microL compared with none of 25 patients (0%) treated without saquinavir (P < 0.001). Combination of the protease inhibitor saquinavir with infusional CDE in patients with HIV-associated lymphoma was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of severe mucositis. This finding suggests that saquinavir may alter the metabolism of one of more of the cytotoxic agents in the CDE regimen, and underscores the need for careful investigation regarding the use of the protease inhibitors in patients receiving chemotherapy.", 
    "425": "Pulmonary dysfunction contributes to exercise intolerance in patients with chronic heart failure, and ACE-inhibition improves the functional capacity of these subjects. In this study, we investigated whether and how ACE-inhibitors affect pulmonary function and ventilatory response during exercise in chronic heart failure. Twenty patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% underwent pulmonary function tests and exercise evaluation with analysis of expired gases before and after 1 year of treatment with enalapril (10 mg bid). To explore whether or not the respiratory influence of ACE-inhibitors is peculiar to the syndrome of cardiac failure, we also studied 19 subjects with mild, untreated primary hypertension who followed the same protocol. In this group, enalapril exerted a neutral effect on pulmonary function. In chronic heart failure patients, lung volumes were abnormal and did not improve after enalapril treatment; on the contrary, alveolar diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide increased towards normal values. Exercise tolerance time, peak exercise oxygen consumption, ventilation, and tidal volume also improved and the dead space to tidal volume ratio was reduced at the peak exercise and intermediate exercise phases (20, 60 W). Changes in carbon monoxide diffusion were positively correlated to those occurring during peak exercise oxygen consumption. A negative correlation was found between the variations in oxygen consumption and those in dead space to tidal volume ratio at peak exercise. We conclude that in patients with chronic heart failure, ACE-inhibition restores diffusing lung properties and improves ventilation-perfusion matching during exercise. In this syndrome, sustained reduction in gas exchange resistance is a fundamental therapeutic property of this class of drugs.", 
    "426": "Renal function declines progressively in patients with diabetic nephropathy and the decline may be slowed by some preventive interventions. Optimized and intensive insulin therapy delays the onset and slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, dietary restriction, avoiding a high protein intake, could be effective in reducing glomerular hyperfiltration. Finally, there is evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce renal damage by one or more mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects. Some controversial aspects of the prevention of diabetic kidney disease are presented and discussed.", 
    "427": "Between 5 and 20% of children with type 1 diabetes may develop microalbuminuria as a sign of incipient nephropathy starting in early puberty. Permanent microalbuminuria has to be distinguished from intermittent and transient microalbuminuria with unknown prognostic relevance. A review of clinical risk factors, retinal examination and an ambulatory 24-h blood pressure profile are recommended. Non-pharmacological interventions such as the improvement of glycemic control, the cessation of smoking or the feasibility of a low protein diet should always be considered. Concerning pharmacological intervention, in particular ACE-inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial in adolescents with hypertension but may also be renoprotective in normotensive patients with microalbuminuria. However, long-term studies with ACE-inhibitors in normotensive patients have shown negligible changes in the glomerular filtration rate, which better reflects the renal status during treatment than changes in the albumin excretion rate. Nevertheless, such treatment is currently recommended also for normotensive adolescents if other interventions are not successful.", 
    "428": "The prevalence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is found in approximately 500,000 individuals in Italy. The annual incidence can be crudely estimated to be 100,000 events. This represents a major health care problem and generates questions about the rational allocation of public resources devoted to health care, specially since Italy has a National Health Service. We focused on the economics of adding captopril administration to standard care in Italy in AMI patients matching the entry criteria of the SAVE study. The cost effectiveness ratio(s) was explored under different assumptions on the effectiveness and on the cost of the intervention. In our base case, administering captopril has an incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio of 14.708 million lira (1 US $ = 1529 lira in December 1996) per life year saved (LYS) (maximum range 7.171-21.003). This means that a net investment to the NHS of approximately 12 billion lira over 4 years to treat 10,000 patients matching the entry criteria of the SAVE trial will prevent 410 cardiovascular deaths (i.e. 33.229 million lira per cardiovascular death prevented) and save approximately 928 (discounted) to 1027 (not discounted) LYS over the same time period. Results are sensitive to the cost of captopril and of revascularisation procedures.", 
    "429": "Saliva and salivary gland homogenates of Ixodes scapularis contain a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity that accounts for the previously described salivary kininase activity of this tick. Reversed phase HPLC and laser desorption mass spectrography of the reaction products identified bradykinin fragment 1-7 and 1-5 as being produced subsequent to incubation of purified salivary kininase with bradykinin. The activity was inhibited by captopril and EDTA and was activated by cobalt and manganese, a behavior similar to that displayed by angiotensin-converting enzymes of vertebrate and invertebrate origins.", 
    "430": "It has been postulated that exaggerated renal sensitivity to angiotensin II may be involved in the development and maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). The purpose of this study was to compare the renal vascular responses to short-term angiotensin II infusions (50 ng/kg/min, i.v.) in conscious SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Renal cortical blood flow was measured in conscious rats by using quantitative renal perfusion imaging by magnetic resonance, and blood pressure was measured by an indwelling carotid catheter attached to a digital blood pressure analyzer. Renal vascular responses to angiotensin II were similar in control SHRs and WKY rats. Pretreatment with captopril to block endogenous production of angiotensin II significantly augmented the renal vascular response to exogenous angiotensin II in the SHRs but not in the WKY rats. The renal vascular responses to angiotensin II were significantly greater in captopril-pretreated SHRs than in WKY rats (cortical blood flow decreased by 1.66 +/- 0.13 ml/min/g cortex in WKY rats compared with 2.15 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g cortex in SHR; cortical vascular resistance increased by 10.5 +/- 1.4 mm Hg/ml/min/g cortex in WKY rats compared with 15.6 +/- 1.7 mm Hg/ml/min/g cortex in SHRs). Responses to angiotensin II were completely blocked in both strains by pretreatment with the angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonist losartan. Results from this study in conscious rats confirm previous findings in anesthetized rats that (a) the short-term pressor and renal vascular responses to angiotensin II are mediated by the AT1 receptor in both SHRs and WKY rats, and (b) the renal vascular responses to angiotensin II are enhanced in SHRs compared with WKY rats when endogenous production of angiotensin II is inhibited by captopril pretreatment.", 
    "431": "1. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. 2. A biochemical study was performed in order to analyse the effect of the NO-donors, SIN-1 and diethylamine/NO (DEA/NO), and of an aqueous solution of nitric oxide on the ACE activity in plasma from 3-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats and on ACE purified from rabbit lung. SIN-1 significantly inhibited the activity of both enzymes in a concentration-dependent way between 1 and 100 microM. DEA/NO inhibited the activity of purified ACE from 0.1 microM to 10 microM and plasma ACE, with a lower potency, between 1 and 100 microM. An aqueous solution of NO (100 and 150 microM) also inhibited significantly the activity of both enzymes. Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated an apparent competitive inhibition of Hip-His-Leu hydrolysis by NO-donors. 3. Modulation of ACE activity by NO was also assessed in the rat carotid artery by comparing contractions elicited by angiotensin I (AI) and AII. Concentration-response curves to both peptides were performed in arteries with endothelium in the presence of the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10 microM), and the inhibitor of NO formation, L-NAME (0.1 mM). NO, which is still released from endothelium in the presence of 10 microM ODQ, elicited a significant inhibition of AI contractions at low concentrations (1 and 5 nM). In the absence of endothelium, 1 microM SIN-1 plus 10 microM ODQ, as well as 10 microM DEA/NO plus 10 microM ODQ induced a significant inhibition on AI-induced contractions at 1 and 5 nM and at 1-100 nM, respectively. 4. In conclusion, we demonstrated that (i) NO and NO-releasing compounds inhibit ACE activity in a concentration-dependent and competitive way and that (ii) NO release from endothelium physiologically reduces conversion of AI to AII.", 
    "432": "The JCR:LA-cp rat is a unique strain that, if homozygous for the autosomal recessive cp gene, is obese and exhibits the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Obese male rats spontaneously develop advanced atherosclerosis and ischemic myocardial lesions. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was administered to obese rats at 30 mg/kg body weight from 6 to 39 weeks of age. There were no significant changes in food consumption or body weights of the treated animals. Insulin sensitivity was not improved. Plasma insulin levels were unaltered, but the volume density of the islets of Langerhans was halved, reflecting both reduced hyperplasia and a more normal islet structure. Triglyceride concentrations were not reduced, but unesterified cholesterol and cholesteryl esters decreased by 50% and 34%, respectively (p < 0.01). The impaired nitric oxide-mediated vascular relaxation of the obese rats was not improved, and the relaxant sensitivity to acetylcholine as indicated by the median effective concentration (EC50) was reduced. In vitro, captopril significantly reduced the basal tension of aortic rings from untreated rats, antagonized the contractile effects of norepinephrine, and induced complete relaxation of the contraction in response to 10(-7) M norepinephrine. The severity of spontaneous, raised atherosclerotic lesions of the aortic arch at age 39 weeks was not significantly decreased by captopril treatment. In contrast, the frequency of ischemic myocardial lesions was reduced by 78% (p < 0.01). The protective effects of captopril on the heart and pancreas in this animal model of type II diabetes and atherosclerosis are probably the result of its bradykinin-enhancing effects.", 
    "433": "Nepicastat (RS-25560-197) is a novel, selective, and potent inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which modulates catecholamine levels (reduces norepinephrine and elevates dopamine) in cardiovascular tissues. This study was designed to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of nepicastat. Acute oral administration of nepicastat (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) produced attenuation of the pressor and positive chronotropic responses to preganglionic sympathetic nerve stimulation (about twofold to sixfold shift in the frequency-response curve) in pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In inactin-anesthetized SHRs, the antihypertensive effects of nepicastat (3 mg/kg, i.v.) were accompanied by a significant decrease in renal vascular resistance (38%), a tendency toward an increase in renal blood flow (22%), and no adverse effects on urine output and Na/K excretion. In conscious, unrestrained, telemetry-implanted SHRs, nepicastat (30 and 100 mg/kg/day for 30 days) produced dose-dependent decreases in mean arterial blood pressure (peak decrease of 20 and 42 mm Hg, respectively) without evoking reflex tachycardia. Long-term, concurrent administration of nepicastat (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and a subthreshold dose of enalapril (1 mg/kg/day, p.o.) produced greater antihypertensive effects than those produced by nepicastat alone. In normal dogs, nepicastat (5.0 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d., for 4.5 days) blunted the positive chronotropic and pressor response to tyramine. These findings suggest that nepicastat functionally modulates sympathetic drive to cardiovascular tissues and may be of value in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders associated with overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system such as hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "434": "The relationship between the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein, a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo, and administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, which suppresses smooth muscle cells proliferation in denuded arteries, was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats using the in situ hybridization technique and immunohistochemical study. The effect of cilazapril on neointimal formation through modification of bFGF expression was evaluated using the increased tissue expression of the renin-angiotensin system in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Arterial injury was produced by using balloon catheter denudation in the left carotid artery of rats. The effects were evaluated 2 weeks later. bFGF mRNA and protein were observed only in the endothelial cells of sham-operated rats. bFGF mRNA and protein were observed in both endothelial cells and intimal smooth muscle cells in operated rats receiving only vehicle. Expression of bFGF mRNA and protein was suppressed in both endothelial cells and intimal smooth muscle cells of operated rats receiving cilazapril. These data suggest that cilazapril suppresses smooth muscle cell proliferation through modification of the expression of bFGF mRNA and bFGF protein in addition to other genes.", 
    "435": "1. Progression to renal failure may be linked to the degree of proteinuria through tubulo-interstitial mechanisms. However, there are no data in man on the kinetics of proximal renal tubular protein catabolism or markers of tubular injury before and after lisinopril. We developed a method to allow such studies, and found increased tubular catabolism of 99mTc-labelled aprotinin (Trasylol) in patients with nephrotic range proteinuria which was associated with increased ammonia excretion. 2. In this study, 10 patients with mild renal impairment (51Cr-EDTA clearance 63.7 +/- 8.3 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2) and heavy proteinuria (8.2 +/- 2.3 g/ 24 h) were given lisinopril (10-20 mg) for 6 weeks. Renal tubular catabolism of intravenous aprotinin was measured before and after lisinopril by renal imaging and urinary excretion of the free radiolabel over 26 h. Fractional degradation was calculated from these data. Fresh timed urine collections were also analysed for ammonia excretion every fortnight from 6 weeks before treatment. Total urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and the more tubulo-specific N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase 'A2' isoenzyme were also measured. 3. After lisinopril proteinuria fell significantly as expected (from 9.5 +/- 1.6 to 4.5 +/- 1.0 g/24 h, P < 0.01). This was associated with a reduction in metabolism over 26 h (from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1% dose/h, P < 0.01) and in fractional degradation of aprotinin (from 0.08 +/- 0.02 to 0.04 +/- 0.007/h, P < 0.04). Ammonia excretion also fell significantly (from 1.2 +/- 0.1 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/h, P < 0.0001), as did both total urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (P < 0.0001) and the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase 'A2' isoenzyme (P < 0.015). These observations after lisinopril treatment have not been described previously. There was no significant change in blood pressure nor in glomerular haemodynamics.", 
    "436": "1. Associations of intrauterine exposure to maternal undernutrition with later hypertension and coronary heart disease in the human population have been duplicated in the rat. Fetal exposure to low protein diets produces offspring that develop raised systolic blood pressure by the age of weaning. This animal model of 'programmed' hypertension was used to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the initiation and maintenance of high blood pressure. 2. Pregnant rats were fed diets containing 18 or 9% casein from conception until littering. The offspring from these pregnancies were administered captopril either between 2 and 4 weeks of age, or from 10 to 12 weeks of age. 3. The feeding of low protein diets in pregnancy had no effect upon the reproductive ability of female rats and the offspring generated were of normal birthweight. By 4 weeks of age the male and female offspring of low-protein-fed dams had systolic blood pressures that were 24-25 mmHg higher than those of rats exposed to a control diet in utero. 4. Treatment of 10-week-old female offspring with captopril for 2 weeks indicated that angiotensin II formation may play a role in the maintenance of high blood pressure in low-protein-exposed rats. While captopril had no significant effect upon systolic pressures of rats exposed to the control diet in intrauterine life, the systolic blood pressures of low-protein animals rapidly declined by 31 mmHg. 5. Administration of captopril to male and female offspring between 2 and 4 weeks of age exerted long-term effects upon systolic blood pressure. Eight weeks after cessation of treatment, at an age where maximal blood pressures are achieved, captopril-treated, low-protein-exposed rats had similar blood pressures to normotensive rats exposed to the protein-replete diet in utero. 6. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the elevation of adult blood pressure associated with fetal exposure to a maternal low-protein diet, is prevented by early administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The actions of angiotensin II in the late suckling period may be a critical determinant of long-term cardiovascular functions in these animals.", 
    "437": "The expression of Fos protein (Fos immunoreactivity, Fos-ir) was mapped in the brain of rats subjected to an angiotensin-dependent model of thirst and salt appetite. The physiological state associated with water and sodium ingestion was produced by the concurrent subcutaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg; Furo/Cap treatment). The animals were killed 2 h posttreatment, and the brains were processed for Fos-ir to assess neural activation. Furo/Cap treatment significantly increased Fos-ir density above baseline levels both in structures of the lamina terminalis and hypothalamus known to mediate the actions of ANG II and in hindbrain regions associated with blood volume and pressure regulation. Furo/Cap treatment also typically increased Fos-ir density in these structures above levels observed after administration of furosemide or captopril separately. Fos-ir was reduced to a greater extent in forebrain than in hindbrain areas by a dose of captopril (100 mg/kg sc) known to block the actions of ACE in the brain. The present work provides further evidence that areas of lamina terminalis subserve angiotensin-dependent thirst and salt appetite.", 
    "438": "To elucidate the contribution of the renin-angiontensin system (RAS) to glomerular injury in salt-sensitive hypertension, we investigated the chronic effects of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and the angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonist (AT1a) TCV-116 in Dahl-Iwai rats. Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats receiving 8% salt diet for 6 wk were simultaneously treated with cilazapril (n = 6), TCV-116 (n = 6), or saline (n = 14). The 8% salt diet markedly increased systolic blood pressure (SBP), urinary protein, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) excretion compared with 0.3% salt-treated S (n = 6) or salt-resistant (n = 6) rats. Although neither cilazapril nor TCV-116 reduced the elevated SBP, TCV-116 significantly lowered urinary protein and NAG excretion. Histologically, 8% salt treatment in S rats induced progressive sclerotic and proliferative glomerular changes, which were ameliorated by both drugs. TCV-116 increased the glomerular diameter. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the increased level of type III collagen in the mesangium of 8% salt-treated S rats, which was completely reversed by TCV-116. Competitive RT-PCR of mRNA extracted from the glomeruli revealed that 8% salt treatment significantly increased the levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and platelet-derived growth factor B-chain and that TCV-116 significantly reduced the levels of PCNA and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Thus, although the chronic RAS-inhibition in salt-sensitive hypertension exerted a histologically renoprotective effect by both ways without lowering blood pressure, the RAS inhibition due to AT1a had more beneficial advantages of reducing proteinuria and attenuating the levels of glomerular TGF-beta1 and extracellular matrix.", 
    "439": "Neonatal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in rats induces irreversible renal histological abnormalities, including papillary atrophy and an impaired urinary concentrating ability. The aim was to investigate urinary acidification and net acid excretion in adult Wistar rats treated neonatally with enalapril (10 mg . kg-1 . day-1) or vehicle from 5 to 24 days of age. Analyses were performed in both metabolic balance studies and renal clearance experiments performed under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia. There were no differences between groups in urine pH or urinary excretion rates of bicarbonate, titratable acid, or ammonium, neither during control conditions nor after chronic NH4Cl loading (assessed before and after Na2SO4 infusion). Glomerular filtration rate, maximal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption, and the urine-to-blood PCO2 gradient in alkaline urine during NaHCO3 infusion did not differ between groups. Neonatally enalapril-treated rats showed a urine concentration defect and papillary damage. In conclusion, neonatal enalapril treatment produces a differentiated abnormality in tubular function in which urine concentration is impaired but urinary acidification and net acid excretion are intact.", 
    "440": "Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) degrades vasoactive peptides, including the natriuretic peptides, angiotensin II, and endothelin-1. Systemic inhibition of NEP does not consistently lower blood pressure, even though it increases natriuretic peptide concentrations and causes natriuresis and diuresis. We therefore investigated the direct effects of local inhibition of NEP on forearm resistance vessel tone.", 
    "441": "Four separate studies were performed, each with 90-minute drug infusions. In the first study, 10 healthy subjects received a brachial artery infusion of the NEP inhibitor candoxatrilat (125 nmol/min), which caused a slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (12+/-2%; P=0.001). In a second two-phase study, 6 healthy subjects received, 4 hours after enalapril (20 mg) or placebo, an intra-arterial infusion of the NEP inhibitor thiorphan (30 nmol/min). Thiorphan caused similar degrees of local forearm vasoconstriction (P=0.6) after pretreatment with both placebo (13+/-1%, P=0.006) and enalapril (17+/-6%, P=0.05). In a third three-phase study, 8 healthy subjects received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min), the endothelin ETA antagonist BQ-123 (100 nmol/min), and both combined. Thiorphan caused local forearm vasoconstriction (13+/-1%, P=0.0001); BQ-123 caused local vasodilatation (33+/-3%, P=0.0001). Combined thiorphan and BQ-123 caused vasodilatation (32+/-1%, P=0.0001) similar to BQ-123 alone (P=0.98). In a fourth study, 6 hypertensive patients (blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg) received intra-arterial thiorphan (30 nmol/min). Thiorphan caused a slowly progressive forearm vasoconstriction (10+/-2%, P=0.0001).", 
    "442": "Inhibition of local NEP causes vasoconstriction in forearm resistance vessels of both healthy volunteers and patients with hypertension. The lack of effect of ACE inhibition on the vasoconstriction produced by thiorphan and its absence during concomitant ETA receptor blockade suggest that it is mediated by endothelin-1 and not angiotensin II. These findings may help to explain the failure of systemic NEP inhibition to lower blood pressure.", 
    "443": "The present study was performed to compare cardioprotective effects of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, imidapril, and of a Ca2+ channel antagonist, amlodipine, against the cardiac hypertrophy in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) at the established stage of hypertension. Fifteen-week-old SHRs were given imidapril (2 and 5 mg/kg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 8 weeks. Three hours after the 1st treatment, imidapril moderately reduced blood pressure without changing heart rate, while amlodipine caused a marked reduction in blood pressure accompanied by transient tachycardia. At the end of the treatments, ventricular weight in the imidapril-treated groups was markedly lower, but that in the amlodipine-treated group was only slightly lower than that in the vehicle-treated group. Myocardial collagen content in the imidapril-treated group tended to be decreased, and significant reduction was observed in the low-dose group. In another experiment, the isolated heart of the imidapril-treated animals demonstrated better cardiac compliance than that in the vehicle-treated animals. In contrast, amlodipine failed to improve cardiac function. The present results suggest that imidapril possesses advantageous effects to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and deteriorated cardiac function in SHRs of established stage of hypertension as compared with amlodipine.", 
    "444": "We examined the effect of non-SH-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidaprilat on hydroxyl radical (.OH) generation using microdialysis. Salicylic acid in Ringer's solution containing sodium salicylate (0.5 n mol microL-1 min-1) was infused directly through a microdialysis probe to detect the generation of .OH as reflected by the formation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) in the myocardium of anesthetized rats. We compared the ability of two non-SH-containing ACE inhibitors (imidaprilat and enalaprilat) with an -SH-containing ACE inhibitor (captopril) to scavenge the .OH. When iron (II) was administered to animals pretreated with these three ACE inhibitors, a decrease in 2,3-DHBA of all three compounds was observed, as compared with the iron (II) only-treated group. All three ACE inhibitors were able to scavenge .OH generated by the action of iron (II). However, imidaprilat is a free radical scavenger more potent than enalaprilat. These results suggested that ACE inhibitors are probably not only related to the presence of the SH radical.", 
    "445": "Diabetes mellitus is associated with alterations in a number of key metabolic pathways. Despite theoretical concerns, clinically significant alterations in the pharmacokinetic properties of commonly prescribed drugs are relatively uncommon. Indeed, dose adjustment is rarely required in the setting of well controlled diabetes mellitus. However, significant alterations in drug handling may occur in the context of poor metabolic control or in the presence of complications such as nephropathy. Metformin use may be complicated by lactic acidosis. Fortunately, this is a rare occurrence providing that the agent is not used in circumstances in which it is contraindicated. Indeed, the risk of death from metformin-related lactic acidosis is similar in magnitude to the risk of death related to hypoglycaemia in sulphonylurea-treated patients. The novel hypoglycaemic agent troglitazone may be associated with abnormalities in liver function in approximately 2% of patients. Discontinuation of treatment is followed by normalisation of liver enzyme levels. Current prescribing information recommends frequent monitoring of liver function tests and immediate cessation of therapy if abnormalities develop. In addition to disturbances in intermediary metabolism, diabetes mellitus may also lead to chronic microvascular and marcovascular complications. Thus, in addition to the use of drugs for the control of blood glucose, patients with diabetes mellitus are likely to be prescribed medication for associated conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Such medication includes the ACE inhibitors which are contraindicated in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. This complication may be theoretically more common in patients with diabetes mellitus because of accelerated atherosclerosis. However, in clinical practice this is an uncommon occurrence in the absence of clinical features that should alert the treating clinician that an individual patient might be at high risk. Although caution should also be used with beta-blocker therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus, current evidence suggests that, like ACE inhibitors, these drugs may be particularly useful in this patient group.", 
    "446": "Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with captopril (100 mg . kg-1 . day-1) throughout development and during the first 16 wk of life leads to a reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy. Blood pressures and hypertrophy are reduced in these animals (vs. untreated SHR) for up to 24 wk after discontinuation of the drug. We used conventional blot hybridization and Western analysis to examine hypertrophy-dependent gene expression during this period. Ventricular expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide gene was reduced by >90% at 16 wk of age in the captopril-treated SHR. Expression increased in the 24 wk after discontinuation of treatment, but remained well below that of the untreated SHR. A similar reduction in ventricular c-myc gene expression was seen with captopril treatment. Neither renal expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide gene nor ventricular expression of the c-fos gene was affected by captopril. This study demonstrates that captopril treatment during a critical period of development in the SHR leads to a sustained reduction in hypertrophy-dependent myocardial gene expression, which does not revert to levels seen in the untreated SHR after discontinuation of the drug.", 
    "447": "In order to study the cellular mode of renin secretion, stereological methods were used to estimate number and volume of rat renin secretory granules during stimulation of the renin system. An acute decrease in renal perfusion pressure to 40 mmHg for 5 min increased plasma renin concentration (PRC) twofold, but did not significantly change the number of renin granules per arteriole or the renin-containing volume of the arteriole. Chronic stimulation was achieved by a combination of low-salt diet and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) for 14 days, and resulted in a 36-fold increase in PRC, a 20-fold increase in the number of granules per arteriole, and a 17-fold increase in the arteriolar volume that contained renin. An acute decrease in renal perfusion pressure to 40 mmHg for 5 min in the chronically stimulated rats increased PRC further (1.6-fold), and significantly reduced the number of granules per arteriole by 4000 (45% reduction), but did not change the renin-containing arteriolar volume significantly. The average renin granule size was 0.35 microm3 with no significant differences among the groups. We conclude that recruited granular cells contribute significantly to renin release, and that all granular cells along the arteriole participate in secretory responses. The reduced number of renin granules after acute stimulation is compatible with exocytosis as the dominating mechanism of renin release.", 
    "448": "It is commonly accepted that the tolerance to insulin and hyperglycemia of the patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is due to some defect of insulin receptors or disturbances in the signaling pathway of the cell. This disease is often accompanied by hypertension. In this paper the high activity of plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) (kallikrein activity was 6-8 times higher than normal), of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (4 times greater than normal), and of leukocyte elastase (2.7 times higher than normal) were demonstrated in plasma of patients with NIDDM. Increasing of KKS activity was coincident with rising of ACE activity, which may be the cause of the fast bradykinin inactivation and arising of hypertension. The treatment with ACE inhibitor during 3 months (4 mg of Perindopril per day) decreased ACE activity in patients' plasma which was accompanied with decreasing of the arterial pressure and some restoration of the carbohydrate metabolism indicators. The hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamping of 7 patients with NIDDM and essential hypertension showed that ACE-inhibitor (Perindopril, 4 mg) prevented bradykinin from destruction and increased the glucose consumption by tissues. The high activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and secretion of the elastase in NIDDM patients' plasma and/or instability of plasmatic and granular membranes of leukocyte in conditions of hyperglycaemic plasma are probably the cause of endothelial irritation and high ACE secretion. Secondly, the leukocyte may be the cause of injuring and decreasing of susceptibility of the cell receptors for insulin and bradykinin.", 
    "449": "The aim of the PIMICS project was to create, for the first time in Switzerland, a registry of data concerning epidemiology and therapy in patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction covering all regions of the country. During 1995/96 73 Swiss hospitals of all categories took part in the PIMICS project. The ratio between males and females in the 3877 registered patients was 2.6:1 (2791 men vs. 1086 women). Female patients were significantly older than males (70.4 +/- 12.0 years vs. 63.4 +/- 12.6 years; p < 0.0001). The prevalence of risk factors differed between men and women: significantly more women had hypertension or diabetes, whereas smoking was more prevalent in males. The median delay between onset of symptoms and arrival at the hospital was 5.5 hours. Thrombolysis and primary angioplasty were more frequently performed in men (40.4% vs. 31.2% in women, p < 0.0001, and 5.7% in men vs. 3.5% in women, p = 0.005 respectively). During the acute phase males were treated more frequently with betablockers. The overall in-hospital mortality was 9.1%. It was significantly higher in female patients (13.5% vs. 7.4% in men; p < 0.0001) and in patients with reinfarction (14.5% vs. 7.1%; p < 0.0001). The mean hospital stay was 12.6 +/- 5.3 days. Only 7.7% of all patients with acute myocardial infarction were discharged within 6 days. At discharge, 51.7% were treated with betablockers and 69.3% with aspirin; 44.8% received ACE-inhibitors and only 13.8% lipid-lowering drugs. Follow-up measures such as coronary angiography and/or angioplasty or bypass surgery were performed significantly more often in males (45.0% vs. 32.9%; p < 0.0001). Likewise, men were more frequently assigned to a rehabilitation program than women (38.2% vs. 32.9%; p = 0.0004). The pre-hospital delay in patients with acute myocardial infarction remains too long. Primary and secondary prevention should be intensified in high risk groups, particularly in females. Thrombolysis and primary angioplasty as mainstays of treatment in acute myocardial infarction are generally used too sparingly, especially in women. With such measures the hospital stay could be shortened further.", 
    "450": "The goal of this study was to compare the direct costs associated with the prescription of thiazide diuretics, beta-receptor blockers (beta-blockers), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), a-receptor blockers (alpha-blockers), and calcium channel blockers (CCB) for the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and premature death in uncomplicated hypertension. We performed a cost-minimization analysis based on numbers-needed-to-treat (NNT) derived from the metaanalysis of 15 major clinical trials of hypertension treatment, and the average wholesale prices of both the most commonly prescribed and the least expensive drugs in each class. The inclusion criteria for clinical trials were that they be randomized, controlled trials of drug therapy of uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension with stroke, MI, or death as endpoints. The wholesale drug costs and the total direct outpatient treatment costs to prevent a stroke, MI or death among middle-aged and elderly hypertensives were our outcome measures. The estimated wholesale drug acquisition cost to prevent one major event (MI or stroke or death) ranged from $4730 to $346,236 among middle-aged patients, and from $1595 to $116,754 in the elderly; generic diuretic or beta-blocker therapy was more economical than treatment with an ACEI, alpha-blocker, or CCB. The associated 5-year NNT was 86 for middle-aged patients and 29 for elderly patients. Diuretic therapy remained more cost-effective even under the unlikely assumption that the newer drugs were 50% more effective than diuretics at preventing these major events. The costs associated with potassium supplementation did not eliminate the advantage of diuretics. Treatment costs to prevent major hypertensive complications are much lower with diuretics and beta-blockers than with ACEI, CCB, or alpha-blockers, especially in middle-aged patients.", 
    "451": "Improved understanding of the pathophysiologic course of heart failure has led to many advances in pharmacologic therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors represent the first effort at targeting neurohormonal activation in chronic heart failure. More recently, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been shown effective in blocking chronic sympathetic nervous system activation. The roles of digoxin and the newer, vasoselective calcium channel blockers in heart failure have been better defined. Other agents targeting the neurohormonal system are under investigation. These include angiotensin-receptor antagonists, aldosterone inhibitors, and endothelin antagonists. Experience with phosphodiesterase inhibitors and adrenergic agents has confirmed the importance of neurohormonal activation in progression of heart failure. Despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, diuretic, and digoxin therapy, mortality in heart failure remains high. Careful manipulation of the neurohormonal response to heart failure holds promise for altering the course of the disease.", 
    "452": "Sixty patients, mean age 82 +/- 8 years, with congestive heart failure, prior myocardial infarction, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and > or = 30 ventricular premature complexes per hour detected by 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms, and who were treated with diuretics, were randomized to treatment with benazepril 20 to 40 mg/day (30 patients) or to no benazepril (30 patients). At a median of 6 months after treatment, follow-up 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms showed that compared with no benazepril, benazepril caused no significant reduction in the number of ventricular premature complexes per hour or in the number of runs of ventricular tachycardia per 24 hours.", 
    "453": "The efficacy of the low-dose combination of bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide was compared with amlodipine and enalapril. The low-dose combination was found to be at least as effective as amlodipine and more effective than enalapril in both men and women.", 
    "454": "Left ventricular (LV) cavity obliteration during dobutamine echocardiography (DE) indicates a vigorous inotropic response to stress. Such a response may suggest the absence of coronary artery disease (CAD), but a small LV cavity may also preclude recognition of wall motion abnormalities. We sought to determine the frequency, correlates, accuracy, and prognostic value of the LV cavity obliteration response in 336 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography within 1 year of DE. Cavity obliteration was defined by contact of the opposite walls in the apical views during DE, and ischemia by detection of a new or worsening wall motion abnormality. Sensitivity was based on comparison with coronary anatomy in 220 patients without prior revascularization. The prognostic implications of cavity obliteration were examined by follow-up of 324 patients (96%) over 23 +/- 9 months for death, myocardial infarction, and late revascularization. Cavity obliteration was present in 86 of the 336 DE studies (26%). Baseline and stress hemodynamics were not predictive of cavity obliteration, which was associated with LV hypertrophy and female gender (p <0.0001), and inversely related to LV systolic dysfunction and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or diuretics (p <0.02). The sensitivity of DE was less in patients with cavity obliteration than the remainder, especially in single vessel (46% vs 92%, p <0.001) but also in multivessel CAD (73% vs 95%, p = 0.01). Irrespective of DE and angiographic results, cavity obliteration was a negative predictor for cardiac events (RR 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 to 0.87, p = 0.02) and death (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.09, p = 0.06). Even after exclusion of patients with LV dysfunction, cavity obliteration was an independent predictor of freedom from events (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.88, p = 0.02). Thus, LV cavity obliteration is a frequent response to DE, which compromises the sensitivity of DE but is correlated paradoxically with a favorable clinical outcome.", 
    "455": "Although bradykinin is thought to contribute to the effects of ACE inhibitors on the cardiovascular system, its precise role remains to be elucidated. Evidence suggests that bradykinin might be important in the upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) induced by ACE inhibitors, and the role of bradykinin in this effect has now been investigated with cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.", 
    "456": "The density of beta-ARs on the myocyte surface was determined with a binding assay with [3H]CGP-12177. Incubation of cultured myocytes for 24 hours with the ACE inhibitor captopril (1 micromol/L) increased beta-AR density by 35% and enhanced the response of cells to isoproterenol but not to forskolin. Neither an angiotensin-II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, CV-11974, nor angiotensin-I affected beta-AR density. However, the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 abolished the effect of captopril on beta-AR upregulation in a dose-dependent manner. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (20 nmol/L) but neither indomethacin nor L-NAME also inhibited captopril-induced upregulation of beta-ARs. Exogenous bradykinin increased the spontaneous beating frequency of cultured myocytes and Hoe 140 abolished this effect. Bradykinin level in the medium increased 1.4-fold by the treatment of cultured myocytes with captopril for 24 hours.", 
    "457": "The results suggest that captopril enhances beta-AR responsiveness by inducing beta-AR upregulation and that the latter effect is mediated by activation of bradykinin B2 receptors and protein kinase C. These observations also offer insight into the different roles of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "458": "Several large-scale trials have demonstrated improved survival with ACE-inhibitor therapy started during acute myocardial infarction. A systematic overview was conducted to resolve uncertainties regarding time of initiation, time course of effect, and identification of patients in whom the benefits or the risks may be greater.", 
    "459": "This overview aimed to include individual data from all randomized trials involving more than 1000 patients in which ACE-inhibitor treatment was started in the acute phase (0 to 36 hours) of myocardial infarction and continued for a short time (4 to 6 weeks). Data were available for 98,496 patients from 4 eligible trials, and the results were consistent among the trials. Thirty-day mortality was 7.1% among patients allocated to ACE inhibitors and 7.6% among control subjects, corresponding to a 7% (SD, 2%) proportional reduction (95% CI, 2% to 11%; 2P<0.004). This represented avoidance of approximately 5 (SD, 2) deaths per 1000 patients, with most of the benefit observed within the first week. The proportional benefit was similar in patients at different underlying risk. The absolute benefit was particularly large in some high-risk groups (ie, Killip class 2 to 3, heart rate > or = 100 bpm at entry) and in anterior MI. ACE-inhibitor therapy also reduced the incidence of nonfatal cardiac failure (14.6% versus 15.2%, 2P=0.01) but was associated with an excess of persistent hypotension (17.6% versus 9.3%, 2P<0.01) and renal dysfunction (1.3% versus 0.6%, 2P<0.01).",

    "461": "The current era has witnessed dramatic improvement in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, due in large part to the more widespread use of thrombolytic therapy aimed at quickly restoring perfusion in the infarct-related artery. This review addresses the role of adjunctive pharmacologic therapy in the thrombolytic era, recognizing that much of the available clinical trial data supporting the role of adjunctive pharmacologic treatment strategies was conducted in patient populations not widely exposed to reperfusion therapy. This review, therefore, explores the data supporting the incremental benefit of therapy with beta blockers, nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or magnesium in addition to thrombolytic therapy. Heparin and aspirin will not be discussed.",

The aim of this case report is to highlight the risks of using this drug during gestation. The authors present a case of captopril use during pregnancy, whose newborn developed acute renal failure and ductus arteriosus patency early in the newborn period. This presentation strengthens the importance of not only monitoring amniotic fluid volume and fetal growth, but also, during the newborn period, control the weight gain, diuresis, systemic arterial pressure and renal function, mainly in the first 72 hours of life.",

Preliminary study using the house-keeping gene, beta-actin confirmed that this method was accurate and reproducible for the quantitative detection of the genes. The system also has merit with regard to the dynamic range of the starting target molecule determination. We then investigated DNA copies of cytomegalovirus (CMV) gene in vivo. The results demonstrated on association between the quantitation of CMV-DNA copies and clinical manifestation associated with CMV infection of immunodeficiency states or infantile hepatitis. It was also successful for quantitative estimation by RT-PCR. Namely, the assay made it possible to discriminate drug-sensitive leukemia cells from resistant cells based on the MDR1 gene and dCK gene. Real time quantitative PCR assay may be useful in a variety of clinical fields.",

    "465": "Sixteen patients were studied after coronary artery bypass grafting. After admission to the intensive care unit, a 30-minute baseline measurement of systemic hemodynamics, oxygen transport, and gastric tonometry was performed. In 6 of 10 patients receiving enalaprilat and in each of 6 control patients, regional (splanchnic and leg) blood flows were measured also. After the baseline measurement period, 10 patients received a 0.5 mg bolus of enalaprilat and thereafter an incremental infusion of enalaprilat up to a total dose of 10 mg (mean 8.3; range 4 to 10 mg) was continued to reduce the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 70 to 80 mm Hg. A 30-minute measurement period was repeated 2 to 3 hours after the first measurement period. In the control group, the second measurement was performed at corresponding time points.",

No significant changes were observed either in systemic or regional blood flows. Systemic, pulmonary, and femoral vascular resistance indices decreased significantly in both groups. Gastric-arterial PCO2 difference did not change in either groups. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity decreased in the enalaprilat group (10.0 +/- 2.3 v 1.3 +/- 0.3 U x l(-1), P < .01), but plasma renin and endothelin-1 concentrations did not change in either group.",

    "468": "Cardiovascular complications are frequently present in insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients and confer a very poor prognosis. In this overview we critically analyse the current literature with regard to the benefits and also the possible harms of the available pharmacological treatment strategies in these patients. To date, insulin is the only hypoglycaemic agent which has been proven both effective and safe in NIDDM patients with cardiovascular complications. Also, several trials indicate that treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents may confer a substantial risk in such patients. Conventional antihypertensive treatment, including betablockers and diuretics, has been convincingly shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in diabetic nephropathy and in NIDDM patients. However, this may not be the case with newer antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Likewise, convincing evidence is lacking that these newer antihypertensive agents provide meaningful clinical benefit when compared to the conventional treatment regarding slower progression of diabetic nephropathy or their impact on lipid and glucose metabolism. Cholesterol lowering therapy with statins and aspirin treatment have also been repeatedly shown to improve the prognosis of diabetic patients with coronary heart disease.",

    "471": "The general sales of drugs in Estonia decreased almost twofold in all major pharmacological groups from 1989 to 1994 and subsequently increased by 10%-30% in 1995. Substantial differences in patterns of drug use between Estonia and the two Nordic countries were observed. The amount of prescription-only medicines used in Estonia was approximately 25% of that used in Finland and Sweden. The amount of over-the-counter drugs used was 61% of that used in Finland and 58% of that used in Sweden. In the drug use patterns in Estonia, some common trends can be noted: (1) persistent traditions, such as the low use of diuretics, beta-blockers, antithrombotics and inhalant anti-asthmatic drugs; (2) changes in prescription preferences--central anti-adrenergic drugs, pyrazolones, aminoglycosides and barbiturates are being replaced by calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, propionic acid derivatives, cephalosporins and benzodiazepines, respectively; (3) rapidly increasing use of drugs not prescribed in the 1980s, such as hormonal contraceptives, opioids and antiulcer drugs, which strongly improves the quality of pharmacotherapy in Estonia.",

The changes are more rapid in Estonia than in Finland and Sweden, but, because of a short observation period, the use of newer drugs not yet prevailing. The international differences in drug utilization observed in this study may possibly be related mainly to the prescription preferences (e.g. therapeutic traditions) and less dependent on the respective health care systems (e.g. reimbursement schemes) and economic state of the country.", 
    "473": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with and without a sulfhydryl group on intracellular production of cGMP, forearm blood flow, and neurohormonal factors during continuous transdermal application of nitroglycerin in patients with chronic heart failure. Platelet cGMP level and forearm blood flow were measured before and 5 min after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (NTG) in 20 patients with chronic heart failure during the following 4 phases: (1) baseline phase; (2) NTG phase (1 week after NTG tape 10 mg/day); (3) CPT phase (1 week after both captopril 37.5 mg/day and NTG tape 10 mg/day); and (4) ENL phase (1 week after both enalapril 5 mg/day and NTG tape 10 mg/day). The platelet GMP level before sublingual NTG and forearm blood flow were significantly higher during the 3 phases with NTG tape than during the control phase. The percent increases in platelet cGMP level and forearm blood flow after sublingual NTG were significantly lower during the NTG phase than during the baseline phase. In contrast, concomitant application of ACE inhibitors maintained the percent increase in platelet cGMP level and forearm blood flow. These results indicate that concomitant therapy with ACE inhibitors may be helpful in preventing the attenuation of intracellular cGMP production in patients with chronic heart failure during continuous transdermal application of NTG.", 
    "474": "The stability of enalapril 1 mg/mL (as the maleate) in deionized water, citrate buffer solution, and a sweetened suspending agent at two temperatures was studied. Twenty enalapril 10-mg tablets were crushed to a powder. Deionized water, citrate buffer solution, or sweetened vehicle was added to produce three 200-mL batches of each liquid; the expected final concentration of enalapril in each was 1 mg/mL. Each formulation was stored in 10 60-mL bottles, 5 of which were stored at 4 degrees C and 5 at 25 degrees C. Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 91 for visual inspection and analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography; pH was measured at each sampling time as well. The mean concentration of enalapril in the three liquids at 4 degrees C was > 94% of the initial concentration throughout the 91-day study period. At 25 degrees C, the mean concentration of enalapril was > 90% for 56 days and > 92% for 91 days in both citrate buffer solution and sweetened vehicle. The pH of the liquid prepared with deionized water and stored at 25 degrees C decreased by 2.0 pH units. Enalapril 1 mg/mL (as the maleate) in three extemporaneously compounded oral liquids was stable for 91 days at 4 and 25 degrees C with the exception of enalapril in deionized water, which was stable for only 56 days at 25 degrees C.",

To model such interactions, the effects of quinapril on cephalexin pharmacokinetics were investigated in rats. Blood cephalexin concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography, and the data were analyzed by a noncompartmental method and by fitting a bicompartmental model by a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach. Five groups of eight rats were examined. In the first three groups, cephalexin elimination kinetics after intra-arterial administration alone or in combination with quinapril given by the parenteral or the oral route were studied, and the occurrence of a pharmacokinetic interaction was not revealed. The absence of an effect of quinapril on cephalexin elimination after parenteral administration might be explained either by the higher affinity of cephalexin for the renal anionic transport system than that of quinapril or by the much higher concentrations of cephalexin than those of quinapril. In the last two groups, cephalexin was administered by the oral route alone or in combination with quinapril. The mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for cephalexin was increased by ca. 30% by coadministration of quinapril (40.1 versus 31.4 mg.h/liter; P = 0.04). The mean elimination clearance of cephalexin was significantly decreased by quinapril, from 0.81 to 0.64 liter/h/kg of body weight (P < 0.05), probably by competitive inhibition of cephalexin secretion at the tubular level. The mean absorption rate constant of cephalexin was significantly lowered by quinapril (from 0.249 to 0.177 h-1; P < 0.01), without modification of the extent of absorption (89%). This pharmacokinetic interaction could be explained by competitive inhibition of cephalexin active transport by quinapril at the intestinal level.",

Both ramipril and imidapril lowered blood pressure equally, which were not influenced by icatibant. Icatibant did not alter the regressive effect of imidapril, while it showed a tendency to increase LVM in the ramipril-treated rats. The changes of LVM induced by icatibant were significantly different between the ramipril- and the imidapril-treated rats, suggesting that the role of bradykinin in the antihypertrophic effect might differ among ACE inhibitors.",

A 2-ml saline load was administered ig at 300, 900, or 1200 mOsm/kg to rats with sham lesions or lesions of the SFO, and intake was measured periodically for 2 h. Hypertonic loads caused sham-lesioned rats, but not SFO-lesioned rats, to drink earlier in the test or to drink more water than did the isotonic load. Inhibition of ANG II synthesis in unoperated rats with 100 mg/kg of captopril reduced water intake only during the initial 15 min after a gavage of 1200 mOsm/kg saline. Loads of 900 and 1200 mOsm/kg both increased plasma osmolality and sodium concentration by 15 min after gavage without greatly affecting hematocrit or plasma protein concentration. Thus, the SFO is important for the osmotically-induced water drinking response after acute ig administration of hypertonic saline. With the possible exception of the first 15 min, this drinking response is independent of the peripheral synthesis of ANG II.", 
    "497": "The mechanism by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce red cell mass in renal transplant recipients with erythrocytosis is unclear. To examine the role of angiotensin II in this disorder, losartan (a competitive antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] receptor) was administered to 23 patients with erythrocytosis. Fourteen patients took 25 mg/d for 8 wk; nine others were treated with 50 mg/d for 8 wk. Hematocrit decreased from 0.527 +/- 0.027 to 0.487 +/- 0.045 after 8 wk (P < 0.01)--by at least 0.04 in 19 patients. Decrement in hematocrit in the initial 8 wk of therapy was significantly greater in patients administered 50 mg/d than in patients on 25 mg/d. Twelve of 14 patients initially treated with 25 mg/d showed a small change in hematocrit; the dose was increased to 50 mg/d for 8 more wk. Hematocrit decreased from 0.528 +/- 0.030 before losartan treatment to 0.483 +/- 0.055 after 16 wk (P < 0.01). After therapy, serum erythropoietin significantly decreased in eight patients with elevated baseline levels, but not in 15 patients with normal baseline levels; however, hematocrit significantly decreased in both groups. Losartan was withdrawn in 16 patients; hematocrit increased from 0.440 +/- 0.057 to 0.495 +/- 0.049 after 8.9 +/- 7.5 wk (P < 0.001), without change in serum erythropoietin. Thus, specific blockade of AT1 receptors inhibited erythropoiesis, suggesting a pathogenic role for angiotensin II in posttransplant erythrocytosis.", 
    "498": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been associated with the occurrence of adverse effects, including cough and angioneurotic edema. Accumulation of kinins has been suggested to play a major role in these adverse effects of ACE inhibitor, although conclusive evidence for such a role is lacking. We investigated whether ACE inhibition increases plasma extravasation in mice (Swiss, C57Bl/6J, and J129Sv/Ev strains) via inhibition of bradykinin metabolism and stimulation of neurogenic inflammatory mechanisms. Intravenous captopril and enalapril increased the extravasation of Evans blue dye in all tissues examined (trachea, stomach, duodenum, and pancreas). This effect was evident 15 minutes after drug administration. The particulate dye Monastral blue identified the sites of captopril-induced leakage in the microvasculature. Pretreatment with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 or with the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist SR 140333 inhibited captopril-evoked increase in plasma extravasation. In mice in which the gene encoding the bradykinin B2 receptor was disrupted by gene targeting, neither bradykinin nor captopril increased plasma extravasation. Pretreatment with Hoe 140 did not reduce the hypotensive response induced by captopril. The present findings suggest that ACE inhibition increases kinin levels in tissues and/or plasma. These increased kinin levels increase microvascular leakage in mouse airways and digestive tract via the release of tachykinins from terminals of primary sensory neurons. Exaggerated kinin production and the subsequent stimulation of peptide release from sensory nerves may be involved in adverse effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "499": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increase the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin and open Ca2+-activated K+ channels. The effects of these actions of ACE inhibitors on infarct size were investigated in open-chest dogs subjected to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Infarct size was assessed 6 hours after the onset of reperfusion, subsequent to 90 minutes of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The ACE inhibitor cilazaprilat was administered into the coronary artery 10 minutes before coronary occlusion, and infusion was continued until 1 hour after reperfusion. The bradykinin and NO concentrations in coronary venous blood 10 minutes after the onset of reperfusion were significantly higher in dogs treated with cilazaprilat (3 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) than in control animals. Although there were no significant differences in collateral flow during ischemia, infarct size in the cilazaprilat group was smaller than that in the control group (15.1+/-3.0% versus 46.7+/-4.2% of the area at risk, P<0.0001). The infarct size-limiting effect of cilazaprilat was partially reduced by either N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (an inhibitor of NO synthase) or iberiotoxin (a blocker of Ca2+-activated K+ channels) and was abolished by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester plus iberiotoxin. Indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) had no effect on the beneficial action of cilazaprilat. Inhibition of ACE thus reduced myocardial infarct size, an effect that was mediated by NO and the opening of Ca2+-activated K+ channels in canine hearts.", 
    "500": "Whole-body leucine flux was measured in eight patients with nephrotic syndrome and in five healthy subjects by primed-constant infusion of L-[1-13C leucine]. Plasma enrichment of 13C leucine and 13C alpha-keto-isocaproate (13C KIC) was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and expired 13CO2 was measured by isotope ration mass spectrometry. Leucine kinetics, calculated from the primary pool enrichment [13C leucine], showed no difference between the nephrotic patients and the control subjects. Kinetics derived from the reciprocal pool [1-13C KIC] enrichment, however, showed that leucine turnover rates were reduced in the nephrotic patients. The values (mumol/kg per h, means +/- SD) comparing the patients and the control subjects are as follows: rate of leucine release from protein degradation, 99 +/- 6 and 117 +/- 12 (P = 0.007); leucine oxidation rate, 15 +/- 7 and 22 +/- 3 (P = 0.04); rate of leucine incorporation into body protein [S], 84 +/- 10 and 95 +/- 6 (P = 0.04); protein turnover rate, 3.99 +/- 0.49 and 4.72 +/- 0.25 g/kg per d (P = 0.007). Nitrogen balance, measured only in the nephrotic patients, showed a mean positive balance of 0.5 g/d. In the nephrotic and control subjects, protein intake levels were 0.84 +/- 0.16 and 1.17 +/- 0.18 g/kg per d (P = 0.002), respectively, and energy intake levels were 33.3 +/- 8.5 and 33.9 +/- 2.4 kcal/kg per d, respectively. Linear correlations between leucine turnover rates and protein intake were highly significant. This study found that nephrotic patients given a modestly protein-restricted diet were able to maintain positive nitrogen balance. Moreover, leucine flux measurements showed downregulation of protein degradation and amino acid oxidation, reflecting appropriate adaptation to a lower protein intake.", 
    "501": "Rats injected with a single, 50-mg dose of bromoethylamine (BEA) developed papillary necrosis accompanied by sever interstitial fibrosis. At 1 mo, the creatinine clearance decreased (control 0.66 versus BEA 0.33 ml/min per 100 g body wt, P = 0.02), and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio increased markedly (control 0.19 versus BEA 0.51, P = 0.02). In a group of animals given the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (Enal; 100 mg/L) in their drinking water for 4 wk, beginning 1 wk before BEA injection, creatinine clearance improved significantly (BEA 0.33 versus Enal + BEA 0.52 ml/min per 100 g body wt, P = 0.01) and albumin excretion fell to zero. Histologic examination revealed an 88% decrease in the area of papillary necrosis and a decrease in the degree of interstitial fibrosis in the corticomedullary junction. To determine whether this was due to changes in urine flow rate induced by enalapril, a group of animals was injected with BEA, and enalapril at the above dose was begun 1 wk later. After 1 mo, the enalapril-treated animals showed the same improvement in creatinine clearance (BEA 0.33 versus BEA + Enal 0.50 ml/min per 100 g body wt, P = 0.03) and suppression of albumin excretion. The area of papillary necrosis was reduced by 67%. In the BEA animals treated with enalapril, ED-1-positive cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and transforming growth factor-beta1 were decreased compared with BEA alone. It is concluded that in this model of papillary necrosis, enalapril protects renal function and decreases interstitial fibrosis mediated at least in part through an angiotensin II/bradykinin-dependent mechanism.", 
    "502": "The application of mechanical strain leads to activation of human brain natriuretic peptide gene promoter activity, a marker of hypertrophy, in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. We have used a combination of transient transfection analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to examine the role of locally produced factors in contributing to this activation. Conditioned media from strained, but not static, cultures led to a dose-dependent increase in human brain natriuretic peptide gene promoter activity. This increase was completely blocked by losartan or BQ-123, implying a role for angiotensin and endothelin as autocrine/paracrine mediators of the response to strain. Inclusion of the same antagonists in the cultures themselves led to only partial inhibition (approximately 60%), whereas inclusion of exogenous endothelin or angiotensin II resulted in amplification of the strain response. Angiotensin II and endothelin appear to be arrayed in series in the regulatory circuitry; the angiotensin response was blocked by BQ-123, whereas the endothelin response was unaffected by losartan. Mechanical strain was also shown to stimulate expression of the endogenous angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and endothelin genes in this system. Collectively, these data indicate that locally generated angiotensin II and endothelin, acting in series, play an important autocrine/paracrine role in mediating strain-dependent activation of cardiac-specific gene expression.", 
    "503": "The mechanism underlying the action of Indian red scorpion (Buthus tamulus; BT) venom on cardiac reflexes was examined in urethane anaesthetized adult albino rats of either sex. Intravenous injection of phenyldiguanide (PDG) produced reflex hypotension, bradycardia and apnea lasting for > 60 s. The PDG-induced reflex responses (blood pressure, heart rate and respiration) were augmented greatly (magnitude and time period) after exposure to BT venom (100 microg/kg, i.v., for 30 min). However, there were no great alterations in resting blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. Pretreatment with kallikrein kinin inhibitor (aprotinin; 6000 kallikrein inactivating unit, i.v.) blocked the BT venom-induced augmentation of PDG reflex response. Further, pretreatment with indomethacin (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor; 10 mg/kg) and heparin (1000 units/kg) also blocked the venom-induced potentiation of the reflex. Captopril (15 mg/kg), an agent known to increase endogenous kinins, also augmented the PDG induced-reflex to the same extent as in BT envenomed rats. The captopril-induced augmentation of the reflex was blocked by aprotinin and heparin, but not by indomethacin. The results indicate that kinins and prostaglandins are involved in the BT venom-induced augmentation of the cardiac reflexes.",

    "505": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a heterogeneous group of agents, and important pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and therapeutic differences among them must be understood to obtain optimal therapy. For patients with severe liver disease, lisinopril and captopril are not prodrugs (e.g., do not require hepatic activation), and lisinopril has almost solely renal elimination. Enalaprilat, the intravenous formulation of enalapril, is the only intravenously available ACE inhibitor and can be given to patients with severe liver dysfunction as it is also not a prodrug. Fosinopril is the only drug with compensatory dual routes of elimination, and it does not require dosage adjustment in patients with reduced renal function, as other ACE inhibitors do. Captopril and moexipril have potential drug-food interactions and are the only agents that should be spaced from meals. The ACE inhibitors also differ in their dialyzability, half-life, lipophilicity, trough:peak ratios, approved indications, and therapeutic information available for many indications.",

    "507": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used in several clinical trials to slow a progressive decline in glomerular function in patients with diabetic nephropathy independent of their effects on blood pressure. The purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanisms(s) through which an ACE inhibitor, captopril, exerts its protective effect on renal function using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Male SHRs were made diabetic by intravenous injection of STZ (45 mg/kg). One hundred or 25 mg/kg of captopril was administered daily for 4 weeks to them. Urine albumin excretion (UAE) rate was markedly increased in diabetic SHRs, while captopril treatment resulted in a significant suppression of UAE in diabetic SHRs, independent of both its daily dose and effects on blood pressure as well as glycemic control. Examination by electron microscope revealed that the number of anionic sites (AS) in the lamina rara externa per 1000 nm of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) was significantly decreased (22.9+/-0.2 to 16.1+/-0.3, p < 0.001), after induction of diabetes, whereas, significant recovery (18.2+/-0.1, p < 0.001) could be obtained even by the smaller dose (25 mg/kg) of captopril which did not exert either antihypertensive or antidiabetic effect on diabetic SHRs. Thus, we demonstrate here the direct evidence that captopril, an ACE inhibitor, can protect against damage on GBM of diabetic SHR without controlling blood pressure as well as blood glucose level.", 
    "508": "Moexipril is a prodrug which is hydrolysed after oral administration to its active metabolite moexiprilat, an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Once daily administration of moexipril 7.5 or 15 mg effectively reduces blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension (including the elderly and postmenopausal women with this condition). In double-blind randomised comparative studies, moexipril 7.5 to 15 mg once daily showed similar efficacy to other antihypertensive agents, including captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol, sustained release verapamil and nitrendipine. Combined therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and moexipril had a significantly greater antihypertensive effect than either agent alone. Moexipril is well tolerated by the majority of patients and compares well in this respect with other antihypertensive agents. Its tolerability profile appears to be characteristic of ACE inhibitors as a class (the most common adverse events being headache, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and cough). Moexipril generally had no clinically significant effect on lipid, glucose or electrolyte metabolism or haematological parameters, and, in particular, it was not associated with any significant changes in lipid or glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women (with or without hormone replacement therapy).",

    "510": "The use of digitalis in congestive heart failure with normal sinus rhythm is still debated. While older uncontrolled, withdrawal studies from 1969 to 1983 provided incomplete data, with poorly documented clinical status and poor haemodynamic and exercise data, some patients did improve clinically when digitalis treatment was utilised. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials from 1977 to 1991 were of better quality but still short in duration, with small sample sizes and still with incomplete haemodynamic and exercise data. In 1993, the Prospective Randomised Study of Ventricular Failure and Efficacy of Digoxin (PROVED) and Randomised Assessment of Digoxin on Inhibitors of the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (RADIANCE) study, followed in 1997 by the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial, documented that digoxin prevents clinical deterioration and hospitalisations, and improves exercise tolerance and left ventricular function, but has no effect on survival. A substudy of the DIG trial showed no detrimental effect of digoxin on survival in patients with ejection fraction (EF) of > 45%, i.e. left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, digoxin appears to be the first inotrope with no detrimental effect on survival in heart failure. In addition, the neurohormonal effect of digoxin has been documented, and is possibly present with dosages even lower than 0.25 mg. Finally, it has been determined that patients with only mild heart failure do obtain documented benefit from administration of this drug.",

In addition, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has helped to achieve new information on the optimal blood pressure target to be reached in order to protect the residual renal function maximally.",

Two conditions seen very early in radioimmunoassay (ROP) are vasoconstriction and vaso-obliteration. A potent vasoconstrictor secreted by endothelial cells is endothelin-1 (ET-1).

We speculate that ET-1 may be involved in retinal vessel vasoconstriction seen early in the development of ROP. Further, ACE inhibitors and calcium-channel blocking agents, such as captopril and nifedipine, may provide an avenue for blocking vasoconstriction in ROP.",

The analysis was differential and was conducted from a payer perspective in a French setting. Costs were computed from individual data related to the use of resources during the TRACE trial. For drug treatments, we chose French public prices, and for hospitalisations, we used the mean cost as determined by the diagnosis related group (DRG) from the 1996 Programme de M\u00e9dicalisation des Syst\u00e9mes d'Information (PMSI) database from the French Ministry of Health. Life expectancy was estimated through an accelerated failure-time model with an exponential distribution specification; we made the conservative hypothesis that the effect of trandolapril on mortality after the end of the trial was nil.

    "531": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the prevention of stroke with perindopril treatment in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) is associated with the preservation of the myogenic properties of the cerebral arteries. After weaning at 4 weeks of age, male SHRSP were fed a Japanese-style rat diet with high salt to induce stroke development. Treatment with perindopril was given by gavage every morning beginning at 6 weeks of age. There were three experimental groups: two groups treated with 4 mg.kg-1.day-1 perindopril for different durations (8 or 12 weeks) and one control group consisting of littermates given distilled water. All the control animals developed stroke and died within 14 weeks of age, and myogenic response of the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) to pressure increase was lost in these animals. In contrast, all the treated SHRSP survived during the treatment period, and myogenic response of the MCA was preserved. After withdrawal of the treatment, SHRSP treated for a longer period (12 weeks) also survived longer than those treated for a shorter period (8 weeks). The subsequent development of stroke and death following treatment withdrawal after 8 or 12 weeks of treatment was associated with the loss of pressure-dependent constriction in MCA. A longer treatment duration also increased the stiffness of the MCA, MCA from SHRSP after 12 weeks of treatment had smaller external and lumen diameters, and thicker walls than those from the 8-week treatment group. In a separate study, we found that treatment of SHRSP with 1 or 4 mg.kg-1.day-1 of perindopril for 24 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of age also protected them against death related to stroke, because these rats survived up to 43 weeks of age, when the experiment was terminated. We conclude that there is an association between the absence of myogenic response in cerebral arteries and stroke development in SHRSP. Perindopril treatment preserves the myogenic response of MCA in SHRSP and prevents the stroke development in these animals. A prolonged treatment could increase the survival of SHRSP through a remodelling of the MCA and increasing the stiffness of the cerebral arteries.",

Dissected arterial vessels were mounted on a wire myograph for measurement of morphology and isometric tension. Morphology was not different in arteries from the three groups. Responses to norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and electrical field stimulation were similar in arteries from placebo-treated patients with mild heart failure and control subjects. Similarly, endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation was normal in arteries from patients with mild heart failure. Ramipril therapy was associated with functional alterations: vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine and angiotensin II were significantly enhanced compared with placebo (P < 0.001). These data suggest that vascular structure and function are not different in vitro in subcutaneous arteries from placebo-treated patients with mild heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy is associated with enhanced vasoconstriction to norepinephrine and angiotensin II, which may reflect upregulation of receptor-mediated events.",

In vitro, the combination showed neither agonistic nor antagonistic activities on the isolated guinea pig trachea in concentrations up to 2 x 10(-4) g/ml. In mice, there was no effect on intestinal motility or the thiopental-induced sleeping time up to 1000 mg/kg. The only activity observed in mice was an inhibition of spontaneous motility after oral dosing with 300 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively. Both HCTZ (1-10 mg/kg) alone and the combination moexipril/HCTZ (1.6 or 4.8 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in diuresis and electrolyte excretion in rats, however, without any potentiating effects for the drug combination. On the cardiovascular system of anaesthetised dogs, the effects observed were as expected, e.g. dose-related decrease in blood pressure. Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed the kidney as target organ. This effect, based on highly exaggerated pharmacological activity, is well-known for other ACE inhibitors. No potential for teratogenic effects could be observed for the drug combination. In summary, the preclinical data indicate that the combination of moexipril and HCTZ (ratio 7.5 + 12.5) represents a safe drug without relevant side effects or gross toxicity.", 
    "551": "The use of heart rate in clinical practice is limited by its variability under measurement situations. The mean heart rate on ambulatory monitoring provides a more robust statistic for clinical use. We examined the relationship between mean heart rate on initial referral ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to the BP-lowering efficacy of the four main groups of anti-hypertensive medications, in a referral hypertensive population. Patients were retrospectively identified by review of the BP database, and data collected from the initial referral BP monitor off medication, and the subsequent ABPM after treatment with either beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The change in mean arterial BP from the initial to the subsequent ABPM (ie, as a result of treatment) was correlated with the mean heart rate on the initial ABPM. A moderate association was found for initial daytime heart rate and BP response to beta-blockers (r = 0.24, P = 0.02), and ACE inhibitors (r = 0.14, P = 0.05). No such association was found for calcium antagonists or diuretics. When the groups were divided into those with a mean daytime heart rate <75 and > or =75 beats per min, BP reduction from beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy was significantly greater in those patients with a higher daytime heart rate. We conclude that average daytime heart rate on pre-treatment ABPM can be useful as a predictor of BP response to beta-blockade or ACE inhibition.",

In the present study, we examined effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on cardiac hypertrophy and renal disorders using Tsukuba hypertensive mice. While THM showed an increase of about 30 mmHg in systolic pressure compared to C57BL/6 mice employed as normal control animals, the increase in blood pressure was not observed in the mice to which either gene was transferred. Urinary volume, water intake volume, urinary albumin excretion, heart to body weight ratio and renal glomerular sclerosis index increased significantly in THM, but none of these parameters showed a significant difference from the C57 mice when they were examined in mice to which either of the genes was transferred. In contrast, when lisinopril was administered to THM, all the parameters decreased significantly without lowering the systolic pressure. From these findings, it was demonstrated that RAS was playing a significant role in cardiac hypertrophy and renal disorders of THM and that lisinopril had inhibitory effects on cardiac hypertrophy and renal glomerular sclerosis by inhibiting RAS.",

After 6 months of treatment the hINR number increased in Group A (5.73+/-1.47 v 7.5+/-2.06, P < .001) and remained unchanged (5.35+/-1.09 v 5.5+/-1.31, P = NS) in Group B. Thus, hINR number is decreased in hypertension and, in contrast to atenolol, fosinopril treatment is associated with an increase in hINR number, suggesting a favorable effect on glucose metabolism.", 
    "554": "In developing countries, the cost of antihypertensive medications is one of the principal limiting factors when trying to treat patients with high blood pressure. To determine the changes in cost (in US dollars) of these medications and in the percentage of the minimum wage needed to purchase them, two cost studies (1990 and 1996) done in Mexico were compared. The yearly cost of a treatment with hydrochlorothiazide was US $13.80 in 1990; in 1996 it was US $10.92. Both figures represent 1.1% of the minimum wage that was in effect at the time. Propranolol hydrochloride cost US $50.52 for a year's treatment in 1990, and US $66.12 for the same in 1996. These figures represented, respectively, 4.2% and 6.7% of the minimum wage of 1990 and 1996. The annual cost for nifedipine was US $176.76 in 1990 (14.7% of the minimum wage) and US $242.16 in 1996 (24.8% of the minimum wage). The yearly cost of enalapril was US $233.04 in 1990 and US $433.20 in 1996; these costs represented, respectively, 19.4% and 44.2% of the minimum wage. The comparison of these two cost studies (1990 and 1996) shows why Mexico's population is finding it more difficult to purchase antihypertensive medications. Higher costs and reduced purchasing power seem to be the two principal factors causing this. This is probably affecting the population's health, as it is more difficult to control high blood pressure without proper treatment.", 
    "555": "Diuretic-based therapy is less effective in reducing the cardiac complications of hypertension than the risk of stroke and may be less effective in reducing left ventricular (LV) mass than is therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In view of the strong association of LV hypertrophy with cardiovascular risk, this study was designed to compare the impact of therapy with a diuretic and ACE inhibition on cardiac and vascular structure. Fifty essential hypertensives (74% male, 88% nonwhite) participated in a double-blind study for 6 months and were randomized to either ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after initiation of therapy. The 22 ramipril patients were comparable to the 28 HCTZ patients at baseline in age, race, and 24-h BP. Although HCTZ resulted in a greater reduction in 24-h BP, only treatment with ramipril resulted in a decrease in LV mass (193 to 179 g, P < .005, v 184 to 182 g, P = NS), attributable to a reduction in wall thicknesses but not in chamber diameter. In multivariate analysis, both change in BP and treatment group were independent predictors of change in LV mass. Importantly, although neither drug reduced carotid artery cross-sectional area, relative wall thickness increased due to a tendency for vessel diameter to decrease and wall thickness to increase, particularly in the diuretic group. Ramipril caused a sustained fall in plasma angiotensin II, whereas HCTZ increased angiotensin II levels. Although diuretic therapy was more effective in lowering ambulatory BP in this predominantly nonwhite population, only therapy with ACE inhibition was associated with regression of LV mass. Vascular geometry was altered consistent with the reduction in distending pressure resulting in vascular remodelling.", 
    "556": "Endothelin, a 21-amino-acid peptide, binds to a specific receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inducing vasoconstriction. Although plasma levels are not consistently elevated in hypertension, there is evidence that endothelin has an important role in its pathogenesis. Administration of endothelin antagonists has lowered blood pressure and reduced end-organ damage in some animal models. It has also reduced the cross-sectional area of neointima due both to hypertension and vascular injury. Coadministration of endothelin and angiotensin II to rats produced a synergistic hypertensive effect. Similarly, coadministration of an endothelin antagonist with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor resulted in a synergistic lowering of blood pressure. Several preliminary clinical studies have been done. The endothelin antagonist bosentan has decreased vascular resistance and blood pressure and increased cardiac index in patients with congestive heart failure. Plasma endothelin levels are elevated in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and in chronic heart failure. The magnitude of this increase, measured 3 days after patients experienced myocardial infarction, had a significance at least equal to known risk factors in predicting 1 year survival. Thus, there are reasons to believe that endothelin antagonists may become a useful tool in the management of various cardiovascular disorders.",

    "564": "In patients with proteinuric renal diseases the rate of progression of renal insufficiency is determined by the level of blood pressure and proteinuria. It has been demonstrated that strict blood pressure control with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors or beta-blockers, aimed at reaching values below 130/80 mm Hg, attenuates the deterioration of renal function. In general, the beneficial effects of these drugs are reflected in a parallel lowering of proteinuria. Calcium channel blockers are effective antihypertensive drugs, however, their safety in patients with proteinuric renal diseases and renal insufficiency may be questioned because of reported untoward effects on urinary protein excretion. The present review discusses the potential benefits and risks of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the treatment of patients with renal diseases. To this end we have evaluated the effects of these drugs in animal models of progressive renal injury. In these animal models adverse effects of CCBs have been reported which are attributed to an impairment of autoregulation. In patients with proteinuria, the dihydropyridine CCBs do not lower proteinuria despite a reduction of blood pressure. Studies on the effects on the course of renal function are limited, however, the available data do suggest that this class of CCBs may be less advantageous than other antihypertensive drugs, thus arguing against the use of these agents as first-line drugs in patients with proteinuric renal diseases. Information on the effects of the non-dihydropyridine CCBs is limited to a small number of studies in patients with diabetic renal disease. Although the data suggest that these classes of CCBs might be more beneficial, more studies are needed, particularly in patients with non-diabetic renal diseases, before founded conclusions can be reached.",

At 1 day after MI, the animals were randomly assigned to cilazapril treatment or no treatment. We performed Doppler-echocardiographic examinations and measured cardiac mRNA in rats at 1 month and 3 months after MI (each group n = 8). The weights of the right (RV) and left ventricles (LV) in 1- and 3-month MI rats were significantly larger than those of the control rats. Cilazapril significantly prevented the increase. The MI rats showed systolic dysfunction, as evidenced by decreased fractional shortening (control, 34 +/- 3% vs. MI, 17 +/- 3%; P < 0.01) and ejection fraction measured by the modified Simpson's method (control, 61 +/- 2% vs. MI, 36 +/- 3%; P < 0.01) in rats at 1 month after operation. MI rats showed diastolic dysfunction, defined as increased peak early filling velocity, increased deceleration rate of the early filling wave, decreased late filling velocity, and an increase in the ratio of early filling to late filling velocity. Cilazapril significantly prevented systolic and diastolic dysfunction in rats after MI. The increases in beta-MHC, alpha-skeletal actin, ANP, and collagen I and III mRNAs in the nonischemic LV and RV were significantly suppressed by treatment with cilazapril. Depressed SR Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA (nonischemic LV, 0.7-fold, P < 0.05 vs. control; RV, 0.5-fold, P < 0.05 vs. control) at 3 months after MI was significantly restored to normal levels by cilazapril. Cilazapril improved the adverse remodeling process by attenuating the progression of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and prevented abnormal cardiac gene expression following MI.", 
    "566": "The nephrotic mouse (ICGN strain) is a useful model for progressive nephrotic syndrome (NS). In the present study, we demonstrated the preventive effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the progression of renal dysfunction and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis in the NS mice. Administration of enalapril (5 mg/dL in drinking water) to the 4-week-old NS mice for a 4-week-period did not improve their nephrotic symptoms such as albuminuria and hypoalbuminemia, but significantly suppressed the increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Renal histopathology demonstrated that the administration of the ACE inhibitor significantly attenuated the progression of the tubular and interstitial lesions (tubular dilatation, luminal cast accumulation and interstitial expansion) rather than the glomerular sclerotic changes. The suppression of the increase in blood urea nitrogen level by enalapril depended on the attenuated tubular injury rather than on the unchanged glomerular matrix deposition. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the administration of the ACE inhibitor suppressed the formation of myofibroblasts, identified by the alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, in the interstitial spaces. Consequently, interstitial matrix deposition was significantly reduced in the NS mice treated with enalapril. From the results obtained with the spontaneous nephrotic model, we emphasize a possibility that ACE inhibitor may be effective for attenuating progression of renal dysfunction and fibrosis in human NS, even if the ACE inhibitor fails to improve nephrotic symptoms such as albuminuria and hypoalbuminemia.", 
    "567": "Antihypertensive therapy has been shown to slow down the progression of chronic renal failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists have been emphasized as the agents with the most protective effect. Our previous study showed that captopril slowed down renal function deterioration in the early course of adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The present study was undertaken with the aim to examine morphologic changes associated with that slower renal function deterioration. Adult (24 weeks) female SHR were randomly divided into the following groups: the control group (n = 12) was given tap water to drink; the adriamycin (ADR) group (n = 25) was treated with ADR; the ADR-captopril (ADR-C) group (n = 27) was treated with ADR and thereafter with captopril (60 mg/kg/day). Rats were sacrificed at weeks 6, 12 and 18 and histologic analysis was semiquantitatively performed. In the control group the glomeruli exhibited only minor changes at the end of the study. In the ADR group slight glomerular mesangial hypercellularity appeared in the sixth week and progressed in focal and segmental sclerosis. Some glomeruli showed segmental proliferation and increased fibrular matrix of a tuft adherent to a fibrocellular crescents. In the ADR-C group, glomeruli with a slight increase of mesangial matrix were seen at the end of the sixth week, mesangial hypercellularity developed until the end of the sixth week, mesangial hypercellularity developed until the end of the 12th week and segmental glomerulosclerosis until the end of the study. Semiquantitative analysis revealed that the mean semiquantitative scores for mesangial expansion and glomerular sclerosis were significantly lower in ADR-C group than in ADR group throughout the study. We concluded that captopril slowed down mesangial expansion and reduced the development of glomerular sclerosis.", 
    "568": "Evidence from clinical trials in the past decade has consistently shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The extent to which clinical practice has adopted ACE inhibitor therapy is unknown.", 
    "569": "The Cardiovascular Health Study is a prospective observational study of 5201 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older. Prevalent CHF cases were identified on study entry (from June 10, 1989, through May 31, 1990) and incident CHF cases were identified throughout 5 years of follow-up. Medication data were collected from annual medication inventories. The percentage of patients with CHF using ACE inhibitors was calculated at each annual examination. Temporal trends in CHF treatment with ACE inhibitors between June 10, 1989, through May 31, 1990, and June 1, 1994, through May 31, 1995, were analyzed.", 
    "570": "Use of ACE inhibitors to treat CHF increased slightly over time among prevalent cases at each annual examination: 26% of prevalent CHF cases were treated in 1989-1990 compared with 36% of prevalent cases in 1994-1995. This 10% increase was statistically significant (P<.01). Participants with low ejection fractions were 2 times more likely to be treated with ACE inhibitors than were those with normal ejection fraction and this tendency did not change over time. Among cases newly diagnosed in the year before the 1990-1991 examination, 42% were using ACE inhibitors; among those newly diagnosed in the year before 1994-1995, 40% were using ACE inhibitors. This 2% decrease was not statistically significant (P=.68).", 
    "571": "These findings suggest that, while the medical management of CHF with ACE inhibitors has increased modestly over time in prevalent cases, these drugs may still be underused, especially among incident cases.", 
    "572": "Diabetes is a devastating disease with multiple adverse effects on the vasculature. Moreover, hypertension is a prerequisite for patients with diabetes to progress to end-stage renal disease and to develop cardiovascular complications. Adequate control of blood glucose and blood pressure are the two most important factors that predict a favorable renal outcome. Recent studies have also shown that some classes of antihypertensive medications, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may be ideal initial agents to control blood pressure in the hypertensive diabetic patient and thus to preserve renal function. In addition, nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers have been shown to retard the decline in renal function in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) nephropathy who have lost at least 50% of their renal function. Retrospective analyses demonstrate that a reduction in blood pressure, especially to levels of <130/85 mg Hg in diabetic patients, retards the progression of renal disease. Reduction in arterial pressure to these low levels is probably more important than the agents used to achieve this goal. Because many of these patients require more than one medication to achieve these lower levels of arterial pressure, it is clear that fixed-dose combinations of such agents will both improve the likelihood of achieving a given blood pressure goal as well as medication compliance.", 
    "573": "Although prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the main goals of antihypertensive therapy, when first seen hypertensive patients often have associated CAD. These patients need a therapy that can exert an acute anti-ischemic action, such as ad hoc relief of angina pectoris, and can also reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) or reinfarction. Reduction in blood pressure (BP) alone does not appear to be adequate because in hypertensive patients CAD is a complex and multifactorial process involving not only hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and metabolic factors but also hypertension-induced myocardial and vascular structural changes, which appear independently to contribute to risk for CAD. In theory, antihypertensive combination therapy, by summing the different effects of various drugs, appears to have a greater capacity for comprehensive management of hypertensive patients with CAD. Simultaneous administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers appears to be particularly effective. In several clinical trials with long-term follow-up, ACE inhibitor therapy has been associated with a substantial reduction in the risk for major ischemic events. The antiproliferative action of ACE inhibitors on myocardium and the vascular wall, their hemodynamic effects, antiatherogenic actions, neurohormonal attenuation, and certain genetic issues may account for the ability of this class of drugs to reduce the risk for CAD-related events. Although ACE inhibitors can be expected to increase coronary blood flow when the renin-angiotensin system is activated and to reduce BP, ventricular filling pressure, and sympathetic drive, thus far an acute anti-ischemic action of these drugs has not been demonstrated. Unlike ACE inhibitors, which usually have class-specific effects, there are important differences in the clinical effects of various calcium antagonists. The first generation of dihydropyridine calcium-entry blockers has failed to demonstrate efficacy in secondary prevention of coronary artery events. However, verapamil reduces mortality in patients with normal left ventricular function. The antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil, its antiatherogenic action, and its ability to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy, to improve diastolic function, and to interfere with endothelium-derived contracting factors may also account for the improved survival of patients with CAD treated with this drug. Moreover, verapamil is also effective in the treatment of all types of angina because it reduces myocardial oxygen consumption as a result of its hypotensive effect and its ability to reduce heart rate, and it may also improve oxygen delivery to the myocardium because of its action on coronary vasodilatation. It is also important to consider that ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists often induce the same beneficial effects through different mechanisms, thus allowing a synergistic action when the two classes of drugs are administered together.", 
    "574": "An increasing body of evidence indicates that impairment of endothelial function is crucially involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Injury to the endothelium precipitates atherosclerosis by causing smooth-muscle cell migration and proliferation, induction of expression of growth factors, and impairment of plasma coagulation and endogenous fibrinolysis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists are widely used in patients with cardiovascular disease and have beneficial vascular effects beyond blood pressure control alone. Both exhibit a synergistic hemodynamic profile. Whereas calcium antagonists dilate large conduit and resistance arteries, ACE inhibitors inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and reduce sympathetic outflow. Certain calcium antagonists, such as verapamil and diltiazem, reduce heart rate, whereas dihydropyridines tend to increase it. In the blood vessel wall, the local vascular effects of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are complementary. ACE inhibitors diminish transformation of angiotensin I (Ang I) into angiotensin II (Ang II) and prevent degradation of bradykinin [which stimulates nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin formation]. Calcium antagonists inhibit the effects of Ang I and endothelin-1 (ET-1) at the level of vascular smooth muscle by reducing Ca2+ inflow and facilitating the vasodilator effects of NO. The resistance circulation is particularly dependent on extracellular Ca2+, thereby explaining why nifedipine and verapamil effectively inhibit ET-induced vasoconstriction in vitro and in vivo. In hypertension, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists markedly improve structural changes and increase the media/lumen ratio in resistance arteries. Long-term combination therapy with verapamil and trandolapril is particularly effective in reversing endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive animals. ACE inhibitors substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI). There is a strong trend indicating benefit with verapamil as well, but this is confined to patients with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Clinical studies have confirmed that calcium antagonists exhibit antiatherogenic properties. However, the clinical relevance of these findings has recently been disputed because short-acting dihydropyridines are reported to increase risk for MI. Because ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists exhibit synergistic hemodynamic, antiproliferative, antithrombotic, and antiatherogenic properties, combination therapy provides a promising concept in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease.", 
    "575": "There are conflicting reports on the interaction of aspirin with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure and systemic hypertension. A post hoc analysis of the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS) study was conducted. At randomization, 94 patients (31.5%) took aspirin. In patients who took aspirin, the cumulative alpha-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase release was 1,151 +/- 132 IU/L in patients randomized to captopril compared with 1,401 +/- 136 IU/L in patients randomized to placebo (difference -250 +/- 189 [95% confidence interval (CI) -620 to 120]). This difference was comparable to the difference in patients who did not use aspirin (-199 +/- 147 [95% CI -488 to 897]). One year after acute myocardial infarction, an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index of 2.2 +/- 3.0 ml/m2 in captopril-treated and 1.9 +/- 2.9 ml/m2 in placebo-treated patients was observed in patients who took aspirin (difference 0.4 +/- 4.2 [95% CI -8.2 to 8.9]). This difference was also comparable to the difference in patients who did not take aspirin (2.2 +/- 3.8 [95% CI -5.2 to 9.7]). One year after acute myocardial infarction, patients who did take aspirin had a mean change in LV end-diastolic volume index of 2.1 +/- 2.1 ml/m2 compared with 8.4 +/- 1.9 ml/m2 in patients who did not use aspirin (p = 0.02). Thus, aspirin does not attenuate the acute and long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after acute myocardial infarction, but independently reduces LV dilation after myocardial infarction.", 
    "576": "In the present study we analyzed structural characteristics of muscular pulmonary arteries and arterioles in two classic models of pulmonary hypertension, the rat hypoxia and monocrotaline models. We hypothesized that an increase in medial cross-sectional area would result in reduction of the lumen area and that these parameters would correlate with the increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Four weeks after a single injection of monocrotaline (MCT) or after 4 wk of hypoxic exposure the rats were killed. Both MCT and chronic hypoxia induced right ventricular hypertrophy. In separate groups of rats both MCT and chronic hypoxia increased PAP. MCT increased the media cross-sectional area of pulmonary arteries with an external diameter between 30-100 microm and 101-200 microm and reduced the lumen area of pulmonary arteries with an external diameter between 101-200 microm. Chronic hypoxia only slightly increased the media cross-sectional area without a change of the lumen area. Both MCT and hypoxia increased the percentage of partly muscularized and muscularized arterioles. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (0.5 mg/kg/h) had no effect on MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary artery remodeling. In chronic hypoxic rats it prevented an increase in medial cross-sectional area of pulmonary arteries with an external diameter between 30-100 microm and attenuated the increase in the percentage of muscularized arterioles, without any effect on the PAP. We conclude that MCT, in contrast to chronic hypoxia, induces structural changes of muscular pulmonary arteries with an external diameter between 101-200 microm which may contribute to an increased PAP and right ventricular hypertrophy. These data also suggest that angiotensin II plays a pivotal role in remodeling of pulmonary arteries in hypoxia but not in MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "577": "This study was conducted to examine whether imidaprilat, an active diacid of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril, preferentially inhibits angiotensin I degradation rather than bradykinin degradation, and whether imidapril is less active than other ACE inhibitors in inducing cough in patients with hypertension. The effect of imidaprilat on the inhibition of pressor response to angiotensin I and augmentation of depressor response to bradykinin was compared with that of enalaprilat and captopril in anesthetized rats. To determine the incidence of cough associated with imidapril, patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced dry cough were enrolled in a randomized, open-labeled, crossover trial with two 6-week periods to be treated with imidapril or amlodipine, a calcium-channel blocker. The recurrence of cough was assessed during both treatments. In the animal study, there were no significant differences in the ratio of inhibition of pressor response to angiotensin I and the augmentation of depressor response to bradykinin among the ACE inhibitors. In the cough-challenge trial, a total of 60 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the study. Cough and cough related symptoms recurred in 98.3% of the patients (59/ 60) during imidapril therapy. In contrast, only two patients reported cough during treatment with amlodipine. These results indicate that imidapril has no selectivity in inhibiting angiotensin I- and bradykinin-degradation in rats, and that clinically it is not different from other ACE inhibitors in inducing cough in patients with hypertension.", 
    "578": "Several studies on disease and treatment effects on neurohormones have been conducted with small numbers of patients, using one blood sample as representative of their states. The aim of this study was to assess the within-patient variability of plasma concentrations of several hormones and cytokines of recent interest, in patients with moderate heart failure and controlled stable background therapy over 3 weeks. Blood for neurohormone and cytokine assays was sampled in duplicate from 18 patients with moderate heart failure. After an initial visit, the patients were kept on stable therapy until the second blood sampling 21 +/- 3 days later. The plasma concentrations of several neurohormones (endothelin, renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, norepinephrine) and cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-13 (IL-13), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and soluble receptor type I of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, (sTNF-RI) were measured with immunochemical methods. Some cytokines (IL-13, CNTF and LIF) were not detected. Despite clinically satisfactory ACE inhibition, circulating angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were still elevated in some patients, suggesting aldosterone escape. The between-visit agreement of plasma concentrations measured in duplicate was less than 35% for all circulating factors, except renin which showed a higher variability throughout the 3-week study period.", 
    "579": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) treatment was recently shown to activate Jak2, Stat1, and Stat3 proteins in cardiac myocytes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be an effective clinical treatment following myocardial infarction, implying that inhibition of Ang II production is beneficial in this pathological condition. Some of the effects of Ang II in cardiac myocytes may be mediated by the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The AT1 receptor was the first G-protein-coupled-receptor reported to activate the JAK-STAT pathway. Recently, however, another G-protein-coupled-receptor (i.e. serotonin) was also shown to signal through the JaK2 and STAT proteins in myoblasts. We hypothesized that Ang II treatment might also activate Stat5 transcription factors in cardiac myocytes. In this study, we provide evidence that the G-protein-coupled, Ang II type I (AT1) receptor couples to activation of Stat5 through Jak2 kinase in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Angiotensin II induces a 1.5- to 10-fold increase in a Stat5 transcription complex, which binds to the prolactin-inducing element (PIE). By Western analysis, Stat5 protein levels were shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated two- to three-fold over control, following. Ang II treatment of cardiac myocytes. Phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b proteins was rapid and sustained (30-60 min), and Jak2 kinase co-immunoprecipitated with activated Stat5 proteins. In cardiac myocytes, Stat5 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with the AT1 receptor. Selective inhibition of Jak2 kinase with AG-490 blocked formation of prolactin-inducing factor (PIF) complexes by Ang II, suggesting that Jak2 kinase was required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 in cardiac myocytes.", 
    "580": "The aim of the present study was to clarify myocardial collagen metabolism in cardiomyopathic hamsters and the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on collagen synthesis. Cardiac fibroblasts from Bio 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters and from non-cardiomyopathic Flb hamsters were cultured and used in the 4th passage. The synthetic activity of collagenous protein from the two types of hamsters was determined by measuring 3H-proline uptake, and the collagen type was subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Also studied were the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (1 microM) on collagen synthesis by cardiac fibroblasts from cardiomyopathic hamsters. Twenty five-week-old Bio 14.6 hamsters had significantly higher synthetic activity of collagenous protein and rate of collagen synthesis compared with 13-week-old Bio 14.6 hamsters or 25-week-old Flb hamsters [Bio 14.6(25-week); 12.4 +/- 1.6, Bio 14.6(13-week); 4.8 +/- 0.4, Flb (25-week); 8.7 +/- 0.9 cpm/cell, Bio 14.6(25-week); 11.0 +/- 0.9, Bio 14.6(13-week); 3.9 +/- 0.4, F1b (25-week); 4.8 +/- 0.4%, p < 0.05]. Qualitatively, 25-week-old Bio 14.6 hamsters had significantly higher synthetic activity of type I, III, IV and V collagens compared with 25-week-old F1b hamsters. The synthetic activity of type III collagen was increased the most in the cardiomyopathic group. Captopril (1 microM) caused a significant decrease in synthetic activity of collagenous protein in 25-week-old Bio 14.6 hamsters (12.4 +/- 1.6 cpm/cell-->10.9 +/- 1.1 cpm/cell, p < 0.05). Qualitatively, the synthetic activity of type III collagen was decreased to about half. Our study revealed enhanced collagen synthetic activity in cardiac fibroblasts from Bio 14.6 hamsters. Captopril improved collagen metabolism in cultured cardiac fibroblasts from Bio 14.6 hamsters not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. The mechanism of this improvement may be related to the cardiac renin angiotensin system.", 
    "581": "The coronary circulation is controlled by the central nervous system, circulating hormones and local vascular mechanisms. The importance of local regulatory mechanisms has only recently been recognized. The endothelium is in a strategical anatomical position within the blood vessel wall located between the circulating blood and vascular smooth muscle cells. It can respond to mechanical and hormonal signals from the blood; of particular importance is the fact that it is a source of mediators which can modulate the contractile state and proliferative responses of vascular smooth muscle cells, platelet function and coagulation as well as monocyte adhesion. Important relaxing factors are nitric oxide and prostacyclin and a putative hyperpolarizing factor. Nitric oxide also inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and, together with prostacyclin, platelet adhesion and aggregation. Bradykinin-induced nitric oxide production is regulated by angiotensin converting enzyme located on the endothelial cell membrane; indeed, the enzyme not only activates angiotensin I into angiotensin II, but also inactivates bradykinin. Endothelin-1 and thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 are contracting factors produced by the endothelium. In contrast to thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 which activate platelets, endothelin has no direct effects on these cells, but has proliferative properties in vascular smooth muscle. Under physiological conditions, the endothelium plays a protective role as it prevents adhesion of circulating blood cells, keeps the vasculature in a vasodilated state and inhibits vascular smooth muscle proliferation. In disease states, however, endothelial dysfunction contributes to enhanced vasoconstrictor responses, adhesion of platelets and monocytes and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, events all known to occur in coronary artery disease. Nitrates substitute in part for deficient endogenous nitric oxide, while angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increase the bradykinin induced nitric oxide and prostacyclin production. The newly developed endothelin antagonists allow specific blocking of the effects of endothelin. Pharmacological correction of endothelial dysfunction may be important to treat coronary artery disease and its complications.", 
    "582": "Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and with proliferative retinopathy often have a concomitant diabetic nephropathy. However, in cross-sectional studies it has been shown that 35% of patients with proliferative retinopathy do not show signs of diabetic nephropathy. The aim of the present study was to examine the incidence of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy but without signs of nephropathy. To that end, out of 102 consecutive patients with proliferative retinopathy attending the University Hospital, Lund, in 1986, 24 patients did not show any clinical signs of nephropathy, and were followed for 10 years regarding the development of nephropathy. Their age was 36.7 +/- 9.8 years, age at onset 11.8 +/- 7.5 years, diabetes duration 25.7 +/- 6.9 years and duration of proliferative retinopathy 4.6 +/- 3.8 years (mean +/- S.D.). At entry, no patient had albuminuria (< 30 mg/l), and albumin creatinine clearance ratio was < 0.01 x 10(-3). During the 10-year follow-up period, two of the patients showed isolated higher peaks of elevated urinary albumin, but none of the 24 patients developed persistent microalbuminuria (> or = 30 mg/l). Two patients died before follow-up, but none of these had developed microalbuminuria at the time for death. Based on mean annual measurements, there were no increases in HbA1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and serum creatinine levels. At entry, seven of the patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs and another three patients received such treatment during the study period. In conclusion, in a subgroup of patients with proliferative retinopathy, i.e. without clinical signs of diabetic nephropathy, no patient developed persistent microalbuminuria during a 10-year follow-up period. These results indicate further evidence for at least partly different pathogenic mechanisms behind diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy.", 
    "583": "Postmyocardial infarction (MI) survival has been steadily improving. This improvement has been due, in part, to the actions of the adjunctive medical therapies for the treatment of MI. Aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents have been shown to improve survival in the treatment and secondary prevention of MI. Nitrates have beneficial effects as well. These medications complement the reperfusion strategies through different mechanisms. Other adjunctive medical therapies, namely magnesium, antiarrhythmic agents, and calcium-channel blockers, have not been shown to improve mortality with routine post-MI use despite their theoretical benefits.", 
    "584": "1. In six intact and nine carotid sinus denervated (CSD) fetal sheep (125-128 days gestation) we measured heart rate (FHR), mean systemic arterial blood pressure (MAP), femoral and carotid blood flows (FBF and CBF), and femoral and carotid vascular resistances (FVR and CVR). Three experiments were conducted on successive days: normoxia followed by acute isocapnic hypoxia (Pa,O2 to ca 12 mmHg) with infusion of vehicle (HV experiment), the same protocol but with infusion of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (HC experiment), and normoxia alone with captopril infusion (NC experiment). Plasma angiotensin II concentration ([AII]) was measured in these fetuses, and in a separate group of fetuses (n = 5) that were infused with the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor N G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or saline vehicle. 2. During normoxia, cardiovascular parameters and plasma [AII] were unaltered by captopril infusion, apart from a fall in MAP (NC experiment only, P < 0.05) and FHR (HC experiment only, P < 0.05) in intact and CSD fetuses, respectively. No differences were observed between intact and CSD groups. 3. At the onset of hypoxia the rapid initial fall in FHR and rise in FVR was attenuated in CSD fetuses. In all fetuses FHR returned towards prehypoxic levels as hypoxia continued. In contrast, during hypoxia with vehicle infusion (HV experiment) plasma [AII] rose to a similar level in intact and CSD fetuses. 4. In both intact and CSD fetuses, the rise in [AII] during hypoxia was blocked by captopril or L-NAME infusion. In CSD, but not intact, fetuses infused with captopril the rise in MAP was absent, and the fall in FBF and rise in FVR did not reach significance during hypoxia. 5. Thus, during normoxia CSD alone, or combined with ACE inhibition, does not consistently alter basal cardiovascular control in the late gestation fetus. The rise in [AII] during hypoxia is not mediated by carotid reflexes but may involve NO-dependent mechanisms. In intact fetuses, AII does not appear to be pivotal in cardiovascular control during hypoxia. It is only when carotid reflex mechanisms are removed that a role for AII in the regulation of MAP and peripheral blood flow during hypoxia becomes apparent. These findings lend weight to the idea of multiple mechanisms of fetal cardiovascular control during hypoxia.", 
    "585": "Diagnosis of inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy relies on the histological and immunohistological examination of endomyocardial biopsies. Only with the demonstration of the etiological agents in the myocardium specific therapy can be attempted. Whereas the spontaneous course of endemic myocarditis with little hemodynamic impairment is fair, the prognosis of symptomatic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy is poor, with complete restitution in 35% and a 10-year survival rate of 30%. Restriction of physical activity is a validated form of therapy with normalization of the heart size in 40 to 60%. Symptomatic medical therapy consists of digitalis, diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and vasodilators and betablocker therapy, where a reduction of mortality was demonstrated in clinical (sub)studies up to 60%. Specific forms of therapy in inflammatory cardiomyopathy rely on the demonstration or lack of viral persistence or signs of autoreactivity in the myocardial tissue. Immunosuppressive therapy in autoimmune forms improved cardiac function in up to 60% of the patients in controlled trials, when compared to controls (40%). The double-blind randomized myocarditis treatment trial, which unfortunately did not distinguish viral from autoimmune myocarditis could not demonstrate such a benefit, however. Depending on the etiology of the disease, immunomodulation with immunoglobulins or interferon or antiviral therapy with hyperimmunoglobulins are presently tested in clinical treatment trials (ESETCID) in patients with enterovirus-positive or cytomegalovirus-positive and adenovirus-positive chronic myocarditis. Specific therapies are aimed to avoid the progression of the disease which may ultimately lead to heart failure with a cardiac assist device or heart transplantation as ultimate therapeutic option.",

    "594": "In the kidney, aging is characterized by the development of structural changes, including glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is known to play a critical role in the genesis of these alterations in pathologic conditions. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that TGF-beta1 may be involved in the development of age-related histopathologic changes in rat kidney, and that captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, may influence the progression of glomerular and interstitial lesions. In this study, 3-, 18-, 24-, and 30-mo-old rats were examined, and an age-related increase in urinary protein excretion was found; plasma creatinine and systolic BP did not change. Significant structural changes, including glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, were found in the group of aged rats (24- and 30-mo-old). Immunostaining for TGF-beta in the renal cortex interstitium was increased in the group of 24-mo-old rats, with a parallel increase in TGF-beta1 mRNA expression, measured with reverse-transcription PCR. Captopril-treated animals showed a statistically significant decrease in urinary protein excretion but no significant changes in BP. Moreover, captopril reduced the extent of interstitial fibrosis, but did not affect the degree of glomerulosclerosis. A significant inhibition of TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was observed in the captopril-treated animals. These findings suggest that TGF-beta1 may act as a fibrogenic growth factor that could be responsible, at least partially, for the renal interstitial fibrosis associated with aging. Treatment with captopril might delay the progression of these lesions.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (11% vs 42%; p < 0.001), diuretics (30% vs 49%; p = 0.002) and aspirin (44% vs 76%; p = 0.0001) were more frequently used in the tertiary MCC.", 
    "598": "We observed similar frequency of use of nitrates and calcium antagonists in both centers. There was a higher use of beta blockers in primary MCC. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and antiplatelet agents were more used in the tertiary MCC. In relation to the updated literature, the best pharmacotherapy to coronary artery disease should be optimized in both centers.", 
    "599": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to improve insulin sensitivity during either short-term or long-term administration. Recent studies indicate that endothelin-1 (ET-1) has potent glycogenolytic effects in rat hepatocytes and may cause insulin resistance in rat adipocytes. In addition, ET may also have a role in stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. To test the hypothesis that part of the effect of captopril in enhancing insulin sensitivity may be mediated via ET and/or by glucocorticoids, we measured 24-h urinary excretion of ET and free cortisol before and after short-term treatment with captopril. The 24-h urinary immunoreactive endothelin (IR-ET) excretion decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from 65 +/- 4 ng at baseline to 42 +/- 3 ng after captopril treatment, whereas no significant change in the 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion was observed. Moreover, no significant change in the 24-h urinary IR-ET and free cortisol excretions was noted in the placebo-treated group. We speculate that ACE inhibitors may exert their effect on insulin sensitivity not only by blocking the renin-angiotensin and kinin systems but also by inhibiting production and/or release of ET.", 
    "600": "An activated renal endothelin (ET) system is implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, as recently shown in ET-1 transgenic mice. Because progressive renal fibrosis is also a major finding in diabetic nephropathy, we analyzed the activity of the renal ET system in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus and the effect of blocking the ETA receptor, using the orally active ETA antagonist LU 135252. The effects of long-term treatment with LU 135252 were compared with those of an ACE inhibitor. Plasma and urinary ET-1 concentrations were measured. Progression of diabetic nephropathy was analyzed by measuring urinary albumin and protein excretion. Urinary ET-1 excretion was significantly elevated as early as 7 days after induction of diabetes and increased further. The daily urine volume was significantly correlated with urine ET-1 excretion. Treatment with LU 135252 significantly decreased the ET-1 excretion by more than 50%, whereas ACE inhibition resulted only in a mild decrease. Albumin excretion was significantly decreased after ACE inhibition, whereas ETA inhibition resulted in a nonsignificant decrease. Urinary ET and albumin excretion probably reflect independent mechanisms of renal damage in diabetes.", 
    "601": "We assessed the renal effects of moderate treadmill exercise in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure (CRF). The effects of chronic administration of a specific endothelin (ET) subtype A (ETA) receptor antagonist, FR139317 (32 mg/kg/day i.p.) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (2 mg/kg/day i.p.), in combination with moderate exercise were also investigated. Eight-week-old SHR were subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy. One week after surgery the rats were divided into five groups: (a) no treadmill running; (b) moderate treadmill running, 20 m/min for 60 min (Ex) per day; (c) Ex plus FR139317; (d) Ex plus enalapril; and (e) m-Ex plus enalapril in combination with FR139317, for 4 weeks. In SHR-CRF, Ex significantly attenuated the increase in urinary protein excretion. Enalapril significantly attenuated the increase in systolic blood pressure and urinary protein excretion. FR139317 at this dose did not show any antihypertensive or renal protective effect in this model. These results suggest that moderate exercise may protect renal function in SHR CRF. They also suggest that FR139317 may not have an additional antihypertensive and renal protective effect in this exercise model.", 
    "602": "We studied target organ-protective effects of aracepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and the expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA. Aracepril (30 mg/kg) was administered orally to Izumo strain of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP/Izm) for 8 weeks from 4 weeks of age and for 4 weeks from 8 weeks of age. The expression of ET-1 and endothelial NOS (eNOS) mRNA in the heart, aorta, kidneys, and brain cortex, and the expression of neuronal NOS (bNOS) mRNA in brain cortex, were analyzed by RT-PCR/Southern blotting or RNase protection analysis. Administration of aracepril markedly lowered blood pressure and decreased left ventricular weight in SHR-SP/Izm. Expression of ET-1 mRNA in the heart, kidneys, and brain was significantly enhanced in SHR/SP/Izm compared with that in WKY/Izm. Aracepril significantly decreased the expression of ET-1 mRNA, whereas there was no significant change of that in the aorta. Although expression of eNOS mRNA in the heart, aorta, and kidneys did not show any significant difference between the two strains of rats, administration of aracepril for 8 weeks significantly decreased the expression of eNOS and bNOS mRNA in brain tissue. These results suggested that aracepril may protect major target organs by modifying the expression of ET-1 and NOS mRNA, in addition to its hypotensive effect.", 
    "603": "The effects of a nonpeptide, orally active mixed endothelin (ET) ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, SB 217242, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, were evaluated after inter-renal aortic banding in the rat. Separate sham, vehicle, and treatment groups were compared in each study. In vehicle-treated animals in the ramipril group, aortic banding for 4 weeks produced significant cardiac hypertrophy (247 +/- 5 mg/100 g bw vs. 305 +/- 11 mg/100 g bw; p < 0.001), right (upstream) renal hypertrophy (380 +/- 6 mg/100 g bw vs. 559 +/- 28 mg/100 g bw; p < 0.001), and significant left (downstream) renal atrophy (405 +/- 4 mg/100 g bw vs. 192 +/- 25 mg/100 g bw; p < 0.001). Continuous ramipril treatment (1 mg/kg p.o. once daily), begun 3 days before aortic banding, inhibited cardiac hypertrophy (305 +/- 11 mg/100 g bw vs. 266 +/- 7 mg/100 g bw; p < 0.05) but did not alter renal hypertrophy or atrophy. In a similarly designed study, SB 217242 (30 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) had no effect on the development of cardiac hypertrophy (298 +/- 7 mg/100 g bw vs. 310 +/- 12 mg/100 g bw) or renal hypertrophy (561 +/- 15 mg/100 g bw vs. 575 +/- 19 mg/100 g bw), but abolished the development of renal atrophy (158 +/- 16 mg/100 g bw vs. 395 +/- 19 mg/100 g bw; p < 0.001). [125I]ET-1 radioligand binding experiments indicated that the density of both ETA and ETB receptors was increased dramatically (three- to fourfold) in the atrophic kidney cortex compared to sham or hypertrophic kidneys. In situ hybridization studies indicate an upregulation of ETB receptor mRNA in the glomeruli of atrophic kidneys within 5 days of aortic banding. In conclusion, an angiotensin-dependent mechanism may mediate cardiac hypertrophy associated with aortic banding, whereas ET-dependent mechanisms may mediate an atrophic response in the hypoperfused kidney, perhaps through an interaction with upregulated ETA and/or ETB receptors.", 
    "604": "The hemodynamic effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, BQ-123, a selective ETA receptor antagonist, and bosentan, a nonselective ETA and ETB receptor antagonist, were studied in dogs 4 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI) produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Reduced arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance after administration of analapril, BQ-123, and bosentan revealed that both the renin-angiotensin system and endothelin participate in maintenance of cardiovascular function in chronic MI.", 
    "605": "The purpose of this study was to identify endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitors that also possess inhibitory activity for neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The ortho-substituted benzofused macrocyclic lactams, such as CGS 26670, are generally potent NEP inhibitors but poor ACE inhibitors. CGS 26670 inhibited ECE activity with an IC50 of 600 nM, whereas it inhibited NEP and ACE activities with IC50 values of 0.9 and > 10,000 nM, respectively. This compound also prevented the conversion of big endothelin-1 (big ET-1) to ET-1 by denuded porcine coronary arterial smooth muscle with an IC50 of 200 nM. The ACE inhibitory activity is greatly is greatly improved in metasubstituted benzofused macrocyclic lactams. For example, CGS 26582 inhibited ECE, NEP, and ACE activities with IC50 values of 620, 4, and 175 nM, respectively. When injected at 30 mg/kg i.v. in conscious rats, followed by a challenge with big ET-1 at 1 nmol/kg i.v., this compound suppressed by 44% the increase in mean arterial blood pressure owing to the generation of ET-1 by ECE. Because ECE, NEP, and ACE play regulatory roles in cardiovascular and renal function, triple inhibitors of these enzymes may represent a novel class of agents for treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases.", 
    "606": "1. Treatment with spironolactone is reported to be useful when combined with loop diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in severe congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the effects of the addition of spironolactone on exercise capacity and neurohormonal variables have not been demonstrated. This study determined the effects of additive spironolactone on exercise capacity and neurohormonal factors in patients with mild CHF. 2. Oxygen uptake (VO2), plasma norepinephrine (NE), renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII), aldosterone (ALD), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured at rest and after peak exercise in nine patients with CHF (six idiopathic and three ischemic cardiomyopathy; New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III) who were already taking furosemide (mean 29 +/- 5 mg/day) and enalapril (mean 4.7 +/- 0.8 mg/day). Studies were repeated after 16 weeks of treatment with additive single daily dose of 25 mg of spironolactone. In four of nine patients, the exercise test was repeated after a 4-weeks washout of spironolactone. 3. Treatment with spironolactone caused natriuresis, decreased cardiothoracic ratio in chest X-ray (before vs. after treatment: 53.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 50.7 +/- 1.4%, P < 0.01), and improved NYHA functional class. Peak VO2 (17.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 17.5 +/- 2.2 ml/min/kg, NS) and heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise were not altered. Resting NE (215 +/- 41 vs. 492 +/- 85 pg/ml, P < 0.01) and resting PRA (8.2 +/- 2.3 vs. 16.2 +/- 4.1 ng/ml/hr, P < 0.01) as well as peak NE (1618 +/- 313 vs. 2712 +/- 374 pg/ml, P < 0.01) and peak PRA (12.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 28.1 +/- 11.8 ng/ml/hr, P = 0.17) were augmented after additive spironolactone. ALD and AII were insignificantly increased, and ANP was insignificantly decreased at peak exercise after spironolactone treatment. Spironolactone washout was associated with a trend of the neurohormones to return toward pretreatment values. 4. In conclusion, chronic additive treatment with spironolactone was associated with neurohormonal activation both at rest and during exercise without changing the exercise capacity of patients with mild CHF who were already on loop diuretics and ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "607": "Outcome trials are the scientific method of determining if an antihypertensive agent really works; and for a therapy to work well, it should reduce mortality. The FDA requires only that blood pressure be controlled safely, but current evidence-based medicine demands answers to the mortality/morbidity question. We need this outcome trial information on all the classes of antihypertensives, including calcium channel blockers. For example, we often rely on surrogate endpoints such as control of blood pressure or control of PVCs. If we treat hypertensives with PVCs using beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, we may see both control of blood pressure and suppression of PVCs. However, as we learned from the CAST trial with flecainide and encainide, PVCs can be controlled, but mortality may increase. On the other hand, the Lewis trial demonstrated that captopril, an ACE inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, which is another surrogate endpoint in diabetic hypertensives with nephropathy, although blood pressure was controlled with diuretic and conventional therapy. Importantly, captopril also reduced morbidity and mortality without influencing blood pressure. Unfortunately, there are no outcome trials measuring mortality endpoints for most of the antihypertensive agents in use today, especially in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "608": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme(EC 3.4,15.1, ACE) in presence of captopril, lisinopril and enalapril were investigated in kidney, lung and serum of sheep using Hip-His-Leu(HHL) as substrate. The activity in kidney, lung and serum was inhibited at HHL concentration above 5 mM. The inhibitory constants (IC50) ranged between 5.6 nM for serum ACE with lisinopril and 70000 nM for renal ACE with enalapril while Ki ranged from 1.0 nM for serum ACE with lisinopril to 12000 nM for kidney ACE with enalapril. Differences in inhibition observed in different tissues suggest that the inhibitors may block function(s) of ACE to varying degrees in each tissue.", 
    "609": "Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to influence favorably the structural remodeling of the heart after myocardial infarction, the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors improve survival are not well understood. The hypothesis that ACE inhibitors may possess antiarrhythmic activity has been studied in various isolated tissue preparations. However, the electrophysiologic effects of ACE inhibitors in the intact heart are not well understood. The effect of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat on intact heart electrophysiology was studied by using multisite optical action-potential recordings with voltage-sensitive dyes. Action potentials were recorded simultaneously from 128 left ventricular epicardial sites in 15 Langendorff perfused hearts subjected to an endocardial cryoablation procedure, which was used to restrict propagation to a thin viable rim of epicardium. Action-potential duration (APD) was significantly prolonged in 67% of preparations perfused with 5 mg/L enalaprilat. Higher concentration of enalaprilat (50 mg/L) prolonged APD in all preparations tested. This APD-prolonging effect persisted over a broad range of stimulus rates, indicating the absence of reverse use-dependent properties. Enalaprilat did not modify conduction velocity, nor did it affect spatial dispersion of repolarization times. In addition, enalaprilat had no effect on ventricular fibrillation threshold and failed to suppress the initiation of ventricular tachycardia using an anatomically defined reentrant circuit. These findings indicate that in the intact heart, enalaprilat does indeed have electrophysiologic effects that cause APD prolongation, particularly at high drug concentrations. However, this effect was not of sufficient magnitude in the guinea pig to suppress the initiation of ventricular fibrillation or reentrant ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "610": "There is mechanistic rationale to suggest differential effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)-receptor antagonism on ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). We compared the effects of ACE inhibition, AT1-receptor antagonism, and their combination on post-MI ventricular remodeling in rats. We induced MI in 62 rats, which then received one of four treatments: (a) placebo; (b) the ACE inhibitor, enalapril; (c) the AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan; and (d) enalapril and losartan in combination. Two weeks after MI, we examined: (a) heart weight (HW)/body weight (BW) ratio; (b) nonmyocyte cellular proliferation in the noninfarct zone by using proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining; and (c) collagen content within the noninfarct zone. Placebo-treated, infarcted rats developed significant increases in HW/BW ratio (p < 0.001), left ventricular (LV) volume (p < 0.01), nonmyocyte cellular proliferation (p < 0.04), and collagen content (p < 0.01) compared with noninfarcted controls. Enalapril, losartan, and combination therapy limited the increase in HW/BW ratio (all p values <0.01 vs. placebo). Enalapril inhibited nonmyocyte proliferation (p < 0.01 vs. placebo), whereas losartan had a smaller effect (p = NS vs. placebo; p < 0.03 vs. enalapril); combined treatment also reduced nonmyocyte cellular proliferation but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08 vs. placebo). Enalapril and combination treatment significantly diminished collagen content (both p values <0.01 vs. placebo), whereas losartan did not. Thus, ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor antagonism equally limited myocardial hypertrophy after MI in rats, but ACE inhibition more effectively prevented nonmyocyte cellular proliferation and collagen deposition in the noninfarcted myocardium. Combination therapy was no more effective than was ACE inhibition alone. These data suggest that the myocyte hypertrophic response after MI is strongly influenced by activation of the AT1 receptor, whereas nonmyocyte cellular proliferation and collagen deposition result, in part, from mechanisms separate from AT1-receptor activation.", 
    "611": "In this Standard of Laboratory Practice we recommend guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of cardiac drugs. Cardiac drugs are primarily used for treatment of angina, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure. Digoxin, used in congestive heart failure, is widely prescribed and therapeutically monitored. Monitoring and use of antiarrhythmics such as disopyramide and lidocaine have been steadily declining. Immunoassay techniques are currently the most popular methods for measuring cardiac drugs. Several reasons make measurement of cardiac drugs in serum important: their narrow therapeutic index, similarity in clinical complications and presentation of under- and overmedicated patients, need for dosage adjustments, and confirmation of patient compliance. Monitoring may also be necessary in other circumstances, such as assessment of acetylator phenotypes. We present recommendations for measuring digoxin, quinidine, procainamide (and N-acetylprocainamide), lidocaine, and flecainide. We discuss guidelines for measuring unbound digoxin in the presence of an antidote (Fab fragments), for characterizing the impact of digoxin-like immunoreactive factor (DLIF) and other cross-reactants on immunoassays, and for moni-toring the unbound (free fraction) of drugs that bind to alpha1-acid glycoprotein. We also discuss logistic, clinical, hospital, and laboratory practice guidelines needed for implementation of a successful therapeutic drug monitoring service for cardiac drugs.", 
    "612": "Anemia associated with ACE inhibitors is rare but it may cause problems especially in patients with renal disease. This study assessed the acute effect of trandolapril, an ACE inhibitor, on serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels in uremic and hypertensive patients. Trandolapril 2 mg/day was given orally for three days and blood samples were collected on the first and third day. Trandolapril led to a significant decrease in serum EPO in patients with chronic renal failure. Although the drug lowered serum EPO in hypertensive patients, this effect was not statistically significant. This drop in serum EPO levels may be one of the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors cause anemia, or worsen anemia, in uremic patients and further studies are needed to clarify this point.", 
    "613": "Mechanical strain reportedly stimulates the synthesis of collagen in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The present study was designed to investigate a possible involvement of angiotensin II (Ang II) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in stretch-induced collagen synthesis of cultured SMCs derived from the rabbit aortic media. SMCs were cyclically stretched at a rate of 10% elongation and 30 cycles/min for 24 h using the Flexercell strain unit (Flexcell International Corp., McKeesport, Pa.). A two-fold increase in collagen synthesis and a concurrent increase in total protein synthesis were noted in stretched SMCs. Concentration of immunoreactive Ang II in the conditioned medium was elevated under the mechanical strain. Stretch-induced collagen and total protein synthesis were inhibited by either a selective antagonist to Ang II (saralasin), an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) or an antisense oligonucleotide for angiotensinogen mRNA. An elevated secretion of TGF-beta, both active and latent forms, was found in the medium of stretched SMCs. Saralasin inhibited the stretch-induced secretion of TGF-beta from SMCs. Stretch-induced collagen and total protein synthesis was further inhibited by either an anti-TGF-beta1 neutralizing antibody or an adenovirus-mediated transfer of a truncated TGF-beta type II receptor. Elevated expression of collagen alpha1(III) chain and TGF-beta1 mRNAs, and its reversal by saralasin were also demonstrated in stretched SMCs. Results indicate that the stretch-induced collagen and total protein synthesis appears to be mediated via an autocrine-paracrine mechanism of Ang II and TGF-beta released from SMCs.", 
    "614": "A beneficial effect in blood pressure control is presumed for patients on an intensive preoperative antihypertensive regimen who undergo empiric renal revascularization. Nonetheless, a noticeable decline in surgical cure rates for hypertension has been recently observed in patients with generalized atherosclerosis. The outcome of patients on multiple preoperative antihypertensive agents who underwent combined aortic and renal artery reconstruction was reviewed. The study population comprised 43 patients who underwent concomitant renal artery and aortic reconstruction for atherosclerotic disease between 1983 and 1995 and who were taking two or more antihypertensive medications and had a serum creatinine of less than or equal to 1.7 mg/dL. Operative management included an aortic reconstruction with either unilateral (n = 22) or bilateral (n = 19) aortorenal bypass or renal endarterectomy (n = 2). Operative mortality was 4.7% (2 of 43). The estimated 5-yr probability of survival was 83% (95% C.I. 0.70, 0.99). Late follow-up data on blood pressure control were available for review in 32 patients at a median follow-up of 37 months. Hypertension was cured in 1 (3%) and improved in an additional 15 (47%) patients. The numbers of antihypertensive medications taken preoperatively (mean = 2.7) declined at late follow-up (mean = 1.6). Notably, the largest reduction was observed with beta blockers (p = 0.006), central sympatholytics (p = 0.041), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (p = 0.052). The number of preoperative antihypertensive medications was not significantly related to survival or to blood pressure improvement. However, uncontrolled preoperative hypertension despite antihypertensive therapy was associated with a favorable blood pressure response to operation (p < 0.001). Patients on an intensive antihypertensive regimen can safely undergo concomitant renal artery and aortic reconstruction for the empiric management of hypertension. Poorly controlled preoperative hypertension in the presence of multiple antihypertensive agents is a favorable marker for improved postoperative blood pressure control.",

    "616": "The objective of this work was to investigate a common but poorly understood category of crystalline organic substances: isomorphic desolvates. When solvent is lost from a crystal lattice but the lattice retains its three-dimensional order, a lattice is created which is in a high-energy state relative to the original solvate structure. The desolvated lattice can reduce its internal energy by either resorbing solvent or by relaxation processes which increase the packing efficiency of the solid by reducing the unit cell volume. In the following paper, solid-state properties of isomorphic desolvates of cephalexin, cefaclor, erythromycin A, and spirapril hydrochloride hydrates are investigated. The hygroscopicity of the compounds are evaluated using a vacuum moisture balance, and structural relaxation is measured using a combination of X-ray powder diffraction and isothermal microcalorimetry. The study results are explained in terms of Kitaigorodski's close packing principle.",

    "620": "We report, in conjunction with other findings, the evolution of the dispersion of QT and QTc in patients who for the last 7 years have been treated with enalapril for systemic hypertension with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Twenty-four essential hypertensive patients who had received no previous treatment took enalapril (20 mg twice daily) for 7 years. In a pretreatment placebo phase and 8 weeks and 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 years after the start of therapy, cardiovascular parameters were determined by two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography, and the QT interval and corrected QT interval (QTc) and their dispersions were obtained from amplified standard 12-lead electrocardiograms. Therapy rapidly reduced blood pressure (BP) from 156/105 mm Hg to normal values; at 7-year follow-up, BP was 130/84 mm Hg (p <0.001 with respect to the placebo phase). LV mass index decreased progressively until at 5-year follow-up the reduction had reached 39% (p <0.001), after which neither LV mass index nor any structural parameter underwent any further significant change. LV pump function was also significantly better after 7 years of treatment. During this time, QT and QTc decreased significantly, as did the dispersion of both QT (from 61+/-21 to 37+/-14 ms) and QTc (from 67+/-27 to 41+/-16 ms). We conclude that long-term enalapril treatment of hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy not only induces marked regression of LV mass and improved LV systolic function, but also reduces the dispersions of QT and QTc, which probably reduces the likelihood of ventricular arrhythmias and improves prognosis.", 
    "621": "The effect of balloon injury on the arterial signal transduction pathway has not been examined. In vitro studies show that extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, play a critical role in the activation of transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cell proliferation or apoptosis. However, the activation and role of MAPKs in vascular diseases in vivo remain to be determined. Therefore, we examined the effect of balloon injury on arterial MAPKs and the possible role of angiotensin II.", 
    "622": "Arterial JNK and ERK activities were measured by in-gel kinase assay. AP-1 DNA binding activity was determined by gel mobility shift analysis. After balloon injury of rat carotid artery, JNK (p46JNK and p55JNK) and ERK (p44ERK and p42ERK) activities were increased as early as 2 minutes, reached their peak (6- to 18-fold) at 5 minutes, and thereafter rapidly declined to control levels. JNK and ERK activations were followed by a 3.9-fold increase in arterial AP-1 DNA binding activity, which contained c-Jun and c-Fos proteins. Arterial JNK activation at 2 or 5 minutes was remarkably suppressed by E4177 (an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist) and cilazapril (an ACE inhibitor). E4177 also prevented activation of ERKs by suppressing their tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas cilazapril failed to prevent such activation. The increased AP-1 DNA binding activity was significantly inhibited by both E4177 and cilazapril.", 
    "623": "Arterial JNKs and ERKs are dramatically activated by balloon injury associated with the activation of the AP-1 complex. These MAPK activations, followed by AP-1 activation, are mediated at least in part by the AT1 receptor. Thus, activation of JNKs and ERKs may be responsible for balloon injury-induced neointima formation.", 
    "624": "In Caucasian subjects, an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and fatal myocardial infarction. The underlying mechanism(s) of this association is not fully understood. Pima Indians have a low incidence of nonfatal and fatal CAD despite a high prevalence of diabetes. In Pima Indians, circulating ACE levels are related to ACE genotype, but the frequency of the D allele is significantly lower than in Caucasians. A lower frequency of the D allele may underlie a low risk of CAD in this population. We examined the relationship of the ACE genotype and plasma ACE level with electrocardiographic evidence of CAD (Tecumseh criteria), hypertension, and metabolic variables associated with insulin resistance in 305 (146 men and 159 women aged 47+/-9.0 years) Pima Indians characterized for the ACE I/D genotype. The distribution of ACE genotypes was unrelated to diabetes and obesity. Fasting plasma insulin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity, plasma triglyceride concentrations, and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were not significantly different between the three ACE genotypes among nondiabetic and diabetic subjects. There was no significant association of ACE genotype with electrocardiographic evidence of CAD or with hypertension. Plasma ACE concentrations were not significantly different between nondiabetic and diabetic subjects (median, 77 [range, 21 to 1691 v 83 [7 to 238] IU/mL, P=NS). In all subjects, plasma ACE levels were associated weakly with plasma triglyceride (partial r=.20, P < .01) and total cholesterol (partial r=.13, P <.03) concentrations, but not with fasting plasma insulin or PAI-1 activity. In diabetic subjects, ACE levels were related to fasting plasma glucose concentrations (partial r=.15, P=.07). These findings would suggest that ACE gene I/D polymorphism is unlikely to be a major determinant of susceptibility to CAD in Pima Indians. Plasma ACE levels, but not ACE genotype, correlated with lipids, plasma glucose, and blood pressure, suggesting that elevated plasma ACE levels may contribute to the link between insulin resistance and CAD disease or may be a consequence of it.",

This was a prospective randomized open drug trial with blinded end-point echocardiographic and cardiac Doppler assessment in 37 subjects who had primary essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy of captopril (n = 20) versus atenolol (n = 17), adding hydrochlorothiazide if BP was not controlled by 1 month. Multiple time point measurements throughout the 1 year treatment period of the study were made of BP, echocardiographic parameters of cardiac structure and function, as well as lipid profile and blood glucose. 3. There were no significant between-group differences for captopril or atenolol with regard to BP (at baseline (mean +/- SD) 154.0/101.1 +/- 13.3/5.1 and 152.5/101.8 +/- 10.0/5.8 mmHg, respectively) which was normalized by 1 month (138.7/85.6 +/- 18.8/11.7 and 135.4/88.5 +/- 16.9/9.5 mmHg, respectively) in both treatment groups (both P < 0.01 vs baseline). Also, there were no between-group or within-group differences for any of the measures of left ventricular hypertrophy or systolic function throughout the 12 month treatment period; however, captopril alone significantly increased left ventricular early diastolic filling (P < 0.05 vs baseline) at most of the measured time points. Furthermore, there were no significant between- or within-group differences with regard to metabolic (lipids and glucose) profile over the 1 year treatment period of the present study. 4. Markers of cardiovascular risk, including BP, echocardiographic measures of left ventricular hypertrophy, lipid profile and blood glucose were not significantly different between therapies. Despite good BP control by 1 month, neither drug regimen regressed left ventricular hypertrophy. However, captopril significantly increased left ventricular early diastolic filling after 3 months of treatment.", 
    "626": "Myocarditis has been shown to be a common cause of cardiomyopathy and is believed to account for 25% of all cases in human beings. Unfortunately, the disease is difficult to detect before a myopathic process ensues. Treatment of myocarditis-induced heart failure includes the standard regimen of diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and currently, beta-adrenergic blockers. Treatment of myocarditis itself is dependent on the etiology of the illness. Treatments under investigation include immunosuppressants, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, immunoglobulins, immunomodulation, antiadrenergics, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nitric oxide inhibition (e.g., aminoguanidine), and antiviral agents. Despite advances in treatment, more work needs to be done in the early detection of myocarditis. Additionally, better means need to be established for distinguishing between viral and autoimmune forms of the disease, so that appropriate treatment can be instituted.", 
    "627": "The effects of Captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) on the median eminence (ME) of the male albino mouse have been examined using morphometric and immunohistochemical procedures. We measured the nuclear area of the ependymocytes of the ME and of the glial cells of the reticular external zone of the ME. We also determined the cell/neuropil coefficient (CNC), which expresses the relation between cellular area and neuropil of the ME, and the global volume of the ME in each animal. For the immunohistochemical study we used rabbit antiarginine-vasopressin, and compared the results in the different groups of mice. We detected an increased in the immunoreactive material (arginine-vasopressin, A-V) and an increase in the global volume of the organ and also an increase of the neuropil of the ME after the longest exposure to the drug. These alterations could be related to the inhibition of the brain angiotensin II by captopril and the accumulation of vasopressin in the fibrous tract that runs from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the neurohypophysis.",

Each class is safe and effective in reducing arterial pressure, each has its own specific mechanism(s) of action that suppress specific pressor mechanisms, and each has its own side-effects which may be overcome by substituting a drug from another class of agents. In the case of adrenergic inhibitors, more specific agents have been introduced over the years. Each succeeding new class has obviated certain adverse effects of an earlier class. In the case of alpha-adrenergic receptor inhibitors, this concept is of particular value with the alpha 1A-receptor inhibiting compounds. The alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitors have special value for elderly patients with BPH as both hypertension and the prostatic disease can be treated with one compound. The alpha 1A-antagonists may have particular value in those patients in whom further reduction of arterial pressure is not desired and this obviously includes the normotensive elderly patient and the hypertensive patient whose blood pressure is already well-controlled by other agents.",

However, their correlation with left ventricular dysfunction has not yet been thoroughly evaluated, and their interrelation with other neurohumoral systems, such as the adrenergic system and endothelin, is unclear. Therefore TNF-alpha, its soluble receptor II, IL-6, big endothelin, and noradrenaline levels were simultaneously measured in venous blood from 65 patients with heart failure in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV during therapy with digitalis, furosemide, and enalapril. TNF-alpha plasma levels were 3.2+/-0.2 SEM pg/ml in 38 patients in NYHA function class II, 4.0+/-0.3 SEM pg/ml in 16 patients in NYHA function class III, and 5.3+/-0.9 SEM pg/ml in 11 patients in NYHA function class IV (p < 0.001 vs NYHA function class II). IL-6 plasma levels were 3.1+/-0.6 SEM pg/ml in 38 patients in NYHA function class II, 5.2+/-0.8 SEM pg/ml in 16 patients in NYHA function class III, and 13.3+/-3.9 SEM pg/ml in 11 patients in NYHA function class IV (p < 0.0001 vs NYHA function class II andp < 0.0001 vs NYHA class III). Thus both cytokines increased with increasing severity of heart failure, but only IL-6 plasma levels were different in patients in the more severe function classes. TNF-alpha correlated closely with TNF soluble receptor II (r = 0.8, p < 0.0001) and modestly with serum creatinine (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001), whereas IL-6 plasma levels were not statistically related to kidney function. Significant modest correlations were also found among TNF-alpha and IL-6 (r = 0.3, p < 0.01), big endothelin (r = 0.3, p < 0.01), and noradrenaline levels (r = 0.4, <0.001). This study supports the hypothesis that in heart failure both cytokines, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, as well as neurohumoral factors, play a role in the clinical progression of the disease. Thereby levels of TNF-alpha but not IL-6 seem to be related to concomitant kidney dysfunction.", 
    "636": "Vascular injury is associated with complex interactions that lead to development of intimal hyperplasia (IH). We have demonstrated previously that the corticosteroid dexamethasone and the ACE-inhibitor enalapril are effective in suppressing the development of IH. We hypothesize that due to distinctly different pharmacologic mechanisms of action, a synergistic effect would be expected if these agents were given in combination. Forty New Zealand White rabbits underwent balloon catheter denudation of the carotid artery. Animals were divided into four equal treatment groups and received daily intramuscular injections: Group 1, saline; Group 2, enalapril 0.07 mg/kg, Group 3, dexamethasone 0.125 mg/kg; and Group 4, enalapril 0.07 mg/kg plus dexamethasone 0.125 mg/kg. Vessels were harvested at 12 weeks and intimal hyperplasia was measured as a ratio of the absolute area of IH to the normalized area enclosed by the internal elastic lamina (IH/IEL). Mean values for IH/IEL are expressed as a percent (SD): Group 1, 32.31 (14.9); Group 2, 9.47 (2.11); Group 3, 5.40 (4.14); and Group 4, 8.49 (4.27). All treatment groups demonstrated significant suppression of IH compared to the control group (p < 0.01); dexamethasone was more effective than enalapril (p = 0.01). There was no statistical difference in IH suppression between respective agents and the combination group (p > 0.10). Coadministration of dexamethasone and enalapril provides no advantage over single-agent therapy in suppressing the development of IH, suggesting that maximal suppression is obtained with single-agent treatment or that these agents affect IH through a common pathway.",

Using a composite unsatisfactory outcome measure, in-hospital adverse events were had by a greater proportion of patients initially classified as high risk compared with those classified as low risk. By multivariate analysis, age >70 years, prior MI, Killip class >1, anterior site of infarction, and the combination of hypotension and tachycardia were independent predictions of poor outcome in patients with or without ST-segment elevation on the presenting electrocardiogram. High-risk patients with ST-segment elevation were treated with thrombolytics (47.5%) or alternative forms of reperfusion therapy (9.3%) within 62 minutes and 226 minutes of hospital arrival, respectively. High-risk patients offered reperfusion therapy were also more likely to receive aspirin, beta-blockers (intravenous, oral) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors within 24 hours of infarction (all p < 0.0001), survive their event (8.4% versus 21.4% p < 0.0001), and leave the hospital sooner than those not reperfused.",

As to non-cardiological indications the most important indications are nephrological-diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies. Nowadays already different types of ACE inhibitors are available. They differ as to their chemical structure (they contain a sulphydryl or carboxyl group in the molecule, they are proline derivatives etc.) as well as by other properties (lipophilia, specificity, absorption rate, period of action). The authors gives a list of preparations encountered most frequently on our market and they discuss non obvious indications.", 
    "642": "The influence of angiotensin II (ANG II) on sympathetic ganglionic transmission was examined in the in situ, normally perfused, superior cervical ganglion in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rabbits. Compound action potentials were evoked in the external carotid nerve by repetitive electrical stimulation of the decentralized preganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve (supramaximal intensity, 1 ms, 0.5 Hz). A continuous partial nicotinic block was maintained by intravenous infusion of hexamethonium. The converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was infused to prevent the endogenous generation of ANG II. Graduated intravenous infusion of ANG II brought about graduated increases in the height of the S2 potential; the threshold rate of infusion for this effect was 40 ng min-1. At this infusion rate, the plasma concentration of ANG II was estimated to lie between 80 and 600 pg ml-1. While ANG II can modify sympathetic ganglionic transmission, it is unlikely that it has any effect at physiological plasma concentrations of circulating ANG II reported for the rabbit (2-80 pg ml-1).", 
    "643": "The study was designed to clarify whether captopril, an angiotensin-coverting enzyme inhibitor, will reduce the injury of global ischaemia and reperfusion after cardioplegic arrest in isolated guinea pig hearts, in a modified Langendorff model. The hearts were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 10 in each) and subjected to 90 min of normothermic global ischemia, followed by 30 min of reperfusion; in all groups, cardioplegic arrest was achieved by administering St. Thomas's Hospital cardioplegic solution (STHCS). The first group was utilized as the control group. In the second group, captopril (200 mumol/L) was added to STHCS. In the third group, oral pretreatment was carried out (0.3 mg/kg captopril was given twice a day for 10 days). In the fourth group, oral pretreatment was achieved and captopril-enriched solution was applied in the first 5 min of reperfusion. Although the study groups showed better recovery of contractility than the control group, in the fourth group the hearts had the best left ventricular contractile function, where contractile force (g contractility/g heart weight) was 55.4% +/- 3.8% of the preischameic values. Groups I, II, and III achieved 31.0% +/- 3.2%, 41.6% +/- 3.8%, and 48.3% +/- 3.9% of their preischaemic contractile force values. Creatine kinase leakage was significantly lower and postischaemic coronary flows, too, were significantly higher in the fourth group. Coronary flow after reperfusion increased from 48.5 +/- 6.7 to 65.2 +/- 7.1 ml/min g heart in group 4 (p < 0.05). Myocardial lipid peroxides and glutathione contents showed that there was a correlation between the depletion of myocardial glutathione content and increased lipid peroxidation. These preliminary results showed that: the addition of captopril to reperfusion solution and oral preconditioning improved post-ischameic myocardial function and decreased myocardial injury.",

    "648": "To clarify the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by captopril (Cp), interactions between tissue protein and Cp were studied by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The amide-linked adducts [hemocyanin from keyhole limpet-Cp adduct (KLH-Cp) and poly-L-Lys-Cp adduct (pLys-Cp)] using carbodiimide, and a disulfide-linked adduct [ovalbumin-Cp adduct (OVA-Cp)] were prepared. To determine the formation of the protein-Cp adduct, rabbit antisera against KLH-Cp was employed. The immunoreactivities with pLys-Cp and OVA-Cp against anti KLH-Cp sera were elevated when compared with the unmodified protein. With the inhibition ELISA, this antisera was useful for detecting the Cp disulfide-linked conjugate. In kidney cytosol, a high level of immunoreactivity was observed. Plasma and liver cytosol reactivities were similar, and approximately 40% against kidney cytosol. Thus, a method for the detection of the Cp-protein adduct using ELISA has been established. Formation of the Cp-protein adduct was observed in rat plasma and in liver and kidney cytosol. These findings suggest the possibility that the formation of Cp-protein adduct is partially related to cytotoxicity in liver.",

In many patients, the benefits of beta blockers will outweigh relative contraindications. Aspirin: meta-analyses of antiplatelet therapy in high-risk subjects have shown substantial benefits. Aspirin should be prescribed for secondary prevention. Lipid lowering with statins: subgroup analyses of the major secondary prevention trials show substantial benefits across a wide range of baseline cholesterol and LDL levels. These drugs should be prescribed as secondary prevention to patients with diabetes whose total cholesterol is > 4.0 mmol(-1). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): the few subgroup analyses that exist from ACEI trials suggest that diabetic and non-diabetic patients derive similar benefits.

Echocardiography revealed left ventricular histological. Coronary arteriography showed normal coronary arteries. Finding of histological examination of the endomyocardial biopsy were described as necrosis of myocytes and abnormal blood flow in very small coronary vessels.

    "652": "The success of PTCA is limited by late restenosis, which occurs in 30-50% of all cases, chiefly within the first six months after the intervention. Restenosis is due to the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and especially to overproduction of extracellular matrix in the arterial wall. The coronary intervention is followed by a not fully defined constrictive process of wound healing, so-called remodeling. Various alternative intervention techniques were investigated but did not show any clear advantage concerning restenosis compared to PTCA. Although the rate of restenosis is reduced by stent implantation, which hinders remodeling, the remaining intimal hyperplasia often leads to restenosis. In spite of promising results in animal models, to date no effective human pharmacological therapy has been found to prevent restenosis. To determine whether antioxidants, endovascular radiation or gene therapy show any benefit will require further, larger trials.", 
    "653": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was investigated on the development of cerebral vasospasm and on the endothelium-dependent relaxation in the rat subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) model. Alacepril or enalapril was used as an ACE inhibitor with or without a thiol moiety in the structure. SAH rats or sham-operated rats were produced by the injection of homologous blood or artificial cerebrospinal fluid into the cisternal magna, respectively. In the SAH rat, cerebral vasospasm was observed at 24 h after blood injection. Acetylcholine (Ach)-induced relaxation in basilar arteries from SAH rats significantly decreased compared to that from sham-operated rats, although the relaxation induced by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, sodium nitroprusside or papaverine did not decrease. These results suggest that the endothelium cell function of basilar arteries in SAH rats is damaged. Alacepril prevented both the development of cerebral vasospasm and the suppression in the Ach-induced relaxation of basilar artery in SAH rats. However, enalapril did not prevent the suppression of Ach-induced relaxation in SAH rats, despite the tendency to prevent cerebral vasospasm. Therefore, it is suggested that the preventive effect of alacepril on cerebral vasospasm could be based on its protective effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation system.", 
    "654": "Two possible sites of renal metabolism exist: intracellular, by enzymes within the peritubular cells, and intraluminal, by ecto-enzymes embedded on the brush border membrane. The esterolysis of enalapril to its dicarboxylate metabolite, enalaprilat, was studied in the isolated perfused, nonfiltering rat kidney preparation (NFK) and compared with that observed for the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPK) to ascertain the site of metabolic conversion. For the NFK, filtration was obliterated with the high oncotic pressure (8% bovine serum albumin in plasma) and ligation of the ureter, thus preventing enalapril from reaching intraluminal sites by filtration. The steady-state renal plasma clearance of enalapril in the NFK was 2.0 ml/min/g, a value similar to that (2.1 ml/min/g) observed previously for the IPK. The rate of appearance of enalaprilat, the metabolite, in venous plasma for the NFK (30 +/- 3% of the input rate of enalapril) was also comparable with that for the IPK (27 +/- 4%). Further, identification of the site of enalapril metabolism (cellular or luminal) was aided by simulations based on physiological models and parameters obtained previously on the renal handling of enalapril and enalaprilat. These parameters were optimized to match closely the experimental observations. The predicted total and metabolic renal clearances for the IPK or for the NFK were similar for both the \"cellular model\" and \"luminal model\": in both instances, values for the NFK were 59-65% of those for the IPK. By contrast, predictions for the venous output rate of enalaprilat (as a percent of the input rate of enalapril) were different: the \"cellular model\" predicted no change in value between the NFK and the IPK, whereas metabolite appearance was greatly magnified for the NFK (289% that of the IPK) with luminal metabolism. The lack of difference in venous outflow of enalaprilat for the NFK and IPK was more congruent with the notion of intracellular and not intraluminal esterolysis of enalapril.",

The IC50 values of purified ACE inhibitors were 26-36 microM. Moreover, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethanol, isoquercitrin and ursolic acid were isolated from J. grandiflorum. Sambaceins and oleacein are formed from genuine iridoid glucosides during processing of the plant material. NMR spectroscopy was used to measure the level of the ACE inhibitors in the traditional medicines prepared in Kerala from these Jasminum species.",

    "669": "An open and multicentric study was conducted with 66 patients with mild to severe diastolic arterial hypertension and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, the evolution of diastolic function, by means of doppler transmitral flow echocardiography, under treatment with ramipril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, at a dose of 2.5 and 5 mg/day, or combined with a diuretic, after three and six months of treatment. Despite not obtaining the tensional control in all patients, a decrease in the mass, both in absolute values and mass index, was obtained. This decrease was observed both in male and female patients from the first three months, which went on until the sixth month, thus suggesting an independent action of the hemodynamic load decrease for the obtention of this effect. There was also a change in the ventricular geometry with a displacement of patients from concentric enlargement to normal, remodelling and eccentric enlargement. The diastolic function improved both for the early and for the late maximal filling velocity, relationship between both, and deceleration time, although the time during which this improvement occurred was different for each parameter, thus indicating the different influence of the dynamic and structural factors on these parameters. No correlation was found between the improvement in diastolic function and hypertrophy regression. We can conclude that ramipril is useful for the control of the left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic function, irrespective of arterial tension values.",

At Week 12, the percentage of patients titrated to either enalapril 40 mg or irbesartan 300 mg was 24% and 28%, respectively. The frequency of overall adverse events was similar in both groups. The incidence of cough in the enalapril and irbesartan groups was 17% and 10%, respectively. In contrast to other AII receptor antagonists, there was no change in uric acid concentrations with irbesartan.",

Following 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo or 0.25 to 16 mg/day trandolapril, an analysis of drug effect on trough blood pressure (BP) stratified by age, gender, weight, pre-treatment plasma renin activity, and trandolaprilat concentration was performed. Two mg was the lowest effective trandolapril dose, whereas doses above 4 mg did not significantly reduce trough BP. Reduction in BP did not correlate with trough plasma trandolaprilat concentration. Pre-treatment plasma renin activity was not a reliable indicator of anti-hypertensive response, as similar reductions in BP occurred even in patients with the lowest renin levels. There were no observable differences based on age, gender or measurements of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. In conclusion, neither age, gender or plasma renin activity influenced anti-hypertensive response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in African-Americans.", 
    "676": "In subjects with essential hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition increases arterial diameter, compliance and distensibility of peripheral muscular arteries in association with blood pressure reduction. Whether pulse pressure amplification is modified by ACE inhibition and whether changes in compliance and distensibility are due to a drug effect on the arterial wall, to the blood pressure reduction or to a combination of both factors, is largely ignored. In a randomised, double-blind crossover trial, we used the ACE inhibitor quinapril as a marker to evaluate the changes in: pulse pressure amplification (applanation tonometry), carotid compliance and distensibility (echo-tracking technique), and aortic distensibility (measured from pulse wave velocity). Quinapril decreased in the same extent carotid and brachial pulse pressure, thus causing a resetting of pulse pressure amplification toward normal values. Carotid compliance and distensibility as well as aortic distensibility increased significantly. Based on three-way analysis of variance, it was shown that, whereas the changes in carotid stiffness were exclusively due to blood pressure reduction and not to a drug-induced relaxation of the arterial wall, the changes in aortic distensibility were due to the combination of both factors. Thus, using an atraumatic non-invasive procedure, it was possible to show that: (i) ACE inhibition is able to maintain pulse pressure amplification, an important factor contributing to reduce the afterload of the heart; and (ii) ACE inhibition alters the hypertensive arterial wall in a very heterogeneous manner, with a maximal drug effect on muscular large arteries like the abdominal aorta, and not on elastic arteries like the carotid artery and the thoracic aorta.",

Increased use of medications known to be effective in persons with heart failure (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and adequate diuretic therapy) might reduce the likelihood of decompensation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive drugs used in dialytic patients in Piedmont and to identify correlations with other personal and clinical data. The authors analysed the data in the Piedmont Dialysis and Transplant Register concerning new patients admitted to dialysis during the period 1990-1995 (2,664 patients at 31/12/1995) and 1,373 patients who began dialysis during the period 1990-1993. A study of the antihypertensive drugs using in single and combined therapy over the five-year period shows major variations in the 45-65 year-old age bracket (increased ACE-inhibitors in single therapy, 15.5-25.6%, increased vasodilators in combined therapy, 15.3-21%). In patients aged > or = 65 years old a slight increase was found in the use of beta-blockers in monotherapy. Antihypertensive drugs at the 1st control (1990-1995 entries) appeared to be stable over the five-year period. From the 1,373 patients who started dialysis in the period 1990-1993, with at least three subsequent controls, the authors selected those hypertensive or normotensive patients receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy (best survival in general population) and compared their survival with that of patients receiving alternative antihypertensive treatment. No significant differences were found. The stability of the antihypertensive drugs taken by these patients over the past 5 years backs the hypothesis of a greater attention paid by nephrologists to the introduction of new drugs, both because of the frequent onset of collateral effects and owing to the special pharmacokinetics present in dialytic patients.",

Renal biopsy ruled out tissue lesions induced by cyclosporine, chronic rejection, recurrence of diabetic kidney disease and de novo glomerulopathies. Captopril-enhanced nephrography and a high plasma renin response suggested renal artery disease. Angiography revealed five intrarenal arterial stenoses. Four were successfully dilated with a prompt diuretic response and diminished proteinuria. Late angiography showed a moderate restenosis in two of the dilated arteries. Due to persistent proteinuria, elevated blood pressure and higher serum creatinine levels than at nadir after transplantation low-dose ACE inhibitor therapy was started. This normalized proteinuria, blood pressure and serum creatinine levels. This beneficial response to combined renal artery balloon angioplasty and medical treatment has been sustained for 2.5 years.",

Maximal ACE-inhibition was 75% after the single dose as well as at steady state. ACE inhibition before drug intake at day 28 (i.e. trough) was 50%. The (placebo-corrected) maximal drop in diastolic blood pressure after imidapril was 22 mm Hg after the first dose and 25 mmHg at steady state. Exploratory analysis of imidaprilat plasma concentration vs effect profiles suggests a hyperbolic concentration effect relationship where data of the single dose contribute to the ascending part of an Emax-curve, whereas the plateau around Emax is maintained at steady state.", 
    "687": "In this group of hypertensive patients, the pharmacokinetic profile and the drop in ACE-activity as well as in blood pressure seen after a single dose of imidapril and at steady state were similar.

    "688": "ACE inhibitors have achieved widespread usage in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal disease. ACE inhibitors alter the balance between the vasoconstrictive, salt-retentive, and hypertrophic properties of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the vasodilatory and natriuretic properties of bradykinin and alter the metabolism of a number of other vasoactive substances. ACE inhibitors differ in the chemical structure of their active moieties, in potency, in bioavailability, in plasma half-life, in route of elimination, in their distribution and affinity for tissue-bound ACE, and in whether they are administered as prodrugs. Thus, the side effects of ACE inhibitors can be divided into those that are class specific and those that relate to specific agents. ACE inhibitors decrease systemic vascular resistance without increasing heart rate and promote natriuresis. They have proved effective in the treatment of hypertension, they decrease mortality in congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and they delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Ongoing studies will elucidate the effect of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular mortality in essential hypertension, the role of ACE inhibitors in patients without ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and the role of ACE inhibitors compared with newly available angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists.",

Heart rate was not affected by the respective interventions (75+/-11 versus 76+/-13 versus 75+/-10 bpm; P=NS), whereas mean aortic pressure dropped slightly after IC enalaprilat and significantly after SL captopril (90+/-8 versus 85+/-10 versus 74+/-9 mm Hg; P<.05). Compared with baseline, IC enalaprilat resulted in a decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure (17.6+/-5.9 versus 14.4+/-4.9 mm Hg; P<.05), time constant of isovolumic LV pressure relaxation (tauG) (69+/-9 versus 52+/-10 ms; P<.05), and outflow gradient (45.2+/-6.9 versus 24.4+/-3.7 mm Hg; P<.05) and in an increase in coronary blood flow (107+/-10 versus 127+/-12 mL/min; P<.05) and coronary flow reserve (2.2+/-0.4 versus 2.6+/-0.3; P<.05).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment could affect hypertension-related hypalgesia. Twenty-five untreated hypertensive patients, together with a control group of 14 normotensive subjects, underwent dental pain perception evaluation by means of a pulpar test (graded increase of test current applied to healthy teeth). After the evaluation of the dental pain threshold (occurrence of pulp sensation) and tolerance (time when the subjects asked for the test to be stopped), all the subjects underwent a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The hypertensive group then was treated with 20 mg/d enalapril, whereas the normotensive subjects remained without any treatment. After a time interval of 6+/-2 months, the dental pain sensitivity was retested in all the subjects, and ambulatory blood pressure was recorded during treatment in the hypertensive patients. At the first assessment, hypertensive patients showed a higher pain threshold than normotensive subjects (P<.001). On retesting of pain sensitivity in hypertensive patients, a significant decrease of both pain threshold and tolerance, leading to their normalization, was observed during treatment (P<.001 and P<.005, respectively), in the presence of reduced 24-hour and office blood pressure values. A slight, though significant, correlation was observed between variations in pain tolerance and baseline blood pressure changes occurring during treatment. During follow-up, the normotensive subjects did not show any significant pain perception or office blood pressure changes. Hypertension-related hypalgesia was confirmed. Mechanisms acting both through lowering of blood pressure and specific pharmacodynamic properties may account for the normalization of pain sensitivity observed in hypertensive patients during treatment with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "697": "Dietary salt restriction is a recommended adjunct with antihypertensive therapy. There may be racial differences in blood pressure response to salt restriction while on antihypertensive therapy. We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (black, n=96; Hispanic, n=63; white, n=232). Participants were initially preselected for stage I to III hypertension and then further selected for salt sensitivity (> or = 5 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure after 3 weeks of low salt [< or = 88 mmol/d Na+] and high salt [>190 mmol/d Na+] diet). We compared the antihypertensive effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 5 or 20 mg BID) or a calcium channel antagonist (isradipine 5 or 10 mg BID) during alternating periods of high and low salt intake. The main outcome measure was blood pressure change and absolute blood pressure level achieved with therapy. During the high salt diet (314.7+/-107.5 mmol/d urinary Na+) there was greater downward change in blood pressure with both enalapril and isradipine compared with the low salt diet (90.1+/-50.8 mmol/d Na+); however, the absolute blood pressure achieved in all races was consistently lower on a low salt diet for both agents. Black, white, and Hispanic isradipine-treated salt-sensitive hypertensives demonstrated a smaller difference between high and low salt diets (black, -3.6/-1.6 mmHg; white, -6.2/-3.9 mmHg; Hispanic, -8.1/-5.3 mm Hg) than did enalapril-treated patients (black, -9.0/-5.3 mm Hg; white, -11.8/-7.0 mm Hg; Hispanic, -11.1/-5.6 mm Hg). On the low salt diet, blacks, whites, and Hispanics had similar blood pressure control with enalapril and isradipine. On the high salt diet, blacks had better blood pressure control with isradipine than with enalapril, whereas there was no difference in the blood pressure control in whites and Hispanics treated with either drug. Dietary salt reduction helps reduce blood pressure in salt-sensitive hypertensive blacks, whites, and Hispanics treated with enalapril or isradipine. These data demonstrate that controlling for salt sensitivity diminishes race-related differences in antihypertensive activity.", 
    "698": "Spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina (IEL) occurs in some arteries of the rat during growth and aging. Inbred, normotensive, Brown Norway (BN) rats are particularly susceptible to rupture of the IEL, especially in the abdominal aorta (AA). Preliminary experiments showed that different angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors protect against rupture of the IEL in the BN rat to a greater extent than hydralazine, suggesting a role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in this phenomenon. To explore this possibility, we have treated male BN rats from 4.5 to 14 weeks of age with either enalapril or losartan (both at 1, 3, and 10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) or with the calcium antagonists mibefradil (at 3, 10, 30, and 45 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and amlodipine (at 30 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured weekly, and at the end of treatment we (1) recorded body and heart weights, (2) measured various parameters of the RAS in plasma, (3) quantified interruptions in the IEL on \"en face\" preparations of AA, and (4) quantified elastin, collagen, and cell proteins in the media of the thoracic aorta. Results showed that enalapril and losartan similarly decrease SBP and rupture of the IEL in the AA, suggesting that enalapril inhibits the latter via a decrease in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II) and not via another effect on ACE. The decrease in IEL rupture and in SBP, as well as the modifications in the parameters of the RAS, were all dose dependent. Mibefradil had little effect on the RAS and, at the highest doses, decreased SBP to an extent similar to that for enalapril at 3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) but did not significantly inhibit IEL rupture. Amlodipine decreased SBP, increased plasma renin concentration, and was without effect on IEL rupture. All treatments at the highest doses had a hypotrophic effect on the aortic media but differed in their effects on the heart, with enalapril and losartan decreasing and mibefradil and amlodipine increasing heart weight, suggesting that the inhibition of IEL rupture may be related to a cardiac hypotrophic effect. All these results, taken together, suggest that Ang II plays a role in the rupture of the IEL that is, in part, independent of SBP.",

Aggressive management of etiologic factors, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular disease and excessive alcohol intake, can prevent the left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction that lead to heart failure. Early intervention with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction can prevent, as well as treat, the syndrome. Several intervention strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction can slow or prevent the left ventricular remodeling process that antedates congestive heart failure. The primary care physician must be alert to the need for aggressive intervention to reduce the burden of heart failure syndrome on the patient and on society.",

Negligible enzyme activity was found in cortical tumor whereas highly significant activities were present in the P2 fractions of the two pheochromocytoma specimens. The hydrolysis rates, expressed in terms of the percent of added substrate were 58-66%/60 min for Hip-Phe-Arg, 55-58%/60 min for Hip-Arg-Phe and 19-30%/60 min for Hip-His-Leu. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, differentially inhibited the enzyme splitting Hip-His-Leu versus the one cleaving Hip-Arg-Phe; Hip-Phe-Arg is probably the substrate of both. It is concluded that the Hip-Arg-Phe-cleaving enzyme in adrenomedullary tumor is probably identical to the purportedly novel dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that we detected earlier in rabbit ear artery wall, which converts (Met5)-enkephalin-Arg6,Phe7 to (Met5)-enkephalin.", 
    "703": "It is believed that angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower proteinuria by acting on glomerular hemodynamics. This hypothesis predicts that the urinary excretion of a tubular protein should be unaffected by ACE inhibition. In the present study we have compared the excretion of albumin and Tamm-Horsfall Glycoprotein (THGP), a protein secreted only by renal tubules, before and after ACE inhibition. Urinary protein excretion was measured with the Phast System, a method based on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining, in 15 essential hypertensives, after at least 4 weeks of wash-out from any drug and after 2 months of ACE inhibition with oral Quinapril. After 2 months of ACE inhibition, blood pressure (BP), body weight, urinary output, heart rate, plasma glucose, plasma and urinary creatinine, urate and electrolytes, and creatinine clearance, were not different from baseline values. Plasma ACE activity decreased from 76 +/- 7 to 10 +/- 4 U/mL (mean +/- SEM, 2 tails paired t test, p = 0.0001). Both albumin and THP urinary excretions decreased from 51 +/- 6 to 43 +/- 4 mg/ 24 h (p = 0.05) and from 19 +/- 3 to 12 +/- 1 mg/24 h (p = 0.02), respectively.

Overall the GFR declined linearly by 0.46 +/- 0.05 ml/min/1.73 m2/month (mean rate +/- SEM) over a median follow-up of 23 months (range 3 to 64 months), and progression to ESRF was 17.3%. Using multivariate analysis, higher UProt and mean arterial pressure (MAP) independently correlated with a faster delta GFR (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively) and progression to ESRF (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Mean UProt and systolic blood pressure during follow-up were the only time-dependent covariates that significantly correlated with delta GFR (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively) and ESRF (P = 0.006 and P = 0.0001, respectively). After stratification for baseline UProt, patients in the lowest tertile (UProt < 1.9 g/24 hr) had the slowest delta GFR (0.16 +/- 0.07 ml/min/1.73 m2/month) and progression to ESRF (4.3%) as compared with patients in the middle tertile (UProt 2.0 to 3.8 g/24hr; delta GFR, 0.55 +/- 0.09 ml/min/1.73 m2/month, P = 0.0002; ESRF, 15.3%, P = 0.0001) and in the highest tertile (UProt 3.9 to 18.8 g/24 hr; delta GFR, 0.70 +/- 0.11 ml/min/1.73 m2/month, P = 0.0001; ESRF, 32.5%, P = 0.0001). Both delta GFR (P = 0.01) and progression to ESRF (P = 0.01) significantly differed even between the middle and the highest tertiles. On the contrary, stratification in tertiles of baseline MAP failed to segregate subgroups of patients into different risk levels. Patients with the highest proteinuria and blood pressure were those with the fastest progression (delta GFR, 0.91 +/- 0.23; ESRF 34.7%). Of interest, at each level of baseline MAP, a higher proteinuria was associated with a faster delta GFR and progression to ESRF. On the other hand, at each level of proteinuria, a faster delta GFR was associated with MAP only in the highest tertile (> 112 mm Hg) and the risk of ESRF was independent of the MAP. Thus, in chronic nephropathies proteinuria is the best independent predictor of both disease progression and ESRF. Arterial hypertension may contribute to the acceleration of renal injury associated with enhanced traffic of plasma proteins. Antihypertensive drugs that most effectively limit protein traffic at comparable levels of blood pressure are those that most effectively slow disease progression and delay or prevent ESRF in proteinuric chronic nephropathies.",

Irrespective of the time since infarction, patients with an end-diastolic volume index greater than 100 mL/m2 and an ejection fraction less than 50% at the time of first angiography were at high risk of progressive ventricular dilation and further deterioration of left ventricular function (for both, P = .003). This process was independent of extent of coronary artery involvement and coronary disease progression. Multivariate analysis identified ejection fraction at the time of index angiography as the strongest predictor of further left ventricular dilation (P = .0004).", 
    "707": "Continuing left ventricular dilation occurs in less than half the patients who had myocardial infarction. Left ventricular ejection fraction is the most sensitive parameter to predict the risk of ventricular dilation after infarction.", 
    "708": "This study was designed to determine regional differences in patient characteristics and medication use among patients entered into an international heart failure trial.", 
    "709": "Data for this analysis were derived from the Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival Study (ATLAS), a prospective randomized comparison of high- and low-dose therapy with lisinopril in patients with New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV chronic heart failure, which enrolled 3164 patients in 291 centers in 19 countries on 3 continents. Information was collected at baseline concerning patient demographics, etiology of heart failure, accompanying conditions, prior revascularization procedures, and medication use. The primary findings were a lower incidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy in southern and western Europe, more frequent diabetes in North America, and a greater use of coronary revascularization in the United States and Canada. There was substantial variation in medication use, particularly with regard to digoxin, anticoagulants, and amiodarone.", 
    "710": "Although there is considerable overlap in guidelines concerning the treatment of heart failure issued by authorities in Europe and North America, there are significant regional variations in medication use. Some, but not all, of these differences can be explained by differences in patient characteristics.", 
    "711": "Previous studies showed that progression of established radiation nephropathy could be delayed by continuous treatment with high doses of captopril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The current studies were designed to determine whether a lower dose or a shorter treatment with captopril would be effective and whether an angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (AII blocker) would be effective.", 
    "712": "In the captopril studies, rats were given renal irradiation at doses sufficient to produce radiation nephropathy. Six months after irradiation, animals were stratified by azotemia and assigned to no treatment, continuous high- or low-dose captopril, or 6 weeks of high-dose captopril. Captopril was given in drinking water at 62.5 mg/l (low dose) or 500 mg/l (high dose). The AII blocker study had a similar design, except that the nephropathy was the result of total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation and the treatments were no treatment or continuous treatment with an AII blocker, L-158,809 (20 mg/l in drinking water). Animals were followed for 1 year with periodic studies of renal function.", 
    "713": "Survival and renal function were significantly enhanced by all treatments. Continuous captopril treatment was more effective than the 6-week course of treatment, but there was no difference in effectiveness between the high and low doses of captopril. In continuous therapy, captopril and the AII blocker had roughly equivalent efficacy.", 
    "714": "Both the ACE inhibitor and the AII blocker were effective treatments for established radiation nephropathy. The best results with the ACE inhibitor required continuous therapy, but could be achieved with a low dose of the drug.", 
    "715": "The primary etiologic factor in diabetic glomerulosclerosis appears to be an overproduction of transforming growth factor-beta by mesangial cells, which in turn reflects a hyperglycemically mediated overactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) throughout the glomerulus. Membrane-active antioxidants, fish oil, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can act to down-regulate glomerular PKC activity, via a variety of mechanisms that may include activation of diacylglycerol kinase and suppression of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, support of endothelial nitric oxide and heparan sulfate production, inhibition of thromboxane and angiotensin synthesis/activity, and correction of glomerular hypertension. The beneficial impact of these measures on vascular endothelial function may be of more general utility in the prevention of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and atherosclerosis. Adjunctive use of gamma-linolenic acid is indicated for prevention of neuropathy, and it is conceivable that bioactive chromium will have protective activity not solely attributable to improved glycemic control. Re-establishing euglycemia must clearly remain the core strategy for preventing diabetic complications, but when glycemic control remains suboptimal, practical, safe measures are at hand for decreasing risk.", 
    "716": "Several antihypertensive medications affect lower urinary tract function and may cause urinary incontinence.", 
    "717": "A 59-year-old woman on doxazosin mesylate for control of her hypertension presented with stress urinary incontinence. Because this drug is known to cause loss of urethral tone leading to stress incontinence in some patients, she was switched to enalapril maleate, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Her incontinence improved on the new medication, but she developed a persistent dry cough that continued to cause episodic stress incontinence. Because a persistent cough is a known side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, her medication was changed to a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine besylate. Her cough resolved, and her stress incontinence was no longer a clinical problem.", 
    "718": "Gynecologists should be aware of the unexpected side effects of medications on the lower urinary tract.", 
    "719": "To compare the effects of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the beta-blocker carvedilol on blood pressure and endothelial functions in NIDDM patients with hypertension.", 
    "720": "We conducted a double-blind randomized trial in 26 patients with NIDDM and mild hypertension. A 4-week run-in placebo period preceded the active 12-week treatment with perindopril (4-8 mg daily) or carvedilol (25-50 mg daily). Endothelial functions were assessed by evaluating the hemodynamic (mean blood pressure, leg blood flow) and rheological (platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and blood filterability) responses to an intravenous bolus of 3 g L-arginine, the natural precursor of nitric oxide.", 
    "721": "Both perindopril and carvedilol significantly reduced mean blood pressure (P < 0.001) and increased leg blood flow (P < 0.05) to the same extent; blood filterability remained unchanged in both perindopril- and carvedilol-treated groups. Carvedilol reduced platelet aggregation and blood viscosity significantly (P < 0.05) but perindopril did not. Before treatment, the hemodynamic and rheologic responses to L-arginine were significantly lower in patients (P < 0.05-0.01) than in 20 nondiabetic nonhypertensive control subjects. After 12 weeks of treatment, both drugs normalized the hemodynamic responses to L-arginine. Platelet aggregation response to L-arginine was ameliorated by carvedilol and remained unchanged in the perindopril group.", 
    "722": "At the doses used, both drugs effectively reduce blood pressure and normalize the hemodynamic responses to L-arginine. The implications of the ameliorated endothelial function for the poor cardiovascular outlook of the NIDDM hypertensive patient need further assessment.", 
    "723": "ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes.", 
    "724": "Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure of > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years. If blood pressure was not controlled, the other study drug was added.", 
    "725": "Both treatments were effective in lowering blood pressure. At the end of follow-up, between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin. The patients receiving fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of the combined outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalized angina than those receiving amlodipine (14/189 vs. 27/191; hazards ratio = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26-0.95).", 
    "726": "Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine."
