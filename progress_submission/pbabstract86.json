    "0": "Enalapril maleate, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, is a vasodilator liable to modify regional blood flow. The effects of an oral dose of 40 mg enalapril maleate on indocyanine green (ICG) kinetics were assessed in nine healthy subjects. At 4 h after the administration of the drug, a 35% decrease in ICG clearance was observed (P less than 0.01) associated with a 23% decrease in its volume of distribution (P less than 0.02). The half-life of ICG was not altered significantly by enalapril. These results suggest that the administration of enalapril maleate to healthy subjects may reduce apparent liver plasma flow and plasma volume, as a consequence of the pooling of blood in the hepatosplanchnic area.", 
    "1": "1. In a double-blind, randomised, parallel group study, 128 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 125 mm Hg (Phase V) after 2-4 weeks run-in on placebo, received enalapril 10-40 mg once daily (65 patients) or nifedipine retard 10-40 mg twice daily (63 patients), utilising a double dummy technique. Dual target blood pressures were less than 150 mm Hg systolic and less than 90 mm Hg sitting diastolic. Inadequate responders had hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-50 mg once daily added. 2. The 3 h post-dose sitting blood pressures were lowered by 18/14 mm Hg (enalapril) and 20/14 mm Hg (nifedipine), but nifedipine gave greater standing reductions (16/13 mm Hg enalapril, 22/17 mm Hg nifedipine). The dual target blood pressures were achieved by 45% of those taking enalapril monotherapy and 43% of those taking nifedipine monotherapy. At the end of the hydrochlorothiazide phase the dual target pressures were achieved by 63% of the enalapril group and 56% of the nifedipine group. 3. Overall, 17 patients reported adverse events during the placebo run-in. During the active treatment-periods, 42 patients in the enalapril group experienced adverse events, as did 49 of those on nifedipine. Orthostatic effects were confined to those taking enalapril, whereas flushing/erythema, oedema and palpitations were more common in the nifedipine group. 4. Five patients in the enalapril and 14 in the nifedipine groups were withdrawn because of adverse events. One of those withdrawn on enalapril had angioneurotic oedema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The study of vasoactive agents in man often requires accurate measurement of short-lasting changes in blood pressure. Using a noninvasive photoplethysmographic device (Finapres), the authors investigated in normotensive subjects whether rapid increases in blood pressure can be assessed precisely by monitoring finger blood pressure continuously. Six volunteers were studied on two consecutive days. On the first day, increasing doses of angiotensin I were injected intravenously with the aim to find a test dose which raised systolic blood pressure by 25 to 40 mm Hg. After oral administration of a placebo, the same test dose was injected repeatedly over the next 24 hours. On the second day, the subjects took either 6.25 (n = 3) or 25 mg (n = 3) captopril PO and the serial administration of the test dose of angiotensin I was continued for the next 4 hours. After placebo intake there was a good reproducibility of the blood pressure response to angiotensin I with a coefficient of variation of 15 +/- 4.5% (Mean +/- SD, n = 6). Captopril caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin I. These data indicate that noninvasive blood pressure monitoring at the finger represents a useful tool to study short-lasting blood pressure changes produced by vasoactive agents in man.",

    "4": "To develop a screening test for identification of renovascular hypertension, the blood pressure and plasma renin concentration responses to an oral test dose of captopril (6.25 mg) were studied in 47 hypertensive patients of mean age 61 years (range 34-85 years). Blood pressure was measured at 15-min intervals for 90 min after administration of captopril. Blood samples for plasma renin determination were drawn immediately before and 90 min after drug administration. Eleven patients had renal artery stenosis. The fall in diastolic blood pressure in these patients was greater, on average, than in patients with other forms of hypertension (30 mmHg vs. 14 mmHg, P less than 0.01), as was the increase in plasma renin concentration (188 mU l-1 vs. 2 mU l-1, P less than 0.01). This study demonstrates that the short-term captopril test is useful for distinguishing patients with renovascular disease from those with other forms of hypertension. During the test, 7 patients (15%) exhibited reversible cerebral symptoms. In two of these subjects digital subtraction angiography was performed, which revealed stenosis of the carotid artery. Consequently, it is suggested that captopril should not be used in patients with arteriosclerotic stenoses of the carotids.", 
    "5": "The stability of captopril in powder papers under three different storage conditions was determined. Captopril 12.5-mg tablets were triturated with lactose to a final concentration of 2 mg of captopril in 100 mg of powder. A total of 240 powder papers were prepared and stored in class \"A\" prescription vials (80 papers), 002G plastic zip-lock bags (80 papers), and Moisture Proof Barrier Bags (80 papers). Immediately after preparation and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks of storage at room temperature, powder papers under each storage condition were reweighed and the contents were assayed for captopril concentration by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic method. More than 90% of the initial captopril concentration was retained under all storage conditions during the first 12 weeks of the study. Captopril disulfide, a degradation product, was detected in one sample stored in a plastic zip-lock bag at 24 weeks. Captopril was stable for the entire 24-week period in powder papers stored in either the class A prescription vial or the Moisture Proof Barrier Bag. Captopril in powder papers is stable for at least 12 weeks when stored at room temperature under all three storage conditions.", 
    "6": "Diazoxide, a potent vasodilator and antidiuretic, was used to examine the relationship between hypotension and thirst in conscious rats with indwelling arterial and venous catheters. Bolus iv. injections (5-50 mg/kg) caused prompt, long-lasting, and dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and stimulated drinking. Water intake and degree of hypotension were closely correlated when MAP was 10-65 mmHg below normal. At the time of drinking there were no significant changes in central venous pressure, plasma osmolality, or Na+ or K+ concentration. Plasma glucose increased approximately 35%, and blood volume increased approximately 10% (based on hematocrit changes and dilution of Evans blue). Captopril (100 mg/kg sc to block the renin-angiotensin system) enhanced the depressor response to diazoxide but abolished the dipsogenic response over the same range of arterial pressures tested in controls. Angiotensin II iv infusion restored drinking in captopril-treated animals. The combination of captopril and diazoxide did not block drinking to iv infusions of hypertonic saline or water deprivation. These results confirm that hypotension potently stimulates thirst and support the hypothesis that angiotensin II mediates the dipsogenic response in rats.", 
    "7": "Renal hemodynamics and tubular solute and water handling were evaluated in normal subjects during water diuresis, before and after the acute administration of captopril, ibuprofen, or the combination of both drugs. The glomerular filtration increased after captopril administration but did not change after ibuprofen alone or in combination with captopril. Renal plasma flow increased with captopril alone and captopril plus ibuprofen but did not change after ibuprofen alone. Urine volume and Na excretion increased with captopril and decreased after ibuprofen; coadministration of ibuprofen attenuated the tubular effects produced by captopril alone. FELi, fractional delivery of solute to the distal nephron, and FELi-FENa, fractional distal reabsorption of solute, both significantly increased after captopril and decreased after ibuprofen but did not change with the combined regimen. (FELi-FENa)/FELi, fractional reabsorption of distally delivered Na, significantly decreased after captopril and increased after ibuprofen but remained unchanged after captopril plus ibuprofen. Thus captopril and ibuprofen have opposing effects on tubular Na and water handling, which are attenuated by the addition of the other drug. This interaction may have clinical relevance in patients with heart failure or hypertension, in whom captopril is used to enhance Na and water diuresis.", 
    "8": "A multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted among 306 black men and women with mild to moderate hypertension to determine effects of atenolol, captopril, and verapamil SR on measures of quality of life. Patients were randomly assigned to a stable or forced-dose titration sequence. After an 8-week treatment period, the rate of withdrawal from treatment because of adverse effects was low and did not differ by drug treatment group or titration level. Patients taking verapamil SR showed a significantly greater reduction in mean blood pressures than patients treated with atenolol or captopril. Along with absence of worsening on any quality of life total scale scores examined over the treatment period, we found either improvement or no change in the total scale scores for all three treatment groups. Among both male and female patients, comparisons between drug treatment groups showed no differences in degree of change on the total scale scores. In comparisons within each treatment group, improvement in scores of male patients after 8 weeks appeared among those taking atenolol in general well-being and physical symptoms reduction; among male patients taking captopril in general well-being, physical symptoms, and sexual performance; and among male patients receiving verapamil SR in scores in irritability, sleep, and the Digit Span test. Improvement in scores among female patients taking atenolol was found in scores on general well-being, physical symptoms, and sleep; among women taking captopril on general well-being, physical symptoms, and irritability; and among women taking verapamil SR on general well-being. Patients in all treatment groups improved on measures of visuomotor functioning. The research shows that with the three newer generation antihypertensive medications studied, blood pressure control was achieved during the treatment period without negative effects on quality of life scales, along with findings of improvement on some measures. Given the special clinical features of hypertension in black patients, the study underlines as well the potential and utility of systematic tracking of measures of quality of life, while monitoring blood pressures in this patient population.", 
    "9": "A double-blind, positively controlled, forced dose titration study comparing the efficacy and safety of atenolol, captopril, and verapamil sustained release as single agents in the treatment of black patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 114 mm Hg) was conducted. A total of 394 patients were randomized to one of the three therapies. Mean blood pressures during a 2- to 4-week placebo treatment period (baseline) ranged from 100.4 to 100.7 mm Hg diastolic and 151.7 to 152.5 mm Hg systolic for the three groups. Of the patients, 355 (of whom 345 had assessable data) completed the first treatment period, which consisted of therapy with either 50 mg/d of atenolol, 25 mg every 12 hours of captopril, or 240 mg/d of verapamil sustained release. During the second 4-week treatment period, which 319 patients completed (307 assessable), half of the patients had their antihypertensive medication increased and the other half continued the same dose. Goal blood pressure was defined as a supine diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a 10-mm Hg or greater drop in supine diastolic blood pressure from pretreatment levels. Atenolol, captopril, and verapamil sustained release therapy was associated with goal blood pressure achievement during the first treatment period 55.1%, 43.8%, and 65.2% of the time, respectively, and during the second treatment period 59.6%, 57.1%, and 73.0% of the time. Side effects were minimal and comparable for all three drugs.", 
    "10": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were fed low protein (6%) diets (LP rats), high protein (50%) diets (HP rats), or regular rat chow (approximately 16% protein) (control rats) and studied under anesthesia after 2 weeks. Dietary protein intake did not affect mean arterial pressure, but renal blood flow was increased in the HP rats and decreased in the LP rats compared with the control rats. Mesenteric blood flow was not significantly different in the three diet groups. Captopril (10 mg.kg-1 i.v.) had no effect on renal vascular resistance in the HP rat but did reduce the elevated renal vascular resistance seen in the LP rat. Meclofenamate (5 mg.kg-1 i.v.) did not significantly affect renal hemodynamics in either HP or LP rats. Finally, the HP rat exhibited resistance to the systemic pressor, renal, and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II. Captopril restored the systemic pressor and the mesenteric vasoconstrictor response but not the renal vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II. Meclofenamate, on the other hand, restored both the systemic pressor response and the renal vasoconstrictor response. Thus, in the LP rat, the vascular response to angiotensin II remains intact, and renal vasoconstriction appears to be mediated by angiotensin II. In contrast, in the HP rat, the renovascular response to angiotensin II is blunted apparently because of enhanced renal prostaglandin production. However, neither increased renal prostaglandin synthesis nor blunting of the renovascular response to angiotensin II appears to account for the chronic vasodilation seen in the HP rat.", 
    "11": "The Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) is an extensive program of research that has 3 components. (1) Two large double-blind randomized trials evaluate the effects of enalapril on mortality, morbidity and quality of life of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with overt congestive heart failure (CHF) (Treatment Trial in 2,500 patients) and without overt CHF (Prevention Trial in 4,600 patients). (2) Seven detailed sub-studies evaluate the effect of enalapril on a number of intermediate outcomes such as right and LV function and hemodynamics, LV mass and wall stress, hormones, arrhythmias, exercise capacity and quality of life in subsets of patients in the 2 large trials. (3) Finally, a registry of 6,336 patients with congestive heart failure or LV dysfunction is designed to describe the clinical course of an unselected group of patients. The rationale and design of a tiered approach to clinical trials that are large enough to provide reliable information on mortality and morbidity, yet provide relevant information on other endpoints, are described.", 
    "12": "Fifty patients with suspected renal artery stenosis (RAS) were studied with renal scintigraphy before and after administration of captopril. Twenty-three patients had RAS (greater than or equal to 75% RAS or greater than or equal to 50% RAS with poststenotic dilatation) and 27 had normal renal arteries at angiography. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were discontinued 24 hours prior to renal scintigraphy; all other medications were continued. Each patient was evaluated with a simplified captopril renal scintigraphic protocol: renal imaging after administration of 12 mCi (444 MBq) of technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), a 3-hour wait, oral administration of 50 mg of captopril, a 1-hour wait, and another scintigram obtained after administration of 12 mCi (444 MBq) of Tc-99m DTPA. Times of peak renal activity (Tmax) were determined from renal time-activity curves, and glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were calculated with the Gates technique. A Tmax greater than or equal to 11 minutes after injection or a GFR ratio (larger GFR/smaller GFR) greater than 1.5 enabled detection of RAS with 91% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 92% accuracy. Renal scintigraphy without captopril had only 43%-68% sensitivity in detecting RAS, depending on the criteria used.", 
    "13": "The rate of conversion of ramipril (Hoe 498), a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, to its active metabolite was compared with that of enalapril. After intravenous administration to rats, ramipril was very rapidly deesterified to its active moiety, ramiprilat. The ratio of the active metabolite level to the prodrug level in plasma at 5 min after administration was 10.7 for ramipril, which was about 5 times the ratio for enalapril. The in vitro conversion rates of ramipril were higher than those of enalapril in all rat tissue homogenates examined, including the liver, a main site of metabolism. The apparent Km values of ramipril and enalapril in the liver were 190 and 710 mumol/l, respectively, suggesting that ramipril has a higher affinity for esterase than enalapril. In conclusion, ramipril was superior to enalapril in efficiency of conversion to the active metabolite.", 
    "14": "We studied the effects of endothelin on the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Endothelin had a novel effect on angiotensin I conversion. When endothelin was added to pulmonary artery endothelial cells, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was enhanced about two-fold. The maximum stimulation was achieved at 10(-8) M of endothelin. This stimulatory effect was suppressed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such an enalapril. When the calcium antagonist, nifedipine, was incubated with 10(-8) M of endothelin, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II stimulated with endothelin was slightly suppressed by nifedipine. Enalapril (10(-6) M) completely inhibited the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the presence of endothelin. These results suggest that endothelin may play an important role in regulating vascular tone by modulating the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.", 
    "15": "We studied the effects of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells converted 1.22 nmol/min per dish [125I]angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but ANF suppressed the conversion by 0.475 nmol/min per dish. The maximum rate of inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity by ANF was 60% at 10(-6) mol/l ANF compared with control conditions. The amino acid fragments of ANF were studied to determine whether its specific structure was necessary for inhibiting ACE in endothelial cells. We found that atriopeptin II (fragment 5-27) inhibited ACE activity as much as ANF. Fragment 7-25 had the same rate of inhibition, but fragment 13-27 had no effect on the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. These results suggest that the amino acid sequence of Cys (7)-Cys (23) in ANF is important for the inhibition of ACE in pulmonary endothelial cells.", 
    "16": "The temporal blood pressure course and the diurnal profile of the renin-angiotensin system were examined in 13 patients with essential hypertension receiving hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril once daily. Blood samples were taken and blood pressure was measured before the habitual morning dose of hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril (at 8.00 a.m.) and at seven time points over the next 24 h. During the period of maximal effect of enalapril (from 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.), the increase in plasma renin concentration ranged from no change to an 800% increase. A negative correlation was observed between an increase in plasma renin and a decrease in immunoreactive plasma angiotensin II concentration (Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient = 0.83). Notably, the greatest changes in plasma renin and angiotensin II concentrations after enalapril were seen in those patients whose blood pressure fell most during the day. We conclude that hypertensive patients on long-term therapy with enalapril once daily vary widely in their between-dose biochemical response to the drug, and that there is a significant association between the responsiveness of the plasma renin-angiotensin system and the effect on 24 h blood pressure.", 
    "17": "We describe here a method of measuring angiotensin peptides and their carboxy-truncated metabolites in human plasma using N-terminal-directed antisera. Antisera raised against N-acetylated angiotensin (Ang) II and N-acetylated Ang III analogues were used to develop two radioimmunoassays. Extracted plasma samples were acetylated prior to separation of cross-reacting angiotensin peptides by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fractions were assayed with both antisera to obtain measurements for eight angiotensin peptides. Angiotensin levels measured in normal males were (fmol/ml plasma, mean +/- s.e.m., n = 14): Ang-(1-7) 1.0 +/- 0.2, Ang II 13.9 +/- 2.0, Ang-(1-9) less than 0.4, Ang I 19.5 +/- 2.4, Ang-(2-7) less than 1.1, Ang III 2.9 +/- 1.0, Ang-(2-9) less than 2.1, Ang-(2-10) 2.4 +/- 0.8. Hypertensive patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy (n = 8) had an increase in Ang I to 187.3 +/- 107.2 fmol/ml (P = 0.002), and a reduction in Ang II to 4.8 +/- 1.2 fmol/ml (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, these patients showed a ninefold increase in Ang-(1-7) to 9.7 +/- 4.3 fmol/ml (P less than 0.001), indicating a role for prolylendopeptidase in the metabolism of Ang I in vivo. These N-terminal assays have demonstrated that carboxy-truncated metabolites of Ang I and Ang II make little contribution to plasma angiotensin peptides, except during ACE inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, these antisera allow the measurement of Ang I and Ang II in the same radioimmunoassay of fractions from HPLC, providing a highly reliable estimate of the Ang II:Ang I ratio.", 
    "18": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was measured by fluorimetry in the plasma, lung, heart, aorta and kidney (cortex and medulla) of 3-, 5-, 8- and 11-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and compared with that of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). In the plasma, lung and kidney (cortex and medulla), ACE activity was lower in SHR than in WKY. This was evident as early as the age of 3 weeks. In contrast, there were no differences between SHR and WKY in the aorta and the heart. Age-related variations in ACE activities differed in each tissue and in both groups of rats, but no major modifications were correlated with the development of hypertension. A binding assay was performed with [3H]ramiprilat; affinity (KD) and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) were determined in plasma and tissues of 3-week-old SHR and WKY. The KD values were identical in the two groups but Bmax was lower in all SHR tissues except in the heart; these results might be related to the decrease in ACE activity. Our results probably reflect genetic differences in ACE activity between SHR and WKY, and suggest that ACE regulatory mechanisms act differently in each tissue.", 
    "19": "The effect of enalapril on albumin excretion rate was studied in two groups of age- and sex-matched Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients, aged 15-20 years, with persistent microalbuminuria greater than 20 micrograms/min. Group 1 contained six patients with systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 75th percentile for age and sex, group 2 six normotensive patients. Enalapril (10-20 mg/day) was given for six months. Albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, blood pressure at rest and during exercise, and angiotensin converting enzyme activity were measured before, after three weeks' and six months' treatment and six months after treatment withdrawal. Albumin excretion rate decreased in all patients after three weeks' (mean decreases 55% in group 1, 65% in group 2) and six months' treatment (35% in group 1, 61% in group 2). Systolic blood pressure remained unchanged in both groups. Diastolic pressure was reduced after three weeks in group 1 (p = 0.001). No reduction in increment in systolic pressure during exercise test occurred in any group during treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity decreased in all patients after three weeks (p = 0.001) and six months (p = 0.003). This correlated to the decrease in albumin excretion rate after three weeks (r = 0.79, p = 0.05) and six months (r = 0.59, p = 0.04). HbA1c, mean blood glucose and glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged during the study in both groups. Renal plasma flow tended to increase after three weeks' and six months' treatment in group 2 (p = 0.06, respectively) but not in group 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "1. Eight nephrotic patients were studied in order to evaluate the effects of acute changes in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate on renal solute and water handling, in the absence of plasma volume expansion. 2. The subjects were studied first after the administration of captopril, a manoeuvre that increased renal plasma flow without a significant change in glomerular filtration rate, and a second time after receiving combined therapy with captopril and ibuprofen, a manoeuvre that decreased glomerular filtration rate without a significant change in renal plasma flow. 3. After captopril therapy, despite the increase in renal plasma flow, there was no significant change in proximal sodium reabsorption (as estimated from fractional lithium reabsorption), urine volume or urine osmolality. 4. The decrease in glomerular filtration rate observed after the administration of captopril plus ibuprofen was associated with decreases in fractional excretion of sodium and urine volume, and an increase in urine osmolality. The changes in these parameters of tubular function were proportionate to the changes in glomerular filtration rate. Fractional proximal sodium reabsorption increased substantially. 5. These observations suggest that, in the absence of plasma volume expansion, an increase in renal plasma flow does not increase sodium or water excretion by the nephrotic kidney. Moreover, during acute decreases in glomerular filtration rate, glomerulotubular balance appears to be disrupted, resulting in disproportionately high rates of proximal tubule sodium reabsorption.", 
    "21": "Rabbits were bilaterally nephrectomized for 24 h or received an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor chronically (5 days) before an acute experiment. Conductance responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) (0.25, 0.75, and 2.25 Hz) and norepinephrine (NE) administration (0.2, 0.6, and 1.8 micrograms ia) were determined from simultaneous blood pressure and iliac blood flow measurements. Conductance responses to SNS were significantly reduced in nephrectomized (44, 26, and 20%) and chronic ACE inhibition (39, 31, and 24%) groups compared with normal controls, whereas conductance responses to NE were unchanged. Continuous infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II) for 24 h restored the depressed responses to SNS in nephrectomized and chronic ACE inhibition groups compared with normal controls but did not change conductance responses to NE. Acute ACE inhibition did not affect the conductance responses to SNS or NE compared with controls. Vascular tissue ACE activity was inhibited to a similar degree (50%) in both acute and chronic ACE inhibition groups compared with normal rabbits. Sodium depletion increased the conductance responses to SNS (30 and 24% at 0.25 and 0.75 Hz, respectively), but responses to NE were not affected. Chronic ACE inhibition significantly attenuated the conductance responses to SNS and slightly decreased responses to NE in sodium-depleted rabbits. Thus, in the anesthetized rabbit, the renin-angiotensin system potentiates the effect of SNS, presumably by ANG II acting at a prejunctional site, and this effect of ANG II appears to be long term in nature. Therefore, the renin-angiotensin system exerts a physiological role in the control of blood pressure in addition to the ability of this system to support arterial pressure in pathophysiological states.", 
    "22": "Alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic receptor-mediated contractile responses have been well characterized in the genitourinary tissues of several mammalian species. The present study characterizes the in vitro contractile responsiveness of canine bladder and prostate to the peptides, bradykinin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II. All preparations contracted to 0.15 M KCl. Bradykinin elicited contractile responses in both prostate (10(-10) to 10(-7) M) and bladder (10(-10) to 10(-6) M). In both tissues, angiotensin II produced minimal responses and angiotensin I failed to elicit contractions. The potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilic acid [MK-422] (10(-6) M) increased the contractile response to the prostate to bradykinin two-fold while having no effect on bradykinin-induced contractions in the bladder. Enalaprilic acid did not affect the contractile responses of the two tissues to angiotensin I or angiotensin II. The canine urogenital tissue contractile responses to bradykinin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II may have relevance to human physiology. Previous studies have demonstrated that human prostatic tissue, specifically benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), has the highest concentration of ACE activity of tissues evaluated. Bradykinin is a potent peptidergic contractile agent in canine bladder and prostate. The activity of enalaprilic acid to amplify the bradykinin-induced contractions in the canine prostate is consistent with high levels of ACE in the tissue. These data confirm the sensitivity of the canine prostate to bradykinin and report for the first time, the ability of bradykinin to induce contractions in the prostate. These studies support the possibility that bradykinin may be involved in mediating micturition under normal and pathological states such as infravesical obstruction secondary to BPH. Furthermore, the results from these investigations in canine urogenital tissues, if applicable to humans, suggest that urinary function be closely monitored in patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "23": "Congestive heart failure is associated with blunted cardiac adrenergic responsiveness, clinically manifested by diminished chronotropic, inotropic, and lusitropic responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Recent advances in our understanding of the multiple components of the beta-adrenergic receptor complex and of the mechanisms by which these components interact with each other have led to insights beyond the mere evaluation of beta-receptors to account for adrenergic hyporesponsiveness in congestive heart failure. In addition to a reduction in beta-adrenergic receptors, the failing heart appears to show key abnormalities in the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that link the beta-receptor to its biochemical effector. A reduction in the stimulatory protein and in the extent to which the stimulatory protein is linked to the beta-receptor are demonstrable in peripheral circulating lymphocytes and in cardiac tissue. These abnormalities are at least partially reversible.", 
    "24": "1. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of quinapril and its active metabolite quinaprilat were studied in 20 subjects with renal function varying from normal to severe renal failure, during the approach to and at steady-state, and for 72 h after cessation of quinapril 20 mg orally for 7 days. 2. The apparent oral plasma clearance of quinaprilat (dose of quinapril equivalent/AUC of quinaprilat) was directly related to creatinine clearance (CLCr). The predicted apparent oral clearance of quinaprilat was zero when CLCr was zero, suggesting minimal extrarenal elimination. 3. Peak and trough concentrations of quinaprilat, and its apparent elimination half-life, varied inversely with CLCr. 4. Trough concentrations of quinaprilat showed no accumulation between 2 and 7 days, even in severe renal impairment. 5. There was a weak relationship between the oral plasma clearance of quinapril and CLCr. 6. ACE inhibition was marked and prolonged in all subjects, with 50% inhibition at 2.7 +/- 1.9% ng ml-1 of quinaprilat. The time for which ACE inhibition was greater than 90% was related inversely to CLCr. 7. Aldosterone concentrations and plasma renin activity responded in a predictable way, but with no clear relationship To CLCr. 8. Atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were not affected by quinapril administration. 9. Glomerular filtration rate, as measured by Tc99mDTPA clearance, was not affected by quinapril administration. 10. Blood pressure at steady-state decreased significantly in the subjects with hypertension. The changes in blood pressure were not related to renal function. 11. These results suggest that the dosage rate of quinapril may have to be altered in renal impairment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The present study was performed to determine if the renin-angiotensin system was involved in regulating cardiac cell growth in vivo. The pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy model that develops in abdominal aorta-constricted rats was studied. At 7 and 15 days after abdominal aorta constriction, rats developed significant left ventricular hypertrophy. The increase in left ventricular mass was completely prevented in animals fed the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate (0.2 mg/ml) in their drinking water. Cardiac afterload was the same in both groups of animals in that carotid artery pressures were not different in conscious awake aortic-constricted animals receiving and not receiving enalapril. These data suggest a direct growth effect of angiotensin II on the left ventricle and indicate a role for the renin-angiotensin system in the cardiac hypertrophy that develops in response to pressure overload. The presence and chamber localization of angiotensinogen mRNA was determined using Northern hybridization and S1 nuclease mapping analysis. Angiotensinogen mRNA, as determined by dot-blot hybridization analysis, was significantly increased in hypertrophied left ventricles at both 7 and 15 days after the surgery, when compared with sham-operated controls. The activity of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, as indexed by plasma renin activity was increased at 1 day following surgery [6.0 +/- 2.0 ng.ml-1.h-1 angiotensin I (control) vs. 41.8 +/- 10.9 ng.ml-1.h-1 angiotensin I (experimental)], but returned to control values by day 3 postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Hypertensive cardiac disease shows early alteration of left ventricular diastolic filling, characterized by a longer isovolumetric relaxation period and by an altered E/A ratio on the mitral spectral Doppler. We chose ten hypertensive patients who had left ventricular hypertrophy, but no left ventricular dilatation or mitral valve insufficiency and had a good left ventricular shortening fraction (greater than 26%). After the washout period we studied each of the above-mentioned parameters before and after the acute administration of nifedipine, dinitrate isosorbide, and captopril. While captopril and dinitrate isosorbide induced a prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation time and an impairment of the E/A ratio in mitral spectral Doppler (i.e., left ventricular filling), nifedipine induced an improvement in both parameters. The three drugs also induced a similar reduction in systemic blood pressure values (i.e., similar afterload). We therefore suggest that changes in diastolic function in hypertrophied cardiac fibers, induced by nifedipine, may be the result of a double action: one mediated by hemodynamic changes, the other directly affecting the cellular calcium ion exchange.", 
    "27": "Recent studies on pathogenetic mechanisms, supplemented by findings in clinical trials point the way to a logical approach to acute evolving myocardial infarction. This is designed in the earliest stage to limit infarction through reduction in myocardial oxygen demands, improvement in collateral blood supply and dissolution of coronary thrombus, to prevent in a later stage coronary reocclusion through administration of antiplatelet agents, and then to prevent infarct expansion through reduction in ventricular wall tension throughout the period of repair. Application of such an approach holds the promise of reducing infarct size and all the complications of infarction, as well as short and long-term mortality. The approach is active and aggressive, and contrasts with the approach applied a decade ago, where infarction was accepted as inevitable and therapies were reserved for managing its complications.", 
    "28": "Cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy, hyperplasia of connective tissue, abnormal peripheral circulation and metabolic changes in the cardiac fibre and in the smooth muscle cell as a consequence of mechanic overload are described in variable proportions in heart failure. These changes in turn are essential factors for progression of the disease. Results of early drug intervention in patients with few or no symptoms suggest that decrease of mechanic overload by vasodilator therapy slows down the progression of the disease. In late stages, treatment with diuretics and vasodilators improves the symptoms and the outcome of heart failure. Diuretics alone and inotropic positive substances bring about some improvement of symptoms and maximal oxygen consumption, but they have no favourable effect on the outcome. Positive inotropic substances remain restricted to late forms of heart failure, in which they seem to ameliorate symptoms but have a rather unfavourable effect on the outcome. The role of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin is well defined. This is not the case for newer calcium-channel blockers from the dihydropyridine group, of beta blockers, of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and of substances with partial beta agonist and partial beta blocking activity. These drugs must still be classified as experimental agents for the treatment of heart failure.",

    "30": "To study the haemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of nisoldipine (2 X 10 mg) vs captopril (3 X 25 mg), 24 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II and III) due to coronary artery disease were treated in a randomized double-blind trial over 3 months. Both drugs were well tolerated. Clinical status was similarly improved in both groups, nisoldipine exerted an additional antiischaemic effect. Nisoldipine lowered the mean arterial pressure and capillary wedge pressure acutely and also after long-term treatment. The increase in cardiac index and stroke volume index, however, which was pronounced after acute administration, was no longer present after 3 months of therapy at rest and was abolished during exercise. Norepinephrine plasma concentration increased after the first dose, plasma renin activity did not change, and aldosterone plasma concentration showed a small insignificant decrease. Urine concentrations of norepinephrine and vasopressin were slightly elevated after the 3-month therapy. After captopril, mean arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased acutely and at follow up. Cardiac index and stroke volume index increased significantly only during exercise at follow-up. Plasma renin activity was significantly elevated and aldosterone plasma concentration only slightly lowered. In contrast to what was seen with nisoldipine, plasma norepinephrine concentration and urine catecholamine and vasopressin concentrations remained unchanged. In conclusion, the pronounced haemodynamic effects seen after the first dose of nisoldipine are mostly abolished after long-term treatment, probably due to neurohumoral counterregulation. The haemodynamic response to captopril is complete only after long-term treatment, without evidence of activation of the neurohumoral systems.", 
    "31": "Opioid peptides are present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and their levels are reported to change in some pathologic conditions. However, less is known about their degradation in CSF. In the present study, human CSF was found to contain aminopeptidase activity which hydrolyzed alanyl-, leucyl- and arginyl-naphthylamides in a ratio of 100:28:27. Twelve CSF samples hydrolyzed alanyl-2-naphthylamide and degraded Met5-enkephalin (N-terminal hydrolysis) at rates of 188 +/- 38 and 420 +/- 79 pmol/min/mL respectively. Further, the distribution of alanyl-naphthylamidase activity in individual samples (39-437 pmol/min/mL) was closely correlated with that of Met5-enkephalin degradation (37-833 pmol/min/mL). Both alanyl-naphthylamidase and enkephalin degradation were optimal at pH 7.0 to 7.5 and were inhibited by aminopeptidase inhibitors amastatin (IC50 = 20 nM), bestatin (4-7 microM) and puromycin (30-35 microM). Conversely, degradation was unaffected by inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (phosphoramidon), carboxypeptidase N (MERGETPA) or angiotensin converting enzyme (captopril). The Km of Met5-enkephalin for the CSF aminopeptidase activity was 201 +/- 19 microM (N = 4). Rates of hydrolysis of the Tyr1-Gly2 bond of larger opioid peptides decreased with increasing peptide length. Pooled, concentrated CSF hydrolyzed Leu5-enkephalin, dynorphin A fragments [1-7], [1-10] and [1-13] and dynorphin A at rates of 2.05 +/- 0.27, 1.27 +/- 0.18, 0.94 +/- 0.06, 0.55 +/- 0.14 and 0.16 +/- 0.03 nmol/min/mL respectively. When analyzed by rocket-immunoelectrophoresis against antisera to aminopeptidase M (EC 3.4.11.2), the concentrated CSF formed an immunoprecipitate which could be stained histochemically for alanyl-naphthylamidase activity. These data are consistent with a significant role for aminopeptidase M activity in the degradation of low molecular weight opioid peptides in human CSF.", 
    "32": "Conversion of the octapeptide dynorphin (Dyn) A-(1-8) to Leu5-enkephalin (LE) by endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP-24.15) in vivo was examined using the technique of ventriculocisternal perfusion. Peptides were administered intracerebroventricularly in the presence or absence of the EP-24.15 inhibitor N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (cFPAAF-pAB) via cannulae placed into the lateral ventricle of urethane-anesthetized rats. The concentration of Dyn-like peptides and LE within the CSF was monitored by radioimmunoassay in samples of CSF taken from a second cannula placed in the cisterna magna. In the absence of inhibitor, less than 5% of the Dyn A-(1-8) administered was recovered in CSF. Immunoreactive LE, which is normally not found in CSF, increased rapidly in content following Dyn A-(1-8) infusion, an observation suggesting that the larger peptide is converted to LE. When the inhibitor cFPAAF-pAB was coadministered with Dyn A-(1-8), the concentration of immunoreactive Dyn A-(1-8) after 5 min was 40 times higher than that found in the absence of inhibitor. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril reduced the degradation of Dyn A-(1-8) to a much lesser degree. The inhibitor of EP-24.15 also afforded some protection of other Dyn-like peptides. No EP-24.15 activity was found in rat CSF, whereas high activity was found in the choroid plexus. Taken together, these data clearly indicate that an ectoenzyme form of EP-24.15 rapidly converts intracerebroventricularly administered Dyn-like peptides to LE.", 
    "33": "Antihypertensive drugs may lower blood pressure through very different mechanisms, initially as well as during chronic use. This article is a review of the immediate hemodynamic changes induced by a beta blocker (visacor), an alpha-receptor blocker (doxazosin), two calcium antagonists (tiapamil and nisoldipine), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindoprilat), two double-acting compounds (dilevalol and carvedilol), and placebo studied in 126 patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension. The patient populations of the different treatment groups were comparable. The invasive hemodynamic technique, including intraarterial blood pressure (BP) recording and measurements of cardiac output by cardiogreen, was the same in all studies. All antihypertensive compounds examined induced a rapid reduction in blood pressure both at rest and during exercise, while no significant changes occurred in the placebo group. This review shows the scope of hemodynamic responses, ranging from peripheral vasodilation to a reduction of heart rate and blood flow. Furthermore, different counterregulatory effects blunting the immediate BP reduction are demonstrated.",

At pH below 7.0 zinc ions added to the reaction mixture increase the enzyme activity; this stimulating effect is changed to inhibition with a further rise in Zn2+ concentration. It was shown that the dissociation constant for the enzyme--Zn2+ complex and the \"optimal\" concentrations of Zn2+ needed for the manifestation of the maximal enzymatic activity depend on the nature of the substrate at all pH values studied.", 
    "35": "Thirty-seven essential hypertensives received placebo for 3 weeks followed by nifedipine retard (n = 14) or enalapril (n = 13) or doxazosin (n = 10) as monotherapy for 6 weeks and attended study days to evaluate the effects of placebo, first dose, and chronic (1-6 weeks) treatment. On each study day, pressor responses to i.v. infusions of phenylephrine (PE) and angiotensin II (AII) were measured 1.5-3 h after drug administration and the derived PD20 values (dose required to increase mean blood pressure by 20 mm Hg) compared. Each treatment produced comparable reductions in BP. Nifedipine significantly attenuated the pressor responses to AII and PE: for AII, the mean PD20 (ng/kg/min) increased from 8.2 (placebo) to 9.9 (first dose), 13.9 (1 week), and 17.4 (6 weeks). Pressor responsiveness to both AII and PE was unchanged following enalapril: for PE, the mean PD20 (micrograms/kg/min) was 2.1 (placebo), 1.5 (first dose), and 1.5 (6 weeks). Doxazosin produced rightward shifts of the PE pressor dose-response curves but had no effect on responses to AII. The relationship between the simultaneous BP and HR changes during the infusion of PE was used as an index of cardiac baroreflex activity. In contrast to enalapril and doxazosin, which had no effect, nifedipine reduced the slope of the HR/BP relationship from -0.62 (placebo) to -0.38 (first dose) and -0.31 beats/min/mm Hg (6 weeks). For comparable reductions in BP, doxazosin only affects adrenergic mechanisms whereas nifedipine affects both adrenergic and non-adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction. The ACE inhibitor enalapril had no effect on pressor responses to AII and PE.", 
    "36": "We used cultured rabbit tracheal epithelium to determine the effect of mammalian-derived tachykinin on airway ciliary activity and its modulation by neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP). Neurokinin A (NKA) caused dose-dependent increases in ciliary beat frequency (CBF), as measured by a photoelectric method, with the maximal increase from the baseline 15.7 +/- 1.7% (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01), whereas substance P (SP) had no effect. The NKA-induced increase in CBF was not inhibited by phentolamine, propranolol, or atropine, but it was abolished by the tachykinin antagonist [D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9]SP. Pretreatment of tissue with thiorphan (10(-5) M), a NEP inhibitor, had little effect on CBF responses to NKA; however, it significantly potentiated the responses to SP (14.9 +/- 3.0%, p less than 0.01). Other peptidase inhibitors, including captopril, bestatin, and leupeptin, did not alter the tachykinin-induced CBF response, suggesting that angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidases, and serine proteinases do not modulate ciliary activity in response to tachykinins. These results suggest that NKA increases CBF by acting directly on tachykinin receptors and that NEP may play a role in modulating the tachykinin-induced stimulatory effects on CBF.", 
    "37": "The more potent inhibitory activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was excised from a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) preparation of Bacillus stearothermophilus by heating at 120 degrees C in 1 M AcOH-20 mM HCl, as compared with GAPDH preparations of yeast and pig. Sufficient excision of B. stearothermophilus ACE inhibitors required a longer proteolysis time of 60 min. Two inhibitors were then purified by gel-permeation and reverse-phase chromatographies. One of the B. stearothermophilus ACE inhibitors BG-1, was the GAPDH peptide 68-77 (Gly-Lys-Glu-Ile-Ile-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Arg, IC50: 32 microM). Another inhibitor, BG-2 (Gly-Lys-Met-Val-Lys-Val-Val-Ser-Trp-Tyr, IC50: 6 microM), correspond to GAPDH peptide 304-313. These sequences were quite different from those of vertebrate GAPDH peptides and the venom peptide family with ACE inhibitory activity. BG-2 was found to be a non-competitive type inhibitor, differing from many natural peptide inhibitors. Thus, B. stearothermophilus GAPDH seemed to be a good source of new type ACE inhibitors, in addition to the advantages due to its thermophilic property.", 
    "38": "During recent years, ACE inhibitors have been employed to an increasing extent in the long-term treatment of arterial hypertension. As part of the investigation of arterial hypertension, the captopril test, with administration of a small oral dose of captopril and registration of the blood pressure and pulse during the subsequent period, is employed. During this test, two cases of marked fall in blood pressure accompanied by symptoms of inadequate cerebral circulation were observed. Both of these patients were subsequently submitted to digital subtraction angiography of the vessels of the neck and both found to have unilateral stenosis of the carotid artery. It is concluded that, particularly in elderly hypertensive patients, ACE inhibitor treatment should always be initiated during controlled conditions. Stethoscopic examination of the carotid arteries should always be performed.", 
    "39": "To determine the effects of the opioid peptides, beta-endorphin and dynorphin A, on airway smooth muscle function and its possible modulation by tissue peptidases, we studied canine bronchial segments under isometric conditions in vitro. Addition of beta-endorphin or dynorphin A did not alter the resting tension. However, beta-endorphin (10(-6) M) but not dynorphin A decreased the contractile responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0.5-40 Hz). This effect was dose-dependent and reversed by naloxone. In contrast, acetylcholine-induced contractions were not affected by these opioids. The beta-endorphin-induced inhibition of the contractile responses to EFS was not augmented by peptidase inhibitors such as thiorphan, captopril, bestatin and leupeptin. These results suggest that beta-endorphin prejunctionally inhibits parasympathetic muscle contraction, and that endogenous peptidases do not play a modulatory role in this effect of beta-endorphin.", 
    "40": "A pilot study was performed to assess the short-term effects of intravenous captopril on anginal threshold and systemic and coronary hemodynamics in patients with stable angina pectoris. Twelve patients with documented coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris and normal left ventricular function were studied by an incremental atrial pacing stress test before and after intravenous captopril (n = 8) or placebo (n = 4). There were no significant differences in the extent of coronary disease or left ventricular function between the 2 groups and resting plasma-renin levels were normal. Captopril increased the time to angina (14 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 5 minutes, p less than 0.05), increased heart rate at development of angina (126 +/- 7 to 142 +/- 7 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and tended to increase coronary blood flow (229 +/- 154 to 296 +/- 259 ml/min, p = 0.11) and decrease coronary vascular resistance (53 +/- 10 to 47 +/- 3 dynes s cm-5/1,000, p = 0.11) at peak stress without alteration in systemic hemodynamics. No significant changes were seen after placebo administration. Therefore, intravenous captopril appears to cause a short-term increase of coronary vascular reserve, and anginal threshold in patients with chronic stable angina. This effect appears to be independent of inhibition of the systemic renin-angiotensin system or systemic hemodynamic changes.", 
    "41": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method capable of separating a large number of C- and N-terminal degradation fragments of dynorphin A (1-17) (dyn 1-17) in 1 h has been developed. The system has been applied to study the metabolism profiles of various dyn 1-17-derived peptides following in vitro incubation with rat striatum and spinal cord nerve terminal membranes. In addition to the removal of the N-terminal amino acid Tyr, major sites of cleavage between the following amino acids could be established: Leu5-Arg6 in dyn 1-7 (formation of dyn 1-5); Arg6-Arg7 and Leu5-Arg6 in dyn 1-8 (formation of dyn 1-6 and dyn 1-5, respectively); Arg7-Ile8 in dyn 1-9 (formation of dyn 1-7) and Arg9-Pro10 in dyn 1-10 (formation of dyn 1-9). Studies with inhibitors of the enzymes involved show that dyn 1-5 is formed directly from dyn 1-8 via an endopeptidase insensitive to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor MK 422 acting on the scissile Leu5-Arg6 bond in dyn 1-8. The method circumvents the use of [3H]Tyr-labelled dynorphins, which have the inherent drawback that fragments lacking the N-terminal Tyr cannot be detected. Owing to the high resolution, also for the larger dynorphins dyn 1-14, dyn 1-15 and dyn 1-16, the chromatographic system should prove especially useful in the elucidation of the enzymolysis pattern of dyn 1-17. Furthermore, the method offers a way to evaluate simultaneously the selectivity of new enzyme inhibitors for several cleavage sites in the same assay.", 
    "42": "Increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of salt retention and edema formation in congestive heart failure. The present study evaluates the effects of chronic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme on the response to infusion of exogenous atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in salt-retaining rats with chronic arteriovenous (a-v) fistula, an experimental model of high-output congestive heart failure. Administration of ANF in incremental doses (5-50 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) to Inactin-anesthetized, sham-operated control rats resulted in dose-dependent increases in urine flow, sodium excretion, and glomerular filtration rate, and significant decreases in mean arterial blood pressure. These effects of atrial peptide were markedly attenuated in salt-retaining rats with a-v fistula. However, chronic oral treatment with the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril restored the natriuretic response of sodium-retaining rats with a-v fistula to high doses of ANF. At a dose of 50 micrograms.kg-1.h-1, fractional excretion of Na (FENa) in a-v fistula rats given enalapril was 4.0 +/- 0.5%, which was significantly greater than that in a-v fistula rats without enalapril (0.5 +/- 0.4%, P less than 0.05) and not different from the response in sham-control rats (4.9 +/- 0.7%). The improvement in the natriuretic response after enalapril was not associated with a significant increase in GFR and occurred despite a decrease in mean arterial pressure. Moreover, chronic enalapril treatment did not significantly alter the plasma levels of immunoreactive ANF in either the sham controls or in the rats with a-v fistula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There was no difference between the treatments in loss of clinical signs. Visual analogue scale and Likert scores indicated that breathlessness was less severe with xamoterol, but there was no difference in exercise duration or total work done. Xamoterol reduced maximum exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure, did not affect the number of ventricular premature beats after exercise, showed no arrhythmogenic activity, and had variable (agonist and antagonist) effects on 24 h heart rate.

Both spontaneous and potassium-stimulated release were tested after various in vitro incubation times (1, 3 or 5 hr). The potassium-stimulated release of ACh from slices of 28-month rats was decreased by 53% when tested after incubating the slices 1 hr. The age-related differences in ACh release lessened if the slices were incubated for longer times (3 or 5 hr) before monitoring release. The spontaneous release of ACh was similar among the slices from both age-groups and at all times points monitored. When the neostriatal slices were incubated in medium supplemented with deuterated choline, the release of both the endogenous and newly synthesized ACh from slices of 28-month rats was decreased by 33% when tested after a 1-hr incubation, but was again similar to that released from slices of 10-month rats when tested after a 3-hr incubation. Choline release from slices of the 28-month rats was similar to that released from the slices of the 10-month rats when acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was inhibited during the release incubation. In slices with intact AChE activity, however, the age-related difference in choline release was similar to that observed for ACh release when AChE was inhibited. That is, when AChE activity was intact, the potassium-stimulated choline release from slices of 28-month rats was less than that released from slices of 10-month rats when release was tested after a 1-hr incubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Renal function recovered completely in both cases upon discontinuation of enalapril.

The distances between the binding functions in both crystal structures are in agreement with the experimental results for the hypertension drug captopril and the enzyme substrate hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine. The modified peptide skeletons of both inhibitors adopt extended conformations with the proline amide bond trans. Crystallographic data have been used to determine the coordination geometry for zinc-sulfhydryl and zinc-carbonyl interactions. Coordination distances and bond angles are found to be different from values assumed in models of the angiotensin converting enzyme active site. No preferred torsion angles for a zinc-sulfhydryl inhibitor interaction can be identified. Superposition of the crystallographic structures of four ACE ligands shows that the observed extended conformations place the pharmacophores, zinc atom ligand, carbonyl oxygen atom, and carboxyl group, in juxtaposition and provide an alternative model for the interaction of ligands with the ACE active site.",

Both captopril and enalapril did not affect ethanol-induced lesions. While captopril significantly protected against oxyphenbutazone-induced lesions, enalapril aggravated the lesions. This difference is probably due to the lack of the protective sulfhydryl group in the chemical structure of enalapril.", 
    "49": "The effects of a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, delapril hydrochloride, (delapril) on renal function, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and kallikrein-kinin prostaglandin systems were studied in 10 hypertensive patients. After 4 to 12 months (7.6 +/- 0.9 [SE]) of treatment with 15-60 mg/day (36 +/- 6.8) of delapril (b.i.d.), mean arterial pressure was decreased from 126 +/- 3.0 to 110 +/- 4.4 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Although renal blood flow (RBF), assessed by PAH clearance and hematocrit, was increased from 437 +/- 51 to 490 +/- 49 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and renal vascular resistance was decreased (p less than 0.05), glomerular filtration rate, measured by endogenous creatinine clearance, did not change significantly. Thus, filtration fraction was reduced (p less than 0.01). Plasma renin activity was increased from 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 4.4 +/- 1.1 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.01). Plasma aldosterone concentration tended to decrease (p less than 0.1), and urinary aldosterone excretion showed on significant change. Although urinary kallikrein and prostaglandin E2 excretions were increased (p less than 0.05), urinary thromboxane B2 excretions was reduced (p less than 0.05). In addition, the changes in RBF were significantly correlated with those in urinary PGE2 excretion (r = 0.63, p less than 0.05). These results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of delapril is multifactorial and that the improvement of RBF seen during delapril administration in the present study may be partly due to the suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the activation of kallikrein-kinin-prostaglandin system.", 
    "50": "The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) (captopril, 50 mg/kg/day) on proteinuria (UProt), urinary aldosterone (UAldoV), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma angiotensinogen concentration (PAC), urinary sodium (UNaV), serum total protein, and body weight was studied for 21 days in an experimental nephrotic syndrome (NS) model induced in rats by a single injection (15 mg/100g) of puromycin aminonucleoside (PA). The effect of captopril on control rats without NS was also characterized. In control rats, captopril increased PRC and PRA, and decreased PAC; it had no effect on UNaV, UAldoV, UProt, total serum protein and body weight. In rats with NS, captopril had no effect on sodium retention, hypoproteinemia, and UProt; it abolished the increased UaldoV and favored weight loss. Captopril also rose PRA and PRC, and decreased PAC in PA-nephrotic rats; these changes were similar to those produced by captopril in control rats. The mortality rate was higher in nephrotic rats treated with captopril (37%) than in untreated nephrotic rats (13%). It is concluded that captopril has no beneficial effects on the course on NS induced by PA during the first 21 days, and supports the contention that sodium retention is not related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity in these rats.", 
    "51": "We compared the reactivity of pulmonary vessels to bradykinin (BK) and angiotensin I (AI) in normal and chronically hypoxic rats; the latter have pulmonary hypertension and muscularized pulmonary arterioles. These peptides are respectively inactivated and activated by the angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) on pulmonary endothelium. Isolated lungs were perfused at a constant flow rate when changes in pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) reflect changes in vascular resistance. Dose-response curves to BK (1 ng-10 micrograms) were derived during normoxia and pre-constriction by hypoxia; BK both decreased and increased vascular resistance, i.e. vasodilation and vasoconstriction. In normal rats only constriction was seen in normoxia, which reflected low basal vascular tone, whereas in chronically hypoxic rats there was only dilatation which reflected high basal vascular tone. In hypoxia in normal rats, low doses caused dilatation, high doses constriction; in chronically hypoxic rats there was again only dilatation which was larger than in controls. After the ACE-inhibitor captopril, constriction was exaggerated in control rats in both normoxia and hypoxia and took place in chronically hypoxic rats after high doses in both normoxia and hypoxia; oedema often followed. Dose-response curves to AI (1 ng-micrograms) in normoxia showed greatly enhanced pressor responses in chronically hypoxic compared with normal rats, probably attributable to increased sensitivity to angiotensin II (AII) rather than enhanced conversion of AI to AII. Captopril caused a proportionate reduction in responses in both groups of rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Glomerular filtration rate was decreased and filtration fraction was increased in rats with proximal aortic constriction. Low and high salt intakes had no effect on glomerular filtration and filtration fraction. Treatment with angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor increased the glomerular filtration rate and reduced the filtration fraction in rats with proximal aortic constriction to the same levels as in control rats. Serum levels of angiotensin II were about the same in rats with proximal aortic constriction as in control rats. Conclusion. The renovascular hypertension in proximal aortic constriction is influenced by locally formed angiotension II but not by alterations in salt intake.", 
    "53": "A changed exocrine pancreatic secretion could be a pathogenetic factor of an acute pancreatitis after administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors. In six conscious dogs with gastric and duodenal Thomas fistulas we studied the effect of an intravenous (iv.) bolus injection of 10 mg enalaprilat, an intraduodenal (id.) bolus injection of 20 and 40 mg enalapril (e.), and 0.15 M NaCl (20 ml iv., resp., id.) on pancreatic bicarbonate- and protein output in response to secretin (20.5 pmol/kg bw/h and caerulein (29.6 pmol/kg bw/h). Arterial blood pressure and heart rate we also measured. The iv. and id. injection of enalapril(at) significantly increased heart rate by 28% after 10 mg of e. iv. [peak 101 +/- 11 beats/min, N = 6, X +/- SEM] and by 13 resp. 37% after 20 resp. 40 mg e. id. [peak 89 +/- 4, resp., 108 +/- 7 beats/min] as compared to control [peak 79 +/- 5 beats/min]. Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased by 6% after 10 mg e. iv. [lowest value 121 +/- 2 mm Hg] and by 8% and 9% after 20 and 40 mg e. id., respectively, [lowest value 119 +/- 2, resp., 118 +/- 1 mm Hg] as compared to control [lowest value 129 +/- 1 mm Hg]. The applied enalapril(at) doses had no significant effect on hormonal stimulated pancreatic bicarbonate- and protein output. The results confirmed the well known effects of enalapril(at) on heart rate and on arterial blood pressure. Beyond that the results exposed that therapeutical doses of enalapril(at) had no significant effect on exocrine pancreatic secretion. Conclusion of this study is that a pathogenetic role of pancreatic exocrine secretion in the ace-inhibitors and the acute pancreatitis induced by ace-inhibitors is unlikely.", 
    "54": "Reactions of amino acid phosphoorganic derivatives with angiotensin-converting enzyme (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase) were studied. Substitution of the amino acid carboxyl group by HS- or P(O) (OH)2-groups did not cause the enzyme considerable inhibition. The enzymatic activity was inhibited by 20-50% in presence of 1 X 10(-3) M Asp, Met and Cys phosphoorganic derivatives. These amino acid derivatives may be used as potential antihypertensive drugs because of their metabolic stability and inhibitory action on the enzyme.", 
    "55": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor [3H]SQ29,852 identified a single high affinity recognition site (defined by 10.0 microM captopril) in the human temporal cortex (pKD 8.62 +/- 0.03; Bmax 248 +/- 24 fmol mg-1 protein, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 4). ACE inhibitors and thiorphan competed to a similar level for the [3H]SQ29,852 binding site in the human temporal cortex with a rank order of affinity (pKi values mean +/- S.E.M., n = 3), lisinopril (9.49 +/- 0.02), captopril (9.16 +/- 0.08), SQ29,852 (8.58 +/- 0.04), epicaptopril (7.09 +/- 0.08), fosinopril (7.08 +/- 0.05) and thiorphan (6.40 +/- 0.04). Since this rank order of affinity is similar to the affinity of these compounds to inhibit brain ACE activity it is concluded that [3H]SQ29,852 selectively labels the inhibitor recognition site of ACE in the human temporal cortex.", 
    "56": "Hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of intravenous captopril were studied in ten patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (NYHA Functional Class III and IV). Incremental bolus doses of captopril, titrated to a maximum cumulative dose of 15 mg, were given at 10-minute intervals. Systemic arterial pressure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and heart rate decreased (P less than .05). Cardiac index and stroke volume index increased (P less than .05). Maximum hemodynamic effects occurred after cumulative doses of 7 mg and were seen within 30 minutes after initiation of therapy; responses persisted for 30-90 minutes after the last dose. Plasma renin activity increased, and plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration decreased. No adverse effects were observed with the use of intravenous captopril. Thus, intravenous captopril produces rapid and favorable hemodynamic improvement in advanced heart failure patients.", 
    "57": "1. Zabicipril, S9650, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to salt-replete, normotensive males in single doses of up to 10 mg. 2. The safety, tolerance and dose-response relationship with regard to inhibition of plasma ACE activity were characterised initially in an open, pilot, dose-finding study in 12 subjects and further explored in a double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled study in another 30 subjects. 3. The drug was generally well tolerated and produced no change in routine haematology or serum biochemistry tests. 4. Dose related (0.03 to 10 mg) inhibition of plasma converting-enzyme was observed, with 2.5 mg of zabicipril producing over 90% inhibition at 4 h and 60% at 24 h. 5. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects over the dose range studied. 6. A dose related rise in plasma renin activity and angiotensin I was observed. No dose related reduction in plasma aldosterone was observed. 7. These initial studies suggest that zabicipril is a well tolerated inhibitor of converting enzyme with near maximal inhibitory effect occurring at a dose of 2.5 mg. Further exploration of the dose range after single and multiple doses is indicated.", 
    "58": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out to assess the effects of a three-month treatment with a new ACE inhibitor, Benazepril (BNZ), on systemic and renal hemodynamics, and urine protein excretion, in 20 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, normal blood pressure (130/83 +/- 16/10 mm Hg), and normal renal function (creatine clearance 106 +/- 25 ml/min). Treatments with placebo or BNZ were assigned randomly. A wide range of proteinuria lowering effect was observed in overall population (from 1 to 84%, average 34%). Following the arbitrary level of a 30% reduction, two well-matched subgroups (10 patients for each one) were obtained: \"good responders\" (average decrease 51%), and \"poor responders\" (average decrease 17%). The main distinctive feature between the two groups was a higher plasma renin activity level in good than in poor responders. A positive correlation between the fall in proteinuria and blood pressure was found. Although the decrease in blood pressure seems to represent the major factor in determining the reduction in proteinuria, a multiple correlation analysis showed that the most prominent role (71%) was attributable to the combined decrease in blood pressure and filtration fraction, and then also to the efferent arteriole dilatation. Our conclusion is that ACE inhibitors are capable of also reducing proteinuria in patients with renal disease with normal blood pressure, the effect being more pronounced in those exhibiting humoral, systemic and renal hemodynamic patterns, indicating a greater activity of circulating and renal renin angiotensin system.", 
    "59": "This study compared the results of renal scintigraphy with simultaneous administration of Tc-99m DTPA and I-131 Hippuran (before and after 25 mg of oral captopril) with the results of the renal arteriogram and renal vein renins (before and after the administration of 25 mg of oral captopril) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. The results of 21 consecutive patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension who underwent scintigraphy and renal arteriography were analyzed. Renal scintigraphy postcaptopril detected all the cases of renovascular hypertension (eight patients) plus two additional patients who had significant renovascular stenosis but no renin overproduction. The results indicate that the renal scintigram, before and after the administration of captopril, is an accurate and sensitive test for the detection of renovascular hypertension and should be used as a screening procedure before arteriography is considered.", 
    "60": "A rat model that provides a rapid method for the in vivo evaluation of potential inhibitors of human renin has been developed and validated. Recombinant human renin was infused intravenously into anesthetized, nephrectomized, ganglion-blocked rats. The resulting blood pressure had an approximate 60 mm Hg human renin-dependent component. The angiotensin I to angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, and the renin inhibitor, ditekiren (U-71038), were capable of abolishing this component after oral administration. Oral administration of ditekiren to rats receiving human renin infusions evoked dose-dependent hypotensive responses that were greater in magnitude and longer in duration than those elicited in rats receiving hog renin infusions. Observations made in the renin-infused rats reflected the results of in vitro kinetic studies that had indicated a greater binding affinity of ditekiren for human renin than for hog renin.", 
    "61": "It has been proposed that lowering glomerular pressure in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus will reduce microalbuminuria and that this reduction may preserve renal function. We therefore conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to compare 3 months of treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (0.9 mg/kg/day), and 3 months of placebo administration to 12 normotensive adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 11 with microalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate of 15 to 200 micrograms/min) and one with early overt nephropathy. Mean age (+/- SD) was 14.4 +/- 1.7 years, and disease duration was 5.1 +/- 2.5 years. Albumin excretion rate decreased significantly during captopril therapy (baseline 78 +/- 114 micrograms/min; mean of monthly measurements 38 +/- 55 micrograms/min vs placebo 78 +/- 140 micrograms/min; p less than 0.001). During captopril therapy, albumin excretion was reduced by 41 +/- 44% and decreased in 10 of 12 subjects, but was unchanged in two, one with a borderline albumin excretion rate (16.3 micrograms/min) and one with diabetes of short duration (2.9 years). Plasma renin activity rose significantly during captopril therapy, and mean arterial pressure decreased slightly (placebo 81 +/- 7 mm Hg; captopril 76 +/- 5 mm Hg; p = 0.004). After 3 months of captopril treatment, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow did not change significantly. Hemoglobin Alc values remained stable during the study. The only side effect of captopril was diarrhea in one patient. We conclude that, in the short term, captopril is effective in decreasing albumin excretion rate in normotensive children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria, without significant side effects. Longer trials are indicated in an attempt to delay or prevent overt nephropathy.", 
    "62": "We compared acute hemodynamic, hormonal, and natriuretic responses to a single oral dose of captopril (50 mg) versus enalapril maleate (10 mg) administered to eight patients with biopsy-proved liver cirrhosis. Although the two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lowered (p less than 0.05) blood pressure with no change in heart rate during the early postdose period, captopril produced a greater (p less than 0.05) hypotensive effect than did enalapril. Enalapril caused a greater (p less than 0.01 to 0.05) ACE inhibition than did captopril during the 2- to 48-hour postdose period. Plasma renin activity increased (p less than 0.05) with the two drugs and returned toward baseline by 12 hours after administration. Plasma aldosterone levels, elevated before drug administration, were decreased by the two drugs in a stepwise fashion, but the suppressive effect was greater (p less than 0.01 or p less than 0.05) after captopril than after enalapril. Natriuresis was greater (p less than 0.05) during the first 24-hour period after enalapril than after captopril. The findings indicate that the acute pharmacodynamic responses to the two ACE inhibitors differ in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, the mechanism(s) of the divergent effects of the two drugs and the clinical implications remain obscure from this single-dose study.", 
    "63": "The hemodynamic effects of quinapril, a novel nonsulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were assessed in 10 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Compared with placebo, quinapril (20 mg) administered twice daily for 4 weeks significantly lowered blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral resistance without producing tachycardia, an increase in cardiac output, or a rise in plasma catecholamines. Quinapril significantly reduced renal, but not forearm, vascular resistance. Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and filtration fraction remained unchanged. Left ventricular wall stress was markedly reduced by quinapril, but during the relatively short treatment period, only a nonsignificant trend toward reduction in left ventricular mass was observed. These findings suggest that quinapril is an effective antihypertensive agent that lowers peripheral resistance without increasing cardiac output or disturbing autoregulation of renal hemodynamics.", 
    "64": "Several zinc parameters were assessed in 13 patients with essential hypertension who were chronically taking only captopril (six subjects) or enalapril (seven subjects), as well as in six untreated hypertensives, and nine healthy controls. Serum zinc levels were comparable in all groups. Twenty-four-hour urinary zinc excretion was significantly increased in the captopril-treated patients compared with the other three groups. The zinc:creatinine ratio in 24-hour urine was significantly increased in both captopril and enalapril groups, but was significantly greater in the former. Although plasma zinc concentrations were comparable in all groups, red blood cell (RBC) zinc values were significantly decreased in the captopril group compared with the other three groups. We conclude that (1) although both captopril and enalapril produce renal zinc loss, this loss is far greater in patients receiving captopril; and (2) captopril administration over 3 months or more generates RBC zinc depletion.", 
    "65": "The effects of specific active immunization against renin were compared with those of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were immunized (SHR-I) (n = 10) against pure murine renin (four injections of 30 micrograms/kg s.c.) or received (SHR-P) (n = 11) a converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril, 2 mg/kg/day per os for 4 weeks). Sham-immunized SHR (SHR-S) (n = 12) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY-S) (n = 12) rats served as controls. At 15 weeks of age, 24-hour average blood pressure was obtained in freely moving rats using intra-aortic pressure recording with computer analysis. Antirenin immunization induced high circulating titers of antibodies, a fall in plasma renin activity (-95%), and urinary excretion of mineralocorticoids. Perindopril abolished the pressor response to angiotensin I, whereas plasma ACE was only partly (-56%) decreased. It also increased plasma renin activity and did not alter the urinary excretion of steroids. Both immunization and perindopril allowed the blood pressure of SHR to return to the level of WKY-S rats and reduced the left ventricular weight. These decreases were associated with an elevated sympathetic nervous system activity as indicated by increases in the urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. It is conclude that, apart from an unaltered steroid synthesis, most of the cardiovascular effects of chronic ACE inhibition are similar to those of antirenin immunization, thus indicating that blockade of the circulating and renal renin-angiotensin system accounts for most of the effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "66": "The amino acid sequence of angiotensin I (ANG I) from the Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, obtained from incubation of homologous plasma and kidney extract was determined as H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Val-His-Pro-Phe-Ser-Leu-OH. A bolus, intravenous injection of native ANG I or of ANG II induced an immediate vasodepressor response and a subsequent vasopressor response in quail which has been lightly anesthetized with urethane (0.75 g/kg). The values for ED50 for the vasopressor and depressor effects of ANG II were 85 and 113 pmol/100 g body weight, respectively. The extent of the hypotension was dependent on the arterial pressure prior to injection. The effects of ANG I and II on heart rate were variable. Human [Asp1, Ile5, His9] ANG I and II were almost as potent as their quail counterparts with respect to the cardiovascular effects, but eel [Asn1, Val5, Gly9]ANG I and II were less than half as potent. Human ANG III had little effect on arterial pressure in the quail. A bolus injection (100 micrograms/100 g) or infusion (1 micrograms/100 g/min) of [Sar1, Ile8] ANG II almost abolished the cardiovascular effects of ANG I and II, but [Sar1, Ala8] ANG II and [Sar1, Thr8] ANG II, which are effective inhibitors in mammals, had no inhibitory effects. The vasopressor and depressor effects of ANG I were abolished, while those of ANG II were slightly enhanced, after injection (100 micrograms/100 g) or infusion (1 micrograms/100 g/min) of SQ14225, whereas des-Pro2 bradykinin and bradykinin potentiator B, which are effective inhibitors of ANG I converting enzyme in mammals, failed to inhibit the effect of ANG I. These results indicate that vascular ANG II receptors and ANG I converting enzyme in the quail may be different from those in mammals.", 
    "67": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma concentration (Cp) of perindoprilat (P), the active metabolite of perindopril, and plasma converting enzyme activity (CEA) after a single oral administration of perindopril. CEA and Cp were investigated before, and, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 and 48 hours after a random administration of a placebo or 4, 8, 16 mg perindopril in a double-blind and crossover study performed in 6 healthy male volunteers. Effect on CEA was expressed as the percentage of inhibition of pretreatment value (CEA0): CEI = 100 (CEA0 = CEA)/CEA0. The CEI-Cp relationship was non linear and displayed an hysteresis loop. Following Sheiner et al. (Clin Pharmacol Ther, 1979; 25: 358-71), we used an effect compartment in which drug dissipation is governed by a first-order rate constant keo. Concentration of P in the effect compartment (Ce) was related to CEI by the Hill equation CEI = 100 Emax Cen/(EC50n + Cen), where Emax (expressed as a percentage) is the theoretical maximum effect, EC50 the Ce which produces 50 p. 100 of Emax, and n the Hill coefficient. Pharmacodynamic parameters were estimated by the non parametric approach proposed by Unadkat et al. (Clin Pharmacol Ther, 1986; 40: 86-93). The Hill equation was fitted to the data for 3 different values of n: 1, 2, and 3.",

    "69": "In previous studies, we established a strong concordance between nocturnal oscillations in plasma renin activity (PRA) and REM-NREM sleep cycles. To determine whether this relation persists in the case of moderate essential hypertension and if it is influenced by antihypertensive therapies affecting renin release, six normal subjects and six hypertensive patients were studied. The normal subjects underwent one control night. The hypertensive patients were studied during a first night when a placebo was given. Four of them underwent a second night following a single dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril; and a third night, 45 days later, with the antihypertensive treatment. In addition, two of the patients underwent two night-studies, after a single and repeated doses of a beta-blocker, atenolol, to see whether preventing renin release modified the sleep structure. The relationship between the nocturnal PRA oscillations and the sleep stage patterns persisted in hypertensive patients receiving placebo. In patients who had low PRA levels, the increases associated with NREM sleep were small. However, the mean relative amplitude of the oscillations, expressed as a percentage of the nocturnal mean, was about 60%, which was similar to that in normotensive subjects. Active renin and PRA oscillations were closely coupled. ACE activity profiles displayed damped fluctuations and no systematic relationship with sleep stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "Diabetes-associated hypertension is accompanied by high levels of body sodium and cardiovascular hyper-reactivity to noradrenaline. Captopril, a promising drug for the treatment of hypertension in diabetics, may influence sodium metabolism and adrenergic pathways. This possibility was investigated in 11 patients with non-azotaemic diabetes mellitus and hypertension, studied after a 3-week placebo phase and after an 8-week phase of captopril treatment (50-100 mg/day). Blood pressure, exchangeable body sodium, blood volume, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone, catecholamine levels and the pressor reactivity to infused Ang II or noradrenaline were measured. Compared with placebo, captopril caused a significant decrease in arterial pressure and stimulation of plasma renin activity. Exchangeable sodium, blood volume, plasma Ang II, aldosterone, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, the pressor and aldosterone responsiveness to infused Ang II and the pressor response to infused noradrenaline (alone or combined with atropine) were not modified. These findings suggest that in hypertensive diabetics angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition causes a marked decrease in blood pressure. The mechanism of action is unrelated to changes in body sodium or noradrenergic-dependent pressor reactivity. In the stable phase of therapy, Ang II-dependent pathways are left unaltered when captopril is administered twice a day.", 
    "71": "Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of Hoe 498, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, at the doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 4.0 mg/kg produced a dose-related inhibition of compound 48/80-induced hypovolemic thirst in rats. A significant time-response relationship was observed between the pretreatment time of Hoe 498 at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg and the inhibition of compound 48/80-induced water intake. Nearly 90% of plasma ACE activity was inhibited by Hoe 498 at all doses used, and this inhibition at the dose of 4.0 mg/kg of Hoe 498 continued for more than 4 hr. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or s.c. injection of Hoe 498 in doses ranging from 0.5 to 20 micrograms comparably inhibited plasma ACE activity in a dose-dependent manner. The compound 48/80-induced water intake was significantly reduced by i.c.v. injection of Hoe 498 (20 micrograms) 30 min after compound 48/80 administration, but not reduced when the drug was given 15 min prior to injection of dipsogen. The inhibition of water intake by Hoe 498 seems to be dependent on the dose and time between administration of Hoe 498 and compound 48/80. The present data suggest that brain ACE is more involved in compound 48/80-induced water intake than peripheral systemic ACE.", 
    "72": "1. To determine whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induces a decrease in proximal tubular angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, urine and blood samples were collected in conscious New Zealand rabbits before and after 16 days administration in drinking water of low doses of captopril (2.6 +/- 0.6 mg 24 h-1 kg-1), high doses of captopril (7.6 +/- 0.9 mg 24 h-1 kg-1) or no captopril (controls). The kidneys were then removed and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was determined in isolated pars recta of microdissected nephrons as pmol of tritiated hippurylglycylglycine substrate hydrolysed min-1 of incubation and mm-1 of tubule. 2. Both low and high doses of captopril significantly decreased plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and increased plasma renin activity, thus indicating an effective inhibition of circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme. Both low and high doses of captopril also significantly decreased mean arterial pressure and increased water intake and urine flow rate. Neither dose modified creatinine clearance and absolute and fractional sodium excretion. 3. None of the doses altered urinary kallikrein excretion. Urinary excretion of kinins was increased by 98.7% compared with control rabbits by the high dose of captopril (402 +/- 152 vs 251 +/- 104 ng/24 h, P less than 0.01) but was unchanged by the low dose of captopril. 4. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in the pars recta was lower in rabbits given the high dose of captopril than in control rabbits (17.6 +/- 7.2 vs 37.3 +/- 9.0 pmol min-1 mm-1, P less than 0.01) but was not decreased in rabbits given the low dose of captopril (40.4 +/- 5.0 pmol min-1 mm-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) from the rat heart and lung was studied by use of the radioligand [125I]-351A. 2. Displacement of the bound radioinhibitor [125I]-351A was used to assess the relative potency of six ACE inhibitors in rat heart and lung homogenates and estimate the binding association constant (KA). 3. The KA for atrial preparations was significantly higher than that of the lung (P less than 0.025) and also the ventricles (P less than 0.005). Ventricular preparations and preparations from the lung also differed significantly (P less than 0.05). These differences in KA were noted for all six ACE inhibitors used to displace the radioligand. 4. The rank order of potency of the ACE inhibitors was quinaprilat = benazeprilat greater than perindoprilat greater than 351A greater than lisinopril greater than fosinoprilat. 5. Cardiac ACE inhibition was studied ex vivo following oral administration of quinapril to rats. Following 0.3 mg kg-1 quinapril, the time course and degree of inhibition of ventricular and atrial ACE were similar. 6. These results suggest that the detected differences in KA noted have only a limited potential biological significance. The difference in KA may reflect variations in the structure or conformation of ACE in different tissues.", 
    "74": "The aim of the study was to compare efficacy and safety of quinapril and lisinopril once-daily administered in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a two-week placebo period, 23 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mmHg were randomly assigned to the therapy with quinapril 20 mg/die or lisinopril 10 mg/die for 4 weeks in a single-blind design. After 4 weeks patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg were treated with a higher dose (lisinopril 20 mg/die; quinapril 40 mg/die). Therapy with lisinopril normalized 83% of patients, and quinapril 45% of patients. Lisinopril was significantly better than quinapril in reducing blood pressure after 4 and 8 weeks of active treatment. The 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that quinapril failed to control blood pressure after 12 hours from the administration of the drug.", 
    "75": "The blood vessel wall's response to injury is an important determinant of luminal size and vessel function. The physiologic migration of endothelial cells from the edges of a wound and the pathophysiologic migration of medial smooth muscle cells into the intima are two important components of the vessel wall's response to injury. The influence of the angiotensin system on endothelial and smooth muscle cell migration have not been examined. In the present study, the influence of angiotensin system components on bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) and bovine aortic smooth muscle cell (BASMC) migration after release of cultured cell monolayers from contact inhibition was determined. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril increased BAEC migration 41% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001), as did the specific angiotensin II antagonist sar1, ile8-angiotensin II (SAR) (41% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001). Exogenous angiotensin I and angiotensin II did not affect BAEC migration. Exogenous angiotensin II abolished the effect of lisinopril on BAEC migration. Lisinopril increased cell-associated u-plasminogen activator (u-PA) 23% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001) in migrating BAEC and angiotensin II abolished this increase. SAR increased u-PA 33% +/- 0% (P less than 0.001). In contrast, these agents had the opposite effect on smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II increased smooth muscle cell migration 40% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001), and this effect was abolished by SAR. Angiotensin II also increased cell-associated u-PA 83% +/- 7% (P less than 0.001) in migrating BASMC. The increase in BAEC migration with inhibition of endothelial cell angiotensin II stimulation, either with lisinopril or SAR, also was associated with an increase in cell-associated u-PA. These results indicate that lisinopril interrupts an autocrine pathway in endothelial cells, in which endothelial cell-derived angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by ACE, and imply that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in vivo would act to reduce vessel wall injury by directly increasing the rate of endothelial cell wound closure; by increasing the antithrombotic tendency of the endothelium via enhanced u-PA; and indirectly, by decreasing production of angiotensin II and thereby the rate of smooth muscle cell migration into the intima.", 
    "76": "Renin, angiotensin-II, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) have been found in the hypothalamus and pituitary in rats, and renin, angiotensinogen, and ACE have been found in human pituitary lactotrophs. To determine the physiological relevance of the renin-angiotensin system in the pituitary hormone response to stress in humans, we created significant inhibition of ACE by administering a clinically used dose (10 mg) of enalapril (E) 4 h before measuring the stress hormone responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Eight fasting lean healthy males (aged 20-35 yr) were given either placebo (P) or E (10 mg, orally) in two studies separated by at least 5 days in a blinded study design. Glucose, ACTH, cortisol, PRL, and GH levels were measured before E or P and at 20-min intervals beginning 20 min before insulin administration. ACE levels were similar at baseline (E, 21.6 +/- 2.7; P, 22.4 +/- 2.4 mU/mL/min), but were significantly lower at the time of insulin injection with E treatment (E, 2.9 +/- 0.5; P, 20.9 +/- 2.5 mU/mL/min; P less than 0.001). The mean of the total area under the curve of PRL secretion was significantly lower for the E group (E, 3767.2 +/- 710.7; P, 4554.9 +/- 650.1 micrograms/L.min; P less than 0.05). Although the mean peak PRL levels were lower for the E group, this did not reach statistical significance (E, 53.0 +/- 9.7; P, 64.4 +/- 9.4 micrograms/L; 0.05 less than P less than 0.10). These differences in PRL responses appeared to be due primarily to substantial decreases in PRL responses with E in three of the eight subjects. No significant differences were found with ACTH, cortisol, or GH for basal levels, peak levels, or areas under the curve.", 
    "77": "Ten patients with severe heart failure, symptomatic despite treatment with diuretics and captopril, completed a study of the effect of adding enoximone to their normal treatment. Enoximone or matching placebo was given for 4 weeks in randomized double-blind order following a single-blind placebo run-in period. Exercise capability was measured with two different treadmill protocols, a corridor walk test and by step-counting with body-worn pedometers. Cardiac output and limb blood flow were assessed non-invasively by measuring respiratory gases and by venous occlusion plethysmography. Measurements were made at rest and in response to treadmill exercise. The mean exercise tolerance measured using the modified Bruce treadmill protocol was increased from the placebo value (498 +/- 91 seconds) after both 2 weeks (573 +/- 94 seconds, P = 0.051) and 4 weeks of enoximone (572 +/- 100 seconds, P = 0.057). Enoximone increased exercise duration in fixed workload tests from the placebo value (252 +/- 75 seconds) after 2 weeks' treatment (431 +/- 98 seconds, P = 0.011) and after 4 weeks (381 +/- 85 seconds, (P = 0.01). The percentage improvement with the fixed workload test was greater than with the modified Bruce protocol at week 2 (P = 0.03) and at week 4 (P = 0.051). Enoximone increased the speed of walking 100 m at self-selected slow, normal and fast paces. It had little effect on customary activity of the patients. Enoximone increased cardiac output measured at rest and during submaximal exercise (P = 0.001). It also improved blood flow to the calf muscle at rest and after exercise (P = 0.01). Enoximone has a beneficial effect in chronic heart failure symptomatic despite treatment with diuretics and captopril. The magnitude of its effect, however, depends upon the technique used to assess it.",

Before inclusion, all patients remained markedly symptomatic despite treatment with diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Symptoms and quality of life were evaluated at inclusion, and at days 4 and 31; 24-hour electrocardiography and Doppler echocardiography were performed at inclusion and at day 31. Clinical and echocardiographic baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. During the study, 10 patients dropped out: 3 in the enoximone group (1 death) and 7 in the placebo group (3 deaths). At day 4, symptoms were improved in 13 enoximone-treated patients and in 8 patients on placebo (P less than 0.05). At day 31, symptoms were still improving in 10 of 12 patients on enoximone and in 6 of 8 patients on placebo (NS). No serious clinical side-effects were reported, and no statistically significant difference in the frequency of premature ventricular contractions between the two groups was apparent on Holter monitoring. Peak acceleration of ascending aortic blood flow at entry was 17 +/- 6 m/second2 in the enoximone group and 18 +/- 5 m/second2 in the placebo group (NS). At day 31, the change in peak acceleration was +20% in the enoximone group vs -6% in the placebo group (P less than 0.05).

    "79": "Fosinopril (SQ 28,555) is a member of a new chemical class of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors being developed by The Squibb Institute for Medical Research. During or following absorption, fosinopril, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed pharmacologically to the active diacid, SQ 27,519. A specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of SQ 27,519 in human serum has been developed. The assay utilizes a specific SQ 27,519 antibody, 125I-iodohistamine-SQ 27,519 radiolabel, and human serum standards. Satisfactory zero binding and assay sensitivity are achieved after a 2-h incubation at room temperature. Separation of the antibody-bound and free radiolabeled antigens is achieved by using polyethylene glycol-goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin separant. Recovery efficiencies ranged from 97.2 to 109.4%. The assay exhibited little or no cross-reactivity with captopril. Cross-reactivities for prodrug (SQ 28,555) and phenolic SQ 27,519 were 5 and 9%, respectively. Intra-assay variability (3.3-5.6%) and interassay variability (7.1-6.6%) were observed. Linear regression analysis indicates that RIA and [14C] thin-layer radiochromatography (TLRC) methods gave a highly significant correlation (RIA = 1.0 [14C]TLRC + 0.17, r = 0.991). Pharmacokinetic profiles of patient sera containing SQ 27,519 obtained by RIA and [14C]TLRC are identical. The RIA has been used routinely in support of the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies of fosinopril in humans.", 
    "80": "In a double-blind 6 month trial, the cardiac effects of captopril and minoxidil, administered as third step treatments, were compared in 34 men with essential hypertension and diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg who were taking 200 mg/day of metoprolol and 80 mg/day of furosemide. Average daily doses of captopril and minoxidil were 269 mg (range 150 to 300) and 20 mg (range 7.5 to 30), respectively. At the end of the 6 months' treatment, blood pressure had dropped significantly in both groups, but echocardiographic criteria of hypertrophy improved only in the captopril group (intragroup comparison): blood pressure, thickness of the intraventricular septum and posterior wall, and the left ventricular mass index, respectively, decreased from 163/102 to 135/89 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), 17.4 to 15.9 mm (p less than 0.05), 14.5 to 13.4 mm (p less than 0.05) and 236 to 198 g/m2 (p less than 0.001). In the minoxidil group, blood pressure dropped from 160/99 to 137/87 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), but echocardiographic criteria were not significantly modified. Fractional shortening remained normal in both groups. These results show that in patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy, captopril-based triple therapy reduces left ventricular mass without altering systolic performance, whereas minoxidil-based therapy does not.", 
    "81": "Early chronic sympathectomy does not normalize blood pressure (BP) in genetically hypertensive rats of the Lyon strain (LH). The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and vasopressin in the residual hypertension exhibited by LH sympathectomized rats. Chronic sympathectomy was achieved by treating male LH and control normotensive LN rats with guanethidine sulfate between 1 and 13 weeks of age (60 mg/kg daily from day 7 after birth to day 25, 30 mg/kg daily from day 26 to day 70 and 30 mg/kg every other day from day 71 to day 90). At 14 weeks of age, catheters were inserted into the lower abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava via the left femoral artery and vein. After 2 days of recovery, BP was continuously recorded in the conscious freely moving animals during 3 consecutive 1-hour periods: before and after administration of either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril 2 mg/kg i.v.) or a selective vascular vasopressin antagonist [beta-mercapto- beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionyl1, O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8-vasopressin, AVPX 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) and finally after conjoint administration of both drugs. At the end of each period, the efficacy of blockade was verified by the disappearance of pressor responses to respective agonists (angiotensin I 150 ng/kg i.v., Arg8-vasopressin 10 ng/kg i.v.). Chronic treatment with guanethidine resulted in the disappearance of pressor responses to tyramine (250 micrograms/kg i.v.) indicating complete functional denervation of the vessels. Under basal conditions, the 1-hour average value of mean BP (MBP) was higher in LH than in LN sympathectomized rats (134 +/- 3 vs 104 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "Captopril and Enalapril, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, were used in the treatment of grave renal hypertension. The treatment concerned 40 randomly selected patients with the average creatinine clearance of 55.7 ml/min. The patients were divided in two groups: the first groups was ril. The good regulation of blood pressure was achieved only in combination with furosemide and protreated with captopril and the second with enalappranolol. Furosemide was given to all patients, and propranolol to all treated with captopril and to 12 subjects treated with enalapril. The angiotensin converting enzyme increased plasma renine activity and decreased aldosterone concentration in the serum. No change in renal function was noted. Proteinuria was decreased. Side-effects were manifest in two patients only treated with captopril. In conclusion it can be said that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are efficient in the treatment of renal hypertension.", 
    "83": "This study has been performed in order to evaluate whether furosemide can induce changes in blood pressure independently of its diuretic effects,and whether its pressor effects are connected with the ability to synthetize renal prostaglandins. The experiments were performed in four groups of volume-expanded rats: the first (n.5) had bilateral ligation of the renal vessels; the second (n.8) had bilateral ligation of the ureters; the third group (n.6) had ureters ligation after pre-treatment with indomethacin; the fourth group (n.2) received a pre-treatment with captopril. After blood pressure stabilization, furosemide was administered i.v. (0.125 mg/100 g. of body weight). Indirect readings of the blood pressure were obtained at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 min. After furosemide administration, blood pressure fell down quickly in the rats with ureteral ligation and in those with captopril pretreatment, while the tensive response to furosemide was blunted by the indomethacin treatment. In conclusion, furosemide can reduce blood pressure by a mechanism non related with its diuretic properties, which, however, requires the integrity of the renal connections with the circulatory system.", 
    "84": "Since angiotensin II seems to be involved in the process of ovulation we studied the effect of chronic enalapril on plasma prorenin, renin, estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH during the menstrual cycle in ten essential hypertensive women. Our data show that peripheral blockade of A I conversion does not affect the pituitary guidance and the ovarian hormonal response of the menstrual cycle and, we can speculate, that it does not interfere with the process of ovulation.", 
    "85": "The occurrence of a dry, nonproductive cough during ACE inhibitors therapy has been described in several reports. However, the mechanism of this effect is still unknown. In order to clarify whether ACE inhibitor-induced cough is a symptom of an asthmatic disturbance, six patients (age 54-68) with cough related to captopril or enalapril were rechallenged with ACE inhibitors after an adequate washout period. Baseline airway function and bronchial reactivity to metacholine were measured at the end of the washout period and on the fourth day of rechallenge which was accompanied by the reappearance of cough without wheezing. Rechallenge did not cause changes in dynamic lung function; a low and not significant (p less than 0.1) increase in metacholine dose causing a 15% and a 20% reduction in baseline FEV 1 was observed. It is concluded that cough and bronchoconstriction are likely to be mediated through different nervous pathways and that ACE inhibitor-induced cough is not a variant of asthmatic cough.", 
    "86": "Nephrotoxicity and arterial hypertension are the most common side effects of treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA). Its effects on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the renal cortex, lung and serum of nephrotoxic rats have been investigated. Wistar rats were treated with CSA (20 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p.) or vehicle (olive oil containing 10% ethanol) for 14 days. On day 15, the rats were killed and ACE activity determined by radiometric assay using [3H]hippuryl-glycyl-glycine as substrate. CSA treatment resulted in a decrease in creatinine clearance, urine flow and body weight and a significant increase in serum and lung ACE activities (436 +/- 9 vs 391 +/- 7 nmol mL-1 min-1, P less than 0.001; 184 +/- 8 vs 142 +/- 10 nmol mg-1 min-1 P less than 0.01, respectively). In contrast, renal cortex ACE activity was reduced in the CSA-treated rats (0.35 +/- 0.02 vs 0.51 +/- 0.02 nmol mg-1 min-1, P less than 0.01). ACE activities in the renal cortex and serum were not affected by treatment with gentamicin (80 mg kg-1 day-1) for 11 days. In rats treated simultaneously with CSA and captopril (50 mg kg-1 day-1) ACE activity in the serum, lung and renal cortex was inhibited by 95, 93 and 92%, respectively. These changes in ACE activity were associated with a decreased systolic blood pressure in the rats receiving CSA and captopril. Therefore, ACE activity in the serum and lung of CSA-treated rats was increased, while its activity in the renal cortex was reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "The effect of chronic captopril administration on indocyanine green (ICG) clearance and hepatic extraction has been studied in the rat using the intact liver for ICG clearance and the isolated perfused liver for ICG extraction. The captopril was added to the drinking water to give a calculated daily intake from 0-45 mg kg-1. Hepatic clearance of ICG was dose related from 16.5 +/- 2.4 (control) to 7.2 +/- 1.6 mL min-1 kg-1, respectively. The hepatic extraction of ICG was not significantly different (37 +/- 6%) from the control value in groups on 4 and 45 mg kg-1 daily. Since ICG clearance and extraction are dependent on hepatic blood, a change in ICG clearance without a change in the extraction reflects a similar change in the hepatic blood flow. This remained unchanged at daily captopril intakes of 1 and 4 mg kg-1 and decreased when the daily intake was 10 mg kg-1 or higher. If these results in the rat are applicable to man, the chronic administration of therapeutic doses of captopril (0.5-2 mg kg-1) will not affect the hepatic blood flow.", 
    "88": "We utilized multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-flow (P/Q) plots to investigate the effects of halothane anesthesia on the pulmonary circulation. Our first objective was to assess the extent to which the P/Q relationship measured in conscious dogs is altered during halothane anesthesia. P/Q plots were constructed by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to decrease venous return and Q. Compared with conscious dogs, halothane (approximately 1.2% end-tidal) resulted in active, flow-independent pulmonary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.01) at all levels of Q. Halothane also decreased (P less than 0.01) systemic arterial pressure and Q. Thus our second objective was to determine whether the halothane-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction was mediated by reflex neurohumoral activation or by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway. However, the magnitude of halothane-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction was not significantly reduced by sympathetic alpha-adrenoreceptor block, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition, combined arginine vasopressin V1 + V2 receptor block, or by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Finally, halothane-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.01) was also observed when compared with pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs during controlled ventilation. Thus, compared with the conscious state, halothane anesthesia causes active flow-independent pulmonary vasoconstriction that is not mediated by reflex neurohumoral activation, by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway, nor is it due to the effects of general anesthesia and controlled ventilation.", 
    "89": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibits increased cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to environmental stress and behavioral hyperactivity relative to the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). This study sought to determine whether enhanced CVR to stress in the SHR is related to hypertension or to behavioral hyperactivity. By breeding SHR with WKY, followed by inbreeding, E. D. Hendley has developed two strains in which the hypertensive trait seems to be separated from the hyperactivity trait: the Wistar-Kyoto hypertensive (WK-HT) and the Wistar-Kyoto hyperactive (WK-HA) strains. Male SHR, WKY, WK-HT, and WK-HA rats were implanted with intravascular catheters and Doppler flow-velocity probes to record arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), and changes in regional vascular resistances. Five days after surgery, the rats were subjected to air-jet stress and pharmacological interventions. The hyperactive strains (SHR and WK-HA) exhibited enhanced pressor, renal, and mesenteric responses to stress, and higher HRs under all conditions, even after autonomic blockade. Both hypertension and hyperactivity were associated with reduced baroreceptor sensitivity. These data indicate that CVR to stress is related to behavioral traits.", 
    "90": "Intrathecal injection of mice with substance P (SP) or its C-terminal fragments results in a behavioral syndrome characterized by reciprocal caudally directed biting and scratching. Repeated injection of SP, but not SP C-terminal fragments, results in a decrease in the intensity of, or desensitization to, these SP-induced behaviors. Peptidase inhibitors, phosphoramidon (PH), bacitracin (BAC), diprotin A (DPA) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI OR SQ20881), together with [3H]SP, were used to investigate the possible accumulation of tritiated N-terminal metabolites in the mouse spinal cord in vivo during the development of desensitization to SP. SP N-terminal metabolites in the spinal cord were quantified by reverse-phase HPLC. The magnitude of SP-induced desensitization correlated well (r = .95) with total SP N-terminal metabolites recovered from the spinal cords of the same mice studied in vivo. The magnitude of SP-induced desensitization was also found to be negatively correlated (r = .95) with total recovered intact [3H]SP. The rank order of potency of the peptidase inhibitors in decreasing the magnitude of SP-induced desensitization was BAC = PH much greater than ACEI greater than DPA. The order of potency for in vitro inhibition of SP metabolism using synaptic membrane-derived peptidases was BAC greater than PH much greater than ACEI. These results support the hypothesis that desensitization to SP-induced behaviors depends, at least in part, on the concentration of SP N-terminal metabolites in the spinal cord.", 
    "91": "The subjects, six asthmatic patients with mild essential hypertension, were aged 48 to 63 years and each was being treated with theophylline. Five patients received 10 mg of enalapril daily for two weeks and one received 5 mg for four weeks. Their bronchial responses to inhaled methacholine were measured with a modification of the 3-Hz oscillation method before and after the enalapril treatment. The patients' mean blood pressures decreased significantly from 180.7/100.3 to 152.0/93.3 mmHg after treatment. No treatment-associated changes in the frequency of coughing, the number of asthmatic attacks, or use of antiasthmatic drugs were noted. The results of the bronchial provocation tests revealed no changes in bronchial sensitivity or reactivity during treatment. Serum substance P levels were 61.3 pg/ml before treatment and 60.2 pg/ml after treatment. It is concluded that therapeutic doses of enalapril did not exacerbate asthmatic attacks or increase bronchial hypersensitivity in these asthmatic, hypertensive patients.", 
    "92": "1. The effects of intravenous captopril and enalaprilic acid on the increase in pulmonary inflation pressure induced by different bronchoconstrictor agents were evaluated in the anaesthetized guinea-pig. 2. Captopril and enalaprilic acid (1.6-200 micrograms kg-1) enhanced dose-dependently the bronchoconstriction (BC) induced by substance P. The threshold effective dose was 1.6 micrograms kg-1 and maximal potentiation over the control response was more than 400% for both agents. Enalaprilic acid was also assayed for serum and lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. This drug produced a dose-dependent inhibition of ACE in both tissues, with ED50 s of 7.6 and 9.4 micrograms kg-1, respectively: this inhibitory activity was positively correlated to substance P potentiation. 3. Captopril (8-1000 micrograms kg-1) enhanced dose-dependently the BC induced by capsaicin. The threshold effective dose was 40 micrograms kg-1 and maximal potentiation about 90%. 4. Captopril (200-1000 micrograms kg-1) did not affect BC induced by bradykinin. However, this response was markedly enhanced (about 200%) by captopril 200 micrograms kg-1 in propranolol-pretreated animals. 5. Captopril and enalaprilic acid (200-1000 micrograms kg-1) slightly (20-40%) but significantly enhanced the BC induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine. However, this response was potentiated to the same extent by a dose of prazosin, which produced a degree of hypotension similar to that observed after administration of the ACE inhibitors. 6. In conclusion, ACE inhibitors potentiate the BC induced by substance P and, to a minor extent, that induced by capsaicin in the anaesthetized guinea-pig. Potentiation of substance P is well correlated with ACE inhibition in guinea-pig serum and lungs. These experimental results may offer a mechanistic interpretation of cough and bronchial hyperreactivity observed in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "93": "In a randomized single-blind cross-over trial, the efficacy of digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by quinapril, and their combination on exercise tolerance, heart size (echocardiography), and neurohumoral systems was investigated in 19 outpatients with congestive heart failure (CHF) New York Heart Association functional class II and sinus rhythm. Baseline therapy consisted of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and remained unchanged. After treatment with quinapril, exercise tolerance significantly increased (606 vs. 644 s, 2 p less than 0.03) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (63 vs. 58 mm, 2 p less than 0.03), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP, 100 vs. 92 mm Hg, 2 p less than 0.03) and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels (378 vs. 323 pg/ml, 2 p less than 0.03) were significantly reduced. Digoxin increased resting systolic blood pressure (SBP 133 vs. 142 mm Hg, 2 p less than 0.03). Combined administration of both drugs significantly increased fractional shortening (24 vs. 28%, 2 p less than 0.03), reflecting the positive inotropic action of digoxin in combination with afterload reduction. However, there was no further increase in exercise tolerance. Our data suggest that early administration of ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in patients with mild CHF and sinus rhythm, although the magnitude of improvement was less substantial than that reported for patients with more severe CHF.", 
    "94": "The effects of enalaprilat on the renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system during sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension and halothane anesthesia were studied in three groups of New Zealand white rabbits. Two groups of rabbits (E and EH) were treated with an infusion of enalaprilat at 3.5 micrograms/kg/min i.v. One enalaprilat-treated group (EH) and the third, untreated group (H) received SNP to induce hypotension. In these two groups, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was reduced by 40% for 150 min. Group E did not undergo SNP-induced hypotension and served to document the effects of enalaprilat alone during the 150-min study period. Arterial blood samples for norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were drawn prior to and during hypotension, and during the recovery period. The SNP dose required to maintain the hypotension was continuously recorded. NE, EPI, and PRA all increased in group H, indicating activation of both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic system during hypotension. The amount of SNP required by group H to maintain a 40% reduction in MAP correlated with circulating NE levels (p less than 0.001) and not PRA. In group EH, PRA levels rose sharply and remained elevated. Plasma NE and EPI levels increased slightly with a decline in the SNP dose requirement. Group E demonstrated a rise in PRA levels, accompanied by unchanged NE and EPI levels and MAP during the study period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In conscious dogs, intravenous infusion of SQ 27,519 [0.5 mg/kg (1.1 mumol/kg) bolus plus 0.1 mg/kg/min (0.22 mumol/kg/min)], the active moiety of the prodrug fosinopril, increased PAH clearance and GFR by 25 and 16%, respectively (p less than 0.05, each) without changing arterial pressure (AP). Urine volume, sodium excretion, and potassium excretion were elevated, although not significantly increased. In sodium-depleted cynomolgus monkeys, 1.5 and 5.0 mumol/kg (0.88 and 2.9 mg/kg) p.o. of fosinopril lowered arterial pressure from 115 +/- 5 to 99 +/- 5 mm Hg and from 116 +/- 3 to 87 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively (p less than 0.05, each).

The purpose of the present report is to present the in vivo pharmacology of ceranapril in conscious animal models. In conscious, normotensive rats, ceranapril administered i.v. (ED50 = 63 nmol/kg) or p.o. (ED50 = 530 nmol/kg) inhibited an AI pressor response with potency equal to that of captopril. However, in conscious dogs, ceranapril was a relatively poor inhibitor of the AI pressor response after both i.v. (ED50 = 300 nmol/kg) and p.o. (ED50 = 18 mumol/kg) administration; in monkeys ceranapril was a good inhibitor of the AI pressor response after i.v. (ED50 = 60 nmol/kg) but not p.o. (ED50 = 18 mumol/kg) administration. In rats, the duration of ceranapril's inhibition of an AI pressor response was longer than an equimolar dose of captopril. Similarly, in SHR, ceranapril's blood pressure lowering effect had a longer duration than that of captopril. Ceranapril's ACE inhibitory effects were longer lasting in anephric rats than in sham rats, suggesting a renal route of excretion for ceranapril. Ceranapril administration to conscious female dogs resulted in significant increases in renal plasma flow and GFR. In SHR, doses of 23 and 68 mumol/kg resulted in significant blood pressure lowering that lasted 24 h. Oral doses of 2.3, 6.8, 23, and 68 mumol/kg in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats resulted in significant and dose-related falls in arterial pressure, which again persisted for 24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "97": "We examined the effects of the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 in the isolated heart and defined interactions of endothelin-1 with other hormone systems. Isolated isovolumic rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at constant pressure. First, the effect of a single bolus of endothelin-1 (4-400 pmol) was followed for 90 min. The effect of high dosages (40 and 400 pmol) of endothelin-1 on coronary flow was biphasic, with an early vasodilator and a late vasoconstrictor component that was irreversible. Second, cumulative dose-response curves were obtained for endothelin-1 boluses of 0.04-400 pmol. Coronary flow declined with increasing dosages and was almost abolished at 400 pmol. Neither alpha- nor beta-blocking agents (phentolamine and propranolol) nor the Ca2(+)-channel blocker nifedipine altered the effects of endothelin-1, but prostaglandin synthesis inhibition by indomethacin significantly augmented vasoconstriction by endothelin-1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril antagonized endothelin-1-dependent vasoconstriction to a small extent at 400 pmol. Coronary constriction due to endothelin-1 could not be reversed by nitroglycerin. We conclude that in isolated rat heart endothelin-1 causes marked and long-lasting coronary constriction. The effect is not influenced by sympathetic and Ca2(+)-channel blockade, is enhanced by prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, and is reduced by ACE inhibition.", 
    "98": "In private practice mild or moderate arterial hypertension is controlled primarily to prevent the development of a severe, organ-damaging hypertensive disease. The general practitioner's approach to management proceeds in 3 steps. 1) He must decide to initiate a treatment after obtaining sufficient evidence that the hypertension is permanent and after starting to correct the associated risk factors. 2) He must select a single-drug initial treatment among the four families of antihypertensive medications, viz.: diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists. The selection is based on the information available concerning the benefit/risk ratio of the preferred drug, its interactions with the pathologies that are often associated with hypertension, and its acceptability. Finding for each patient the optimal dosage with maximum effectiveness and minimum undesirable side-effects is of prime importance. 3) If this initial treatment fails, the practitioner must first make sure that his prescription was optimal in dosage and compliance. If this was the case, he must make a choice between another single-drug therapy and a combination therapy, using by preference two synergistic drugs in low doses.",

Diuretics and beta-blockers prescribed as first-line treatment of moderate arterial hypertension have only partly fulfilled these requirements: they have significantly reduced the incidence of cerebral vascular accidents but have been unable to lower the incidence of coronary disease which is the main cause of death in hypertensive subjects. Because of this failure, the objectives of antihypertensive treatments had to be revised as follows. The first objective is to ensure a satisfactory control of blood pressure with good compliance, which means that the drugs must be well tolerated and easy to take regularly. The second objective os to reduce the rhythmic and metabolic factors of coronary disease. The third objective is to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy and vascular wall hypertrophy. CEI are as effective as diuretics or beta-blockers in controlling blood pressure, but they are better tolerated from the clinical, metabolic and rhythmic points of view and they act effectively on ventricular and vascular hypertrophy. Following this assessment, although CEI have not proved efficient as regards cardiovascular prevention, in 1988 the WHO authorities have decided that they should be used as first-line treatment in moderate arterial hypertension.", 
    "100": "The multicentre ramipril trial was original in that the CEI was tested at its lowest effective dosage level. More than 80 p. 100 of the patients responded to a single-drug treatment with ramipril 5 mg per day or less. At that dosage level the drug was well tolerated and no severe or serious side-effect was noted. A relation could be demonstrated between the prevalence of cough and the dose of ramipril. The trial was carried out in a population of ambulatory patients with moderate, uncomplicated arterial hypertension (DAP between 95 and 115 mmHg and SAP less than or equal to 200 mmHg). It was conducted according to the \"Good Clinical Practice\" rules by 102 general practitioners, under their usual conditions of work, and this provided them with experience for further clinical studies of hypertension and with education for the managements of that disease in private practice.", 
    "101": "In a multicenter study in general practice, the tolerability and safety of ramipril alone and in combination with a low dose of furosemide were assessed in moderate hypertension. After a placebo run-in period involving 770 patients, 661 were included in the active treatment period and received ramipril alone (2.5-5 mg/day). After 6 weeks, the nonresponders entered in a double-blind period and they received daily ramipril 10 mg or ramipril 5 mg in combination with furosemide 20 mg. In this hypertensive population, the adverse events more commonly reported were headache, cough, dizziness, asthenia, cramps diarrhea and nausea, but not all these events were related to ramipril. There was seemingly a relation between cough prevalence and rampiril dosage; an increased incidence was also observed during the outbreaks of flu-syndrome in our country. 38 patients discontinued the active treatment due to non-serious adverse events, mainly cough, dizziness or diarrhea. No serious adverse drug reaction was observed. Laboratory data (blood cells count, electrolytes, serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose, apolipoproteins AI and B) remained most commonly unaffected. In moderate hypertension in general practice, this study confirms that ramipril is well tolerated, especially with regard to the class effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "102": "The 770 subjects enrolled into the French multicenter trial of Triatec (ramipril) presented the usual characteristics of moderate hypertension. After a low rate of response to placebo (9.1 p. 100), over half the active treatment patients responded to Triatec 2.5 mg (57 p. 100). Later on, Triatec 5 mg achieved control of half the remaining patients (55.6 p. 100); lastly, among non-responders to that posology, no difference was noted between monotherapy with 10 mg of Triatec, and the combination of 20 mg of Lasilix (furosemide) and Triatec 5 mg (respectively 44.7 p. 100 and 47.4 p. 10 responders). As a whole, more than 90 p. 100 of the patients responded to the proposed treatment plan.", 
    "103": "Triatec is a new ACE inhibitor. The initial recommended dose is a single daily intake of 2.5 to 10 mg. In order to validate a dose escalation schedule allowing each patient to be treated with the minimal effective dose, a multicenter clinical trial has been conducted by 102 general practitioners, under conditions close to their habits, on 770 mild hypertension patients with a 16 weeks follow-up. The trial consisted in 4 periods: after a placebo run-in period, the patients whose hypertension remained (supine diastolic blood pressure -DBP-between 95 and 115 mmHg) would receive 2.5 mg of Triatec a day, for 3 weeks. After completion of this first treatment period, non-responders (DBP greater than 90 mmHg) to Triatec 2.5 mg would receive 5 mg of Triatec a day, during 3 weeks. Non responders to Triatec 5 mg a day would then be randomized into a 6 weeks double-blind parallel group trial comparing monotherapy by 10 mg of Triatec to the association of Triatec 5 mg with Lasilix 20 mg. In France, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is a set of recommendations aiming to ensure a high quality standard for clinical trials. To put these recommendations into practice within the context of a large study of Triatec, national and local structures were implemented for a computer-assisted follow-up. Real-time data control for the 770 patients enrolled in this trial made a first presentation of the results to the Scientific Committee possible a mere 10 weeks after the last visit of the last patient was recorded. It also ensured the most reliable data to be processed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "104": "The existence of tissue renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been widely suggested in the recent literature by 2 main approaches: first, a dissociation between antihypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the levels of stimulation of the circulating RAS; secondly, by the demonstration of the presence of the 3 key-proteins of the system (angiotensinogen, creatinine, and converting enzyme) within the 3 main target-organs of hypertension (i.e. kidney, heart and vessels). Those organs are capable to synthetize locally angiotensin II. Ramipril, a new ACE inhibitor (Triatec), which possesses a high affinity for tissue CE of those organs, according to previous publications by Unger, has been used as a tool for the investigations of the inhibition of those systems in human hypertension: a decrease of micro proteinuria has been without antihypertensive effects. In binephrectomized patients, ramipril has been shown to possess an antihypertensive effect. Finally, an important improvement of myocardial hypertrophy has been shown in hypertensive patients. Furthermore, this effect has been observed in animals (rats with aortic stenosis) even with low doses without antihypertensive effects. Further studies with new methodological approaches are still necessary.", 
    "105": "The safety and efficacy of a thiazide/potassium-sparing diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used concomitantly was evaluated in a large, multicenter study. Aldactazine was administered alone for 2 months, after which time captopril was added in those whose blood pressure had not normalized (332 patients). At the end of the 6-month study, control of blood pressure was achieved in 88% of the patients with one or the other regimen. No clinically significant changes were recorded for a number of biologic parameters. Specifically, there was 1 case of hyperkalemia (6 mmol/liter), a very low incidence of hypotension (1.6%), and a low rate of adverse effects. Therefore, such a combination could provide important therapeutic benefits in hypertensive patients.", 
    "106": "The addition of enalapril or acebutolol to a regimen of altizide + spironolactone in patients with moderate hypotension was investigated in a multicenter study of 53 patients. The patients underwent semiambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, especially to observe hypotensive episodes. In the 25 patients uncontrolled with altizide + spironolactone alone, enalapril and acebutolol were about equally effective in reducing blood pressure. The incidence of hypotension was low and comparable for both treatment groups, provided that the initial dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was low (5 mg).", 
    "107": "The safety and antihypertensive effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination form of spironolactone + altizide (S/A) were compared with those of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 186 patients with moderate essential hypertension. The 2 treatment groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, duration and severity of hypertension, diastolic blood pressure (BP), serum potassium and creatinine, and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion after a 4-week washout phase. After 8 weeks of treatment, both S/A and enalapril decreased BP significantly and to about the same extent. Enalapril, however, was more effective in decreasing supine diastolic BP in patients younger than age 50, whereas S/A yielded better results in those older than 50. Laboratory values were similar after both drugs were administered, and there were no clinically significant changes. The study demonstrated that S/A safely reduces elevated BP, particularly in older patients.", 
    "108": "Various gastrin analogues and CCK-8 (Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) are hydrolyzed in vitro by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the main and initial cleavage occurring at the Met-Asp (or Leu-Asp) bond, releasing the C-terminal dipeptide amide Asp-Phe-NH2. Tetragastrin analogues (e.g., Boc-Trp-Leu-Asp-Phe-NH2) are degraded by a vesicular membrane fraction from rat gastric mucosa, yielding the C-terminal dipeptide Asp-Phe-NH2. We report here on the degradation of gastrin analogues and CCK-8 by a gastric mucosal cell preparation containing specific gastrin receptors. We have shown that gastrin analogues were specifically degraded by gastric mucosal cells from different species (e.g., rabbit and dog) at 37 degrees C (pH 7.4), releasing the C-terminal dipeptide Asp-Phe-NH2, similarly to ACE. This cleavage was found to be temperature and pH sensitive, and was inhibited by metalloproteinase inhibitors and by captopril, strongly suggesting that this enzymatic system closely resembles ACE. We have also demonstrated that a close correlation seems to exist between the apparent affinity of the gastrin analogues for gastrin receptors on gastric mucosal cells, and their ability of being hydrolyzed by this cell preparation. Moreover, all gastrin analogues which have been demonstrated to act as gastrin antagonists remained unaffected in the incubation conditions.", 
    "109": "Until now the pathomechanism of pulmonary heart disease is insufficiently elucidated. Therefore, at present, rational therapeutical concepts are possible only in chronic obstructive lung diseases. Without any modification, the principle of comprehensive treatment of the basic pulmonary disease remains valid. In the symptomatic therapy of the pulmonary heart disease, in first place the long-term oxygen therapy becomes mandatory. Treatment with vasodilatory drugs remains in the long-term activity disappointing. Reasonable expectations are directed to clinical trials of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors. Cardiac glycosides remain reserved for manifest cardiac failure. The stabilization of the acid-base-balance is of great importance for the efficacy of treatment. The decision on the use of additives depends upon a critical evaluation of the actual clinical state and upon the consideration of the risks from polymorbidity.", 
    "110": "By the introduction of the vasodilators into the therapy of the cardiac insufficiency particularly by the application of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors advance could be obtained with regard the peripheral resistance which is always made evident as a sequel of the vasoconstriction in severe cardiac insufficiency the application of vasodilating substances (venous or arterial) leads to a relief of the heart with increase of the cardiac output, decrease of the congestion symptoms and partly amelioration of the exercise tolerance. Whereas all vasodilating substances show these effects in the acute experiment, in the long-term application due to the tolerance development no significant haemodynamic and clinical amelioration is to be made evident any more, with the exception of the ACE-inhibitors. Only the combination of nitrates and hydralazine showed favourable results with regard to the survival time. The therapy with ACE-inhibitors is, when they is used in an expert way and aimed, the hitherto most conducive one to success which has only slight side-effects. Because of the present knowledge all patients with a cardiac insufficiency of the degrees of severity III and IV, perhaps already beginning with degree of severity II, should, in addition to glycosides and diuretics, be treatment with ACE-inhibitors, so far as no contraindication or intolerability are present. Otherwise an experiment with nitrates plus hydralazine is justified.", 
    "111": "A rational therapy of the chronic cardiac insufficiency should be performed according to a certain scheme, in which case the knowledge of the basic disease is necessary for the causal treatment. Apart from the general measures the medicamentous therapy is of particular significance. Hereby up to now the digitalis glycosides remained the remedy of primary choice. They are without doubt indicated in the latent and manifest cardiac insufficiency, consequently from the transition of the NYHA stage II into stage III, in tachycardiac disturbances of rhythm also without cardiac insufficiency in form of auricular fibrillation and auricular flutter as well as in the paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Prophylactic, preoperative applications of glycosides and such ones which are performed only for reasons of age are not justified. Also a maintenance therapy is in most cases no more necessary after removal of the cause of the cardiac insufficiency. - Diuretics are to be used in an insufficiency which continues existing despite application of glycosides. Their application must be performed as protracted as possible. - The therapies with vasodilators, such as prazosin, hydralazine and nitrates, which were performed during the last years, showed, indeed, initial success, but no long-term effect. Another fact it is, however, with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and enalapril, which are to be regarded as second grade medicaments in combination with glycosides and diuretics. Whether or not they will supersede the glycosides, is at present still an open question. Other positively inotropic medicaments which in comparison to the glycosides show a larger therapeutic breadth are still being developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "112": "Positive correlation between systolic blood pressure and plasma renin substrate was demonstrated in Wistar-Kyoto rats when plasma renin substrate was reduced to within a range of 18 and 88% of control values with varying amounts of ramipril. When ramipril was given in amounts that had a maximum effect on systolic blood pressure, marked changes in erythropoietin, reticulocyte count and hematocrit % were observed. Consistent blood pressure-lowering effect was evident for several weeks after ramipril withdrawal. Furthermore, blood pressure obtained 3 days after the rats were taken off ramipril correlated positively with the hematocrit % measured while the rats were still on ramipril (r = 0.83; P less than 0.001). Mean blood volume of 17 rats receiving ramipril was similar to that of the 10 control rats. Plasma and renal renin substrate were highly and positively correlated (r = 0.86; P less than 0.001). Inasmuch as plasma renin substrate is rate-limiting for angiotensin I, it may reflect intrarenal AII and prove to be a useful clinical assessment of converting enzyme inhibition. The increased levels of renin, renin substrate and packed cell volume seen in rats fed Purina basal diet (10% fat) as compared with rats fed Purina lab chow (4.5% fat), support the working hypothesis that intrarenal angiotensin II controls both blood pressure and erythropoiesis.", 
    "113": "All antianginal drugs except nitrates are also first-line antihypertensive drugs. Their antianginal efficacy has not been evaluated in relation to pretreatment blood pressure. They may aggravate ischemia due to excessive reduction in blood pressure. Until the results of direct comparative studies are available, it is advisable to start treatment of angina pectoris in normotensive and hypotensive patients with other drugs that do not primarily decrease blood pressure. Nitrates are a reasonable choice.", 
    "114": "Lung injury induced by phospholipase A2 (PLA2, 0.046 IU/ml perfusate) was studied in a continuous weighing system of isolated perfused guinea pig lungs. The results revealed that lung weight increased progressively during the 30-min perfusion of PLA2. No change of pulmonary arterial pressure was observed in the same period. Albumin permeability-surface area product, lung index, lung water content, exudate from pleura, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme activity increased significantly at the end of 30 min PLA2 perfusion. p-Bromophenacyl bromide, a PLA2 inhibitor, may block the above changes nearly completely. The effects of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin, IM), lipoxygenase (diethylcarbamaxine, DE), and platelet-activating factor (SRI 63-441) on PLA2-induced lung injury were also studied. We found: (1) PLA2 may induce high permeability lung edema. The role of endothelial injury in the permeability change remains to be further investigated. (2) DE ameliorated lung injury significantly within 10 min of PLA2 treatment but showed no effect after 15 min. IM ameliorated lung injury during the whole experimental period. SRI 63-441 had no effect. It is suggested that PLA2 may damage lung by inducing products of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase besides its direct effect.", 
    "115": "There is increasing evidence that activation of the plasma contact system that results in the production of bradykinin plays an important role in contrast material systemic reactions. The effects of bradykinin in anaphylaxis depend on its rate of destruction and its rate of production. The highest percentage of contrast material reactions occur after intravenous injections, and the major enzyme hydrolyzing bradykinin (kininase II; angiotensin-converting enzyme) is found on pulmonary vascular endothelial surfaces. The inhibitory effects of numerous ionic and nonionic contrast material solutions on the enzyme have been determined. Additionally, the role in this inhibition of the chelators found in all commercial contrast material vials has been studied. In vitro, all such preparations combined with their chelators inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme. Whether this inhibition plays a role in vivo remains to be established.", 
    "116": "A series of molecules 1 having sulfonamide diuretic moieties covalently linked to non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were prepared and tested for both activities. IC50 values for ACEI as low as 7 nM were observed. Discernable diuretic activity was seen for several hydrochlorothiazide-based molecules. Effects of the ACEI and diuretic structures on the respective potencies are discussed.", 
    "117": "The hemodynamic effects of a converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI) given during 12 consecutive hours were studied in severe chronic renal hypertensive and normotensive Wistar rats. Hemodynamic parameters were obtained by thermodilution method in conscious unrestrained animals twenty-four hours after surgery. A bolus of CEI induced a significant decrease of mean arterial pressure (MAP) (from 192.2 +/- 8.2 to 163.3 +/- 5.9 mmHg, p less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (from 7.69 +/- 0.53 to 5.83 +/- 0.33 mmHg.min/ml 100 g) in hypertensive animals. Cardiac index (CI) and heart rate increased significantly (p less than 0.05). Infusion of CEI to hypertensive animals during 12 consecutive hours produced a further progressive decrease in MAP and TPR (p less than 0.05) and an increase in CI (p less than 0.05). Heart rate did not change. Acute and prolonged infusions of CEI to normotensive group induced less but similar effect to those observed in hypertensive group. These results suggest that an increase of the renin-angiotensin system activity is the principal mechanism involved in the maintenance of high blood pressure during chronic phase of renal hypertension on the rats.", 
    "118": "The effect of enalapril was evaluated in 67 patients with essential hypertension, and its therapeutic efficacy was compared with atenolol in a placebo run-in, single-blind, cross-over trial. Enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure in all grades of essential hypertension. As monotherapy it 'normalized' blood pressure in 88%, 50% and 25% of patients with mild, moderate and severe hypertension respectively. Optimal dose for most of the patients was 20 to 40 mg/day. Comparison with atenolol revealed almost parallel efficacy of the two drugs, although enalapril produced a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in patients with mild and moderate hypertension (P less than 0.01 in each group). No serious side effects were encountered with either drug. Enalapril, therefore, has a potent and slightly superior antihypertensive effect to that of atenolol, and may be used as a 'first-step' drug in the treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "119": "Long-term clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have demonstrated that diuretic-based therapy consistently reduced fatal and non-fatal cerebrovascular events regardless of age, race or gender; the frequency of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy and progression of hypertension were also reduced, and cardiomegaly and ECG left ventricular hypertrophy were reversed. A case can be made for initiating antihypertensive therapy whenever diastolic blood pressure remains greater than or equal to 90 mmHg despite a fair trial of non-pharmacologic treatment. Elderly patients with diastolic hypertension benefit from diuretic-based therapy at least until the age of 80 years. Whether ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers are more effective than diuretics in preventing cardiovascular complications remains to be seen. So far, there have been no long-term trials using these agents as initial therapy.", 
    "120": "Using a bradykinin enzyme immunoassay, we measured the amount of kinin in the peritoneal washings of mice with the kaolin-induced writhing reaction. Simultaneous treatment with captopril, a kininase II inhibitor, significantly increased the kinin level at 1 min after kaolin injection. Soybean trypsin inhibitor injected simultaneously with kaolin almost completely suppressed the kinin level at 1 min with or without treatment of captopril. These results suggest that kinin is released through activation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system by kaolin, and that kinin could be a main mediator for the writhing reaction.", 
    "121": "TA-6366 and its active metabolite 6366A inhibited swine renal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity with IC50s of 9900 and 2.6 nM, respectively. TA-6366 (0.05-0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the angiotensin I (AT-I)-induced pressor response in rats. 6366A augmented bradykinin (BK)-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum more potently than captopril. However, when the augmentation on BK-induced hypotension in rats was used as an indicator, TA-6366 was less active than captopril. TA-6366 increased plasma renin activity and plasma AT-I concentration. Oral administration of TA-6366 lowered the blood pressure in two-kidney one-clip renal hypertensive rats at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) at 2 to 10 mg/kg. The antihypertensive effect of TA-6366 was approximately 5 times more potent than that of captopril and almost as potent as that of enalapril. In SHRs, the antihypertensive action of TA-6366 was intensified in potency when administered repeatedly. The duration of action was longer than those of captopril and enalapril. However, TA-6366 had no substantial effect on the blood pressure in DOCA/saline hypertensive rats. These results indicate that TA-6366 is a potent and long lasting antihypertensive agent and that its antihypertensive action is attributable to the inhibition of ACE.", 
    "122": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) was estimated in 30 patients with aluminium phosphide (AIP) poisoning (study group) admitted in shock. Ten patients in shock other than due to AIP poisoning (Group II A) and 20 normal healthy subjects (Group II B) served as controls. The PRA was significantly higher in the study group and group II A as compared to normal healthy subjects (p less than 0.001). Significantly higher PRA was found in the study group as compared to Group II A (p less than 0.001). The initial higher PRA continued to rise further in the study group but it started decreasing in Group II A as the duration of shock advanced. Continuation of shock in AIP poisoning was probably due to slow release of toxic PH3 gas, which was detected by positive silver nitrate paper test. The rise in PRA was directly proportional to the dose of pesticide consumed. There was direct relationship of mortality with increased PRA. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a role in combating shock in AIp poisoning.", 
    "123": "The long-term effect of enalapril (group 1) and captopril (group 2) on clinical symptomatology and left ventricular function was evaluated in 29 patients with severe congestive heart failure (13 ischemic and 12 dilated cardiomyopathy, four valvular heart disease). During the 6-month observation period, five patients died (two on enalapril and three on captopril therapy = 6-month mortality rate 18%). Nine patients showed no beneficial effect of enalapril or captopril on clinical and hemodynamic findings (= nonresponders). The initial findings on these nine patients were, however, not significantly different from the clinical and hemodynamic findings on the patients who improved. Enalapril had to be discontinued in two patients because of side effects (progressive renal failure and gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively). A total of 22 patients completed the study, 11 treated with enalapril (mean dosage 25 +/- 10 mg/day) and 11 treated with captopril (mean dosage 77 +/- 26 mg/day). After 6 months there was a significant improvement according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, from 2.4 to 1.9 in group 1 (p less than 0.01) and from 2.7 to 1.9 in group 2 (p less than 0.001). The cardio-thoracic ratio (chest x-ray) decreased significantly from 0.59 to 0.56 (p less than 0.001) in group 1 and from 0.56 to 0.53 (p less than 0.001) in group 2. Physical working capacity (bicycle ergometry) showed a significant increase in both groups from 61% to 81% in group 1 (p less than 0.01) and from 66% to 83% in group 2 (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "124": "Previous studies have demonstrated the high prevalence of frequent and complex ventricular arrhythmias in patients with severe congestive heart failure. It has been claimed that these arrhythmias are independent risk factors of prognosis. Moreover in severely depressed left ventricular function frequent and repetitive arrhythmias may deteriorate the hemodynamic situation. Recent clinical studies have drawn increasing attention to the possibility that the desired therapeutic effect of Class I antiarrhythmic agents may be complicated by their ability to aggravate the arrhythmia or to provoke new arrhythmias. These \"proarrhythmical effects\" were more frequent in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias and in those with severely depressed left ventricular function. Prevention trials with Class I antiarrhythmic agents have failed to show beneficial effects on the arrhythmia profile and on the prognosis of those patients. On the other hand, it is now well recognized that the incidence of cardiac death can be reduced by the use of ACE-inhibitors in this patient population. Accordingly, there is evidence of a reduced incidence of complex ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with these drugs in some of the patients with congestive heart failure. The influence of digitalis on the arrhythmia profile and the cardiac mortality in these patients is still a matter of debate. On the other hand, there is evidence that newer positive inotropic agents such as phosphodiesterase-inhibitors rather increase the number of arrhythmias and the prevalence of sudden cardiac death in this patient population.", 
    "125": "A decrease in cardiac output in patients with congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy is compensated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The increase in plasma norepinephrine and depletion of norepinephrine in the myocardium as well as the disturbance of beta-adrenal and baroreceptor function reflect the limits of the sympathetic nervous stimulation. Together with augmented levels of angiotensin II and vasopressin, this stimulation leads to a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance. Sustained stimulation of at least one of these mechanisms can cause further impairment of the left ventricular function. The severity and prognosis of congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy is expressed by the plasma norepinephrine concentration and by its myocardial depletion. Ultimately, activation of the compensatory mechanisms provides the basis for therapeutic approaches: 1. reduction of afterload and systemic vascular resistance and/or 2. diminution of the sympathetic nervous activity. For about the last ten years, ACE inhibitors have been used as pharmacological treatment in addition to positive inotropic and vasodilating substances. Captopril, one of the first orally applicable drugs, reduces left ventricular filling pressure, pulmonary capillary pressure, systemic vascular resistance and increases the cardiac output. Beside the hemodynamic improvement, a decrease in plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone can be observed. Vasodilators and alpha-blocking agents can also reduce afterload and systemic vascular resistance in patients with congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, and may lead to hemodynamic improvement. The main limitations of their long-term application are relatively short duration of action, reflex activation of the renin-angiotensin system due to vasodilation and induction of tolerance.", 
    "126": "Challenge to a new therapeutic principle to treat heart failure is to ameliorate or eliminate symptoms, decelerate progression of the disease and reduce mortality. However, to begin, one would request improvement of objective hemodynamic parameters. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have acute and chronic, global and regional effects. ACE inhibitors acutely and chronically reduce pre- and afterload without reflex tachycardia. They lower myocardial oxygen consumption and improve the relation of coronary blood flow to myocardial oxygen consumption. Cerebral and renal blood flow generally are beneficially influenced if the blood pressure is not lowered too much. Left ventricular dilatation following extensive myocardial infarction which is prognostically unfavourable, may be retarded or prevented by ACE-inhibitors. It is not yet clear whether mortality may thus be reduced as in patients with severe heart failure. Large multicenter studies currently address this question. It is unclear as well whether the effects of ACE-inhibitors are exclusively due to a reduction of circulating angiotensin II. Most likely, interference is of major importance with local renin-angiotensin systems, other hormone systems and the central and peripheral nervous system.", 
    "127": "Pinacidil is an orally administered antihypertensive drug that acts via direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle to produce peripheral vasodilatation and a reduction in blood pressure without significant direct effects on cardiac electrophysiology. Pinacidil is unrelated to other antihypertensive drugs in clinical use, either in structure or mechanism of action. It belongs to a new class of agents called 'potassium channel openers' which act via potassium efflux to hyperpolarize cell membranes, indirectly causing a net reduction in intracellular calcium that leads to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Pinacidil is indicated in the management of essential hypertension. In clinical trials of up to 1 year duration, pinacidil administered twice daily in a controlled release capsule formulation has been shown to achieve adequate blood pressure control both in previously untreated patients and in those with blood pressure inadequately controlled by beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs or thiazide diuretics. In long term (up to 1 year) comparative studies pinacidil was at least as effective as hydralazine, prazosin or nifedipine in maintaining blood pressure control. Pinacidil may also have a potential use in the treatment of patients with secondary renal hypertension. Clinical trials to date have usually allowed the addition of a thiazide diuretic and/or beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug to enhance the efficacy of pinacidil and/or to reduce the incidence of adverse effects. The main adverse effects of pinacidil treatment, which result from its peripheral vasodilator activity, are headache, oedema, palpitations and tachycardia. Although the overall incidence of adverse effects is quite high, they are usually mild, transient in nature and respond to a reduction in dose. Nevertheless, these effects may occasionally be severe, necessitating withdrawal from therapy. Thus, pinacidil is an effective antihypertensive drug for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Despite its novel mechanism of action pinacidil causes adverse effects typical of peripheral vasodilators; during long term use with twice daily administration of the controlled release capsule formulation, the addition of a diuretic is often necessary to attenuate peripheral oedema and maintain adequate control of blood pressure. Further long term controlled trials are needed to determine the precise role of pinacidil relative to that of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blocking drugs.", 
    "128": "This study examined the effects of magnesium on changes in blood pressure and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) elicited by angiotensin II in rats. The infusion of angiotensin II (0.1 nmol/kg/min) for 30 min increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PAC. Simultaneous infusion of magnesium sulphate (5 mumols/kg/min) attenuated the MAP elevation (157.0 +/- 5.2 (SE) v 141.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, P less than .01) and the increase in PAC (447 +/- 70 v 233 +/- 50 pg/mL, P less than .01) brought about by angiotensin II. These effects of magnesium were abolished when endogenous angiotensin II was suppressed by the administration of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The results suggest that magensium may attenuate the biological actions of angiotensin II.", 
    "129": "The present single-blind, randomised, cross-over, placebo-controlled study was set up to compare the first-dose effects upon blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF, measured by Xenon inhalation) of a single oral dose of atenolol 50 mg and enalapril 5 mg in ten hypertensive patients receiving a thiazide diuretic. It was found that a) the timing and degree of fall in BP after the first dose of atenolol and enalapril on a diuretic background were similar and generally not associated with symptoms or a fall in CBF, and b) dizziness, which is sometimes associated with the first-dose effect of ACE inhibitors in hypertensives on diuretics, can occasionally occur accompanied by a substantial fall (43%) in CBF in the absence of marked falls in systolic blood pressure. It is suggested that the latter event may be linked to a disturbance of cerebral autoregulation in part dependent on localised renin-angiotensin systems.", 
    "130": "This randomized, double-blind parallel study compared the effects of atenolol, captopril, enalapril and propranolol in 360 men with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were titrated until diastolic blood pressure (Korotkoff phase V) decreased by at least 10 mmHg or to 90 mmHg or less. Quality of life assessments, based on validated psychometric questionnaires and objective measurements of cognitive function, occurred after three study phases: placebo run-in (3-5 weeks), titration (1-4 weeks), and maintenance (4 weeks). After four weeks of maintenance therapy, atenolol, captopril and enalapril generally had equivalent effects on quality of life, as measured by psychometric questionnaires, whereas propranolol consistently evidenced worsening or less improvement. Global scores of distressing psychological symptoms differed as a function of specific treatment (P = 0.01), with improvements significantly better for the atenolol, captopril and enalapril groups as compared with the propranolol group. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for changes in cognitive function at maintenance. Thus, the quality of life questionnaires differentiated among drugs of the same class, indicating that selection among antihypertensive drugs should be based on their specific qualities, not on general class characteristics.", 
    "131": "Arterial baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) was compared in nonpregnant (NP) and near-term pregnant (P) chloralose-anesthetized rats. Baroreflex curves were obtained by recording reflex changes in RSNA (expressed as a percent of base line) due to increases and decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) [intravenous phenylephrine and nitroprusside (NTP)]. The slope, midpoint (EP50), and threshold pressures of the baroreflex curves were compared. Base-line MAP was significantly lower in the pregnant animals (P = 96 +/- 3 vs. NP = 113 +/- 5 mmHg). The baroreflex curves of pregnant animals also had significantly lower threshold (P = 95 +/- 3 vs. NP = 110 +/- 5 mmHg) and midpoint values (P = 105 +/- 4 vs. NP = 119 +/- 5 mmHg). The response to unloading the baroreceptors was attenuated in the pregnant animals as indicated by a decrease in slope of the NTP portion of the baroreflex curve (P = 0.95 +/- 0.17 vs. NP = 1.61 +/- 0.29% nerve activity/mmHg). Responses to blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme with captopril (2 mg/kg iv) were also examined. There were no differences in EP50 or slope among the control, captopril, and recovery baroreflex curves within either the nonpregnant or pregnant animals. However, after captopril, MAP decreased to a greater extent in the pregnant rats, yet RSNA increased to the same level for the two groups. Thus pregnancy results in a leftward shift of the baroreflex function curve toward a lower operating pressure range. In addition, pregnant rats demonstrated an impaired ability to increase sympathetic outflow above base-line values in response to a hypotensive challenge.", 
    "132": "Influence of captopril on urinary excretion of furosemide was examined in a placebo-controlled, crossover design. Furosemide (20 mg) was injected intravenously in eight hypertensive subjects with pretreatment with captopril (25 mg) or matching placebo. Urine samples for furosemide and sodium were collected during the following intervals: -60-0, 0-60, 60-120, and 120-180 minutes after furosemide. Blood samples for plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin II (AII) were obtained, and blood pressure was measured at -60, 0, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after furosemide. No significant difference was observed in urinary excretion of furosemide, volume or sodium between these trials. Although PRA increased following furosemide with captopril, as predicted plasma AII did not increase. Blood pressure significantly decreased following the combined therapy, but not furosemide alone. These data indicate that the urinary excretion of furosemide and its subsequent diuretic effects are not influenced by captopril.", 
    "133": "In recent years there has been increased discussion about goals of antihypertensive therapy other than blood pressure reduction. The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has provided a class of drugs with a very low side-effect profile. However, single-drug therapy is effective in only about half of hypertensive patients. In the past, diuretics have traditionally been used as the initial or second antihypertensive. Increasingly, diuretic therapy is being avoided, and other antihypertensive combinations are being used. In controlled trials, combination converting enzyme inhibitor-diuretic therapy is effective in about 85% of patients. This synergistic combination allows the diuretic dose to be reduced so that the adverse effects and metabolic complications are minimized. At this time, the combination of converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretic provides an ideal choice in terms of efficacy, compliance, side effects, and cost.", 
    "134": "Hypertension occurs with twice the frequency in the diabetic population as compared with the general nondiabetic population. Treatment of hypertension in diabetics can be complicated by diabetic complications and the potential for adverse effects from selected antihypertensive drugs. A rational approach to antihypertensive therapy in diabetics with or without concurrent diabetic complications incorporates a \"stepped\" approach to therapy that includes alternative step 1 agents (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers) rather than traditional agents (eg, diuretics and beta-blockers). Evolving evidence with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reveals that they do not exacerbate complications of diabetes mellitus and also may arrest or slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment algorithms for a stepped approach to the management of the hypertensive diabetic patient are proposed.", 
    "135": "The changes in arterial blood pressure and plasma cortisol concentration in response to exogenous angiotensin II (AII) and to manipulation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been examined in the flounder, Platichthys flesus. Intravenous [Asp1Val5]AII was pressor in a dose-dependent manner over the range of 0.25-250 micrograms/kg. Sequential blood sampling revealed steroidogenic stimulation, measured as change in plasma cortisol concentration, by doses of AII greater than 2.5 micrograms/kg. Enhanced circulating cortisol levels were measured some time after recovery of normal systemic blood pressure, suggesting that the change in plasma steroid concentration was not entirely dependent on the change in systemic blood pressure. Administration of the vasodilator papaverine produced immediate hypotension followed by gradual recovery in blood pressure, which was accompanied by a sustained increment in circulating cortisol. Both blood pressure recovery and the increased plasma steroid concentration were inhibited by prior treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. These results are consistent with a physiologically important role for the RAS in the control of plasma cortisol levels which complements its demonstrated pressor and dipsogenic actions in the flounder: the RAS may thus afford an integrating influence on the mechanisms of body fluid homeostasis in this euryhaline species.", 
    "136": "Quinapril hydrochloride, a new, orally active, nonpeptide, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, has been studied extensively in a variety of in vitro and in vivo animal models. Quinapril inhibits the contractile and pressor effects of angiotensin I in rabbit aorta and in rats, respectively, and lowers blood pressure in both high- and normal-renin rodent and diuretic-treated dog models of hypertension. No tolerance to the antihypertensive effects of quinapril was noted in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with quinapril for up to 14 consecutive days. As with other ACE inhibitors, quinapril had virtually no effect on the development of hypertension in the renin-independent one-kidney deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rat. Antihypertensive activity best correlates with the inhibition of tissue (vascular) ACE, and thus the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance associated with plasma and tissue ACE most likely accounts for the therapeutic benefit of quinapril. Preliminary data from a trial of quinapril in cardiomyopathic hamsters show that the drug prevents the anticipated decline in left ventricular contractile function and retards the temporal progression of left ventricular failure. ACE inhibitors have been found to have a lipid-neutral profile, unlike some other classes of antihypertensives. Quinapril is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed to all tissues except brain. It is rapidly hydrolyzed to quinaprilat, its pharmacologically active diacid form. Metabolism to other compounds is not extensive. Quinapril's preclinical toxicologic profile is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Long-term toxicology studies show that quinapril is not teratogenic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic.", 
    "137": "Several experimental models have been studied to determine the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing ischemic and reperfusion arrhythmias. Studies of left main coronary artery occlusion in isolated perfused rat hearts have shown that the ACE inhibitor captopril reduced reperfusion ventricular fibrillation from 100% to 0% and was associated with a reduction in purine overflow and in norepinephrine release. These effects were abolished in the presence of indomethacin. In an anesthetized rat model of acute myocardial infarction (MI), ACE inhibition reduced mean duration of ventricular fibrillation from 1,133 to 135. ACE inhibition at programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in a closed-chest pig model of acute MI reduced the inducibility of sustained, reproducible ventricular tachycardia from a mean of 42 to 8%. In this model, ventricular tachycardia could not be provoked in animals treated with captopril from the time of acute ischemia. Studies on the rate of ventricular ectopy in patients with poor left ventricular function have demonstrated a significant reduction with ACE inhibition. However, while a protective effect has been shown, the mechanism of action is still speculative.", 
    "138": "The effects of antihypertensive therapy on the atherosclerotic process and differences among various treatment approaches have been studied in several animal models. Studies in cholesterol-fed rabbits have indicated that beta blockers and calcium antagonists can inhibit the development of aortic atherosclerosis induced by marked hypercholesterolemia. However, no such antiatherosclerotic action has been apparent with these agents in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit. A study was conducted to determine the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril administered orally for 9 months on the development of atherosclerosis in normotensive WHHL. Compared with controls, the treated animals had a significant reduction in atherosclerosis of the descending thoracic aorta. These effects were associated with significantly lower blood pressure, though within the normal range, in captopril-treated versus control animals. In the captopril group, the atherosclerotic plaques were thinner and less cellular than plaques of similar gross severity in control WHHL. The findings indicate that the ACE inhibitor captopril can inhibit atherogenesis in the WHHL, which has been resistant to such therapy with other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "139": "The safety of quinapril hydrochloride, a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with an intermediate duration of action, has been evaluated in 3,031 patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF) and has been compared with other ACE inhibitors. A comparison of double-blind studies showed quinapril to have a lower incidence of adverse effects and withdrawals than reported for captopril or enalapril. Analysis of onset of adverse events or withdrawals did not show either a time-dependent or dose-dependent relationship with quinapril. The proportion of patients who experienced orthostatic hypotension was less than that of patients on captopril or enalapril. Double-blind, long-term, and open-label studies with quinapril showed no increase in the incidence of events reported in patients with CHF compared with hypertensive patients. Quinapril produced minimal adverse effects on renal function in both patients with normal renal function and in those with pre-existing renal impairment. Age analysis of data from all studies showed no increase in total reporting of adverse events in older patients who did not take concomitant diuretics.", 
    "140": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF). Abnormal activation of the RAAS adversely affects cardiac performance and impairs functional status, increasing both afterload and preload through direct and indirect mechanisms. Conventional first-line therapy for CHF consists of diuretics and/or digitalis. Diuretics offer rapid relief of symptoms, effective volume control, and ease of administration, but are associated with a number of disadvantages, including further activation of neurohormonal systems resulting in augmented vasoconstriction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the RAAS by inhibiting production of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, are emerging as the vasodilators of choice in combination with diuretics with or without concomitant digitalis. Direct comparative studies have shown that ACE inhibitors provide acute and long-term symptomatic, hemodynamic, and exercise-related benefits as well as improved functional class and, possibly, slowed progression of disease with enhanced survival in specific subgroups. Captopril was the first orally effective ACE inhibitor associated with improved exercise tolerance and functional class in large multicenter trials of patients with severe heart failure and mild to moderate heart failure. Enalapril reduced the probability of death in patients with severe heart failure in the CONSENSUS trial. The new ACE inhibitor quinapril has been shown to improve hemodynamic status both acutely and chronically and to produce dose-related improvements in exercise tolerance. ACE inhibitors have a favorable safety profile, although hypotension can occur with initial doses, particularly in volume-depleted patients or at times when excessive initial doses are administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "141": "Major studies comparing the efficacy and safety of quinapril and captopril in the treatment of moderate to severe or severe hypertension are reviewed. Given concurrently with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day to patients with moderate to severe hypertension, quinapril 20-80 mg/day twice daily was found to be more effective than captopril 50-200 mg/day twice daily, and quinapril 10-40 mg/day once daily was found to be as effective as captopril 25-100 mg/day twice daily. Given as initial monotherapy to patients with severe hypertension, quinapril 10-40 mg/day twice daily was found to be as effective as captopril 50-200 mg/day twice daily. Quinapril was found to be well tolerated, both when administered against a diuretic background and when diuretic was added to a quinapril regimen.", 
    "142": "Major clinical trials are reviewed comparing the efficacy and safety of quinapril hydrochloride, a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with that of placebo, captopril, and enalapril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. A randomized, double-blind 12-week study of 270 patients compared the efficacy of placebo with once or twice daily doses of quinapril (20, 40, 80 mg/day, with forced titration). Quinapril effectively lowered both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure. Mean reductions in DBP of up to 13 mmHg from baseline were obtained. At full dosage, more than 65% of patients achieved a clinically significant reduction in DBP. Quinapril was similarly effective whether the total daily dose was given once or twice daily. In a multicenter, double-blind study involving more than 400 patients, the efficacy of quinapril (10-40 mg/day, given once or twice daily) was found to be similar to captopril (25 mg bid to 50 mg tid). Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) safely provided additive effects when given to nonresponders in both treatment groups. In a 28-week double-blind study of 258 patients comparing the efficacy of quinapril or enalapril at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/day (with optional titration), quinapril was found to be of similar efficacy as enalapril. The large majority of patients on either regimen were controlled with monotherapy. HCTZ again safely provided additive effects. Quinapril was well tolerated in all trials, with the incidence of adverse events and withdrawals tending to be lower with quinapril than with enalapril or captopril.", 
    "143": "Quinapril hydrochloride is the newest member of a family of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. On completion of laboratory and animal studies, a clinical program was initiated to evaluate the antihypertensive and other properties of the drug in human subjects. The initial phase of clinical development was concerned with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of quinapril. The latter studies established a dose range for the drug and explored its effect on human hemodynamics and blood pressure. Safety and interactions with other drugs were also examined. Subsequent studies explored the safety and efficacy of quinapril in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and, later, in patients with more severe hypertension. Results of these studies supported the recommendation of a once daily dosage of quinapril, 10-40 mg, as first-line therapy in the management of hypertension, with diuretics as concomitant therapy as required in patients with severe hypertension. Quinapril has also been found to be the most potent of all available ACE inhibitors in binding to tissue ACE, which may contribute to its potent and sustained duration of action. Clinical evaluation of quinapril has also been undertaken in patients with congestive heart failure. Initial findings indicate that doses of 10-20 mg/day, given twice daily, are therapeutic when administered with diuretic or digitalis. Safety of the drug has been established in 2700 patients.", 
    "144": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are used widely in the treatment of both hypertension and congestive heart failure. Although usually well tolerated, these medications may produce side effects that may be encountered by the allergist, including cough, angioedema, and rhinitis symptoms. The severity of ACEI-induced cough may vary, and is associated with increased bronchial hyperreactivity in some (but not all) patients as judged by methacholine sensitivity. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough may have its onset from one day to 12 months after initiation of therapy, and is not dose dependent. Angioedema caused by ACEI is usually mild and clears with discontinuation of the drug, however cases requiring intubation and tracheostomy have been reported. The mechanism of ACEI-induced cough remains unclear, but could be in part due to accumulation of substances whose degradation may also be impeded by ACEI, such as substance P, bradykinins, and/or prostaglandins. Knowledge of the side effects produced by this class of medication may help patients avoid unnecessary, costly, and often invasive diagnostic evaluations.", 
    "145": "Baroreflex function was studied in conscious early phase (less than 6 weeks) two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats before and 24 hours after surgical reversal of hypertension by removal of the constricting renal artery clip or after pharmacological reduction of blood pressure by an infusion of hydralazine or captopril. A normotensive sham-clipped group was included. Another group of two-kidney, one-clip rats was studied 3 weeks after unclipping. Baroreflex sensitivity, as assessed by the steady-state method using a graded phenylephrine infusion, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were measured preoperatively and at 24 hours postoperatively. Two-kidney, one-clip rats were significantly hypertensive preoperatively compared with control (mean arterial pressure, 183 +/- 4 vs. 106 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), heart rate was similar (420 +/- 9 vs. 401 +/- 9 beats/min, p greater than 0.05), and baroreflex sensitivity was significantly reduced (0.76 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.20 msec/mm Hg; p less than 0.001). There was a minimal change in heart rate despite the fall in mean arterial pressure in all hypertensive groups, indicating resetting of the baroreflexes. At 24 hours after the operation, baroreflex sensitivity was unchanged in all groups compared with the preoperative value. By 3 weeks, baroreflex sensitivity was significantly greater than in the hypertensive two-kidney, one-clip rats before the operation and 24 hours after they were unclipped, but not compared with normotensive sham-clipped rats. Thus, although resetting occurs within 24 hours, whatever the method of blood pressure reduction, baroreflex sensitivity remains impaired at this time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "146": "To further study the relationship between endogenous opioid peptides and essential hypertension, we measured the concentrations of plasma leucine-enkephalin (LEK) and beta-endorphin (beta-EP) in 50 patients with essential hypertension by radioimmunoassay and investigated the effects of captopril on them. It was shown that the concentrations of plasma LEK and beta-EP in patients with essential hypertension were lower than those in normotensive subjects. No effects of age and sex were found on the concentrations of plasma LEK and beta-EP, and there was no difference in plasma LEK and beta-EP levels between patients with Stage I essential hypertension and those with Stage II essential hypertension. After a single dose of captopril, blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II decreased, plasma renin activity increased; and plasma LEK and beta-EP levels increased. Plasma LEK and beta-EP levels in patients with essential hypertension increased after one month of captopril treatment. In conclusion, the lower plasma LEK and beta-EP levels in patients with essential hypertension indicate that LEK and beta-EP may play a role in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, and the depressor effects of captopril may act through LEK and beta-EP, besides blocking formation of angiotension II.", 
    "147": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme from bovine lung was isolated by chromatography with a 25-30% yield and purified 2200-2600-fold. The active molecule concentration in the enzyme preparations was 70-100% as could be judged from titration by inhibitor SQ 20,881. The molecular mass of the enzyme according to electrophoretic data is about 132 kDa; the maximal radius of the enzyme molecule as determined by electron microscopy is 68 +/- 9 A. Five enzyme isoforms with pI of 4.85, 4.7, 4.54, 4.38 and 4.3, respectively, were identified. The kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of three synthetic peptide substrates and the constants of activation of the substrate (Z-Phe-His-Leu) hydrolysis by chloride anions were determined.", 
    "148": "A limited number of ectoenzymes appear to be involved in inactivating circulating regulatory peptides. The widely distributed angiotensin-converting enzyme controls the concentration of angiotensin II in the blood, thereby limiting its vasoconstrictor effects. Inhibitors of this enzyme, such as captopril and enalapril, are clinically used as antihypertensives. Neutral endopeptidase-24.11 is known to be involved in inactivating opioid peptides in the CNS and much research has focused on the use of its inhibitors in manipulating endogenous pain-control mechanisms. Recent evidence that this metallopeptidase inactivates atrial natriuretic peptide, summarized here by Bernard Roques and Ann Beaumont, has led to a re-evaluation of the potential use of its inhibitors as novel diuretics and antihypertensive agents.", 
    "149": "1. Urinary albumin excretion and the effect of an acute oral protein load (a meat meal) on glomerular filtration rate ('renal functional reserve') were evaluated in 15 essential hypertensive patients with preserved renal function and compared with 12 normal subjects. 2. Seven patients had microalbuminuria (greater than 30 mg/day) that was not correlated with blood pressure values. 3. After an oral protein load, an average increase of 20% in glomerular filtration rate (from 91 +/- 19 to 110 +/- 27 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 was found in the hypertensive patients. This change was not statistically different from that observed in normal controls (from 102 +/- 7 to 124 +/- 9 ml min-1 1.73 m-2). The glomerular response in hypertensive patients was independent of age, duration of hypertension, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, urinary albumin excretion and retinal vascular alterations. 4. All patients were re-evaluated after 6 weeks treatment with a new orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures were lowered in all the patients, but the drug did not affect the glomerular response to acute protein ingestion or the magnitude of urinary albumin excretion. 5. The findings of a normal 'renal functional reserve' and a lack of change in both urinary albumin excretion and the glomerular response after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition cast doubt on the existence of increased intraglomerular pressure in hypertensive patients.", 
    "150": "The possibility of an impaired hepatic de-esterification of enalapril to enalaprilat due to hepatic dysfunction was assessed in seven patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and 10 normal control subjects. The peak serum concentration and time to the peak serum concentration of enalaprilat, as well as the suppression of serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity, following a single oral dose of enalapril maleate (10 mg) were not different in the two groups. The elimination half-life of enalaprilat was related to renal function. The results suggest that hepatic biotransformation of the drug may not be disturbed in a clinically significant manner in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction due to compensated liver cirrhosis.", 
    "151": "In order to investigate the role of renin angiotensin in the epididymis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) concentrations were measured in the male reproductive tract and blood serum of the rat. High ACE activity was detected in the rat epididymis, with a major part of the activity being associated with epididymal spermatozoa. When spermatozoa were prevented from entering the epididymis by efferent duct ligation, the ACE activity in the epididymis was greatly reduced. The epithelial cells lining the epididymal duct were also shown to possess ACE activity which was dependent upon circulating androgens. Treatment of male rats with captopril at a single oral dose (20 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the ACE activity in the blood serum but had no effect on the activity of the epididymal fluid. The intraluminal ACE was protected from the circulating captopril by the blood-epididymis barrier. Long-term treatment with captopril (20 mg/kg per day, 8 weeks), however, caused an increase in blood serum ACE activity but was without effect on intraluminal ACE. The fertility and fecundity of male rats after treatment were apparently normal. The concentrations of AI and AII were high in the epididymal plasma and epididymal cell when compared with the respective concentrations in blood serum. The intraluminal AII concentration found (13 nmol/l) was close to the threshold concentrations that stimulate anion (and fluid) secretion in cultured epididymal epithelium in vitro. The high intraluminal AII concentration could not have been derived from the testicular fluid or spermatozoa since the rete testis fluid and sperm contained little AII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "152": "Confluent monolayers cultured from the rat cauda epididymidis have been shown to respond to angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) when studied under short-circuit conditions and bathed on both sides with Krebs-Henseleit solution. Both the decapeptide AI and the octapeptide AII elicited transient increases in short-circuit current (SCC) when added to the basolateral as well as to the apical surfaces, with the effect of basolateral application greater than that of apical application. The maximal responses produced by AI and AII were similar with median effective concentrations of 20 to 80 nmol/l. The increase in SCC by AII was dependent upon extracellular Cl- and was inhibited by addition of a Cl- channel blocker, diphenylamine 2-carboxylate, to the apical surface. These patterns of activity suggest that the SCC responses to angiotensins result from electrogenic chloride secretion. Pretreating the monolayers with captopril (100 nmol/l), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced the response to basolateral application of AI, but completely abolished the response to AI added apically. These results suggest that the response to apical addition of AI was due to conversion of AI to AII which interacts with apical angiotensin receptors. This conversion was mediated by ACE which has been detected in epididymal monolayers. Of the endogenous ACE activity, 86% was found to be inhibited by captopril (100 nmol/l). Responses of the epididymal monolayers to angiotensins were mediated by specific angiotensin receptors. [Sar1,Ile8]-AII, a specific antagonist of the AII receptor, completely inhibited the responses to AI and AII but had no effect on the responses to bradykinin and endothelin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "153": "In 1986, the Committee on Safety of Medicines published a report suggesting that enalapril may have an adverse effect on renal function. The prescription event monitoring scheme subsequently published figures on adverse drug reactions and mortality for patients treated with enalapril. They concluded that enalapril did not have an adverse effect on renal function and survival. Similar data were not available for captopril, as the drug was marketed before prescription event monitoring had been developed. In the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) Hypertension Care Computing Project (DHCCP), 368 hypertensive patients treated with captopril and 371 treated with enalapril were followed for an average of 3.1 and 1.6 years, respectively. Thirty-two patients died; none had renal failure as an underlying cause of death. The death rate was similar in both drug groups, at 17.5 (enalapril) and 24.0 (captopril) per 1000 patient-years. The present report shows that, for patients treated for high blood pressure, the relative risk of mortality with captopril compared with enalapril was 1.37, an insignificant difference (95% confidence interval 0.63, 2.98).", 
    "154": "It has been suggested that there is a negative-feedback interaction between the humoral renomedullary antihypertensive system and angiotensin II. If so, the acute blood pressure-lowering effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors might be due, in part, to an increased secretion of renomedullary depressor substances. Groups of anaesthetized Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) with an intact or chemically destroyed renal medulla received either saline or the ACE inhibitor enalapril, and mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate and renal function were measured. MAP was clearly decreased after enalapril administration in the WKY controls with an intact renal medulla, but was not changed in the medullectomized group. In one WKY control group, where the prostaglandin and kallikrein-kinin systems had also been acutely blocked, the MAP reduction after enalapril was even more marked than in the intact controls. Thus, the acute blood pressure-lowering effect of enalapril is clearly dependent on an intact renal medulla, further suggesting that the renomedullary antihypertensive system is important to normal blood pressure homeostasis.", 
    "155": "The production of PGE2 6-keto PGF1 alpha and TxB2 under basal conditions and after exposure to angiotensin II was examined in vitro in isolated glomeruli from sham-operated control rats and rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction of 24 hour duration, that were or were not pretreated with an inhibitor of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). Basal prostanoid production was greater in glomeruli from the obstructed kidney (OK) than in glomeruli from the contralateral kidney (CLK) of rats with obstruction or glomeruli from the kidneys of sham-operated rats. Glomeruli obtained from the CLK of rats with unilateral obstruction also produced more PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha than glomeruli obtained from kidneys of sham-operated rats. Administration of an ACE inhibitor to rats with unilateral obstruction in vivo returned basal prostanoid production in vitro to levels seen in glomeruli of sham-operated rats. The increase in prostanoid production in response to angiotensin II added in vitro was less in glomeruli from rats with unilateral obstruction than in glomeruli from sham-operated rats. However, the response was restored to that seen in glomeruli of sham-operated rats after blockade of angiotensin II synthesis in vivo in rats with unilateral obstruction. Blockade of angiotensin II synthesis in sham-operated rats did not affect prostanoid synthesis by their glomeruli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "156": "Detecting differences in the effect of two antihypertensive agents is bedevilled by the inherent variability of blood pressure itself. Using an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring technique, we compared, in a cross-over design study, the effects of four weeks' treatment with enalapril, 10 mg once daily, to lisinopril, 10 mg once daily, on the blood pressure of 19 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A significant reduction in blood pressure was shown by both drugs. However, lisinopril produced a greater fall in mean 24 hour systolic pressure than did enalapril (difference; 5.94 (C.I. -0.77 to -11.1) mmHg, P = 0.027). The difference of 3.3 mmHg (C.I. +0.54 to -7.10) in diastolic pressure between the two agents, though in the same direction, was not significant. Plasma renin activity did not predict the responses to either agent. Studying the prevailing information for these two drugs one might expect there to be little difference between them when administered once daily in terms of antihypertensive effect. The explanation for the superiority of lisinopril may lie in the slightly longer pharmacokinetic half-life and possibly in differences in tissue distribution or persistence. The side effects of both drugs were mild and of similar frequency to those recorded during placebo treatment, illustrating the generally well tolerated nature of this class of antihypertensive therapy. The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a method that can detect small, but possibly important differences between drugs. In the clinical setting it allows a more thorough assessment of a particular patient's response to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "157": "Ovarian angiotensin I (Ang I)-converting enzyme (ACE), estimated by the specific binding of the ACE inhibitor [125I]iodo-MK-351A, is localized on multiple ovarian structures, including follicular granulosa cells, corpora lutea, terminal epithelium, and ovarian blood vessels, but total ovarian ACE does not display a cyclic pattern of variation during the rat estrous cycle. We have previously shown that ACE is localized on the granulosa cell layer of a subpopulation of rat ovarian follicles. Our present study shows that ovarian granulosa cells contain high affinity [binding site affinity (Kd), approximately 90 pM] and low capacity [binding site density (Bmax), approximately 12 fmol/2.5 X 10(5) cells] [125I]iodo-MK-351A-binding sites and convert [125I]iodo-Ang I to [125I]iodo-Ang II (greater than 85% of this conversion was inhibited by the ACE inhibitor captopril). Throughout the rat estrous cycle, 94-100% of developing follicles and 89-96% of atretic follicles contained high levels of ACE; however, ACE was either not observed or its levels were very low in preovulatory follicles. These findings indicate the presence of high levels of biologically active ACE on the surface of granulosa cells and suggest a potential role for follicular ACE in early stages of follicular maturation and atresia. Although ACE is known to process a variety of peptides found within the ovary, and these peptides may have opposing effects on follicular maturation, we attempted to define the cumulative effect of ACE inhibition on follicular maturation. Short and long term (6- and 14-day) infusions of captopril (6-day, 30.5 +/- 3.5 ova; 14-day, 28.5 +/- 7.5 ova) in immature rats, in which ovulation was induced by sequential treatments with PMSG and hCG, did not significantly affect ovulation compared with that in vehicle-infused control rats (6-day, 22.4 +/- 2.4 ova; 14-day, 20.8 +/- 3.1 ova), suggesting that ACE inhibition does not modify the follicular selection process in a way that affects ovulation. This may explain the lack of any reports of adverse effects of clinically used ACE inhibitors on ovulation.",

At 10 mg/kg iv or ip in the rat, 1a-g inhibited the AI pressor response by 76-100%; inhibition declined significantly upon oral dosing.

    "159": "The effect of a single oral dose (50 mg) of captopril was studied in 12 hypertensive patients divided into 2 groups: 6 had a normal hemodynamic profile; the other 6 had NYHA class III or IV heart failure. Medical history and clinical and laboratory investigation showed that the heart failure was due exclusively to arterial hypertension. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), aldosterone, plasma renin activity (PRA) and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were followed for 4 hours after administration of captopril. MAP values showed a similar decrease in the 2 groups but the variations in the 3 hormones were much greater in the second group. This group showed higher basal levels of PRA, aldosterone and ANF; after stimulation PRA increased sharply preceded by a substantial decrease in aldosterone and ANF. To explain this phenomenon, the Authors propose that the liver of the patients with heart failure is unable to rapidly compensate the reduction in synthesis of angiotensin II caused by the drug with a corresponding increase in angiotensinogen production; the consequent sharp drop in plasma aldosterone would lead to a rise in renin production by the kidney. The arteriolar and venous vasodilatation induced by the ACE-inhibitor, would explain the drop in intra-atrial pressure with reduced plasma levels of ANF. The decrease in ANF could also be caused by the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system of the heart leading to improved blood supply and hence myocardial contractility.",

    "167": "Because left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality considerable interest has been generated concerning the possible effects of modifying LVH in hypertensive patients. In animal models disproportionate regression of left ventricular (LV) mass in relation to blood pressure may produce adverse effects on coronary blood flow reserve or LV systolic function. Clinical studies of modulation of LVH with antihypertensive drug therapy have been of two types: (1) large scale community comparison trials in which the prevalence of LVH and its regression were evaluated serially by electrocardiography (ECG) with stepped care drug therapy and (2) relatively short term (less than 2 years) studies with echocardiographic (ECHO) determination of LVH. The development of anatomically validated measurement of LV muscle mass by ECHO has demonstrated ECHO to be much more sensitive than ECG to assessment of LVH. Community comparison trials of stepped care therapy such as the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) and Hypertension Detection and Followup Study (HDFP) have not had the statistical power to demonstrate significant effects on risk reduction despite evidence for significant decrease in ECG-LVH despite participant numbers in the range of 8,000 to 10,000 followed serially for 5 to 6 years. Analysis of over 60 studies of hypertensive treatment using ECHO for assessment of LVH mass changes, averaging 10 to 15 subjects/study, indicates that correlation of reduction of LV mass with decrease in blood pressure has been weak (r = 0.255, P less than .025). Drug monotherapy studies have shown that use of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors predominantly decrease LV mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "168": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril sodium on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was investigated in 8 patients with moderate essential hypertension. A constant dose of chlorthalidone (25 mg/day) was given to stimulate the renin angiotensin system, and fosinopril sodium was given in incremental doses (10 to 40 mg/day) with the aim of obtaining a diastolic blood pressure at or below 90 mm Hg. Regional CBF was measured with xenon-133 inhalation tomography. Repetitive measurements were made at the start of treatment and again after 4 to 12 weeks treatment in the resting supine position, and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a substitute for the upright position. Four hours after the first 10 mg dose of fosinopril the mean arterial pressure (MAP) had been reduced from 127 +/- 13 mm Hg to 105 +/- 9 mm Hg (P less than .01) without any significant change in mean CBF (55 +/- 9 mL/(100 g X min) at baseline versus 52 +/- 9 mL/(100 g X min) after fosinopril). After prolonged treatment with chlorthalidone and fosinopril, mean CBF was still unchanged from baseline levels, when measured 4 and 24 h after a single dose of fosinopril, despite a 10% reduction in MAP (P less than .01). LBNP did not lead to any significant change in rCBF. The regional distribution of CBF was normal in all patients throughout the study. We conclude that treatment with fosinopril sodium causes a moderate fall in blood pressure without any adverse effects on rCBF.",

The different effects of captopril on blood pressure create 2 groups: a) patients who showed a decrease of blood pressure (n = 14), where a fall of distal resorption of sodium simultaneous with an increase of fractional sodium excretion was registered, and b) patients who did not experience changes in blood pressure nor changes after tubular function tests.",

Patients have been controlled every month during 12 months evaluating: NYHA class, time of exercise at treadmill, ejection time of left ventricle, speed index of ejection, cardiac output, systolic output, ECG, blood pressure, creatinine, BUN and electrolytes. After 12 months a significant increase (p less than 0.001) of systolic and cardiac output in patients with enalapril has been recorded. Also the increase of exercise time was more evident in patients with enalapril (p less than 0.01). The results show that long term treatment with enalapril in patients with congestive heart failure, improving cardiac performance, gives an hemodynamic and symptomatic benefit.", 
    "171": "Angioedema is a disorder characterized by well-demarcated nonpitting edema involving the tongue, floor of the mouth, larynx, lips, and face. This condition can progress to upper airway obstruction and death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), relatively new antihypertensive agents, act by blocking the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone formation. ACEIs also retard the breakdown of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, which may lead to the edema seen in nonhereditary angioedema. These ACEIs include enalapril, captopril, lisinopril, saralasin acetate, and a combination of ACEI with diuretics (for example, Capozide). From August 1987 to January 1989, we treated six patients with a nonhereditary form of angioedema related to ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Symptoms developed in all patients within 12 hours after their initial dose of an ACEI. They presented with shortness of breath and dysphagia associated with tongue and floor of the mouth edema. Two of the six required intubation and monitoring in the surgical intensive care unit for 36 to 48 hours. Three required supportive treatment and observation in an intermediate care unit, and one received supportive care in the clinic and was discharged the same day. Specifically, treatment consisted of cessation of inciting agent, steroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine, if not otherwise contraindicated. Assays of C1 esterase inhibitor levels and C4 were normal in all six patients; this was important in order to rule out hereditary forms of angioedema. These cases will be discussed, including a review of the literature, methods of diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of angioedema.",

This investigation compared the acute hemodynamic changes after sublingual administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril with those after nitroglycerin. A total of 24 patients with severe left heart failure (New York Heart Association classes III and IV) were given 25 mg captopril and 0.8 mg nitroglycerin sublingually in this randomized, cross-over study. Hemodynamic monitoring revealed a clear improvement in pre- and afterload parameters for both drugs (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.001), while captopril induced a higher increase in cardiac index (+49.2% vs. +25%), stroke volume index (+53.5% vs. +25.7%), and stroke work index (+55% vs. +28%) than nitroglycerin (P less than 0.001). Although not statistically significant, the onset of change for most hemodynamic parameters was measured earlier after nitroglycerin (after 12-19 vs. 16-22 minutes). Captopril revealed later peak effects (after 47-84 vs. 25-55 minutes, P less than 0.001) and a longer sustained improvement in hemodynamic values (return to baseline values after 117-162 vs. 68-120 minutes, P less than 0.001). No side effects occurred after either captopril or nitroglycerin in this study. Thus, these results indicate there is an early improvement in hemodynamic parameters after the sublingual administration of both drugs in patients with severe congestive heart failure, and that captopril induces a more pronounced and prolonged improvement than nitroglycerin.",

This inhibitor was also active against monkey renin, although there was less inhibition of renin in pig, rabbit, and rat. ES-8891 did not inhibit cathepsin D, pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, angiotensin converting enzyme, and urinary kallikrein at a concentration of 10(-5) M. A single oral administration of ES-8891 (10 or 30 mg/kg) to conscious, sodium-depleted marmosets caused a dose-related decrease in plasma renin activity and blood pressure. ES-8891 (30 mg/kg) produced an 80% inhibition of plasma renin activity, which lasted for more than 6 hours. Kidney renin messenger RNA was not significantly changed 6 hours after oral administration of ES-8891 (30 mg/kg). A single oral administration of 240 mg ES-8891 to healthy human volunteers (n = 6) produced a significant inhibition of plasma renin activity (75% inhibition at 0.5 and 1 hour, 50% inhibition at 2 hours) with a good correlation of plasma levels of ES-8891. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate, and no adverse effects were observed. These results suggest that ES-8891 is an orally active human renin inhibitor that may be clinically useful.", 
    "174": "The positive inotropic response to angiotensin I and II in cardiac tissue of most mammalian species, as well as the exact site in the heart for conversion of local and systemic angiotensin I into angiotensin II, remains to be elucidated. In isolated cat papillary muscles, angiotensin I and angiotensin II (0.1 nM to 1 microM, 35 degrees C, 1.25 mM Ca2+) increased, in a dose-dependent manner, peak twitch tension with typical slight prolongation of twitch duration. This typical response did not necessitate the presence of an intact endocardial endothelium (EE), as a similar response was observed in muscles where the EE had been damaged by a 1-second exposure to 0.5% Triton X-100. After addition of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, the positive inotropic response to angiotensin I was completely abolished, both in the presence and the absence of an intact EE. Hence, the heart possesses angiotensin converting enzyme, which mediates the positive inotropic response to angiotensin I. An intact EE was not a prerequisite for this response; thus, myocytes as well as nonmyocytes may be possible locations (in addition to the EE) for angiotensin converting enzyme. In the presence of an intact EE, and after addition of captopril, the positive inotropic response to angiotensin II was significantly diminished (desensitization). By contrast, in the absence of an intact EE, but also after addition of captopril, the positive response to angiotensin II was potentiated (sensitization). Both desensitization and sensitization (in the presence or absence of an intact EE, respectively) of the response to angiotensin II induced by the addition of captopril were inhibited by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, suggesting a role for prostaglandins.", 
    "175": "Despite the risks associated with renovascular hypertension and the durable benefits of revascularization, the detection of patients with renovascular hypertension and the selection of those who will benefit from interventional therapy remains a challenge. We have previously documented the reliability of captopril renal scintigraphy in predicting angiographically significant renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension. In the present study we report our recent experience with this noninvasive technique in predicting outcome after revascularization. Captopril renal scintigraphy involves the administration of 50 mg of captopril 3 hours after a baseline technitium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scan and 1 hour before a repeat captopril renal scintigraphy scan. Nineteen of the last 70 patients with clinically suspected renovascular hypertension undergoing captopril renal scintigraphy had abnormal renal scan outcomes, and 17 had a decrease in flow or function after captopril (positive captopril renal scintigraphy). Eight of these 17 with abnormal findings on captopril renal scintigraphy underwent revascularization, and the hypertension was cured or improved in six of the eight: two of three after surgical bypass grafting and four of five after angioplasty. In the seven surviving patients with abnormal renal scan results but no change with captopril (negative captopril renal scintigraphy), improvement in hypertension after treatment occurred in only one: one of two after nephrectomy, zero of three after bypass surgery, and zero of two after angioplasty (p less than 0.05). We conclude that captopril renal scintigraphy is an accurate predictor of hypertension response to revascularization. Further evaluation of this new noninvasive technique for assessing patients with suspected renovascular hypertension appears warranted.",

Both routes of administration of captopril lead to lower blood pressure and decreased regional resistance, and to an increased arterial blood flow at rest. The first measurable effect and the peak effect on blood pressure and peripheral hemodynamics appear slightly earlier with sublingual administration. The data provided in this study support the usefulness of the sublingual route in clinical situations in which oral administration of captopril is not feasible.", 
    "177": "The effects of oral zofenopril pretreatment were investigated in a chronic closed-chest pig model of ischemia and reperfusion. Pigs (25-35 kg) were pretreated orally with zofenopril (15 mg/day) on the 2 days prior to ischemia, which was evoked by the inflation of a catheter balloon in the left anterior descending coronary artery over 45 minutes. The catheter was then removed and the myocardium was reperfused. After 2 weeks, infarct properties were assessed by signal averaging of the body surface electrocardiogram and the inducibility of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias was tested with a programmed electrical stimulation protocol. A significant increase in the pressure-rate product (43 +/- 11%, mean +/- SEM), indicating the oxygen demand of the heart, was prevented by zofenopril (19 +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). Zofenopril reduced the peak efflux of adrenaline (1302 +/- 213 vs. 3201 +/- 760 pg/ml; p less than 0.05), noradrenaline (402 +/- 54 vs. 902 +/- 282 pg/ml; p less than 0.05), and of the adenosine catabolites inosine and hypoxanthine (56 +/- 4 vs. 78 +/- 9, pg/ml; p less than 0.05) in the coronary venous effluent. The efflux of the cytoplasmatic enzyme creatine phosphokinase was not significantly reduced after zofenopril (p = 0.08). No difference in plasma renin levels between the groups were found.

    "178": "Thiazide diuretics may be more effective as antihypertensive agents in many subsets of patients than other medications, especially in reducing systolic blood pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers are less effective than calcium blockers or diuretics in black hypertensives and beta-blockers may be less effective in the elderly. Calcium blockers are equally effective in blacks, whites and the elderly but may not be as efficacious as diuretics. When used as initial monotherapy, most available antihypertensive drugs produce significant adverse subjective effects in about 8-10% of patients; centrally acting drugs, however, may produce annoying side effects in 20-30% of patients. Usually, some medication can be found that lowers blood pressure and is acceptable to the patient. Adverse metabolic effects are probably of limited long-term clinical significance except in a few patients. An approach to therapy that will prove effective in a majority of patients is outlined. Any one of the four classes of agents may appropriately be used as initial monotherapy (diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium blockers). Diuretics are recommended as the second drug of choice if one of the other agents is used first. With this approach approximately 80% or more of patients can be controlled at normotensive levels on one or at most two drugs.", 
    "179": "Considering the long-term effects of the commonly used antihypertensive agents, there appear to be no apparent adverse effects with calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The literature available concerning the effects of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers is extensive and rather confusing. In the case of thiazide diuretics, a review of the literature indicates that in the short-term (therapy for less than six months) thiazide diuretics induce a rise in total cholesterol, total triglycerides and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, with a possible fall in high density lipoprotein (HDL). If this was translated into long-term effects it could be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease. However, the long-term effects (therapy for more than six months) are unclear. Several large-scale trials of antihypertensive therapy using diuretics have suggested that the use of diuretics may have reduced the rate of decline of cholesterol levels which would otherwise have occurred. The literature on the effects of beta-blockers on blood lipids and lipoproteins is extensive and conflicting. The most consistent finding is a rise in triglycerides and there is some evidence that this may be due to the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. Some authors have found an associated fall in total HDL cholesterol. However, analysis of the effects on the main HDL subfractions (HDL2 and HDL3) show an increase in HDL2 and a decrease in HDL3, which may counteract the possibly detrimental reduction in total HDL. Since triglyceride levels have only weak relationship to atherosclerotic risk it seems unlikely that beta-blockers significantly increase this risk.", 
    "180": "It has been proposed that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) may play a part in the metabolism of substance P. Reduced metabolism following treatment with ACE inhibitors may cause accumulation of substance P to produce the adverse effect of cough. It has been shown in this study that, in contrast to angiotensin I and bradykinin, inhibition of local vascular ACE does not interfere with the vascular effects of substance P on forearm resistance vessels when this peptide is infused into the brachial artery of normal volunteers. These results suggest that endothelial ACE plays little part in the metabolism of intravascular substance P.", 
    "181": "The function of presynaptic angiotensin II receptors at postganglionic sympathetic terminal axons under conditions of uninterrupted sympathetic impulse traffic was studied in anesthetized rabbits (alfadolone + alfaxalone). Mean arterial pressure, postganglionic renal sympathetic firing rate, the arterial plasma noradrenaline concentration, and heart rate were measured before (basal values) and at the end of 4-min infusions of sodium nitroprusside. Angiotensin II (20 or 100 ng kg-1 min-1) caused dose-dependent increases of basal mean arterial pressure and decreases of basal sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate, but did not change the basal plasma noradrenaline concentration. Moreover, it shifted the sympathetic nerve activity-plasma noradrenaline relationship in a manner indicating an increase of the average release of noradrenaline per action potential. Angiotensin II at 100 ng kg-1 min-1 had an additional effect, at any given blood pressure, sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate were lower than in the controls. Captopril (1 mg kg-1 followed by 1 mg kg-1 h-1) caused no change in any parameter. The results demonstrate that exogenous angiotensin II activates release-facilitating receptors at postganglionic sympathetic neurons in rabbits with ongoing sympathetic nerve activity. Endogenous angiotensin II, however, played no role in cardiovascular regulation under the present, acute experimental conditions. Vasopressin, which was studied for comparison, lacked a presynaptic effect on the release of noradrenaline but caused sympathoinhibition by an action on a central component of the baroreflex.", 
    "182": "The effects of long-term cilazapril therapy on glucose tolerance and serum lipid profiles were investigated in 19 hypertensive patients: seven with normal glucose tolerance and 12 with glucose intolerance (including three patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes). Cilazapril was administered once daily for a mean duration of 6.4 months. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed before and during long-term therapy with cilazapril. Cilazapril produced satisfactory control of blood pressure in both patient groups during long-term therapy. It was well tolerated by all patients. Neither fasting nor postglucose-load venous plasma glucose levels were altered in either group of patients, and no patients with normal glucose tolerance developed diabetes mellitus during the study. There were no significant changes in the insulinogenic index (delta IRI/delta BS at 30 min postglucoseload) in patients with normal or impaired glucose tolerance. No significant changes in fasting levels of serum cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed in either group. These results suggest that effective long-term cilazapril therapy does not compromise glucose or lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients. Cilazapril may have a clinical advantage in that it can be given to hypertensive patients without concern that it might alter their serum lipid concentrations or impair glucose tolerance.", 
    "183": "Hypertension contributes to the inexorable decline of renal function in patients with chronic renal impairment. Studies on the long-term use of converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists in the treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure are hereby reviewed. The data demonstrate that converting enzyme inhibitors are effective antihypertensives in diabetic nephropathy and other forms of chronic renal failure. Furthermore, the results suggest that long-term treatment with captopril may slow the progression of renal impairment in diabetic nephropathy, whereas the data are inconclusive for non-diabetic nephropathies. A reduction of proteinuria or albuminuria was also observed in most trials during long-term converting enzyme inhibition. Treatment with calcium antagonists also led to effective blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with renal disease. However, the very limited data in humans suggest no consistent beneficial effect on kidney function or proteinuria. More controlled studies are necessary to determine the relative efficacy and safety of converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists in comparison with \"standard antihypertensives\" in long-term antihypertensive treatment of patients with various forms of chronic renal failure.", 
    "184": "Nephron loss is a common progression of a diverse range of kidney diseases. Recent experimental models of chronic renal disease have suggested that hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms play key roles in progressive renal injury. Extensive renal ablation in the rat was followed by development of altered glomerular hemodynamics. Albuminuria and histologic damage leading to focal glomerulosclerosis were preceded by the development of increased glomerular pressures and were prevented by interventions such as severe dietary protein restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Both experimental interventions ameliorated glomerular hypertension. It was therefore concluded that these interventions ameliorated injury by glomerular hemodynamic effect. Similar findings were obtained in a rat model of type I diabetes mellitus induced by streptozotocin in which glomerular hemodynamic factors appeared important to the development of progressive renal disease. Recent studies have suggested that nonhemodynamic factors have important roles in the progression of glomerular injury. For example, although the predominant effects of ACE inhibitor therapy appear to be hemodynamically mediated, data are emerging which suggest that these agents may also influence growth/proliferation of glomerular cells. Because hyperplasia/hypertrophy may influence glomerular susceptibility to injury, this may also be a potential mechanism whereby ACE inhibitor therapy influences glomerular damage. In addition, a variety of studies have suggested that hyperlipidemia, which is frequent accompaniment of glomerular disease, is an important modulator of glomerular injury independent of glomerular hemodynamic effects. Coagulation factors, calcium phosphorus balance, as well as the genetic susceptibility of the glomerulus to injury, all appear to contribute to progressive nephron destruction.", 
    "185": "Several experimental in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that structurally diverse converting enzyme inhibitors improve contractile dysfunction, as well as reduce arrhythmia production and acute mortality after occlusion of the coronary artery. Biochemical data have demonstrated that some inhibitors of converting enzyme bind better to cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) than others; however, there has not been any demonstrated correlation between inhibition of the enzyme and improvement in cardiac physiology in the acutely dysfunctioning stunned myocardium. It is assumed that ACE inhibitors reduce tissue generation of angiotensin II; however, this relationship as well as peptide levels in coronary venous effluent need to be specifically measured. The multiple substrates of ACE necessitate further work to explore the role of bradykinin and prostacyclin, which have been implicated by some workers as contributing to the beneficial action of ACE inhibitors. A new question is whether sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors are scavengers of toxic free radicals. Captopril, e.g., has been shown to be a free radical scavenger in superoxide-generating systems. Further work is required; however, as one report has recently shown, captopril does not directly scavenge superoxide but acts indirectly as an antioxidant or by altering the concentration of cytochrome c.", 
    "186": "The extent and severity of myocardial dysfunction and risk of dying are associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. However, there is a dissociation between the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and the prevalence of sudden death among patients with congestive heart failure. Sudden death occurs in 8 to 10% of New York Heart Association functional class I patients and in 20% of class II, III and IV patients, despite increased frequency of malignant arrhythmias and functional deterioration. Yearly mortality rates increase from 12 to 15% in class I and II and is 60% in class IV. Sudden death in class I and II is 50 to 60% of all deaths, whereas in class IV it amounts to only 20 to 30%. The most important cause of death in class IV is progressive congestive heart failure. Ventricular arrhythmia is a trigger event in the development of fatal arrhythmia which depends on a substrate of myocardial scar tissue, hypertrophy and aberrant conducting pathways. However, regional myocardial ischemia, transmembrane electrolyte differences and myocardial stores of catecholamines are important modulators. Depletion of myocardial catecholamines and down-regulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors in the myocardium may explain tolerance to ventricular tachyarrhythmias observed in patients with severe congestive heart failure and intolerance to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may reduce ventricular arrhythmias, the important role of ACE inhibitors in severe congestive heart failure is to prevent progression of myocardial dysfunction and congestive heart failure. To date, however, ACE inhibitors have not been demonstrated to have a significant effect on the incidence of sudden death. This does not preclude an effect on fatal arrhythmias among patients with milder heart failure and intact stores of myocardial catecholamines.", 
    "187": "The existence of independently functioning local renin-angiotensin systems in a number of tissues has been firmly established by biochemical and functional evidence and, most recently, by the demonstration of genetic messages for components of the renin-angiotensin systems, such as renin and angiotensinogen, in several organs. In this review, local renin-angiotensin systems in the heart and vascular walls are described and the contribution of a local inhibition of converting enzymes to the cardiovascular actions of converting enzyme inhibitors is discussed. Most of the studies cited support the hypothesis that an inhibition of cardiac converting enzyme may be involved in the beneficial hemodynamic and metabolic actions of converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and congestive heart failure, independent of the circulating renin-angiotensin system. Local effects on cardiac converting enzyme may contribute to the ability of converting enzyme inhibitors to reduce cardiac hypertrophy. Similarly, local converting enzyme inhibition in the vascular wall may not only constitute a mechanism involved in the antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme inhibitors, but may also contribute to the regression of hypertension-induced vascular hypertrophy. In addition to reduced local angiotensin II generation, converting enzyme inhibition may engender a potentiation of the local effects of kinins. This mechanism may be more important to the cardiovascular actions of converting enzyme inhibitors than initially thought.", 
    "188": "The ability of captopril and enalaprilat, 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, to scavenge superoxide anion radical was examined. With use of a number of superoxide-generating systems, such as xanthine-xanthine oxidase, phorbol myristate acetate-activated neutrophils, auto-oxidizing dihydroxyfumarate, and auto-oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome, captopril was seen not to scavenge superoxide directly, because it did not inhibit superoxide-dependent cytochrome c or nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction. Superoxide-dependent cytochrome c reduction was inhibited only when captopril was preincubated with a lower concentration of cytochrome c (22 microM). This effect was due to a decrease in the concentration of cytochrome c, because captopril reduced cytochrome c directly. When this effect was compensated for, no cytochrome c reduction induced by superoxide was observed. Captopril inhibited the auto-oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome at pH 10.2 where this auto-oxidation is superoxide-dependent, and at pH 7.8 where it is superoxide-independent and superoxide dismutase insensitive. It appears that captopril, in this respect, acted as a nonspecific antioxidant, probably by reducing an intermediate in the complex oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome. Therefore, caution may be used in interpreting the role of captopril in the attenuation of reperfusion-induced myocardial dysfunction and in attributing this effect to the inhibition of free radical mechanism.", 
    "189": "Recent research indicates that neurohormonal responses after myocardial infarction may predict patient outcome, and alteration of this process may change etiologic factors and strengthen positive prognosticators. Because there are clinical similarities between acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, there appears to be justification for a unified treatment approach (i.e., therapies that have proved beneficial in the treatment of myocardial infarction have also showed promise in the treatment of heart failure). Conversely, some therapies that have benefited the patient with heart failure may benefit the patient who has had a myocardial infarction. For example, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been proven to blunt detrimental neurohormonal activity seen after myocardial infarction. These therapies promise to reduce complications and improve survival.", 
    "190": "In our present studies, we evaluated the role of the submandibular glands (SMG) on plasma inactive renin (PIR) releasing mechanisms in rats using some agents which are known to stimulate plasma active renin (PAR) release. The results were analyzed between sialoadenectomized (SX) and sham-operated (control: C) rats. Twenty-four h after the operation, PAR releasing agents, furosemide (FRO) 2.5 mg/rat/h with prior iv bolus 5 mg, captopril (CAP) 5 mg/rat/h with prior iv bolus 10 mg, 1-Sar-8-Ile-angiotensin II (Ang II A) 300 ng/kg/min, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) 100 ng/kg/min, and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) 100 ng/kg/min, were infused through femoral venous cannulae. Blood samples were taken through femoral arterial cannulae into test tubes containing 2 mg EDTA-2Na. PAR was assayed by RIA, and total renin was obtained after tryptic activation. According to the responses of PIR, the agents used were categorized into three patterns: FRO increased PIR, both PGs lowered PIR, and, CAP and Ang II A had no effect on PIR release. The PIR release mechanisms by FRO were further investigated by 20 mg FRO ip injection in totally nephrectomized rats. PIR increased even in nephrectomized rats, but the increase was totally canceled by the following SX. In conclusion, FRO alone among some agents studied is able to stimulate PIR release only under the existence of SMG.", 
    "191": "In a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial 22 healthy normotensive young men (mean age 25 +/- 1.7 years) were given a single oral dose of 50 mg captopril or a placebo (11 subjects each). To test their concentration and proficiency, as well as spatial perception and reaction capacity four tests were administered: attention, concentration, hose-pattern perception and \"Bonn Determination Device\". Captopril had no negative effects on any test performances either one or five hours after its administration, or after a single daily dose for seven days. There was only a small, statistically not significant, difference in the effect on blood pressure between captopril and the placebo.", 
    "192": "High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the purity and impurities of fosinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used to treat hypertension. Purity values are determined using a silica column and usually are above 99%. All known possible impurities, including stereoisomeric impurities, can be resolved and quantified by injecting solutions of fosinopril onto three separate columns; silica, strong anion exchange and phenyl. Typical impurity contents total 0.5%. Validation data and a study of properties of fosinopril in solution is included.", 
    "193": "Although acute afterload reduction is known to improve cardiac output in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), the effect of therapy on the atrial overload directly causing congestive symptoms has not been systematically studied. Atrial volumes and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, in addition to left ventricular ejection fraction and indexes of left ventricular contractility (mean acceleration, ejection time and peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume index), were measured using 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography and color flow imaging in 30 patients with advanced CHF, before and after acute vasodilator and diuretic therapy tailored to hemodynamic goals. Therapy increased stroke volume by 64% (36 +/- 10 to 55 +/- 14 cc), decreased right atrial pressure by 45% (15 +/- 5 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg), systemic vascular resistance by 36% (1,700 +/- 400 to 1,030 +/- 300 dynes s cm-5) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 37% (31 +/- 6 to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg) (all p less than 0.001). Echocardiography showed simultaneous reductions in left and right atrial volumes: 24 +/- 19 and 18 +/- 12%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation measured by color flow fraction both decreased by a mean of 44% (p less than 0.001). While ejection fraction increased from 15 +/- 5 to 19 +/- 7% (p less than 0.001), there were no changes in relatively load-independent indexes of contractility. Therefore, acute therapy with vasodilators and diuretics in advanced CHF causes reductions in atrial volumes and atrioventricular valve regurgitation that are evident from serial noninvasive studies and may play a major role in the improvement of congestive symptoms.", 
    "194": "Diuretics are still among the most frequently used antihypertensive drugs in the treatment of hypertension. Their pharmacologic and hemodynamic properties are based on the water and salt metabolism in the pathophysiology of high blood pressure. Initially, there is a reduction of plasma and extracellular fluid volume; cardiac output also decreases. After this early phase, cardiac output returns to normal with an accompanying decrease in peripheral resistance so as to correct the underlying hemodynamic fault of the hypertensive state. Diuretics have a high therapeutic efficacy either as monotherapy or in combination with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists. The main problem with the use of diuretics is related to their metabolic side effects, which are dose-related. Currently, there is a tendency to administer low-dose diuretics, which result in fewer clinical and metabolic side effects, but with a continued antihypertensive efficacy. Therefore, low doses of diuretics can be recommended as initial therapy in the stepped-care approach of hypertension.", 
    "195": "A multicenter study was performed to assess the efficacy and the acceptability of indapamide in hypertensive patients previously untreated, or treated and unsatisfactorily controlled with either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or beta-blocking therapy. Four centers participated in the study, which included patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was between 95 and 115 mmHg with no treatment (group I, n = 40), those taking captopril (group II, n = 40) or those taking propranolol (group III, n = 40). After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients received indapamide either alone (group I) or in combination with the previous therapy (groups II and III) for 4 months. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and clinical and biochemical acceptability were measured before and after 2 and 4 months of treatment. At the same time points, quality of life was determined using standardized questionnaires completed by the patient (20 items) and the physician (10 items) and a visual analog scale completed by the patient. In all groups, administration of indapamide induced a clinically and statistically significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the supine position after 2 months. Indapamide alone controlled blood pressure in 82% of the patients previously untreated, and indapamide in combined therapy controlled blood pressure, respectively, in 67 and 85% of patients previously uncontrolled with ACE inhibitors or beta blockers. In all groups, questionnaires on quality of life showed a progressive and significant improvement in general well-being. After 4 months of treatment, the percentage of improvement in the physician questionnaire was 77.1% in group I, 60.6% in group II and 71.4% in group III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "196": "Hypertensive patients are at an increased risk of developing cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Treatment has resulted in a substantial reduction in cerebrovascular deaths but not in cardiovascular mortality. As the number of deaths from myocardial infarction exceeds the sum of all other hypertension-related mortalities, these results are disappointing. The hypothesis that metabolic side effects of many antihypertensive drugs offset the potential benefit of decreasing blood pressure is of particular interest. In established hypertension there is an increase in total peripheral resistance. Long-term therapy with diuretics decreases vascular resistance. This is also evident with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha blockers. In patients with hypertension, an increased wall to lumen ratio occurs in resistance vessels where mechanisms such as smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased amounts of elastin and collagen are present. In small resistance vessels, long-term antihypertensive therapy has a positive effect, but the effect in large arteries is variable.", 
    "197": "The efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications has been clearly demonstrated in the last 20 years. Antihypertensives are particularly useful in the reduction of cerebrovascular complications which decrease by 60% on average in clinical trials on the treatment of mild and severe hypertension. After the first clinical trials, the 1978 World Health Organization Experts Committee recommended the classic stepped-care (SC) approach with diuretics and beta blockers as first-step agents. Other antihypertensive drugs, such as reserpine, centrally acting agents and vasodilators could be used in the next steps if blood pressure control was not achieved. Both diuretics and beta blockers have been widely used and the SC regimen has contributed to the better control of arterial hypertension in the community. The SC regimen has given general practitioners easy guidelines with which to treat hypertensive patients. There are many reasons for modifying the classic SC approach. Prescription of antihypertensive drugs at high doses should be avoided and the use of new agents, such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, is recommended. Demographic trends have brought about an increase in the aged population and, consequently, an increase in the proportion of elderly hypertensives. These patients present particular problems in long-term management, among which are a high frequency of other associated diseases and an important number of adverse effects caused by the classic antihypertensive drugs. Nevertheless, diuretics are still useful in the treatment of hypertension, either as a monotherapy regimen or in association with other drugs. New diuretics, such as indapamide, have a very interesting pharmacologic profile with considerably fewer metabolic side effects on plasma cholesterol and glucose levels.", 
    "198": "Captopril, which is a thiol containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has a close structural similarity to D-penicillamine, behaves as a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In order to ascertain whether the DMARD-like properties of captopril reside in its ability to inhibit ACE or in the thiol group, we evaluated pentopril (CGS-13945) in patients with active RA. This recently synthesized drug is a nonthiol containing ACE inhibitor. Pentopril produced little clinical improvement and no biochemical improvement in a group of 15 patients with RA, many of whom were unable to tolerate it because of in-effect or side effects. A reduction in serum ACE activity and a modest fall in blood pressure suggested that the drug was exerting its pharmacological effect. Our study strengthens the argument that the therapeutic benefit of captopril in RA probably lies in its thiol group rather than in its enzyme inhibition properties, and that the thiol group may be the effective moiety in some other DMARD.", 
    "199": "The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that angiotensin II (ANG II) mediates nonosmotic thirst in animals fed the low-NaCl K-free diet by preventing the increased generation of ANG II using the converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. Animals were fed either a control salt or low-NaCl K-free diet and were treated with or without enalapril. Water intake in rats fed the low-NaCl K-free diet increased more than twofold on day 3 and remained elevated over the 10-day period of study. Treatment with enalapril (40 mg.kg-1.day-1) 1) prevented the striking rise in plasma renin activity in rats fed the low-NaCl K-free diet, 2) led to complete blockade of the pressor response to a 50-ng injection of angiotensin I but not ANG II, 3) did not affect daily water intake in rats consuming the control salt diet, 4) did not reduce basal water intake in rats fed the low-NaCl K-free diet below values measured in control animals, and 5) did not abolish water intake in response to osmotic stimulation. However, enalapril treatment abolished the increase in water intake that occurs in animals fed the low-NaCl K-free diet. In a double crossover study using two groups of rats fed the low-NaCl K-free diet, enalapril prevented increased water intake in rats initially fed the low-NaCl K-free diet and rapidly inhibited increased water intake in rats fed the low-NaCl K-free diet after the high water intake had been established.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In general, the addition of lipophilic substituents to the 4-position of proline of the parent phosphonate 1 resulted in substantial increases in in vitro activity. The largest improvements were observed in the case of cis-benzyl (36-fold) and dithioketal (24-fold) analogues 2r and 2x, respectively. These enhancements of in vitro activity were accompanied by modest increases (2-3.5-fold) in in vivo (iv) activity. Among the various terminal amino acid replacements examined in this study, the indoline-based analogue 2i was by far the most potent compound on iv administration in the normotensive rat.", 
    "201": "Analysis of examination and treatment of 104 patients who were periodically exposed to hemodialysis and 60 persons who sustained the allotransplantation of a cadaveric kidney enabled the authors to reveal the incidence of arterial hypertension before and after the transplantation. Pronounced arterial hypertension (AH) was documented in patients who were treated with hemodialysis sessions for the proper renal diseases developed in angionephrosclerosis (chronic glomerulo- and pyelonephritis). In those who sustained the transplantation, AH was pronounced in case of acute of chronic rejection, transplanted artery stenosis of renal renin hyperproduction. Higher incidence of AH (2.3-fold higher) was observed in posttransplantation patients with the native kidney left. It correlated with higher peripheral plasma renin activity (RRA). The authors suggested that the scheme should be used for the diagnosis of AH manifestation both before and after the transplantation which included the account for the cause of the disease terminal stage, the character of the AH variance in hemodialysis captopril testing, radiocardiographic examination, indirect renal angiography (99-Tc pertechnetate) or selective blood testing for RPA in case bilateral nephrectomy should be made in two stages. For the patients who had sustained the transplantation of the kidney, the diagnostic scheme should include a double pulse Doppler sonography, arteriographic investigation of the transplant and pharmacorenography with a captopril load test. Advisability of captopril stimulation of renin secretion during the selective sampling of the blood was demonstrated. The authors verified the time-course of renin activity, the concentration of aldosterone, cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone in patients with a history of bilateral nephrectomy, defined the indications for bilateral nephrectomy associated with AH and discussed its possible outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

[Sar1-Leu8]Angiotensin II attenuated metabolic responses to intravenous angiotensin in all subfornical organ subregions. Brattleboro rats, having high circulating levels of angiotensin, displayed greater rates of glucose metabolism than Long-Evans rats in all subregions, differences that were eliminated by captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. The studies reveal focal subfornical organ zones where in vivo metabolic activity corresponds to cytoarchitectonic evidence for topographical processing within this angiotensin-sensitive structure.", 
    "203": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril on the severity of radiation-induced epilation and moist desquamation and the incidence of skin tumours was determined for up to 52 weeks in male rats. The irradiation consisted of a range of single doses (0, 10, 20, 30 Gy) of 60Co gamma rays to a 3.5 cm2 right hemithorax port. Half of each radiation dose group consumed control powdered chow, and half consumed chow containing Captopril (50 mg/kg/day) continuously after irradiation. There were time- and radiation-dose-dependent increases in all three skin reactions. Rats exposed to 10 Gy exhibited a mild and transient epilation, but no moist desquamation or neoplasia in the radiation port. In animals exposed to 30 Gy, however, epilation began at 2 weeks after irradiation, reached a peak at approximately 7 weeks, then persisted essentially unchanged through 52 weeks. Captopril had no significant effect on the epilation reaction. Two waves of moist desquamation were observed after 30 Gy. The first appeared at 3 weeks after irradiation, reached a peak from 6-10 weeks, then subsided partially but significantly from 12-26 weeks. The second wave of moist desquamation began at 26-28 weeks, often was ulcerative, and occasionally was accompanied by the appearance of tumours in the irradiated volume. Captopril significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the severity of both phases of the moist desquamation reaction after 30 Gy, and reduced the percentage of animals exhibiting the most severe desquamation score (involving 50% of the radiation port). Of particular interest was the observation that Captopril also reduced the incidence of tumours. Of the 14 tumours detected, all were malignant (fibrosarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas), and only three (p less than 0.05) occurred in rats receiving Captopril. Multiple tumours (three cases), tumours induced by 20 Gy (three cases), and tumours appearing before 6 months (one case) were observed only in rats consuming control diet, never in Captopril-treated animals. Animals which developed tumours in the second 6 months post-irradiation exhibited significantly more severe moist desquamation during the first 6 months than did the tumour-free members of their treatment group. Thus Captopril, known to ameliorate acute lung damage in irradiated rats, also reduces chronic benign and malignant skin reactions in the radiation treatment field.",

Captopril (0.5-1.0 mg/kg orally) did not affect Iodine-123 Hippuran nephrography in two children with mild renal artery stenosis, but induced an accumulation of the tracer within the kidneys in two children with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. As in adults Iodine 123 Hippuran nephrography appears to be a useful tool to identify patients with significant renal artery stenosis.", 
    "205": "A 41-year-old woman visited our hospital with chief complaint of hypertension which was refractory to multiple antihypertensive drugs. Her blood pressure was 200/140 mmHg and her plasma renin activity was as high as 3.1 ng/ml/hr. Angiography revealed bilateral renal artery stenosis. To determine the laterality of the kidney which were responsible for her hypertension, the 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy with captopril was performed. The estimated GFR of the right kidney was lowered than that of the control, while there was no change in the left kidney. Subsequently Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) was performed to the right kidney. Postoperatively blood pressure remained elevated as well as serum renin level. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy with captopril was repeated and revealed no decrease in the GFR of the right kidney this time, but significant reduction in the GFR of the left kidney. After the second PTA to the left kidney, her blood pressure was finally normalized. Postoperatively GFR of both kidneys was not affected by captopril on renal scintigraphy, and currently she has remained normotensive without medication. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy with captopril appears to be a useful method to diagnose the laterality and to evaluate in clinical response to therapeutic intervention.", 
    "206": "1. We have studied the effect of epithelium removal on relaxation of guinea-pig isolated tracheal smooth muscle induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or stimulation of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nerves. Also examined were the effects of inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). 2. Epithelium removal produced a 3.6 +/- 0.4 fold leftward shift in the VIP concentration-response curve. The supersensitivity to VIP, following epithelium removal was abolished by phosphoramidon or thiorphan (NEP inhibitors), but unaffected by captopril (an ACE inhibitor). In intact trachea, the NEP inhibitors produced leftward shifts in the VIP curves similar to those produced by epithelium removal. 3. In contrast to responses to exogenous VIP, neurogenic NANC inhibitory responses to electrical field stimulation were affected neither by epithelial denudation nor by the peptidase inhibitors. 4. As in previous studies, epithelium removal increased tracheal sensitivity to isoprenaline. This was not altered by pretreatment with a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors. Thus, the effect of the NEP inhibitors on responses to VIP appears to be relatively specific. 5. These data indicate that exogenous VIP is a substrate for airway NEP, since inhibition of the enzyme potentiates the peptide. This is further evidence that the airway epithelium provides a source for the metabolism of mediators. 6. In guinea-pig trachea the NEP responsible for cleaving VIP may be located largely in the epithelial layer, since NEP inhibition was without effect on sensitivity to VIP in epithelium-denuded preparations. If VIP is a NANC inhibitory neurotransmitter in this tissue its degradation endogenously does not appear to involve epithelial NEP.", 
    "207": "Despite the successful therapeutic applications of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to date, knowledge of how they work and guidelines for their use are still incomplete. On their role as monotherapy in congestive heart failure, we have scarce and conflicting data. Nor is there a clear answer to the question, when should an ACE inhibitor be started in a patient with heart failure? In patients with severe heart failure, the addition of an ACE inhibitor to a diuretic regimen has been shown to improve prognosis. In patients with mild heart failure, a benefit has not been demonstrated. In one preliminary report, monotherapy with the ACE inhibitor quinapril was shown to improve exercise time and functional class in patients with mild heart failure compared to placebo.", 
    "208": "Hypertension is a major potential problem among the increasing number of older persons in the population, threatening their health and shortening their life expectancy due particularly to stroke and congestive heart failure (CHF). Controlled studies have shown that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces the incidence of severe CHF, stroke and cardiovascular mortality in the elderly. Special consideration should be given to altered drug metabolism, altered responses to drugs, and concomitant medications when pharmacotherapy is instituted in the elderly. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are acceptable in the hypertensive older patient as first-line therapy for all grades of hypertension and as second-line therapy for the patient with CHF. Use of ACE inhibitors avoids many of the symptoms and metabolic disturbances associated with beta-blockers and diuretics. Quinapril is a new non-sulphydryl ACE inhibitor whose active metabolite, quinaprilat, has a relatively short accumulation half-life compared with enalapril and lisinopril but has an enhanced affinity for the converting enzyme, allowing rapid excretion of the drug while retaining a 24-hour antihypertensive effect with once-daily dosing. Quinapril is a valuable addition to the ACE inhibitor class, with demonstrated efficacy and safety in the older patient.", 
    "209": "This paper reviews the haemodynamic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertension, focusing on their ability to cause a fall in systemic vascular resistance, with no change in cardiac output and no reduction and even an increase in blood flow to vital organs such as the brain, the kidney and the heart. The haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors are qualitatively similar in congestive heart failure, except that, in the presence of impaired cardiac function, the fall in resistance is accompanied by a pronounced increase in cardiac output and tissue perfusion. In both conditions ACE inhibition opposes sympathetic influences and enhances vagal influences and, in hypertension, this intervention is followed by a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy providing a multifold background for a cardioprotective action. The new ACE inhibitor quinapril appears to share the haemodynamic effects of other ACE inhibitors with an improvement of cardiovascular function in congestive heart failure.", 
    "210": "The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma prolactin, and renin activity were examined in a single-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 30 patients with essential hypertension (15 given drug, 15 placebo). Captopril, 25 mg administered orally, reduced the blood pressure and increased the plasma renin activity. Captopril decreased mean plasma prolactin from 17.5 +/- 1.4 ng/mL to 9.1 +/- 1.0 ng/mL (p less than 0.001). Significant correlation was found between captopril-induced change from control values of plasma prolactin (delta plasma prolactin) vs delta plasma renin activity (r = -0.688, p less than 0.001). These results suggest that acute administration of captopril was accompanied by a reduction in plasma prolactin and that this reduction may be of clinical significance during therapy of hypertension.", 
    "211": "1. We investigated the mechanism of tetradecapeptide-induced vasoconstriction by studying the metabolism of tetradecapeptide (TDP), angiotensinogen, and angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) by isolated perfused rat hindlimbs. 2. Using HPLC and specific RIAs we have quantified six angiotensin peptides: pentapeptide(4-8), hexapeptide(3-8), heptapeptide(2-8), octapeptide(1-8), nonapeptide(2-10) and decapeptide(1-10) in hindlimb effluent. 3. TDP-induced vasoconstriction was associated with generation of predominantly AI and AII, with smaller amounts of the other peptides measured. 4. Captopril prevented vasoconstriction and inhibited AII production by 80%, indicating a dominant role for AI generation in the vascular response to TDP. 5. Evidence that renin is not the enzyme responsible for AI generation from TDP includes: first, the failure of angiotensinogen to cause vasoconstriction or angiotensin peptide generation despite very high amounts of AI and AII generation from TDP; second, the resistance of the TDP-induced vasoconstriction and angiotensin peptide generation to inhibition by pepstatin; and third, the failure of bilateral nephrectomy 24 h before the experiment to influence the vascular and angiotensin peptide response to TDP. 6. AII was cleared with 41% efficiency, with generation of penta-, hexa-, and heptapeptides. 7. AI was cleared with 59% efficiency; this was reduced to 24% by captopril, indicating a conversion of at least 35% of AI to AII by ACE. 8. These studies have identified vascular metabolism of AI and AII to be an efficient process, with both ACE and aminopeptidases playing an important role, and indicate that those peptidases which cleave TDP to generate AI are unlikely to play any role in AI generation in vivo.", 
    "212": "Mitral regurgitation was created surgically in 10 dogs. After measurement of baseline hemodynamic parameters on day 2, treatment with captopril (2 mg/kg orally 3 times daily) was begun in five dogs. Five control dogs received no therapy during the study. The hemodynamic parameters were measured again at weeks 6 and 22. In the treated dogs, the forward ejection fraction (FEF) increased slightly and the total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) decreased. In the controls, the FEF decreased and the TPRI increased. Changes in FEF and TPRI were significantly different between the two groups. The change in FEF correlated significantly with the change in TPRI in both groups. Although the most dramatic changes were observed at week 6, the differences persisted throughout the study. Captopril administration resulted in sustained hemodynamic improvement and may, therefore, delay the onset of congestive heart failure in dogs with mitral regurgitation.",

Clearly lack of insulin, with its associated disorders of carbohydrate, protein, and/or lipid metabolism, initiates the process which eventually leads to the characteristic histologic picture of diabetic nephropathy. The disturbance in cellular metabolism per se could directly injure the kidney by altering the energy needs of the cell or by leading to the accumulation of cellular toxins (ie, polyols) or by causing the deficiency of key cellular metabolites (ie, myoinositol). Elevation of the plasma glucose concentration enhances the glycosylation of proteins, which in turn can lead to glomerular basement membrane thickening, loss of charge selectivity, and direct cellular damage. The multiple disturbances in intermediary metabolism are associated with increased levels of and/or enhanced sensitivity to a variety of growth factors, including IGF-I and angiotensin, and this could lead to glomerular hypertrophy. An increase in the filtered load and subsequent reabsorption of electrolytes and metabolites also could contribute to renal hypertrophy. In all animal models of nephropathy, including diabetes, glomerular hypertrophy has been shown to be the best correlate of glomerular sclerosis, proteinuria, and progressive renal deterioration. The potential mechanisms by which glomerular hypertrophy can lead to renal histologic damage were discussed previously. By increasing the luminal diameter, glomerular hypertrophy also would be expected to augment wall tension and thereby increase intraglomerular pressure. Derangements in cellular metabolism or altered sensitivity to angiotensin also can directly elevate the intraglomerular pressure and lead to structural renal damage. In this schema, elevated intraglomerular pressure is but one of many pathogenic factors that contribute to the development of diabetic glomerulopathy and albuminuria. The precise role of increased glomerular pressure in the evolution of diabetic nephropathy remains uncertain at present. In rats, severe diabetic nephropathy can occur without an increase in Pgc, while in humans, hyperfiltration does not appear to be a predictor of proteinuria and renal dysfunction. Lastly, it is likely that a variety of other factors, including the coagulation system, plasma/cell lipid levels, prostaglandins, etc, also play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. According to the outline presented in Figure 1, it is unlikely that any single factor will be sufficient to explain the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Ultimately, the origin of diabetic nephropathy in IDDM must be traced to insulin lack, with its associated derangements in cellular metabolism. Therefore, the importance of tight glucose control should not be underemphasized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "214": "Systemic and peripheral hemodynamic response to isometric exercise by handgrip test at 30% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for 3 minutes was assessed in 16 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after short-term treatment with either captopril or placebo given according to a double-blind, randomized, cross-over sequence. During placebo, isometric exercise increased blood pressure (BP) and total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR) and decreased cardiac index (CI). Captopril reduced the pressor response to exercise (mean +/- SD) (% systolic: from 14.7 +/- 6 to 11.7 +/- 3; p less than .05/% diastolic: from 12.4 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 3; p less than .005) and increased CI (from 2.3 +/- .6 to 2.6 +/- .9 liters/min/m2; p less than .01) whereas TPVR remained virtually unchanged (from 1479 +/- 597 to 1594 +/- 692 U; NS). The changes in mean BP after exercise were inversely related to the early increase in forearm blood flow (FBF) in exercising forearm during both placebo (r = .67) and captopril (r = .71). The extent of reduction in mean BP response after captopril was inversely related to the extra increase in exercising FBF determined by the drug when compared to placebo (r = .73). We conclude that captopril is able to improve the hemodynamic response to static exercise in patients with CHF, probably by increasing the blood supply to exercising muscles during contraction, thus blunting the extent of reflex pressor response.", 
    "215": "Diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors currently are the mainstay of both acute and chronic heart failure management. They have earned their place by bringing measurable and reliable clinical benefit to patients with all grades and types of heart failure. Other treatments--digoxin, vasodilators and inotropes--offer less secure efficacy and their clinical role is at times controversial. The need for new remedies is inescapable. Despite current therapy, heart failure causes a distressing reduction in both quality and quantity of life. As knowledge of the pathophysiology of heart failure is gained, more selective treatment options may become available offering hitherto unknown specificity but demanding remarkable levels of diagnostic accuracy.", 
    "216": "This study evaluated the blood pressure effects of administration of once daily oral benazepril hydrochloride, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, for mild-to-moderate hypertension. After a 2 to 4 week placebo baseline period, patients with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg, were randomized to receive either placebo or benazepril hydrochloride, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg, once daily in double-blind fashion for 28 days. Blood pressure was measured predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the dose during inpatient observation days at the end of the placebo baseline period, and on the first and last day of the double-blind treatment period; and 24 hours after the dose at weekly outpatient visits. All doses of benazepril hydrochloride resulted in clinically important reductions in diastolic and systolic blood pressures that lasted between 12 and 24 hours after both the first dose, and following the last dose after 4 weeks of treatment. The findings indicate that benazepril hydrochloride may be clinically useful as once-daily monotherapy in many patients with hypertension.", 
    "217": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and dosages of the three currently available angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed. This class of agents effectively inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, a hormone that also promotes, via aldosterone stimulation, increased sodium and water retention. The ACE inhibitors, therefore, are capable of lowering blood pressure primarily by promoting vasodilatation and reducing intravascular fluid volume. Captopril, the first orally active, commercially available ACE inhibitor, is a sulfhydryl-containing compound. Captopril was followed by the introduction of enalapril and lisinopril, two non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitors. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these three ACE inhibitors differ. Captopril has rapid onset with relatively short duration of action, whereas enalapril and lisinopril have slower onset and relatively long duration of action. Captopril is an active ACE inhibitor in its orally absorbable parent form. In contrast, enalapril must be deesterified in the liver to the metabolite enalaprilat in order to inhibit the converting enzyme; this accounts for its delayed onset of action. Lisinopril does not require metabolic activation to be effective; however, a slow and incomplete absorption pattern explains the delay in onset of activity. Captopril and its disulfide metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine with minor elimination in the feces. Approximately two-thirds of an administered enalapril dose is excreted in the urine as both the parent drug and the metabolite enalaprilat; the remainder of these two substances are excreted in the feces. Lisinopril does not undergo measurable metabolism and approximately one-third is excreted unchanged in the urine with the remaining parent drug being excreted in the feces. The ACE inhibitors lower systemic vascular resistance with a resultant decrease in blood pressure. Their efficacy is comparable to diuretics and beta-blockers in treating patients with mild, moderate, or severe essential and renovascular hypertension. In those patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) the ACE inhibitors produce a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure. These drugs may produce improvement in cardiac output and stroke volume and, with chronic administration, may promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The antihypertensive effects of the ACE inhibitors are enhanced when these agents are combined with a diuretic. Captopril and enalapril have been shown to be of particular benefits as adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure, both in terms of subjective improvement of patient symptoms, and in improving overall hemodynamic status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "218": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on renal hemodynamics vary widely depending on the preexisting physiologic and pathologic state of the kidneys. Although some studies of ACE inhibitors in primary essential hypertension have demonstrated increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow in patients with renal impairment, other studies have not shown these same beneficial results. The difference may involve the choice of ACE inhibitor used in the investigations, but controlled comparison trials are needed to determine whether this is the case. The use of ACE inhibitors in renovascular hypertension remains controversial. ACE inhibition can interfere with the autoregulation of GFR mediated by angiotensin II and may lead to deterioration of renal function, especially in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of a solitary kidney. Additionally, ACE inhibitors have been shown to cause a decline in GFR in the kidney affected by the stenosis, whether or not clinically apparent renal insufficiency occurs. Although the functional impairment associated with ACE inhibitors in renal artery stenosis has generally been reversible following removal of the drug, the consequences of a long-term reduction in GFR are unknown. Treatment of stable congestive heart failure (CHF) with ACE inhibitors can result in enhancement of GFR and reduction of sodium and fluid retention, thus improving the clinical state. However, in patients with decompensated cardiac failure, renal perfusion pressures may already be at or near the autoregulatory breakpoint and ACE inhibition may cause deterioration of renal function. In general, ACE inhibitors can be used safely in CHF if they are initiated cautiously, with adjustment of ACE inhibitor and diuretic dosages to avoid systemic hypotension and sodium and fluid depletion. In studies comparing the agents, enalapril and lisinopril have both been shown to cause higher incidences of renal function deterioration than has captopril. These findings suggest that the more complete or sustained ACE inhibition seen with the longer-acting agents may be detrimental to renal function in patients with CHF. The use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of proteinuria is the newest area of research with these agents. At present it appears that ACE inhibitors reduce urinary protein excretion the most effectively in diabetic patients with mild proteinuria and in hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency and proteinuria due to glomerular disorders. More study is needed to determine whether these agents can reduce the rate of renal failure progression and to define the patient populations expected to benefit most.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "219": "Several clinical investigations have suggested that captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), currently used as an antihypertensive agent, exhibited anti-depressant properties in humans. The present experiment was evaluated for potential antidepressive activity of captopril on the learned helplessness paradigm in rats. Captopril (8, 16, 32 mg/kg/day, IP) induced a reversal of escape deficits but did not affect significantly the motor activity, suggesting that this effect was not due to motor stimulation. This antidepressant-like activity was comparable to that of imipramine (16, 32 mg/kg/day, IP). Naloxone (0.5; 1 mg/kg, IP) blocked the effect of captopril (16 mg/kg, IP) in this test. These results suggest that an opioid mediation could be responsible at least in part for its behavioral effect.", 
    "220": "To understand better the mechanism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema, we studied the effects of ACE-inhibitor treatment on wheal-and-flare responses to histamine, codeine, and bradykinin in 10 normal subjects. No change in the size of wheal-and-flare reactions to histamine occurred, but the size of wheal reactions to codeine and bradykinin increased in all study subjects after ingesting the ACE inhibitor, captopril. Five of 10 study subjects developed flushing reactions after ACE-inhibitor treatment. We conclude that inhibition of bradykinin metabolism by ACE inhibitors is the probable cause of ACE inhibitor-related angioedema and that substance P is not the predominant mediator in this process.", 
    "221": "In conscious 18-21-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, DuP 753, a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, given orally at 3 and 10 mg/kg or intravenously at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, reduced blood pressure dose dependently. It did not alter heart rate at these doses. At 10 mg/kg i.v., DuP 753 decreased blood pressure significantly for at least 24 hours, suggesting a long duration of the antihypertensive effect. Unlike saralasin, DuP 753 did not cause a transient increase in blood pressure. The acute antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 was greater than that of captopril. Our data indicate that, for captopril to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent as that of DuP 753, it would need to be supplemented by a diuretic. DuP 753 did not have an acute diuretic effect. Bilateral nephrectomy, but not inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, abolished the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753, suggesting that the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 is dependent on an active renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, DuP 753 inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin II but not the responses to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and Bay K 8644 (a calcium agonist). As neither DuP 753 nor captopril decreased blood pressure acutely in Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats, our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the control of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.",

AB-47 was slightly more potent than enalaprilat in inhibiting rabbit lung ACE. The ACE inhibition and bradykinin (BK) potentiation by AB-47 in guinea-pig ileal longitudinal muscle were as potent as with enalaprilat. In conscious rat, AB-47 (i.v.) inhibited angiotensin I (A-I)-induced pressor response and augmented BK-induced depressor response more potently and in a long-lasting manner than enalaprilat. Furthermore, AB-47 exhibited higher selectivity for ACE inhibition than for BK inactivation and higher selectivity than enalaprilat and captopril. The inhibition of A-I-induced pressor response by AB-47 (p.o.) was as potent as that of enalapril. These results suggest that AB-47 is a highly potent, long-lasting and relatively A-I-selective ACE inhibitor.", 
    "223": "1. The route of elimination of FPL 63547, a novel inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), has been investigated in the anaesthetized rat. Comparisons have been made with other ACE inhibitors. 2. Bile and urine samples were collected over a 5 hour period following a single i.v. dose of ACE inhibitor (2 mumol kg-1). Samples were bioassayed for ACE inhibitory activity using affinity-purified rabbit lung ACE and the amounts of the active form of inhibitor present in each sample were calculated by comparison with a standard curve. 3. FPL 63547 was rapidly and extensively excreted as the diacid in the bile but appeared in the urine in negligible amounts. The bile:urine ratio was 21.4:1 indicating a marked preference for the biliary route. A similar elimination profile was observed when the compound was dosed in its active form (FPL 63547 diacid), 87.9% of which was found in the bile over the 5 h collection period, with a bile: urine ratio of 14.6:1. 4. The marked preference of FPL 63547 for biliary elimination was not shared by the other ACE inhibitors tested in this study. Lisinopril demonstrated the opposite pattern, being excreted almost exclusively by the kidney (bile:urine ratio 0.06:1). Enalapril was eliminated in approximately equal amounts in bile and urine (ratio 0.7:1) while spirapril diacid showed a slight preference for the bile (ratio 2.6:1). 5. The physical chemical properties of FPL 63547 diacid may be responsible for its unusual preference for biliary elimination. In particular, the amphipathic character and strong acid functionality of the compound are thought to favour transport into the bile. 6. Elimination by the biliary route will be preferred in patients whose renal function is impaired as a result of disease or age. In such patients the elimination of renally-excreted ACE inhibitors is known to be compromised, resulting in compound accumulation and the need for closer monitoring. Therefore, the elimination profile of FPL 63547, if confirmed in man, may prove to be clinically advantageous.", 
    "224": "1. FPL 63547, in its active diacid form, was a potent inhibitor of rabbit lung angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro (IC50 0.51 nM). 2. In conscious normotensive dogs, FPL 63547 (10-300 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) produced prolonged, dose-related inhibition of plasma ACE activity and angiotensin I pressor responses, without affecting basal blood pressure, heart rate or pressor responses to angiotensin II. 3. In anaesthetized dogs, FPL 63547 diacid (3-300 micrograms kg-1 i.v. cumulatively) produced dose-related increases in cardiac output accompanied by falls in total peripheral resistance indicative of vasodilatation. Mild stimulation of cardiac rate and contractility was also observed. Enalapril diacid had a similar profile. 4. FPL 63547 was a highly effective antihypertensive agent after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) pretreated with a diuretic. It lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) on acute administration over the range 3 X 10(-7)-10(-5) mol kg-1 p.o. (congruent to 0.13-4.5 mg kg-1 p.o.). FPL 63547 was more potent than other ACE inhibitors tested, threshold active doses for lisinopril, enalapril and captopril being 10(-6), 10(-6) and 3 X 10(-5) mol kg-1 p.o., respectively. The antihypertensive effects of FPL 63547, unlike those of enalapril and captopril, were of long duration. 5. The antihypertensive efficacy of FPL 63547 was also observed following chronic oral administration. A dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 day-1 once daily for 23 days produced a sustained reduction of SBP. By the end of the treatment period, SBP was significantly lowered both pre- and post-dose, i.e. effective 24 h control had been achieved. 6. The profile of FPL 63547 is consistent with it being a potent, selective and long-acting ACE inhibitor. As an antihypertensive agent in SHR it compared favourably with other members of this class with respect to potency and duration of action.", 
    "225": "1. The activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been studied on functional parameters of intact isolated preparations of extrapulmonary tissues. The conversion of angiotensin I (A I) to angiotensin II (A II) and the cleavage of bradykinin (BK) were used as indicators of ACE activity. Captopril was employed as a specific inhibitor of ACE. 2. Captopril augmented the BK-induced contractions of the rat isolated uterus, the BK- and substance P-induced contractions of the guinea-pig ileum, and the BK-induced venoconstriction in the isolated perfused ear of the rabbit. Degradation of BK by ACE was calculated to be 52% in the rat uterus and 75% in the rabbit perfused ear. 3. Captopril inhibited the A I-induced contractions of the rat isolated colon, the A I-induced vasoconstriction in the isolated perfused ear of the rabbit and the rise in blood pressure induced by i.a. injections of A I in pithed rats. Conversion of A I to A II was calculated to be 13% in the rat colon and 26% in the rabbit perfused ear. 4. From estimations of the A II activity (bioassay on the rat colon) in the effluent of the perfused ear of the rabbit after injections of A I into the arterial inflow cannula it was calculated that approximately one tenth of A I was converted to A II during a single passage through the ear (less than 15 s). 5. The present experiments suggest that the high activity of ACE in endothelium of blood vessels of extrapulmonary tissues may provide an additional (endothelium-dependent) local vasoconstrictor mechanism by the rapid formation of A II and inactivation of BK. The ACE activity in non-vascular smooth muscles, other than those of blood vessels, may also affect the physiological functions of these tissues.", 
    "226": "The aim of the present study was to further validate our method for the determination of minimal forearm vascular resistance after ischemia (13 min arterial occlusion and 1 min hand exercise) in patients with hypertension. This parameter, calculated as the ratio of mean blood pressure (intra-arterial recordings on the experimental side) to forearm blood flow (strain-gauge venous plethysmography), was measured basally and after either increasing (through unrelated vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside or the calcium antagonist nicardipine in six mild-to-moderate uncomplicated hypertensives) or decreasing (norepinephrine, n = 4) flow without changes in systemic pressure. In spite of the divergent starting flow values, minimal postischemic forearm vascular resistance was unchanged, indicating a lack of relationship with functional arteriolar tone and the achievement of maximal dilatation. In two additional groups of patients, systemic arterial pressure was decreased by approximately equipotent oral doses of either nifedipine, a calcium antagonist (n = 6), or captopril, an angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 5). Under these conditions, minimal forearm vascular resistance was unchanged from pretreatment values, suggesting that local autoregulatory mechanisms were overridden during the reactive hyperemia, and that the vessel lumen was dependent on the distending pressure. Overall, the data show that our experimental conditions are suitable for measuring minimal forearm vascular resistance as a functional correlate of the morphological status of systemic arterioles in arterial hypertension.",

Quality of life was assessed from self-completed questionnaires. A significant fall in diastolic blood pressure occurred with both captopril (106.7 +/- 7.0 to 98.6 +/- 8.6 mmHg) and atenolol (107.4 +/- 7.5 to 98.2 +/- 8.1 mmHg) but there was no difference between the two drugs in the size of the fall.

There was a significant increase in the reporting of cough and runny nose in those on captopril compared with atenolol. A health index increased by 1.1% with captopril in comparison with no change on atenolol (difference 1.1%; 95% Cl - 2.0%, 4.2%). Psychological well-being was measured using the Symptom Rating Test.

The main questions regarding the RAS that can be addressed by molecular biology are: (1) How can new inhibitors of the RAS be designed? Molecular cloning of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme and production of the corresponding recombinant protein are the basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of catalysis and for identifying residues corresponding to catalytic subsites. (2) Do local RASs exist and, if so, what is their physiological importance? Cloned genes of this system represent specific probes that can be used to identify the sites of transcription and to evaluate the degree of expression of the genes by measuring the level of their mRNA. (3) Is elevation of blood pressure in essential hypertension related to an abnormality in one of the RAS genes? Cloning of the different genes has allowed the detection of polymorphism at the nucleotide level, representing inter-individual variations of the sequences of the genes.", 
    "229": "When inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were initially developed, they were believed to act as antihypertensive agents mainly under pathophysiological conditions, in which an elevated plasma RAS contributed to the elevation and maintenance of high blood pressure (BP). However, evidence has accumulated from studies in hypertensive patients, as well as in animals, indicating that BP could be lowered by converting-enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) independently of whether or not the plasma RAS was stimulated. Several other effects had to be considered. It was thus discovered that converting enzyme (CE) is identical with the bradykinin-degrading enzyme, kininase II, and CEIs can therefore potentiate the vasodepressor effects of bradykinin and thereby interact with the prostaglandin system. Actions of CEIs possibly unrelated to inhibition of angiotensin and kininase also need to be considered. The actions of CEIs at the tissue level (brain, heart, blood vessels, kidney, adrenal gland) and their interference with the autonomic nervous system through central and peripheral actions may under certain conditions be more important than their inhibition of the circulating hormonal plasma angiotensin II. Recent clinical and experimental studies and new insights in the molecular biology of the RAS, especially gene expression of renin and angiotensinogen in tissues of the cardiovascular system, support this view. We have found that chronic CE inhibition with substances such as captopril, quinapril and lisinopril specifically affects angiotensinogen mRNA levels in cardiovascular tissues, and has marked effects on left ventricular hypertrophy, possibly through an action on cardiac angiotensin. These findings have consequences not only for the understanding of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CEIs but also for their practical therapeutic use.", 
    "230": "1. We previously found that kidneys isolated from salt-restricted rats were refractory to atrial natriuretic peptide compared with kidneys from salt-loaded rats. Because the intrarenal tissue renin-angiotensin system may modulate renal responses to atrial natriuretic peptide, we examined the effect of dietary NaCl loading on the responses of isolated perfused kidneys from normal rats to atrial natriuretic peptide, before and after the addition of angiotensin II receptor antagonists or angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors to the perfusate. 2. Atrial natriuretic peptide increased the glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion of kidneys from NaCl-loaded rats. The addition of angiotensin receptor antagonists or converting enzyme inhibitors partially reversed the increments in glomerular filtration rate but not the increments in sodium excretion, leading to an increased fractional sodium excretion. In the absence of atrial natriuretic peptide, these agents did not affect glomerular filtration or sodium excretion. Kidneys from NaCl-restricted rats did not respond to atrial natriuretic peptide or to the inhibitors and antagonists, either separately or in combination. 3. After NaCl loading, the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system may augment the glomerular response to atrial natriuretic peptide while simultaneously inhibiting the natriuretic response to atrial natriuretic peptide. However, activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system is not responsible for the refractoriness of kidneys from salt-restricted rats to atrial natriuretic peptide.", 
    "231": "Selectivity of captopril, enalapril (MK-421), enalaprilat (MK-422), ketoace, and SA-300 for inhibiting kininase II when angiotensin (ANG) I versus bradykinin (BK) is the substrate has been studied in vitro. Potency for inhibiting purified rabbit lung ANG I-converting enzyme (ACE) using a tripeptide substrate with an ANG I-like (hippurylhistidylleucine, HHL) or a BK-like (hippurylphenylalanylarginine, HPA) cleavable dipeptide was determined. Inhibition of ANG I-induced and potentiation of BK-induced contractions of isolated guinea pig ileum strips was measured. For the enzyme assay, the inhibitor concentration which reduced the rate of HHL and HPA hydrolysis 50% (IC50) from the control value was estimated. All tested compounds more potently inhibited hydrolysis of the ANG I-related tripeptide by the purified enzyme. Ketoace, with a selectivity ratio (HPA IC50:HHL IC50) of 23, was the most substrate-dependent inhibitor. For the isolated ileum assay, the inhibitor concentration which augmented the contractile response to BK by 50% (AC50) or inhibited the contractile response to ANG I by 50% (IC50) was calculated. Only enalaprilat retained a selectivity ratio (BK AC50:ANG I IC50) in the guinea pig ileum system greater than one. Ketoace, with a ratio of 0.038, was the least ANG I-selective by this criterion. In vivo selectivity data on captopril seem more in accord with the ileum, rather than the enzyme, results. It was concluded that converting enzyme inhibitors differ in their relative selectivity for inhibiting kininase II reactions using different substrates.", 
    "232": "Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), often used in critically ill patients, reduces cardiac output, and its adverse effects on splanchnic circulation imply a risk of regional secondary organ failure. To investigate if the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) mediates PEEP-induced circulatory changes, hemodynamic effects of PEEP were measured in four groups of pigs: controls (C), nephrectomized (N), or given enalaprilate, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (E), or saralasin, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II (S). Groups N, E and S represented interference with RAS effects at different sites. With PEEP at 10 cmH2O, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, portal venous and hepatic arterial blood flow decreased in all groups, while portal and central venous pressures rose, without significant intergroup difference. Systemic and preportal bloodflow resistance increased in groups S and N, and hepatic arterial resistance in group C. Accentuation of the flow and pressure changes occurred with 20 cm PEEP in all groups, with increase of systemic and hepatic resistance in S and N, or preportal resistance in group N and protal resistance in group C. The study suggested that RAS is not a major mediator of PEEP-induced circulatory changes. Differing responses within groups N, S and E may have been due to interference with the action of RAS and of other vasoactive substances.", 
    "233": "The pressor response to norepinephrine (NE) was assessed in normal renin essential hypertensive patients before and after they were randomly assigned to receive in parallel groups of treatment a single dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril or lisinopril) or a prolonged therapy with lisinopril (30-45 days) or with hydrochlorothiazide (9 days). Blood pressure was significantly reduced by all treatments. The pressor response to NE was unchanged after the single administration of the ACE inhibitors, while it was blunted after chronic administration of lisinopril and after the diuretic. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the attenuation of the sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction may represent an additional mechanism contributing to the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors administered chronically.",

    "238": "The beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on myocardial mass and contractility in hypertension and, possibly, congestive heart failure (CHF) may be related to their ability to induce a decreased afterload. This has been assessed in four experimental models--renovascular hypertension, DOCA-salt hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and myocardial infarction (MI)--and in normotensive mature rats. In renovascular hypertension, ACE inhibitors normalized blood pressure as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and hypocontractility. In the DOCA-salt model, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by ACE inhibitors did not decrease blood pressure and therefore had no effect on cardiac mass and contractility. In the SHR model, the arterial smooth muscle cell is functionally and structurally abnormal; as a result, cardiac overload led, over time, to a terminal, decompensated phase of CHF. ACE inhibitors, by decreasing blood pressure, reversed cardiac hypertrophy, hyperfibrosis and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) oversecretion and prevented overload and time-induced CHF. In the MI model, ACE inhibitors decreased blood pressure and thereby decreased overload and reversed cardiac hypertrophy, hypocontractility, hyperfibrosis and ANF oversecretion. In normal ageing, heart function and structure are modified over time. ACE inhibitors, by blocking a 'normal' signal upstream, allowed a 'normal' effector system to decrease blood pressure and prevented the development of age-dependent cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "239": "Experiments were performed on anesthetized rats to determine whether inhibition of endopeptidase 24.11 (EP) potentiates the biological activity of atrial natriuretic peptide, ANP-(99-126), and to examine the mechanisms that underlie this effect. Thiorphan (30 mg/kg iv), an inhibitor of EP, produced a modest increase in urinary sodium excretion when administered alone but did not affect urine flow, mean arterial pressure (MAP), or the endogenous level of plasma ANP. The infusion of ANP-(99-126) alone (67 ng.kg-1.min-1 iv) produced a modest natriuresis and decrease in MAP while increasing plasma ANP levels fivefold. When thiorphan (30 mg/kg iv) was administered during the ANP infusion, urine flow and urinary sodium excretion increased markedly but no further decrease in MAP or increase in plasma ANP levels was observed. This potentiation of the renal actions of ANP was not mediated by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, an increase in glomerular filtration rate, or an increase in renal blood flow but was completely abolished by a specific antagonist of the bradykinin receptor [( DArg0, Hyp3, Thi5, DPhe7, Thi8]bradykinin, 30 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv). These data suggest that inhibitors of EP can potentiate the renal activity of ANP by a mechanism which is independent of altered ANP catabolism and which may involve the accumulation of bradykinin, another substrate for EP, within the kidney.", 
    "240": "The abilities of the ACE inhibitors captopril and SQ29,852 to modify aversive behaviour was compared to the effects of diazepam in the light/dark exploration test in the mouse, the elevated plus maze and social interaction test in the rat, and in anxiety-related behaviours induced by human threat in the marmoset. In the four tests the acute administration of captopril, SQ29,852 and diazepam had the same profiles of action to reduce aversive responding. This was also observed during chronic administration with the three agents in the mouse. However, withdrawal from a chronic treatment with diazepam precipitated a syndrome of increased aversion, whereas withdrawal from treatment with captopril and SQ29,852 was uneventful, values waning to control levels. Withdrawal from treatment with ethanol, nicotine and cocaine also enhanced aversive responding. Treatment with captopril and SQ29,852 antagonised the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from treatment with diazepam and nicotine and SQ29,852 also blocked the consequences of withdrawal from ethanol and cocaine. It is concluded that captopril and SQ29,852 have an anxiolytic profile of action in 3 species, that cessation of treatment is not associated with a withdrawal syndrome, that the ACE inhibitors cross tolerate with diazepam and can antagonise the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from treatment with drugs of abuse.", 
    "241": "Enalapril produces an inhibition of the angiotensin-renin system, correlating the pre-therapy plasmatic renin activity with blood pressure decrease, during its administration. This does not always happen, data to the contrary existing in literature, suggesting that there are some other acting mechanisms. We studied 34 hypertensive patients, whose blood pressure levels were controlled by Enalapril at a mean dosage of 12.32 +/- 0.9. Determining plasmatic concentration of 6-keto PGF1a (a prostacyclin metabolite), T x B2 (a thromboxane A2 metabolite), their distribution, plasmatic renin activity and a radiological and biochemical study. We found a significant increase in their distribution and plasmatic renin at the end of the essay. The results suggest a possible double active mechanism: angiotension-renin and prostaglandins systems, owing to the imbalance occurring between prostacyclin and thromboxane, the first named being the most favoured. This, together with easy application and the lack of side effects, made this drug useful for treatment of blood hypertension.", 
    "242": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) have been found effective in numerous cases of arterial hypertension, even non renovascular, and they are now widely used. However, the reference compound, captopril, has exhibited various side-effects, including acute renal failure. Different mechanisms may be responsible for this complication. In some case haemodynamic changes occur which are rapidly reversible after treatment is discontinued. In other, less frequent cases, captopril induces an immunoallergic interstitial nephritis, sometimes accompanied by skin rashes and/or eosinophilia. Since renal biopsies have been performed in only a few cases of CEI-induced nephropathy, we thought that it might be of interest to report a case of acute renal failure due to acute interstitial nephritis with epithelioid granulomas in the interstitium. The favourable outcome was confirmed by two successive follow-up renal biopsies.", 
    "243": "Cocaine, like catecholamines or angiotensin II, may induce lethal cardiac or cerebral damage. Restrained rats were fitted with a caudal arterial catheter for on-line cardiovascular monitoring and antidote administration. They were given 60 mg/kg of cocaine i.p., a dose which produces behavioral and cardiovascular effects, convulsions and death in an average time of 10 min. Selected antidotes were administered 5 min after the lethal dose of cocaine. Incidence of lethality was not changed by propranolol, prazosin, labetalol, diazepam or enalaprilat, a converting enzyme inhibitor. Animals treated with any one of the following agents, alpha- or beta-blockers, diazepam or competitive inhibitors of angiotensin II [Sar-1-ile-8] and [Sar-1-thr-8] angiotensin II, presented myocardial infarction. All animals treated with calcium channel antagonists or enalaprilat, whether they survived or not, did not present myocardial infarction. Treatment with nitrendipine, flunarizine or diltiazem, resulted in survival of the animals with no observable aftereffects. Similar results were observed when enalaprilat was administered, with diazepam as an antidote, to a lethal dose of cocaine. Antagonists to the sympatho-adrenal system and to the renin angiotensin system appear to be effective antidotes to cocaine toxicity in the present experimental model.", 
    "244": "The effects of various antihypertensive treatments on the echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy were studied in 75 patients with essential hypertension. The hemodynamic effects of the therapy during exercise were also compared. LV mass by echocardiogram was significantly reduced by beta-blockade and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI), but only slightly reduced by Ca channel blockade. QRS high voltage criteria of LV hypertrophy by electrocardiogram were reduced by all 3 of these antihypertensive treatments. At submaximal exercise, the pressor responses were attenuated by captopril, but not influenced by metoprolol or nifedipine. The increase in plasma norepinephrine by exercise was significantly suppressed after captopril, but was somewhat augmented after metoprolol or nifedipine. These observations indicate that the responses of hemodynamics and sympathetic nervous activity to exercise are different after the treatment by beta-blocker, Ca channel blocker or ACEI, in spite of the equal antihypertensive effect. However, it is suggested that the regression of LV hypertrophy might be induced by antihypertensive therapy, though the different grade by the individual drug.", 
    "245": "Contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) to basal mean arterial pressure (MAP) were evaluated in near-term pregnant and virgin rats as follows. MAP and heart rate (HR) were measured before and after ganglionic, alpha-adrenoreceptor, RAS, and/or AVP blockade. In addition, pressor responses to angiotensin II (ANG II), norepinephrine, phenylephrine, or AVP were determined in ganglionic-blocked animals. In both groups decrements in MAP were greatest after ganglionic or alpha-blockade, intermediate after RAS blockade, and negligible after AVP-V1 antagonism ([d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)]AVP). Recovery of MAP was also similar in the two groups except after phentolamine when MAP and HR remained lower in gravid rats. Superimposition of RAS or AVP blockade during phentolamine infusion suggested that ANG II and AVP were less effective in supporting MAP during alpha-blockade in pregnancy. Pressor responses to ANG II and norepinephrine during ganglionic blockade were markedly blunted during pregnancy; however, those to phenylephrine and AVP were unchanged. We conclude that contributions of ANS, RAS, and AVP to basal MAP are similar in pregnant and virgin rats; neural mechanisms dominating in both groups. However, recovery during alpha-blockade is impaired during gestation, apparently due to blunted HR responses and decreased pressor contributions of ANG II and AVP. This may be explained, in part, by decreased vascular reactivity to ANG II, although a similar mechanism cannot be invoked for AVP.", 
    "246": "Despite recent controversies in hypertension management, family physicians can confidently follow a straightforward diagnostic and treatment approach. Routine use of echocardiography or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring is not recommended in the initial work-up of hypertension. The optimum goal for the diastolic blood pressure remains at 80 to 85 mm Hg. As many as 20 to 25 percent of patients with mild hypertension become normotensive with dietary modifications, exercise and alcohol cessation. In patients with mild hypertension, these nonpharmacologic approaches should be tried for three to six months before drug therapy is instituted. Initial drug therapy should be chosen on the basis of effectiveness, ease of administration, tolerability, cost and long-term safety record. Many of the reported adverse metabolic effects of diuretics may be of limited clinical significance. Despite the availability of newer antihypertensives, diuretics remain a choice in most patients as initial therapy or as a step-2 drug.", 
    "247": "1. We have examined in guinea-pigs, in vivo, the effects of inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on the airway response to aerosolised substance P (SP). We aerosolised captopril (4.6 mM, 60 breaths; 210 nmol) to inhibit ACE and acetorphan (0.3, 1 and 3 mM, 60 breaths; 9 nmol, 33 nmol and 110 nmol respectively) to inhibit NEP. We also examined the effect of the highest dose of acetorphan (110 nmol) on the response to aerosolised acetylcholine (ACh). 2. Responsiveness to SP (or ACh) was measured as the change in lung resistance (RL) induced by nebulisation of increasing concentrations of SP (or ACh) before and after treatment with the inhibitor. PC200, defined as the provocative concentration inducing an increase in RL of 200% above baseline was calculated for each challenge. 3. Administration of acetorphan before the second SP-challenge induced a dose-dependent decrease in PC200 for SP amounting to 1.8 (+/- 0.3) log units after treatment with 11 nmol acetorphan. Treatment with vehicle before the second SP-challenge or with 3 mM acetorphan before the second ACh-challenge had no significant effect on PC200. 4. Treatment with captopril (21 nmol) induced only a small, nonsignificant leftward shift of PC200 to SP (0.3 +/- 0.2 log units). 5. We conclude that a NEP-like enzyme, but not ACE, regulates the response to aerosolised SP. We suggest that the same is true for SP released endogenously from sensory nerve endings in the airway epithelial layer.", 
    "248": "Albuminuria (UAlbV) can be reduced by converting-enzyme inhibitors (CEI), but the hormonal mechanism responsible for this effect has not previously been defined. Since CEI increase kinin activity as well as reduce angiotensin II (ANG II) activity, experiments were performed to determine the effect of isolated alterations in kinin and ANG II metabolism on UAlbV in rats with passive Heymann pephritis. Phosphoramidon was used to potentiate kinin activity without altering ANG II synthesis. Aprotinin was utilized in combination with the CEI, enalapril, to prevent the increase in kinin activity caused by CEI. UAlbV and the fractional renal clearance of albumin (FCAlb) decreased significantly after either phosphoramidon or enalapril, although only enalapril reduced blood pressure. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not affected by either drug. Phosphoramidon did not affect plasma renin activity (PRA) or the pressor response to angiotensin I (ANG I), indicating that ANG II synthesis was not altered. Aprotinin prevented the reduction in UAlbV and FCAlb produced by CEI but not the hypotension, elevated PRA, or ANG I pressor blockade produced by CEI. Aprotinin alone had no effect on UAlbV, GFR, PRA, or blood pressure. UAlbV can be reduced by increasing kinin activity by a mechanism that is not dependent on suppression of ANG II activity or reduction in GFR or blood pressure. CEI may reduce proteinuria as a result of their action on the kallikrein-kinin system rather than on the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "249": "The acute effects of various antihypertensive agents on cerebral blood flow and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were studied in anesthetized (amobarbital 100 mg/kg) spontaneously hypertensive rats. Cerebral blood flow in the cortex and thalamus was measured by the hydrogen clearance method before and during a 60-min i.v. infusion of calcium antagonist (nifedipine), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) or beta-blocker (propranolol). Nifedipine, 30 or 150 micrograms/kg per h, decreased dose dependently the MAP by 20 or 31%, and concomitantly increased cortical blood flow by 28 or 74%, and thalamic blood flow by 51 or 64%, respectively. Captopril, 10 or 100 mg/kg per h, decreased MAP by 7 or 14%, but changed cerebral blood flow minimally. In contrast, propranolol, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg per h, decreased MAP by 13 or 11%, with a concomitant reduction of cortical and thalamic blood flow by 20 or 15 and 33 or 37%, respectively. It is concluded that the changes in cerebral blood flow in response to hypotension are varied by antihypertensive drugs depending on the direct or indirect effect of the drugs (dilatation or constriction) on cerebral vessels. Nifedipine seems to dilate while propranolol constricts cerebral vessels.", 
    "250": "Angiotensin I and II inhibited the nerve stimulation-induced pressure changes in isolated, perfused rabbit ear artery with an IC50 of 3.07 and 0.36 nM, respectively. Neither angiotensin I nor angiotensin II affected the basal pressure or the pressure changes elicited by exogenously administered norepinephrine (NE). The potency of angiotensin I was unaltered by 10(-5) M captopril, indicating that conversion by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was not necessary and did not take place. [Sar1,Val5,Ala8]angiotensin II (3 x 10(-8) M) antagonized the effect of angiotensin I. These findings could have implications regarding ACE inhibitor therapy and the pathophysiology of migraine.", 
    "251": "The value of digitalis in the treatment of heart failure with sinus rhythm remains controversial. It has been demonstrated that the moderate positively inotropic effect of digitalis observed after acute administration persists without tachyphylaxis. Digitalis produces symptomatic improvement, but its therapeutic quotient is low and its influence on mortality is unknown. This last point has become crucial, especially since some positively inotropic drugs increase ventricular rhythm disorders and are responsible for over-mortality among heart failure patients. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with severe heart failure. In short, digitalis is useful only in certain physiopathological types of heart failure where it is used electively and complements the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "252": "Forty patients with mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension were randomized for double-blind treatment with ketanserin (20 mg b.i.d.) vs. captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) for fifteen days. Diastolic pressure was normalized (less than 90 mmHg) in 11 out of 20 patients of both groups. Of the 18 patients not responding to monotherapy, 17 were treated for 45 days with a combination of both drugs at the same dosages. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized in 15 out of these 17, and in one patient it was reduced by more than 10%. Thus the success rate of therapy was 94%.", 
    "253": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a hormone whose potent hemodynamic and renal actions might be beneficial in several cardiovascular disorders, but whose poor oral absorption and extremely rapid inactivation in vivo have so far prevented its therapeutic use. We have developed simple tests to study the peptidases responsible for the hydrolysis of ANF in mice in vivo and to assess the effects of peptidase inhibitors. In mice injected with 125I-ANF in low amounts the radioactivity present in kidney, a major target organ for the hormone, was analysed by HPLC, precipitation with trichloracetic acid (TCA) and in a membrane binding assay. All three parameters indicated a rapid inactivation of the hormone: 20 s after injection of 125I-ANF the intact hormone represented less than 20% of the total kidney radioactivity. Oral pretreatment with acetorphan, a potent enkephalinase inhibitor resulted in a marked increase in the amount of intact 125I-ANF (6-fold), TCA-precipitated (5-fold) and membrane bound radioactivity (4-fold) in the kidney; the total kidney radioactivity was enhanced by approximately 2-fold. A similar protective effect was observed with other enkephalinase inhibitors, i.e. thiorphan and kelatorphan; the latter was effective at a 10-fold higher dosage. In contrast, a large variety of inhibitors of metallo-, cysteine, serine and aspartic proteinases had no or only marginal effects. Instead, captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reduced the total and TCA-precipitable radioactivity in the kidneys. Aminopeptidase inhibitors, used either alone or in conjunction with acetorphan, displayed significant but limited protective effects. The crucial role of enkephalinase in ANF inactivation in vivo suggests that inhibitors of this peptidase could be used in a novel therapeutic approach to cardiovascular or renal diseases by protecting endogenous ANF.",

    "262": "There is substantial evidence that the failing heart is in an energy-depleted state. The imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand might be the cause for adaptive metabolic changes seen in patients with severe chronic heart failure. By analyzing the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme pattern, an increase of LDH5 and a decrease of LDH1 was seen in myocardium from patients with chronic heart failure. Additionally, the concentration of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) carrier was significantly elevated. After treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in 33 patients with chronic heart failure, LDH1 increased from 38.7 +/- 6.7 to 42.3 +/- 5.5 (p less than 0.005), paralleled by a decrease in LDH5 from 20.8 +/- 7.0 to 15.8 +/- 4.7 (p less than 0.001). The ADP/ATP carrier concentration also decreased significantly within the normal range. There was a good correlation between the hemodynamic data and the LDH isoenzyme pattern. The shift of the LDH isoenzyme pattern and the decrease of the ADP/ATP concentration can be taken as an indication for an improvement of the myocardial energy balance in chronic heart failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.", 
    "263": "The main objectives of chronic drug treatment in essential hypertension are to decrease blood pressure, improve prognosis, reduce the number and severity of adverse effects to a minimum, and use simple treatment schedules. Simple treatment schedules may be easily maintained with monotherapy (i.e., beta blockers, diuretics, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). If monotherapy is insufficiently effective, antihypertensive drugs can be combined. Combination therapy makes use of the synergistic effects of most antihypertensive drugs. Further considerations of combination therapy of antihypertensive agents are the inhibition of compensatory mechanisms working against blood pressure reduction and the decrease of the frequency and severity of adverse effects. Combinations of 2 antihypertensive agents usually contain a diuretic or a calcium antagonist.", 
    "264": "Cardiac function in myocardial infarction (MI) depends on the extent of damage in ischemic myocardium and the compensatory response of residual myocardium. Because thrombolytic therapy is performed in many patients, reperfusion of ischemic myocardium may take place at various stages of progression of the ischemic insult. If perfusion is reestablished before necrosis occurs, myocardium may recover immediately or after hours to weeks (\"stunned myocardium\"). If coronary occlusion persists, necrosis develops in the subendocardium, propagates transmurally and forms a scar after the healing phase. Residual myocardium responds to loss of contractile tissue and material properties of the ischemic zone by hypertrophy and dilatation. This study shows that left ventricular dilatation is accompanied by an increase in stroke volume from 4 days to 4 weeks; however, left ventricular dilatation progresses while stroke volume remains constant from 4 weeks to 6 months, suggestive of noncompensatory left ventricular dilatation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce lactate production after 60 seconds, and infarct size after 6 hours of coronary occlusion in dogs. Stunned myocardium recovers faster in animal experiments and pacing-induced myocardial ischemia may be prevented by ACE inhibitors. Left ventricular dilatation and mortality is reduced by ACE inhibitors in rats after MI. Several potential mechanisms are discussed to establish a favorable action of ACE inhibitors at various stages of MI. Clinical evidence is still pending; however, large studies are ongoing to clarify potential indications of ACE inhibitors in ischemic heart disease in humans.", 
    "265": "Hypertensive damage to the target organ \"heart\" comprises the sum and interactions of the cardiac organ manifestations of arterial hypertension such as myocardial hypertrophy and disease of large and small coronary arteries. Because the prognosis of arterial hypertension is determined to a considerable extent by these cardiac complications, the aim of treatment of hypertensive heart disease is reversal of the myocardial hypertrophy in order to prevent later progression to hypertensive heart failure. A further goal of therapy is reversal of the hypertensive small coronary disease in order to improve the coronary reserve. Once the stage of hypertensive heart failure is reached, the principles of medical management of heart failure with digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors apply. Whereas the evidence that regression of hypertrophy can be induced by suitable antihypertensive drugs (calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine type, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and sympathicolytic substances) is practically conclusive, clinical evidence of reversal of the hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries has yet to be provided. Moreover, to what extent the prognosis of hypertensive heart disease can be improved by reversal of hypertrophy is still unknown.", 
    "266": "There are several indications that the oxygen supply to the myocardium is inadequate in chronic heart failure. This is due to an increased intramyocardial vascular resistance, elevated filling pressures, and a shortened diastolic perfusion time. In parallel, the myocardial oxygen demand is heightened due to elevated wall stress, heart rate and contractility. This imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand might be the cause of the adaptive metabolic changes seen in severe chronic heart failure. We showed increased LDH 5, decreased LDH 1 and increased ADP/ATP-carrier concentration in the myocardium from patients with chronic heart failure. After ACE-inhibitor treatment in 33 patients with chronic heart failure, LDH 1 increased from 38.7 +/- 6.7% to 42.3 +/- 5.5% (P less than 0.005) paralleled by a decrease in LDH 5 from 20.8 +/- 7.0% to 15.8 +/- 4.7% (P less than 0.001). The ADP/ATP-carrier concentration also decreased significantly within the normal range. This shift in the LDH isoenzyme pattern and decrease in the ADP/ATP-concentration can be interpreted as an indication for an improvement of myocardial energy balance in chronic heart failure under ACE-inhibitor therapy. This might help interrupt the self-perpetuation of chronic heart failure which is partially caused by a progressive subendocardial perfusion deficit.",

In wet granulations, basic agents, however, were found to suppress drug degradation even in the presence of moisture.

    "268": "We describe the use of fludrocortisone in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, who initially presented with moderate renal insufficiency, high serum potassium, metabolic acidosis, low urine pH, and a high urinary anion gap indicating tubular dysfunction. Renal histology revealed membranous glomerulonephritis and interstitial inflammation. During the course of the disease the patient developed persistent severe hyperkalemia. Dietary potassium restriction and therapy with diuretics combined with cation exchange resins failed to decrease potassium levels sufficiently. Drug therapy including cyclosporin A, enalapril, atenolol, phenytoin, necessary to control active disease and severe hypertension contributed to elevated potassium levels. Effective correction of hyperkalemia was achieved by fludrocortisone treatment. We conclude that fludrocortisone is a potent therapeutic approach for selected patients suffering from life threatening hyperkalemia, in whom potassium elevating drugs cannot be withdrawn.",

    "274": "When enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was orally administered to inseminated rabbits at dosages of 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day for 13 days in a range-finding study, nephrotoxicity, as measured by elevated serum urea nitrogen concentrations, occurred at 1 mg/kg/day and higher dosages and significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) increases in fetal wastage were observed at dosages as low as 3 mg/kg/day. Saline supplementation during treatment prevented this rise in urea nitrogen. Fetal wastage was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) increased in the absence of maternotoxicity when saline-supplemented females were treated with enalapril at 30 mg/kg/day. A developmental toxicity study of enalapril in saline-supplemented rabbits produced no evidence of teratogenicity at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day. The period of sensitivity of fetuses to the toxic effects of enalapril was found to be limited to middle-to-late gestation (Gestational Days 14-27).

Pharmacol. 87, 533-542), which demonstrated that the sheep fetus becomes markedly hypotensive when the dam is treated with captopril or enalapril during late pregnancy, we believe that the observed fetotoxicity of enalapril in rabbits is also due to fetal hypotension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Acute vs. chronic physiological alterations of glomerular hemodynamics that result from inhibition of either PG or ANG II, or both, and their interaction were examined.

Dual 4- to 6-day treatment decreased single-nephron filtration rate (SNGFR, 24 +/- 2 vs. 33 +/- 2 nl/min in control; P less than 0.05) as a result of decreases in single-nephron plasma flow (SNPF) and glomerular hydrostatic pressure gradient (delta P). Treatment with enalapril alone for 4-6 days did not reduce SNGFR and SNPF; however, delta P decreased. Acute addition of meclofenamate did not alter these factors. SNGFR was decreased with 4- to 6-day treatment of meclofenamate from 33 +/- 2 in control to 25 +/- 1 nl/min (P less than 0.05). Acute treatment with enalapril in the 4- to 6-day meclofenamate-treated rats increased SNGFR to values not different from control. The results demonstrated that glomerular hemodynamic alterations consequent to inhibition of ANG II and PG systems differ between chronic and acute treatments. Therefore, interpretation of the role of individual hormonal systems in the control of glomerular hemodynamics should be approached with caution, since effects may be altered by duration of treatment and involvement of other vasoactive systems.", 
    "276": "To evaluate the influence of multiple dose propranolol administration on the single dose pharmacokinetics of quinapril and its active metabolite, quinaprilat, a drug-drug interaction study was performed in ten healthy volunteers. Each subject received a single 20 mg quinapril oral dose on Days 1 and 16 of the study. Oral propranolol doses of 40 mg BID were initiated on Day 3, titrated gradually to 80 mg TID by Day 10, and continued at 80 mg TID through Day 17. Comparable mean quinapril pharmacokinetic parameter values as well as comparable mean quinaprilat pharmacokinetic parameter values determined following quinapril administered alone and following quinapril administered with propranolol, indicate that propranolol does not alter the single dose pharmacokinetics of quinapril or quinaprilat.", 
    "277": "In a randomized, blind trial, enalapril and captopril were compared in 479 patients with essential hypertension. The results showed that both enalapril and captopril had similar effects on the blood pressure. The response rate was 77.8% with enalapril and 70.4% with captopril. Blood pressure lowered 2.68/1.59 kPa (20.1/11.9 mmHg) in enalapril group versus 2.44/1.43 kPa (18.3/10.7 mmHg) in captopril group. No serious side effects were observed and both enalapril and captopril were well tolerated. Thus, enalapril and captopril appear equally effective and safe in patients with essential hypertension and enalapril is better accepted by patients because of its longer duration of antihypertensive activity.", 
    "278": "The LV diastolic function of 37 cases with primary hypertension were studied by measuring the diastolic filling blood stream at mitral orifice using pulsed Doppler echocardiography. 30/37 (81%) patients were found to have impaired LV diastolic function as compared with 30 normals of a group at similar age. After 4 weeks of oral captopril treatment in 20/37 patients, BP dropped in 19/20; LV diastolic function improved in 75-80%; left ventricular mass also regressed in 16/20 captopril treated patients (210 +/- 62 vs 171 +/- 46 g, P less than 0.01). It showed that captopril is not only effective in lowering blood pressure but also in improving the impaired LV diastolic function.", 
    "279": "We describe four cases of primary hyperaldosteronism whose initial presentation was a moderate to severe hypertension. In three patients an adrenal adenoma was found; in another patient was due to unilateral adrenal hyperplasia. A good therapeutic response was achieved in all cases by unilateral adrenalectomy. The captopril test (Lyons version) proved useful to exclude essential hypertension and, may be, in distinguishing the new sub-types of primary hyperaldosteronism recently described. Indeed, only in the case of unilateral adrenal hyperplasia a fall in plasma aldosterone levels was observed. However, we feel that further investigation is needed to clarify this point.", 
    "280": "Dynamic renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DTPA before (baseline renography: BS-RG) and 1 hour after administration of 25 mg to 50 mg of captopril (captopril-enhanced renography: CP-RG) was performed in a selected series of 18 patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension. Final diagnosis was made by angiography and further clinical follow-up. Eight patients were considered as renovascular hypertension (RVH), 6 with bilateral renal artery stenosis (BRAS) and 2 with unilateral renal artery stenosis (URAS). The remaining 10 patients were non-renovascular (non-RVH). Two criteria were prospectively employed for evaluating positive response induced by captopril. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on BS-RG (GFRbase) and on CP-RG (GFRcap) was estimated by early (120-180 seconds) DTPA uptake by the kidney, and then captopril response rate (CRR) was calculated in the following: CRR = (GFRcap-GFRbase)/GFRbase X 100 (%). CP-RG was considered positive when it was less than 20%. Renogram shape was also independently evaluated. CP-RG was also considered positive when either a delay of time to peak activity of more than 5 min or conversion of renogram shape to an obstructive or non-functioning pattern was observed. The sensitivity and specificity of CRR and change in renogram were 50% and 80%, 63% and 100%, respectively. In BRAS, positive response was observed in the unilateral kidney alone which maintained relatively a good renal function. CP-RG could not differentiate RVH with URAS from that with BRAS. Four patients were followed after the surgical or angioplastic treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "281": "Effect of renin inhibitor ES-1005 or captopril on the renin synthesis by the kidney was investigated in sodium-depleted marmosets. The level of kidney renin mRNA was measured after 2-hour (acute study) and one-week (chronic study) administrations of the two agents. Relative amounts of kidney renin mRNA were measured by densitometric Northern blot analysis using an alpha-32P-labelled human renin cDNA fragment as a hybridization probe. In the acute study, treatment with captopril significantly increased plasma renin activity (PRA) (p less than 0.05), but did not change the level of kidney renin mRNA. In the chronic study, treatment with captopril markedly increased PRA as well as the level of kidney renin mRNA (4.7-fold and 6.3-fold increases, respectively). In contrast, treatment with ES-1005 completely inhibited PRA and significantly suppressed the level of kidney renin mRNA in both acute and chronic studies (about one-third of the normal control, p less than 0.05). These results suggest that renin inhibitor ES-1005 not only inhibits plasma renin activity but also suppresses the synthesis of renin by the kidney.", 
    "282": "The aim of this study was to compare the effect of dilevalol and captopril on blood pressure and heart rate in hypertensive subjects, both at rest and during bicycle exercise. Thirty mild hypertensive patients (24 men, 6 women), aged 34-55, were studied in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial. After a 3-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to receive either dilevalol (200 mg once daily) or captopril (50 mg twice daily) for 4 weeks. Dilevalol-treated patients whose diastolic blood pressure had not decreased by more than 8 mmHg from baseline (or to less than 95 mmHg) were given 400 mg once daily for a further 2 weeks. Treatment was stopped for all other patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during bicycle exercise tests 4 (\"peak\") and 24 hours (\"trough\") after dosing in the dilevalol group and 4 (\"peak\") and 12 hours (\"trough\") after dosing in the captopril group. At the end of the placebo run-in, mean resting blood pressure was 156/102 mmHg in the dilevalol group and 157/103 in the captopril group. Six patients had blood pressure normalization with captopril and 9 with dilevalol 200 mg; a further 2 patients achieved normalized blood pressure levels with dilevalol 400 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "283": "Several experimental studies have suggested that the sulphydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has cardioprotective effects in the setting of acute myocardial ischaemia, ischaemia/reperfusion and infarction. We have observed that captopril can reduce the degree of dilatation and early functional myocardial infarct expansion produced by 3 h of permanent coronary artery occlusion in anaesthetized, open-chest dogs. In addition, captopril has been shown to limit experimental infarct size, reduce the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias, and improve contractile function of stunned myocardium. When administered chronically after myocardial infarction, both experimental and clinical evidence suggests that captopril reduces left ventricular dilatation. Captopril is currently being tested in large clinical trials as adjuvant therapy to thrombolysis.", 
    "284": "Experimental evidence suggests that ACE-inhibitors possess cardioprotective properties. Since ACE-inhibitors can prevent bradykinin breakdown and can stimulate prostaglandin production, it is thought that these cardioprotective effects are mediated by bradykinin and prostaglandins. This article summarizes the results indicating that bradykinin and prostaglandins, although not the only factors, do play an important role in cardioprotection by ACE-inhibitors. Special attention is paid to the presence of the sulphydryl moiety of certain ACE-inhibitors. Probably, these sulphydryl group-containing ACE-inhibitors have an additional protective effect through an interaction with bradykinin or through scavenging of free radicals. However, these cardioprotective effects have not yet been shown in patients with ischaemic heart disease, although some studies indicate that ACE-inhibitors are also able to cause anti-ischaemic effects in patients. Further studies are required to establish the clinical importance of cardioprotection by ACE-inhibitors in ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "285": "It has been speculated that ACE inhibitors may have beneficial effects in patients with coronary artery disease not only by their vasodilator properties but also by an effect on an assumed local renin-angiotensin system in atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a single intravenous infusion of captopril on haemodynamics and coronary diameter at rest and during myocardial ischaemia induced by rapid atrial pacing. The study was performed in 12 patients with coronary artery disease and exertional angina pectoris despite medical therapy. Central haemodynamics (PAO, PAP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were measured. Biplane cineventriculography and coronary arteriography were performed during control pacing (10% above the normal heart rate) before and after 15 min of captopril infusion, as well as during angina pectoris induced by rapid atrial pacing before and after captopril (six patients 0.15 mg kg-1, six patients 0.3 mg kg-1). Mean aortic pressure was not significantly decreased by either 0.15 mg kg-1 or 0.3 mg kg-1, whereas mean pulmonary pressure was significantly reduced by captopril by 28% at rest and 34% during rapid atrial pacing. Neither the endsystolic volume index nor left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly affected by captopril. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was reduced by 9% at rest and 7% during pacing-induced angina. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 11 +/- 9 mmHg to 4.8 +/- 4.1 mmHg at rest after captopril, and from 10 +/- 11 mmHg to 5.1 +/- 5.0 mmHg during pacing-induced angina after captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "286": "Evidence suggests that angiotensin II can affect macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses; however, whether it can affect neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses is not yet clear. We have previously demonstrated that components of the angiotensin system simulate bovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells to release a neutrophil chemoattractant. In the current study, we examined the effect of components of the angiotensin system on bovine and human pulmonary arterial and human aortic endothelial cells, and partially characterized this neutrophil chemoattractant. All endothelial cell types incubated with angiotensin II released neutrophil chemoattractant activity. This activity appeared within 1 min of exposure to angiotensin II, and was blocked by saralasin, an angiotensin II antagonist. The neutrophil chemoattractant also appeared after exposure to angiotensin I, but this effect required conversion to angiotensin II. Incubation with bradykinin, another substrate for angiotensin-converting enzyme, did not cause release of the neutrophil chemoattractant. Chemoattractant release was not inhibited by indomethacin but was blocked by diethylcarbamazine or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid. Following extraction, the neutrophil chemoattractant partitioned completely into the organic phase. High-pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated several peaks of chemoactivity, none of which co-eluted with known eicosanoid or phospholipid neutrophil chemoattractants. This study demonstrates that angiotensin II may influence neutrophil accumulation via production of neutrophil chemoattractant activity by vascular endothelial cells.", 
    "287": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme can rarely cause an angioneurotic edema of the upper airways. This complication depends on the interaction with hormones regulating the vascular resistance such as the kallikrein kinin and the prostaglandin systems. We present two cases of angioneurotic edema of the tongue induced by inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme. We describe the symptoms of this side effect and discuss possible therapeutic approaches.", 
    "288": "A group of 65 patients with advanced heart failure was examined with the aim to disclose changes in serum glucose, creatinine, potassium, chloride, and acid-base balance under the influence of intensive diuretic therapy. 50 patients were treated with ordinary furosemide and amiloride combination (average observation time 25 days), in 15 cases amiloride was replaced by captopril 75-150 mg/day (average observation 15.5 days). The results are as follows: 1. We found no rise of glycaemia in non-diabetics with either ordinary diuretic therapy or captopril. On the contrary: stress hyperglycaemia in the beginning of the therapy normalized in the course of it. 2. There was a significant rise of serum creatinine during the first two weeks of therapy with furosemide and amiloride. Reversal of this trend followed after captopril. 3. There was no fall in the average serum chloride concentration during ordinary diuretic therapy. Adding captopril to the regime brought about a rise in serum chloride. 4. Serum potassium had no tendency to fall either after furosemide and amiloride or furosemide and captopril. 5. The acid-base balance showed no shift towards metabolic alkalosis during an intensive but rational diuretic regime either with or without captopril. On the contrary: mild initial metabolic alkalosis had a tendency to normalize with proceeding cardiac compensation.", 
    "289": "This review focuses on the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertensive diseases. Specifically discussed are: proposed mechanisms of action, the pharmacology of the commercially available ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril), their renal effects, and their safety and efficacy. The ACE inhibitors are assuming a dominant role in our therapeutic armamentarium, in that they are well-tolerated and very effective in the treatment of mild, moderate or severe hypertension.", 
    "290": "To investigate mechanisms underlying GFR control in diabetes mellitus, renal hemodynamics and segmental tubular handling of sodium, using lithium clearance, were assessed in 41 insulin-dependent diabetics (IDD) treated by insulin for 11 +/- 8 days, and in 19 normal controls. Average GFR and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were slightly but not significantly higher (136 +/- 22 vs. 123 +/- 16 ml/min.1.73 m2) in IDD than in normal subjects. GFR and ERPF were positively and strongly correlated in controls (r = 0.61, P less than 0.001) and in diabetics (r = 0.72, P less than 0.0001) indicating the marked flow dependency of GFR in both populations. After adjustment for ERPF, GFR was significantly higher in diabetics, suggesting a role of increased glomerular capillary pressure and ultrafiltration coefficient in the subset of \"hyperfiltering\" patients. Both fractional (FPRNa) and absolute (APRNa) proximal sodium reabsorption were significantly higher in IDD and significantly correlated with GFR. The ensuing decrease in sodium distal delivery could deactivate the tubuloglomerular feedback response and thus favor sustained vasodilation and high GFR in some diabetics. The renal effects of acute administration of drugs acting predominantly at either the pre- or the postglomerular resistance using nicardipine (N = 16) or captopril (N = 25) were further evaluated in IDD. The renal response to captopril or nicardipine was different in IDD. Whereas both drugs induced a marked decrease in renal vascular resistance, GFR was slightly decreased by captopril and was unchanged after nicardipine; these results are similar to those observed in normotensive non-diabetic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "291": "Because the literature comparing the effects of vasodilators on forearm and calf vessels is very scarce, the authors compared different vasodilators used in cardiovascular medicine in a group of volunteers. The peripheral effects were measured in the sitting position by plethysmography at the calf and at the forearm. At the forearm, comparable dilator effects were seen in arteries and veins. At the calf there was a trend for arterial flow to decrease as venous capacitance increased. Vascular response seen in one limb was not representative of the whole circulation. The changes observed were dependent not only on the vascular area investigated but also on the dose used.", 
    "292": "This study reports on the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of captopril in 36 Sudanese patients, who were classified as resistant, moderate to severe and mild according to initial diastolic blood pressure and history of treatment. The patients were titrated against a six-step captopril treatment regime with or without hydrochlorothiazide and reserpine. The median follow up period was 11.6 month. The initial median pre-treatment blood pressure was 159/101, 182/120 and 217/130 and at the end of study 125/77, 120/74 and 165/95 for the mild, severe and resistant groups respectively. Tolerance was good and side effects were mild and similar to others reported in literature. The effective daily treatment was 25-50 mg captopril for mild hypertension, 50 to 100 mg captopril with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide for severe hypertension while it was 225 mg captopril with 50 to 100 mg hydrochlorothiazide and a need for a third drug in 30% of patients in the resistant group. These results reveal normal responsiveness to captopril among black Sudanese patients with good tolerance and safety.", 
    "293": "The acute haemodynamic effects of intravenous captopril were measured, and left ventricular function was analysed by radionuclide angiography in eleven patients with moderate to severe hypertension. All subjects received 1 mg captopril by bolus injection initially, followed at 10 minute intervals by 2 mg or 5 mg injections according to blood pressure response. Eight patients experienced an acute reduction of blood pressure whilst three patients remained unresponsive. The onset of action was within 5 minutes with a peak effect at 5 to 10 minutes and duration of action lasting 20 to 30 minutes. The haemodynamic effects were characterised by arteriolar dilatation (reduced systemic vascular resistance P less than 0.01), and apparent venous dilatation (reduced right atrial, pulmonary wedge pressure, P less than 0.05 and 0.01 respectively). Pulmonary vascular resistance was not altered, ejection fraction remained unchanged and isovolumic relaxation period was lengthened (119 +/- 20.1 to 147.39 +/- 21.15, P less than 0.05). Coronary perfusion pressure gradients dropped (123.8 +/- 5.6 to 107.1 +/- 11.3 mmHg, P less than 0.001) following intravenously administered captopril. Intravenous captopril is effective in reducing arterial pressure rapidly with minimal adverse effects. This suggests that it may be useful as an alternative regimen for severe hypertension. The prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation period accounted for the decrease of coronary filling load.", 
    "294": "We have investigated the use of captopril as a screening test for renovascular hypertension and compared the effects of captopril on renal function in patients with renovascular hypertension and those without renovascular hypertension. The captopril test and kidney gamma scintigraphy were carried out in 50 hypertensive patients, 13 with renovascular hypertension and 37 without. Blood samples were drawn for the determination of plasma renin activity and kidney gamma scintigraphy was done before and 60 minutes after 50 mg oral captopril administration. Results suggesting the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension are the following: a basal and stimulated plasma renin activity of 4 ng ml/hr or more and an absolute increase in plasma renin activity of 3 ng/ml/hr or more if basal plasma renin activity was less than 4 ng/ml/hr. Data from kidney gamma scintigraphy showed that captopril causes a decrease in clearance rate at 20 minutes in patients with renovascular hypertension but not in patients without renovascular hypertension. We conclude that the captopril test can be used to screen for renovascular hypertension, but catopril may impair the renovascular hypertensive patient's renal function.", 
    "295": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of antihypertensive agents on blood pressure and the development of glomerular changes in salt-loaded, 5/6 nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Thirty-two spontaneously hypertensive rats with 5/6 nephrectomy were divided into 4 groups: a control group (N = 8), and group treated with 10 mg/kg/day trichlormethiazide. (N = 8), 30 mg/kg/day captopril (N = 8), and 200 mg/kg/day nicardipine (N = 8). Each of these antihypertensive drugs was added to the drinking water for 10 weeks and the rats were given the drugs and a high-salt diet (5% NaCl). During the experiment, body weight and systolic blood pressure were measured every 2 weeks. At the end of the study, blood was collected for determination of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum protein, serum sodium and potassium, and plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. Also renal tissues were obtained for light and electron microscopic examination at the end of the study. Systolic blood pressure in 5/6 nephrectomized SHR loaded with a high salt was significantly reduced by administration of trichlormethiazide (155 +/- 12 versus 204 +/- 12 mm Hg), but not by administration of either captopril or nicardipine. However, levels of serum creatinine were not significantly elevated in rats treated with captopril and nicardipine (control: 0.93 +/- 0.11 mg/dl, captopril: 0.62 +/- 0.01 mg/dl, nicardipine: 0.55 +/- 0.05 mg/dl). In contrast to changes in blood pressure, marked glomerular sclerosis with hyalinosis, which was found in the control group was not ameliorated by treatment with trichlormethiazide. However, these changes were not observed in rats treated with either captopril or nicardipine in spite of the absence of a prominent fall in blood pressure. These data suggest that captopril and nicardipine ameliorated glomerular injury regardless of the level of systolic blood pressure through the direct and/or indirect actions on the glomerulus.", 
    "296": "Prolonged treatment with cyclosporine (CS) results in an irreversible renal lesion consisting of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, as well as prominent hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). Ischemia to the tubulointerstitial compartment caused by intense CS-mediated renal vasoconstriction may contribute significantly to the development of this lesion. To explore the potential role of volume contraction and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the genesis of this lesion, we have employed a recently described rodent model of chronic cyclosporine nephropathy (CCN). Over 28 days of CS therapy, animals received plain drinking water, 1% saline, or enalapril (ENAL), 50 mg/l in drinking water. At the end of 28 days, Na+ balance in saline-treated animals was markedly positive, and plasma volume was increased; however, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not change, and the tubulointerstitial lesion and JGA hyperplasia as evaluated by morphometric techniques were unaffected. Enalapril-treated animals were relatively hypotensive with lower GFR than CS controls. Enalapril conferred no protection against the development of tubulointerstitial disease and exacerbated the development of JGA hyperplasia and hyperkalemia. We conclude that volume contraction is not an important contributor to the reduced GFR, tubulointerstitial lesion, or JGA hyperplasia associated with long-term CS treatment. Blockade of the RAS also conferred no protection against the development of tubulointerstitial disease but resulted in worsening of JGA hyperplasia and hyperkalemia.", 
    "297": "Endothelin was infused for 20 min into the left renal artery of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs at 1 (n = 6) and 10 (n = 5) ng.min-1.kg-1. Renal blood flow (flow probe) increased 6 +/- 2 (SE) and 29 +/- 2% during the first 5 min of endothelin infusion and then slowly decreased to 86 +/- 3 and 29 +/- 2% of control at 20 min, respectively; the low renal blood flow persisted for at least 30 min after endothelin infusion, and there were no systemic effects of the peptide at either dose. These effects of endothelin on renal function were not altered by the angiotensin (ANG) II receptor antagonist, [Sar1,Thr8]ANG II. In the rat, endothelin was infused intravenously into three groups of pentobarbital-anesthetized females for 30 min at 0.1 microgram.min-1.kg-1; five had endothelin only, six had either endothelin + [Sar1,Thr8]ANG II (n = 4, 1.0 micrograms.min-1.kg-1) or endothelin + saralasin (n = 2, 1 and 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), and five had endothelin + captopril (5 mg.h-1.kg-1). The inhibitors were infused throughout the entire experiment. During infusion of endothelin alone mean arterial blood pressure increased from 106 +/- 2 to 136 +/- 4 mmHg and the glomerular filtration rate decreased from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 0.7 +/- 0.3 ml/min. Captopril attenuated the endothelin-induced changes in renal function but not the increase in mean arterial blood pressure, whereas the competitive ANG II receptor antagonists had no effect on either the systemic or renal actions of the peptide. These data demonstrate that endothelin is a potent renal vasoconstrictor with transient vasodilator effects and that the inhibition of kinin degradation may attenuate the renal actions of the peptide.", 
    "298": "Since the early 1980s, an intensive effort has been focused on the development of orally effective and long-acting inhibitors of renin. During this time, in vitro potency has increased greatly, with several transition-state inhibitor designs yielding inhibitors with subnanomolar IC50 values. In the meantime, both the molecular weight and peptide character of the inhibitors has decreased as important binding elements have been focused into smaller and more stable structures. The resulting inhibitors have shown promising activities in several in vivo models and (in two cases) in man. Nevertheless, renin inhibitors reported to date have limited oral bioavailability and short duration of action, and improvements in both will be necessary for them to compete effectively with ACE inhibitors. Renin inhibitors which have entered clinical studies have at least one naturally occurring amino acid and three or more amide bonds. It is reasonable to expect that continued development will produce wholly nonpeptide inhibitors with still lower MW, and it may be these \"second-generation\" inhibitors which will succeed as therapeutic agents. Development of orally effective and long-acting inhibitors of renin will enable their long-term antihypertensive efficacy and possible advantages over ACE inhibitor to be investigated.", 
    "299": "In systemic sclerosis, abnormalities of myocardial perfusion are common and may be caused by a disturbance of the coronary microcirculation. We evaluated the long-term effect of captopril (75 to 150 mg per day) on thallium 201 myocardial perfusion in 12 normotensive patients with systemic sclerosis. Captopril significantly decreased the mean (+/- SD) number of segments with thallium 201 myocardial perfusion defects (6.5 +/- 1.9 at baseline and 4.4 +/- 2.7 after 1 year of treatment with captopril; p less than 0.02) and increased the mean global thallium score (9.6 +/- 1.7 at baseline and 11.4 +/- 2.1 after captopril; p less than 0.05). In a control group of eight normotensive patients with systemic sclerosis who did not receive captopril, no significant modification in thallium results occurred. Side effects with captopril included hypotension (six patients), taste disturbances (one patient), and skin rash (one patient). These side effects subsided when the dosage was reduced. These findings demonstrate that captopril improves thallium 201 myocardial perfusion in patients with systemic sclerosis and may therefore have a beneficial effect on scleroderma myocardial disease.", 
    "300": "The role of the brain kallikrein-kinin system in the regulation of arterial blood pressure of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats was evaluated. Intracerebroventricular administration of the kinin antagonist [DArg0]Hyp3-Thi5,8[DPhe7]bradykinin caused no change in mean blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto, Sprague-Dawley, or spontaneously hypertensive rats. The antagonist proved to be very potent in blocking the pressor effect of intracerebroventricular bradykinin (32 +/- 3 vs. 3 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). It was specific, as the pressor effect induced by other unrelated peptides was similar during the infusion of either vehicle or kinin antagonist (angiotensin II, 25 +/- 4 vs. 26 +/- 2 mm Hg; prostaglandin E2, 48 +/- 3 vs. 47 +/- 8 mm Hg; norepinephrine, 17 +/- 2 vs. 18 +/- 2 mm Hg; leucine-enkephaline, 15 +/- 2 vs. 16 +/- 1 mm Hg; neurotensin, 18 +/- 2 vs. 19 +/- 1 mm Hg; substance P, 19 +/- 2 vs. 19 +/- 2 mm Hg). Intracerebroventricular administration of 1 mg captopril, an inhibitor of kininase II (one of the enzymes responsible for kinin degradation), caused no change in mean blood pressure in normotensive rats, whereas it increased mean blood pressure by 44 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This increase in mean blood pressure was blocked and then reversed into a hypotensive effect (22 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) during the infusion of kinin antagonist. Our data suggest that the pressor effect induced by intracerebroventricular captopril is due to a transient elevation in endogenous brain kinin levels, supporting the hypothesis that the brain kallikrein-kinin system plays a role in the central regulation of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "301": "We examined the hypothesis that the positive inotropic effect of angiotensin I (Ang I) may be retained in the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors so that it may have a direct beneficial effect on the heart. Accordingly, isolated perfused hearts (Langendorff preparation) of 300-day-old cardiomyopathic hamsters (a model of spontaneous cardiomyopathy) and age-matched normal hamsters (controls) were infused with Ang I in the presence of captopril; propranolol was added to the perfusing medium to block catecholamine-mediated effects of angiotensins on the heart. Left ventricular developed pressure and the rate of increase in left ventricular developed pressure increased significantly (p less than 0.001) in both the cardiomyopathic and the normal hamster heart despite concomitant reduction in myocardial flow rate favoring a direct inotropic effect of Ang I in both normal and myopathic hearts; these changes were significantly higher by almost threefold in the cardiomyopathic than in the normal hamsters (p less than 0.01) and were blocked by the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II. Comparing dose-left ventricular contractility response curves for Ang I and Ang II, ED50 for responses was identical in both normal and myopathic hearts, whereas peak responses to Ang II were double those to Ang I in normal hearts but were almost identical in the myopathic hearts. Binding of [125I]Ang II in six cardiomyopathic and four normal hamster hearts was of high affinity, but there was no evidence for Ang I-saturable high-affinity binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "302": "A clustering of high levels of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (S-ACE) was found in an Italian family. The elevation affected five subjects, two of whom were completely healthy and free from known causes of S-ACE increase. The values of S-ACE in hyperACEmic subjects exceeded the values found in normal relatives severalfold. HyperACEmia seemed to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Immunogenetic studies were performed, but we did not find a genetic marker for this condition. The S-ACE activity was inhibited in vitro by edetic acid (EDTA) and SQ 14,225 (captopril). The S-ACE activity was also determined after 1:8 dilution and dialysis against saline of sera. From these experiments we deduced that Lieberman's intrinsic ACE inhibitor was lacking in the hyperACEmic sera. In the presence of remarkable S-ACE increase, a congenital elevation of S-ACE should be considered and it would be useful to perform a familial investigation.",

These 1-carboxy-omega-(4-piperidyl)alkyl derivatives possess greater or equivalent in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy than captopril and enalapril. The length (n) of the carbon chain in the omega-(4-piperidyl)alkyl moiety was varied from two to six to investigate the optimal structure for long-acting ACE inhibitors. 1-[N-[1(S)-Carboxy-6-(4- piperidyl)hexyl]-L-alanyl]-(2a,3a beta, 7a beta)-octahydro- 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (9b), the most potent member of the series, had an in vivo area under the curve (AUC) of 685, which was calculated by the inhibition of angiotensin I-induced pressor response vs. time curves (0 to 8 h) after p.o. administration.", 
    "304": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the renin inhibitor CP-71362 (Pfizer Central Research, Groton, Connecticut, USA) is capable of inducing sustained reductions in arterial pressure in sodium-depleted dogs and to examine the changes in renal function associated with chronic renin inhibition. In addition, we also examined the chronic effects on renal function and blood pressure of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat. Infusion of CP-71362 (1.1 micrograms/kg per min, intravenously) for 7 days decreased mean arterial pressure from 87 +/- 3 to 75 +/- 2 mmHg, while causing no significant changes in sodium excretion, the glomerular filtration rate, or effective renal plasma flow. Plasma renin activity was suppressed to undetectable levels throughout the 7 days of CP-71362 infusion. Infusion of enalaprilat (4 mg/kg per day) for 7 days in sodium-depleted dogs decreased mean arterial pressure (from 85 +/- 2 to 64 +/- 3 mmHg) and renal vascular resistance, and increased effective renal plasma flow and sodium excretion, but caused no significant changes in the glomerular filtration rate. Thus CP-71362 is a potent inhibitor of dog plasma renin, and we observed no waning of this inhibitory effect of CP-71362's hypotensive actions over 7 days. The mechanisms responsible for the differences in the blood pressure and renal responses to CP-71362 and ACE inhibition are not clear, but may be dose-related or due to differences in the distribution of these compounds to various tissues, including the kidney.", 
    "305": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of oral enalapril (20 mg), in absence and in presence of probenecid pretreatment (1 g twice daily for 5 days), were investigated in 12 healthy volunteers on normal salt intake (150 mmol/24 hr). Mean peak serum concentration of enalapril rose from 158 +/- 7 to 216 +/- 1 ng/ml (P less than .01), whereas that of its metabolite, enalaprilat, rose from 62 +/- 6 to 84 +/- 8 ng/ml (P less than .01) in the presence of probenecid pretreatment. Area under the curve of both enalapril and enalaprilat increased by 50% (P less than .001), which was accompanied by a reduction in renal excretion of both compounds. The renal clearance of enalapril decreased from 229 +/- 19 to 61 +/- 4 ml/min (P less than .001) and that of enalaprilat from 108 +/- 4 to 66 +/- 2 ml/min (P less than .001). The total drug recovery fell from 48 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 2% (P less than .01) of the administered dose with no accompanying changes in plasma elimination half-lives of the parent drug or metabolite. The pharmacodynamic response of enalapril such as fractional excretions of sodium, calcium, magnesium and urate were enhanced by probenecid pretreatment. Absolute urinary excretion of sodium increased from 51 +/- 5 to 91 +/- 8 mmol/6 hr (P less than .001) after enalapril and from 55 +/- 4 to 113 +/- 13 mmol/6 hr (P less than .01) after enalapril in presence of probenecid pretreatment, despite a significant decrease in the renal excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat over the same interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "306": "The effect of rapid converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) with intravenous enalaprilat on technetium-99m-(99mTc) diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renograms was evaluated in rats with two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertension. Rapid sequential DTPA renograms, performed immediately before and five minutes after enalaprilat injection (30 micrograms/kg), demonstrated a selective decrease in clipped kidney DTPA plasma clearance following CEI and no significant effect on unclipped kidney function. Pre- and post-CEI data were obtained with a single injection of DMSA by administering enalaprilat five minutes after the radiopharmaceutical. Enalaprilat slowed the rate of DMSA accumulation in clipped relative to unclipped kidneys, and reduced the clipped/unclipped kidney ratio of absolute DMSA uptake at 10 and 30 min. DTPA and DMSA were equally effective in demonstrating the CEI effect. Enalaprilat was also compared with captopril (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), using sequential DTPA renograms. Clipped kidney DTPA plasma clearance was reduced to an identical degree (40%) by both converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical renographic protocols can probably be devised to take advantage of the rapid, reliable CEI of enalaprilat, thereby shortening total procedure time.", 
    "307": "Left ventricular dilation and remodelling occur in 35-40% of anterior transmural myocardial infarcts and these events are important antecedents to the development of late congestive heart failure. This process commences within the first 24 hours following myocardial infarction and may be steadily progressive over months to years. Both the infarcted and the uninfarcted regions of myocardium are equally involved in the process. Thinning of the left ventricular wall occurs mainly as a result of cell slippage. In addition, compensatory hypertrophy occurs in the uninfarcted segment of the myocardium. While this hypertrophy may initially be physiological, it ultimately appears to become a pathological process and thereby contributes to pump dysfunction. At the present time there are encouraging data to suggest that nitroglycerin, administered in the setting of the acute infarction, or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, may ameliorate this process. Whether a patent infarct related artery further limits dilation is uncertain and is currently under investigation.", 
    "308": "Reduced preload and afterload to the heart are important effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of congestive heart failure. However, since angiotensin II (Ang II) directly increases the strength of myocardial contraction, suppression of Ang II formation by ACE inhibitors could potentially reduce the beneficial effects of Ang II on the failing heart. To study how ACE inhibition suppresses cardiac Ang II formation in man, we characterized ACE-dependent and ACE-independent Ang II-forming pathways in eight normal and 24 failing human hearts obtained at cardiac transplantation. Ang II-forming activity in left ventricular (LV) membrane preparations was assessed by measuring the conversion of [125I]angiotensin I (Ang I) to [125I]Ang II. LV [125I]Ang II-forming activity in normal hearts (35.5 +/- 2.7 fmol/min/mg, n = 8) was not different from that in hearts from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (25.5 +/- 2.9 fmol/min/mg, n = 9) and was 48% lower (p less than 0.001) in hearts from patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (18.5 +/- 1.9 fmol/min/mg, n = 15).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "309": "Vasopressin, the renin-angiotensin system and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) interact in regulating blood pressure. While the vasoconstrictor effect of vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin system is well documented, the direct vascular effect of ANF is unclear. We studied in anaesthetized dogs the coronary vascular effects of agonists and antagonists of vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin system under control and ischaemic conditions, respectively. In addition, the action of ANF and its relationship to the renin-angiotensin system was analysed. A coronary artery was cannulated and perfused by a bypass system from the femoral arteries of the same animal. Coronary vasoconstriction by vasopressin was potentiated when myocardial ischaemia was induced by lowering coronary perfusion pressure while coronary constriction by angiotension I and II was mitigated. A vasopressin receptor blocker slightly reduced coronary blood flow at high doses (intrinsic activity) while the angiotensin II receptor blocker increased coronary flow in myocardial ischaemia. ANF effects were ambiguous at lower doses (1 ng (kg)-1 i.c.) with coronary constriction in 79% of dogs. At higher doses (1 microgram kg-1) ANF consistently induced coronary dilation. The angiotensin II receptor blocker saralasin significantly reduced this coronary dilator effect of ANF. Thus, in conclusion, a vasoconstrictor effect of endogenous vasopressin could not be shown by this study. In contrast, endogenous angiotensin II might participate in control of coronary blood flow during myocardial ischaemia. The coronary dilator effect of ANF at least in part appears to be due to interference with the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "310": "Progressive asymptomatic ventricular dilatation can occur following myocardial infarction and severe ventricular dysfunction is often present by the time clinical congestive heart failure occurs. In a randomized, double-blind trial, the effects of captopril 25 mg tid, frusemide 40 mg daily and placebo were studied in 90 patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 45%) 1 week following Q wave myocardial infarction. Left ventricular volumes and function were assessed at intervals during the subsequent year using two-dimensional echocardiography. The frusemide and placebo groups showed significant increases in ventricular volumes with stroke volume index unchanged and ejection fraction slightly reduced, whereas the captopril group showed a significant reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume index with stroke volume index and ejection fraction increased. At 12 months the difference in the change in ejection fraction from baseline between the captopril and frusemide groups was 10.5% and captopril and placebo groups 9.6% (both P less than 0.0001). There was a significant difference in occurrence of clinical heart failure in the placebo group compared with the other groups (P less than 0.05). Blood pressure increased significantly within the normal range in the placebo and frusemide groups whereas there was essentially no change from baseline in the captopril group. There was no significant correlation between baseline left ventricular volumes and function and subsequent change, and anterior and inferior infarct subgroups showed similar responses within the treatment groups. In conclusion, captopril improves asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction and prevents clinical heart failure during the year following myocardial infarction. Frusemide may also prevent clinical heart failure but not progressive ventricular dilatation.", 
    "311": "The antihypertensive and metabolic effects of the new long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril (Hoe 498), were assessed in 21 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) over a 12-week treatment period. In an average dose of 5 mg given once daily, ramipril effectively reduced the elevated blood pressure. In 74% of the cases systolic and diastolic blood pressure was normalised during monotherapy. Mean blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAI) values showed a slight but significant (p less than 0.05) decrease at the end of the ramipril treatment period (glucose: 8.5 +/- 1.4 mmol/l vs 8.0 +/- 0.9 mmol/l; HbAI: 10.0 +/- 1.3% vs 9.7 +/- 1.1%). C-peptide levels did not change. Since there was also a small reduction of body weight during treatment, the observed hypoglycemic response could not be fully ascribed to ramipril. Also, a reduction in total cholesterol and an increase of HDL cholesterol could be documented during treatment with ramipril. The reduction in body weight could also be made partly responsible for this positive effect on lipid metabolism. No serious side effects were reported during the entire study period. Due to these beneficial effects, ramipril can be recommended as first-line drug in the management of hypertensive subjects with NIDDM.", 
    "312": "The diabetogenic agent streptozotocin (STZ) was injected intraperitoneally in Long-Evans and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficient Brattleboro rats. Twenty-eight days later both strains had a bradycardia and systolic hypotension; STZ-treated Brattleboro rats also had diastolic hypotension. The vasopressin (V1-receptor) antagonist, d(CH2)5[Tyr(Et)]DAVP, had no effect on resting blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) in either strain of rat, indicating the relative maintenance of diastolic BP in STZ-treated Long-Evans rats was not dependent on acute vascular actions of AVP. Captopril caused a modest hypotension in all groups of rats, indicating that BP was not differentially dependent on the renin-angiotensin system in the different groups. In the presence of captopril and the ganglion blocker, pentolinium tartrate, the AVP-mediated recovery in BP was impaired in STZ-treated Long-Evans rats. During administration of d(CH2)5[Tyr(Et)]DAVP and pentolinium, the angiotensin II (ANG II)-mediated BP recovery was smaller in both groups of STZ-treated rats, indicating that this abnormality was not likely to be caused by inhibition of renin release by AVP. The abnormalities in ANG II- and AVP-mediated recovery were prevented by insulin treatment.", 
    "313": "There is evidence to suggest that thromboxane synthesis inhibition will attenuate the hypertension and proteinuria associated with subtotal renal ablation. In the present study, the thromboxane receptor antagonist, daltroban, (30 mg/kg/day i.p.) or vehicle was administered to rats for 3 weeks starting 2 weeks after partial renal ablation (right uninephrectomy and ligation of approximately two-thirds of the blood supply to the left kidney). Renal ablation was associated with proteinuria and increased systolic blood pressure. Neither the proteinuria nor the hypertension was affected by daltroban administration. Histological examination of the remaining kidney demonstrated no beneficial effect of daltroban. In a second study, it was determined that, 2 weeks after renal ablation, urinary thromboxane excretion was significantly increased, and subsequent administration of daltroban for 2 weeks resulted in significant blockade of the effects of the thromboxane mimetic, U46619. In a third study, enalapril (50 mg/l in the drinking water) resulted in a significant attenuation of the proteinuria, hypertension and glomerular lesions associated with partial renal ablation. The data indicate that enalapril, but not daltroban, protects against the development of renal disease associated with reduced renal mass.", 
    "314": "In an attempt to identify which parameters predict survival in advanced dilated cardiomyopathy, 232 patients presenting for assessment for cardiac transplantation were investigated and followed for 10 +/- 12 months (range 2 weeks to 5 years). Etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy included ischemic heart disease (33%), idiopathic (42%) and miscellaneous (25%). In each patient, 26 parameters were recorded. Whole group survival was 68% at 1 year, 56% at 2 years, 41% at 3 years and 25% at 4 years. On Cox multivariate regression analysis, 3 parameters predicted survival: New York Heart Association symptom class (p less than 0.0001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p less than 0.008) and plasma atrial natriuretic factor level (p less than 0.002). On paired testing of actuarial survival curves, plasma noradrenaline also held predictive value (p less than 0.002), as did left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 20% on radionuclide ventriculography (p = 0.007) and presence of greater than or equal to 4 beats of ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring (p = 0.007). Treatment with amiodarone did not appear to influence survival. Conventional determinants of prognosis in cardiomyopathy (symptom class, wedge pressure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and ejection fraction) do not alone always adequately differentiate survival in this group of high risk patients. More attention to plasma noradrenaline and to atrial natriuretic factor levels may give important additional information in the context of assessment of patients for transplantation.", 
    "315": "Coronary vasomotion plays an important role in the regulation of coronary perfusion at rest and during exercise. Normal coronary arteries show coronary vasodilation of the proximal (+20%) and distal (+40%) vessel segments during supine bicycle exercise. However, patients with coronary artery disease show exercise-induced vasoconstriction of the stenotic vessel segments. The exact mechanism of exercise-induced stenosis narrowing is not clear but might be related to a passive collapse of the disease-free vessel wall (Venturi mechanism), elevated plasma levels of circulating catecholamines, an insufficient production of the endothelium-derived vasorelaxing factor or increased platelet aggregation due to turbulent blood flow with release of thromboxane A2 and serotonin. Various vasoactive drugs, such as nitroglycerin and calcium antagonists, prevent exercise-induced stenosis vasoconstriction. An additive effect on coronary vasodilation of the stenotic vessel segment was observed after combination of nitroglycerin with diltiazem. Thus, exercise-induced stenosis narrowing plays an important role in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischaemia during dynamic exercise. The antianginal effect of vasoactive substances can be explained--besides the effect on pre- and afterload--by a direct action on coronary stenosis vasomotion.", 
    "316": "Forty-eight hypertensive patients affected by various levels of renal failure entered this open, non controlled study, lasting 12 weeks. Patients were divided into two groups according to baseline creatinine clearance: Group I (29 patients): creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 25 ml/min but less than 45 ml/min; Group II (19 patients): creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 10 ml/min but less than 25 ml/min. Patients in Group I started with enalapril 5 mg q.d. and patients in Group II with enalapril 2.5 mg q.d. Enalapril could be titrated up to 20 mg/day. At the end of the study in both groups of patients blood pressure normalization was reached in a high percentage of patients without any significant change in renal function parameters. Plasma potassium showed a significant increase during the study but no patient discontinued treatment due to hyperkaliemia. In conclusion this study shows antihypertensive therapy with enalapril during chronic renal insufficiency to be effective at low dosage (5-10 mg) in lowering blood pressure and to have a good safety profile.", 
    "317": "NIDDM and hypertension are both characterized by insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia. In IDDM, factors associated with nephropathy produce hypertension. To avoid exacerbation of the metabolic condition, and to prevent further deterioration in glycemic control, treatment of hypertension in the diabetic patient should include the administration of medication with the fewest adverse effects on glucose homeostasis. If diuretics are to be used, it appears that loop diuretics may be preferable to the thiazides or potassium-sparing compounds. Among the remaining classes of antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors may be the agents of choice because of their potential positive effects on insulin sensitivity and renal function, and their lack of severe adverse side-effects.", 
    "318": "ACE inhibition may be useful in several manifestations of ischaemic heart disease, such as heart failure due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Recent evidence suggests that these effects may also be present in normotensive patients with ischaemic heart disease without heart failure. Theoretically, converting-enzyme inhibition, through coronary and systemic vasodilating effects and negative inotropic properties, should have a favourable effect on the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio and, hence, affect the incidence and severity of myocardial ischaemia. It is doubtful, however, whether these cardiac and extracardiac properties of ACE inhibitors really underlie its potential antiischaemic effects, at least in the average patient with ischaemic heart disease without concomitant heart failure and hypertension. Recent animal and human studies indicate that converting-enzyme inhibitors may modulate myocardial ischaemia by reducing ischaemia-induced circulating neurohumoral activation. It has been shown that, depending on the severity of ischaemia, the circulating renin-angiotensin system may become activated together with an increase in circulating catecholamine levels. ACE inhibition suppresses this neuroendocrine stimulation during ischaemia and modulates subsequent systemic and, presumably, also coronary vasoconstriction. In addition to these effects on circulating neurohormones, ACE inhibition could affect myocardial ischaemia through a number of local actions, e.g. modulation of tissue (cardiac) angiotensin II formation and bradykinin breakdown, stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis and, in the use of sulphydryl compounds, by affecting EDRF formation. Whether ACE inhibitors have clear antiischaemic effects in all clinical conditions is uncertain. Their efficacy to limit exercise-induced ischaemia has been questioned. In contrast, pacing-induced ischaemia in patients at rest is clearly prevented by ACE inhibition. This differential effect may be related to a more pronounced difference in circulating neurohormones during exercise per se. It also suggests that ACE inhibitors may be particularly useful as (additional) antiischaemic therapy in patients with angina at rest, e.g. unstable angina and the acute phase of myocardial infarction.", 
    "319": "Xamoterol ('Corwin', 'Carwin', 'Corwil', 'Xamtol', ICI118, 587)*, a partial beta-agonist, has beneficial effects in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. In acute haemodynamic studies in more severe heart failure some patients have shown negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, although treatment with a partial agonist should protect the heart against excessive stimulation, while providing a baseline level of sympathetic drive. This study examined the effects of oral xamoterol in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Ten patients were studied, nine with ischaemic heart disease. All but one were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class III. Other treatment, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, was continued. The patients underwent a standard bicycle exercise test, and the following day cardiac catheterization was performed to obtain measurements of ventricular size (by cineangiography) and pressures during the cardiac cycle. The patients began treatment with xamoterol 200 mg b.d. in addition to their baseline therapy, and this was continued for an average of 9 weeks, after which the exercise test and the haemodynamic investigations were repeated. At baseline, all patients had a raised left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and nine had a low election fraction, raised end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices and reduced left ventricular (+) dP/dtmax Xamoterol produced a marked reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, a fall in end-systolic volume index and improvements in T1, (+) dP/dtmax and (dP/dt)/DP40 with no change in mean aortic pressure. Duration of exercise increased in four patients, and did not change in the other four tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "320": "Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were daily treated for 2 weeks with perindopril [an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor] and nitrendipine (a calcium antagonist) alone or in combination. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and diuresis were assessed weekly in conscious rats, and systemic and regional hemodynamics were investigated by the microsphere technique at the end of the treatment in anesthetized rats. Both perindopril (2 mg.kg-1.d-1) and nitrendipine (10 mg.kg-1.d-1) decreased BP to the same extent, but perindopril exerted a longer action. The hemodynamic profile of each drug was respectively consistent with the classic ones of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists already described in the literature. With combination of the two treatments, effects were at least additive, except that the nitrendipine-induced tachycardia was partially reduced by perindopril. BP reduction was additive, and significant potentiation was shown at the systemic [cardiac index (CI) increase, total peripheral resistance (TPR) decrease] and some regional (hepatic, muscular, and cutaneous vasodilations) levels. These results, which are in agreement with the different mechanisms of action of the two drugs, emphasize the advantage of combining perindopril with nitrendipine for treatment of hypertension.", 
    "321": "The hypotensive effects of three different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril) and two angiotensin II (AII) analogues ([Sar1Ile5Ala8]AII and [Sar1Ile5Thr8]AII) were compared in conscious, freely-moving Brattleboro rats after 14 h of water deprivation. There was no difference between the hypotensive effects of the three ACE inhibitors. Neither was there any difference between the hypotensive effects of the two AII antagonists, although when administered following ACE inhibition, [Sar1Ile5Thr8]AII caused a transient pressor effect that was significantly less than that caused by [Sar1Ile5Ala8]AII. ACE inhibition caused a greater fall in blood pressure (BP) than AII antagonism and caused an additional fall in BP during AII antagonism. These results indicate an additional hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors, over that of AII antagonists, that is not readily accounted for in terms of nonspecific effects of the former or agonistic properties of the latter.", 
    "322": "The therapeutic potential of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was assessed in an ovine model of heart failure induced by rapid left ventricular (LV) pacing and compared with the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Hemodynamic, hormonal, and metabolic measurements were studied during three 5-day periods of LV pacing. No treatment (control) or a continuous ANP infusion (25 ng/kg/min) was given in random order during the first two periods, while ACE inhibitor was always given during the third period. Baseline measurements immediately prior to the start of each pacing phase showed no significant variation. Significant neurohumoral activation and hemodynamic responses were observed in each pacing phase. During ANP infusion, plasma ANP levels were 3-5-fold higher than those observed in the control or ACE inhibition treatment phases. Compared with control, a natriuresis was observed on the first day, whereas glomerular filtration rate (GFR) tended to be maintained during ANP infusion. The rise in left atrial pressure and plasma aldosterone tended to be blunted. When the two treatment phases were compared, the rise in left atrial pressure during LV pacing was less with ACE inhibition, whereas there was a similar reduction in sodium retention after the initial natriuresis with ANP. By contrast, GFR tended to be maintained better during ANP infusion compared to ACE inhibition. These results suggest that ANP, or a similar \"enhancing\" analogue, may be useful in the treatment of heart failure, especially if administered early in the development of the disorder.", 
    "323": "The acute systemic and regional hemodynamic responses to a single oral dose (4 mg) of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril were investigated in 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Perindopril produced significant and long-lasting decreases in systemic vascular resistance (-18%), right atrial pressure (-60%), and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-28%), whereas it significantly increased cardiac index (+ 12%). Brachial (+ 130%, pulsed Doppler technique) and renal (+ 34%) blood flows were also significantly increased whereas hepatic blood flow remained unchanged. Brachial flow/cardiac output and renal flow/cardiac output ratios increased significantly from 0.8 to 1.6 and from 13.2 to 16.5, respectively. The maximal decreases in forearm and renal (but not in systemic) vascular resistances were correlated with the basal plasma norepinephrine concentrations but not plasma epinephrine concentrations or plasma renin activity. We conclude that in severe heart failure (a) perindopril considerably improves systemic hemodynamics and exerts an inhomogeneous vasodilating effect, resulting in a redistribution of flows toward the forearm and renal territories, (b) norepinephrine is a major determinant of the arteriolar tone in these two vascular beds, and (c) the pulsed Doppler is a particularly suitable method to non-invasively detect and assess hemodynamic improvements in heart failure patients.", 
    "324": "ACE-inhibitors have been shown to have considerable therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of heart failure and to be able to significantly prolong the survival of treated patients. The benefits of these drugs when used in the treatment of heart failure are due to their vasodilator action on both arterial and venous vessels. An even more relevant mechanism might be the modulation of some neuro-endocrine responses induced by heart failure, such as angiotensin-aldosterone production, which are sometimes excessive or harmful. The molecules presently available in Italy are four (captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, quinapril), endowed with considerably different pharmacological characteristics, but substantially similar as far as effectiveness and tolerability are concerned. Although general guidelines cannot be suggested on the basis of the pharmacological profile alone, the choice of the drug to be used in every single patient with heart failure should be made taking into account the adequacy of the pharmacological properties for the specific situation.", 
    "325": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II, EC 3.4.15.1) was visualized in unfixed rat brain sections by autoradiography after incubation with a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit lung converting-enzyme antibody and [125I]protein A. Paraformaldehyde fixation interfered with the recognition of ACE by its antibody in brain nuclei but not in the choroid plexus. Conversely, incubation of brain sections with the specific ACE inhibitor [125I]351A allowed ACE visualization in either unfixed and paraformaldehyde-fixed brain sections, since [125I]351A binding was not affected by our fixation conditions. Our results indicate that ACE could be visualized in unfixed brain sections directly by incubation with the specific inhibitor [125I]351A or indirectly by radioimmunohistochemistry and autoradiography. Different autoradiographic methods could be used to visualize and quantify ACE in unfixed or fixed tissues.", 
    "326": "The effects of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and bradykinin (BK) on prostacyclin (PGI2) production in isolated arterial tissue were investigated. Rings of rat abdominal aorta were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and PGI2 generation was assessed by the determination of its stable hydrolysis product; 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The addition of both ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril, and bradykinin resulted in dose-dependent stimulation of PGI2 biosynthesis when the individual substance was added into the incubation buffer at final concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-5) M. The bradykinin-induced stimulation of PGI2 synthesis was dose dependently inhibited by the BK receptor antagonist, D-Arg[Hyp3, Thi5,8, D-Phe7]BK. The captopril- and lisinopril-induced stimulation of vascular 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production was also significantly decreased when the BK antagonist was added to the incubation medium together with the ACE inhibitors. Our results show that both captopril and lisinopril stimulate PGI2 synthesis in arterial tissue and that this effect may be secondary to changes in the activity of the kinin system.", 
    "327": "The treatment of high blood pressure in black people is often complicated by a variety of factors. These include the tendency of black hypertensive patients to have three to five times the cardiovascular mortality of white hypertensive patients, black hypertensives' more frequent progression to end-organ damage and stroke, and socioeconomic conditions that impede access to proper health care. In addition, blacks have a unique hemodynamic profile, one that alters the efficacy of many antihypertensive drugs. In black hypertensives, for example, diuretics are more effective than they are in whites, whereas beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are less effective. Although it is true that blacks are disproportionately represented in the hypertensive population--having up to seven times the prevalence of severe hypertension seen in whites--it is not true that they are relatively unresponsive to drug therapy. A number of long-term clinical trials have established that black hypertensives respond well to treatment. Specifically, blacks in stepped-care therapy achieve goal blood pressure at the same rate as their white counterparts, although the increased barriers to blood pressure control in blacks require practitioners to put increased effort into this therapy. Possibly because black hypertensives tend to have low plasma renin levels, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not nearly as effective as diuretics when used as monotherapy. Diuretics, on the other hand, have established efficacy in blacks, and their selection for initial monotherapy is favored for two additional reasons. First, they present a better profile in terms of overall cost and compliance, thanks to their lower relative cost and once-a-day dosing. Second, when diuretics are combined with another antihypertensive therapy, such as an ACE inhibitor or a calcium-entry blocker, responsiveness may be further improved. This combination therapy may be especially important in black hypertensives, who exhibit a higher incidence of concurrent diseases such as left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure.", 
    "328": "The diagnosis of atheromatous stenosis of the renal arteries has been greatly facilitated by the advances achieved in medical imaging: intravenous digital angiography, in particular, enables the renal arteries to be visualized in patients with progressive hypertension refractory to treatment and associated with renal impairment or symptomatic atheroma. However, the diagnosis of hypertension with renal stenosis is not synonymous with renovascular hypertension, the latter term being reserved to a disease that can be cured by a causal treatment. The diagnosis of imputation, inspired by experimental models, rests on exploration of the renal endocrine and excretory function upstream of the stenosis before and after blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme enzyme inhibitors. The exploration is made by urography, measurements of renin concentrations in the two renal veins and radioisotope scanning. The decision to operate or not is taken after comparing these renal data with such vascular data as influence of hypertension on the target organs and diffusion of the atheromatous disease to other territories. Treatment may be purely medical, but in most cases it includes a revascularization procedure, starting with transluminal dilatation: surgical revascularization is used only in difficult cases, in complete arterial obliteration and in failures of dilatation. Revascularization is not indicated when the stenosis has no systemic or local functional repercussions before or after blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "329": "In 28 patients with chronic angina pectoris grade II-III (NYHA) the authors investigated the antianginous effect of captopril. All patients had a normal blood pressure and the diagnosis was confirmed by coronary angiography. The investigation was made in three sub-groups as a simple crossover experiment with a randomized onset. In 10 patients without dysfunction (group A) and eight with severe left ventricular dysfunction (group C) a short-term comparative study of captopril and placebo was made; 10 patients of group B took first for 7 days diltiazem, 3 X 60 mg, and then during subsequent weeks the action of diltiazem with placebo was compared and the action of diltiazem combined with captopril 3 X 25 mg per day. Captopril significantly reduced the blood pressure and Robinson's index at rest and during activity. It protracted significantly the time before the development of stenocardia in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and in the group treated with diltiazem where it reduced even further the incidence of stenocardias. ACE inhibitors may apparently enhance the effectiveness of diltiazem in normotensive patients with angina pectoris and it may be assumed that it will have an even more potent effect in concurrent hypertension or left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "330": "Pharmacological evidence indicates that angiotensin (Ang II) converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate cardiovascular responses to sympathetic stimulation. To investigate the physiological significance of this attenuation, the pressor and heart rate responses to bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) were studied before and after administration of captopril and again during Ang II replacement in conscious, aortic nerve-sectioned rabbits with chronically implanted carotid occluders. In the control period, BCO produced increases (p less than 0.05) in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of 37.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and 21.7 +/- 5.4 beats/min from baseline values of 79.1 +/- 2.5 mm Hg and 255.4 +/- 16.7 beats/min. Captopril (5 mg/kg i.v.) markedly reduced (p less than 0.05) both the pressor (10.2 +/- 2.6 mm Hg) and HR (5.0 +/- 4.0 beats/min) responses to BCO, in parallel with a decrease in plasma Ang II of 75%. Infusion of a subpressor dose of Ang II (5-25 ng/kg/min i.v.) increased plasma Ang II to precaptopril levels and fully restored (p less than 0.05) the pressor (33.0 +/- 5.7 mm Hg) and HR (19.8 +/- 7.7 beats/min) responses to BCO. In two additional series of experiments, the mechanism of the effects of captopril and Ang II were investigated. In the first series, cardiac baroreflex curves (pulse interval versus MAP) were generated by increasing or decreasing blood pressure with phenylephrine or nitroprusside (5-20 micrograms/kg/min i.v.). The slope of the linear region of the curve (2.9 msec/mm Hg) was not changed significantly by captopril treatment (3.1 msec/mm Hg) or Ang II replacement (3.2 msec/mm Hg), indicating that cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was not altered by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. In the second series, the effect of captopril on the pressor response to exogenous norepinephrine (0.1-2.5 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) was tested. The response was reduced by less than 40%, indicating only a modest postsynaptic component to the action of captopril. These results provide physiological evidence for an important action of endogenous Ang II in facilitating the cardiovascular responses to sympathetic stimulation in conscious rabbits. This facilitation is not due to an action upon the baroreflex per se but results, at least in part, from a presynaptic action of Ang II.", 
    "331": "The effects of 9 months of orally administered captopril (25-50 mg/kg body wt/day) on aortic atherosclerosis was examined in normotensive Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. Captopril caused a significant decrease in aortic atherosclerosis. Total aortic surface involvement by lesions was reduced from 48 +/- 3.6% in control Watanabe rabbits to 30 +/- 3.9% with captopril treatment (p less than 0.01). Most of the decrease could be accounted for by a marked reduction in atherosclerosis of descending thoracic aortas from 49 +/- 5.2% to 15 +/- 3.9% in control and captopril-related groups, respectively (p less than 0.001). Significant decrease in cholesterol content of descending thoracic aorta was also observed in captopril-treated rabbits. Microscopic examination of the arterial lesions in captopril-treated animals suggested a relative decrease in cellularity and increase in extracellular matrix as compared with untreated animals. These studies indicate that captopril has a potent antiatherosclerotic action in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit.", 
    "332": "The data on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, a new class of drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as arterial hypertension and heart failure are considered.

    "333": "The study involved 113 patients over age 50 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension, randomly assigned to treatment with enalapril (n = 54) or sustained-release verapamil (n = 59). During an eight-week titration period, doses were adjusted to achieve supine diastolic blood pressures (DBP) below 90 mmHg; patients were then given maintenance doses for eight weeks. Mean blood pressures were reduced significantly from 147.7/93.9 mmHg at baseline to 137.7/84.5 mmHg at the end of the maintenance period in the enalapril group and from 155.1/95.1 to 142.4/86.2 mmHg in the verapamil group. In the patients who completed treatment, the mean daily doses required to maintain DBP below 90 mmHg were 9.6 mg of enalapril and 244.9 mg of verapamil. There were 11 treatment failures in the enalapril group and 22 in the verapamil group: eight of the enalapril and 17 of the verapamil patients did not attain goal blood pressures and three and five were withdrawn because of side effects. It is concluded that both enalapril and sustained-release verapamil were generally effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in the middle-aged and older patients.", 
    "334": "A series of novel L-alanyl- and L-lysyl-L-proline derivatives having an omega-amino-1-carboxyalkyl group was prepared, and assayed for their inhibitory activity against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The dicarboxylic acids possesing S,S,S configuration showed potent in vitro ACE inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.68-1.4 nmol/l. The length of the carbon chain in the omega-aminoalkyl moiety was varied from 6 to 9 to investigate the optimal structure for long-acting ACE inhibitors. The most prolonged activity in vivo was observed with N-[8-amino-1(s)-carboxyoctyl]-L-alanyl-L-proline upon i.v. and p.o.", 
    "335": "Both a myogenic response and the tubuloglomerular feedback control mechanism seem to be involved in autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF). Earlier experiments have shown that clamping of renal arterial perfusion pressure, below the autoregulatory range, reduces single-nephron GFR, and that this low value is maintained during the first 10-15 min after release of the clamp. It was also found that the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism in the early declamp phase was strongly activated to reduce GFR. These findings can not be easily understood with the current knowledge of autoregulation, but would suggest a resetting of RBF and GFR autoregulation to a new level. To test this, left renal arterial perfusion pressure was reduced from 100 to 60 mmHg during 20 min with and without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (0.5 mg i.v. enalapril). Renal blood flow was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry. When arterial perfusion pressure was reduced from 100 to 60 mmHg for 20 min, RBF was reduced to 77% of control and remained at this low level during the first minutes of declamp. In this situation there was an autoregulation to a new level. Renal blood flow was then slowly normalized (16.1 min). In the enalapril-treated animals RBF was only reduced to 85% during the 20 min of clamping and returned immediately to the control level at declamp. Thus, these experiments demonstrate that if renal blood flow is decreased by reducing the perfusion pressure below the normal autoregulatory range the pressure range for blood flow autoregulation resets to a lower level and that this change is mediated via the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "336": "The in vitro effects of cilazaprilat in a concentration range of 10 nM to 1 mM were investigated on various Na+ and K+ transport systems in human red blood cells. Cilazaprilat inhibited the anion carrier or DIDS-sensitive LiCO3(-)-influx and the bumetanide-sensitive K(+)-efflux. However, no effect of cilazaprilat on the Na+, K(+)-pump activity, the number of active Na+ pump units and on the Na+, Li(+)-countertransport activity could be demonstrated. It is suggested that through a decreased anion carrier indicating a decreased Na(+)-influx, the lower intracellular Na+ concentration observed in vivo during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, can be at least partly explained.", 
    "337": "The metabolism and biliary excretion of the diacid angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril have been studied in an isolated perfused rat liver model. Inhibitors were presented to the livers at a dose of 100 micrograms. The hepatic clearance of lisinopril was very low (0.072 ml/min) and was hardly excreted into the bile. The clearances of enalapril, perindopril and ramipril were higher at 0.63, 0.87 and 9.9 ml/min, respectively, and were excreted into bile. The amounts of ester prodrugs excreted in bile were 4.0, 6.1 and 14%, respectively, whereas the diacid forms were excreted to the extent of 46, 27 and 71% of the administered dose, respectively, over 4 hr. Glucuronide metabolites were only detected in bile in significant concentrations for perindopril and ramipril. Base hydrolysis of the perfusate samples showed that lisinopril was not significantly metabolized to conjugates and that little metabolism of enalapril occurred other than rapid conversion to the diacid form. However, both perindopril and ramipril were extensively metabolized beyond the diacid form. These differences in hepatic handling can in part be explained by their octanol-buffer partition coefficients but may also be related to the introduction of a bicyclic ring in perindopril and ramipril which increases their ability to be metabolized and excreted into bile. These differences in hepatic handling of angiotensin-converting enzyme are likely to influence their clinical usefulness, particularly in renal and hepatic disease.", 
    "338": "We evaluated the cardiopulmonary exercise test results before and after long-term (16 weeks) treatment with the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, felodipine (10 mg b.i.d., n = 9), and the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg b.i.d., n = 11), in 20 patients with New York Heart Association class III congestive heart failure. There were no significant differences at baseline. After 16 weeks patients in the enalapril group showed a significant increase in exercise duration and VO2max, without changes in arterial pressures and heart rate. In the felodipine group, exercise duration and VO2max did not change significantly, but arterial pressures and heart rate were significantly reduced at all exercise levels. Between group analysis showed a significant reduction in arterial pressures and heart rate in the felodipine group compared with enalapril, but no differences in aerobic capacity and exercise duration. These results demonstrate that felodipine and enalapril have essentially different effects on cardiopulmonary exercise results in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "339": "Although the optimum substrate for lipoamidase (lipoyl-X hydrolase) has not yet been determined, it is known that lipoamidase activity, as determined by hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate lipoyl 4-aminobenzoate (LPAB), is widely distributed in pig brain tissues, i.e. in the cerebrum, cerebellum and medulla. Over 95% of the enzyme activity is present in the membrane subfractions, indicating that brain lipoamidase is an integral membrane protein enzyme. To elucidate the chemical nature and the optimum substrate of the abundant lipoamidase in the brain, we isolated it from the membrane subfractions. After an 8-step purification procedure, brain lipoamidase was purified 601-fold and identified as a 140 kDa glycoprotein by SDS/PAGE. A mechanistic study to determine Km and Vmax, values was carried out using various synthetic compounds. Lipoyl-lysine, which is generally believed to be a naturally occurring substrate of lipoamidase, was first compared with biotinyl-lysine, because these two vitamins have reactive sulphur atoms and are similar in molecular mass and structure. The Km for lipoyl-lysine was 333 microM, whereas biotinyl-lysine was not hydrolysed. Stringent specificity for the lipoyl moiety is demonstrated, as expected. Dipeptides of amino acid-lysine structures were studied, and dipeptides of aspartyl- and glutamyl-lysine hydrolysis occurred at high Km (3 mM) values. Thus lysine in the moiety is not very effective as an optimum substrate. The chemical bond structures of the amide bond (lipoyl-lysine) and peptide bond (aspartyl-lysine) were hydrolysed. Next, the ester bond compound was tested, and it was observed that lipolylmethyl ester was hydrolysed at high specificity. These findings indicate that this enzyme has broad specificities with respect to bond structure; it therefore is a unique hydrolase having stringent specificity for lipoic acid and relatively broad specificity for the chemical bond and the X moiety. Various inhibitors were tested; a few reagents, such as organic mercurials, di-isopropylfluorophosphate, 1,10-phenanthroline, sodium azide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor exhibited some inhibition (not more than 60%). Thus the active centre of this enzyme is a complex type. Although ATP is not hydrolysed and the lowest Km value is exhibited by the synthetic substrate reduced from LPAB (12 microM), some other compounds may still be expected to be hydrolysed by this unique and abundant brain lipoamidase.", 
    "340": "Since thromboxane (Tx) can mediate the actions of angiotensin II (ANG II), we investigated interaction between these systems on the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response. TGF was assessed from proximal stop-flow pressure (PSF) during orthograde perfusion of the loop of Henle (LH) between 0 and 40 nl/min. In the basal state, TGF was 11.3 +/- 0.8 mmHg. In series 1 experiments, it was unaltered by vehicle (+0.3 +/- 0.9 mmHg, n = 9, NS), was reduced by an ANG II antagonist, saralasin (-2.4 +/- 1.1 mmHg, n = 8, P less than 0.0005), and by a TxA2 antagonist SQ 29,548 (-4.8 +/- 0.6 mmHg, n = 11, P less than 0.0001). Both drugs together produced an additive blunting of TGF of -6.9 +/- 0.7 mmHg. In series 2 experiments, TGF was again unchanged by vehicle (+0.2 +/- 0.6 mmHg). It was reduced by -4.4 +/- 0.2 mmHg (P less than 0.0001) by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor CGS-14,824A (50 mg/kg, n = 5) and by -4.0 +/- 0.4 mmHg (P less than 0.001) by a Tx synthesis inhibitor CGS-13,080 (50 mg/kg, n = 7). Although both drugs together produced a further blunting of the response of -6.1 +/- 0.4 mmHg, this was significantly (P less than 0.001) less than additive. In both series, a response (averaging 3.5 +/- 0.3 mmHg) persisted in all rats given combined antagonists or inhibitors. In conclusion, both ANG II and TxA2 can modulate TGF-induced changes in PSF independently, and the response probably requires other system(s) in addition to ANG II and TxA2.", 
    "341": "Food has been shown to reduce the bioavailability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, but not the bioavailability of inhibitors administered as ester prodrugs. Perindopril is the ester pro-drug of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindoprilat. The influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of perindopril (4 mg administered orally) and the time course of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in serum was studied in a randomized crossover short-term study of 12 healthy subjects. Food significantly decreased the relative availability of perindoprilat by 35% +/- 42%, the fractional urinary excretion of perindoprilat from 19% +/- 7% to 13% +/- 4% (p less than 0.05), and the partial metabolic clearance of perindopril to perindoprilat from 102 +/- 57 ml.min-1 to 72 +/- 32 ml.min-1 (p less than 0.05). These changes were associated with a significant decrease in the area under the percent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition-versus-time curve by 15% (p less than 0.05). Food did not alter the total amount of drug recovered in urine as perindopril and its metabolites, and it did not alter perindoprilat renal clearance. We concluded that food alters the conversion of perindopril to its active metabolite perindoprilat after single-dose administration of perindopril.", 
    "342": "The ability of sulindac to modify the weal response to four doses of intradermal bradykinin in subjects given enalapril was tested in a double-blind cross-over study in normal volunteers. The dose-dependent increase in skin thickness after bradykinin was significantly reduced by prior administration of sulindac. Certain of the actions and adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be due to the interaction of prostaglandins and bradykinin.", 
    "343": "Involvement of the brain renin-angiotensin system in baroreceptor reflex regulation was assessed by recording reflex heart rate and sympathetic nerve responses in normotensive rats that had been infused intracerebroventricularly with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril for 15 days. Reflex bradycardia and sympathetic nerve inhibition during pressor responses to phenylephrine were larger in rats with intracerebroventricularly infused enalapril than in control rats similarly infused either intracerebroventricularly with saline or intravenously with enalapril. In contrast, opposite reflex responses to sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension were mostly unaffected. Because depressor, bradycardic, and sympathoinhibitory responses to electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the left aortic depressor nerve were also enhanced, intracerebroventricularly infused enalapril must be affecting the baroreceptor reflex arc centrally. These results are compatible with the interpretation that intracerebroventricularly infused enalapril enhanced baroreceptor reflex sensitivity by reducing endogenous angiotensin II levels in the brain through converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "344": "A report of three patients who developed angiodema while receiving enalapril. Patient 1 came in with an 8-hour history of facial swelling after enalapril had been started 2 days earlier. The second patient came in with severe angiodema of the tongue, larynx, and glottis requiring emergency tracheostomy, hydroxyzine, and steroids. He had been treated with enalapril for 1 year. The third patient developed facial swelling within a few hours of the first dose of enalapril. Angiodema with enalapril can occur early or late in the course of therapy. A possible mechanism for this drug reaction is the potentiation of bradykinin with resultant kinin system activation.", 
    "345": "Captopril was tested for pharmacokinetics. Its hypotensive effect was compared with plasma renin activity (PRA) and blood captopril levels in single and prolonged administrations of its various doses in 58 hypertensive patients. When a single dose (25 mg) of captopril was given, a relationship was found between its hypotensive effect and higher blood concentration, baseline PRA. The detection rate of its antihypertensive effect was not related to the baseline PRA. The efficient and safe dose of captopril was shown to be 75-150 mg daily, maintaining its blood concentration within ranges of 75-175 ng/ml.", 
    "346": "We compare the effects of two of the main angiotensin convertase enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, aiming to evaluate their effects in the arterial circulation performance, micro-circulation, and changes in regional blood flow, assuming their property of lowering the angiotensin II blood levels, a very strong peripheral vasoconstrictor. We studied 22 patients: all of them with hypertension and/or skin ulcerations, dropping out those who had venous. They were evaluated periodically, clinically and with photoelectric plethysmography of lower extremities. To interpret the traces we designed an ideogram which gathered the plethysmographic behavior before and after the treatment. Nearly 80% showed considerable improvement in pain, functional capacity and plethysmographic traces patterns. healing of the ulcerations was achieved in all case. We propose some hypothesis to explain the good effect that we have observed.", 
    "347": "The effect of single dose (50 mg) Captopril (C) used either alone or associated to diuretics (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide -HCTI) in the treatment of mild-moderate essential arterial hypertension was studied in a multicentric study. Eighty eight patients were chosen. After a minimum of 4 month follow-up period 53.4% responded (BDP less than 95 mm Hg) to single dose C (group 1:47 patients), 89.77% to 50 mg C in single dose together with 50 mg HTIT (group 2: 32 patients), 95.45% of two 50 mg doses of C and 50 mg HCIT (group 3: 5 patients), and 97.72% responded to 3 doses of C and 50 mg of HCTI (group 4: 2 patients). The decrease in blood pressure values was statistically significant (p, 000, Wilcoxon test) in groups 1 and 2, having a mean decrease in blood pressure (BP) of 14%. In group 1 (n = 42) the SBP which initially was 165.72 +/- 11.32, decreased to 148.28 +/- 11.5 and the DBP decreased from 101.55 +/- 5.68 to 87.28 +/- 6.59. In group 2 (n = 32) the SBP decreased from 173.50 +/- 14.08 to 152.44 +/- 20.8 and the DBP from 103.34 +/- 5.29 to 87.47 +/- 6.39. The response to monotherapy could not be statistically correlated either to early essential hypertension or to the patients age. Treatment was discontinued in three cases due to the secondary effects, cough, ageusia and nervousness, showing the remaining patients a good tolerance. No changes were observed in the analytical parameters. This study shows the usefulness and tolerance of single dose C as the initial treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "348": "In a double-blind study, patients with mild essential hypertension were randomly assigned to treatment with transdermal clonidine or oral captopril. After a two- to three-week titration period, blood pressure decreased significantly from 146.3/95.4 to 134.7/85.1 mmHg in the 33 clonidine-treated patients and from 143.0/96.1 to 134.8/87.1 mmHg in the 35 captopril-treated patients; the mean daily doses were 0.2 mg (equivalent) of clonidine and 122.9 mg of captopril. After eight weeks of treatment, blood pressures were reduced to 132.9/85.2 mmHg in the clonidine group (n = 22) and 131.2/82.5 mmHg in the captopril group (n = 16). In black patients, blood pressure reductions were greater with clonidine than with captopril. Four patients were withdrawn from treatment because of side effects in the clonidine group and one in the captopril group. No between-group differences were found in the responses to a quality-of-life questionnaire completed before and after treatment. The clonidine patches were worn during 99% of patient-weeks of treatment; captopril was taken as directed during 64% of patient-weeks of treatment. It is concluded that transdermal clonidine is safe and effective and well accepted by hypertensive patients.", 
    "349": "Captopril, an orally active angiotensin I-converting inhibitor, is an effective drug in the treatment of hypertension in adults and children. The use in newborn infants has been, nevertheless, short. We report five cases of hypertension in newborn infants poorly responsive to large doses of other potent antihypertensive agents: furosemide, propanolol and hydralazine. We have got a reduction in mean blood pressure in three cases, with doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day for a time lesser than a month. Another patient had a reduction with high doses (5 mg/kg), showing increase in mean serum urea, creatinin, potassium and phosphorus levels. This effect disappeared after captopril was discontinued. We suggest the use of captopril in hypertension non-responsive to other antihypertensive agents, mainly in those of renovascular cause.", 
    "350": "In 50 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CCHF, III or IV class), aged 62.8 +/- 9.1 years, who were treated with digoxin (Dx) and furosemide (F) (investigation A), continuous 24-hour ecg registration was performed according to Holter. Next, this treatment was extended by two-week administration of nifedipine (N) or isosorbide dinitrate (S) (investigation B), followed by one-month addition of captopril (Cp) (investigation C). During the last two weeks Dx, F, N or Dx, F, S were administered with Cp being withdrawn (investigation D). At the end of each stage of the treatment ecg registration was repeated according to Holter. At the same time, during the investigation A there were performed determinations of blood serum sodium, potassium and digoxin concentrations, two-dimensional echocardiography and evaluation of submaximal exercise tolerance. In 96 per cent of patients with CCHF, treated with Dx and F, cardiac rhythm disturbances were found. In 53.3 per cent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias occurred, including unstable ventricular tachycardia in 11.1 per cent of patients. Addition of N or S to the classical treatment did not decrease either patient number or amounts of cardiac rhythm disturbances in individual classes according to Lown. Also Cp did not affect numbers of patients with cardiac rhythm disturbances, but it decreased numbers of patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias from 53.3 per cent to 28.9 per cent (from 24/45 to 13/45). At the same time, Cp significantly decreased numbers of ventricular arrhythmias in class 3 and 4a (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "351": "The effect of sublingual captopril on the pressor response to intubation was studied in 40 patients. Captopril was used in one of two doses (12.5 mg and 25 mg) 25 minutes before tracheal intubation. Both doses were associated with a significant reduction in the pressor response to intubation (p less than 0.05) compared to placebo, but no significant difference existed between the two doses. Neither dose controlled changes in heart rate at intubation. Untoward hypotension occurred in the treatment groups. Caution is advised in the peri-operative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "352": "We tried to assess the value of both ventricular function changes and its correlation with maximal exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. For this purpose, a double blind crossover study was designed, and the change in the exercise tolerance and both ventricular ejection fraction were evaluated. When compared with digoxin treatment (p less than 0.01) and with a control-period (p less than 0.001), the captopril increases total exercise time significantly. The response of right ventricular ejection fraction was similar. The changes in right ventricular ejection fraction, but not those of left ventricular ejection fraction, correlated with the variations of exercise time (r = 0.67). These facts suggest that right ventricular function is an important determinant of exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure and that its behaviour explain, in part, the response to captopril treatment.", 
    "353": "Arterial pressure is within 'normal' limits in most diabetic patients with or without microalbuminuria and elevated in 70% of patients with overt diabetic nephropathy. An abnormal increase in the level of urinary excretion is a strong predictor of the subsequent development of overt diabetic nephropathy and ultimately renal insufficiency. Correction of hypertension is associated with a reduction in the rate of decline of the glomerular filtration rate in overt diabetic nephropathy. In patients with microalbuminuria, short-term studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in contrast with calcium antagonists, decrease urinary albumin excretion. Additional studies assessing the long-term effect of antihypertensive agents on the evolution of early diabetic nephropathy are needed. The superiority of ACE inhibitors over other antihypertensive agents in the treatment of overt or early diabetic nephropathy remains to be demonstrated. In addition to arterial pressure control, it is possible that optimal glycaemic control in addition to the modification of protein intake, dietary sodium and serum lipid profile may alter the course of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "354": "Angiotensin (Ang) II and prostaglandins, especially prostaglandins E2 and I2, regulate the glomerular filtration of albumin. Albuminuria can be induced by angiotensin II and possibly by prostaglandins. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril, enalapril or lisinopril reduces albuminuria and glomerular injury in experimental and clinical renal diseases, especially diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduces albuminuria in nephrotic patients regardless of the aetiology of the nephrosis. Judicious clinical use of either class of therapy can result in sustained reductions (50-75%) in proteinuria and possible attenuation of the rate of decline of glomerular function.", 
    "355": "1. Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagi (15 Hz, 0.2 ms, 3 s, 7-15 V) produced a slight bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetized guinea-pig. This effect was fully abolished by atropine, while gallamine (0.1-10 mumol kg-1) produced a dose-dependent increase up to ten fold. 2. Gallamine-induced potentiation of neurally-mediated bronchoconstriction was not inhibited by depletion of sensory neuropeptides with capsaicin or by pretreatment with pyrilamine. In propranolol-pretreated guinea-pigs the potentiation induced by gallamine 3 and 10 mumol kg-1 was inhibited by 40 and 46%, respectively. 3. Physostigmine (0.5 mg kg-1) produced a very slight and slowly developing bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetized guinea-pig, which was also potentiated dose-dependently by gallamine (0.1-10 mumol kg-1). 4. Gallamine (10 mumol kg-1) potentiated the bronchial anaphylactic response induced by aerosol challenge with ovalbumin in actively sensitized guinea-pigs. 5. These results suggest that neither sensory neuropeptides nor histamine are involved in the gallamine-induced potentiation of neurally-mediated bronchoconstriction, while inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system may play a minor role. They are in general agreement with the hypothesis that gallamine antagonizes acetylcholine selectively at prejunctional muscarinic receptors in the guinea-pig airways, thus increasing its release from parasympathetic nerve terminals. These autoreceptors appear to be operant during anaphylactic bronchoconstriction.", 
    "356": "General considerations in planning therapy of heart failure include identification of the cause, rapidity of onset, and the age of the patient. Neonates and young infants with acute onset heart failure frequently develop acidaemia, respiratory compromise or failure, and metabolic derangements such as hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia. These complications require early recognition and urgent therapy. The diagnosis of heart failure in neonates with ductal dependent congenital cardiac lesions (such as coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome or pulmonary valve atresia) allows the early institution of alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) therapy to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus, which stabilises these infants before surgical therapy. Classic therapy for infants with heart failure due to a large left-to-right shunt consists of salt restriction, diuretics and digoxin. If this treatment is inadequate an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (e.g. captopril) is added to therapy. The question then arises whether captopril and diuretics should be the initial therapy and digoxin added if this treatment fails. Acute heart failure may occur in the immediate postoperative period after cardiac surgery or may complicate acute overwhelming infections. Therapy consists of volume loading, vasodilator or inotropic agents. Heart failure due to various forms of chronic dilated cardiomyopathy usually responds to treatment with salt restriction, diuretics, digoxin and captopril. Acute deterioration requires treatment with vasodilators and/or inotropic agents. Heart failure in fetuses may occur from sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and may respond to treatment of the mother with antiarrhythmic agents such as digoxin or procainamide.",

    "358": "Captopril decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in Na-depleted rats and inhibits the stimulation of glomerular prostanoid synthesis induced by Na depletion. Because K loading stimulates glomerular prostanoid production in normal rats, we studied the effects of K loading in Na-depleted captopril-treated (LNC) rats. Potassium, but not Cl, loading stimulated the glomerular synthesis of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2). Urinary kallikrein-like activity (UKALLV) and plasma aldosterone increased in K-loaded animals. LNC rats had lower clearances of inulin (CIN) and p-aminohippurate (CPAH) than controls (0.22 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.07 and 0.56 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.23 +/- 0.23 ml.min-1.100 g body wt-1, both P less than 0.01). KCl-loaded LNC rats had CIN and CPAH greater than LNC (0.64 +/- 0.16 and 1.90 +/- 0.28 ml.min-1.100 g body wt-1, P less than 0.01). Similar results were observed in LNC rats loaded with a K solution not containing Cl, but not in LNC rats loaded with a mixture of CaCl2, MgCl2, and HCl. In KCl-loaded LNC rats, cyclooxygenase inhibition decreased CIN from 0.49 +/- 0.09 to 0.30 +/- 0.08 ml.min-1.100 g body wt-1 (P less than 0.01). Aprotinin did not affect renal function despite significant decrease of UKALLV. We conclude that K loading prevents the decrease of GFR induced by captopril in Na-depleted rats and that this might be mediated by stimulation of glomerular prostanoid synthesis.", 
    "359": "We produced maximal or near-maximal acute intrarenal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by combining inhibitors. Intrarenal infusion of the renin inhibitor, ACRIP, the converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide, and saralasin were administered individually or combined in random order. The inhibitors were infused for 20 min in doses that did not produce systemic effects in uninephrectomized conscious dogs in sodium balance at 10 meq/day. Significant increases in urine flow rate (UV; F = 97, P less than 0.0001), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV; F = 220, P less than 0.0001), glomerular filtration rate (GFR; F = 64, P less than 0.0001), and renal plasma flow (RPF; F = 108, P less than 0.0001) were observed with each blocker, whether alone or in combination except that ACRIP alone did not alter GFR or RPF. The increase in renal function was related to the number of blockers (3 greater than 2 greater than 1). With the three blockers combined UV increased approximately sixfold (from 0.5 +/- 0.06 to 2.9 +/- 0.03 ml/min), UNaV approximately 10-fold (from 3 +/- 0.4 to 34 +/- 2.8 mueq/min), GFR from 31 +/- 2 to 49 +/- 2 ml/min, RPF from 59 +/- 1 to 120 +/- 4 ml/min, and fractional excretion of sodium from 0.06 +/- 0.01 to 0.5 +/- 0.4% (all P less than 0.001). These changes did not occur where the inhibitors were infused systemically and the changes during intrarenal blocker administration were blocked completely with co-administration of angiotensin II intrarenally. The intrarenal RAS is a potent physiological regulator of renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "360": "A number of reports share the conclusion that the captopril test is an adequate screening procedure for the detection of renovascular disease among hypertensive patients. Therefore, we prospectively studied the value of this test in 149 consecutive hypertensive patients. The test was considered positive if plasma renin activity, after an oral dose of 25 mg of captopril, rose by more then 4.44 ng.L-1.s-1 (16.0 ng/mL per hour). The sensitivity of the test was 39%, the specificity was 96%, the positive predictive value was 81%, and the negative predictive value was 79%. No clinically important cutoff point identifying patients with renal artery stenosis could be detected in the values of baseline and stimulated plasma renin activity nor in baseline blood pressure or changes after captopril testing. The low sensitivity makes the captopril test unfit to be used as a screening procedure in an unselected hypertensive population.", 
    "361": "Renovascular hypertension is potentially curable but of low prevalence. A previous retrospective study has demonstrated the use of a potentiated increase in plasma renin activity after captopril administration as a diagnostic test for renovascular hypertension; this requires two blood samples for plasma renin activity determination and three inclusive criteria for a positive test result. We applied this test prospectively to screen 100 hypertensive patients for renovascular hypertension. We evaluated 29 patients with renovascular hypertension; the remainder were diagnosed as having essential hypertension. In our patient population, a postcaptopril plasma renin activity of 5.7 ng of angiotensin per milliliter per hour (ngAl.mL-1.h-1) or greater had a 100% sensitivity and an 80% specificity for renovascular hypertension. An absolute increase in plasma renin activity with captopril of 4.7 ngAl.mL-1.h-1 or greater had a lower sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 87%, whereas a fractional increase in plasma renin activity after captopril of 150% or higher had the lowest sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 86%. A subgroup analysis of 38 patients who were receiving diuretic therapy demonstrated that the test sensitivity was unchanged but the specificity was reduced. In conclusion, a single postcaptopril plasma renin activity value of 5.7 ngAl.mL-1.h-1 or greater is a simplified screening test for renovascular hypertension, with excellent sensitivity and acceptable specificity. This test is well tolerated, inexpensive, and easy to perform.", 
    "362": "The potential adverse consequences of increased adrenergic nervous system activity in patients with heart failure are now recognized. Modulation of the plasma noradrenaline response to submaximal exercise should be desirable. The long-term (9 weeks) effects of milrinone (10 mg 4 times a day) or captopril (50 mg 3 times a day) compared to placebo were evaluated in a double-blind crossover study, in 16 patients with stable, congestive heart failure receiving digoxin and furosemide. After treatment, clinical status (score range 0 to 14 points) improved significantly with both milrinone (4.4 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.01) and captopril (4.1 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.01). Plasma noradrenaline at rest was similar with both drugs and not significantly different from placebo. During submaximal exercise it increased significantly to 1,228 +/- 58 pg/ml with placebo and to 1,295 +/- 174 pg/ml with milrinone; this response was reduced significantly with captopril, to 820 +/- 100 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). Thus, long-term therapy with both captopril and milrinone improved the clinical score, but only captopril reduced the plasma noradrenaline response to submaximal exercise. These findings suggest that angiotensin-enzyme inhibition with captopril will modulate the adrenergic system response to daily activities in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and therefore could have additional salutary effects beyond vasodilatation.", 
    "363": "The metabolism of angiotensin (Ang) peptides was studied in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells which express Ang II receptors, renin, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase A (converting enzyme), as well as Ang I and Ang II. In these experiments, 0.2 nM of either 125I-Ang I or 125I-Ang II was incubated with intact cell monolayers and the medium was analyzed for 125I-products by high performance liquid chromatography. The major product generated from the metabolism of labeled Ang I or Ang II was identified as the amino-terminal heptapeptide Ang-(1-7). N-benzyloxycarbonyl-prolyl-prolinal (ZPP), a specific inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase, inhibited the formation of Ang-(1-7) from Ang I by 35%. Complete inhibition of Ang-(1-7) generation was attained with p-chloromercuriphenyl-sulfonate, which suggests that a sulfhydryl-containing peptidase other than prolyl endopeptidase is also involved in Ang-(1-7) formation. Ang II was observed to be a minor product resulting from Ang I metabolism. Although the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (MK-422) significantly reduced Ang II formation, it had no effect on the levels of Ang-(1-7). These findings demonstrate a preferential processing of Ang I into Ang-(1-7) which is not dependent on the prior formation of Ang II.", 
    "364": "Hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg of enalapril (n = 50) or 10 mg of lisinopril (n = 47) daily. During a four-week titration period, the doses were increased weekly to a maximum of 40 mg once daily until the treatment goal of diastolic blood pressure (BP) of less than 90 mmHg was reached; treatment was then continued for four weeks. Systolic and diastolic BP declined significantly in the two treatment groups, from 147/98 mmHg in both the enalapril and lisinopril groups to 126/82 and 122/81 mmHg, respectively, at the end of treatment. During the first week of treatment, the goal of diastolic BP of less than 90 mmHg was reached by 40% of the enalapril group and 62% of the lisinopril group; by the end of the titration period, 98% and 96%, respectively, had achieved the BP goal. Few side effects were reported and there were no abnormal laboratory findings during treatment. It is concluded that once-daily administration of enalapril or lisinopril was generally effective and well-tolerated in the management of mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.", 
    "365": "We have recently found presence of a high concentration of a novel type of kinin, hydroxyprolyl3-bradykinin (Hyp3-BK) in human tumor ascites in addition to conventional bradykinin (BK). Because of their potential physiological activity, it is of interest to know how these bradykinins can be degraded in ascites. Degradation of two synthetic kinins, BK and Hyp3-BK, added to the ascitic fluid from patients with ovarian carcinoma and hepatoma, were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. Both kinins were degraded into their desArg9-BK or -Hyp3-BK and desPhe8-Arg-9-BK or -Hyp3-BK products following incubation with the ascitic fluid. The rate of the degradation of BK and Hyp3-BK was the same. The formation of desArg9-BK was completely inhibited by kininase I inhibitor, while the formation of desPhe8-Arg9-BK was not completely inhibited by a kininase II inhibitor. The degradation of both kinins was inhibited completely by EDTA. The results indicate the presence of other metalloprotease(s) which cleaves kinins in the ascitic fluid, in addition to kininase I and kininase II. The carboxypeptidase A and carboxypeptidase B inhibitor, benzyl malic acid, failed to block degradation of both kinins. A rapid cleave of Phe-Arg into Phe and Arg was also found in the ascitic fluid. Thus, the major degradation products of kinins in the ascitic fluid were demonstrated to be either desArg9-BK or Hyp3-BK, desPhe8-Arg9-BK or -Hyp3-BK, phenylalanine and arginine. Lysyl-BK and lysylhydroxyprolyl3-BK were rapidly converted into BK and hydroxyprolyl3-BK by the ascitic fluid.", 
    "366": "In order to investigate the hypotensive mechanisms of action of peptide renin inhibitors, blood pressure responses to five renin inhibitors were compared with those to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, in conscious African green and rhesus monkeys. (3S-4S)-4-amino-5-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxy pentanoic acid (ACHPA)-containing renin inhibitory peptide (ACRIP) and enalaprilat both decreased blood pressure in euvolemic and volume-depleted African green monkeys. However, while a maximum dose of enalaprilat reduced blood pressure to 80 +/- 4 and 56 +/- 4 mmHg in the euvolemic and volume-depleted monkeys, respectively, ACRIP lowered pressure to life-threatening levels (less than 40 mmHg) under both conditions. The relative potencies of ACRIP and four other renin inhibitors for inhibiting in vitro plasma renin activity (PRA; IC50) were compared with their potencies in reducing blood pressure by 15 mmHg (ED15 mmHg) and lowering blood pressure more than enalaprilat in volume-depleted rhesus monkeys. All renin inhibitors lowered blood pressure significantly beyond the maximal response to enalaprilat. Despite a significant correlation (r = 0.99, P less than 0.05) between the in vitro PRA inhibitory potency and the in vivo ED15 mmHg, doses which lowered blood pressure beyond the maximal responses to enalaprilat were not significantly correlated (r = 0.53, P greater than 0.05) with the in vitro PRA IC50 values. Furthermore, the profound depressor responses to renin inhibitors in rhesus monkeys were accompanied by increases in the heart rate and decreases in pulse pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "367": "The short-term and long-term effects (for up to 98 days) of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were investigated in male and female BALB/c mice. In control animals, separate antisera to renin and its prosequence produced an identical pattern of staining in granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) a short distance from the glomerulus. After 1 day of the enalapril treatment there was a decrease in the number of JGA granular cells immunostained with antisera to both renin and its prosequence. Electron microscopy revealed degranulation of mature granules from JGA granular cells. Fusion of granules with the cell membrane was not observed, but numerous membrane-like structures (myelin figures) were identified in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, indicating possible secretion. In addition, the volume proportion of granulated cells in relation to the glomerular volume was decreased, as was renal renin content. With continuing enalapril treatment, separate antisera to renin and its prosequence stained the same granulated JGA cells with equal intensity. The cells so stained increased in number, extending down the wall of the afferent arteriole to cortical radial arteries (interlobular arteries) upstream from the glomerulus. Ultrastructural studies revealed a progressive development of cytoplasmic granulation in JGA granular cells and in smooth muscle cells extending into cortical radial arteries. Furthermore, the volume proportion of granulated cells in relation to the glomerular volume was significantly increased, as was renal renin content. Thus, short-term enalapril treatment in mice provoked rapid secretion of renin via degranulation of mature granules from JGA granular cells. In contrast, long-term enalapril treatment produced a continuing stimulus for renin synthesis, secretion and storage, resulting in an increased thickness of the afferent arteriolar wall. The mechanism for this change appears to be hypertrophy and hypergranulation of granular JGA cells and neogranulation of smooth muscle cells upstream from the glomerulus. Identification of the intrarenal mediators that induce these phenotypic changes presents an interesting challenge.", 
    "368": "Angiotensin II, ACTH and potassium chloride were administered to rats for 6 days and the effects on adrenal renin-like activity and adrenal angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity were investigated. Rats infused with angiotensin II (140 pmol/min) either ip or sc showed increases in adrenal angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity (p less than 0.05) and plasma aldosterone concentration (p less than 0.05), but no change in adrenal renin-like activity. Captopril treatment of angiotensin II-infused rats caused a slight decrease in angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity which did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, rats treated with ACTH (Cortrosyn-Z, 3 IU/day, sc) showed an increase in adrenal renin-like activity (p less than 0.01), but no significant change in adrenal angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity. Rats treated with KCl in drinking water showed increases (p less than 0.05) in adrenal renin-like activity, adrenal angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity, and plasma aldosterone. These results suggest that angiotensin II, ACTH and potassium, three major regulators of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland, have different effects on the adrenal renin-angiotensin system when administered in vivo.", 
    "369": "1. In order to examine the potential role of atrial natriuretic factor in modulating the increased sodium excretion per nephron in chronic renal failure, we studied 12 uraemic patients on the last day of two successive 7 day periods during which their sodium intake was 100 and 20 mmol of sodium/day, respectively. 2. There was a parallel decrease from 6.31 +/- 0.75 to 2.17 +/- 0.32% in the fractional excretion of filtered sodium and from 234.4 +/- 74.9 to 80.6 +/- 20.3 pg/ml (supine position) or 140.1 +/- 43.6 to 60.7 +/- 14.6 pg/ml (upright position) in plasma atrial natriuretic factor. Both parameters were significantly correlated during the two periods of different sodium intake (P less than 0.05). The ratio of plasma guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate to plasma creatinine changed proportionally to plasma atrial natriuretic factor. Plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity increased during the sodium-depleted period but only plasma renin activity was significantly correlated with fractional excretion of filtered sodium. 3. The predominant role of atrial natriuretic factor compared with that of aldosterone in the renal response to varying sodium intake is suggested both by regression analysis and by the effect of 5 day's treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) in six other uraemic patients on a normal (100 mmol/day) sodium intake. Such treatment, although resulting in a significant increase in plasma renin activity and a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone, at least in the supine position, did not modify the fractional excretion of sodium and plasma atrial natriuretic factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "370": "The liver cell entry of enalaprilat, the polar, pharmacologically active dicarboxylic acid metabolite arising from esterolysis of enalapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was examined in the perfused rat liver by use of the multiple-indicator dilution technique. [Phenylpropyl-2,3-3H]enalaprilat was injected into the portal vein in a bolus of blood containing 51Cr-labeled red blood cells (a vascular reference) and 125I-labeled albumin and [14C]sucrose (interstitial references that do not enter cells), with observation of the time courses of their outflow into the hepatic venous blood. A quantitative evaluation of the data was carried out by use of the barrier-limited, space-distributed variable transit time model (C.A. Goresky, G.G. Bach, and B. E. Nadeau, J. Clin. Invest. 52:991-1009, 1973). For data up to 60 s after injection, the transfer coefficients for influx, efflux, and sequestration were 0.018 +/- 0.004 (means +/- SD), 0.044 +/- 0.017, and 0.033 +/- 0.007 s-1, respectively. The influx permeability surface area product (influx clearance) per gram was 0.0057 +/- 0.0013 ml.min-1.g-1, and the rapidly accessible cellular equilibrium distribution space for enalaprilat was 0.137 +/- 0.022 ml water/g wet wt. At times beyond 60 s, the fitted data deviated systematically from the experimental data, suggesting the presence of an additional intracellular pool. With this addition, the coefficients for transfer between the intracellular pools were 0.0150 +/- 0.0045 s-1 for the direction cytoplasmic pool (pool 1)----additional pool (pool 2) and 0.0234 +/- 0.0069 s-1 for the opposite direction, and the fitted volumes of pools 1 and 2 became 0.126 +/- 0.021 and 0.082 +/- 0.018 ml/g, the total accessible cellular distribution space became 0.208 +/- 0.036 ml/g wet wt, and the sequestration transfer coefficient became 0.027 +/- 0.007 s-1. The data indicate that, as previously postulated (I. A. M. de Lannoy and K. S. Pang, Drug Metab. Dispos. 14: 513-520, 1986), the enalaprilat flux across liver cell membranes is retarded by a diffusional barrier. The results also indicate that enalaprilat is excluded from part of the volume of hepatocytes, as expected for an anionic compound crossing the membrane in charged rather than protonated form, given the negative electrical potential of the cytosol vs. the extracellular space.", 
    "371": "To date, there is no universally accepted therapy for viral myocarditis. We investigated the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on both early and late phases of coxsackievirus murine myocarditis. Mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 and were divided into two main protocols. Mice in the early treatment protocol (n = 30) were treated on day 1 after infection with either captopril or saline through day 6 of infection and euthanized on day 6 of infection. In the late treatment protocol, mice (n = 60) were treated starting on day 10 of infection through day 30 of infection with either captopril or saline. Mice were killed on days 20 and 30 of infection. In the early treatment protocol, heart weight was 67 +/- 14 mg in the captopril-treated group versus 98 +/- 17 mg in the control group (p less than 0.0001). The degree of inflammation, necrosis, and dystrophic calcification assessed with a semiquantitative histological score was significantly less in the captopril-treated group. The degree of pathological involvement determined by planimetry of histological sections was 8.1 +/- 7.2% for the captopril-treated group versus 22.5 +/- 10.0% for the saline-treated group (p less than 0.0001). In the late treatment protocol, captopril also caused a reduction in heart weight as compared with controls at day 20 (116 +/- 21 mg in captopril-treated group vs. 166 +/- 34 mg in controls, p less than 0.0001) and also at day 30 (136 +/- 23 mg in captopril-treated group vs. 185 +/- 48 mg in controls, p less than 0.004). On days 20 and 30 of infection, the degree of inflammation, necrosis, and dystrophic calcification was similar in both groups. We conclude that captopril is beneficial in acute coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis because it reduces heart weight and necrosis when administered early and reduces heart weight when administered in a delayed manner.", 
    "372": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability largely account for interindividual differences in the response to antihypertensive drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The factors determining the response to enalapril have been investigated in a placebo-controlled study in essential hypertension. The effects of placebo, the initial dose of enalapril, and long-term (1 and 6 weeks) treatment with enalapril were studied in 13 subjects. By using an integrated kinetic-dynamic model that incorporates a parameter for saturable protein binding, individual responses for blood pressure reduction and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition were characterized in terms of the maximum effect (Emax) and the drug concentration required to produce 50% of Emax (Ce50). In individual subjects, plasma enalaprilat concentrations could be correlated with falls in blood pressure and changes in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity. For the group, Emax was -46.1 +/- 16.5 and -19.7 +/- 3.8 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, and the corresponding Ce50 values were 66.1 +/- 20.2 and 61.6 +/- 22.5 ng/ml.

There was no relation between the responsiveness to enalapril (Emax or Ce50) and patient age or plasma renin activity, but there was a significant positive correlation between Emax and the pretreatment blood pressure.

    "373": "1. To dissociate the effects on the development of diabetic renal injury of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition per se, and a reduction in systemic blood pressure, we have studied the effects of chronic ramapril treatment in streptozotocin diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats, with modulation of the hypotensive effect by a high salt diet. 2. Three weeks following uninephrectomy and induction of diabetes with streptozotocin, spontaneously hypertensive rats were allocated to three treatment groups. Groups 1 and 2 received 1% sodium chloride and Group 3 water as drinking solution. Groups 2 and 3 received 0.4 mg/kg per day ramapril in drinking solution over the subsequent 2 month study period. 3. Sodium chloride drinking solution (1%) completely prevented any hypotensive effect of ramapril. Blood pressure was reduced in Group 3 rats over the entire period of study, when compared with Group 2 rats (P less than 0.001). 4. Urinary protein excretion progressively increased in Group 1 and 2 rats, and was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) in Group 3. After 2 months treatment, urinary protein (expressed as mean and s.e.m.) was 160 +/- 30 mg/day in Group 1, 240 +/- 50 mg/day in Group 2, and 60 +/- 11 mg/day in Group 3. 5.

    "374": "Elevation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a feature of diabetes mellitus in humans and in animal models. Angiotensin II has been implicated as a mediator of GFR in diabetes. The acute effect of inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with captopril on renal haemodynamic and endocrine parameters was therefore studied in 14 normotensive male Type 1 diabetic patients, and the responses compared with those in five normal male control subjects. Following captopril 12.5 mg orally the diabetic patients exhibited an acute fall in GFR from 122 +/- 3.8 to 113 +/- 4.5 ml min-1 1.73-m-2 (p less than 0.02) and a rise in renal plasma flow (RPF) from 670 +/- 57 to 797 +/- 46 ml min-1 1.73-m-2 (p less than 0.01) which resulted in a fall in filtration. This did not occur in normal control subjects. Natriuresis occurred only in normal control subjects. There was no change in urinary excretion of PGE2 or kallikrein in either group but excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha fell in the diabetic patients. There was a significant correlation between glycosylated haemoglobin and baseline RPF (rs = -0.79, p less than 0.001) and filtration fraction (rs = 0.83, p less than 0.001) that persisted when the change in these variables following captopril was analysed. Our results are compatible with the response to ACE inhibition in diabetic patients being secondary to inhibition of angiotensin II and suggest that this response may be related to blood glucose control.",

Plasma renin activity rose significantly as a consequence of ACE inhibition (P less than 0.05, ANOVA) but plasma aldosterone was unaltered. Cilazapril is a potent ACE inhibitor with a rapid onset and prolonged duration of antihypertensive and endocrine effects. Studies of the effects on ACE inhibition on the renin-angiotensin system in Africans are required.", 
    "376": "We have previously shown that transplantation of kidneys from genetically hypertensive to normotensive rats result in hypertension in renal graft recipients. To investigate whether this posttransplantation hypertension may have been the result of damage to the renal graft by high perfusion pressure before transplantation, we normalized blood pressure throughout life in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) kidney donors by continuous antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (1 mg.kg-1.day-1 in drinking fluid). When kidneys from these rats were transplanted at age 20 wk to age-matched bilaterally nephrectomized F1 hybrids bred from SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) parents, posttransplantation hypertension still developed. In contrast, blood pressure did not change significantly in recipients of kidneys from ramipril-treated WKY rats. In the initial phase, recipients of SHR kidneys had a lower body weight and higher plasma urea concentrations than recipients of WKY kidneys. However, in the chronic phase, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to daily water intake, plasma urea concentration, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, and weight of transplanted kidneys; no histological differences were observed between renal grafts from WKY and SHR donors, except for structural vascular hypertrophy in the latter group. We conclude that posttransplantation hypertension in recipients of SHR kidney grafts also develops, when the grafts have not been subjected to high renal perfusion pressure before transplantation. Our data support the hypothesis that SHR kidneys carry a primary defect, which can induce hypertension in renal graft recipients.", 
    "377": "The efficacy of once-a-day cilazapril (a new long acting converting enzyme inhibitor) therapy for the 24 h control of hypertension and its effects on the renin-angiotensin axis were investigated. Twenty-four uncomplicated hypertensive patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressures remained within 94 to 114 mmHg after four weeks of placebo were randomly assigned on a double-blind basis to receive either continued placebo or cilazapril therapy at a single dose of 1.25, 2.5 or 5.0 mg/day for a further four weeks. At the end of weeks 4 and 8, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rates were recorded, supine and standing, at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h following a single dose of drug. At the same times, blood was withdrawn for determination of plasma renin activity and aldosterone. Supine and erect systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lowered to normotensive levels with an optimal response being achieved at a dose of 2.5 mg/day. Supine and erect heart rates were unchanged with respect to drug dosage, and the reflex increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure on changing from supine to erect posture was maintained in all groups. Maximum antihypertensive efficacy was from 2 to 6 h after drug ingestion. There were no changes in resting aldosterone, but plasma renin activity was increased at all drug dosages. A single 2.5 mg dose of cilazapril provides blood pressure control for a 24 h period. Cilazapril does not appear to interfere with the reflex autonomic responses to postural change.", 
    "378": "To investigate the mechanisms by which small changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) affect aldosterone, 10 normal young men were infused for 2 h with 0.6 pmol/kg.min human [Ser,Tyr28]ANH under 3 study conditions: 1) high salt diet (H), 2) low salt diet (L), and 3) low salt diet plus pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (LE). Baseline ANH levels were higher on H than on L or LE. A postural drop in ANH was observed when subjects went from standing to sitting. Plasma ANH levels increased during infusion by up to 4.5 pmol/L (H, 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 11.5 +/- 1.4; L, 4.3 +/- 0.6 to 8.7 +/- 1.1; LE, 4.2 +/- 0.5 to 8.6 +/- 1.5). At all time points, plasma ANH was well within the normal range. Plasma aldosterone did not change during H, decreased by about 60% for both low salt conditions, and remained suppressed at 1 h of recovery for L, but not for LE. This suggests that ANH can suppress aldosterone by both indirect and direct mechanisms, although the indirect mechanism appears to predominate. A prompt increase in urine flow was seen during ANH infusion and was sustained at 1 h of recovery, but little change was seen in urinary sodium or potassium excretion, heart rate, or blood pressure. The difference between the natriuretic and diuretic effects of ANH was seen under all conditions. These results support the hypothesis that within the normal physiological range, ANH is a regulator of salt and water metabolism in normal man.", 
    "379": "In 1987 to 1988 there was a significant increase in drug costs in Australia. This was largely the result of the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors into clinical practice. In this article the implications of escalating drug costs are examined. The impact of revolutionary new drugs is considered, and it is questioned whether even a relatively wealthy country, such as Australia, can afford the high costs of these new agents. The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is discussed, and modification of this into a two-tier system is proposed. A two-tier system could preserve the present list and the essential elements of the current scheme but would introduce a second list of new drugs for which a premium would be charged. Such a system could recoup costs generated by new drugs and also restrict overprescribing but may limit the prescription of new drugs to less well-off persons. The article concludes by considering the total health care budget, taking into account the relative cost-benefit expenditures of hospital care and drug therapy.", 
    "380": "The relative contribution of the gut, liver, and lung to the first-pass hydrolysis (bioactivation) of the orally administered prodrug, fosinopril sodium (FS), to the active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, SQ 27,519 (S), was determined. Two dogs each received 14C-FS by the following routes of administration: oral, intraportal, and intra-arterial. Extraction ratios (E) for the gut and liver were calculated based on the relative ratios of the AUC of FS in arterial plasma after administration of FS by various routes. The high intrinsic capability of the gut and liver to hydrolyze FS was reflected by E values which ranged from 69 to 91%. Since the gut is the first site after an oral dose, its contribution to the overall first-pass hydrolysis (greater than 75% of the absorbed dose) was estimated to be significantly greater than that of the liver (less than 25% of the absorbed dose). Concentrations of FS were similar in central arterial and venous plasma after a steady state arterial infusion of 14C-FS, indicating that the lung is apparently not a site of prodrug hydrolysis. This conclusion was consistent with the results of in vitro studies that indicated the following order of esterase activity: liver = kidney much greater than small intestine greater than blood, aorta, and lung. When data from in vitro studies were extrapolated to the in vivo situation, the blood itself was not a significant site for hydrolysis of FS in dogs. Based on the body clearance of FS (approximately 30 ml/min/kg) estimated after the intra-arterial route, roughly 50% of the systemic hydrolysis of the prodrug appears to occur at extrahepatic site(s), such as the kidney.", 
    "381": "The hemodynamic effects of nifedipine and captopril at doses producing similar reductions in arterial pressure were studied in pentobarbital-anesthetized ventilated dogs after splenectomy during ganglion blockade with hexamethonium. Mean circulatory filling pressure (Pmcf) was determined during transient circulatory arrest induced by acetylcholine at baseline circulating blood volumes and after increases of 5 and 10 mL/kg. Central blood volumes (pulmonary artery to aortic root) were determined from transit times, and separately determined cardiac outputs (right atrium to pulmonary artery) were estimated by thermodilution. Nifedipine (n = 5) increased Pmcf at all circulating blood volumes and reduced total vascular capacitance without a change in total vascular compliance. Central blood volume, right atrial pressure, and cardiac output were increased with induced increases in circulating blood volume. In contrast, captopril (n = 5) did not alter total vascular capacitance, central blood volume, right atrial pressure, or cardiac output at baseline or with increased circulating volume. Thus, at doses producing similar reductions in arterial pressure, nifedipine but not captopril increased venous return and cardiac output in ganglion-blocked dogs.", 
    "382": "The effects of A-64662, a new specific renin inhibitor, on plasma renin activity (PRA) and blood pressure (BP) were studied for the first time in patients with essential hypertension. A single intravenous bolus of vehicle, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg was given to the first four patients, maintained on a constant 100 mEq Na diet. PRA was promptly reduced from 3.4 +/- 2.9 (mean +/- SEM) to 0.2 +/- 0.06 ng/ml/h, a 94% inhibition with the smallest dose, and to undetectable levels (less than 0.1 ng/ml/h) with the larger ones. However, BP did not change within this dose range. The subsequent seven patients received larger doses ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/kg. In three cases, there was reduction in BP on the second dosing day, at doses of 0.4, 0.7, and 1 mg/kg. All responses were late (at 110 min after the injection), transient, and unrelated to baseline PRA. These results strongly suggest that there is a dissociation between the effectiveness of A-64662 in inhibiting PRA and its blood pressure lowering effect in hypertensive patients.", 
    "383": "Three groups of New Zealand white rabbits were used to study the effects of captopril on the renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system during sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension and halothane anesthesia. Two groups of rabbits (C and CH) were treated with captopril 2 mg/kg i.v. One captopril-treated group (CH) and the third, untreated group (H) received SNP to induce hypotension. In these two groups, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was reduced by 40% for 150 min. Group C did not undergo SNP-induced hypotension and served to document the effects of captopril alone during the 150-min study period. Arterial blood samples for norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were drawn prior to, during hypotension, and in the recovery period. The SNP dose required to maintain the hypotension was continuously recorded. NE, EPI, and PRA all increased in group H, indicating activation of both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic system during hypotension. This was accompanied by a dramatic increase in SNP dose requirement. In the CH group, PRA levels rose sharply and remained elevated. Plasma NE levels increased, while EPI levels remained unchanged with a decline in the SNP dose requirement. The C group demonstrated a rise in PRA levels, accompanied by unchanged NE and EPI levels and MAP during the study period. Captopril administration decreased the SNP dose requirement and significantly decreased the sympathetic response (measured by NE and EPI levels) in group CH as compared to the H group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "384": "In a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled crossover design, the renal hemodynamic and tubular effects of 2-month specific vasodilation with a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril, 40 mg once daily) was compared with that of a calcium antagonist (verapamil slow release, 240 mg twice daily) in 15 patients with established essential hypertension. Enalapril and verapamil treatment induced a 9% reduction in mean blood pressure (BP). Heart rate (HR) was similar after placebo (66 beats/min), enalapril (63 beats/min), and verapamil (63 beats/min). Plasma norepinephrine (P-NE) was unaltered after enalapril and verapamil as compared with placebo (0.92, 0.88, and 1.33 nM, respectively). Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone decreased and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased after enalapril but were unaltered after verapamil. Glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA) was not altered by either enalapril or verapamil, whereas renal blood flow (125I-hippurate) was reduced 9% by verapamil. Renal vascular resistance (RVR) was unchanged after enalapril as well as verapamil. Fractional excretion of electrolytes and diuresis were unaltered and body weight was similar after enalapril, verapamil, and placebo (81.0, 82.5, and 80.2 kg, respectively). Long-term treatment with enalapril and verapamil had a comparable antihypertensive effect. Neither enalapril nor verapamil appeared to induce reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Renal hemodynamic and tubular function was well preserved with both drugs without signs of sodium and water retention.", 
    "385": "The functional role of the endothelium in conversion of angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II was studied in helical strips of dog renal arteries. In the arteries precontracted with PGF2 alpha, Angs I and II caused a moderate relaxation, which was abolished by treatment with saralasin and reversed to a contraction by indomethacin. Removal of the endothelium attenuated the response to Ang I but did not abolish it. The Ang I-induced relaxation in the arteries without endothelium was not significantly attenuated by an Ang-converting enzyme inhibitor, SA446, but was markedly suppressed by chymostatin. On the other hand, in the arteries with endothelium, the relaxation was suppressed but not abolished by SA446, and the remaining relaxation was abolished by additional treatment with chymostatin. Relaxation induced by prostaglandin I2 was unaffected by these enzyme inhibitors. These results strongly suggest that the conversion of Ang I to Ang II is due mainly to the Ang-converting enzyme in the endothelium and to the chymostatin-sensitive Ang II-generating enzyme in subendothelial tissues.", 
    "386": "We contrasted the effects of D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-DPhe-Thi-Arg-TFA (kinin receptor antagonist), of aprotinin (kallikrein inhibitor), and of combined treatment with captopril (kininase II inhibitor) and phosphoramidon (neutral endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor) on renal function of rats with and without 14-day deoxycorticosterone pretreatment (DOC, 25 mg.kg-1.wk-1 sc). Neither the kinin antagonist nor aprotinin affected renal function in rats with and without DOC pretreatment. Combined treatment with captopril and phosphoramidon caused in rats with and without DOC pretreatment augmentation (P less than 0.05) of kinin excretion (50-64%), glomerular filtration rate (12-11%), and sodium excretion (46-48%). In DOC-pretreated rats undergoing infusion of captopril and phosphoramidon, the superimposed administration of either the kinin antagonist or aprotinin caused the lowering of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, and sodium excretion. These effects of the kinin antagonist and aprotinin in rats infused with kininase inhibitors may be the consequence of blockade, respectively, of the renal actions and synthesis of kinins that, when in excess, elicit renal vasodilation and increase glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion. Collectively, these observations suggest regulatory influence of kinins during conditions featuring increased renal kinin levels.", 
    "387": "Two biotinylated derivatives of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, were synthesized. Compounds BL11 (epsilon-biotinamidocaproyl-lisinopril) and BL19 (epsilon-biotinamidocaproyl-beta-alanyl-beta-alanyl-lisinopril) have, respectively, 11 and 19 atoms of spacing structure between the biotin and the inhibitor moieties. Both compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of mouse kidney ACE, but they lost this ability in the presence of streptavidin in free solution. However, BL19 (but not BL11), when complexed to ACE, retained enough residual binding strength for streptavidin to allow the complex to be specifically removed from solution by streptavidin-agarose beads. It was thus possible to employ BL19 for the affinity isolation of ACE from crude mixtures. These results indicate that the bound determinant of lisinopril must lie at least 11 A below the outer surface of the ACE molecule.", 
    "388": "In the present paper the authors review the results of more than ten years' experience with ACE-inhibitors in the therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The importance of tissue rather than serum ACE level for the long-term response to these agents has been mainly stressed. Clinical studies have shown the importance of these agents for the general practitioner in view of both their efficacy and the low incidence of untoward effects. If further studies succeed in showing the extent to which individual mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors contribute to the overall therapeutic effect it can be expected that it will become possible to synthetize new molecules with more selective action. Considering the hypothesis according to which these agents are also effective for the prevention and management of myocardial infarction and in the management of chronic renal failure, these studies would appear to be particularly urgent.", 
    "389": "A prospective, randomized efficacy study of low-dose enalapril was undertaken in 38 outpatients (24 men, 14 women; mean age 58 [41-69] years) with chronic heart failure (NYHA functional class III-IV). All patients were pretreated with digitalis and diuretics, some also with conventional vasodilators. 19 patients (group E) received in addition to their previous medication, 5 mg enalapril daily, while the other 19 (group K) continued with their previous therapy. Three months later, 15 patients in group E improved by at least one NYHA functional class and none died (P less than 0.02). Four patients in group K died and only one patient improved by one class. After three months, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) in group E (39 +/- 19%) compared to group K (30 +/- 14%). In group E, plasma aldosterone concentration decreased significantly (P less than 0.0001) by 33.4 +/- 6.5 ng/dl, while in group K no significant change occurred (delta 1.1 +/- 1.2 ng/dl). Thus, low-dose enalapril in addition to conventional therapy may improve the clinical status of patients in severe chronic heart failure. This improvement is associated with an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction and reduction in secondary hyperaldosteronism.", 
    "390": "We studied the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on two models of gastric ulcers; oxyphenbutazone and ethanol-induced lesions. There was a significant protective effect against oxyphenbutazone-induced ulcers, which was prevented by prior administration of indomethacin. Captopril, however, failed to protect against ethanol-induced lesions. These findings are discussed in the light of captopril being a sulfhydryl compound with prostaglandin-releasing activity.", 
    "391": "Etozolin is a new diuretic with hypotensive properties. The above research was aimed to evaluating the effects of etozolin, captopril and their combination in a group of 30 patients with essential hypertension; age range 42-74 years, average 76.6. Patients were subdivided into two groups for a controlled cross-over trial. Group I was treated for 4 weeks with daily etozolin doses of 200 mg, and, after a period of withdrawal until basal values were restored, for a further 4-week period with captopril, 25 mg 3 times daily. Group II had the same treatments in the opposite order. After this cross-over experiment, all patients were treated for 16 weeks with both drugs in combination at the same dosage. Treatment with etozolin led to a reduction of arterial blood pressure from 187/112 +/- 10/4 mmHg to 167/99 +/- 7/6 mmHg; for captopril the corresponding figures were from 186/112 +/- 11.5 mmHg to 163/98 +/- 7.4 mmHg and for the combination from 188/112 +/- 10/5 mmHg to 154/86 +/- 6/5 mmHg. These findings confirmed the efficacy of etozolin and captopril alone; the combination of the two drugs led to a significantly more marked reduction of pressure values compared to monotherapy and neutralized such biochemical changes as had been observed after administration of the two drugs alone. Tolerance was excellent for all treatment schedules used.",

Patients underwent a repeat exercise ECG 24 hours following either 5 mg ramipril p.o. or placebo. Plasma-ACE activity (nmol/min x ml) in the ramipril-group (n = 8) was significantly reduced 24 hours after 5 mg ramipril compared to placebo (n = 10): 14.0 +/- 2.0 vs 87.2 +/- 13.5, p less than 0.001. Exercise-induced ST-segment depression was not different before and after ramipril or placebo. Heart rate at rest and during angina-limited exercise was not different between the first exercise-ECG and that after ramipril or placebo, nor between the groups. Systolic arterial pressure (mmHg) was slightly, but insignificantly, lower after than before ramipril at rest (113.8 +/- 5 vs 125 +/- 6.8) and at maximal exercise, 1.5 watt/kg (150 +/- 9.4 vs 158.3 +/- 13.3). In the placebo group, blood pressure at rest and during exercise was not different before and after placebo: 126 +/- 4.7 vs 125.5 +/- 7.5 and 157.5 +/- 3.8 vs 158 +/- 3.6.

    "393": "From a pathophysiological point of view, antihypertensive therapy with a vasodilator is rational. However, since traditional vasodilators, such as hydralazine, may cause retention of sodium and water, tachycardia and excessive stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, they are not suitable for monotherapy. The Ca-antagonists include a number of drugs with quite different chemical structures. Ca-antagonists are powerful antihypertensive agents. This effect is due primarily to vasodilation caused by the interference with the excitation-contraction coupling in peripheral resistance vessels. All Ca-antagonists possess a natriuretic effect which apparently counteracts the sodium and water retention that vasodilation per se entails. Ca-antagonists cause no (verapamil) or a transient tachycardia (dihydropyridines) and they only cause a moderate and transient increase in plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin II, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration is unaffected. Ca-antagonists have no metabolic side effects and in general the frequency of side effects is relatively low. Therefore, it is suggested that Ca-antagonists should be considered as possible first-choice agents along with diuretics, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "394": "The activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1), measured using Hip-His-Leu as substrate, was determined in the developing chick retina, and in monolayer and aggregate cultures of embryonic retinal cells. ACE specific activity in chick retinal homogenate increased 86-fold from embryonic day 13 until the 7th post-hatching day. The development of ACE activity occurred in parallel with that reported for synapse and photoreceptors. ACE activity expression in aggregates, but not in monolayer culture, was similar to that observed in the developing retina in ovo. At culture, day 13, ACE specific activity was 11.8-fold higher in the aggregate than in the dispersed cell culture, and was comparable to that in a 21-day-old embryonic intact retina. Our results suggest that histotypic association of retinal cells during development may be an important event controlling the expression of ACE activity in the CNS.",

The rats were divided into a 22.5% protein diet group (Gr 1), a 6% protein diet group (Gr 2), and an enalapril-treated group on 22.5% protein diet (Gr 3). Group 4 animals served as age-matched controls. Both diets were isocaloric and had the same phosphorus content. Rats from groups 1, 2, and 4 were sacrificed at 12, 18 and 24 weeks. Five rats of group 3 were sacrificed at 12 weeks, and the others were divided in subgroups 3A (diet changed to 6% protein) and 3B (no changes); half of each subgroup was sacrificed at 18 and 24 weeks, respectively.

    "397": "We report on the distress associated with physical symptoms in 761 male hypertensive patients enrolled in a clinical trial of the effects of captopril, methyldopa or propranolol on quality of life. Educational level at entry into the trial showed a negative association with a series of physical symptom distress items among patients not previously treated with antihypertensive medications but no association with symptoms among the previously treated. Over the 24 weeks of therapy captopril as monotherapy was associated with no change from baseline in distress in all symptoms examined. In contrast, distress increased in the methyldopa treated patients for dry mouth and blurred vision. Propranolol treated patients had increased \"trouble getting breath,\" bradycardia, shortness of breath or wheezing, and blurred vision. Between group comparisons revealed significant differences favorably comparing captopril to both methyldopa and propranolol in regard to fatigue, and blurred vision, as well as to methyldopa alone for dry mouth and \"feeling worn out.\" There were significant differences as well between captopril and propranolol with patients on propranolol worsening in bradycardia. Other comparisons of patients on propranolol and methyldopa monotherapy showed propranolol patients worsening in bradycardia and loss of taste, but methyldopa patients reported more dry mouth and feeling worn out than those on propranolol. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to therapy worsened total physical symptom distress scores for methyldopa and propranolol patients. This study confirms the value of methods which assess the degree of distress associated with symptoms commonly reported by hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive medications. This approach can be useful in establishing a treatment regimen least likely to cause distress and can be of value in preserving quality of life, preventing noncompliance, and withdrawal from treatment.", 
    "398": "We have investigated the effect of chronic administration of enalapril on the carboxypeptidases responsible for the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I and other peptidases known to recognize angiotensin I as a substrate in the rat. These studies have shown an increase in activity in rate of formation of des-Leu-angiotensin I in both kidney S2 and P2 centrifugal fractions as well as a decrease in the rate of degradation of angiotensin I substrate. Similar increases in the formation of A(1-8) have been observed in kidney using A(1-9) as substrate. These two enzyme activities have been named carboxypeptidase K1 and K2, respectively to reflect their presence in rat kidney. These changes were accompanied by significant decreases in the activity of an amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase and endopeptidase 24.11 in the kidney P2 fraction. These data suggest that chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors may differentially affect the activity of other enzymes capable of degrading angiotensin causing a substantial re-direction of angiotensin metabolism.",

    "400": "We conducted this study to examine the effects of exogenous and locally synthesized angiotensin II (Ang II) on cultured bovine glomerulosa cell functions (i.e., aldosterone secretion and cell proliferation measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation into the deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) after the arresting cell growth). The effects of Ang II were found to depend on the culture conditions. After 72 hours of serum-free culture, the differentiated function of cultured cells such as Ang II-induced aldosterone secretion was suppressed, and DNA synthesis was stimulated by Ang II. After 24 hours of serum-free culture, the cells showed a good steroidogenic response and DNA synthesis was inhibited after Ang II was added in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-11) to 10(-7) M). Ang II was detected in 24 hours of culture grown in a serum-free medium by a specific Ang II radioimmunoassay. Ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that this immunoreactive (ir) Ang II was composed mainly of Ang II with small amounts of angiotensin III (Ang III). The concentration of irAng II in the cultured medium was significantly reduced by the addition of captopril, indicating de novo generation and secretion of Ang II. Captopril (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) reduced aldosterone secretion and reciprocally increased DNA synthesis. Ang II antagonist, [Sar1, Ile8] Ang II, increased DNA synthesis presumably by competitive blockade of locally synthesized Ang II. In summary, Ang II inhibited cell proliferation. In addition to exogenous (circulating) Ang II, Ang II was generated and secreted by the glomerulosa cells themselves, and this locally synthesized Ang II appeared to work as an autocrine factor to stimulate aldosterone secretion and to suppress cell proliferation.", 
    "401": "Successful long-term treatment of hypertension must include consideration of individual patients' life-style interfaced with the potential for adverse drug events. In a postmarketing surveillance study, 30,515 patients received captopril monotherapy and were evaluated by 7792 physicians. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced 17 and 11 mm Hg, respectively. Mean diastolic blood pressure was reduced 10% for patients with mild hypertension; larger mean reductions were noted for patients with moderate (16.5%) and severe (21.5%) hypertension. Captopril therapy was equally effective in all races (white, Hispanic, and black patients), age groups, and in isolated instances of systolic hypertension. Only 4.9% of patients reporting an adverse event required discontinuation of therapy. Headache (1.8%) and dizziness (1.6%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. Quality-of-life measures improved.", 
    "402": "In a 24-week randomized multicentre single-blind study, including mild to moderate hypertensives free from other diseases, the effect on blood lipids of captopril (n = 51) was studied and compared with that of metoprolol (n = 53). In order to keep the diastolic pressure less than 95 mm Hg, bendroflumethiazide was added to the medication for 11 patients in the captopril group and 11 patients in the metoprolol group. Neither captopril nor metoprolol altered total cholesterol significantly. Captopril as monotherapy increased HDL-cholesterol by 6.2% (P less than 0.01) and decreased triglycerides by 10.6% (P less than 0.05). Metoprolol as monotherapy decreased HDL-cholesterol by 5.6% (P less than 0.01) and increased triglycerides by 10.3% (P less than 0.05). When bendroflumethiazide was added the favourable effect of captopril on the blood lipids disappeared while the undesirable effect of metoprolol became more pronounced.", 
    "403": "To evaluate whether cyclosporine nephrotoxicity is progressive, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were determined by isotopic techniques in 24 cyclosporine-treated organ transplant recipients (12 heart, 1 pancreas, and 11 kidney recipients). The cyclosporine group demonstrated reductions in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, with higher renal vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure as compared with an azathioprine-treated control group. However, longitudinal studies over a mean time period of 23 months in eight cyclosporine-treated renal transplant recipients showed renal function to remain stable. In the entire group of 24 cyclosporine-treated patients, longer duration of cyclosporine treatment was associated with decreased but stable glomerular filtration rate, increased renal plasma flow, decreased renal vascular resistance, and lower daily doses of cyclosporine. Evaluation of intrarenal resistances demonstrated a greater decrease in efferent than afferent arteriolar resistance, consistent with the fall in plasma renin activity that occurred with time. Short-term treatment of 12 patients with prazosin produced no beneficial effect on renal function, whereas treatment of nine patients with captopril produced a 20% increase in renal plasma flow, with a significant reduction in renal vascular resistance. We conclude that although cyclosporine treatment produces decreased renal function, the loss in renal function is not necessarily progressive. Treatment with captopril may improve the abnormal renal hemodynamics of cyclosporine-treated patients.", 
    "404": "We investigated the distinct ability of various antihypertensive drugs to modulate the extent (%) of rapid (15 minutes) resetting of the baroreceptors of normotensive rats to hypotensive levels. In one protocol, hemorrhage produced a complete resetting to hypotension in rats chronically treated (6 days) with captopril. Also, hemorrhage produced only partial resetting in rats acutely treated (10-15 minutes before baroreceptor recording) with captopril and in control (untreated) rats (73 +/- 7% and 49 +/- 5%, respectively). In another protocol, all vasodilators produced hypotension in normotensive rats. Nifedipine produced complete (93 +/- 4%) resetting to hypotension, whereas prazosin produced near-maximal (83 +/- 3%) resetting. The remaining drugs studied (phenoxybenzamine, trimethaphan, and MgSO4) induced a partial resetting (63 +/- 7%, 63 +/- 9%, and 50 +/- 5%, respectively) that did not differ significantly from the extent observed with hemorrhage in control (untreated) rats. These results demonstrate that different antihypertensive drugs distinctly modulate rapid baroreceptor resetting to hypotensive levels and that nifedipine and long-term treatment with captopril associated with hemorrhage modulate rapid resetting to hypotension in a more efficient manner.", 
    "405": "Captopril (0.15-10 mg/kg) administration in the anesthetized dog causes immediate hypotension concomitant with an increase in tonus of the assay tissue (cat terminal ileum) superfused with circulating blood (Vane's cascade method). The increase in cat terminal ileum tonus was antagonized by a bradykinin receptor antagonist, L-349b. Treatment of the animals with indomethacin blocked or reversed the hypotensive effect of captopril without affecting the increase in tonus of the cat terminal ileum. Captopril potentiated the hypotension induced by bradykinin injected intra-arterially, and indomethacin reduced the hypotensive effect of intra-arterially injected bradykinin. Addition of captopril or enalapril to the superfusing blood maintained at 37 degrees C in an extracorporeal circuit caused a long-lasting increase in the tonus of the cat terminal ileum. The present results support the hypothesis that immediate hypotension induced by captopril involves a prostaglandin-dependent component possibly resulting from increased bradykinin levels generated in the vicinity of captopril action.", 
    "406": "New findings from this laboratory suggest that fragments of angiotensin derived from the amino (N-)terminus are biologically active end products of the renin-angiotensin system. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is a major endogenous product of the renin-angiotensin system cascade in the brains of rats and dogs. Additional studies with enzyme inhibitors showed that Ang-(1-7) is produced directly from angiotensin I by an enzyme other than the angiotensin converting enzyme. Immunocytochemical fibers within the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal vasopressinergic system of the rat. Although Ang-(1-7) is as potent as angiotensin II (Ang II) in stimulating release of vasopressin from superperfused hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal explants, the heptapeptide has no dipsogenic or vasoconstrictor activity. In contrast, Ang-(1-7) mimics the effects of Ang II in augmenting the intrinsic discharge rate of neurons within the vagal-solitary complex and in causing monophasic depressor responses after microinjection into the medial region of the nucleus tractus solitarii. The evidence obtained in these experiments suggests novel mechanisms for the generation of angiotensin peptides in the brain. Additionally, the findings suggest that some of the biological actions ascribed to Ang II might be conveyed by the endogenous production of other angiotensin peptides that are generated by enzymatic pathways alternate to those described in the peripheral circulation.", 
    "407": "We used the technique of high-performance liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassay to establish the profile of angiotensin peptides in the periphery and across the circulation of the dog's heart. Data were obtained before and after blockade of angiotensin converting enzyme, and after acute myocardial ischemia produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Baseline values of plasma renin activity and immunoreactive angiotensin II were higher in the aortic root than in the coronary sinus but concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin-(1-7) were similar. In untreated animals, coronary occlusion produced significant increases in renin activity and arterial and venous levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Inhibition of converting enzyme with benazeprilat (CGS-14,831) increased baseline circulating levels of angiotensin I, whereas angiotensin II and its carboxyl terminal fragments were reduced markedly. Baseline plasma levels of angiotensin-(1-7) and its fragments did not change. Myocardial ischemia in benazeprilat-treated dogs increased plasma renin activity and circulating levels of angiotensin I. Concentrations of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) did not change either in peripheral blood or across the coronary circulation. These results indicate that angiotensin peptides can be formed endogenously by enzymatic pathways alternate to converting enzyme. Furthermore, these data provide the basis for a further understanding of the role of the renin-angiotensin system after myocardial ischemia.", 
    "408": "A patient undergoing groin lymph node dissection with spinal and general anaesthesia was receiving enalapril to control hypertension. Infusion of stable plasma protein solution (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Australia) was associated with significant hypotension and flushing. A brief review of stable plasma protein solution and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor pharmacology is presented to provide a possible mechanism for these events. This mechanism implies that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy is a relative contraindication to rapid SPPS infusion.", 
    "409": "Although angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor agent in all tissues, including the human forearm, equivocal effects on forearm blood flow (FBF) have been found after angiotensin blockade. In 13 healthy Na(+)-depleted subjects FBF was measured by the 133Xe washout technique; subcutaneous and muscle blood flows were determined separately. FBF was measured during supine rest, after the arm was lowered, and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The measurements were repeated during intra-arterial saralasin infusion in six subjects and after intravenous administration of enalapril in seven subjects. FBF decreased and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) increased during arm lowering and LBNP, as the result of local and central adrenergic reflexes, respectively. We observed similar FBF and FVR values after both saralasin and enalapril, except for a decrease in FVR at rest after enalapril. It is concluded that, in the human forearm, angiotensin II is not necessary for sympathetic vasoconstrictor reflexes but may, through a central effect, have some influence on arteriolar tone at rest.", 
    "410": "This is a report of a case history of a child with cerebral Moyamoya disease and gradual development of systemic hypertension. Sodium depletion combined with enalapril induced renal failure. A bilateral renal artery stenosis was found. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was not successful and was followed by autotransplantation of both kidneys. Histopathological examination of the renal arteries revealed intimal hyperplasia.", 
    "411": "High doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, is known to cause significant increases in urinary protein excretion in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. To find whether other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors yield similar results, we prospectively examined the effect of enalapril in five consecutive patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, elevated arterial pressure, and proteinuria and compared them to age-matched controls receiving clonidine. Glomerular filtration rate, 24-hour urinary protein excretion, and arterial pressure were measured. All patients served as their own controls. Those who received enalapril demonstrated an initial increase in proteinuria (-0.3 +/- 0.7 delta gm/day, clonidine vs 3.9 +/- 0.9 delta gm/day, enalapril: P less than .05) despite similar decreases in arterial pressure (-18 +/- 6 delta mm Hg, clonidine vs -22 +/- 6 delta mm Hg, enalapril: NS) and glomerular filtration rate (-1.1 +/- 0.8 delta mL/min, clonidine vs -1.9 +/- 1.2 delta mL/min, enalapril: NS) when compared to the clonidine group. This increase in proteinuria, however, did not occur when these patients were rechallenged with enalapril. To our knowledge, this is the first report to document a significant increase in preexisting nephrotic range proteinuria following administration of nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor. This increase, however, appears to be unique to the initial treatment phase of the disease and does not affect long-term management.", 
    "412": "Libenzapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to healthy male volunteers in a randomized, two-phase pharmacokinetic study. One phase compared the pharmacokinetics of a 4 mg intravenous infusion and 20 mg oral solution, and the other phase provided two additional intravenous infusions of 1.7 and 12 mg for comparison. The intravenous model-independent pharmacokinetic parameters MRTiv, Vss, CL, and CLr all exhibited dose dependence. The concentration dependent renal clearance was maximal at 83 mL/min and minimal at 32 mL/min following intravenous administration. The mechanism of libenzapril's self-inducible clearance appears to have a pharmacodynamic basis. The absolute bioavailability was estimated at less than 10% and the renal clearance following oral administration exhibited additional route dependency.", 
    "413": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, reduced the motility of washed human spermatozoa. The concentrations producing 50% inhibition were: (percentage motility) 11.6 +/- 2.6 mM, (average forward velocity) 8.0 +/- 1.5 mM and (motility index) 8.5 +/- 2.1 mM (mean + s.e.m.). Enalapril 20 mM prevented all forward movement and reduced percentage motility to an extremely low level. Motility was reduced within 20 sec of addition and little further change occurred during a 60-min incubation period. Inhibition of percentage motility by enalapril was reversible with a 5-min washing procedure following a 5-min incubation period, but not following a 60-min incubation period. Enalapril 20 mM did not impair plasma membrane integrity (hypoosmotic swelling test) or viability (nigrosin-eosin stain). It is concluded that the antimotility effects of enalapril are not caused by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, but may be of interest in the search for new spermicidal agents.", 
    "414": "It has been suggested that angiotensin II (ANG II) activation after renal ablation contributes to the altered glomerular dynamics and proteinuria that characterizes this model of chronic renal failure. In the present study, male Munich-Wistar rats underwent 75% renal ablation (Nx group). Two weeks later, micropuncture studies were performed in sham-operated rats (sham group) and Nx group rats during intravenous infusion of either a vehicle or two ANG II inhibitors, namely [Sar1, Ala8]ANG II or MK-421 administered at a rate of 0.3 and 1 mg.kg body wt-1.h-1, respectively. Acute ANG II inhibition in sham group had no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP), glomerular dynamics, or proteinuria. In contrast, in Nx group ANG II inhibition lessened glomerular hypertension (from 64.7 +/- 1.0 to 55.4 +/- 1.7 mmHg, P less than 0.0001) the result of postglomerular vasodilation (P less than 0.01), normalized the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (from 0.038 +/- 0.002 to 0.005 +/- 0.002 nl.s-1.mmHg-1, P less than 0.0001), and attenuated proteinuria (from 42.1 +/- 6.5 to 28.1 +/- 5.4 micrograms/min, P less than 0.01). MAP, single-nephron GFR and plasma flow were unaffected. These results suggest that ANG II activity is enhanced in nephrectomy, contributing in a major way to altered glomerular dynamics and proteinuria.", 
    "415": "The effects of the intravenous administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor benazeprilat on left ventricular function were examined in 18 patients with ischemic heart disease. Twenty minutes after drug infusion (0.3-10 mg), heart rate (78 +/- 17 to 71 +/- 16 beats/min, p less than 0.0003), left ventricular systolic pressure (-9 mm Hg, p less than 0.0004), and plasma norepinephrine concentration all decreased significantly. The isovolumic indexes of inotropic state also decreased slightly (-10% in dP/dtmax, p less than 0.001), whereas the ejection fraction (39 +/- 16% to 41 +/- 16%, p less than 0.08) and the end-systolic volume (-6%, p less than 0.04) tended to improve, probably because of the afterload reduction (-13% in mean systolic wall stress, p less than 0.05). After benazeprilat administration, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was unchanged at the group level, but there was a consistent downward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation during rapid filling, and the mean diastolic wall stress decreased from 99 +/- 73 to 69 +/- 42 kdyne/cm2 (p less than 0.007). These data indicate that the acute administration of benazeprilat has a dual action on left ventricular pump function, which is that the negative inotropic effect of bradycardia and reduced sympathetic drive are compensated by afterload reduction. The drug also improved left ventricular diastolic distensibility and significantly reduced wall stress during diastole. The beneficial effects on diastolic function were noted both in patients with mild left ventricular dysfunction and in patients with heart failure.", 
    "416": "To evaluate the effect of converting enzyme inhibition induced by enalapril on parasympathetic activity, we studied ten essential hypertensive patients, age range 38-58 years, WHO I-II. Parasympathetic evaluation was obtained by measuring the variation of heart period (VHP) during at least 1 minute of steady-state, regular respiration. VHP was derived from the difference between the mean of all maximum and the mean of all minimum heart periods. The higher the VHP, the higher the parasympathetic control of heart rate and vice versa. VHP was measured supine and with tilting (30 degrees, 60 degrees, 85 degrees). Blood pressure was reduced after 1 month of enalapril treatment, while the heart rate did not change. VHP increased at the end of enalapril treatment compared with placebo: in the supine position it increased from 36 +/- 3.2 ms to 44 +/- 3.5 ms, p less than 0.01. VHP was also increased by enalapril at 30 degrees (p less than 0.05) and 60 degrees (p less than 0.05), while no difference was observed at 85 degrees between placebo and enalapril. A positive correlation was found between supine enalapril changes of VHP and those of systolic and diastolic BP. In conclusion, enalapril seems to increase parasympathetic cardiovascular control in essential hypertensive patients. This result might explain the lack of increase in heart rate that would be expected as a result of the vasodilating effect of enalapril.", 
    "417": "Twenty-three patients with severe hypertension and impaired renal function were included in an open study of the efficacy and tolerance of felodipine treatment over 6 months. All patients were previously treated with a diuretic, a beta blocker, and a vasodilator, and eight of them also received an ACE inhibitor. At the start of felodipine treatment the previously used vasodilator was withdrawn. In nine patients the concomitant antihypertensive treatment was reduced during the study. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as 51Cr EDTA clearance, was determined before and at the end of the study. The blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded at all clinical visits in the morning 12 hours after the evening dose of felodipine and 2 hours after the morning dose. Plasma concentrations of felodipine were measured at every visit before the morning dose and 2 hours after dose. The BP was reduced after felodipine was substituted for the previously used vasodilator. A significant additional anti-hypertensive effect was recorded 2 hours after the dose and amounted to -37 +/- 22/-15 +/- 12 mmHg (p = 0.0001/p = 0.0002) at 6 months. The effect measured 12 hours after the dose was less pronounced and was -11 +/- 28/-6 +/- 10 mmHg (p = 0.15/p = 0.03). Mean GFR was unchanged during the study, 38 +/- 19 versus 38 +/- 19 ml/min (n = 16). There was a sixfold interindividual variation in the trough plasma concentrations at steady state at the same drug dosage. Higher plasma concentrations seemed to be required to achieve the same antihypertensive effects as in patients with less severe hypertension and normal renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "418": "ACE inhibitors have provided a major advance in cardiovascular therapeutics. The rationale for their use in hypertension and heart failure, and their cardiac effects are well documented. Further information is required on the relevance of their direct myocardial and other tissue effects, and it is likely that their use in hypertension and heart failure will increase further over the next several years.", 
    "419": "The pathogenesis of hypertension is associated with a remodeling of vascular structure. Follow has postulated that the decreased luminal area and thickened medial layer in hypertensive vessels enhances the vasoconstrictive response to vasoactive agents. It is hypothesized that this increase in vascular reactivity may serve to perpetuate hypertension. A growing body of evidence suggests that autocrine-paracrine vasoactive substances and growth factors modulate vascular structure in hypertension. We speculate that therapeutic interventions that normalize blood pressure as well as reverse the vascular remodeling process may have special clinical value. The role of the paracrine renin-angiotensin system and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension is discussed in this context.", 
    "420": "ACE inhibition has provided many insights into the etiology and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Not only have studies using these agents profoundly expanded our understanding of the mechanisms governing preservation of renal perfusion pressures and function beyond arterial lesions, they have provided tools for more precise diagnosis and therapy in clinical practice. ACE inhibitors must be considered the agents of choice for the treatment of renovascular hypertension and provide an effective and safe medical alternative for many patients developing atherosclerotic renovascular lesions with an otherwise unacceptable risk for revascularization procedures. With the advent of widespread clinical use of these agents, however, come many new questions regarding the long-term fate of the kidney beyond vascular lesions and the need for preservation of renal function.", 
    "421": "Based on studies in the rat remnant kidney model, it has been proposed that glomerular hypertension is responsible for the progressive nature of chronic renal disease. In that model, therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced glomerular pressures. As a result, glomerular injury was reduced and the rate of progression of renal disease was slowed. Thus, alterations in hemodynamics may play an important role in glomerular injury. However, it is now evident that a variety of metabolic and other factors affect the progression of renal disease. Moreover, recent studies suggest that ACE inhibitors may also have beneficial effects that are independent of alterations in glomerular pressure. In humans, the glomerular hemodynamic response to renal disease cannot be measured, and it is not known whether or under which conditions glomerular capillary pressure might be elevated. Treatment with ACE inhibitors safely lowers blood pressure without adversely affecting renal function in most patients with nondiabetic chronic renal failure. Although proteinuria and the rate of progression of renal disease may decrease in some patients, these effects are inconsistently seen. Identification of the factors that modulate this variability in response to ACE inhibition may provide new insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of progressive renal disease in humans.", 
    "422": "The natural course of essential hypertensive renal disease is characterized by a slowly progressive impairment of renal function. Initially, the changes are functional and reversible; however, structural changes gradually occur, leading to hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Similarities exist between the early functional hemodynamic changes observed in the essential hypertensive kidney and the physiologic renal effects of angiotensin II. To the degree that the initial functional changes are the result of excessive endogenous production of angiotensin II, interruption of the integrity of this humoral system could be expected to reverse the pathophysiologic sequence of events leading to hypertensive nephrosclerosis. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of the essential hypertensive kidney, the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II, and the acute and chronic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition therapy on the essential hypertensive kidney. The data reviewed suggest that ACE inhibition therapy does reverse the initial functional hemodynamic changes observed in the essential hypertensive kidney and may protect the glomerulus from hemodynamically mediated injury.", 
    "423": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a novel class of antihypertensive and anticongestive heart failure agents with wide patient and physician acceptability. By blocking the formation of angiotensin II in blood and tissue, all ACE inhibitors significantly lower systemic vascular resistance, lower blood pressure, and improve cardiac function, while maintaining or enhancing perfusion of vital organs: kidneys, brain, and heart. Captopril is the first oral ACE inhibitor with an active sulfhydryl group. Enalapril and lisinopril are potent nonsulfhydryl inhibitors of ACE characterized by weak chelating properties. The side effects of skin rashes, pruritus, taste abnormalities, oral ulcers, pemphigus, and blood dyscrasias have been considered to be strongly characteristic of penicillaminelike drugs, including the sulfhydryl ACE inhibitors. The class effects of cough, angio-edema, hyperkalemia, nonoliguric functional renal insufficiency, and hypotension can occur with equal frequency with all ACE inhibitors. It is unclear whether the many yet investigational ACE inhibitors would have distinct advantages over captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and enalaprilat. This paper reviews the comparative structure and clinical pharmacology of the three commercially available but chemically different oral ACE inhibitors.", 
    "424": "The responses of blood pressure (BP) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to captopril were studied in 9 patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) including 7 cases of idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) and 2 cases of aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma (APA). 2 hrs after the administration of 25 mg captopril, plasma renin activity (PRA) increased significantly, plasma angiotensin II (PAII) and aldosterone concentration (PAC) declined remarkably, BP reduced to normal in 4 of 6 patients in IHA, no changes in PRA, PAII and PAC in patients with APA but significant BP drop in patient with APA. The results suggest sensitivity of the hyperplastic adrenal gland to AII is heightened. It is helpful in the diagnosis of PA, BP can be well controlled with combined captopril (75 mg/d) and small dose of spironolactone (60 mg/d) in most of the IHA."
