Because angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is markedly elevated after prolonged ACE-inhibitor treatment, we determined whether the antihypertensive effects of Ang-(1-7) were mediated by release of prostaglandins. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, 10 weeks) were treated for 9 days with either lisinopril (20 mg/kg) or losartan (10 mg/kg) or a combination of both drugs. Rats were implanted with catheters in the carotid artery and jugular vein to record blood pressure and to infuse drug solutions, respectively. Neutralization of circulating Ang-(1-7) by monoclonal antibody resulted in a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure in SHRs treated with either lisinopril or losartan. Administration of CGS 24592 to block Ang-(1-7) formation also resulted in an increase in blood pressure that was comparable to antibody infusion. However, Ang-(1-7) blockade evoked a greater elevation in blood pressure in the lisinopril and lisinopril/losartan-treated rats in comparison to those treated with losartan alone. Acute treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin increased blood pressure to a similar extent to that of CGS 24592, as well as blocked the increase in pressure with the neprilysin inhibitor in the lisinopril/losartan group. In the losartan-treated animals, however, indomethacin increased blood pressure by a larger extent than that of the Ang-(1-7) antibody or CGS 24592, and CGS 24592 did not abolish the subsequent pressor response to indomethacin in these animals. In contrast to the antibody or neprilysin inhibitor, administration of the Ang-(1-7) antagonist D-[Ala7]-Ang-(1-7) increased blood pressure to a similar extent in lisinopril or losartan treatments. Moreover, D-[Ala7]-Ang-(1-7) increased blood pressure to a comparable extent as indomethacin and blocked any further increase with the COX inhibitor in the losartan-treated SHRs. High-resolution emulsion autoradiography revealed 125I-[Sarcosine1, Threonine8]-Ang II (Sarthran) binding in the mesenteric artery and thoracic aorta in the presence of both LOS and the AT2 antagonist PD123319. The non-AT1/non-AT2 Sarthran binding was displaced by Ang-(1-7), DALA, or Ang II. These studies suggest that vasodilatory eicosanoids mediate the antihypertensive effects of endogenous Ang-(1-7) in both LIS and LIS/LOS therapies. Furthermore, in the presence of AT1-receptor blockade, Ang II may interact with a DALA-sensitive site to promote eicosanoid release.", 
    "1": "Appropriate anesthesia for LVAD placement needs to incorporate an understanding of the surgical procedure and LVAD physiology, the altered physiology and pharmacology of the cardiac failure patient, and a knowledge of the interaction of anesthesia with the potent cardiac drugs used in end-stage heart failure therapy. The anesthesiologist is faced with a critically ill decompensated patient, often with altered renal and hepatic function, but must ensure adequate anesthesia to avoid intraoperative awareness. Intelligent use of TEE can assist the surgeon to pinpoint potential pitfalls of LVAD placement and can have a significant effect on improving outcome in these challenging patients.", 
    "2": "ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockers are effective in reducing left ventricular mass in hypertension and heart failure. However, the ability of these drugs to reverse excessive myocyte lengthening and transverse growth in heart failure is unknown.", 
    "3": "L-158,809 (an AT(1) blocker; AT(1)), enalapril (an ACEI), and hydralazine (a vasodilator) were administered to spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats between 6 and 10 months of age (early treatment) and between 18 and 22 months of age (late treatment). After 4 months of treatment, hemodynamics and chamber dimensions were collected before left ventricular myocyte isolation and subsequent analysis of myocyte shape. Each drug reduced systolic blood pressures to normal values. In the early and late studies, the ACEI reduced myocyte volume. Myocyte length was also reduced in the late study. However, the AT(1) was most effective in reversing myocyte dimensions to near-normal values in both studies. Hydralazine was ineffective in reducing cell size but arrested progression of myocyte lengthening in the late study. Changes in myocyte shape reflected alterations in chamber dimensions and wall thickness.", 
    "4": "Reversal of myocyte hypertrophy was produced in hypertensive/heart failure rats with an AT(1). The ACEI was effective but to a lesser extent. Results indicate that it is possible to significantly reverse myocyte remodeling pharmacologically even if therapy is initiated near the onset of failure. Further work is needed to determine whether similar results can be obtained in humans.", 
    "5": "Because hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) prevented and/or regressed fibrosis in liver and pulmonary injury models, HGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic cardiovascular disease. Because angiotensin (Ang) II significantly decreased local HGF production, we performed (1) in vitro experiments using fibroblasts and (2) administration of an ACE inhibitor (temocapril) and an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (CS-866) to cardiomyopathic hamsters.", 
    "6": "In human fibroblasts, HGF significantly increased the production of matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) and urokinase plasminogen activator, whereas HGF also significantly attenuated the reduction of MMP-1 activity induced by Ang II. In contrast, HGF significantly decreased transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta mRNA stimulated by Ang II, whereas HGF also decreased basal TGF-beta protein level without affecting growth. Similarly, in rat cardiac fibroblasts, HGF inhibited the expression and production of TGF-beta, whereas HGF upregulated its specific receptor, c-met. Conversely, in vivo experiments revealed that administration of temocapril and CS-866 to cardiomyopathic hamsters resulted in a significant decrease in fibrotic area and increase in cardiac HGF concentration and mRNA (P<0.01), whereas cardiac concentration and mRNA of HGF were significantly decreased in cardiomyopathic hamsters. In contrast, mRNA expression of collagen III was markedly decreased by treatment with temocapril and CS-866.", 
    "7": "Here, we demonstrated that Ang II blockade prevented myocardial fibrosis in the cardiomyopathic hamster, accompanied by a significant increase in cardiac HGF. Overall, increase in local HGF expression may participate in the prevention of myocardial injury by Ang II blockade through its antifibrotic action.", 
    "8": "Because renal function is affected by chronic heart failure (CHF) and it relates to both cardiovascular and hemodynamic properties, it should have additional prognostic value. We studied whether renal function is a predictor for mortality in advanced CHF, and we assessed its relative contribution compared with other established risk factors. In addition, we studied the relation between renal function and neurohormonal activation.", 
    "9": "The study population consisted of 1906 patients with CHF who were enrolled in a recent survival trial (Second Prospective Randomized study of Ibopamine on Mortality and Efficacy). In a subgroup of 372 patients, plasma neurohormones were determined. The baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR(c)) was calculated using the Cockroft Gault equation. GFR(c) was the most powerful predictor of mortality; it was followed by New York Heart Association functional class and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients in the lowest quartile of GFR(c) values (<44 mL/min) had almost 3 times the risk of mortality (relative risk, 2. 85; P<0.001) of patients in the highest quartile (>76 mL/min). Impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was only modestly predictive (P=0.053). GFR(c) was inversely related with N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; r=-0.53) and, to a lesser extent, with ANP itself (r=-0.35; both P<0.001).", 
    "10": "Impaired renal function (GFR(c)) is a stronger predictor of mortality than impaired cardiac function (LVEF and New York Heart Association class) in advanced CHF, and it is associated with increased levels of N-terminal ANP. Moreover, impaired renal function was not related to LVEF, which suggests that factors other than reduced cardiac output are causally involved.", 
    "11": "To examine the mechanism of inhibition of glycylsarcosine (GlySar) transport by quinapril and enalapril, and whether or not angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are transported by PEPT2 as well as by PEPT1.", 
    "12": "Xenopus laevis oocytes were cRNA-injected with rat PEPT1 or PEPT2 and the transport kinetics of radiolabeled GlySar were studied in the absence and presence of quinapril and enalapril. The two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique was also performed to probe the electrogenic uptake of captopril, quinapril and enalapril.", 
    "13": "Kinetic analyses demonstrated that quinapril inhibited the uptake of GlySar in a noncompetitive manner in Xenopus oocytes injected with PEPT1 or PEPT2 (Ki = 0.8 or 0.4 mM, respectively). In contrast, a competitive interaction was observed between GlySar and enalapril (Ki = 10.8 mM for PEPT1 or 4.3 mM for PEPT2). Most significantly, captopril and enalapril, but not quinapril, induced inwardly-directed currents in both PEPT1- and PEPT2-expressed oocytes.", 
    "14": "These results are unique in providing direct evidence for the substrate recognition and transport of some ACE inhibitors by the high- and low-affinity oligopeptide transporters. Our findings point to differences between PEPT1 and PEPT2 in their affinity to, rather than in their specificity for, ACE inhibitors.", 
    "15": "An intracardiac aldosterone system which responds to short- and long-term physiological stimuli has been described. This cardiac generated aldosterone has possibly autocrine or paracrine actions. Normal cardiac tissue contains mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and cardiac high affinity MR are localized in cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells. Data concerning the presence of MR in cardiac fibroblasts are, however, controversial. MR are not specific for aldosterone but they also bind glucocorticoids. Cardiac fibroblasts however contain the enzyme 11beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase II which converts these glucocorticoids to inactive metabolites. Discordant findings on the in vitro effect of aldosterone on the collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts are reported and can at least partly attributed to the presence of various fibroblasts phenotypes. During chronic aldosterone infusion in uninephrectomized rats on a high-salt diet, a marked accumulation of interstitial and to a lesser extent perivascular collagen occurs in the heart in both ventricles. This cardiac fibrosis in this aldosteronism model is prevented by spironolactone. This effect of aldosterone is crucially dependent on the salt status of the rat. Indeed, rats on a restricted salt intake infused with aldosterone had no cardiac fibrosis above control levels. During the continuous infusion of aldosterone in the rat the appearance of fibrosis was delayed and starts 4 weeks after the beginning of the infusion which argues against a direct effect of aldosterone. The mechanism of aldosterone-salt induced cardiac fibrosis possibly involves angiotensin II acting through upregulated AT1 receptors and the cardiac AT1 receptor is the target for aldosterone. An accumulation of collagen in the heart has also been found in patients with adrenal adenomas and during chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as in surgically induced unilateral renal ischemia, unilateral renal artery banding or renovascular hypertension. Spironolactone prevents aortic collagen accumulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In patients with stable chronic heart failure spironolactone treatment in addition to diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduced circulating levels of procollagen type III N-terminal aminopeptide. Also, in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study spironolactone coadministered with conventional therapy of ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics and digitalis in patients with symptomatic heart failure defined as NYHA classes III-IV reduces total mortality by 30%.", 
    "16": "We examined the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on spontaneous or stimulated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells prepared from 6 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and from age-matched control subjects without COPD. The ROS produced by BAL cells were measured by the lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence method. The application of ACE inhibitors into culture media containing BAL cells inhibited spontaneous and stimulated generation of ROS by BAL cells from COPD patients and control subjects in an ambroxol-concentration-dependent manner. Alacepril, an ACE inhibitor bearing SH-group, inhibited the oxygen radical production and generation by BAL cells from COPD patients in a dose-dependent fashion. Approximately 0.6-0.7 mM of alacepril inhibited 50% of the ROS production by BAL cells from COPD patients, whereas a slightly higher concentration (3 mM) of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor not bearing an SH-group, was necessary to inhibit the production of ROS. These results suggest that an ACE inhibitor may act as an pulmonary antioxidant in patients with COPD.", 
    "17": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has been shown to be involved in the catabolism of the tetrapeptide acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP). As AcSDKP is a physiological inhibitor of haematopoietic stem cell proliferation, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of captopril, one of the specific inhibitors of ACE, on the proliferation of primitive haematopoietic cells. Regenerating bone marrow cells obtained from mice given one injection of cytosine arabinoside (100 mg/kg) as well as SA2 myeloid leukaemia cells were incubated in vitro for 24 h with 10-6 M captopril. Captopril significantly reduced the proportion of high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC-1) in S-phase, whereas it had no effect on the proportion of SA2 leukaemic colony-forming cells in S-phase. When given in vivo to mice 1 h after 2 Gy gamma-irradiation or cytosine arabinoside (AraC) injection, captopril (100 mg/kg) was shown to prevent HPP-CFC-1 entry into S-phase induced by these cytotoxic treatments. The observed effects correlated with a reduction in ACE degradative activity and an increase in the level of endogenous AcSDKP both in the supernatants of captopril-treated bone marrow cells and in plasma of treated animals. The present findings suggest that AcSDKP might mediate the observed in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effects of captopril on primitive haematopoietic cell proliferation.", 
    "18": "Imidapril, enalapril and quinapril were subcutaneously administered to aortic-banded rats by osmotic minipumps to compare the suppressive actions of these angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Among the three drugs tested, imidapril was most potent for the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy, although equipotent hypotensive doses were used. Imidapril reduced both serum and cardiac ACE activities, while enalapril reduced only the former. Quinapril also reduced both, however, it was less potent at reducing the former compared to imidapril. Moreover, only imidapril significantly decreased left ventricular end diastolic pressure, which tended to be increased by aortic-banding. The lipophilicity of ACE inhibitors could not explain the more potent suppressive action of imidapril on cardiac hypertrophy because the lipophilicity of imidaprilat, an active metabolite of imidapril, was as low as an active metabolite of enalapril; i.e., much lower than an active metabolite of quinapril. The efficacy of ACE inhibitors on pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy depends not only on an inhibitory effect on cardiac ACE activity, but also on other actions such as their effect on left ventricular end diastolic pressure.", 
    "19": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin (ET) are involved in the alteration of renal function in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The renal response to Ang II following the reversal of a 24-hour UUO and the effect of ET blockade by bosentan during the time of obstruction were investigated.", 
    "20": "Following blockade of the endogenous production of Ang II by captopril, the renal response to Ang II was studied in rats 15 to 18 days after a 24-hour UUO (N = 10) or a sham operation (N = 9) both with (N = 10) and without (N = 8) bosentan treatment in the periobstruction period. Similar studies were performed in another group (N = 9) two months following the reversal of obstruction.", 
    "21": "In the sham-operated group, Ang II reduced renal blood flow (RBF) by 42 +/- 9% (P < 0.01), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 30 +/- 8% (P < 0.01), urine volume (UV) by 44 +/- 9% (P < 0.001), and absolute (UNaV) and fractional sodium excretion (FENa) by 52 +/- 9% (P < 0.001) and 33 +/- 9% (P = 0.054), respectively. In the previously obstructed kidney, Ang II did not change RBF but increased GFR by 106 +/- 40% (P < 0.01), UV by 75 +/- 21% (P < 0.001), UNaV by 190 +/- 60% (P < 0.001), and FENa by 40 +/- 13% (P < 0.05). Bosentan treatment in the obstructed group prevented these Ang II-induced effects and did not have any effect on the sham-operated kidney. Two months following reversal of the obstruction, the response of the kidney was similar to that of the control kidney.", 
    "22": "Twenty-four-hour UUO results in a temporary abnormality in the renal response to Ang II, which is due, in part, to the actions of ET at the time of obstruction.", 
    "23": "Cardiovascular death continues to be a major problem in renal failure. Structural abnormalities of the heart and the vasculature contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk. They are ameliorated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, but because of the nonspecifity of ACE inhibition, it is uncertain whether the beneficial effect is mediated by interfering with angiotensin II (Ang II) or by modulating other effector systems, for example, bradykinin.", 
    "24": "To assess a potential role of bradykinin, subtotally nephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats (SNX) received either the ACE inhibitor Ramipril (Rami, 0.2 mg/kg body weight p.o.), the specific B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist Hoe140 (0.2 mg/kg body weight, s.c.), or a combination of both, and were compared to sham-operated controls. To separately assess the effect of Ramipril on development and reversal of structural abnormalities, animals were either treated from the third day after SNX or from the fourth week after SNX onward (0.01 mg/kg body weight, p.o.).", 
    "25": "Heart and aorta were evaluated by morphometric and stereologic techniques. The weight of the perfused left ventricle, as an index of cardiac hypertrophy, was significantly higher in untreated SNX. While it was significantly lower in animals with early and late Ramipril treatment, the beneficial effect was completely antagonized by Hoe140. The wall-to-lumen ratio of intramyocardial arterioles was significantly higher in untreated SNX compared with controls, but failed to be modified by administration of either Ramipril or Hoe140. In the heart, the intercapillary distance was significantly higher in SNX, but it was not lowered by either early or late Ramipril or Hoe140 treatment. Treatment of SNX with Hoe140 alone, however, resulted in a marked further increase in intercapillary distance. The wall thickness of the aorta was significantly higher in SNX than in controls; early and late Ramipril treatment prevented such increase, and this effect was antagonized by Hoe140.", 
    "26": "These findings illustrate that bradykinin plays an important role for the beneficial effect of Ramipril in preventing (and potentially reversing) abnormal cardiovascular structure in uremic hypertensive rats.", 
    "27": "Hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous disease, both clinically and genetically. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) is important causes of sudden cardiac death and death from congestive heart failure, although HCM has a relatively benign prognosis. The prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy(DCM) has improved due to advances in earlier diagnosis and therapy, however, sudden cardiac death and death from congestive heart failure still occur in DCM. Accordingly, it is of importance to know possible risk factors on risk stratification for a high-risk group in HCM and DCM. Possible risk factors may contribute to the construction of therapeutic strategies for the prevention of sudden cardiac death or death from congestive heart failure in patients with HCM and DCM.", 
    "28": "Newer drug therapy for patients with cardiomyopathies has been introduced with standard one. Beta-blocker therapy improves the prognosis in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic DCM and even in asymptomatic ones with LV dysfunction. The combined therapy of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker, the intermittent intravenous infusion of inotropic agents and the supplement of phosphodiesterase inhibitor on induction of beta-blocker therapy also elucidate the effectiveness in DCM patients.", 
    "29": "The effects of drug treatment on cardiac events for 11 years from January 1986 to December 1996 were investigated in 1,483 patients with myocardial infarction, 1,164 men and 319 women (mean age 60.1 +/- 11.2 years), followed up for 17.4 +/- 20.9 months. Seventy-one patients (4.8%, 33 cases per 1,000 person-year) had cardiac events (recurrent myocardial infarction, sudden death and death by congestive heart failure). Multivariate analysis showed treatment with cholesterol lowering agents and beta-blockers reduced cardiac events, whereas administration of antiarrhythmic agents increased cardiac events. Univariate analysis showed that the incidence of cardiac events was 2.2% in patients treated with cholesterol lowering agents but 6.2% in patients without treatment, showing a significant difference (p < 0.01). The incidence was 3.2% for patients treated with beta-blockers and 6.8% for those without (p < 0.01), showing that beta-blockers were also effective to reduce cardiac events. Antiplatelet agents were also effective (3.7% vs 7.1%, p < 0.01). Calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and warfarin were not effective. Nitrates (6.0% vs 3.1%, p < 0.01) and antiarrhythmic agents (13.7% vs 3.6%, p < 0.01) increased the incidence of cardiac events. A placebo-controlled, double blind, large clinical multicenter study is required to confirm these results.", 
    "30": "Epidemiological studies suggest that women with heart failure differ from men with heart failure in that their survival is better. Therapeutic trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit for women. This study was to determine the tolerance for high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-nitrates in women versus men and to compare their symptomatic response, exercise tolerance, and ventricular functional improvement over 1 year. Eighty-eight sequential patients with heart failure, 54 men and 34 women with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35%, were prospectively followed for 1 year. For all patients, ACE inhibitor-nitrate therapy was intensified. Each patient had three 6-monthly echocardiograms at baseline, at 6 months, and at 1 year, and metabolic stress testing. Patients were 57.3 +/- 12.3 years old, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class severity 2.6 +/- 1.0. Lisinopril dosages were raised from 14 +/- 14 mg/day to 57 +/- 26 mg/day, isosorbide mononitrate from 15 +/- 27 mg/day to 126 +/- 72 mg/day, and carvedilol (n = 34) to 17 +/- 16 mg/day. Women and men were epidemiologically comparable, with similar baseline echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction 19% +/- 7% versus 17% +/- 6%, respectively). Both tolerated up-titration in medical therapy. Final 12-month ejection fractions were equivalent for women and men at 34% +/- 17% and 34% +/- 13%, respectively, with similar improvements in left ventricular diameters. At 1 year, women had higher resting heart rates and remained more symptomatic with lower exercise capacity. However, the relative changes in NYHA status and aerobic capacity were similar for women and men. Thus, both women and men tolerated uptitrated ACE inhibitor-nitrate medical therapy, with comparable reversal of heart failure remodeling. Although women continued to be more symptomatic than men, relative improvements in symptomatic status, in exercise capacity, and in hospitalization rate were equivalent.", 
    "31": "In this study, using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, the authors assessed the potential for BP control using hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 12.5 mg daily), given as a monotherapy over 12 months to 49 black South African patients with mild to moderate hypertension (mean day diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > or = 90 and < 115 mmHg). Uncontrolled patients received fixed combination of quinapril/HCTZ 10/12.5, 20/12.5, and 20/25 mg, with dose titration at 3 monthly intervals if BP control was not achieved (day DBP < 90 mmHg). Overall, profound and sustained BP reduction was observed at the end of the study. The 24-hour BP decreased from 151 +/- 14/98 +/- 7 to 136 +/- 15/87 +/- 9 mmHg (p < 0.0001 at end of study vs. baseline); the mean day BP decreased from 155 +/- 14/104 +/- 7 to 140 +/- 15/91 +/- 10 mmHg (p < 0.0001 at end of study vs. baseline). The overall control (mean day DBP < 90 mmHg) and response (decrease in day DBP > or = 10 mmHg) rates were 49% and 61%, respectively. At the end of the study, only 2 patients (4%) remained on treatment with HCTZ. Out of the initial 12 patients controlled on HCTZ at 3 months (12/49, 24%), 5 patients remained controlled at 6 months and only 1 patient at 12 months. In contrast, quinapril/HCTZ combinations maintained their antihypertensive effect up to 9 months, with a significant number of patients (22/49, 45%) requiring the highest dose of the combination (20/25 mg daily). In conclusion, low-dose HCTZ should not be recommended as monotherapy in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension due to the fact that the BP-lowering effect is attenuated already at 6 months of treatment, with most patients requiring the addition of the ACE inhibitor.",

    "34": "Among ideal candidates for therapy, women in all age groups were less likely to undergo diagnostic catheterization than men. The difference was especially pronounced among older women; for a woman 85 years of age or older, the adjusted relative risk was 0.75 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.83). Women were somewhat less likely than men to receive thrombolytic therapy within 60 minutes (adjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.96) or to receive aspirin within 24 hours after arrival at the hospital (adjusted relative risk, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 0.97), but they were equally likely to receive beta-blockers (adjusted relative risk, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.03) and somewhat more likely to receive angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (adjusted relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.08). Women were more likely than men to have a do-not-resuscitate order in their records (adjusted relative risk, 1.26; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.29).

Patients had either been untreated or had developed side-effects from previous antihypertensive treatment. When response was inadequate the dose was either increased to 5 mg or another antihypertensive medication was added, or both. Treatment significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Pulse rate decreased significantly from the second month of treatment onwards. At the end of the 3rd month of treatment blood pressure was normalized or had decreased by more than 10 mmHg in 91.9% of patients. Physicians' evaluations revealed improvement in 62%; patients' self-evaluations suggested improvement in 61%. Efficacy was equal in all age groups and in both obese and nonobese patients. Antihypertensive response was superior in those with normal renal function. Side-effects were rare and similar to those reported in the literature.",

They achieve superior blood pressure control with no increase in adverse events compared with their monotherapy components. In addition, they antagonize some class-specific adverse effects and may exhibit beneficial effects on target organ disease, such as renal dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy.",

Use of such combinations could increase patient compliance, by virtue of better tolerance compared with increased-dose monotherapy and simplicity of administration.", 
    "41": "Current trends in the treatment and outcome of acute myocardial infarction were studied in a trial entering 2411 patients with macrofocal myocardial infarction (MI) treated in 1993-1998. There were many cases of severe and repeated MI. The age of the patients tends to increase. Lethal outcomes' probability is very high in multiple stenosis of the coronary arteries. This condition is associated with a high risk of cardiac insufficiency progression because of inadequate blood supply to necrosis-free myocardial zones. Thrombolytic therapy (TLT), ACE inhibitors reduce lethality but their use is limited by such factors as concurrent diseases, time from MI onset, rethrombosis risk. As a result, only 1/5 of the patients received pharmacological treatment. Balloon angioplasty is indicated in contraindications to TLT, in TLT failure or large residual stenosis. ACE inhibitors slow down the progression of cardiac insufficiency giving time for surgical revascularization. Updated treatment of MI improved its outcomes, but further progress in lowering MI lethality will be insignificant unless efficient methods providing adequate blood supply to the myocardium are introduced.", 
    "42": "The tripeptide Hip-His-Leu was used to standardize a fluorimetric method to measure tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in rats. The fluorescence of the o-phthaldialdehyde-His-Leu adduct was compared in the presence and absence of the homogenate (25 microl) to determine whether the homogenate from different tissues interfered with the fluorimetric determination of the His-Leu product. Only homogenates from lung and renal medulla and cortex showed significantly altered fluorescence intensity. To overcome this problem, the homogenate from these tissues were diluted 10 times with assay buffer. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the inhibition of ACE activity with 3 microM enalaprilat (MK-422). There was a linear relationship between product formation and incubation time for up to 90 min for homogenates of renal cortex and medulla and liver, for up to 60 min for ventricles and adrenals and for up to 30 min for the aorta, lung and atrium homogenates. In addition, there was a linear relationship between product formation and the amount of protein in the homogenates within the following range: lung, 30-600 microg; renal cortex and medulla, 40-400 microg; atrium and ventricles, 20-200 microg; adrenal, 20-100 microg; aorta, 5-100 microg; liver, 5-25 microg. No peptidase activity against the His-Leu product (31 nmol), assayed in borate buffer (BB), was detected in the different homogenates except the liver homogenate, which was inhibited by 0.1 mM rho-chloromercuribenzoic acid. ACE activity in BB was higher than in phosphate buffer (PB) due, at least in part, to a greater hydrolysis of the His-Leu product in PB. ACE activity of lung increased 20% when BB plus Triton was used. Enzyme activity was stable when the homogenates were stored at -20o or -70oC for at least 30 days. These results indicate a condition whereby ACE activity can be easily and efficiently assayed in rat tissue samples homogenized in BB using a fluorimetric method with Hip-His-Leu as a substrate.", 
    "43": "The negatively charged membrane AN69 is known to evoke anaphylactoid reactions both without and with concomitant ACE inhibition. Underlying reasons are mainly the induction of bradykinin release due to the negatively charged membrane and the reduced degradation of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition. This complication has been reported repeatedly, but anaphylactoid reactions still occur in clinical practice. We recently had to treat two patients who suffered anaphylactoid reactions during extracorporal therapy with an AN69 membrane and simultaneous ACE inhibition. The first incident occurred in a patient on hemodialysis, the second was in a patient on continuous venovenous hemofiltration. An anaphylactoid reaction induced by an AN69 membrane during continuous, extracorporal treatment in combination with ACE inhibition has not been reported so far. Our report intends to serve as a reminder that the potentially lethal combination of AN69 membranes with ACE inhibitor treatment should be avoided.",

    "66": "1. In the rat balloon injury model, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent vascular remodelling by inhibiting angiotensin II generation and kinin breakdown. We investigated if ACE inhibition also prevents the structural vascular responses to disruption of carotid artery blood flow and if kinin potentiation plays a role in such a protection. 2. Morphometric analysis of the structural alterations caused by ligation of the left carotid artery was performed 14 days after surgery in J129Sv wild-type mice (B(2)(+/+)) drinking normal tap water or water containing captopril (120 mg kg(-1) per day). In addition, the effect of captopril on vascular remodelling was tested in B(2)(+/+) given the bradykinin (BK) B(1) receptor antagonist des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-BK (DALBK, 50 nmol kg(-1) per day, intraperitoneally) or the BK B(2) receptor antagonist D-Arg, [Hyp(3),Thi(5)D-Tic(7),Oic(8)]-BK (icatibant, 1 micromol kg(-1) per day, intraperitoneally), and in B(2) receptor gene knockout mice (B(2)(-/-)). 3. Interruption of blood flow resulted in carotid artery intimal hyperplasia and media thickening in untreated B(2)(+/+), these responses being partially suppressed by captopril. The inhibition of intimal thickening exerted by captopril was reduced in B(2)(+/+) given DALBK or icatibant (P<0.05 for both comparisons) as well as in B(2)(-/-) (P<0.05). Neither antagonism of kinin receptors nor disruption of the B(2) receptor gene altered the suppressive effect of captopril on media thickening. The protection of vascular wall structure was independent of the reduction in blood pressure by captopril. 4. These results demonstrate that kinins participate in the inhibitory effect of captopril on intimal hyperplasia via B(1) and B(2) receptor signalling. Our findings may have important implications in treating vascular remodelling evoked by altered shear stress conditions.",

Enalapril treatment (20 mg/kg per day, p.o.) was started after surgery to induce hypertension or nephrectomy and continued for 5 weeks. 3. The increase in blood pressure of 1K1C rats was associated with activation of cardiac and aortic, but not plasma, ACE activity and with hypertrophy of both heart and aorta. No difference in cardiac output and in vitro systolic function was observed among the groups. Hypertrophied aorta isolated from 1K1C rats displayed increased sensitivity to phenylephrine (PE) and unaltered responses to both acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside compared with the 1K group. 4. Enalapril treatment effectively inhibited plasma and tissue ACE activity in 1K1C and 1K rats. Enalapril did not prevent the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy nor did it change haemodynamic parameters in 1K1C rats. However, enalapril prevented the increase in aortic media thickness and cross-sectional area and restored the hypersensitivity to PE in aortic rings of 1K1C rats. The endothelium-dependent response to ACh was enhanced by enalapril in the aorta of 1K but not 1K1C rats. 5.

Sympathetically influenced low-frequency heart rate variability was significantly increased above baseline in the enalaprilat treatment group 8 hours after initiation of the infusion. Baroreflex gain showed a significant trend to an increase with the maximum value coinciding with the peak in parasympathetic tone.

The dissociation between ACE suppression and autonomic response to ACE inhibition indicates that enzyme systems not reflected by plasma ACE activity or independent from the classic pathways of angiotensin formation contribute to the regulation of the autonomic response to ACE inhibition in patients with heart failure. The absence of significant change in hemodynamic variables or in blood pressure variability indicates that these autonomic changes are not an indirect reflex response to ACE inhibitor-induced vasodilation or hemodynamic baroreceptor stimulation.", 
    "80": "We studied an alteration of calcineurin expression in the heart and its modification by cyclosporin A and an ACE inhibitor, temocapril, using Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Calcineurin protein expression in the LV myocardium was increased in the LVH stage, but then decreased during CHF transition. Chronic cyclosporin A treatment (10 mg/kg/day), which inhibits calcineurin activity, could not block the increases of LV weight and dimensions and did not improve the LV systolic function during the CHF transition. In contrast, chronic temocapril treatment (20 mg/kg/day) restored the downregulation of calcineurin expression, but progression of the hypertrophic process was inhibited. Therefore, cardiac calcineurin is increased in the hypertensive LVH and may be involved in the development of the adaptive hypertrophic process. However, calcineurin expression is downregulated during CHF transition and may no longer play a major role in the pathogenesis of myocardial hypertrophy in the failing hearts.",

The hearts were then reperfused with blood in a modified Langendorff model for 60 min. Left ventricular function, myocardial blood flow, and arteriovenous differences in oxygen, glucose and lactate were monitored intraoperatively and during reperfusion. Two groups of hearts were studied. Group I (captopril treated, n = 9): the pigs were pre-medicated with increasing oral doses of captopril for 3 weeks (12.5 mg-150 mg daily) and an intravenous dose (25 mg) upon arrival at the laboratory. Captopril was added to the cardioplegia (1000 microg/l) and to the reperfusion media (1000 microg/l). Group II (controls, n = 8): the pigs were given no premedication, captopril-free cardioplegia and the hearts were reperfused with captopril-free blood. Captopril increased myocardial oxygen and glucose extraction during reperfusion (p < 0.05 for both) while lactate remained unchanged after 360 min HCS. Treatments with captopril increased developed left ventricular pressure (DLVP) and relaxation (-dP/dtmax) during reperfusion (p < 0.05 for both), while contractility (+dP/dtmax) was unchanged. Heart rate was reduced in captopril-treated hearts (p < 0.05) while myocardial blood flow (MBF) was similar in the two groups. Captopril administration prior to and during HCS and postcardioplegic reperfusion improves oxygen and glucose extraction in large spontaneously beating porcine hearts during reperfusion. The underlying mechanisms seem to involve metabolic modulation, since myocardial uptake of oxygen and glucose was increased in the absence of changes in myocardial blood flow.",

It has been suggested that both circulating and local myocardial renin-angiotensin systems play a role in mediating these responses. Here we describe the natural history of ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in the transgenic (mRen2)27 rat--a monogenetic model--which has a high tissue expression of the murine renin transgene, and suffers severe hypertension. We further explored the relative contribution of both hypertensive burden and circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin systems to the fibrotic process.", 
    "96": "The transgenic rats were treated from 28 days old with (1) a hypotensive dose of the ACE inhibitor ramipril which inhibited both tissue and circulating ACE activity, (2) the calcium antagonist amlodipine, or (3) a non-hypotensive dose of ramipril which inhibited about 60% of tissue ACE activity with little effect on circulating ACE. Normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats were used as controls.", 
    "97": "The transgenics developed left ventricular hypertrophy along with perivascular and interstitial fibrosis which became progressively worse up to 24 weeks of age. Both the high dose of ramipril and amlodipine prevented the hypertrophy and fibrosis, whereas tissue ACE inhibition without lowering blood pressure had no effect, and actually led to a worsening of the fibrosis by 24 weeks.", 
    "98": "These results suggest that the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in the transgenic (mRen2)27 rat are regulated by blood pressure and not activity of the renin-angiotensin systems and that progression of fibrosis at 24 weeks involves a mechanism unrelated to local renin-angiotensin activity.", 
    "99": "Heterogeneity in renal structure has been described in type 2 diabetic patients with both microalbuminuria and proteinuria; in fact, only a subset of type 2 diabetic patients have the typical diabetic glomerulopathy. However, it is currently unknown whether abnormalities in albumin excretion rate (AER) have a different renal prognostic value depending on the underlying renal structure. Aims of this study were: 1) to study the course of renal function in type 2 diabetic patients with altered AER; 2) to evaluate the relationship between the course of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal structure; and 3) to evaluate the relationship between the course of GFR and baseline AER levels, metabolic control, and blood pressure levels during a follow-up period of 4 years. A total of 108 type 2 diabetic patients, 74 with microalbuminuria (MA) and 34 with proteinuria (P), were recruited into a prospective study that encompassed: 1) a baseline kidney biopsy with morphometric measurements of glomerular parameters; 2) intensified antihypertensive treatment for an average 4-year period (blood pressure target <140/90 mmHg); and 3) determinations of GFR at baseline and every 6 months. Mean (+/- SD) GFR significantly decreased from baseline in both MA (-1.3+/-9.4 [95% CI -3.51 to +0.86], P < 0.05) and P (-3.0+/-13.0 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) per year [-7.71 to +1.61], P < 0.01). However, the changes in GFR were quite heterogeneous. Thus, on the basis of percent GFR change per year from baseline (delta%GFR), both MA and P patients were defined as progressors or nonprogressors when they were below or above the median, respectively. Baseline parameters of glomerular structure had a strong influence on the course of GFR. Indeed, the odds ratios of being progressors significantly increased across the quartiles of baseline glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width and mesangial fractional volume [Vv(mes/glom)], being 2.71 and 2.85 higher, respectively, in the fourth quartile than in the first quartile (P < 0.01 for both). Conversely, nonprogressors outnumbered progressors in the first quartile of GBM width (odds ratio: 2.14, P < 0.05) and in the first quartile of Vv(mes/glom) (odds ratio: 2.28, P < 0.01). Baseline albumin excretion rate (AER) did not influence delta%GFR; in fact, the number of progressors did not increase across quartiles of baseline AER among either MA or P. Similarly, mean blood pressure levels during follow-up (and intensified antihypertensive therapy) did not affect the course of GFR: the number of progressors and nonprogressors did not change across quartiles of mean blood pressure. In contrast, HbA1c during follow-up had an impact on delta%GFR: the odds ratio for being a progressor increased across quartiles of HbA1c, particularly for the highest quartile (HbA1c >9.0%). In conclusion, the course of renal function is heterogeneous in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria or proteinuria. In fact, a subset of patients has a rapid decline in GFR over a 4-year follow-up period; these patients have more advanced diabetic glomerulopathy and worse metabolic control than the remaining patients, whose GFR remains stable. These two cohorts are otherwise undistinguishable as regards the degree of AER at baseline and tight blood pressure control. Kidney biopsy has an important prognostic role in these patients. Thus, tight blood pressure control, when not associated with satisfactory glycemic control, is unable to prevent rapid GFR decline in type 2 diabetic patients with typical diabetic glomerulopathy.", 
    "100": "Diabetic glomerulosclerosis is defined by increased glomerular extracellular matrix (ECM) that is mainly synthesized by mesangial cells that underwent an activation mediated by cytokines and growth factors from various cellular origins. In this study, we tested whether macrophages could infiltrate the glomeruli and influence ECM synthesis in experimental diabetes. To test our hypothesis, we initially studied the dynamics of glomerular macrophage recruitment in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 30 by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on isolated glomeruli and immunohistochemistry and morphometry. We then assessed the role of macrophages on the basis of the pharmacological modulation of their recruitment by insulin or ACE inhibitor treatments and by X-irradiation-induced macrophage depletion at days 8 and 30. Macrophages were recruited within the glomeruli at the very early phase of hyperglycemia by using RT-PCR CD14 detection from day 2 and by using ED1 immunohistochemistry from day 8. This glomerular macrophage infiltration was associated with an increase in alpha1-chain type IV collagen mRNA. In parallel, the diabetic glomeruli became hypertrophic with an increase in the mesangial area. Macrophage recruitment was preceded by or associated with an increased glomerular expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, which contributes to monocyte diapedesis. Glomerular interleukin-1beta mRNA synthesis was also enhanced as early as day 1 and could be involved in the increase in ECM and adhesion molecule gene expressions. Insulin treatment and irradiation-induced macrophage depletion completely prevented the glomerular macrophage recruitment and decreased alpha1-chain type IV collagen mRNA and mesangial area in diabetic rats, whereas ACE inhibitor treatment had an incomplete effect. It can be concluded that in the streptozotocin model, hyperglycemia is followed by an early macrophage recruitment that contributes to the molecular and structural events that could lead to glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, besides direct stimulation of mesangial cells by hyperglycemia, macrophages recruited in the glomeruli during the early phase of hyperglycemia could secondarily act on mesangial cells.",

    "105": "Since the discovery of renin by Tigerstedt and Bergmann, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been recognized as an important modulator of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Based on these functions a pathophysiological role of the RAS in the pathogenesis of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders has been postulated. The therapeutic benefit of RAS inhibition by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (ANG II) antagonists in these conditions has been shown. It remains unclear, however, whether the changes in RAS activity associated with cardiovascular disease are primary or secondary factors. It is well known that hypertension and hypertensive end-organ disease is influenced by genetic factors. Gene polymorphisms for virtually all components of the RAS have been described and investigated in clinical studies. It remains to be determined, however, how relevant these findings are for disease etiology. This review, therefore, will attempt to discuss the causal implications of these genetic studies for cardiovascular disease. The role of angiotensinogen and ACE for hypertension, coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders is discussed in this context in an exemplary fashion.", 
    "106": "Enalapril, a long-acting inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was given for 2 years to seven children with Alport syndrome. Five patients had a classical X-linked form of the disease; two siblings had the autosomal recessive variant. Their age was between 5.15 and 13.75 years when enalapril was started. All patients had haematuria and proteinuria, creatinine clearance was > 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in all, and only one patient was hypertensive. The starting dose of enalapril (0.1 mg/kg body weight per day) was increased progressively according to individual clinical tolerance. The median doses were 0.13, 0.12, 0.21 and 0.29 mg/kg at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, respectively. Median values of mean blood pressure were 95 mmHg at the start and 84 mmHg after 24 months. Median daily proteinuria decreased from 52 mg/kg to 18 mg/kg at 6 months, 21 mg/kg at 12 months, 12 mg/kg at 18 months and 30 mg/kg at 24 months. Serum creatinine increased over time from a median of 0.64 mg/dl at baseline to 0.77 mg/dl at 24 months. Concomitantly, there was a decrease in GFR from 104 to 83 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at 18 months and an increase again to 95 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at 24 months.

    "108": "A cDNA clone, 1.8 kb long, was isolated from a venom gland cDNA library of Agkistrodon blomhoffi that encodes a large plurifunctional precursor composed of 263 amino-acid residues. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this clone revealed that sequences which code for blomhotin and a novel peptide Leu3-blomhotin are located in the N-terminal region of the precursor polypeptide, followed by four tandemly aligned sequences which code for three types of bradykinin-potentiating peptide. In the C-terminal region, the sequence for the C-type natriuretic peptide was located along with a preceding processing signal. The deduced amino-acid sequences for the four bradykinin-potentiating peptides coincided exactly with previously known sequences for potentiator B, potentiator C and potentiator E. The actual Leu3-blomhotin peptide was subsequently isolated from the venom of A. blomhoffi and characterized. Leu3-blomhotin possesses contractile activity in isolated rat stomach fundus smooth muscle in the same manner as blomhotin. Furthermore, it was shown that blomhotin and Leu3-blomhotin retained activity to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme.",

    "110": "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) regulates many genes involved in vascular physiopathology. We have previously observed in vivo NF-kappaB activation in injured vessels that diminished by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. In the present work, we investigated the effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on NF-kappaB activity in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, evaluating the molecular mechanisms and the specific receptor subtype involved. Ang II increased NF-kappaB DNA binding (5-fold, 10(-)(9) mol/L at 1 hour; electrophoretic mobility shift assay), nuclear translocation of p50/p65 subunits, and cytosolic inhibitor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) degradation. Ang II elicited NF-kappaB-mediated transcription (transfection of a reporter gene) and expression of NF-kappaB-related genes (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and angiotensinogen). AT(1) (DUP753) and AT(2) (PD123319 and CGP42112) receptor antagonists inhibited Ang II-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner ( approximately 85% for each one; 10(-)(5) mol/L at 1 hour). The AT(2) agonist p-aminophenylalanine(6)-Ang II augmented NF-kappaB binding (4.6-fold, 10(-)(9) mol/L at 1 hour), p65 nuclear levels, and transcription of an NF-kappaB reporter gene. AT(1) antagonist markedly inhibited NF-kappaB-mediated transcription and gene expression. Some differences between AT(1)/AT(2) intracellular signals were found. Antioxidants and ceramide inhibitors, but not protein kinase C inhibitors, diminished NF-kappaB activation elicited by both Ang II and the AT(2) agonist, while tyrosine kinase inhibitors only decreased Ang II-induced NF-kappaB activity. Our results demonstrate that Ang II activates NF-kappaB via AT(1) and AT(2), although NF-kappaB-mediated transcription occurred mainly through AT(1). Both receptors share some signaling pathways (oxygen radicals and ceramide); however, tyrosine kinases only participate in AT(1)/NF-kappaB responses. These data provide novel insights into Ang II actions, suggesting a potential implication of the AT(2) in the pathobiology of vascular cells.", 
    "111": "Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a cellular enzyme involved in glycolysis, binds specifically to several viral RNAs, but the functional significance of this interaction is uncertain. Both GAPDH and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) bind to overlapping sites in stem-loop IIIa of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of Hepatitis A virus (HAV), a picornavirus. Since the binding of GAPDH destabilizes the RNA secondary structure, we reasoned that GAPDH may suppress the ability of the IRES to direct cap-independent translation, making its effects antagonistic to the translation-enhancing activity of PTB (D. E. Schultz, C. C. Hardin, and S. M. Lemon, J. Biol. Chem. 271:14134-14142, 1996). To test this hypothesis, we constructed plasmids containing a dicistronic transcriptional unit in which the HAV IRES was placed between an upstream GAPDH-coding sequence and a downstream Renilla luciferase (RLuc) sequence. Transfection with this plasmid results in overexpression of GAPDH and in RLuc production as a measure of IRES activity. RLuc activity was compared with that from a control, null-expression plasmid that was identical except for a frameshift mutation within the 5' GAPDH coding sequence. In transfection experiments, GAPDH overexpression significantly suppressed HAV IRES activity in BSC-1 and FRhK-4 cells but not in Huh-7 cells, which have a significantly greater cytoplasmic abundance of PTB. GAPDH suppression of HAV translation was greater with the wild-type HAV IRES than with the IRES from a cell culture-adapted virus (HM175/P16) that has reproducibly higher basal translational activity in BSC-1 cells. Stem-loop IIIa RNA from the latter IRES had significantly lower affinity for GAPDH in filter binding experiments. Thus, the binding of GAPDH to the IRES of HAV suppresses cap-independent viral translation in vivo in African green monkey kidney cells. The enhanced replication capacity of cell culture-adapted HAV in such cells may be due in part to reduced affinity of the viral IRES for GAPDH.", 
    "112": "Rats recovering from acute renal ischemia exhibit tubule loss and interstitial fibrosis followed by development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis. The current study assessed the contribution of angiotensin II (AngII) to these processes. The contribution of AngII to early tubule loss and interstitial fibrosis was assessed in rats studied for 35 d after right nephrectomy and transient occlusion of the left renal artery. One group of rats received no treatment, while a second group received losartan beginning at 2 d following ischemia. Studies at 35 d showed that losartan did not improve GFR (2.04 +/- 0.30 ml/min treated, 2.16 +/- 0.21 ml/min untreated), reduce the fraction of glomeruli that were no longer connected to normal tubule segments (42 +/- 9% treated, 42 +/- 13% untreated), or limit expansion of the interstitial volume fraction (25 +/- 3% treated, 25 +/- 4% untreated). The contribution of AngII to progressive glomerular injury following initial recovery from ischemia was assessed in similarly prepared rats studied for 140 d. One group of rats received no treatment, while a second group received enalapril beginning at 35 d following ischemia. Enalapril markedly reduced proteinuria (78 +/- 17 mg/d treated, 229 +/- 52 mg/d untreated) and the prevalence of segmental glomerular sclerosis (14 +/- 9% treated, 45 +/- 10% untreated). Untreated rats developed sclerotic lesions in glomeruli not connected to normal tubules, as well as in glomeruli connected to normal tubules. Enalapril prevented injury in both classes of glomeruli. These results indicate that AngII does not contribute to interstitial fibrosis during recovery from ischemic injury. Reduction of AngII activity, can, however, prevent secondary glomerular injury in kidneys initially damaged by ischemia.", 
    "113": "We investigated whether the prevention of the development of diabetic nephropathy by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with decreases in renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and/or blood pressure in diabetic mice. C57Bl/6 mice were injected with streptozotocin (200 mg/kg, i.v.) and randomized to receive either imidapril (1 and 5 mg/kg) or captopril (10 and 50 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 28 days. Each assay was performed on 8-10 mice from each treatment. At 28 days after the start of drug treatment, imidapril and captopril significantly reduced blood pressure of the diabetic mice, and this effect of captopril was stronger than that of imidapril. On the other hand, inhibition of renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by imidapril was stronger than that by captopril. Imidapril and captopril dose-dependently inhibited urinary albumin excretion to similar extents, but they failed to inhibit the renal hypertrophy and elevation of creatinine clearance. Total renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was significantly reduced in diabetic mice, but immunohistochemical localization of angiotensin-converting enzyme was intensive in the vasculature and glomeruli of the diabetic kidney. In conclusion, both effects on blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity may be involved in the prevention of development of diabetic nephropathy by imidapril and captopril in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The data suggest that the degrees of contribution of their effects on blood pressure and renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity to the inhibition of urinary albumin excretion may be different between the two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

The frequency of ACE DD genotype in patients with diabetic nephropathy was significantly higher than in patients without nephropathy (22.3 vs 13.4%, P<0.05). To determine whether ACE gene polymorphism was associated with the severity of diabetic nephropathy, we divided patients with diabetic nephropathy into dialysis and non-dialysis groups.

The method employed acidification (with pH 4.0 sodium acetate buffer) of the serum samples to minimize the hydrolysis of the prodrug fosinopril to fosinoprilat prior to purification by automated 96-well solid-phase extraction. The required chromatographic separation of fosinoprilat and fosinopril was achieved isocratically on a Luna C8 analytical column (2 x 50 mm, 3 microm). The total run time was 2 min. The mobile phase contained methanol and water with 10 mM ammonium acetate. Detection was by positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The standard curve, which ranged from 2.00 to 500 ng/mL, was fitted to a 1/x(2) weighted linear regression model. Fosinoprilat quality control (QC) samples used to determine the accuracy and precision of the method were prepared in human serum at concentrations of 5.00, 200, 400 and 1000 ng/mL.

Intensive therapy demonstrated a lower overall incidence of deaths, 5.5 vs. 10.7%, P = 0.037. Over a 5-year follow-up period, there was no difference between the intensive and moderate groups with regard to the progression of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. In addition, the use of nisoldipine versus enalapril had no differential effect on diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.", 
    "131": "Blood pressure control of 138/86 or 132/78 mmHg with either nisoldipine or enalapril as the initial antihypertensive medication appeared to stabilize renal function in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients without overt albuminuria over a 5-year period. The more intensive blood pressure control decreased all-cause mortality.", 
    "132": "Whether ACE inhibition is useful for type 2 diabetic patients with micro- and macroalbuminuria remains unknown. The Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria, Cardiovascular Events and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) Study was set up to address this issue through a multicenter double-blind parallel placebo-controlled > or = 3-year trial in Europe and North Africa. In this article, we report the characteristics of the randomized patients.", 
    "133": "The main selection criteria were as follows: men or women aged > or = 50 years with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs, with or without hypertension, with a plasma creatinine level < 150 mumol/l, and with persistent micro- or macroalbuminuria, as assessed centrally by two successive urine samples containing a urinary albumin concentration > or = 20 mg/l. Patient characteristics were studied by comparing patients who were randomized to those who were not, taking their geographical origin into account.", 
    "134": "There were 25,455 patients screened for urinary albumin (20,296 from France, 918 from Germany, 1,019 from Northwest Europe, 969 from Central Europe, 959 from Mediterranean Europe, and 1,294 from North Africa). Of these patients, 4,937 were randomized. Compared with the nonrandomized patients, the randomized patients were older, more often men, more obese, had higher systolic/diastolic blood pressure and plasma glucose, smoked more tobacco, drank more alcohol, and had complications more frequently. Using a logistic regression analysis, all the above-mentioned items appeared as independent determinants for randomization into the study, with the exception of alcohol intake. The contribution of each item varied slightly from one geographical origin to another.", 
    "135": "The physical, biological, and behavioral characteristics create a poor renal and cardiovascular prognosis for the type 2 diabetic patients randomized to the DIABHYCAR Study because of micro- and macroalbuminuria. Testing the usefulness of ACE inhibition for the type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria seems feasible through the DIABHYCAR Study.", 
    "136": "Administration of beta-blockers reduces mortality among old persons during and after acute myocardial infarction. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that persons without contraindications to use of beta-blockers should be administered beta-blockers within a few days of myocardial infarction (if administration is not initiated acutely) and that their administration should be continued indefinitely. These guidelines also recommend the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in treating persons within the first 24 h of suspected onset of acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation in two or more anterior precordial leads or with congestive heart failure in the absence of significant hypotension or other contraindications to use of ACE inhibitors; and persons during and after convalescence from acute myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure associated with an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a LVEF < 40%. These guidelines state that there are no class I indications for using calcium antagonists after myocardial infarction. If patients have persistent angina pectoris after myocardial infarction despite treatment with beta-blockers and nitrates or hypertension inadequately controlled by other drugs, administration of a nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist such as verapamil or diltiazem should be added to the therapeutic regimen if the LVEF is normal. If the LVEF is abnormal, administration of amlodipine or felodipine should be added to the therapeutic regimen.", 
    "137": "The treatment of congestive heart failure focuses on three steps: 1. Elimination of the precipitating cause or mechanism, and/or treatment of the underlying disease respectively. 2. Treatment of the failing heart syndrome itself. We shall concern ourselves with pharmacotherapy, omitting technical and surgical aspects. 3. Prophylactic treatment of complications, such as thromboembolism and arrhythmias. Drugs for the treatment of heart failure can be classified as follows: 1. Diuretics 2. Vasodilators 3. Neurohumoral Inhibitors 4. Inotropic drugs. Diuretics improve symptoms and exercise capacity and probably survival. They are the drug of first choice in acute and chronic heart failure. Potassium supplementation is necessary. Renal function needs to be monitored. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone has probably important effects upon the myocardium. It retards fibrous tissue development and improves prognosis. Vasodilators unload the heart and improve contractile geometry and hemodynamics, thereby lessening symptoms. Prognosis, however, is not affected. They are indispensable in acute heart failure. In longterm treatment only the combination of nitrates with hydralazin has been shown to be effective. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors combine vasodilation with neurohumoral inhibition. They are most effective in improving symptoms, exercise capacity and surviving chronic heart failure. If side effects (cough, allergy) prevent their use, then angiotensin II receptor antagonists can be used with equal benefit. However, both groups of drugs impair renal function and cannot be given in advanced renal failure or renal artery stenosis. Beta-receptor antagonists, previously considered contraindicated in heart failure are today amongst the most important drugs in heart failure. They improve survival and retard the need for cardiac transplantation in advanced failure. Their use, however, is rather difficult requiring extremely slow dose titration beginning with very low doses. Inotropic drugs are today mainly used in acute failure and cardiogenic shock. In longterm treatment only the digitalisglycosides have been shown to be effective in improving symptoms, exercise capacity and the general clinical course. Often antiarrhythmic treatment is necessary. Here amiodarone is the drug of choice today if beta blockers do not suffice. Prophylactic anticoagulation is indicated in all cases NYHA III and IV, with large hearts already in II. Future developments may include new inotropes, the ANP-system, and cytokines, as well as gene therapy for correction of myocardial phenotype change.", 
    "138": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors protect the hearts of patients with different levels of cardiac disorder. The greatest benefit seems to be achieved in subjects with most severe heart failure. Moreover, ACE inhibition is protective also in patients without manifested heart failure but with severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Data are presented that ACE inhibitors can alter the composition of the myocardium also in control: healthy animals. In rats and rabbits with non-diseased heart, chronic ACE inhibition reduced fibrotic tissue concentration in the left ventricle. We speculate that if this were applied to humans, ACE inhibition may prove to be of potential benefit in subjects with normal systolic function but with a trend to left ventricular filling abnormalities caused by increased ventricular stiffness. In these patients reduction of myocardial fibrotic tissue might prevent deterioration of diastolic function.", 
    "139": "Previous studies showed that the transport of enalapril occurred homogeneously among zonal rat hepatocytes. However, the metabolism of hepatic arterially delivered enalapril, swept into the rat liver by the portal or hepatic venous flow (HAPV and HAHV perfusion), was more abundant in the perivenous (PV) than the periportal (PP) region. Hence, metabolic activities toward enalapril in 9000g supernatant (S9) fractions of enriched rat PP and PV hepatocytes were examined. Although Michaelis-Menten kinetics were invariably observed, the metabolic activity toward enalapril (intrinsic clearance or V(max)(met)/K(m)(met) of 0.008 ml/min/mg of S9 protein, V(max)(met) of 21 +/- 6 nmol/min/mg of S9 protein, and K(m)(met) of 2612 +/- 236 microM) was greater in PV than in PP (V(max)(met) of 5.5 +/- 3.1 nmol/min/mg of S9 protein and K(m)(met) of 1049 +/- 335 microM; intrinsic clearance of 0.0052 ml/min/mg of S9 protein) hepatocytes. These metabolic intrinsic clearances were much lower than the sinusoidal influx clearances observed from previous transport studies, revealing metabolism as the rate-limiting step. Substitution of the scaled-up transport and metabolic intrinsic clearances into the \"well stirred\", \"parallel-tube\", and \"dispersion\" models predicted higher steady-state extraction ratios for HAHV perfusion. By contrast, integration of the scaled-up in vitro parameters on zonal metabolism and homogeneous transport into a \"zonal-compartment\" model of three zonal subcompartments (1, 2, and 3) provided an improved description of the extraction ratios during HAPV and HAHV. Zonal factors are important for the scale-up of data in vitro to the whole organ.", 
    "140": "Sinusoidal entry is the first obligatory process preceding intracellular drug removal in liver. Transport of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (1-750 microM with [(3)H]enalapril), a substrate of Oatp1, the sodium-independent organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 cloned from rat liver, was studied in rat hepatocytes isolated from all zones of the liver (homogeneous) and from enriched periportal (PP) and perivenous (PV) hepatocytes prepared by collagenase perfusion and zone-selective destruction with digitonin, respectively. Uptake was linear over 1 min and was concentration-dependent. Transport by the homogeneous hepatocytes (in the presence and absence of Na(+)) and PP and PV cells was described by single saturable components of similar kinetic constants (K(m) values of 344-461 microM and V(max) values of 9.5-11.6 nmol/min/10(6) cells; P >.05, ANOVA). The K(m) value for enalapril uptake in hepatocytes was of the same order of magnitude compared with that for Oatp1 expressed in HeLa cells transfected with cDNA-Oatp1 and Western blot analysis revealed similar levels of immunoreactive Oatp1 expression in PP and PV hepatocytes. However, enalapril was not taken up by Oatp2 nor by the human OATP expressed in recombinant vaccinia systems.", 
    "141": "The diagnosis of acute myocarditis in children is based on histological criteria. Often viral in origin, it results in acute left ventricular dysfunction, the clinical manifestations of which are very variable. The potential severity of the disease is maximal in its initial phase, justifying rapid and intensive treatment. Long-term outcome is relatively good although there is a risk of chronic left ventricular dysfunction. This retrospective study is based on 11 cases of acute myocarditis admitted to the paediatric unit of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital between February 1989 and March 1999. The initial symptoms were non-specific. Echocardiography was the key diagnostic procedure. Half of the patients had severe cardiac failure requiring admission to the intensive care unit. Four cases presented with a severe complication: two embolic events, one syncopal atrioventricular block and one cardiac arrest. The cardiac treatment was classical (digitalis, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulants). The aetiology was established in 3 cases (toxoplasmosis, haemolytic and uraemic syndrome, Kawasaki) and a viral cause was suspected in 6 other cases (adenovirus in 3 cases, herpes virus, RSV and enterovirus in 1 case). There were no deaths in the acute phase. The long-term outcome was globally good: complete regression in 8 cases, 1 chronic left ventricular dysfunction and 2 late deaths due to intractable cardiac failure. This short series illustrates the often misleading presentation of acute myocarditis in childhood, the value of systematic investigation in the hope of a specific treatment becoming available in the near future for the often viral aetiology.", 
    "142": "This is a summary of reports of presentation made at the American College of Cardiology 49th Scientific Sessions, Anaheim, 12-15 March 2000. Studies with a particular interest for heart failure physicians have been reviewed. OPTIME-CHF: Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure. OPTIME-CHF was a randomised-controlled trial comparing a 48-h infusion of Milrinone or standard therapy in 951 patients recruited over a 2-year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator believed their clinical condition mandated inotropic therapy. Patients were randomised within 48 h of admission for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure to receive Milrinone or placebo infision for 48 h. Of the patients 43% were diabetics, 70% were receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 25% were already on a beta-Blocker, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay during the index admission, subsequent readmissions and days in hospital over the following 60 days. Subjective clinical assessment scores were also no different. There was an average admission rate over the next year of one per patient in both groups. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of sustained hypotension in the Milrinone group, which accounted for all of the increased adverse event rates for the active therapy. The 60-day mortality was 10% in both groups. This and previous trials of the oral formulation of Milrinone have now clearly demonstrated a lack of benefit with Milrinone in either during acute exacerbations of or in stable severe chronic heart failure [Packer M, Carver JR, Rodeheffer RJ et al. Effect of oral Milrinone on mortality in severe chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1991;325:1468-1475.]. Medium sized studies of Milrinone in patients with milder severities of heart failure also suggested an adverse impact on prognosis in the presence or absence of digoxin [DiBianco R, Shabetai R, Kostuk W, Moran J, Schlant RC, Wright R. A comparison of oral Milrinone, digoxin, and their combination in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1989;320:677-683.]. Whether Milrinone even has a role for the management of a haemodyamic crisis requiring inotropic therapy must also be questioned.",

    "146": "Two hundred and fifty-eight patients were identified with heart failure. Prevalence was 1.1%. Fifty percent were on an ACE inhibitor, the mean dose of which was less than half the typical research dose. Patients who had an echocardiogram were much more likely to be on an ACE inhibitor. General practitioners were enthusiastic to use ACE inhibitors, but felt that greater access to echocardiography was required. Hospital physicians were happy to improve access within an agreed protocol.", 
    "147": "Improved uptake of ACE inhibitors could be assisted by the development of a protocol for investigation and treatment. This protocol should be evidence-based and agreed between local GPs, hospital physicians and the Health Authority.", 
    "148": "The efficacy of ACE-inhibitor therapy is well documented in the treatment of chronic heart failure. As pharmacological mechanisms of ACE-inhibition and angiotensin II AT1-receptor-antagonists differ, an additional positive effect concerning left ventricular function can be expected in combining both classes of drugs.", 
    "149": "Twenty patients (64.9+/-8.5 years) with advanced chronic heart failure (NYHA class III) receiving long-term medication with digitalis, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors were randomized to either eprosartan (540+/-96 mg/day) or placebo, according to a blinded protocol. Hemodynamic measurements by impedance cardiography were performed at baseline and after 8.85+/-1. 5 days of study medication treatment.", 
    "150": "Additional treatment with eprosartan resulted in a higher cardiac output than in the control group (P<0.05). While in the active treatment group cardiac output increased significantly from baseline (2.27-3.24 l/min, P=0. 039), there was no change in the control group.", 
    "151": "The additional treatment with the AT1-receptor antagonist eprosartan, given to severe heart failure patients, who received digitalis, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, resulted in a beneficial effect by increasing cardiac output. This effect may be due to eprosartan's additional property of blocking the autocrine interaction of locally and not ACE-generated angiotensin II with their respective vascular and myocardial AT1-receptors as well as the influence on prejunctional AT1-receptors located on sympathetic nerve terminals.",

Patients will be interviewed subsequent to hospital discharge to assess their understanding of their condition, side effects from and their compliance with therapy and their satisfaction with the management for heart failure. The quality of management will be judged against the recommendations contained in the ESC guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of heart failure.

    "156": "Cyclosporine A causes hypertension and nephrotoxicity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In the present study, arterial function was investigated using in vitro vascular preparations after long-term treatment with cyclosporine A. SHR received cyclosporine A (5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) s.c.) and high-Na(+) diet for 6 weeks during the developmental phase of hypertension. Part of the rats were treated concomitantly either with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) p.o.) or with an angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist valsartan (3 or 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) p.o.). In renal arteries, contractile responses to noradrenaline and angiotensin II, as well as relaxation responses to acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent) and to sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent), were severely impaired by cyclosporine A-treatment. There was also a trend for the dysfunction of the mesenteric arteries, but the impairment did not reach statistical difference. Enalapril and valsartan improved the impaired renal arterial functions. Cyclosporine A-induced hypertension and nephrotoxicity seem to be associated with renal arterial dysfunction in SHR on high-Na(+) diet. Antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system protects from vascular toxicity of cyclosporine A.", 
    "157": "The vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat inhibits both neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potency of omapatrilat and the specific ACE inhibitor fosinopril toward the 2 active sites of ACE (called N- and C-domains) was investigated with the use of 3 substrates: angiotensin I, which is equally cleaved by the 2 ACE domains; hippuryl-histidyl-leucine, specific synthetic substrate of the C-domain in high- salt conditions; and a newly synthesized specific substrate of the N-domain designed by acetylating the lysine residue of AcSDKP. In vitro, omapatrilat was 5 times more potent than fosinoprilat in inhibiting angiotensin I hydrolysis. Omapatrilat inhibited similarly both N- and C-domain hydrolysis, whereas fosinoprilat was slightly more specific for the N-domain. The in vivo selective inhibitory potency of single oral doses of 10 mg omapatrilat and 20 mg fosinopril were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 9 mildly sodium-depleted normotensive subjects. In accordance with the in vitro results, fosinopril appeared to be more specific for the N-domain than the C-domain in vivo, since plasma and urine AcSDKP concentrations were significantly higher than those observed with omapatrilat. This study shows that it is possible to assess separately in vitro and in vivo the selectivity of ACE or ACE/neutral endopeptidase inhibitors. A differential selectivity may explain some peculiar properties observed with some ACE inhibitors.", 
    "158": "The antihypertensive agent omapatrilat represents a novel approach to antihypertensive therapy, namely vasopeptidase inhibition. Omapatrilat (BMS-186716) concomitantly inhibits neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme, leading to protection from degradation of natriuretic and other hypotensive peptides in addition to interruption of the renin-angiotensin system. Although the potency of omapatrilat on reduction of blood pressure has been reported, its effects on resistance artery structure and function were unknown. We tested omapatrilat in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), a malignant model of hypertension, with the hypothesis that it would improve the structure and endothelial function of mesenteric resistance arteries. Ten-week-old SHRSP were treated orally for 10 weeks with omapatrilat (40 mg/kg per day). Mesenteric arteries (lumen <300 microm) were studied on a pressurized myograph. After 10 weeks, untreated SHRSP had a systolic blood pressure of 230+/-2 mm Hg that was significantly reduced (P<0.05) by omapatrilat (145+/-3 mm Hg). Omapatrilat treatment improved endothelium-dependent relaxation of resistance arteries as elicited by acetylcholine (10(-5) mol/L) but had no significant effect on endothelium-independent relaxation produced by a nitric oxide donor (sodium nitroprusside). This suggested that there existed endothelial dysfunction in SHRSP that was corrected by vasopeptidase inhibition, probably in part caused by the potent blood pressure-lowering effect of omapatrilat. Media width and media/lumen ratio were significantly decreased (P<0.05) by omapatrilat, and a trend (P=0.07) to increase lumen diameter was observed. Vascular stiffness (slope of the elastic modulus versus stress curve) was unaltered by omapatrilat. In conclusion, omapatrilat, acting as a potent antihypertensive agent, may improve structure and endothelial function of resistance arteries in SHRSP, a severe form of genetic hypertension.", 
    "159": "Inotropic responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation is generally found to be impaired in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and failure. To investigate the mechanisms by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may modulate inotropic responsiveness with long-term pressure overload, we studied the effects of captopril treatment on cardiac gene expression, LV muscle mechanical contraction, and intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) transients from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). LV papillary muscles from untreated SHR, age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and SHR treated with captopril (CAP(Rx) started at 12, 18, and 21 months of age) were studied. All animals were studied at 24 months of age or when heart failure developed. In untreated SHR, alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene expression and protein were decreased, the Ca(2+) transient (with the bioluminescent indicator aequorin) was prolonged, and abundance of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger mRNA levels increased in comparison to WKY. Active stress development at L(max) and the maximum rate of stress development were depressed and contractile duration prolonged in SHR relative to WKY. Isoproterenol administration further decreased active stress in untreated SHR despite an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels. In CAP(Rx) SHR, alpha-MHC gene expression and protein levels were increased, the Ca(2+) transient was not prolonged, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger expression was downregulated, and papillary muscle function demonstrated increased active stress and maximum rate of stress development in response to isoproterenol. The increased abundance of alpha-MHC mRNA in conjunction with an increase in V(1) myosin isozyme suggests that captopril affects transcriptional regulation of cardiac gene expression. Restored LV inotropic responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation in CAP(Rx) SHR appears to be coupled to normalization of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger mRNA expression, upregulation of V(1) myosin isozyme levels, and increased speed of contraction.", 
    "160": "The importance of angiotensin II in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance in sheep is questionable. In this trial the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor were quantified in sheep on restricted water intake. Comparing the phase of water restriction only with that of water restriction plus ACE inhibition, significant increases were observed during the latter phase in urine volume, sodium and potassium excretion via the urine, sodium concentration in the plasma and osmolar clearance. Urine osmolarity decreased with inhibition of angiotensin II formation while variables such as water, sodium and potassium loss via the faeces were unaffected. Most of the renal effects of ACE inhibition, except the increase in urinary potassium excretion, were explicable in terms of the established functions of angiotensin II. Furthermore, results of this trial indicate that angiotensin II has no significant effect on the intestine in regulating water and electrolyte excretion via the faeces.", 
    "161": "Renal medullary blood flow is important in blood pressure regulation and is surprisingly unaffected by the vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin II (Ang II). This study tested if the effect of Ang II on the renal papillary circulation is modulated by bradykinins, prostaglandins or NO (NO). In anaesthetised Wistar rats, total renal blood flow (RBF) was measured, as was cortical (CBF) and papillary (PBF) blood flow, using the laser-Doppler technique, in responses to Ang II (30 ng kg(-1) min(-1)) alone and after ACE inhibition (enalapril) or bradykinin/prostaglandin synthesis inhibition (ketoprofen, aprotinin). PBF was also measured after blockade of NO formation with or without pretreatment with an Ang II receptor antagonist (losartan).", 
    "162": "(i) PBF did not change in response to Ang II infusion but MAP increased (+ 10%) and RBF and CBF decreased. (ii) Treatment with aprotinin and ketoprofen left MAP, RBF and CBF unchanged but decreased PBF. Ang II did not decrease PBF further but a significant increase in MAP was seen. (iii) Enalapril treatment left PBF unchanged but decreased MAP and increased RBF and CBF. When Ang II was infused PBF and MAP increased markedly. (iv) L-NAME reduced PBF independently of losartan treatment.", 
    "163": "Bradykinin and prostaglandins do not appear to cause the lack of renal papillary vasoconstriction to Ang II. However, the increase in PBF to Ang II seen after enalapril treatment suggests that enalapril treatment, possibly via its effects on kinin breakdown and subsequent NO formation, might affect the sensitivity of renal papillary autoregulation. This may be an important aspect of the blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitors.",

    "172": "Of 350 consecutive patients without previous symptoms of coronary artery disease, admitted to hospital with an acute myocardial infarction, 109 of them (31%) reported a history of previous hypertension. Hypertensive patients were older than their normotensive counterparts, more of them were females, and thrombolytic treatment was administered to significantly fewer. Blood pressure values at admission to hospital were higher in hypertensive patients; this difference was significant in hypertensive males. Altogether 44 out of 49 female (90%) and 42 out of 60 male hypertensive patients (70%) reported using antihypertensive medication. A previous history of hypertension did not change infarct size as assessed by peak enzyme levels, neither in the bivariate nor in the multivariate analysis. In contrast to this, the adjusted odds ratio for developing a non-Q-wave infarct was 2.51 (p=0.003), i.e. the chance of developing a non-Q-wave infarct in hypertensives was increased by 151%. Thus, in spite of similar infarct size in normotensive and hypertensive patients, a relative smaller proportion of the probably hypertrophied left ventricular wall developed necrosis in the hypertensive population. The propensity towards non-Q-wave infarctions may contribute to the observed less use of fibrinolytic drug treatment in the presently observed patients with hypertension.",

Left ventricular posterior wall and septal thickness were significantly and similarly reduced in all groups. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic end diameters were not significantly changed. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was significantly reduced in E plus I group and enalapril group. GFR was not significantly altered.

    "176": "5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a precursor of porphyrins and heme that has been implicated in the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with porphyrias. It is also being used clinically to delineate malignant gliomas. The blood-CSF barrier may be an important interface for 5-ALA transport between blood and brain as in vivo studies have indicated 5-ALA is taken up by the choroid plexuses whereas the normal blood-brain barrier appears to be relatively impermeable. This study examines the mechanisms of 5-[(3)H]ALA uptake into isolated rat lateral ventricle choroid plexuses. Results suggest that there are two uptake mechanisms. The first was a Na(+)-independent uptake system that was pH dependent (being stimulated at low pH). Uptake was inhibited by the dipeptide Gly-Gly and by cefadroxil, an alpha-amino-containing cephalosporin. These properties are the same as the proton-dependent peptide transporters PEPT1 and PEPT2, which have recently been shown to transport 5-ALA in frog oocyte expression experiments. Choroid plexus uptake was not inhibited by captopril, a PEPT1 inhibitor, suggesting PEPT2-mediated uptake. The presence of PEPT2 and absence of PEPT1 in the choroid plexus were confirmed by western blotting. The second potential mechanism was both Na(+) and HCO(3)(-) dependent and appears to be an organic anion transporter, although it is possible that removal of Na(+) and HCO(3)(-) may indirectly affect PEPT2 by affecting intracellular pH. The presence of PEPT2 and a putative Na(+)/HCO(3)(-)-dependent organic anion transporter is important not only for an understanding of 5-ALA movement between blood and brain but also because these transporters may affect the distribution of a number of drugs between blood and CSF.",

In various ways they differ from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Until outcome data are available, they should continue to be used primarily in patients who should receive an ACEI but cannot tolerate the drug because of cough.", 
    "178": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) represent a new class of effective and well tolerated orally active antihypertensive agents. Recent clinical trials have shown the added benefits of ARBs in hypertensive patients (reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in diastolic function, decrease in ventricular arrhythmias, reduction in microalbuminuria, and improvement in renal function), and cardioprotective effect in patients with heart failure. Several large long-term studies are in progress to assess the beneficial effects of ARBs on cardiac hypertrophy, renal function, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with or without diabetes mellitus, and the value of these drugs in patients with heart disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs specifically block the interaction of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, thereby relaxing smooth muscle, increasing salt and water excretion, reducing plasma volume, and decreasing cellular hypertrophy. These agents exert their blood pressure-lowering effect mainly by reducing peripheral vascular resistance usually without a rise in heart rate. Most of the commercially available ARBs control blood pressure for 24 h after once daily dosing. Sustained efficacy of blood pressure control, without any evidence of tachyphylaxis, has been demonstrated after long-term administration (3 years) of some of the ARBs. The efficacy of ARBs is similar to that of thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers in patients with similar degree of hypertension. Higher daily doses, dietary salt restriction, and concomitant diuretic or ACE inhibitor administration amplify the antihypertensive effect of ARBs. The ARBs have a low incidence of adverse effects (headache, upper respiratory infection, back pain, muscle cramps, fatigue and dizziness), even in the elderly patients. After the approval of losartan, five other ARBs (candesartan cilexetil, eprosartan, irbesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan) and three combinations with hydrochlorothiazide (irbesartan, losartan and valsartan) have been approved as antihypertensive agents, and some 28 compounds are in various stages of development. The ARBs are non-peptide compounds with varied structures; some (candesartan, losartan, irbesartan, and valsartan) have a common tetrazolo-biphenyl structure. Except for irbesartan, all active ARBs have a carboxylic acid group. Candesartan cilexetil is a prodrug, while losartan has a metabolite (EXP3174) which is more active than the parent drug. No other metabolites of ARBs contribute significantly to the antihypertensive effect. The variation in the molecular structure of the ARBs results in differences in the binding affinity to the receptor and pharmacokinetic profiles. The differences observed in lipid solubility, absorption/distribution, plasma protein binding, bioavailability, biotransformation, plasma half-life, and systemic elimination influence the time of onset, duration of action, and efficacy of the ARBs. On the basis of the daily mg dose, the antihypertensive potency of the ARBs follows the sequence: candesartan cilexetil > telmisartan approximately = losartan > irbesartan approximately = valsartan > eprosartan. After oral administration, the ARBs are rapidly absorbed (time for peak plasma levels = 0.5-4 h) but they have a wide range of bioavailability (from a low of 13% for eprosartan to a high of 60-80% for irbesartan); food does not influence the bioavailability, except for valsartan (a reduction of 40-50%) and eprosartan (increase). A limited dose-peak plasma levels/areas under the plasma level-time curve proportionality is observed for some of the ARBs. Most of these drugs have high plasma protein binding (95-100%); irbesartan has the lowest binding among the group (90%). The steady-state volumes of distribution vary from a low of 9 L (candesartan) to a high of 500 L (telmisartan). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATE", 
    "179": "Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AT-1) represent a new group of orally active antihypertensive agents. Activation on AT-1 receptor leads to vasoconstriction, stimulation of the release of catecholamines and antidiuretic hormone with production of thirst, and promote growth of vascular and cardiac muscle; these effects are blocked by AT-1 antagonist agents. The first chemically useful, orally active AT-1 receptor antagonist was losartan, followed by other agents currently in clinical use, such as: valsartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, telmisartan, candesartan, and many others under investigation. AT-1 receptor antagonists are effective in reducing high blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Monotherapy in mild to moderate hypertension controls blood pressure in 40 to 50% of these patients; when a low dose of a thiazide diuretic is added, 60 to 70% of patients are controlled. The efficacy is similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, calcium antagonists and beta-blocking agents. Tolerability has been reported to be very good. AT-1 receptor antagonists would be a drug of choice in otherwise well-controlled hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors who developed cough or angioedema. The final position in the antihypertensive therapy in this special population and other clinical situations, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and renal disease, has to be determined in large prospective clinical trials, some of which are now being conducted.", 
    "180": "After a slow start, beta-blockers have become widely used as first-line agents in the treatment of hypertension, and recommended as such in recently published guidelines. There is evidence that the beta1-selective agents are more efficacious than non-selective blockers that inhibit both beta1 and beta2 receptors. Notwithstanding some earlier evidence to the contrary, it appears that beta1-selective drugs are equi-effective in young and elderly whites, younger, ie, under mid 60s, blacks. It is with the combination of age and being black that beta-blockers are usually less useful than some other groups of antihypertensive drugs, most notably calcium antagonists and diuretics. Primary prevention studies indicate beta-blockers reduce the incidence of cerebro-vascular disease and coronary heart disease in younger patients but they appear less effective than diuretics in the elderly. Beta-blockers are particularly indicated in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction where they are often under used. There is some evidence that even in post-infarction patients with co-existent chronic obstructive airways disease, usually regarded as a contra-indication, experience an improved 2-year survival with the use of beta-blockers. Recently they have also been demonstrated to improve prognosis in heart failure patients, previously regarded as a contra-indication. Likewise, recent studies have shown that atenolol was at least as effective as captopril in improving the outlook in hypertensive patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes. While earlier comparisons with the non-selective lipid soluble propranolol indicated otherwise, comparisons with beta1-selective agents have indicated a similar effect on quality of life assessments with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "181": "Control of hypertension and treatment of concomitant pathophysiologic conditions require use of multiple drugs in more than half of all patients. Unfortunately, most studies dealing with cardiovascular effects of antihypertensive drugs have focused on monotherapy. Thus, our knowledge of combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension is, to a great extent, extrapolation from monotherapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with calcium antagonists should be particularly efficacious in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy. Drug classes that either stimulate the renin-angiotensin system or the sympathetic nervous system are less likely to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy and should be avoided. In hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction, beta-blockers should be combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, whereas in the postmyocardial ischemia patient, verapamil and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may exert some additional beneficial effects with regard to reinfarction rates. Some of the undesirable metabolic side-effects of diuretics can be mitigated by the addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker. Given that two drugs when used separately are beneficial in a disorder does not necessarily mean that their combination is equally or even more beneficial. Sometimes combination therapy is used to counteract different limbs of pathophysiologic cascade operative in hypertensive patients with complications or comorbidities.", 
    "182": "Recent studies demonstrated that target blood pressure (BP) in treated hypertensive patients should be below 140 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and below 90 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). However, population studies from several countries have demonstrated that in clinical practice the proportion of controlled hypertensive patients is less than 30%. In order to elucidate these questions in France we analysed a large population of 145,000 subjects examined at the Centre d'Investigations Pr\u00e9ventives et Cliniques in Paris (IPC). Among those with high BP at the time of their IPC visit, only 20% received an antihypertensive treatment. Among those receiving an antihypertensive treatment, less than 27% (24% in men and 30% in women) presented with BP values less than 140 mmHg for SBP and less than 90 mmHg for DBP. This analysis also showed that 72% of hypertensive patients presented with at least one modifiable associated cardiovascular risk factor and that more than 30% of hypertensive men and more than 25% of hypertensive women presented with at least two associated risk factors. The use of combination therapies could help to increase the percentage of well-controlled hypertensive subjects. It has been shown that in order to reach this BP level, combination therapy should be used in more than two-thirds of the treated subjects. The trandolapril-verapamil combination is the first fixed combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker. Administered once daily, this combination reduces BP more than a classic monotherapy. The effects of the trandolapril-verapamil combination on risk factors are either neutral (metabolic parameters), or even beneficial (reduction in heart rate).", 
    "183": "The case for antihypertensive drug regimens that produce consistent 24-h blood pressure control has largely been founded upon a series of epidemiological observations that were either cross-sectional or alternatively relatively small-scale follow-up studies. More recent data have unequivocally demonstrated, in a prospective study in hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy, that the reduction in left ventricular mass index during the course of one year's antihypertensive treatment, was predicted much more closely by treatment-induced changes in ambulatory blood pressure than by changes in clinic blood pressure. This provides definitive and confirmatory data to support the aim of achieving blood pressure control, which is based upon a smooth and consistent antihypertensive effect over a full 24-h dosage interval. Regimens which provide such control may also offer the advantage of a sustained duration of effect beyond 24 h. This characteristic is attractive because even the most compliant patient may inadvertently miss at least one dose of medication each week. Evidence from a number of studies which have sought to mimic this pattern of suboptimal compliance by deliberately inserting a placebo phase into a steady-state treatment regimen, has clearly demonstrated the benefits of antihypertensive drugs with intrinsically long duration of action. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that following cessation of therapy there is a biphasic reversion of blood pressure towards baseline levels with a maintenance of a residual effect which is more pronounced with a long-acting agent when compared to a shorter-acting drug from the same therapeutic class. There is increasing evidence, albeit not derived from prospective outcome studies, that indicates that the benefits of antihypertensive therapy are likely to be maximized by treatment regimens which result in sustained blood pressure control.",

We carried out a six-month prospective study of 23 stable patients who had been on haemodialysis for at least one year to attempt to evaluate those factors modifying the dose of the hormone to attain a similar haematocrit, such as use or not of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, hepatitis C virus positive or negative, age older or younger than 60 years, acquired cystic kidney disease or not, and sex. The patients were treated with subcutaneaous erythropoietin for over a year to attain a haematocrit of 35%, intravenous iron to reach plasma ferritin levels > 250 ng/ml and a transferrin saturation index > 20%, folic acid and group B vitamins. Parameters studied included age, time and duration of haemodialysis, Kt/V, albumin, haematocrit, erythropoietin in U/kg/week, intact PTH, hepatitis C virus, PCR of the hepatitis C virus, transaminases, ferritin, transferrin saturation index, folic acid, vitamin B12, and aluminium. No statistically significant differences were seen between the patients with and without hepatitis or in age or acquired cystic kidney disease and sex in the hormone dose given to achieve similar levels of haematocrit. Higher doses of erythropoietin were necessary in those patients treated with antihypertensive agents (71 +/- 25 vs 44 +/- 25 U/kg/week; p < 0.05). There were no differences between groups in factors known to cause resistance to the action of the hormone. The most important conclusions from this study concern the cost-benefit relation of treating hypertensive patients on haemodialysis with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and erythropoietin.", 
    "198": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition attenuates pulmonary hypertension and delays the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling in animal models. Thus, ACE inhibition might be a useful treatment for primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). To determine the dose of ACE inhibitor required to specifically block pulmonary ACE in humans, we measured the combined forward rate constant (CFRC) for [(18)F]-fluorocaptopril, which is proportional to the mass of ACE in the lung, using positron emission tomography (PET). In five normal subjects, CFRC was measured twice, 1 wk apart, to assess measurement reproducibility. The CFRC was 0.151 +/- 0.067 for the first measurement and 0.140 +/- 0.060 for the second measurement (p = not significant [NS]). In five normals, CFRC decreased on average 84%, from 0.177 +/- 0.053/s to 0.028 +/- 0.017/s (p < 0.05), after 1 wk ingestion of 5 mg enalapril orally once a day (the scans were performed 24 h after the last medication). Similarly, in five patients with PPH, CFRC decreased on average 76%, from 0.052 +/- 0. 020/s to 0.012 +/- 0.003 (p < 0.01), after 1 wk enalapril, despite much lower baseline values. We conclude that the total mass of pulmonary ACE appears to be significantly reduced in PPH and that only low doses of ACE inhibitors may be needed to block the effects of ACE on vascular remodeling in PPH.",

Few trials enrolled large numbers of patients or used randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs. However, consistent and positive effects were noted in patients with coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia or IgAN.

In patients with heart failure, maximum pharmacodynamic effects are produced 6 to 8 hours after administration of the drug and persist for 12 to 24 hours. High doses (32.5 to 35mg, administered once daily) of lisinopril in the Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival (ATLAS) study demonstrated clinically important advantages over low doses (2.5 to 5mg, administered once daily) of the drug in the treatment of congestive heart failure. High doses of lisinopril were more effective than low doses in reducing the risk of major clinical events in patients with heart failure treated for 39 to 58 months. Compared with recipients of low doses, those receiving high doses of lisinopril had an 8% lower risk of all-cause mortality (p = 0.128), a 12% lower risk of death or hospitalisation for any reason (p = 0.002) and 24% fewer hospitalisations for heart failure (p = 0.002). These benefits were associated with significant cost savings. In short term (generally 12 weeks' duration) randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre clinical trials, lisinopril was significantly more effective than placebo and was at least as effective as captopril, enalapril, digoxin and irbesartan at improving symptomatic end-points and clinical status in patients with heart failure. Lisinopril is generally well tolerated by patients with heart failure. In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse events occurring in recipients of the drug were dizziness, headache, hypotension and diarrhoea. Overall adverse event profiles for patients treated with high or low doses of lisinopril in the ATLAS study were similar. However, high doses of lisinopril used in the ATLAS study were associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, importantly hypotension and worsening renal function; nevertheless, these events were generally well managed by altering the dose of lisinopril or concomitant medications. Furthermore, despite the higher incidence of some adverse events with high doses of lisinopril, the frequency of treatment discontinuations because of adverse events was the same in the high and low dose groups.",

    "206": "A 50-year-old man received an orthotopic heart transplant because of severe coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure. Two years after the transplantation, a continuous murmur occurred at the left sternal edge after repeated endomyocardial biopsies. Echocardiography and coronary angiography revealed a dilated left anterior descending artery with a fistula to the right ventricle. The circumflex was large with an equally postero-lateral branch, and the right coronary artery was rather small with collaterals to the distal part of the left anterior descending branch. The patient had refused any intervention to close the fistula. The left ventricular levogram was normal. Two years later, in a follow-up angiogram, the left ventricular ejection fraction had decreased as a result of hypo- and akinesis of the apex and posterior wall. We suggest that this local wall motion disturbance derives from a steal phenomenon rather than being a sequela of rejection. The decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction was associated with shortness of breath upon moderate exercise. Standard heart failure medication relieved the patient's symptoms. The observation of local wall motion disturbances in this case, as well as conflicting views in the literature, raises the question whether postbiopsy coronary fistulas in transplant patients should be closed.",

Comparison of these lines with primary cultures of HUVECs has been carried out by monitoring the expression of a number of endothelial cell markers with specific regard to cell age. The secreted levels of the protein plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) was found to be significantly reduced in SV40-transfected cells when compared to untransfected controls. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA) levels were unchanged. As cells entered crisis, there was a rapid and significant increase in the levels of tPA, uPA, and PAl and this was observed for all clones screened. The endothelial cell marker von Willebrand Factor (vWF) was found intracellularly and was also secreted into the medium. The levels were not altered between transfected and untransfected cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was maintained in cell lines at levels found in nonimmortalized HUVECs. Both isoforms (alpha and beta) of IL-1 (interleukin-1) increased as cells approached crisis, and the presence of these cytokines may be responsible for the increased levels of tPA, PAI, and uPA. With one exception, the ability of the transfected cells to produce prostacyclin (PGI2) was lost by all clones.",

We also studied the effects a two-week oral pre-treatment with losartan (10 mg/kg/day) or enalapril (25 mg/kg/day) on endothelin-1-induced changes in the hypotensive responses to bradykinin. Bradykinin (0.4, 1.6, 6.4, and 25 mcg/kg, i.v.) induced dose-dependent hypotensive responses which were attenuated (P<0.05) by endothelin-1 (2 mcg/kg, i.v.). This effect of endothelin-1 was abolished by the mixed endothelin receptor antagonist N-Acetyl-alpha-[10,11-Dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a, d]cycloheptadien-5-yl]-D-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp (PD145065, 1 mg/kg, i.v.). Endothelin-1 also decreased (P<0.05) the responses to bradykinin in rats pre-treated with losartan, but had no effect in rats pre-treated with enalapril. These results suggest that endothelin-1 may contribute to the development of hypertension by decreasing the responses to bradykinin through a mechanism not involving angiotensin AT(1) receptors, although the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme blunted the effect of endothelin-1.",

The effect of trandolapril (0.3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), a non-sulphydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the vascular responsiveness in aorta isolated from hypercholesterolemic rabbits was examined. Three groups of rabbits (n=30) were used: Group 0 (control group); Group 1 (hypercholesterolemic group, 0.5% (wt/wt) cholesterol-enriched diet) and Group 2 (hypercholesterolemic+trandolapril 0.3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). After 18 weeks of treatment, the rabbits were killed and the thoracic aorta, proximal coronary and mesenteric (5th branch) arteries were isolated, cleaned off and mounted in an organ bath. Trandolapril had no significant effect on plasma cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) or low density lipoprotein (LDL). Despite the lack of effect of the drug on the above-mentioned parameters, treatment with trandolapril improved endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by acetylcholine in aortic and mesenteric rings from hypercholesterolemic rabbits treated with trandolapril. The relaxation induced by 10(-5) M acetylcholine were 65.0+/-4.0%; 24. 0+/-9.4% (P<0.01, n=10) and 51.3+/-7.0% (P<0.01, n=10) in aortic rings from Groups 0, 1 and 2, respectively, and 50.0+/-12.0%; 10. 1+/-10.0% (P<0.01, n=10); 61.0+/-9.7% (P<0.01, n=10) in small mesenteric rings from Groups 0, 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, trandolapril treatment improved the increase in serotonin-induced contraction in proximal coronary arteries with respect to the hypercholesterolemic group. On the other hand, we did not find any differences among the group in endothelium-independent relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside. These results provide evidence that trandolapril restores endothelium-dependent relaxation in hypercholesterolemic rabbit-isolated arteries. These data suggest that trandolapril might have beneficial action in the prevention of vascular alteration involved in atherosclerosis.",

    "223": "Alzheimer's disease is characterised by the progressive deposition of the 4 kDa beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) in extracellular senile plaques in the brain. A beta is derived by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by various proteinases termed secretases. alpha-Secretase is inhibited by hydroxamate-based zinc metalloproteinase inhibitors such as batimastat with I50 values in the low micromolar range, and displays many properties in common with the secretase that releases angiotensin converting enzyme. A cell impermeant biotinylated derivative of one such inhibitor completely blocked the release of APP from the surface of neuronal cells, indicating that alpha-secretase cleaves APP at the cell-surface. A range of hydroxamate-based compounds have been used to distinguish between alpha-secretase and tumour necrosis factor-alpha convertase, a member of the ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-like) family of zinc metalloproteinases. Recent data suggests that the presenilins may be aspartyl proteinases with the specificity of gamma-secretase. Although APP and the presenilins are present in detergent-insoluble, cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich lipid rafts, they do not behave as typical lipid raft proteins, and thus it is unclear whether these membrane domains are the sites for proteolytic processing of APP.",

    "229": "Physiological and molecular approaches were used to investigate the existence of an intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in rainbow trout. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by captopril (5 x 10(-4 )M) rapidly decreased vascular resistance of the trunk of the trout, perfused at 19 mmHg, resulting in an increased perfusate flow rate and a decreased intrarenal dorsal aortic pressure. A profound diuresis occurred in the in situ perfused kidney and reflected both increased glomerular filtration rates and decreased water reabsorption (osmolyte reabsorption was unchanged). Renal and vascular parameters recovered once captopril treatment was stopped. Diuretic and vascular effects of captopril on the in situ trout kidney concur with an inhibition of known vasoconstrictor and antidiuretic actions of angiotensin II. However, at a higher perfusion pressure (28 mmHg), captopril had no effect on intrarenal aortic pressure or perfusate and urine flow rates, suggesting that the trout intrarenal RAS is activated by low perfusion pressures/flows. Existence of the renal RAS in trout was further supported by evidence for angiotensinogen gene expression in kidney as well as liver.", 
    "230": "The earlier large multicentre trials in hypertensive patients addressed questions of whether mild to moderate hypertension should be treated and whether similar approaches would be effective in elderly hypertensive patients or those with isolated systolic hypertension. The research focus of recent trials has now shifted to how rather than whether such patients should be treated. Trials such as the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study attempted to discern optimal targets for long-term blood pressure control. Although unsuccessful in this primary aim, they have established the safety of aggressive blood pressure lowering to diastolic targets of less than 80 mmHg as well as the safety and efficacy of a calcium entry blocker as a first line antihypertensive approach. The Captopril Prevention Project study and Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension-2 trial focussed on whether there might be specific antiatherosclerotic advantages of the newer agents (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium entry blockers) over conventional therapy in comparison studies with beta blockers and diuretics. Similar efficacy for cardiovascular outcomes appears to be emerging for each of the major classes of drugs with the degree of blood pressure lowering of prime importance in cardiovascular disease prevention.", 
    "231": "The treatment of high-risk hypertensive patients with diabetes presents clinicians with challenges and opportunities. The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes dramatically and synergistically increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Perhaps most important among these is the increased risk of cardiovascular events in this patient population, an observation that can be best appreciated by the increased number of deaths attributed to cardiovascular-related diseases in diabetic patients aged 45 to 65 years. Consequently, aggressive therapy in this population offers the promise of significantly reducing excess cardiovascular deaths. Despite this opportunity for reducing mortality in these high-risk patients, several challenges to treatment remain. While aggressive blood pressure reduction has been documented to reduce the rate of events in these patients, questions remain as to the level to which blood pressure should be reduced. The recent guidelines from the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure emphasized the importance of treating patients with hypertension and diabetes as if they already have target organ damage. Low blood pressure targets of 130/85 mm Hg, with an optimal goal of 120/80 mm Hg, can reduce the risk of events in hypertensive patients with diabetes, regardless of the pharmacological means used. However, there are physiologic and clinical rationale for renin angiotensin system blockade, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition as the preferential therapy in these patients. In this regard, preliminary data with the new class of angiotensin II receptor blockers suggest that these agents may offer benefits equivalent to those observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors while offering better tolerance.",

In this study, we prospectively investigated the main clinical determinants of progression and response to treatment in the 352 patients enrolled into the REIN study. Mean DeltaGFR (0.56 +/- 0.05 [SEM] versus 0.21 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/mo; P = 0.0001) and incidence of ESRD (30% and 10%; P = 0.0001) were more than twice that in patients with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or greater of protein compared with those with protein less than 2 g/24 h (relative risk [RR], 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20 to 7.52), as well as in patients with hypertension compared with normotension (mean DeltaGFR, 0.48 +/- 0. 05 versus 0.22 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/mon; P = 0.0006; ESRD, 25% versus 10%; P = 0.004; RR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.38 to 7.32). Hypertension at study entry (P = 0.038), greater mean blood pressure on follow-up (P = 0.002), and urinary protein excretion rate (P = 0.0001) were independent predictors of faster DeltaGFR. DeltaGFR was approximately twofold faster in patients with type 2 diabetes than in those with primary glomerular disease (P = 0.002; including immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy, P = 0.009); nephrosclerosis (P = 0.03), adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD), or chronic interstitial nephritis (P = 0.006). Diabetes at study entry (P = 0. 02) and greater mean blood pressure (P = 0.0001) and urinary protein excretion rate (P = 0.0001) on follow-up were independent predictors of faster DeltaGFR. After correction for baseline covariates, diabetes was also associated with an increased risk for progression to ESRD (RR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.01 to 5.68; P < 0.05). At multivariate analyses, ramipril significantly decreased DeltaGFR (regression coefficient,-0.23 +/- 0.11 [SEM]; P = 0.036) and ESRD (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.57; P = 0.008) in patients with baseline proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or greater of protein, and the renoprotective effect increased for increasing levels of proteinuria. Ramipril decreased DeltaGFR to a similar extent in normotensive and hypertensive patients (-0.14 +/- 0.11 versus -0.14 +/- 0.09) and significantly limited ESRD in hypertensive patients (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3. 26; P = 0.004). DeltaGFR was decreased by 42% in primary glomerular disease (P = 0.017), by 35% in IgA nephropathy, and by 37% in nephrosclerosis, but was not improved in type 2 diabetes, APKD, or interstitial nephritis. At multivariate analyses, ramipril significantly slowed DeltaGFR (-0.24 +/-0.08; P = 0.004) and progression to ESRD (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.96; P = 0.002) in patients without diabetes, but not in patients with diabetes, who tended to have a faster DeltaGFR (+0.62 +/- 0.44) on ramipril therapy. In summary, patients with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or greater of protein, preexisting hypertension, or type 2 diabetes were faster progressors. Greater blood pressure and degree of proteinuria were the strongest determinants of faster GFR decline. The renoprotective effect of ramipril was similar in patients with normotension and hypertension. Hypertensive patients and those with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or greater of protein, primary glomerular disease, or nephrosclerosis gained the most from ACE inhibitor treatment. During the study period, those with proteinuria less than 2 g/24 h of protein, type 2 diabetes, or polycystic kidney disease did not benefit by treatment to an appreciable extent.", 
    "238": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may exacerbate anemia in patients with chronic renal failure, as well as in dialysis patients. To better answer this question, a prospective, crossover study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ACE inhibitors on recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in hemodialysis patients. Patients administered an ACE inhibitor when entering the study remained on this drug for the initial 4 months and were then switched to another antihypertensive agent for 4 more months. Patients not initially administered an ACE inhibitor were switched to lisinopril at 4 months. rHuEPO doses were adjusted using a sliding scale based on weekly laboratory hematocrit values. The inclusion criteria were met by 51 patients undergoing dialysis. Demographics were as follows: 61% were women, 64% were black, 46% had diabetes, average age was 53.2 +/- 13.3 years, and time on hemodialysis was 38.0 +/- 44.5 months. Thirty-three patients completed the study. Hematocrit averaged 32.7% +/- 1.9% while on ACE inhibitor therapy and 33.1% +/- 2.1% off ACE inhibitor therapy (P = 0.217). There was no difference in rHuEPO dose per treatment during each period (3,500 +/- 1,549 U on ACE inhibitor therapy versus 3,312 +/- 1,492 U off ACE inhibitor therapy; P = 0.300). No significant differences were found in degree of blood pressure control or various clinical and laboratory parameters that might be associated with rHuEPO resistance between the two periods. Similarly, no differences were found in hospitalization days, duration of infections, or transfusion requirements. These findings suggest that ACE inhibitors do not contribute to rHuEPO resistance in hemodialysis patients.",

More recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become a standard part of management. New developments in the drug treatment of heart failure include the possible addition of beta-blockers or spironolactone to diuretic and ACE inhibitor therapy. Also, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists have been proposed both as an alternative and as additional therapy to ACE inhibitors. Here, we discuss the place of these new approaches in the treatment of patients with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "240": "Captopril renography is used for the non-invasive diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, but suffers from the drawbacks of lower sensitivity and false-positive tests due to a fall in blood pressure. Aspirin renography has been proposed as a useful test for evaluation of unilateral renal artery stenoses of moderate degree. We studied the clinical usefulness of aspirin renography in 12 patients with a clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension and compared it with captopril renography using 99Tcm-DTPA. The test was considered positive if there were changes in the time-activity curve according to the criteria specified by the American Society of Hypertension Working Group. Four patients with discordant results between captopril and aspirin underwent intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography. In two patients, the renal arteries were normal; captopril was false-positive in both these patients. Bilateral stenosis was noted in the third patient, with captopril being false-negative on the right side with moderate stenosis, whereas aspirin was true-positive. There was unilateral stenosis in the fourth patient; captopril was false-positive on the contralateral side. Our results suggest that aspirin renography is superior to captopril renography in the assessment of patients with a suspicion of both unilateral and bilateral renovascular hypertension.",

The administration of drugs was begun on the third day after ablation and continued for 6 to 10 weeks.", 
    "243": "Within one week after ablation, vehicle-treated rats developed hypertension. Although enalapril led to significant reductions in blood pressure, either alone or in combination with the COX-2 inhibitor, SC58236 alone did not significantly alter ablation-induced hypertension. However, the SC58236-treated animals exhibited levels of proteinuria at six weeks after ablation that were comparable to those seen with enalapril (vehicle, 47 +/- 4; enalapril, 27 +/- 2; SC58236, 30 +/- 2 mg/day; N = 7, P < 0.01, each group compared with vehicle), and continued SC58236 treatment led to persistent reductions in proteinuria at 10 weeks after renal ablation (vehicle, 77 +/- 4; SC58236, 50 +/- 4 mg/day; N = 6, P < 0. 01). SC58236 treatment also significantly reduced the percentage of glomeruli exhibiting segmental or global sclerosis at 10 weeks (32.6 +/- 7.8% vs. 10.9 +/- 2.8%, N = 6, P < 0.03).

However, the evidence for the latter effect does not stand close scrutiny. We have assessed the effect of the ACE inhibitor trandolapril on M in 16 patients (mean +/- SD age, 58 +/- 10.6 yr) with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (initial blood pressure, 173 +/- 14.5/93 +/- 8.0 mm Hg), obesity (body mass index, 30 +/- 5.4 kg/m2), and impaired glucose intolerance (n = 4) or type 2 diabetes (n = 12) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. All patients underwent three 3-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies (soluble insulin, 1.5 mU/kg x min) after a 2-week placebo run-in and at the end of two 4-week periods of treatment with 2 mg trandolapril or placebo (2-week washout). M (mean +/- SD) did not change with trandolapril: placebo (run-in), 5.2 +/- 1.98 mg/kg x min; placebo, 5.3 +/- 1.70 mg/kg x min; trandolapril, 5.1 +/- 1.65 mg/kg x min; P = 0.58; 95% confidence intervals, -0.74, 0.43 (trandolapril vs. placebo); 95% power to exclude an 8% increase in M. In conclusion, trandolapril had no clinically relevant effect on M in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Identification of fa derivatives binding to ACE as well as determination of their relative affinities could be accomplished directly from the compound mixtures. Of the five fa derivatives we found that fa-Phe, fa-Trp, and fa-Gly-Leu-NH(2) bind more strongly to ACE than the other two. The dissociation constant of fa-Phe was determined from NMR spectra to 5 x 10(-4) M. A large excess of dipeptides competitively displaced fa-Trp and fa-Phe-Phe from the receptor pocket, allowing the binding site to be mapped. Also, the relative affinities of the fa-Phe, fa-Ala-Lys, and fa-Gly-Leu-NH(2) changed after addition of the dipeptides with fa-Gly-Leu-NH(2) showing the strongest binding. In addition, the presence of a strong inhibitor of the S1' and S2' sites, namely captopril, resulted in the same transferred NOE intensities of fa-Phe, indicating that it binds solely to the S1 and S2 subsites. A rapid screening of binding specificity from mixtures is possible by using a large excess of ligand(s) in transferred NOE studies, even when relatively small amounts of protein are present.",

The cell suspensions were incubated with thiorphan (10(-13) to 10(-5) M) and seeded for the granulocyte/macrophage-colony forming unit (GM-CFU) assay. In normal bone marrow samples the median seeding efficiency was 119 colonies and clusters per 10(5) cells and thiorphan caused slight stimulation of the clonal growth in concentrations above 10(-9) M. In the leukemic samples, the median seeding efficiency varied from 10 to 366 colonies and clusters per 10(5) seeded cells. Meaningful alterations of the clonal growth were noted in 32 out of 83 thiorphan-treated cultures (39%). In those 32 cultures the stimulatory effects outnumbered the inhibitory effects (24 versus 8). Thus, thiorphan stimulated the progenitor cell proliferation in bone marrow samples from the normal donor and from the patients with acute leukemia in remission. Thiorphan binding to CD10 might interfere with the processing of neuropeptide hemoregulatory factors and thus influence the progenitor cell proliferation.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was associated with similar proportional reductions in 30-day mortality among the 86,484 patients who were taking ASA (6% [SD, 3%] reduction) and among the 10,228 patients who were not (10% [SD, 5%] reduction: chi-squared test of heterogeneity between these reductions = 0.4; p = 0.5). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor produced definite increases in the incidence of persistent hypotension (17.9% ACEi vs. 9.4% control) and of renal dysfunction (1.3% ACEi vs. 0.6% control), but there was no good evidence that these effects were different in the presence or absence of ASA (chi-squared for heterogeneity = 0.4 and 0.0, respectively; both not significant).

In the saline group, AERP was significantly shortened during rapid atrial pacing (from 149+/-11 to 132+/-16 ms, P<0.01). There was no significant difference in AERP shortening between the saline group and the Ang II group. However, in the candesartan and captopril groups, shortening of the AERP after rapid pacing was completely inhibited (from 142+/-9 to 147+/-12 ms with candesartan, from 153+/-15 to 153+/-14 ms with captopril, P=NS). Although rate adaptation of the AERP was lost in the saline group, this phenomenon was preserved in the candesartan and captopril groups.",

After 9 months of treatment, mean BP, carotid PP, and intimal-medial thickness (IMT) decreased significantly, with no difference between the 2 groups. The reduction in carotid PP but not in mean BP was a major independent determinant of the reduction in carotid IMT. Radial artery IMT and PP decreased significantly with both treatments. However, the reduction in radial artery IMT was not related to the changes in radial artery PP.", 
    "258": "The regression of carotid artery wall hypertrophy during long-term antihypertensive treatment was dependent on the reduction in local PP rather than on the lowering of mean BP. The effect of PP lowering on IMT reduction was observed at the site of an elastic artery but not at the site of a muscular artery.", 
    "259": "The recommendation for first-line therapy for hypertension remains a beta blocker or diuretic given in a low dosage. A target blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg is achieved in about 50 percent of patients treated with monotherapy; two or more agents from different pharmacologic classes are often needed to achieve adequate blood pressure control. Single-dose combination antihypertension therapy is an important option that combines efficacy of blood pressure reduction and a low side effect profile with convenient once-daily dosing to enhance compliance. Combination antihypertensives include combined agents from the following pharmacologic classes: diuretics and potassium-sparing diuretics, beta blockers and diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics, angiotensin-II antagonists and diuretics, and calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors.", 
    "260": "The distribution patterns of both tissue and keratinocyte transglutaminases (TGase), as well as that of desmoplakin (DP), have been immunohistochemically investigated in human skin cultured in the absence or presence of cystamine and enalapril, two acantholytic agents. In the control samples, tissue TGase is predominantly expressed in lower layers of the epidermis and is located intercellularly. Conversely, in tissues cultured with cystamine or enalapril, a diffuse cytoplasmatic staining was observed. Similarly, DP, detected on the cell membrane in the control, shifts into the cytosol of the keratinocytes following treatment. The distribution pattern of the keratinocyte enzyme in the acantholytic epidermis was identical to that observed in the normal one. Since cystamine and enalapril are TGase inhibitors and DP was shown to act as a TGase substrate in vitro, we suggest that DP and tissue enzyme may participate in cell adhesion at the intraepidermal level.", 
    "261": "The study was designed to assess the antihypertensive effect of combined angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonism in patients with essential hypertension. Twenty patients with uncontrolled ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 weeks of ACE inhibitor monotherapy (benazepril, 20 mg, o.d.) were randomized to receive double-blind valsartan, 80 mg, o.d. (AT1 antagonist) or matching placebo for 5 weeks while continuing to receive background benazepril. Then patients crossed over to the alternative regimen for a second 5-week period. The 24-h ambulatory BP was monitored on the final day of the benazepril monotherapy period and on the final day of each double-blind treatment period. Valsartan added to benazepril produced a significant antihypertensive effect with a benefit over placebo of 6.5 +/- 12.6/4.5 +/- 8.0 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) for average awake ambulatory BP (p < 0.05), 7.1 +/- 9.4/5.6 +/- 6.5 mm Hg for asleep BP (p < 0.01), and 6.8 +/- 9.7/4.9 +/- 6.8 mm Hg for average 24-h ambulatory BP (p < 0.01). Pulse rate was unaffected. Plasma active renin was higher on the benazepril-valsartan combination compared with benazepril-placebo (p < 0.05). There was no change in routine biochemical variables when valsartan was added to benazepril. Six patients reported mild dizziness or fatigue (three also with placebo). These data suggest that in hypertensive patients uncontrolled with an ACE inhibitor, the addition of an AT1 antagonist provides a powerful and safe antihypertensive drug combination.", 
    "262": "We investigated effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril and the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) antagonist candesartan cilexetil on cardiac plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in rats. Cardiac PAI-1 mRNA levels were increased after a 7-day treatment with the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). PAI-1 immunoreactivity was increased in the coronary arteries. Treatment with imidapril significantly prevented the L-NAME-induced increase in the gene expression and immunoreactivity of PAI-1, but candesartan cilexetil showed no such effect. This study provides the first evidence of differential effects of ACE inhibition and AT1 antagonism on cardiac PAI-1 expression in vivo.", 
    "263": "Recent studies showed that in diabetic hypertensive patients, administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors or calcium antagonists can effectively lower blood pressure (BP) and prevent diabetes-related cardiovascular complications with no adverse metabolic effects. We sought to assess the antihypertensive and metabolic effects of the new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist manidipine (M) in patients with diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension as compared with the ACE inhibitor enalapril (E). After 3 weeks of placebo, 101 (62 men; age range, 34-72 years) hypertensives with type II diabetes mellitus were randomized to M 10-20 mg or E 10-20 mg, od, for 24 weeks. At the end of the placebo period and the active-treatment phase, BP was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer (office, O) and over the 24 h by ambulatory (A) monitoring. ABP recordings were analyzed to obtain 24-h, day (6 a.m. to midnight), and night (midnight to 6 a.m.) average systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP and heart rate (HR) values. Homogeneity of the antihypertensive effect over the 24 h was assessed by the smoothness index [SI: i.e., the ratio between the average of the 24 hourly BP changes after treatment and the corresponding standard deviation (the higher the SI, the more uniform is the BP control by treatment over the 24 h]. The O SBP and DBP were significantly (p < 0.01) and similarly reduced by M (16 +/- 10 and 13 +/- 6 mm Hg, n = 49) and E (15 +/- 10 and 13 +/- 6 mm Hg, n = 45). The percentage of patients whose O DBP was reduced < or = 85 mm Hg (i.e., the value indicated to be the optimal DBP goal in diabetic hypertensives) was similar for M (37%) and E (40%). The reduction of 24-h BP also was similar between M (n = 38) and E (n = 38) for both drugs (systolic, 6 +/- 11 and 8 +/- 10 mm Hg; diastolic, 5 +/- 8 and 5 +/- 7; NS, M vs. E). The antihypertensive effect was distributed in a similar homogeneous fashion throughout the dosing interval, as shown by the similar SI values (M, 0.6 +/- 1.2 for SBP and 0.6 +/- 0.9 for DBP; E, 0.6 +/- 0.8 for SBP and 0.5 +/- 0.7 for DBP; NS, M vs. E). O and A HR were unchanged by either treatment. Markers of glucose and lipid metabolism and renal function were not significantly modified by treatment both with M and with E. In the diabetic hypertensives, M was as effective and metabolically neutral as the ACE-inhibitor E.", 
    "264": "We examined possible interactions between intrarenal angiotensin II (ANG II) formation and norepinephrine (NE) release during renal sympathetic nerve stimulation (RNS) in anesthetized dogs. During 10 min of continuous RNS (1.5-2 Hz), the ANG II formation rates (ANG II-FR) and NE secretion rates (NE-SR) were determined at 1 and 10 min. Under control conditions, almost the same extent of increase in the NE-SR was observed at 1 and 10 min of RNS, whereas a significant increase in ANG II-FR was observed at 10 min but not at 1 min. During intrarenal arterial infusion of enalaprilat or losartan, the increase in NE-SR and reduction in renal blood flow at 10 min of RNS were suppressed, whereas the NE release and vasoconstriction responses at 1 min remained unaffected. The RNS-induced increases in ANG II-FR were completely abolished during infusion of enalaprilat. These results suggest that NE release on continuous RNS is enhanced by concomitantly formed ANG II, and this interaction depends on the time-related changes in intrarenal ANG II formation during RNS in the canine kidney.", 
    "265": "A patient who had undergone a first cadaveric donor kidney transplantation for idiopathic focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), had an immediate recurrence of a biopsy-proven FSGS that eventually led to graft failure within 5 years from transplantation. The patient underwent a second cadaveric transplantation 10 months later. An immediate recurrence of a biopsy-proven FSGS occurred that was treated with two protracted cycles of plasmapheresis of seven months each, with the addition of an ACE inhibitor from the beginning. A complete and stable remission of FSGS was observed, which continues after more than 6 years from the end of plasmapheresis. The recurrence of FSGS after a second transplantation has a poor prognosis, but prolonged plasmapheresis treatment, by removing circulating factors altering glomerular permselectivity, and the addition of ACE inhibitors, through their potential interference with TGF-beta, might be synergistic in obtaining permanent remission.", 
    "266": "We report a 72 years old hypertensive female, treated with enalapril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day during three years. She presented a depressive disorder and cytalopram was prescribed in a dose of 10 mg/day. Two weeks before admission, a serum electrolyte analysis disclosed normal results and the cytalopram dose was increased to 20 mg/day. The patient was admitted with a hyponatremic encephalopathy with a plasma sodium of 100 mEq/L and a plasma potassium of 2.0 mEq/L. Cytalopram, enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide were discontinued, hypertonic NaCl and KCl were administered. The patient had a favorable evolution with a remarkable improvement of her symptoms.", 
    "267": "To evaluate whether or not beta-blockers can improve the condition of patients with heart failure treated with a combination of diuretics, digitalis and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), 52 patients with chronic heart failure who have been treated with ACEI for more than 6 months were enrolled. They were divided into 2 groups: 26 patients continued the same therapy another 6 months or more (group A), and 26 patients were given oral metoprolol for 6 months or more, in addition to the ACEI (group B). Echocardiographic parameters and atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) were measured. The left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole were significantly decreased and fractional shortening was significantly increased in group B after 6 months' treatment with the beta-blocker, but these parameters remained unchanged in group A. Plasma levels of both ANP and BNP were significantly decreased in group B, but remained unchanged in group A. These results indicate that concomitant beta-blocker therapy can improve left ventricular function and attenuate plasma ANP and BNP levels in patients with chronic heart failure treated with ACEI.", 
    "268": "In the present study, myocardial microvessels were investigated by stereology in rats with nitric oxide blockade and concomitant antihypertensive treatment for 40 days. The following five groups (10 rats each) were studied: control; L-NAME; L-NAME + spironolactone; L-NAME + enalapril; L-NAME + verapamil. The blood pressure (BP) increased every week in the L-NAME group; after an initial increase BP decreased in the treated groups and was not different from the control group. Compared to control animals, the myocardium had hypertrophied myocytes and capillary rarefaction; the tunica media and the tunica intima of small arteries were thickened, and an increase in collagen fibrils in L-NAME treated animals was noted. The enalapril, verapamil and spironolactone groups showed uniform myocardium, quite similar to the control group. The volume density of vessels, in comparison with the L-NAME group, was greater in the spironolactone group (57%), in the enalapril group (76%) and in the verapamil group (81%). The length density of vessels was, respectively, 56%, 50%, and 76% greater in the spironolactone, enalapril and verapamil groups than in the L-NAME group. The surface density of the vessels of the L-NAME group was, respectively, 88%, 96%, and 113% lower than in the spironolactone, enalapril and verapamil groups. These results are compatible with the occurrence of angiogenesis in the verapamil rats.",

Ex vivo infarct size, infarct collagen (hydroxyproline), collagen volume fraction and LV topography were measured at six weeks.", 
    "271": "Compared with placebo controls without reperfusion over six weeks in vivo, enalapril or amlodipine with or without reperfusion produced LV unloading and preserved volumes, shape and function, but enalapril limited LV hypertrophy more than amlodipine. However, compared with no reperfusion, amlodipine preserved infarct wall thickness and shape while enalapril decreased infarct wall thickness and increased the shape index. Ex vivo at six weeks, scar size as a percentage of risk was similar in the MI groups. Importantly, enalapril decreased infarct collagen already lowered by reperfusion, while amlodipine preserved infarct collagen after reperfusion and increased collagen volume fraction in spared myocardium.",

The objective was to investigate association among case fatality, treatment and case severity of MI in hospitalized patients.",

Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate trends in the use of cardioactive drugs and revascularization procedures. A case severity score was developed from patient characteristics at time of admission. Case fatality was calculated as the proportion of MIs that were fatal within 28 days.",

From 1989 to 1993, ACE inhibitor use increased (OR=1.4, 99% CI 1.27 to 1.55); minor increases occurred in use of ASA and beta-blockers, and in PTCA and coronary artery bypass grafting; case severity did not change and case fatality decreased.", 
    "276": "While use of beneficial treatment increased between 1984 and 1988, MI case fatality did not decrease, probably because case severity increased.

    "277": "A multicenter retrospective study was conducted to investigate the possible metabolic causes of pediatric cardiomyopathy and evaluate the outcome of patients treated with L-carnitine.", 
    "278": "Seventy-six patients diagnosed with cardiomyopathy were treated with L-carnitine in addition to conventional cardiac treatment, and 145 patients were treated with conventional treatment only. There were 101 males and 120 females between 1 day and 18 years old. Cardiomyopathy diagnoses included dilated (148 patients), hypertrophic (42 patients), restrictive (16 patients), mixed diagnosis (11 patients), and 4 with an unknown type. Of 76 L-carnitine-treated patients, 29 (38%) had evidence to suggest a disorder of metabolism, and of 145 control patients, 15 (10%) were suspected to have a disorder of metabolism. These metabolic disorders were thought to be the cause for the cardiomyopathy of the patients. The duration of L-carnitine treatment ranged from 2 weeks to >1 year. Information was collected on length of survival (time-to-event), clinical outcome, echocardiogram parameters, and clinical assessments. Data were collected at intervals from baseline to study endpoint, death, transplant, or last known follow-up visit.", 
    "279": "L-Carnitine-treated patients were younger than control patients and had poorer clinical functioning at baseline, yet they demonstrated lower mortality and a level of clinical functioning and clinical severity comparable to control patients on conventional therapy by the end of the study. An analysis of the interaction between clinical outcome and concomitant medications unexpectedly revealed that the population of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (40% of patients) had significantly poorer survival (although their greater likelihood for poor survival may possibly have made them more likely to receive ACE inhibitors).",

    "281": "1. The circumventricular organs (CVO) are structures that permit polypeptide hypothalamic hormones to leave the brain without disrupting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and permit substances that do not cross the BBB to trigger changes in brain function. 2. In mammals, CVO include only the median eminence and adjacent neurohypophysis, organum vasculosum lamina terminalis, subfornical organ and the area postrema. 3. The CVO are characterized by their small size, high permeability and fenestrated capillaries. The subcommissural organ is not highly permeable and does not have fenestrated capillaries, but new evidence indicates that it may be involved in the hypertension produced by aldosterone acting on the brain. 4. Feedback control of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion is exerted by free steroids diffusing into the brain, but substances such as cytokines and angiotensin II act on CVO to produce increases in CRH secretion. Gonadal steroids also diffuse into the brain to regulate gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone secretion is regulated by thyroid hormones transported across cerebral capillaries. However, CVO may be involved in the negative feedback control of growth hormone and prolactin secretion.", 
    "282": "1. Renin inhibitors may be more advantageous than either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin (Ang) antagonists in blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) because they do not allow accumulation of either AngI or AngII in plasma. 2. Effects of i.v. administration of two human renin inhibitors (EMD 58265 and U 71038) were compared with the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat on mean blood pressure (BP), renal blood flow (RBF) and plasma AngI and AngII in the anaesthetized two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt rabbit. 3. At doses of 2-2.5 mg/kg, i.v., EMD 58265 and 5-10 mg/kg, i.v., U 71038, both drugs decreased BP approximately 10 mmHg more than enalaprilat (2-4 mg/kg, i.v.) when given either before or after the ACE inhibitor. None of the three agents had any significant effect on RBF in the face of the lowered BP; however, renal vascular resistance was decreased. A higher dose of enalaprilat (10 mg/kg, i.v.) had no further effect on BP than the lower doses but did cause a marked increase in RBF. 4. Both renin inhibitors markedly decreased plasma AngI, but the high basal level of AngII was less consistently and only modestly affected. Enalaprilat, in either the low dose range or at the high dose, was also not effective in significantly decreasing AngII. 5. The results indicate that renin inhibition in the rabbit with a high circulating AngII level is more effective in lowering BP than ACE inhibition. A high dose of the ACE inhibitor may be required to block the intrarenal RAS, which may account for the increase in RBF.",

    "284": "In a prospective case-control study, heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex control were compared preoperatively and 30 min after anesthesia induction in patients receiving, or not, ACEI (n=16, control group and n=16, ACEI group). All patients had normal cardiac function and anesthesia consisted of a fixed dose regimen of fentanyl and midazolam. Anesthesia-related hypotension was defined by systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg. Spectral density of HRV was calculated for low frequency and high frequency bands (LF, from 0.05 to 0.15 Hz and HF, from > 0.15 to 0.6 Hz). Baroreflex sensitivity was estimated after blood pressure changes induced by injections of phenylephrine (PHE) and nitroglycerin (NTG).", 
    "285": "The HRV parameters and baroreflex sensitivity were not different between groups, during the awake and anesthesia periods. Anesthesia produced similar reduction in total HRV in the Control and ACEI groups (-93 +/- 28% vs -89 +/- 32%), and in baroreflex sensitivity during NTG (-64 +/- 21% vs -54 +/- 17%) or PHE tests (-74 +/- 25% vs -72 +/- 22%). Anesthesia-related hypotension occurred in nine patients in the ACEI group (vs two controls). Although the hypertensive response to phenylephrine was greater after anesthesia in both groups, the sensitivity to phenylephrine was attenuated in those patients experiencing hypotension in the ACEI group.", 
    "286": "Chronic preoperative treatment with ACEIs does not influence cardiac autonomic regulation and anesthetic-induced hypotensive episodes are mainly attributed to decreased alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictive response.", 
    "287": "Large-scale clinical trials of vasodilators with nitrates and hydralazine and with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the 1980s and early 1990s provided the first credible evidence that medical therapy can prolong survival in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Moreover, patients treated with ACE inhibitors required fewer hospitalizations for worsening heart failure (HF). Nonetheless, the prognosis in patients with HF remains bleak, and better therapies are urgently needed. Recently, beta-blockers and spironolactone have been shown to reduce mortality when added to ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digoxin. Digoxin has a neutral effect on overall mortality but does reduce the rate of hospitalization. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) inhibit the AT1 angiotensin receptor, which mediates the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system, and may provide advantages over ACE inhibitors or advantages when used in combination with ACE inhibitors. Newer drugs that interfere with other mechanisms that contribute to progression of heart failure are also under study. As new therapies prove effective in large populations, they lead to a mandate for polypharmacy. The long-term solution to this clinical problem is to develop sensitive and reliable markers that can predict response in individual patients or monitor effectiveness of therapy.", 
    "288": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is integrally involved in maintaining the healthy body's hemodynamic status. It is also involved in many pathogenic situations. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the major effector hormone of this system. Ang II subtype 1 receptor blockers (ARB), like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, modulate the potent vasoconstricting and growth-promoting effects of Ang II. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that ACE inhibitors and ARB provide similar benefits in patients with hypertension and other diseases. There are salient differences, however, in that ARB antagonize Ang II at its AT1 receptor subtype but spare its AT2 receptor subtype, which has unique-and largely oppositional- effects on the blood vessels, kidneys, and adrenals. ACE inhibitors decrease the amount of Ang II available to its AT1 and AT2 receptors alike without totally suppressing its formation. This article reviews recent findings about the role of the AT2 receptor in both health and disease and the actions of ARB mediated by this receptor.",

    "290": "Patients were identified from a review of all charts seen in our conservative management renal clinic in 1996, a review of renal biopsy rolls (1994-1998), and a review of patients entering the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program with a primary diagnosis of FSGS (1993- 1997). Charts were reviewed for demographic, biopsy, and treatment data. Patients who were observed for at least 4 months (range, 4-125 months) were included. ESRD was used as the primary endpoint (n = 12). Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Twenty-four patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Similarly, 24 patients were treated with corticosteroids for a mean of 8.75 +/- 2.6 months and a total dose of 9.3 +/- 2.2 g.", 
    "291": "On univariate analysis, factors found to be significant determinants for reaching ESRD were the initial creatinine (P = 0.0001), interstitial fibrosis (P = 0.032), the percentage of globally sclerosed glomeruli (P = 0.0018), and the mean arterial blood pressure over the course of follow-up (P = 0.05). Neither the ACE inhibitors nor the corticosteroids had a significant impact on reaching ESRD. The patients reaching ESRD (n = 12) were analyzed separately. The mean time from biopsy to ESRD was 24.7 +/- 9.8 months. ACE inhibitors prolonged renal survival (P = 0.023), but steroids did not. Initial creatinine was the only factor found to be a significant determinant for ESRD.",

    "293": "Endothelium-dependent relaxation of aorta and carotid artery from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and the effect of chronic treatment of SHRSP with perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on endothelium-dependent relaxation were studied. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was induced by acetylcholine (ACh) in preparations of SHRSP and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) precontracted with noradrenaline. The ACh-induced relaxation in both preparations was abolished by L-nitroarginine. The ACh-induced relaxation was impaired in preparations from SHRSP and contraction was observed at high concentrations of ACh. In the presence of indomethacin, impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation in SHRSP was minimized and the contraction was inhibited. The relaxation with sodium nitroprusside did not differ between the preparations from WKY and SHRSP. Treatment of SHRSP with perindopril (2 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks decreased systolic blood pressure and improved the ACh-induced relaxation of aorta and carotid artery. The treatment inhibited the contraction by higher concentrations of ACh in the presence of L-nitroarginine. These results indicate that the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation in aorta and carotid artery of SHRSP may be caused by the reduced availability of nitric oxide. The perindopril-treatment may prevent these changes in SHRSP.", 
    "294": "The effective treatment of hypertension is an extremely important consideration in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Virtually any drug class--with the possible exception of diuretics--can be used to treat hypertension in the patient with ESRD. Despite there being such a wide range of treatment options, drugs which interrupt the renin-angiotensin axis are generally suggested as agents of choice in this population, even though the evidence in support of their preferential use is quite scanty. ACE inhibitors, and more recently angiotensin antagonists, are the 2 drug classes most commonly employed to alter renin-angiotensin axis activity and therefore produce blood pressure control. ACE inhibitor use in patients with ESRD can sometimes prove an exacting proposition. ACE inhibitors are variably dialysed, with compounds such as catopril, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril undergoing substantial cross-dialyser clearance during a standard dialysis session. This phenomenon makes the selection of a dose and the timing of administration for an ACE inhibitor a complex issue in patients with ESRD. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors are recognised as having a range of nonpressor effects that are pertinent to patients with ESRD. Such effects include their ability to decrease thirst drive and to decrease erythropoiesis. In addition, ACE inhibitors have a unique adverse effect profile. As is the case with their use in patients without renal failure, use of ACE inhibitors in patients with ESRD can be accompanied by cough and less frequently by angioneurotic oedema. In the ESRD population, ACE inhibitor use is also accompanied by so-called anaphylactoid dialyser reactions. Angiotensin antagonists are similar to ACE inhibitors in their mechanism of blood pressure lowering. Angiotensin antagonists are not dialysable and therefore can be distinguished from a number of the ACE inhibitors. In addition, the adverse effect profile for angiotensin antagonists is remarkably bland, with cough and angioneurotic oedema rarely, if ever, occurring. In patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists are also not associated with the anaphylactoid dialyser reactions which occur with ACE inhibitors. The nonpressor effects of angiotensin antagonists--such as an influence on thirst drive and erythropoiesis--have not been explored in nearly the depth, as they have been with ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have not been compared directly to angiotensin antagonists in patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists possess a number of pharmacokinetic and adverse effect characteristics, which would favour their use in this population.", 
    "295": "Obstructive nephropathy is a relatively common entity that is treatable and often reversible. It occurs at all ages from infancy to elderly subjects. Obstructive uropathy is classified according to the degree, duration and site of the obstruction. It is the result of functional or anatomic lesions located in the urinary tract. The causes of obstructive uropathy are many. Obstruction of the urinary tract may decrease renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate. Several abnormalities in tubular function may occur in obstructive nephropathy. These include decreased reabsorption of solutes and water, inability to concentrate the urine and impaired excretion of hydrogen and potassium. Renal interstitial fibrosis is a common finding in patients with long-term obstructive uropathy. Several factors: macrophages, growth factors, hypoxia, cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis. It has been shown that ACE inhibitors ameliorate the interstitial fibrosis in animals with obstructive uropathy.", 
    "296": "The possible negative therapeutic interaction between aspirin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors arose from the conclusions of several experimental studies and retrospective analysis of large scale mortality trials with converting enzyme inhibitors. Some experimental results show inhibition of the vasodilatation of converting enzyme inhibitors, increase in pulmonary pressures, vascular resistances and blood pressure, and degradation of renal function and exercise capacity. However, other studies did not confirm these results. In large scale therapeutic trials, some retrospective analyses, but not all of them, have shown less benefit on morbi-mortality of converting enzyme inhibitors in patients on aspirin. The differences between the doses of aspirin, the type and dosage of the converting enzyme inhibitors and neuro-hormonal activation of the patients could explain the discordant results. The results of randomised trials are awaited but, in the meantime, it is logical to propose small doses of aspirin (< or = 100 mg/day) for patients with cardiac failure and atherosclerosis and to avoid the association in all the other patients.",

The prevention of these ventricular arrhythmias is only worthwhile if it results in benefits in terms of reduction of the risk of sudden death and in improvement in life expectancy. However, the relationship between complex ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death is far from established. The first problem is, therefore, to select the patients at high risk of sudden death. Unfortunately, there are no reliable markers of arrhythmic risk; only patients at low risk can be reasonably well identified on clinical and haemodynamic assessment and the results of ambulatory and signal averaged ECG. When an antiarrhythmic treatment seems to be required, the choice is very limited in practice. There is no role for Class I antiarrhythmics to play in this indication. Amiodarone, with its complex electrophysiological profile enabling an interaction with all potential mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias, is a first-line drug in cardiac failure because of its efficacy and good myocardial tolerance. However, the benefits of amiodarone therapy in terms of reduction of global mortality have not been demonstrated, especially in view of the discordance between the results of the GESICA and CHF STAT trials. On the other hand, the value of betablockers, whether conventional molecules like bisoprolol (CIBIS II study) or metoprolol (MERIT-HF study), or molecules with a special profile such as carvedilol, has been clearly established. In association with conventional diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, they reduce global mortality by about 35% and sudden death by 40%. However, the future possibly lies with non-pharmacological approaches such as the implantable defibrillator, at least in patients clearly identified as being at high risk of arrhythmic death, resuscitated from cardiorespiratory arrest due to documented ventricular fibrillation or presenting with haemodynamically poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia. The automatic defibrillator could improve the prognosis of these patients, irrespective of their functional status (NYHA, Classes I, II or III). In practice, \"rhythmological\" management of cardiac failure cannot be dissociated from the haemodynamic and neuro-hormonal aspects of the affection, and only a multi-factorial approach is being realistic.", 
    "298": "The aim of this update is to review the role of digitalis and betablockers in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure. The role of digitalis is unquestioned in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure complicated by atrial fibrillation resistant to attempts at reduction. Digoxin, with a shorter half-life, is preferred to digitalis. When in sinus rhythm, digoxin is indicated in association with diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, to improve the quality of life without demonstrable effects on survival. Betablockers now have a recognised place in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure in association with diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The compilation of the US-Carvedilol HF Trial have shown a 67% reduction in mortality at 6 months. Carvedilol has been officially approved for use in this indication. Some betablockers are under evaluation, regarding positive results in term of mortality, some clinical trials have been stopped. This review emphasises the changes in prescribing habits of digitalis, and mostly betablockers, in chronic cardiac failure.", 
    "299": "Diuretics were the first family of drugs to be used in cardiac failure. They improve symptoms but no randomised control trials show their efficacy in prolonging survival. The results of the recent RALES trial, however, provides evidence in favour of antialdosterone diuretics on survival in association with a loop diuretic and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. At present, the legal requirements in France state that \"the association of spironolactone and converting enzyme inhibitors is possible with low doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretic hypokalaemiant; kalaemia and creatinine have to be monitored\". \"The association of hypokalaemia-inducing diuretics (loop diuretics, thiazides and similar: the association with this type of diuretic, rational and useful in certain patients, does not exclude the risk of hypo- or even hyperkalaemia, especially in renal failure and diabetes; it also imposes the monitoring of serum potassium and eventually of the electrocardiogram and, if necessary, to reconsider the treatment\". Many points remain unclear concerning the value and harmlessness of the prescription of diuretics in asymptomatic left ventricular failure. In cases of diuretic resistance, the use of intravenous administration, the fragmentation of doses or the association of diuretics, may induce a diuretic response. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the first line treatment of moderate and severe cardiac failure and in post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction. On the other hand, the value of this family of drugs in left ventricular failure and normal systolic function has not been demonstrated. Analysis of clinical practice shows an underprescription of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, both in number of patients and in dosage. The results of the recent ATLAS trial suggest that high doses of lisinopril improve morbidity related to cardiac failure and the combined morbi-mortality criterion. The results of this study incite the prescription of high rather than low doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.",

    "306": "The kallikrein-kinin system is complex, with several bioactive peptides that are formed in many different compartments. Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. We established a methodology for the measurement of individual kinin peptides in order to study the function of the kallikrein-kinin system. The levels of kinin peptides in tissues were higher than in blood, confirming the primary tissue localization of the kallikrein-kinin system. Moreover, the separate measurement of bradykinin and kallidin peptides in man demonstrated the differential regulation of the plasma and tissue kallikrein-kinin systems, respectively. Kinin peptide levels were increased in the heart of rats with myocardial infarction, in tissues of diabetic and spontaneously hypertensive rats, and in urine of patients with interstitial cystitis, suggesting a role for kinin peptides in the pathogenesis of these conditions. By contrast, blood levels of kallidin, but not bradykinin, peptides were suppressed in patients with severe cardiac failure, suggesting that the activity of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system may be suppressed in this condition. Both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors increased bradykinin peptide levels. ACE and NEP inhibitors had different effects on kinin peptide levels in blood, urine, and tissues, which may be accounted for by the differential contributions of ACE and NEP to kinin peptide metabolism in the multiple compartments in which kinin peptide generation occurs. Measurement of the levels of individual kinin peptides has given important information about the operation of the kallikrein-kinin system and its role in physiology and disease states.", 
    "307": "Photosynthesis in plant species that are evolutionarily adapted for growth in warm climates is highly sensitive to illumination under cool conditions. Although it is well documented that illumination of these sensitive species under cool conditions results in the photosynthetic production of reactive oxygen molecules, the underlying mechanism for the inhibition of photosynthesis remains uncertain. Determinations of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase activity showed that the light-dependent, reductive activation of these key carbon reduction cycle enzymes was substantially inhibited in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) following illumination at 4 degrees C. However, other chloroplast enzymes also dependent on thioredoxin-mediated reductive activation were largely unaffected. We performed equilibrium redox titrations to investigate the thermodynamics of the thiol/disulfide exchange between thioredoxin f and the regulatory sulfhydryl groups of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, phosphoribulokinase, NADP-glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, and the chloroplast ATPsynthase. We determined that the redox midpoint potentials for the regulatory sulfhydryl groups of the various enzymes spanned a broad range ( approximately 50 mV at pH 7. 9). The electron-sharing equilibria among thioredoxin f and its target enzymes largely explained the differential effects of photooxidation induced at low temperature on thioredoxin-mediated activation of chloroplast enzymes in tomato. These results not only provide a plausible mechanism for the low-temperature-induced inhibition of photosynthesis in this important group of plants, but also provide a quantitative basis to evaluate the influence of thioredoxin/target enzyme electron-sharing equilibria on the differential activation and deactivation kinetics of thioredoxin-regulated chloroplast enzymes.", 
    "308": "It is the very nature of research, including medical research, that truly novel results are not predictable. Nevertheless, some predictions concerning the understanding and management of progression of renal disease are plausible. It is very likely that in the future, exploding health budgets will force authorities and nephrologists to more effectively apply existing knowledge in this field to patients with early renal disease, particularly diabetics. We hope that this optimistic note is justified, although experience admittedly indicates that it is very much against human nature to behave rationally. With the powerful methodological tools available today, it is safe to predict that insight into the mechanisms underlying progression will also increase. Although pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been one of the great success stories of the past two decades, in many patients, progression is seen despite administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Fortunately, additional targets for intervention, such as endothelin-1, inflammatory cascades, chemokines, etc., are on the horizon. A particularly fertile target for prevention of progression will be kidney grafts, since it has become increasingly clear that factors unrelated to allo-immunity play an important role in chronic allograft nephropathy.", 
    "309": "A role for hypertension in the progression of renal disease has been convincingly shown in experimental animals only. In human studies, the relation between hypertension and progression is difficult to demonstrate due to several confounding factors: age, gender, race; the difficult choice of blood pressure (BP) parameters that correlate with progression; the abnormal circadian BP pattern; and the many non-hemodynamic factors of progression. An important role for hypertension in progressive nondiabetic renal disease has been suggested by observational studies and clinical trials originally intended to evaluate the effect of dietary protein restriction on progression. In addition, several studies, summarized by a recent meta-analysis, have shown that pharmacological agents which lower both BP and proteinuria, mainly the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), significantly slow the rate of progression in these diseases.", 
    "310": "In this article we review the effect of lowering BP on the progression of nondiabetic chronic renal disease, the patient characteristics that are associated with a greater or lesser benefit of blood pressure reduction, and the choice of antihypertensive regimens associated with better outcomes in patients with renal disease.", 
    "311": "Lower levels of achieved BP are associated with a slower decline in renal function, both in patients with and without proteinuria. ACEI are effective BP lowering agents and are associated with better preservation of renal function as opposed to antihypertensive regimens without ACEI. This protective effect of ACEI is in addition to their BP and urine protein lowering effects. The protective effect of ACEI on renal function is more pronounced in patients with proteinuria.", 
    "312": "In patients with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria, the risk of progression can be minimized by lowering both BP and proteinuria. ACEI have an additional beneficial effect.", 
    "313": "Reduction of proteinuria is a prerequisite for successful long-term renoprotection. To investigate whether individual patient factors are determinants of antiproteinuric efficacy, we analyzed individual responses to different modes of antiproteinuric intervention in nondiabetic and diabetic patients, obtained in prior studies comparing the efficacy of various pharmacological regimens. The individual antiproteinuric response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition positively correlated to the response to angiotensin type I (AT1) receptor blockade in diabetic (r = 0.67, P < 0.01, N = 16) as well as nondiabetic patients (r = 0.75, P < 0.01, N = 12). This corresponded to the correlations for antihypertensive efficacy between ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade in diabetic (r = 0.73, P < 0.001) as well as nondiabetic patients (r = 0.55, P < 0.05). Remarkably, the antiproteinuric response to ACE inhibition also correlated positively to the antiproteinuric response to indomethacin (r = 0.63, P < 0.05, N = 9). Thus, patients responding favorably to one class of antiproteinuric drugs also respond favorably to other classes of available drugs, supporting a main role for individual patient factors in responsiveness or resistance to antiproteinuric intervention. In the search for strategies to improve response in these high risk patients, combination-treatment (combining different drugs, and combining drugs with dietary measures like sodium and protein restriction), and the use of higher doses may provide more fruitful strategies to optimize renoprotection than shifting to other classes of the available drugs.",

Captopril also reduced LV end-systolic volume index (98 +/- 24 to 89 +/- 21 mL/m(2), P <.01 vs. baseline), whereas a nonsignificant trend was observed for the losartan group (97 +/- 23 to 90 +/- 16 mL/m(2), P = not significant).

    "319": "This study examined the effect of the pharmacological manipulation of adrenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on aldosterone secretion from in situ perfused adrenals of rats kept on a normal diet and sodium restricted for 14 days. Neither the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril nor the nonselective angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin and the AT(1) receptor-selective antagonist losartan affected basal aldosterone output in normally fed rats. In contrast, they concentration dependently decreased aldosterone secretion in sodium-restricted animals, with maximal effective concentration ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. Captopril (10(-6) M), saralasin (10(-6) M), and losartan (10(-7) M) counteracted aldosterone response to 10 mM K(+) in sodium-restricted rats but not in normally fed animals. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that adrenal RAS plays a role in the regulation of aldosterone secretion, but only under conditions of prolonged stimulation of zona glomerulosa probably leading to overexpression of adrenal RAS.", 
    "320": "Ischemic heart disease is the most common underlying cause of congestive heart failure, and thus aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly used together for treatment in this setting. The issue of possible attenuation of the effect of ACE inhibitors by ASA has been an area of intense debate. Currently, it is perceived that a significant part of the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors is related to augmentation of bradykinin levels, which among other effects stimulate the release of prostacyclin. Aspirin, on the other hand, inhibits the production of prostacyclin by blocking cyclooxygenase. Prostaglandins play an important endogenous vasodilatory role and counteract the enhanced peripheral vasoconstriction state in congestive heart failure. Thus, the counteracting effect of ASA on the augmentation of prostacyclin synthesis by ACE inhibitors could result in a potential reduction of the beneficial effects of the ACE inhibitor's and could be of great importance. This article reviews reports from large clinical trials pertaining to this issue and relates their findings to the currently available theoretical bases for support of the counteracting effect of ASA on augmentation of prostacyclin synthesis by ACE inhibitors. The clinical implications of such an interaction are discussed.", 
    "321": "The purpose of these investigations was to determine whether the aminopeptidase B and leucine aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin, the chymase inhibitor chymostatin, the calpain inhibitor E-64, and the neutral serine protease inhibitor leupeptin affect the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in T-lymphocytes. ACE activity in homogenates of T-lymphocytes or in intact T-lymphocytes in suspension was measured by determining fluorimetrically histidyl-leucine, formed from the conversion of hippuryl-histidyl-leucine, coupled with ophtaldialdehyde. The effect of various concentrations (10(-9) to 10(-3) mol/L) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lisinopril and captopril and of the various protease inhibitors on ACE activity was studied. Lisinopril and captopril reduced the ACE activity in homogenates of T-lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Lisinopril exhibited a more pronounced inhibition of ACE in T-lymphocytes than did captopril. Chymostatin and E-64 had no effect on the ACE activity in T-lymphocytes, whereas leupeptin inhibited its activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Bestatin, on the contrary, increased the ACE activity in homogenates of T-lymphocytes as well as in intact T-lymphocytes in proportion to the concentration. Our data showed that the ACE activity in T-lymphocytes was stimulated by bestatin and inhibited by leupeptin, whereas chymostatin and E-64 did not affect the ACE activity in T-lymphocytes.", 
    "322": "A large body of literature accumulated over the past several years supports the notion that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system protects the heart and other target organs from hypertensive complications. Various studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in the setting of ischemic heart disease and/or congestive heart failure. The improvement in survival has been attributed in part to a significant decrease in the incidence of sudden deaths, possibly due to a decrease in complex arrhythmia episodes. Recently, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan was shown to reduce mortality by 46% compared with captopril in older patients with chronic congestive heart failure. This paper briefly reviews the arrhythmogenic properties of angiotensin II and the possible pharmacologic mechanisms for the antiarrhythmogenic potential of losartan.",

Women, aged 40 to 69 years, with a seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 to 115 mm Hg, were randomized to candesartan cilexetil, 8 to 16 mg (n = 140), enalapril, 10 to 20 mg (n = 146), or HCTZ, 12.5 to 25 mg (n = 143), for 12 weeks; the higher doses were used if DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg after 6 weeks. Candesartan cilexetil lowered seated blood pressure by 17/11 and 19/11 mm Hg after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. This reduction was greater (P < .01) than with enalapril (12/8 and 13/9 mm Hg) or HCTZ (12/7 and 13/8 mm Hg). The proportions of patients with controlled DBP (< 90 mm Hg) after 12 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil, enalapril, or HCTZ were 60%, 51%, and 43%, respectively. Patients experienced less dry cough (P < 0.001) with candesartan cilexetil or HCTZ than with enalapril. No treatment differences were found in the incidence of dizziness and quality of life was well maintained in all groups. Compared with candesartan cilexetil and enalapril, HCTZ increased uric acid and decreased serum potassium (P < .001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil reduced blood pressure more effectively and was better tolerated than enalapril or HCTZ in women with mild to moderate hypertension.",

Each was in balance with a 10-mEq sodium, 100-mEq potassium intake and was studied before and during ACE inhibition with enalapril. Ang I (3, 10, and 30 ng/kg/min) was infused in each subject. Then ACE inhibition was instituted with enalapril for 3 days, which induced the anticipated fall in blood pressure, plasma Ang II, and aldosterone concentration, and rise in renal plasma flow. During ACE inhibition only the 30-ng/kg/min Ang I dose raised plasma Ang II levels. There was a spectrum, however, in the end-organ response to Ang I during ACE inhibition. Responses of plasma aldosterone concentration and blood pressure were in excellent accord with the reduction in Ang II formation. On the other hand, responses of the renal blood supply were substantially less inhibited than anticipated. Under the conditions of this study, ACE inhibition led to nonuniform changes in the response to exogenous Ang I, suggesting intrarenal conversion of Ang I to Ang II.", 
    "325": "Patients aged 60 years and older with essential hypertension were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), delapril (Adecut) or a long-acting calcium (Ca)-antagonist, manidipine (Calslot) for 3 years. The incidences of cardiovascular events as well as drug-related side effects were compared between the two groups to investigate whether both classes of antihypertensive drugs are beneficial in elderly hypertensive patients. There were no significant differences in characteristics of patients between the two intervention groups, except for slightly lower blood pressure (P = .08) in the Ca-antagonist group at the initiation of the study. There were no significant differences in total death between the two groups. Cardiovascular events (both fatal and nonfatal) were noted in 34 of 699 patients (22.5/1000 patient-years) in the ACE-I group and 50 of 1049 patients (19.7/1000 patient-years) in the Ca-antagonist group, with no significant difference found between the two groups. The correlation between cardiovascular incidence and the blood pressure attained during treatment showed a J-shaped phenomenon and suggests that an excessive reduction less than 120 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) is unnecessary and may be harmful in certain cases. Side effects were more frequent in the ACE-I group than in the Ca-antagonist group (P = .01). Cough was the major adverse event, occurring in 5.0% of patients in the ACE-I group. In conclusion, the study indicates that both ACE-I (delapril) and Ca-antagonist (manidipine) were equally beneficial for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in elderly hypertensive patients. However, tolerability of ACE-I was lower due to the adverse event of coughing.", 
    "326": "Essential hypertension affects more than 40 million Americans, or one in four adults. The prevalence of hypertension is greater among the African-American population, with a distressingly high rate of end-organ complications. Although diabetes mellitus has surpassed hyper tension as the dominant etiology of end-stage renal disease in the United States, kidney failure secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis remains a significant problem, particularly among African Americans. During the past decade, a shift in the paradigm for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has evolved from a circulating vasoactive cascade toward angiotensin II (ANG II) formation at the cellular level. The molecular components of the RAS have been identified in cells, documenting the existence of an autocrine tissue RAS, as well as the presence of enzymes, which catalyze the formation of ANG II by angiotensin-converting-enzyme-independent pathways, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. The latter challenge has important clinical implications, in view of recent evidence implicating ANG II in pathologic cell growth and cell death and fundamental events in the remodeling of the vascular wall and myocardium in the setting of hypertension. This review focuses on ANG II as a major determinant of end-organ damage in essential hypertension; the benefits of ANG II blockade at the end-organ level, which appear to be independent of the blood pressure-lowering effect; and the emerging role for ANG II receptor antagonists as first-line agents in the treatment of essential hypertension.",

Most reports have provided neither a definition of 'additive' nor the necessary information to determine whether the effects are additive. In this review of the medical literature, the effects of combination therapy were defined as additive if the sum of the mean reductions in BP following monotherapy with a CCB and an ACE inhibitor was not significantly different from the mean reduction in BP of combination therapy. The review generally showed that combination therapy is more effective than treatment with either monotherapy alone, based on mean decreases in either diastolic or systolic BP. The studies provided no clear evidence that the effects of combination therapy were either additive or less than additive.",

Earlier studies combining short acting drugs from these classes require multiple dosing and were associated with poor compliance. Availability of longer acting compounds allows once daily administration to avoid the inconvenience of a multiple daily dose. It was decided to perform a randomised double blind, crossover study with the long acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long acting ACE inhibitor lisinopril, given either alone or in combination in essential hypertension. Twenty four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg, and their combination as per a prior randomisation schedule. Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both the drugs individually or in combination were used if the target supine DBP below 90 mm Hg was not achieved. There was a significant additional blood pressure lowering effect with the combination when compared either with amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Five mg amlodipine and 10 mg lisinopril monotherapy achieved the target blood pressure in 71% and 72% patients respectively. The combination of 2.5 mg amlodipine with 5 mg lisinopril produced a much more significant lowering of blood pressure in a higher percentage of patients than that with an individual low dose.",

In the presence of peptidase inhibitors, i.e. thiorphan (3 micromol/l; endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor), captopril (10 micromol/l; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) and bestatin (10 micromol/l; aminopeptidase inhibitor); all three mammalian tachykinins elicited concentration-related contractions of isolated myometrial preparations. The rank order of agonist potency of the mammalian tachykinins in the presence of the peptidase inhibitors was NKA > SP = NKB, indicating that the contractile effects were mediated by activation of an NK(2) receptor. The NK(2) receptor-selective agonist, [Lys(5), MeLeu(9), Nle(10)]NKA(4-10), produced concentration-related contractile responses, while the respective NK(1) and NK(3) receptor-selective agonists, [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP and [N-MePhe(7)]NKB, had no effect either in the absence or presence of the peptidase inhibitors. The NK(2) receptor-selective antagonist, SR48968, produced concentration-related rightward shift in the log concentration curve to [Lys(5), MeLeu(9), Nle(10)]NKA(4-10). This study shows that tachykinins elicit contractile effects on human myometrium obtained from pregnant women near term, and that these effects are mediated by an NK(2) receptor.

Ogiku et al. reported that one such inhibitor, imidapril, significantly prolonged survival in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The present study was designed to investigate the effect of imidapril on cerebral blood vessels in SHRSP to clarify role of the ACE inhibitor in mechanisms of cerebral thrombosis and stroke. Imidapril was administered orally at 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks from the age of 7 weeks, and was shown to prevent the usual increase in blood pressure seen in these animals. It also delayed He-Ne laser-induced cerebral thrombosis and increased significantly the plasma concentration of nitric oxide metabolites (NO2/NO3). To confirm the association between nitric oxide (NO) and these effects of imidapril, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) was dissolved in drinking water and administered to the animals for 3 weeks. Four of six rats died from stroke when L-NAME was given alone. When imidapril (5.0 mg/kg/day) was administered with L-NAME, however, the animals showed no signs or symptoms of stroke. In these instances, therefore, the concurrent administration of L-NAME with imidapril reversed significantly the effects of imidapril. Intravenous injection of imidaprilat (100 microg/kg), an active metabolite of imidapril, also decreased blood pressure significantly and increased the plasma levels of NO2/NO3 after 5 min. Moreover, imidaprilat enlarged arteriolar diameters and caused an increase in red cell velocity and mean blood flow in pial arterioles after 15 min. The results strongly suggested that imidapril protects cerebral vessels in SHRSP by elevating the release of NO, thereby improving the cerebral circulation and reducing the tendency to thrombosis and stroke.", 
    "336": "The novel principle of vaso-peptidase inhibition is based on the simultaneous inhibition of two enzymes, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) by a single drug. NEP participates in metabolism of various natriuretic and vasodilatating peptides produced by atria and ventricles of the heart and endothelium (arterial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and C-Type natriuretic peptide). The orally effective vaso-peptidase inhibitor omapatrilate has recently become available. This substance reduced blood pressure in hypertensive patients in a dose-dependent fashion. It is tolerated as well as ACE inhibitors and seems to ameliorate mainly systolic pressure.", 
    "337": "It is of primary importance for the clinical cardiologist to keep in mind the parameters allowing an adequate prognostic stratification in post-infarct patients in view of making the best diagnostic and therapeutic choices. A diagnostic strategy, based on a pathophysiologic approach, should evaluate four aspects: spontaneous and stress-induced ischemia, myocardial viability, and ventricular arrhythmias. Spontaneous ischemia has an undefined prognostic value, especially in the thrombolytic era; therefore it seems reasonable to perform invasive procedures in patients who are not stabilized by an adequate medical therapy or with large jeopardized areas. In asymptomatic patients, a provocative stress test allows a more articulated decisional iter. It is preferably to perform the test by the most physiological exercise EKG, together with the echocardiographic imaging, after the acute phase. It has a high negative predictive value, but a low positive predictive value. The detection of myocardial viability is frequently performed, mainly in patients with large post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction. Among all the proposed methods, the echo-dobutamine test mainly allows to estimate patients in whom revascularization may result in more benefit. The role of ventricular arrhythmias as an independent prognostic factor is debated and has to be always considered in relationship to other parameters, particularly left ventricular function. Regarding the therapeutic strategy, the indications from recent trials, related to antithrombotic drugs, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, nitrates, Ca-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs, are emphasized.",

    "339": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) therapy reduces mortality and morbidity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Though, there are a few questions to face, in what concerns the ACEI therapy: patients selection, starting time and duration of treatment, pharmacological profile of the various ACEI and their therapeutic efficiency. We aimed to determine if early Perindopril administration in AMI, for three months, may decrease mortality and morbidity in selected patients (high risk and streptokinase thrombolysis).", 
    "340": "The association of obesity and hypertension is characterized hemodynamically by an increase in absolute circulating intravascular volume that induces increased cardiac output and total peripheral resistance that remains inappropriately normal. These changes constitute the hemodynamic basis for the increase in blood pressure in obesity. Obesity-associated hypertension is also characterized by an abnormal renal response, including increased renal blood flow and a rise in glomerular and interstitial pressures. These hemodynamic changes induce the following structural changes in the heart: enlarged left atrial, ventricular and aortic root diameters as well as increased posterior septal wall thickness and left ventricular mass. The hemodynamic changes in the kidneys generate higher glomerular volume and increased interstitial infiltrate, which may cause compression of the tubules and blood vessels of the renal medulla. Weight reduction is an effective tool in the control of blood pressure, and significantly reduces the metabolic and hemodynamic derangements that occur with obesity. However, since weight reduction compliance is difficult to maintain, pharmacological agents are often needed to control blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and alpha- adrenergic blocking agents may be the most appropriate therapy for obesity-associated hypertension since they intervene with some of the previously described pathophysiological conditions.", 
    "341": "We have known for 70 years that familial factors influence blood pressure level. Modern genetics suggest that 30-40% of blood pressure variation reflects genetic factors. We have known for more than 40 years that patients differ in their response to specific antihypertensive agents, with little insight beyond demographics into the responsible mechanism for the variation in that response. Only recently has interest been evident in attempts to bring these two questions together. Specifically, do familial factors influence the response to specific antihypertensive therapy? One example involves the attempt to use the response to angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as an intermediate phenotype. An analogous attempt involves recognition of the fact that ACE inhibition reverses many of the features of non-modulation- which is an expression of an angiotensinogen (AGT) gene polymorphism. The ESPRIT Study was the first to enroll hyper-tensive sibling pairs into a therapeutic trial, designed to assess responses to ACE inhibitor treatment with lisinopril. This pathway of investigation is likely to be very fruitful over the next several decades, to the point that 'pharmacogenetics' will be an element in selecting antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "342": "To assess the antihypertensive efficacy of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, perindopril, in the elderly, patients >65 years of age with supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) > or =90 and < or =110 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week placebo washout period were treated with perindopril 4-8 mg/daily vs placebo using a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group design. Of the 191 patients entered, 183 completed 8 weeks of double-blind therapy. Average age was 72-73 years. Supine and standing BP at the end of the placebo run-in period were 173/96 vs 168/96 mm Hg. BPs were measured in the morning, 20-25 h after the previous day's dose (ie, at the end of the dosing interval). In the placebo group, supine and standing diastolic BP decreased by 3-4 mm Hg, and systolic BP by 6-7 mm Hg. In the perindopril-group, diastolic BP decreased by 6-7 mm Hg and systolic BP by 10-13 mm Hg (both P < 0.01 vs placebo). These data indicate a substantial placebo response of particularly systolic BP in older hypertensives and indicate the importance of a parallel placebo-group to assess the extent of the actual drug's effect. Perindopril caused additional decreases in diastolic BP by about 2 mm Hg, and in systolic BP by 4-5 mm Hg. The extent of this drug-effect may be less in older vs middle-aged hypertensives.", 
    "343": "The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the angiotensin II (ang II) antagonist, losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril on haemorheology. Twenty-nine patients with renal parenchymal disease and hypertension were enrolled in the prospective, open, parallel study that involved a 14-day washout period followed by a 120-day treatment period. Patients were allocated randomly to receive either losartan 50-100 mg/day (n = 15) or enalapril 2.5-10 mg/day (n = 14) to achieve blood pressure control <140/90 mm Hg. Blood pressure, haemorheology profile and plasma fibrinogen concentration were measured after the washout phase and after 2, 10, 60, and 120 days of treatment. The data were analysed using ANOVA with repeated measures. Twenty-seven patients completed the study. Treatment with both losartan and enalapril was associated with a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in relative high shear rate whole blood viscosity, indicating an increase in blood cell deformability. In patients taking losartan, the increase in blood cell deformability did not result in a decrease in mean whole blood viscosity due to a concomitant, significant increase in mean plasma viscosity (P < 0. 01). In contrast, the improved cell deformability in patients treated with enalapril resulted in a small and statistically insignificant decrease in mean whole blood viscosity (P = 0.06; mean change = -0.15 mPa sec). The mechanism of the increase in blood cell deformability and the rise in plasma viscosity associated with losartan remain unclear. It is possible but unproven that the improvement in intrinsic blood cell rheology with losartan and enalapril may be the result of changes in cation transport systems and/or the consequence of the protective antioxidant properties of drug metabolites.",

    "350": "The recently developed and marketed angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy equivalent to that of other leading classes of antihypertensive agents, with superior tolerability profiles. The specific targeting of the AT1 receptor afforded by these agents has demonstrated more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than that offered by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These data notwithstanding, differentiation within the class of ARBs has been limited. With the accumulation of additional data with ARBs, it has recently become possible to make within-class distinctions, based in large part on the individual pharmacological profiles of the ARBs. To this end, absorption, distribution, half-life, dose response and level of angiotensin II antagonism are of special note. When these properties are viewed as a group, the ARB irbesartan appears to offer advantages beyond those attained with other ARBs. Irbesartan is well absorbed, does not require biotransformation to an active metabolite to exert its antihypertensive activity, offers a large volume of distribution, has a half-life that is sufficient to allow once-daily dosing, is associated with a strong and consistent dose-response and has been demonstrated to provide a level of angiotensin II antagonism that is statistically superior to that offered by some other ARBs. These pharmacological differences may explain the clinical superiority of irbesartan compared with losartan, the first member of the ARB class. As even more data on the ARBs become available, the ability to determine the advantages of specific members of this class will be enhanced, distinctions that already have begun to come to light.", 
    "351": "To find a more effective inhibitor than spinorphin (LVVYPWT), an endogenous factor derived from bovine spinal cord, we synthesized spinorphin analogues and assayed their inhibitory activity toward DPPIII among enkephalin-degrading enzymes. Tynorphin (VVYPW), an N-terminal and C-terminal truncated form of spinorphin, exhibited more potent inhibitory activity and an IC50 value of 0.086 +/- 0.05 microg/ml (n = 4), whereas structures smaller than four amino acid residues exhibited almost no or less activity, suggesting that a five amino acid structure containing a Tyr-Pro residue is essential for the inhibition. The inhibition of DPPIII by tynorphin was predominantly competitive and the Ki value was found to be 7. 50 +/- 1.19 x 10(-8) M on Lineweaver-Burk plotting. The inhibitory activity of tynorphin toward other enkephalin-degrading enzymes such as neutral endopeptidase, aminopeptidase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme was not as high as that toward DPPIII, suggesting that tynorphin is a specific inhibitor of DPPIII. In HPLC analysis, human serum cleaved tynorphin rapidly (38% of control at 2 h and background level at 4 h), but in the presence of leuhisitin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, tynorphin was maintained at the original level for 24 h. These results indicated that tynorphin had a more effective structure for expression of inhibitory activity toward DPPIII.", 
    "352": "In resistance arteries pressure-induced (myogenic) tone (MT) and flow (shear stress)-induced dilation (FD) are potent determinant of vascular resistance. We investigated the role of angiotensin II and endothelin-1 in FD and MT in resistance arteries and their potential change in hypertension. Flow - diameter - pressure relationship was established in situ, under anaesthesia, in two daughter branches of a mesenteric resistance artery (180 microM, n=7 per group) from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) or normotensive (WKY) rats. One artery was ligated distally, so that it was submitted to pressure only, while the other was submitted to pressure and flow. Drugs were added to the preparation and external diameter, pressure and flow measured continuously. External diameter (with flow) ranged from 150+/-3 to 191+/-7 microM in WKY (n=28) rats and from 168+/-6 to 186+/-6 microM in SHR (n=28). Flow induced a dilation of the non-ligated arteries which was lower in SHR (13+/-5 - 31+/-4 microM vs WKY: 5+/-5 - 44+/-4 microM). In the ligated artery, the diameter did not significantly change, due to MT. In the vessels submitted to flow angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (perindopril, 10 micromol L(-1)) increased the diameter in SHR (+11+/-2 microM) significantly more than in WKY (+2+/-1 microM). Angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) blockade (losartan, 10 micromol L(-1)) increased the diameter in the vessels with flow in SHR only (+6+/-1 microM). Angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) blockade (PD 123319, 1 micromol L(-1)) decreased arterial diameter in WKY only (9+/-2). Endothelin-1 type A receptor (ET(A)R) blockade (LU135252, 0.1 micromol L(-1)) increased the diameter only in SHR in the artery submitted to flow (by 6+/-1 microM). Thus FD was counteracted by a flow-dependent AT(1) and ET(A) receptors-activation in SHR whereas in WKY FD AT(2)-dependent dilation is involved.",

The benefits were observed early after the start of therapy and persisted long term. The benefits of treatment on all outcomes were independent of age, sex, and baseline use of diuretics, aspirin, and beta-blockers.

    "359": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibit the degradation of bradykinin and contribute to accumulation of bradykinin and NO, both of which may be beneficial for diseased hearts. To test this idea, we administered imidaprilat and cilazaprilat, respectively to the canine ischemic myocardium. In the open chest dogs with low constant coronary perfusion pressure (CPP, from 104 +/- 3 to 42 +/- 3 mmHg), coronary blood flow (CBF, 91 +/- 1 to 32 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min), fractional shortening (FS), and lactate extraction ratio (LER) decreased. Either imidaprilat or cilazaprilat increased CBF, FS, and LER with increases in cardiac bradykinin and NO levels. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors were blunted by either L-NAME (an inhibitor of NO synthase) and HOE140 (an inhibitor of bradykinin receptors), respectively. ACE inhibitors, on the other hand, are reported to attenuate the severity of myocardial stunning, which effect is partially attributable to bradykinin- and NO-dependent mechanisms. Further, ACE inhibitors limited infarct size following coronary occlusion and reperfusion. This infarct size-limitation was blunted by either L-NAME and IBTX (the antagonist of K(Ca) channels). Bradykinin is also reported to close K(Ca) channels. Thus, we concluded that ACE inhibitors attenuate both reversible and irreversible myocardial cellular injury via bradykinin/NO-dependent mechanisms. In experimental and clinical settings, the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors on the diseased heart may be attributable to these mechanisms.", 
    "360": "It has been demonstrated that antihypertensive treatment of hypertensive diabetic patients is quite effective in preventing macrovascular and microvascular complications and improving prognosis. Nevertheless, the target blood pressure level of antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (i.e., with early diabetic nephropathy) remains to be established. In this study, we evaluated the effect of intensive blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg) on urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive, type II diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. We examined the effects of a combination therapy using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus a long-acting calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and compared them with the effect of an ACE inhibitor alone. Thirty hypertensive, type II diabetic patients with microalbuminuria were treated with either an ACE inhibitor alone (group I, n=17) or an ACE inhibitor plus amlodipine (group II, n=13) for 32 weeks. With treatment, blood pressures in both groups were significantly reduced, and diastolic blood pressure was lowered to a much greater extent in group II (76 +/- 2 mmHg) than in group I (83 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0.05). Although the urinary albumin excretion rate was decreased in both groups, the decrease attained statistical significance only in group II (from 141 +/- 25 mg/day to 69 +/- 18 mg/day, p < 0.05); the extent of reduction in microalbuminuria during antihypertensive treatment was significantly greater in group II (50 +/- 10%) than in group I (14 +/- 13%, p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study showed that in hypertensive microalbuminuric type II diabetic patients, the combination of an ACE inhibitor plus amlodipine resulted in a more pronounced decreased in blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg) and a greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion than did use of an ACE inhibitor alone. This combination strategy should thus be a more effective tool for obtaining optimal blood pressure control in patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "361": "Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, mediates the controlled deletion of so-called \"unwanted\" cells. This review deals with the key features of this cell death program, showing that apoptosis is regulated by factors extrinsic and intrinsic to the dying cell. The elucidation of the possible interactions between these factors may be of major interest in preventing the progression to cardiovascular remodeling in patients with hypertensive disease. New pathways of research are emerging for drugs, such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, the calcium-antagonists, and the receptor antagonist of angiotensin II, all of which have beneficial effects on cardiovascular remodeling. This may be due to the direct effect of these drugs on the cell proliferation/apoptosis balance.", 
    "362": "Alterations in resting tone, maximum diameter, and dilator reactivity to acetylcholine (ACH) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were assessed in cremaster muscle microvessels of Sprague-Dawley rats receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril for 4 days and in untreated time-control rats. The transilluminated in situ cremaster muscle was superfused with physiologic salt solution (PSS) and viewed via television microscopy; arteriolar diameter was measured using a videomicrometer. Before agonist challenge, resting arteriolar diameter was significantly increased in captopril-treated rats. Although maximum arteriolar diameter (determined during superfusion of the cremaster muscle with Ca2+-free PSS containing 10(-4) mol/L adenosine) was not altered with ACE inhibition, the maximum possible arteriolar dilation was reduced in captopril-treated rats. Captopril administration reduced both ACH- and SNP-induced dilation of cremasteric arterioles compared with responses in control rats, although this was partially a function of the reduced capacity for dilation, primarily to SNP. These observations indicate that short-term ACE inhibition reduces both resting tone and agonist-induced dilator responses of skeletal muscle arterioles.", 
    "363": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may participate in the regulation of fibrinolytic function. In clinical studies, however, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan have failed to consistently affect endogenous fibrinolysis. Because such an effect may depend on the degree of prestimulation of the RAS, we have studied parameters of fibrinolytic function in 15 healthy volunteer subjects during baseline (day 1) and after 10 days of treatment with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT)/day (day 11). On the last day of the study (day 12), a single oral dose of 50 mg of losartan was given to the volunteers in addition to HCT and fibrinolytic function was assessed at the peak effect of losartan (5 h later). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly stimulated during diuretic treatment (1.35 +/- 0.21 v 0.34 +/- 0.06 ng mL(-1) x h(-1) [P < .001]) and further increased after losartan (6.39 +/- 1.16 ng mL(-1) x h(-1) [P < .001]). No effects of either the diuretic or losartan could be observed on tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen concentration and activity. However, 10 days of treatment with HCT significantly increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen (26.8 +/- 5.8 v 21.1 +/- 3.4 ng/mL [p = .037]). In addition, PAI-1 activity was also tentatively raised by HCT treatment (5.48 +/- 1.82 v 3.88 +/- 0.79 IU/mL [P = .067]). In spite of the marked further rise in PRA after losartan, the stimulation of PAI-1 antigen and activity was blunted by losartan (24.4 +/- 3.6 ng/mL and 4.55 +/- 0.99 IU/mL, respectively). Our results demonstrate that volume depletion induced by HCT treatment is associated with a rise in PAI-1. Acute administration of losartan is capable of blunting this effect, suggesting that the angiotensin II type 1 receptor may participate in this effect of angiotensin II.", 
    "364": "Different spectral methodologies for heart rate variability were recently shown to provide the same qualitative results in the context of passive tilt test. However, the impact of the method and the use of normalized power units in long-term ECG monitoring is still debated. Autoregressive and Fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectral approaches were applied to assess circadian modulation and the effect of beta-blocker administration in mild hypertensive patients who underwent continuous ambulatory ECG recording (n = 44, 51 +/- 12 years, 30 men). Spectral analysis was applied to 5-minute sequences and spectral parameters representative of each circadian period (24 hour, day, night) were calculated. In baseline recordings, FFT spectral method provided a smaller estimate of total and very low frequency powers. On the contrary, low- and high-frequency components were systematically larger with FFT. Circadian variations were in favor of an increased overall nocturnal variability but of a reduced low frequency normalized power with both spectral methods. Chronic oral administration of beta-blocker induced an increase of all spectral components except for an unchanged low-frequency normalized power, independently from the spectral approach. In spite of quantitative differences, the qualitative assessment of circadian patterns and beta-blockade effect by autoregressive- and FFT-based spectral analyses is equivalent. The low-frequency component of heart rate variability cannot be considered a reliable direct marker of sympathetic activity in long-term ambulatory ECG recording.",

    "366": "The aim of this study was to assess the antihypertensive activity of fasidotril, a dual inhibitor of neprilysin (NEP) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), in various models of hypertension in rats (spontaneously hypertensive rats [SHR]; renovascular Goldblatt 2-kidney, 1-clip rats; and deoxycorticosterone acetate [DOCA]-salt hypertensive rats) and in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Fasidotril treatment (100 mg/kg PO twice daily for 3 weeks) resulted in a progressive and sustained decrease in systolic blood pressure (-20 to -30 mm Hg) in SHR and Goldblatt rats compared with vehicle-treated rats and prevented the progressive rise in blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 57 patients with essential hypertension were included in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study and received orally either fasidotril (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 6 weeks. Blood pressure was measured during the 6 hours after the first intake and then at trough (12 hours after the last intake) on days 7, 28, and 42. The first dose of fasidotril had no significant effect on blood pressure. After 42 days, compared with placebo, fasidotril lowered supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 7.4/5.4 mm Hg and standing blood pressure by 7.6/6.8 mm Hg. Fasidotril, a dual NEP/ACE inhibitor, was an effective oral antihypertensive agent during chronic treatment in high-renin renovascular rats, normal-renin SHR, and low-renin DOCA-salt hypertensive rats and in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "367": "Angiotensin type 2 (AT(2)) receptors for angiotensin II suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in vitro, but their role is poorly defined in vivo. We reported that transient induction of smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis precedes DNA synthesis inhibition and aortic hypertrophy regression in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with the AT(1) antagonist losartan or the converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Although both drugs are equipotent in reducing SMC number, apoptosis occurs significantly earlier with losartan than enalapril. To examine the role of AT(2) receptors in this model, spontaneously hypertensive rats were given valsartan, an AT(1) antagonist, or enalapril, in combination or not with the AT(2) antagonist PD123319 for 1 or 2 weeks. Control rats received vehicle. Systolic blood pressure was reduced similarly by valsartan and enalapril but it was not significantly affected by PD123319. Angiotensin II plasma levels were increased (6-fold) with valsartan and reduced (80%) with enalapril but unaffected by PD123319. Valsartan significantly increased internucleosomal DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis at 1 week only (2.7-fold) and significantly reduced aortic mass (18%), SMC number (33%), and DNA synthesis (24%, measured by (3)H-thymidine incorporation) at 2 weeks. These valsartan-induced changes were prevented by PD123319. In contrast, enalapril-induced DNA fragmentation (2-fold increase at 2 weeks) was not affected by PD123319. PD123319 given alone did not affect growth or apoptosis. AT(1) and AT(2) receptor mRNAs were detected in the aorta by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Together, these results provide the first evidence that AT(2) receptors mediate vascular mass regression by stimulating SMC apoptosis in vivo, an effect seen during AT(1) receptor blockade but not during converting-enzyme inhibition.", 
    "368": "The aim of our investigation was to determine whether the presence of additional risk factors or type of hypertension (diastolic or isolated systolic) influences blood pressure (BP) response to treatment. The International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) study is a double-blinded outcome comparison of calcium channel blockade with diuretics in high-risk patients aged 55 to 80 years. Dynamic randomization between nifedipine once daily and hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride was performed to ensure that approximately equal numbers of patients in the 2 groups had each of the major cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension were also separately randomized. Atenolol or enalapril was the mandatory second-line drug. In 5669 patients who completed the 18-week titration, BP fell from 172+/-15/99+/-9 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) while receiving placebo to 139+/-12/82+/-7 mm Hg. Twenty-six percent of patients required 2 drugs, and 4% required 3 drugs. Patients with diabetes were the most resistant to treatment, requiring second and third drugs 40% and 100% more frequently than patients without diabetes and achieving marginally the highest final BP, for any risk group, of 141+/-13/82+/-8 mm Hg. Age, smoking, gender, hypercholesterolemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and existing atherosclerosis had little (<1 mm Hg) or no influence on BP at the end of titration, but all except smoking slightly reduced the initial response of either systolic or diastolic BP. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension were slightly more responsive than average to treatment. Our findings suggest that in patients at high absolute risk of cardiovascular complications from hypertension, the risk factors themselves do not prevent the recommended BP targets from being achieved.", 
    "369": "CONSTRICTIVE ACTIVITY OF THE RAS AND DEVELOPMENT OF RENAL DISEASES: Several studies have suggested that the constitutive level of activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and especially of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) which plays an important role in the kidney in determining intrarenal angiotensin and kinin concentrations, is genetically determined and linked to the risk of developing several vascular diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, and to the risk of renal function deterioration in glomerular diseases of several origins.",

Gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography was performed on a standard 1.5 Tesla system: TR 13.5, TE 3.5, flip angle 60 degrees, matrix 195 x 512. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was the standard of reference.",

The sensitivity and specificity of CR for the detection of 50-99% stenosis were 85 and 71%, respectively. With MR angiography one occluded artery was incorrectly diagnosed as a stenosis. Sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 94%, respectively. The difference between the accuracies of MR angiography and CR was statistically significant (P = 0.02). The accuracy of CR was lower in patients with renal impairment (70%) than in those with normal renal function (90%).",

    "376": "Chronic oral administration of l -NAME precipitates stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The present study investigated whether acetazolamide (an acidotic agent) given alone or in combination with an angiotensin blocker (enalapril maleate) offers any protection from NO-deficient stroke in SHRSP. We also examined whether protection from NO-deficient stroke involves activation of K(+)channels. Five-week-old SHRSP drank saline (group I), l -NAME (group II), l -NAME+enalapril (group III), l -NAME+acetazolamide (group IV), and l -NAME+enalapril+acetazolamide (group V). Within a few hours following onset of stroke, rats were attached to a blood pressure recorder. In subsequent experiments, to investigate the involvement of K(+)channels, glibenclamide and BaCl(2)(K(+)channel blockers) were included in the drinking solutions that were given to the SHRSP groups receiving l -NAME, acetazolamide and enalapril. Group I of SHRSP did not develop stroke. Group II, III and IV developed stroke in 12+/-2, 29+/-2 and 20+/-2 days, respectively. SHRSP from group V did not develop stroke. However, they died in 70+/-2 days. The glibenclamide and BaCl(2)administration failed to prevent this protection from stroke. In conclusion, concurrent administration of acetazolamide and enalapril prevents onset of NO-deficient stroke in SHRSP. These stroke-protective effects are independent of reductions in mean or systolic blood pressures and do not involve an activation of K(+)channels.", 
    "377": "This report summarizes our experiences on the protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, especially captopril and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker on radiation-induced pulmonary injury.", 
    "378": "In the first series of experiments, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were given a single dose of either 20 or 30 Gy of gamma rays to a 35 cm2 right hemithorax port, whilst shielding the left, contralateral, lung. Perfusion scans and autopsies were performed at intervals up to 12 months post-radiation. Three different ACE inhibitors, penicillamine and pentoxifylline were given as radiation protectors and their activity compared. A model of irradiation for total bone marrow transplant (BMT) was used for the second group of experiments. Male WAC/Rij/MCW rats received total-body irradiation and a regimen of cyclophosphamide (CTX) in preparation for bone marrow transplant. The modifiers were two ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and L-158,809, an angiotensin II (A II) type 1 receptor blocker. All drugs were administered in the rats' drinking water and all were well-tolerated.", 
    "379": "In the irradiated rats, pulmonary damage progressed from the presence of blebs and detachment from basement membranes of endothelial cells a few days after injury, to severe arteritis and interstitial collagen deposition at 3 months, and then on to severe pneumonitis and extensive pulmonary fibrosis at 6 months. Marked increase of hydroxyproline was also found in the lungs at 6 months. These morphological changes were associated with significant decrease of ACE and plasminogen activator activity (PLA) and a marked increase of prostaglandins (PG12) and thromboxane (Txa2), substances considered as indicators of endothelial pulmonary damage. ACE inhibitors captopril, CL 24817, enalapril and CGS 13945 prevented the markers of endothelial dysfunction. Captopril and CL 24817, which contain a sulphydryl (-SH) radical in their moiety and the AII type 1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, were the most efficient in protecting the lung parenchyma from the inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis. Penicillamine, an SH-containing compound with weak ACE inhibitory activity was also a strong antifibrotic agent but showed only modest anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, in the irradiated rats, captopril also reduced the incidence of squamous cell skin carcinomas and subcutaneous sarcomas consequent to the highest doses of radiation.", 
    "380": "ACE inhibitors and one AII type 1 receptor blocker were effective in protecting lungs from radiation-induced pneumonitis and the development of lung fibrosis in two models of rat radiation injury. In the first series of experiments (unilateral irradiation), those ACE inhibitors containing a sulphydryl radical were more effective than those without it. This observation led to the question of whether this protective effect is related to inhibition of AII synthesis or rather to some of the collateral pharmacologic properties of these drugs, such as anti-oxidation or protease inhibition. The AII receptor blocker, however, was shown to be equally effective, if not better, in its antifibrotic capacity than any ACE inhibitor with or without an SH radical, reaffirming the role of AII in modulation of collagen synthesis.", 
    "381": "A number of studies have reported that oxidant stress reduces the activity of isolated Na(+)-K(+) ATPase and Ca(2+) ATPase which are known to affect the cell membrane integrity. The aim of the study is to determine whether the administration of lisinopril is able to protect the membrane-bound enzyme levels in isolated guinea pig hearts and also ascertain whether or not a relationship exists between oxygen free radicals and membrane bound Na(+)-K(+) ATPase and Ca(2+) ATPase. Forty guinea pig hearts were studied in an isolated Krebs-Henseleit solution-perfused Langendorff cardiac model. In all groups cardioplegic arrest was achieved by administering St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution (STHCS). Group 1 (control, n=10) received only STHCS. Group 2 (n=10) were arrested with lisinopril (l micromol l(-1)) added STHCS. Group 3 (n=10) were pretreated with oral lisinopril (0.2 mg kg(-1) twice a day) for 10 days and then arrested with STHCS. Group 4 were also pretreated with oral lisinopril (0.2 mg kg(-1) twice a day for 10 days), arrested with STHCS and reperfused with lisinopril added to Krebs-Henseleit solution (l micromol l(-1)). Hearts were subjected to normothermic global ischaemia for 90 min and then reperfused at 37 degrees C. Pretreatment and addition of lisinopril in the reperfusion buffer improved the levels of membrane-bound enzymes. When the treated groups were compared with control hearts, the best results were achieved in group 4. The Na(+)-K(+) and Ca(2+) ATPase levels increased from 466.38+/-5.99 to 560.12+/-18.02 and 884.69+/-9.13 to 1287.71+/-13.01 nmolPi mg(-1) protein h(-1) respectively (p<0.05). These results suggest that lisinopril protects the cell membrane integrity and lessens free radical-induced oxidant stress.", 
    "382": "This study compares left ventricular global function in 55 patients (25 with hypertrophy and 30 without hypertrophy) with essential hypertension, whose blood pressure had been stable for longer than 1 year, with that in 35 healthy subjects. Left ventricular global function was calculated using the echocardiographic Doppler index as described by Tei et al. (Tei index). No significant differences were observed in echocardiographic left ventricular systolic function between the three groups. Left ventricular global function differed significantly between the three groups, however, suggesting impaired left ventricular global function even in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Similar changes were observed in the ratio of peak velocity of atrial systole to peak velocity of early diastole during left ventricular inflow waveform (A/E), indicating that this disorder mainly reflects impaired left ventricular diastolic function. Unlike A/E, the Tei index is not affected by increasing age, and, therefore, is appropriate for evaluating left ventricular global function in hypertensive patients, most of whom are middle-aged or older. This index may be useful for determining treatment strategy and evaluating treatment effects.", 
    "383": "We sought to evaluate the possible interaction between the adenosine and angiotensin systems in the regulation of renal microcirculation in humans. Twenty normotensive patients entered the study. Ten patients (group 1) were pretreated with 50 mg of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, whereas 10 patients (group 2) were pretreated with placebo. Incremental doses of adenosine (from 10(-5) to 1 mg) were injected into a renal artery to all patients at 5-min intervals. Adenosine injection reduced mean renal blood flow velocity in both groups (from 17.3+/-2.8 and 16.7+/-2 cm/s to 5.1+/-1.1 and 3.8+/-0.8 cm/s, in groups 1 and 2, respectively). The decrease in flow velocity was immediate after adenosine, and its duration was proportional to dosage (y = 3.05 x -2.7; R2 = 0.46; p < 0.01). However, group 1 had a slope of regression lower than group 2 (2.37 vs. 3.82 s; p < 0.03). The index of renal resistance (mean arterial pressure/mean blood flow velocity) increased linearly in both groups with adenosine, but group I showed a lower slope of increment (2.77 vs. 5.57 mm Hg/cm/s; p < 0.01). Adenosine administration induced a marked and transient increase in human renal resistance. This vasoconstrictive effect of adenosine was blunted by captopril pretreatment.", 
    "384": "In vitro experiments suggest that beta blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may protect the failing heart by reduction of myocardial oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis in an in vivo model, the beta blocker metoprolol (350 mg) and the ACE inhibitor ramipril (1 mg) were given either alone or in combination to rats (per kilogram body weight per day) for 6 weeks after myocardial infarction. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), contractile function of papillary muscles, enzymatic antioxidative defense (indicated by the activities of the superoxide dismutase isoenzymes and glutathione peroxidase), and the extent of lipid peroxidation were studied. Placebo-treated rats showed cardiac hypertrophy, increased LVEDP, lower rates of contraction and relaxation, as well as a deficit in the myocardial antioxidative defense associated with increased lipid peroxide levels, when compared with sham-operated animals. Combined beta blockade and ACE inhibition improved the antioxidative defense, reduced hypertrophy and LVEDP, and enhanced rates of contraction. Thus prolonged beta blockade and ACE inhibition after infarction may decrease myocardial oxidative stress and thereby could be beneficial in heart failure.", 
    "385": "In children with large left-to-right shunts secondary to congenital heart defects the imbalance between the pulmonary and systemic perfusion may lead to circulatory congestion with clinical signs similar to those of heart failure. The circulatory function in this state was evaluated by using the invasive measurements performed during cardiac catheterisations in n = 64 young patients with ventricular septal defect (n = 56) or complete atrioventricular septal defect (n = 8) aging 0.1-23.7 years (median 1.1 years). The mean shunt ratio was Qp/Qs = 2.4 (range 1-8). With increasing shunt ratio the pulmonary perfusion raised (r = 0.84), but the systemic output dropped significantly (r = -0.77) while the total cardiac output (Qp + Qs) increased slightly not exceeding 141/min/m2. In infants, the systemic hypoperfusion affects the hemoglobin content: Hb = 14.9-1.01 x Qs, r = 0.63, p < 0.01. This may be due to the diminished oxygen extraction reserve of 46%. With dropping systemic output, the vascular resistance increases and the mean aortic pressure (MAP) remains normal. The actual pressure values layed near to the curve of the normal aortic pressure calculated as MAP = Qs x Rs. This pressure-flow-resistance diagram was used to interpret the effects of vasodilators established by 7 studies: ACE-Inhibitors, Hydralazine, and Na-Nitroprusside reduce the vascular resistance effectively but induce hypotension, because the systemic output fails to increase. In the chronic circulatory congestion secondary to a large intracardiac left-to-right shunt the pulmonary perfusion increases with the shunt ratio but the systemic output decreases and the total cardiac output is limited to a maximum of 141/min/m2. In this state vasodilators cause systemic hypotension thus offering no acceptable therapeutic option.", 
    "386": "Symptomless dysphagia and swallowing disorders play a very important role in the pathogenesis of aspiration pneumonia. A videofluoroscopic examination and a simple two-step swallowing provocation test (STS-SPT) could be useful for detection of swallowing disorders in elderly patients with stroke, however, there is no report on such a test for detection of symptomless dysphagia. We administered 1 ml Technetium Tin Colloid (99mTC) to the patient during sleep via a nasal catheter placed in the mouth. At 09:00 h the next day, symptomless dysphagia was checked for by imaging. Improvement of the symptomless dysphagia was observed, and thus we could prevent the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia. The 99mTC test was particularly useful in detecting symptomless dysphagia in elderly patients with stroke.",

The mechanisms of tilt-induced changes in autonomic tone were assessed using spectral analysis of heart rate variability. The patients were followed-up for one year.", 
    "389": "Positive results of tilt-test occurred in 4 (10%) controls and 13 (33%) AMI patients (P = 0.01). No significant differences in sympathovagal interaction (assessed by a low frequency/high frequency ratio) were detected between the groups before tilting (2. 9 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.1 +/- 2.2; NS). However, dynamic changes of this parameter differed significantly during the first 5 symptomless minutes of the active phase of tilt-test. The ratio increased in the majority of controls (87%) and decreased in the majority of patients (62%) (P < 0.0001). During one year follow-up, syncope or presyncope occurred in 10 (25%) AMI patients but did not occur in any control subject (P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of an early tilt-test after AMI for the prediction of syncope or presyncope was 70%, 80% and 78%, respectively.",

It has recently been shown that deteriorating renal function and substantial graft loss were observed in 55% of renal allograft recipients with recurrent IgA nephropathy (IgAN) at long-term follow-up. To gain a useful insight into the therapeutic approach towards protecting allograft kidneys from deteriorating graft function, we compared the histological characteristics of post-transplant IgAN to primary IgAN and investigated the effects of an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "392": "Twenty-one patients with post-transplant IgAN and 63 patients with primary IgAN were included in the histopathological study. The effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in post-transplant IgAN was also studied in 10 patients.",

The rate of global obsolescence, and the degree of interstitial fibrosis in post-transplant IgAN were significantly greater than in primary IgAN (P<0.05). The degree of glomerular obsolescence and the severity of interstitial fibrosis correlated with the severity of glomerular lesion in primary IgAN, but not in post-transplant IgAN. In primary IgAN, glomerular diameter significantly correlated with the proportions of glomerular obsolescence, but not in post-transplant IgAN, suggesting that allograft kidneys may be in a hyperfiltration state. Both the blood pressure and the urinary protein excretion significantly improved after ACE-inhibitor treatment (P<0.001).", 
    "394": "In post-transplant IgAN, histopathological lesions indicative of acute inflammatory insults were suppressed, and glomerular hypertrophy, which may relate to haemodynamic burden such as hyperfiltration, was prominent.

    "395": "In renal extracts, some renin is present as \"high molecular weight renin,\" a heterodimeric complex of renin with the 46-kDa renin-binding protein (RnBP), also known as N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase. Because RnBP specifically inhibits renin activity, the protein was proposed to play an important role in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Using gene targeting, we have generated mice lacking RnBP and tested this hypothesis in vivo. In particular, we analyzed biosynthesis, secretion, and activity of renin and other components of the RAS in mice lacking RnBP. Despite extensive investigations, we were unable to detect any major effects of RnBP deficiency on the plasma and renal RAS or on blood pressure regulation. Contrary to previous hypotheses, we conclude that RnBP does not play a significant role in the regulation of renin activity in plasma or kidney. However, RnBP knockout mice excrete an abnormal pattern of carbohydrates in the urine, indicating a role of the protein in renal carbohydrate metabolism.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) led to a progressive and significant fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to the basal values at every time interval considered with a maximum reduction at 12th month for hemoglobin ( 17.04 +/- 0.21 vs. 15.10 +/- 0.42 g/dl, p < 0.0001) and at the 6th month for hematocrit (53.74 +/- 0.56 vs. 45.7 +/- 1.19 %, p < 0.0001). Serum erythropoietin levels were reduced significantly after the first month of therapy (13.56 +/- 2.7 vs. 7.48 +/- 1.6 mUI/dl, p < 0.05) after which no further variations were recorded. In the course of ACEi therapy, there was an inverse correlation between percentage reduction in erythropoietin values and those of hemoglobin emerged (r = 0.24, p < 0.05) and hematocrit (r = 0.39, p < 0.01). Indices of red blood destruction including haptoglobin, bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase, were unaffected by ACE inhibitors treatment, as was creatininemia and kalemia.

    "405": "We addressed this issue in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease by evaluating the effects of a 2-minute CPT (n=14) and a 30-second dive (n=8) on mean arterial pressure (MAP, arterial catheter), heart rate (ECG), coronary sinus blood flow (CBF, thermodilution technique), and coronary vascular resistance (MAP/CBF ratio). The 2 stimuli were applied at the end of left intracoronary infusion of either saline or benazeprilat diluted at the concentration of 25 microgram/mL. The rate of benazeprilat infusion had been preliminarily demonstrated to reduce angiotensin II concentration in the coronary sinus without affecting its arterial concentration. The changes in MAP and heart rate induced by CPT and diving were superimposable during saline and benazeprilat infusions. The decrease in CBF induced by CPT and diving during saline infusion was changed into an increase during benazeprilat infusion with a significant attenuation of the coronary vasoconstrictor response.",

    "407": "Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of angiotensinogen and ANG II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) mRNA translation in rat proximal tubules (PT) was examined to provide direct evidence for a role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in upregulated osteopontin expression observed following mechanical cell stretch. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) under Brevital anesthesia. In situ hybridization and Western blot analysis demonstrated angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) protein localized to PTs and upregulated in obstructed kidneys, respectively, confirming an increased expression of renal RAS in vivo. In vitro studies were performed to provide mechanistic insight into ANG II-dependent osteopontin expression following mechanical cell stretch, which putatively mimics the increased PT luminal pressure post-UUO. A cationic transfection method was used to introduce either angiotensinogen or AT(1) antisense oligonucleotide into cultured rat PT cells prior to 1 h of cyclic mechanical cell stretch. Northern blot analysis revealed that PT cells subjected to cyclic mechanical stretch with/without prior transfection with a sense oligonucleotide exhibited increased osteopontin mRNA expression compared with unstretched cells. Blockade of either angiotensinogen or AT(1) mRNA translation by antisense oligonucleotide inhibition prior to cell stretch was found to significantly decrease osteopontin mRNA levels 2.4-fold (P<0.004) and 1.6-fold (P<0.001), respectively, compared with values observed in control unstretched cells. This study provides evidence that stretch-induced upregulation of osteopontin mRNA expression is mediated, in part, via production of ANG II. These results lend insight into upregulation of osteopontin via a local PT RAS leading to macrophage infiltration in the tubulointerstitium in experimental hydronephrosis.",

    "413": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics represent the first line of therapy in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Inhibition of angiotensin II production is, however, incomplete with ACE inhibitors, due to non-ACE dependent conversion pathways. Moreover, some patients are intolerant to ACE inhibitors due to side effects or renal insufficiency. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may be an alternative to, or an additional treatment in heart failure. Preliminary studies comparing the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan with placebo have demonstrated improved haemodynamic parameters, reduced hospitalisation and mortality in patients with heart failure. Reduced morbidity and mortality have also been found with losartan treatment, as compared to the ACE inhibitor captopril. This paper discusses the role of angiotensin II receptor blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Some results from published studies and a short description of ongoing trials are presented.", 
    "414": "The model of hypertensive rat was established by using the method of abdominal aortic constriction, 33 male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: group A (sham-operated rats serving as controls), group B (hypertensive rats serving as controls), group C (hypertensive rats subjected to low-dose perindopril treatment, 0.1 mg.kg-1/d) and group D (hypertensive rats receiving high-dose perindopril treatment, 1.5 mg.kg-1/d). The drug was administered by gavage for 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment, mean arterious pressure (MAP) was measured via catheter in the carotid artery. The heart was taken and weighed to calculate the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight (LVW/BW). The ratio of medial mean thickness to mean diameter of lumen of aorta and superior mesenteric artery was calculated by morphometry. Concentration of angiotensin II (A II) in plasma and in aortic wall were determined by radioimmunoassay (PA II, AA II). Our results showed that both high-dose and low-dose perindopril may prevent hypertrophy of left ventricle and hypertrophy of the tunica media of superior mesenteric artery. In addition, high-dose perindopril may significantly inhibit hypertrophy of aortic media. The above effects of perindopril may be explained by inhibition on tissue renin-angiotensin system of both vascular wall and heart, but is not related to circulating A II (PA II).", 
    "415": "We compared the effects of atenolol (50 mg), amlodipine (5 mg), enalapril (20 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), and losartan (50 mg) given in once-daily oral doses on office and ambulatory blood pressures (BPs) in patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Each of 40 randomized patients was treated in sequence with two of the five agents (balanced incomplete block design). Treatment periods lasted 6 wk and were separated by a 3-wk washout period. Changes in BP from baseline with the study substances were compared through analysis of variance. Office diastolic BP, our primary outcome variable, was most effectively lowered by atenolol, with all four post hoc differences between atenolol and the remaining substances being statistically significant. Reductions in office systolic and daytime ambulatory BP were not significantly different among the five compounds. However, atenolol reduced mean nighttime ambulatory diastolic and systolic BP more effectively than did amlodipine, enalapril, or losartan (but not hydrochlorothiazide). Severity of sleep-disordered breathing and well-being during the day were not significantly influenced by any of the study compounds. Our findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that an overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is an important mechanism behind the development or maintenance of hypertension in patients with OSA.", 
    "416": "Little is known about the effect of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on the catecholamine levels in fowls. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic lisinopril dihydrate (Ld) application on the plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline and on the blood pressure. Lisinopril was given in different concentrations (25, 75 and 250 mg/l drinking water) to the white Leghorn chickens for 9 weeks, while the control group drank tap water only. Twenty-eight hours after the last lisinopril application, arterial blood pressure (BP), plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels, plasma renin (PRA) and plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities were determined. In all concentrations, lisinopril significantly increased PRA and decreased ACE activities. Arterial BP was decreased only in the group receiving high lisinopril concentration (Controls 119+/-10.27, Ld3 98+/-5.4 mm Hg). However, the lower lisinopril concentrations did not alter arterial BP compared to the control group. Plasma noradrenaline levels were decreased in a concentration-dependent manner (47-58%), but plasma adrenaline levels remained unchanged. The heart weight/body weight ratio was not changed in any of the lisinopril-treated groups. The persistent decrease in the blood pressure after lisinopril treatment was not directly related to a decrease of plasma ACE activity or plasma noradrenaline levels. Its mechanism still remains to be elucidated.", 
    "417": "In this study, we investigated the effects of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) on arterial blood pressure (BP), plasma noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) levels and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. L-NNA was applied with tap water (1 mg/ml) from the 3rd to the 8th week of age (group L-NNA1). In Experiment 1, long-term L-NNA application increased BP compared to the control group (group C1) (L-NNA1 = 131.4 +/- 6.3, n = 6; C1 = 82.7 +/- 4.7 mm Hg, n = 7) but decreased plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels and ACE activity (NA levels: C1 = 15.5 +/- 0.8, n = 7; L-NNA1 = 8.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, n = 7; A levels: C1 = 15.5 +/- 0.8, n = 7; L-NNA1 = 6.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, n = 7; ACE activities: C1 = 87.3 +/- 3.1, n = 6; L-NNA1 = 46.2 +/- 1.9 U/l, n = 5). On the other hand, in Experiment 2 (carried out under the same conditions and in age-matched chickens), blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline levels and ACE activity were found to differ in the control group (C2) (BP = 141.4 +/- 15.5 mm Hg, n = 7; NA = 1.1 +/- 0.4 ng/ml, n = 7; ACE = 57.2 +/- 5.3 U/l, n = 7) as compared to C1, while plasma adrenaline levels were similar. In this series, long-term L-NNA application (group L-NNA2) did not change the BP, but surprisingly increased noradrenaline and ACE values (values of L-NNA2: BP = 165.7 +/- 15.6 mm Hg, n = 7; NA = 9.3 +/- 1.3 ng/ml, n = 8; ACE = 149.4 +/- 16 U/l, n = 8) while decreasing plasma adrenaline levels. L-arginine addition to L-NNA treatment completely reversed plasma noradrenaline and ACE activity values. These results indicate the modulatory activity of an L-arginine-NO pathway on adrenaline release as well as on the renin-angiotensin system in chickens.", 
    "418": "The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on cGMP and cAMP concentration in the left ventricle and aorta after NO synthase inhibition by 4-week-lasting N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) treatment. Five groups of rats were investigated: controls, L-NAME in the dose 20 mg/kg/day (L-NAME 20), L-NAME in the dose 40 mg/kg/day (L-NAME 40), captopril in the dose 100 mg/kg/day, L-NAME 40 mg/kg/day together with captopril 100 mg/kg/day. Captopril completely prevented L-NAME-induced hypertension and LV hypertrophy development. Compared to the controls, cGMP concentration in the L-NAME 20 and L-NAME 40 groups was decreased by 13% and 22%, respectively, in the left ventricle and by 27% and 56% in the aorta, respectively. Captopril did not influence this decrease of cGMP concentration. Cyclic AMP concentration in the aorta of L-NAME 20 group increased by 17%. In the L-NAME 40 group, cAMP concentration increased by 17% in the left ventricle and by 34% in the aorta compared to controls. This increase was enhanced in rats given L-NAME together with captopril. Captopril alone had no effect on cAMP concentration. We conclude that captopril does not affect the concentration of cGMP, however, it has more than the additive effect on the cAMP concentration increase in the cardiovascular system during long-term NO synthase inhibition.",

    "423": "Current modalities of detection and management of incipient diabetic nephropathy in childhood and adolescence are summarized and the open questions outlined. In particular, the predictive value of microalbuminuria for later nephropathy in adolescents is examined. Microalbuminuria is not as strong a predictor as suggested in earlier studies - recent studies show up to 50% of microalbuminuria can revert to normal. We advocate that the association of well-established risk markers and promoters of renal injury, including degree and tracking of albuminuria, glycemic control, blood pressure changes, incipient retinopathy and genetic background, allow more precise assessment of the individual risk of developing nephropathy and the decision to start pharmacological intervention. The major impact of strict glycemic control to prevent the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy is emphasized, as well as the need for a multidisciplinary team to optimize the care of pediatric diabetic patients. We discuss other therapeutic options, i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), moderate dietary protein intake, and other drugs. ACE-Is may provide a second line intervention in a well selected, high-risk subgroup of microalbuminuric diabetic adolescents.", 
    "424": "A reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a primary characteristic of ischemic acute renal failure. The present study was undertaken to examine the roles of angiotensin II, tubuloglomerular-feedback (TGF) mechanism, and tubular obstruction for the GFR reduction in the post-ischemic kidney. Renal ischemia was induced by occlusion of the bilateral renal arteries for 60 min, and renal function was examined at 2 and 24 h after the onset of reflow. After the end of 2-h reflow, the GFR was not significantly changed, but the urine flow increased significantly. On the other hand, at the end of 24-h reflow, the GFR and urine flow decreased markedly along with increased filtration fraction. The renal blood flow significantly decreased at 24 h, but not 2 h, after reflow, which was accompanied by increased total renal vascular resistance. Furosemide infusion (1 mg/min/kg) after 24 h of reflow prevented the reduction in GFR and filtration fraction without no changes in renal blood flow and total renal vascular resistance. Pretreatment of enalapril and losartan did not prevent the reduction in GFR, indicating that angiotensin II was not involved. In morphological examinations, tubular obstruction was seen in the proximal and distal tubules of kidneys both at 2 and 24 h after the onset of reflow. In two rabbits subjected to 48 h of reflow, the tubular obstruction was not observed, despite GFR remained depressed. These results suggest that the late reduction in GFR in postischemic kidneys is not mediated by angiotensin II, but is mediated, at least in part, by the TGF mechanism. The tubular obstruction may be not prerequisite for the GFR reduction in rabbits.", 
    "425": "Within the frame of the 2nd Iberian Congress of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (University of the Basque Country, Leioa, June 1998) a workshop was held about the use of biomarkers in marine pollution monitoring. Among others, the following biomarkers received special attention: metallothionein induction, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cytochrome P450 system induction, imposex, lysosomal enlargement and lysosomal membrane destabilisation, and peroxisome proliferation. These biomarkers can be used to evaluate exposure to and effect of different contaminants (metals, organic xenobiotics and organometallic compounds) and they can be measured using different methodological approaches (biochemistry, cytochemistry, immunochemical methods based on the use of biotechnology). Before the application of a set of biomarkers in pollution monitoring programmes, well-defined protocols of Quality Assurance have to be established to allow adequate comparison of results. It is also necessary to include analysis of standard reference materials and to obtain detailed knowledge of basal values and seasonal variations of the biomarkers in various species, as well as to integrate the information obtained with the different biomarkers. Marine bivalve molluscs such as mussels are appropriate sentinel species for most of the biomarkers proposed except for the induction of the cytochrome P450 system, which should be measured in fish, and the degree of imposex, which is a biomarker of exposure to TBT specifically measured in certain gastropod molluscs. As a result of the workshop, a battery of biomarkers of contaminant exposure and effects are proposed that could be incorporated into programmes monitoring the quality of the coastal environment in the Iberian Peninsula. These measures would be undertaken in conjunction with chemical measures of contaminant burdens in selected sentinel species.", 
    "426": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) block degradation of bradykinin, and bradykinin stimulates prostacyclin synthesis. Therefore, we set out to determine whether the effects of ACE inhibitors on prostaglandin production in essential hypertensive patients are class effects or are dependent on ACE inhibitor structure. In addition, we studied whether hypertensives show an impaired capacity to synthesize vasodilator prostaglandins. To address these questions, we compared the effects of captopril (sulfhydryl-containing inhibitor), enalapril and ramipril (carboxyl-containing inhibitors) and fosinopril (phosphoryl-containing inhibitor) on blood pressure and urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1-alpha (the breakdown product of prostacyclin) in 44 mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive subjects before and 8 weeks after administration of an ACEI. We also studied prostacyclin excretion in 15 normotensive healthy controls. Levels of urinary 6-keto-PGF1-alpha (pg/ml) were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Hypertensive subjects showed a lower excretion of 6-keto-PGF1-alpha than normotensive controls (212+/-147 vs 353+/-98 pg/ml, p < 0.001). All ACEI induced a significant decrease in MAP and increased the rate of excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite: C, 211+/-200 to 338+/-250 pg/ml, p < 0.05; E, 202+/-133 to 296+/-207 pg/ml, p < 0.05; R, 205+/-127 to 342+/-211 pg/ml, p < 0.05; F, 235+/-128 to 347+/-241 pg/ml, p < 0.05. In hypertensives (n = 44) the decrease in blood pressure correlated negatively with the rise in 6-keto-PGF1-alpha excretion (r = -0.51, p < 0.001). These data suggest that impaired prostacyclin biosynthesis in hypertensive patients could account for haemodynamic changes leading to the hypertensive state. Moreover, the hypotensive mechanisms of ACEI may be mediated by an increase in prostacyclin production; this effect seems to be class-dependent.", 
    "427": "In this study the effects of once daily administration of 10 mg fosinopril on blood pressure response to mental and physical stress were evaluated in mild to moderate essential hypertension. A total of 25 patients (14 women, 9 men) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were enrolled in this study. Before the treatment and after 10 mg/day fosinopril treatment for 2 months, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at rest and while performing a mental arithmetic test. In addition, exercise stress testing with Bruce protocol were performed before and after the treatment and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at rest and during peak exercise. Statistical analysis were done by using the paired t-test. During the mental arithmetic test, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively) after 2 months fosinopril treatment. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also significantly reduced during the exercise stress test (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05) after the treatment. Heart rate did not change during either the mental arithmetic or the exercise test. As a result, once daily 10 mg fosinopril may be effective in reducing blood pressure, not only at rest, but also during stressful situations.",

    "439": "The role of lipoprotein oxidation in promoting atherosclerosis is gaining recognition as its spectrum of effects is being unveiled. Accelerated atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Treatment with ACE inhibitors reduces oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-ox) in hypertensive subjects, however, their effect on LDL-ox in diabetic patients is yet obscure. To evaluate the effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine on LDL oxidation in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. A randomized single blinded cross-over study was conducted on 24 nonobese, metabolically stable, normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes who were randomly allocated to receive either enalapril, 10 mg/day, or nifedipine, 30 mg/day, for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week washout period. They were then crossed over to a 4-week course with the alternate drug. The oxidation of LDL was evaluated by three methods: dialdehyde analysis using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay with and without the addition of CuSO(4) as well as determination of conjugated dienes in the LDL lipid extract. The propensity of the serum to oxidize LDL was reduced by enalapril by 17-28% depending on the laboratory method used (P=0.0001). Treatment with nifedipine resulted in a rise in LDL-ox of 7-11% as compared to baseline (P<0.05). The difference between the effects of enalapril and nifedipine was statistically significant with all three laboratory methods used (P=0.0001). Both drugs were equally effective in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting HbA(1c) levels and lipid profile. The albumin excretion rate was significantly reduced during treatment with enalapril returning to baseline levels during the washout period and the nifedipine treatment course. Our findings suggest that oxidation of LDL is attenuated by ACE inhibition and augmented by some calcium channel blockers. This observation may contribute insight into the underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibition in diabetic patients.", 
    "440": "Epidemiologic studies have shown an important increase in the high mortality of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) despite optimal medical management. Ventricular arrhythmia was recognized as the most common cause of death in this population. Electrolyte imbalance, myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular dysfunction, and inappropriate neurohumoral activation are presumed responsible for sudden cardiac death. In this study, we focused on the deleterious effects of the overproduction of aldosterone that occurs in patients with CHF. Secondary hyperaldersteronism can be part of several factors thought to be responsible for sudden cardiac death. We randomized 35 patients (32 men, aged 48 +/- 9 years) with systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 33 +/- 5%) and New York Heart Association class III CHF secondary to dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy into 2 groups. The treatment group received spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist, along with standard medical management using furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and digoxin. The control group received only the standard medical treatment. Holter monitoring was used to assess the severity of ventricular arrhythmia. After 20 weeks, patients who received spironolactone had a reduced hourly frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) (65 +/- 18 VPCs/hour at week 0 and 17 +/- 9 VPCs/hour at week 16) and episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (3.0 +/- 0.8 episodes of VT/24-hour period at week 0, and 0.6 +/- 0.3 VT/24-hour period at week 16). During monitored treadmill exercise, a significant improvement in ventricular arrhythmia was found in the group receiving spironolactone (39 +/- 10 VPCs at week 0, and 6 +/- 2 VPCs at week 16). These findings suggest that aldosterone may contribute to the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with CHF, and spironolactone helps reduce this complication.",

We hypothesized 1) that ventilation (V) would be greater in conscious SHR than in control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 2) that intravenous infusion of the ANG II-receptor blocker saralasin would depress respiration in SHR, but not in WKY. Respiration and oxygen consumption (VO(2)) were measured in conscious aged-matched groups (n = 16) of adult female SHR and WKY. For protocol 1, rats were habituated to a plethysmograph and measurements obtained over 60-75 min. After installation of chronic intravenous catheters, protocol 2 consisted of 30 min of saline infusion ( approximately 14 microliter. kg(-1). min(-1)) followed by 40 min of saralasin (1.3 microgram. kg(-1). min(-1)). V, tidal volume (VT), inspiratory flow [VT/inspiratory time (TI)], breath expiratory time, and VO(2) were higher, and breath TI was lower in \"continuously quiet\" SHR. In SHR, but not in WKY rats, ANG II-receptor block decreased V, VT, and VT/TI and increased breath TI. During ANG II-receptor block, an average decrease in VO(2) in SHR was not significant. About one-half of the higher V in SHR appears to be accounted for by an ANG II mechanism acting either via peripheral arterial receptors or circumventricular organs.",

    "446": "In atherosclerosis numerous qualitative and quantitative changes in connective tissue metabolism parameters in serum and aorta occur. In atherosclerosis there is an enhanced activity of local renin-angiotensin systems. It leads to overexpression of ANG II, both in serum and arterial wall. ANG II stimulates SMC to over-synthesize the collagens type I and III. Hyper-cholesterolemia is a form of metabolic injury which can both induce phenotypic change of SMC and activate RA system in arterial wall. ACEI lower the accumulation of collagens type I and III, and enhance elastin content in arterial wall in experimental hypertension. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of captopril, enalapril and quinapril on connective tissue metabolism of the aorta in experimental hyper-cholesterolemia. 64 male New Zealand rabbits were used. Animals were fed with standard fodder, special diet (1% cholesterol content) or special diet + tested ACEI. Two doses of ACE inhibitors were used: 1st--equivalent to doses applied to human subjects (in mg/kg of body weight), 2nd--dose 10 times higher. The animals were divided into 8 equal groups: K--standard fodder, B--special diet, C1, C2--special diet + captopril in doses 2.5 and 25 mg/kg/24 hours, respectively, E1, E2--special diet + enalapril in doses 0.75 and 7.5 mg/kg/24 hours, respectively, Q1 i Q2--special diet + quinapril in doses 0.75 and 7.5 mg/kg per day, respectively. The experiment lasted for 6 months. After 24 weeks the animals were sacrificed and aortae were excised for collagens assay. The statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, followed by LSD test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The aorta collagens content of cholesterol-fed rabbits significantly increased.

Forty guinea pig (n=10 in each group) hearts were studied in an isolated Krebs-Henseleit solution perfused Langendorff cardiac model. The first group was utilized as the control group. Group 2 hearts were arrested with captopril (200micromol/l) added St Thomas Hospital Cardioplegic Solution (STHCS). Group 3 animals were pretreated with oral captopril (0.3mg/kg/twice a day) for 10days and then arrested with STHCS. Group 4 hearts were again pretreated with oral captopril (0.3mg/kg/twice a day for 10days) arrested with STHCS and reperfused with captopril added Krebs-Henseleit solution (200micromol/l). Hearts were subjected to normothermic global ischemia for 90min and than were reperfused at 37 degrees C. When the treated groups were compared with control, best results were achived by group 4. The Na(+)K(+) and Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ATPase levels increased from 466.38+/-5.99 to 564.13+/-7.77 and 884.69+/-9.13 to 1254.29+/-5.75 nmol Pi/mg/prot/h respectively (P<0.05). These results suggest that captopril protects the membrane integrity and thus played a role at the recovery of depressed membrane bound Na(+)K(+)/Mg(2+) ATPase and Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ATPase activity and also in ischemia-reperfusion injury.", 
    "448": "The quantitative measurement of gene expression requires consistent and reliable standards. At least two categories of standards, endogenous and exogenous, are currently used for quantitative PCR. The reliability of these two methods, however, has not been carefully compared. We hypothesized that a reliable quantitative PCR assay would be able to detect known dilutions of a given single-stranded (ss-) cDNA. By measuring VEGF ss-cDNA copy numbers or signal ratios of GAPDH/VEGF in 10x and 100x diluted samples of two original ss-cDNA preparations, an exogenous recombinant DNA standard (a VEGF-mimic plasmid) and an endogenously expressed GAPDH standard were tested for their ability to detect dilution factors. Using the recombinant DNA standard, the dilution factor was detected as 10.3 and 135.0 in 10x and 100x diluted samples of the original CaSki cell ss-cDNA, respectively. The detected dilution factors were 12.3 and 226.2, respectively, in 10x and 100x diluted ss-cDNA from U-251 MG cells. On the other hand, with the endogenous GAPDH standard, the dilution factors were detected as 2.7 and 8.0 in the same 10x and 100x dilutions of the original U-251 MG cell ss-cDNA. Using the same endogenous GAPDH standard, the detected dilution factors were both 4.8 in 10x and 100x dilutions of the original CaSki cell ss-cDNA. It was also found that the number of endogenous copies of GAPDH mRNA was about 1000 times higher than VEGF. The high internal lockup ratio of GAPDH vs VEGF copy numbers and the requirement for additional primer pairs make the use of an abundant endogenous standard an unreliable choice in quantitative or semi-quantitative PCR. In contrast, exogenous standard-based quantitative PCR was shown to be an accurate and reliable method for the quantitation of gene expression.", 
    "449": "Reduced activity of the endogenous fibrinolytic system contributes to intramural deposition of microthrombi in atherogenesis and to intraluminal deposition of thrombi leading to acute complications of atherosclerosis such as acute coronary syndromes. Endogenous fibrinolytic activity is predominantly regulated by the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). Increased activity of PAI-1 leading to reduced endogenous fibrinolytic activity has been identified as an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Vascular endothelial cells form a barrier between the circulating blood with its dynamic balance between ongoing thrombosis and fibrinolysis and the subendothelial layers of the vascular wall with their prothrombotic activity. In addition, endothelial cells synthesize and secrete substantial amounts of plasminogen activators and their inhibitor PAI-1. Thus, endothelium plays an important role in the regulation of endogenous fibrinolysis. After describing the components of the endogenous fibrinolytic system and its interactions, this review focuses on the impact on endogenous fibrinolysis by the renin angiotensin system, the kallikrein kinin system, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Investigations using transgenic and knock-out animal models--the results of which are also summarized--have improved our understanding of the interaction between endogenous fibrinolysis and endothelium. In each section of the review therapeutic implications and potentials are discussed.", 
    "450": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is the irreversible deterioration of renal function that gradually progresses to end stage renal disease (ESRD). The chief causes of CRF include obstructive uropathy, primary glomerular diseases, reflux nephropathy and hypoplastic or dysplastic kidneys. Progressive hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration causes increasing glomerular injury and further renal damage. Symptoms of CRF are usually seen when GFR is between 10-25% of normal. Children with severe CRF often suffer from failure to thrive, growth retardation, acidosis, anemia and renal osteodystrophy. Management of CRF aims at retarding progression of renal damage and treatment of complications related to renal dysfunction. Measures suggested to retard progression include protein restriction, strict control of hypertension, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and control of hyperlipidemia. Appropriate amounts of protein and calories are recommended to prevent growth failure. Nutritional supplements are often required. The availability of recombinant erythropoietin, calcitriol and human growth hormone has significantly improved the management of these patients. Once ESRD supervenes, renal replacement therapy in the form of chronic peritoneal or hemodialysis and transplantation is necessary.",

We point out the uncommon feature of this clinical presentation and the importance of bad prognostic factors presented by this patient. We obtained a good outcome by means of converting enzyme inhibitors and corticosteroid therapies: regression of renal failure and normalization of blood pressure. The generalization of renal biopsy practice would lead to a better knowledge of the incidence of this disease among Senegalese people. Indeed, renal biopsy is the main tool to diagnose glomerulonephritis and subsequently adapt the therapy aimed at preventing the possible evolution to end stage renal disease.",

Two hours after the initiation of a treatment with ACE inhibitor administered orally (lisinopril, Zestril), a circulatory failure in conjunction with an acute renal insufficiency occurred. Right heart catheterization disclosed markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance in the presence of a preserved cardiac index. Repeated fluid challenges and intravenous administration of norepinephrine failed to improve the hemodynamic status. The refractoriness of shock raised the hypothesis of a dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system, secondary to the treatment by ACE inhibitor. Accordingly, the patient was given angiotensin II intravenously (Hypertension) which markedly raised systemic vascular resistance, and result in subsequent regression of shock. The patient was discharged after an otherwise uneventful course.",

VEGF functions via binding to the VEGF receptors Flk-1 and Flt-1. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been suggested to reduce the microvasculature in resting and exercising skeletal muscle. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this reduction have not been investigated. We hypothesized that this might occur via reduced VEGF, TGF-beta(1), bFGF, Flk-1, and Flt-1 gene expression at rest and after exercise. To investigate this, 10-wk-old female Wistar rats were placed into four groups (n = 6 each): 1) saline + rest; 2) saline + exercise; 3) 100 mg/kg ip captopril + rest; and 4) 100 mg/kg ip captopril + exercise. Exercise consisted of 1 h of running at 20 m/min on a 10 degrees incline. VEGF, TGF-beta(1), bFGF, Flk-1, and Flt-1 mRNA were analyzed from the left gastrocnemius by quantitative Northern blot. Exercise increased VEGF mRNA 4.8-fold, TGF-beta(1) mRNA 1.6-fold, and Flt-1 mRNA 1.7-fold but did not alter bFGF or Flk-1 mRNA measured 1 h after exercise. Captopril did not affect the rest or exercise levels of VEGF, TGF-beta(1), bFGF, and Flt-1 mRNA. Captopril did reduce Flk-1 mRNA 30-40%, independently of exercise. This is partially consistent with the suggestion that captopril may inhibit capillary growth.",

Treatment with either captopril, enalapril or lisinopril reduced albumin excretion rate in comparison with control patients. A greater lowering of blood pressure was experienced by initially normotensive patients in the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than in the placebo group. Pooled end-of-study mean blood pressures for the treated group were significantly lower than for the untreated group, although this was not so for all individual studies. The apparent (treatment - placebo) 'effect' on systolic and diastolic pressures had a larger standard error for longer lasting studies.

    "475": "Endothelin (ET) antagonists do not decrease blood pressure in normal rats. Since angiotensin II (AII) and ET both induce smooth muscle cell contraction through the same transduction pathways we designed experiments to assess whether blockade of the renin angiotensin system would unmask a vasodilatory response to ET receptor antagonists in rats. For this purpose, we tested the effect on arterial blood pressure of the mixed ETA-ETB receptor antagonist bosentan or of the ETA antagonist BQ-123 in the absence or the presence of the AII receptor antagonist losartan. In control conditions bosentan did not affect arterial blood pressure. In contrast, in losartan-pretreated rats, bosentan induced a marked, dose-dependent decrease in arterial pressure (% change after bosentan 10 mg/kg: control -3 +/- 3, losartan -32 +/- 6; cilazapril -28 +/- 3). Similarly, BQ-123 decreased blood pressure in losartan-pretreated but not in control rats. Bosentan also increased the hypotensive effect of losartan in conscious, normotensive rats. The hypotensive effect of the combination of bosentan and losartan was not associated with any changes in cardiac output or heart rate, and thus was entirely due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance. We conclude that blockade of angiotensin II, AT1 receptors unmasks a vasodilator response to ET antagonists. This suggests that endogenous ET plays an active role in the maintenance of arterial blood pressure in rats which can be unmasked by a concomitant inhibition of the renin angiotensin system.", 
    "476": "Previous research in end stage renal failure has focused on the renin-angiotensin-system. Today, we know, that in chronic renal failure sympathetic overactivity plays a pivotal role for progression of the disease and overall prognosis. The unique finding is that the damaged kidneys send afferent nerve impulses to the central nervous system to increase efferent sympathetic discharge. Systemically this sympathetic overactivity contributes to hypertension and associated cardiovascular complications. Locally in the kidney neurotransmitter release is enhanced, which induces proliferation thereby promoting loss of renal function. Consequently, it has been shown that pharmacological inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity prevents glomerulosclerosis and ameliorates proteinuria in models of chronic renal failure. Thus, the pathomechanism of sympathetic overactivity is likely to open a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of hypertensive chronic renal failure patients.", 
    "477": "Cardiovascular effects of subcutaneous administration of synthetic alpha-lactorphin, a tetrapeptide (Tyr-Gly-Leu-Phe) originally derived from milk alpha-lactalbumin, were studied in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) with continuous radiotelemetric monitoring. Alpha-lactorphin dose-dependently lowered blood pressure (BP) without affecting heart rate in SHR and WKY. The lowest dose which reduced BP was 10 microg/kg, and the maximal reductions in systolic and diastolic BP (by 23+/-4 and 17+/-4 mm Hg, respectively) were observed at 100 microg/kg dose in SHR. No further reductions were obtained at a higher dose of 1 mg/kg. There were no significant differences in the BP responses to alpha-lactorphin between SHR and WKY. Naloxone (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.), a specific opioid receptor antagonist, abolished the alpha-lactorphin-induced reduction in BP and reversed it into a pressor response, which provides evidence for an involvement of opioid receptors in the depressor action of the tetrapeptide.",

Cu(I) derivative has been studied by IR, XPS and large-angle X-ray scattering (LAXS). IR data and the chemical shift of core level signals suggest that CAP is bonded to the metal via the sulphur atom and the carbonylic oxygen. LAXS data confirm this finding and are consistent with a tetrahedral configuration around the copper ion. The CAP molecule is bonded through the sulphur and the carbonylic oxygen and two water molecules complete the coordination around the metal. The sodium ion exhibits a tetrahedral configuration and interacts with the carboxylic group and two water molecules. One of these is bridging bonded between copper and sodium.

    "479": "The pharmacological characterization of EK112, a new combined angiotensin II and thromboxane A(2) receptor blocking agent, was examined in this study. EK112 was found to be a angiotensin II receptor antagonist, as revealed by its competitive antagonism of angiotensin II-induced smooth muscle contraction (pA(2) value of 7. 63 +/- 0.14) in rabbit aorta. It also had an angiotensin II blocking action in guinea pig ileum (pA(2) value of 7.87 +/- 0.67). Additionally, EK112 also possessed thromboxane A(2) receptor blocking activity, since it competitively antagonized aortic contractile responses elicited by U46619 and PGF(2alpha)(pK(B) values of 6.67 +/- 0.09 and 6.24 +/- 0.09, respectively) in rat. In contrast, EK112 did not affect the contractile responses to many other receptor agonists. EK112 did not mimic that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, to enhance the muscle contraction elicited by bradykinin in guinea pig ileum, suggesting that EK112 did not inhibit ACE. Neither cyclic AMP nor cyclic GMP content in rat aortic rings was changed by EK112. These data demonstrate that EK112 is a selective antagonist of angiotensin II > thromboxane A(2) thromboxane A(2) receptor.", 
    "480": "Adrenomedullin (ADM) has been recently found to directly inhibit agonist-stimulated aldosterone secretion by dispersed zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells and to stimulate basal catecholamine release by adrenomedullary fragments. In light of the fact that catecholamines enhance aldosterone secretion acting in a paracrine manner, we have investigated whether these two effects of ADM may interact when the integrity of the adrenal gland is preserved. ADM increased basal aldosterone output by adrenal slices containing a core of adrenal medulla, and the effect was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol. In contrast, ADM evoked a moderate inhibition of K(+)-stimulated aldosterone production, and the blockade was complete in the presence of l-alprenolol. The in vivo bolus injection of ADM did not affect plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in rats under basal conditions. Conversely, when rat ZG secretory function was enhanced (by sodium restriction or infusion with angiotensin-II [ANG-II]) or depressed (by sodium loading or infusion with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril), ADM evoked a sizeable decrease or increase in PAC, respectively. The prolonged infusion with the ADM receptor antagonist ADM(22-52) caused a further enhancement of PAC in sodium-restricted or ANG-II-treated rats, and a further moderate decrease of it in sodium-loaded or captopril-administered animals. RIA showed that ADM plasma concentration did not exceed a concentration of 10(-11) M in any group of animals. Under basal conditions, ADM adrenal content was 1.2-2.0 pmol/g, which may give rise to local concentrations higher than 10(-8) M (i.e. well above the minimal effective ones in vitro). ADM adrenal concentration was markedly increased (from two-fold to three-fold) by both ZG stimulatory and suppressive treatments. Collectively, our findings suggest that in vivo 1) ADM, in addition to directly inhibit aldosterone secretion, may enhance it indirectly by eliciting catecholamine release, the two actions annulling each other under basal conditions; 2) under conditions leading to enhanced aldosterone secretion, the direct inhibitory effect of ADM prevails over the indirect stimulatory one, and the reverse occurs when aldosterone secretion is decreased; and 3) the modulatory action of ADM on the aldosterone secretion has a physiological relevance, endogenous ADM being locally synthesized in adrenals.", 
    "481": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may be involved in early postoperative hypertension after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). As hypertensive episodes may be deleterious in the immediate postoperative period, we have assessed the effects of prophylactic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinaprilat in an open study. During steady state CPB, patients received quinaprilat 0.02 mg kg-1 (group A, n = 10), quinaprilat 0.04 mg kg-1 (group B, n = 10) or saline solution (group C, n = 10) as an i.v. bolus dose. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was given after operation when systolic arterial pressure was > 150 mm Hg. Requirements for SNP 1 h after arrival in the ICU were significantly less in groups A (two of 10) and B (two of 10) than in group C (eight of 10). Also, patients in group C had a greater systolic arterial pressure compared with groups A and B. There were no significant differences between groups in diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac index or cardiac filling pressures. We conclude that quinaprilat can be used during CABG to reduce the incidence of postoperative hypertension. Further studies of the efficacy and safety of this technique are necessary.", 
    "482": "In landmark clinical trials, pharmacological inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) attenuated the decline in renal function associated with chronic renal disease (CRD). Hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) attest to its central role in the pathogenesis of CRD. Angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonists (AT1RA) differ from ACEI in their effects on the RAS and on bradykinin metabolism. Elevations in bradykinin levels associated with ACEI and stimulation of angiotensin subtype 2 receptors resulting from AT1RA may produce therapeutic effects unique to each class of drug. Nevertheless, in animal models of CRD, ACEI and AT1RA exert equivalent renoprotection, implying that their renoprotective effects result primarily from inhibition of Ang II-mediated stimulation of angiotensin subtype 1 receptors. Clinical data comparing ACEI and AT1RA therapy in renal disease are limited to short-term studies, which indicate that AT1RAs have equivalent effects to ACEI on the major determinants of CRD progression, namely blood pressure and proteinuria. AT1RAs were well tolerated, with side-effect profiles similar to placebo. Taken together, available evidence suggests that AT1RAs will share the renoprotective properties of ACEI in human CRD. Nevertheless, the results of long-term clinical trials are required before AT1RA can be recommended as an alternative to ACEI in renoprotective therapy.",

The drugs are shown to correct water-salt metabolism. This is explained by better renal function due to speeding up glomerular filtration and increased sodium excretion with urine, and by activity of humoral mechanisms (inhibited activity of plasma renin, low plasma concentration of aldosterone and its 24-h excretion). Comparison of captopril versus ramipril demonstrates advantages of prolonged ramipril in respect to regulation of water salt metabolism in the treatment of essential hypertension in the Far North.", 
    "488": "Cardiac chambers have afferent connections to the brainstem and to the spinal cord. Vagal afferents mediate depressor responses and become activated by volume expansion, increased myocardial contractility and atrial natriuretic factor. Sympathetic afferents, on the contrary, are activated by metabolic mediators, myocardial ischemia and cardiac enlargement. These opposite behaviors may lead to activation or suppression of the sympathetic nervous system and of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As cardiac diseases progress, the heart dilates, plasma norepinephrine increases, atrial natriuretic factor is released and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is suppressed to maintain water and sodium excretion. This dissociation of the neurohormonal profile of cardiac patients, may be explained by coactivation of sympathetic afferents, by cardiac dilatation, and of vagal afferents by atrial natriuretic factor. In more advanced stages, atrial natriuretic factor suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is overridden by overt sympathetic activation and sodium and water retention ensues. Digitalis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers selectively decrease cardiac adrenergic drive. A common mechanism of action, to all three groups of drugs, would be attenuation of sympathetic afferents and partial normalization of vagal afferents. Consequently, heart size and cardiac afferents emerge as the key factors to understand the pathophysiology and treatment of the syndrome of congestive heart failure.", 
    "489": "Spironolactone, a competitive aldosterone receptor antagonist (ARA), has traditionally been the treatment of first choice in idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) and for preoperative management of aldosterone producing adenoma (APA). Spironolactone is partially absorbed, is extensively metabolized mainly by the liver and its therapeutic properties are attributable to active metabolite canrenone. At therapeutic doses of 25 to 400 mg per day, spironolactone effectively controls blood pressure and hypokalemia in the majority of cases. Endocrine side effect are often associated and mainly consist of gynecomastia, decreased libido and impotence in man and menstrual irregularities in women. Canrenone and the K+ salt of canrenoate are also in clinical use: they avoid the formation of intermediate products with anti-androgenic and progestational actions, resulting in a decreased incidence of side effects. Furthermore, a relatively new selective ARA compound (eplerenone) with reduced affinity for androgen and progesterone receptors, is currently undergoing clinical trials. In essential hypertension aldosterone can contribute to hypertension and increases the incidence of myocardial hypertrophy and cardiovascular events. On the other hand, inhibition of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) is associated with a decrease in blood pressure, with a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and a reduction of target organ damage. Thus, ARA have been proposed as complementary treatment associated to ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. Aldosterone is also known to play an important role in pathophysiolgy of congestive heart failure (CHF). In vitro and in vivo evidences suggest that aldosterone promotes myocardial fibrosis. This effect reflects direct, extra-epithelial actions of aldosterone via cardiac MR which are counteracted by ARAs in animal models. The RAAS is chronically activated in CHF. Non potassium-sparing diuretics further stimulate the RAAS and cause hypokalemia. Thus, use of ARAs in CHF was first proposed to correct potassium and magnesium depletion. At present ARAs are indicated in the management of primary hyperaldosteronism, in oedematous conditions in patients with CHF, in cirrhosis of the liver accompanied by oedema and ascites, in essential hypertension and in hypokalemic states. Its indication as adjunctive therapy of heart failure is currently under investigation. In fact, it is well known that even high doses of ACE inhibitors may not completely suppress the RAAS; aldosterone 'escape' may occur through non angiotensin II dependent mechanisms. Addition of spironolactone to an ACE inhibitor causes marked diuresis and symptomatic improvement. During the last few years, the RALES study (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) was organized to explore the efficacy of combination therapy with spironolactone and ACE inhibitor in patients with CHF, class III or IV NYHA. The study was stopped 18 months early because the results were so statistically and clinically significant that it would be unethical to continue the trial. It is reported a 30 percent decrease in mortality and hospitalisation for cardiac causes in spironolactone-treated group vs placebo group.",

In particular, the use of ACE-inhibitiors has led to significant improvments in the outcom/treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease and nephropathies. On the other hand, Ace-inhibitors are not specifically targeted to RAS since they interfere with an enzyme with multiple different substrates. Furthermore, the inhibition of ACE does not prevent the formation of angiotensin II through alternative pathways, and thus the inhibition of RAS is often incomplete, especially under pathologic conditions stimulating RAS. For these reasons, the recent discovery of angiotensin II receptors antagonists, which selectively inhibit the action of angiotensin II at the level of the AT1 subtype receptor, is particularly attracting. This article reviews the background, the rationale and some of the clinical findings and potential applications with this new class of compounds.",

The hearts were excised after infusion of cold crystalloid cardioplegic solution and stored in saline solution (4 degrees C-6 degrees C). In one series we studied myocardial blood flow and arteriovenous differences in oxygen, glucose, lactate, glutamate, and alanine during 60 minutes of postcardioplegic blood reperfusion. In this series captopril-treated hearts were reperfused with captopril-containing blood (1 mg/L). In another series we obtained biopsy specimens from the left ventricle throughout 30 hours of hypothermic cardioplegic storage and monitored tissue content of energy-rich phosphates, glycogen, glutamate, and alanine.",

Furthermore, captopril increased myocardial oxygen and glucose uptake during reperfusion (P <.001 for both), whereas lactate release and myocardial blood flow were unaffected by captopril. At the start of reperfusion, there was a positive correlation between glutamate release and glucose uptake in captopril-treated hearts (r = 0.66, P =.05). We found no statistically significant differences between captopril and control hearts in tissue content of adenosine triphosphate, glycogen, glutamate, alanine, or lactate during 30 hours of cardioplegic storage.",

All physicians and owner-managers of community pharmacies on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula were asked to participate in the study. Pharmacists who agreed to participate were asked to list patients of the participating physicians with prescriptions for (1) furosemide and digoxin with and without an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II-receptor inhibitor and (2) an ACE inhibitor. Physicians were visited by a pharmacist and asked whether each of their patients receiving digoxin and furosemide was being treated for CHF and to identify further cases of CHF among their patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. Intervention-group physicians received academic detailing on the use and dosage of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor inhibitors for CHF. Both groups were reinterviewed after three months to establish what if any changes in therapy had occurred for each patient discussed during the first visit. The positive predictive value of digoxin and furosemide treatment for identifying patients receiving treatment for CHF was 94%. Seventy-six percent of patients identified by physicians as CHF patients who were taking digoxin and furosemide were treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thirty-six percent of patients treated with an ACE inhibitor for CHF received the targeted dosage. Four physicians stated that the outreach visit influenced their prescribing, but there was no significant difference in ACE inhibitor prescribing between the intervention and control groups.

    "509": "The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of candesartan cilexetil are reviewed. Candesartan is an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB). It is administered as a pro-drug that undergoes activation during gastrointestinal absorption. The agent is excreted mostly unchanged and has a terminal half-life of about nine hours (slightly longer in the elderly). Candesartan differs from other agents in its class in that it is tightly bound to angiotensin II type 1 receptors, allowing prolonged activity. In clinical trials, candesartan cilexetil has produced a dose-dependent effect when given in dosages of 2-32 mg/day. Observed trough-to-peak blood pressure ratios support a once-daily dosage regimen. The antihypertensive effect of candesartan cilexetil 4-16 mg/day was as great as that of enalapril 10-20 mg/day and amlodipine 5 mg/day and larger than that of losartan potassium 50 mg/day. Adding candesartan cilexetil to hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25 mg/day and amlodipine 5 mg/day led to enhanced blood-pressure reductions and was well tolerated. It appears that candesartan can decrease renal perfusion without adversely affecting renal blood flow and may mediate a decrease in albuminuria in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. No clinically important drug interactions have been reported. Adverse effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and transient elevations in liver transaminases. The frequency of cough is similar to that seen with placebo. Candesartan cilexetil is an effective antihypertensive agent that can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. It is generally well tolerated and may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors because of cough.",

As a result of an intravenous administration test of both inhibitors in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) significantly decreased with the dose; the MAP reduction of 10.3 and 19.2 mmHg was observed at a dose of 50 mg/kg of AG fraction and 5 mg/kg of IVY, respectively. In addition to this behavior, the MAP gradually decreased after the 5 mg/kg of IVY injection (time to give a maximum reduction; 8 min), and the reduction was held for 20 min. By using rat and human plasma, IVY was found to be metabolized by the action of aminopeptidase in plasma to form a subsequent ACE inhibitor, Val-Tyr (VY).

To prevent these objections, a normotensive 4/6 remnant kidney model was elaborated and a subantihypertensive dosage of enalapril was used to evaluate its antiproliferative action. Subtotally nephrectomized rats (Nx) markedly increased the remnant kidney weight during a 4-week period and this rise was prevented by the treatment with enalapril (NxE) (Nx +297+/-35 mg vs. sham-operated +145+/-32 mg, p<0.001; NxE +154+/-35 mg vs. Nx p<0.001). While collagen concentration in the kidney cortex was not increased in sham-operated rats (Sham) in comparison with the control group (Ctrl) at the beginning of the study, the subsequent increase was significant in the Nx group and enalapril did not attenuate this increase (Sham 148+/-5 mg/100 g w.w. vs. Nx 164+/-2 mg/100 g w.w., p<0.01; NxE 161+/-4 mg/100 g w.w. vs. Sham p<0.05). The tubular protein/DNA ratio increase, which was significant in the Nx group, was inhibited by enalapril (Nx 26.2+/-10.5 vs. NxE 15.3+/-2.6, p<0.05). The protein/DNA ratio was much lower in glomeruli, with no significant changes in either the Nx or NxE groups. Serum urea concentrations were slightly higher in the Nx group than in the sham-operated group, but markedly elevated in the NxE group (Nx 10.71+/-0.76 mmol/l vs. Sham 6.10+/-0.33 mmol/l, p<0.001; NxE 28.9+/-2.6 mmol/l vs. Sham p<0.001). Creatinine concentrations in the Nx group were increased in comparison with the sham-operated group and markedly increased in the NxE group (Nx 63.7+/-3.56 micromol/l vs. Sham 37.2+/-2.84 micromol/l, p<0.001; NxE 107.0+/-5.2 micromol/l vs. Sham p<0.001).

Enalapril improved proteinuria in comparison with the Nx group (NxE 5.6+/-0.6 mg/24 h vs. Nx 16.1+/-3.4 mg/24 h, p<0.05). Thus remnant kidney proliferation is substantial even in normotensive rats. It includes both proliferation and collagen accumulation with partial recovery of kidney weight and function, but is accompanied by enhanced proteinuria. Enalapril attenuates the proliferation and decreases proteinuria but prolongs kidney function recovery.", 
    "520": "Cough is probably the most frequent symptom in chest diseases. Hence, a rational and economical diagnostic procedure is essential to prevent unnecessary costs to the health services, i.e. acute bronchitis, a self-limiting disease, which is the most frequent cause for cough should not involve extensive per case costs. History, physical examination, chest X-ray and lung function testing--which constitute both the first and second, i.e. the basic level of a stepwise approach--allows to diagnose causes in most patients with cough. Without evidence of the cause after completing this basic diagnostic procedure patients with acute cough may require blood gases analysis, electrocardiography, echocardiography, lung perfusion study, spiral CT angiography, bronchoscopy or laboratory examinations for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, aspiration or (seldom) pleuritis sicca. Chronic persistent cough (CPC) is diagnosed if the basic standard approach to chronic cough fails to lead to final diagnosis. Patients will then need further subtle diagnostic management, i.e. bronchial provocation testing, 24 hour pH probe, ENT- or neurological examination, high resolution CT of the thorax and bronchoscopy. We present two algorithms for the rational diagnostic approach to acute (figure 1) and chronic (figure 2) cough. Each algorithm considers spectrum and frequency of causes on the one hand, the positive predictive value, costs and patient discomfort due to the examination on the other. Nonetheless, despite extensive examination up to 20% of patients suffering from CPC the cause remains unclear [11]. Frequently, the capsaicin cough challenge test can reveal an idiopathic upregulation of the cough reflex as the hypothesised underlying condition. Psychogenic cough however, a rare condition in adults should not coincide with hypersensitivity of the cough reflex. Inconsistency and low reproducibility of results of the capsaicin challenge in patients with psychogenic cough preclude his routine clinical use. In conclusion, the very common acute bronchitis and the ACE inhibitor-induced cough do not require any other diagnostic procedure except patient history and physical examination. A simple basic diagnostic approach will usually allow to evaluate acute and chronic cough. In the remaining cases the proposed algorithm should be used for best results and to prevent excessive costs.",

Laser treatment of diabetic retinopathy is standardized; in most cases it can prevent blindness, provided the diagnosis is made in good time. Since impairment of vision is a late complication, systemic screening examinations are of particular importance if we are to reliably determine the optimal time for treatment. Advances in vitreoretinal surgery make possible the treatment of such late manifestations as vitreous hemorrhage and tractive retinal detachment. Provided that stage-oriented and timely treatment is forthcoming, these formerly hopeless cases should become a rare exception.

    "522": "Congenital C1-inhibitor deficiency, or hereditary angioneurotic edema (HAE), is a rare autosomal dominant disease due to alterations in the C1 inhibitor gene that results in a deficiency of antigenic and/or functional C1-INH. Affected patients are heterozygous, and their deficiency is incomplete, many of them having up to 20% of the normal amount of the inhibitor. The disease is characterised by recurrent, circumscribed, non-pitting, and non-pruritic subepithelial swellings of sudden onset, which fade during the course of 48-72 hours, but can persist up to 1 week. Lesions can be solitary or multiple and primarily involve the extremities, larynx, face, and bowel wall. Bradykinin is believed to be the main, but certainly not the sole, mediator responsible for the bouts of edema in HAE. The diagnosis is suggested by family history, the lack of accompanying pruritus or urticaria, the presence of recurrent gastrointestinal attacks of colics, and episodes of laryngeal edema. Diminished C4 concentrations during symptomatic periods are highly suggestive for the diagnosis. Further laboratory diagnosis depends on demonstrating a deficiency of C1-INH antigen (type I) in most kindreds, but some kindreds have an antigenically intact but dysfunctional protein (type II) and require a functional assay to establish the diagnosis. Prophylactic administration of either attenuated androgens or protease inhibitors has proved useful in reducing frequency or severity of attacks. Infusions of a vapour-heated C1-INH concentrate are safe and effective means of both preventing and treating attacks. Nevertheless, this treatment is expensive and this extract is not readily available. It is emphasised that administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is contraindicated in patients suffering from protease inhibitor deficiency states.",

After normothermic 15 min global ischemia, postischemic reperfusion of 60min was carried out. Temocaprilat and/or CV-11974 were administered from 40 min prior to the global ischemia. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), intracellular pH (pHi), left ventricular developed pressure (LVDevP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and coronary flow were measured. Twenty-eight hearts were divided into 4 experimental groups consisting of 7 hearts each: group I consisted of controls, group II was perfused with temocaprilat (10(-6)mol/L), group III was perfused with CV-11974 (10(-6)mol/L), and group IV was perfused with temocaprilat (10(-6)mol/L) in combination with CV-11974 (10(-6) mol/L). Groups II and III showed a significant (p<0.05) inhibition of an overshoot phenomenon of PCr during postischemic reperfusion compared with group I. Group IV also showed a more pronounced significant (p<0.01) inhibition of the overshoot of PCr during reperfusion compared with group I. Groups II, III and IV showed a significant (p<0.05) inhibition of the decrease in ATP during global ischemia (59+/-2, 54+/-3 and 54+/-7%, respectively) compared with group I (45+/-3%). Groups II and IV showed a significant (p<0.05) early recovery of ATP during reperfusion (81+/-2, 80+/-6%) compared with group I (71+/-3%) and group II (73+/-2%). Group IV showed no more significant recovery in ATP than group III. There were no differences in LVDevP, LVEDP and coronary flow among these groups. In conclusion, temocaprilat in combination with CV-11974 has significant potential for improving myocardial energy metabolism during both myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "524": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of all subjects with essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus enrolled in the PIUMA (Progetto Ipertensione Umbria Monitoraggio Ambulatoriale) registry, in order to evaluate whether the use of calcium antagonists is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk in these subjects. One hundred and sixty-four consecutive subjects with no previous cardiovascular morbid events and coexistence of essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied before therapy and followed for up to 12 years (mean 5). There were periodical contacts with family doctors and patients in order to ascertain the occurrence of major cardiovascular events. The use of calcium antagonists that preceded the event was considered for classification. None of the patients was lost to follow-up. At entry, the patients who were subsequently given calcium antagonists (n=50) had a higher clinical (174/98 vs 161/92 mmHg, both p<0.01) and 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure (150/90 vs 141/84 mmHg, both p<0.01) than those who were not. During follow-up there were 53 major cardiovascular morbid events (6.46 per 100 person-years). The rate of total cardiovascular events [5.6 vs 6.8 events per 100 person-years, relative risk 0.88 (95% CI: 0.47-1.61)] and that of cardiac events [4.0 vs 3.3 events per 100 person-years, relative risk 1.33 (95% CI: 0.62-2.89)] did not differ between users of calcium antagonists and non-users. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n=66) was unrelated to the risk of cardiovascular events (relative risk 1.24, 95% CI: 0.71-2.16). In a Cox multivariate analysis, only age (p=0.002) and 24-hr pulse pressure (p=0.04) were independent predictors of cardiovascular events. In conclusion, this cohort study does not support the hypothesis that use of calcium antagonists is associated with an excess risk of adverse cardiovascular events in uncomplicated subjects with essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "525": "Calcium antagonists are indicted as a potential trigger of a variety of complications spanning from myocardial infarction to bleeding and cancer. Three randomised controlled trials, the MIDAS, the FACET and the ABCD trial, seem to suggest that the risk for myocardial infarction is increased in diabetics on calcium antagonists. These trials in aggregate totalled only 92 cardiovascular events and it is possible that the observed differences were due to random errors. Most of the patients of the ABCD trial discontinued the medication to which they were initially randomised before the end of the study, which raised the possibility of systematic bias. In both the MIDAS and ABCD studies cardiovascular events were secondary end-points and the apparent adverse effects were identified only by subgroup analyses. Furthermore, in both studies, patients in the control groups were being treated with ACE inhibitors. The lack of a placebo group makes it impossible to establish whether the observed effects were due to the harmful influence of calcium antagonism or to the favourable effects of ACE inhibition. New data abstracted from the PIUMA database show that the rate of total cardiovascular and cardiac events did not differ between diabetics on calcium antagonists and diabetics not using these drugs. These new data are in keeping with findings in the HOT study where an impressive degree of cardiac protection was observed in diabetic patients on felodipine.", 
    "526": "The sensory neuropeptides substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) are localized to sensory airway nerves, from which they can be released by a variety of stimuli, including allergen, ozone, or inflammatory mediators. Sensory nerves containing these peptides are relatively scarce in human airways, but it is becoming increasingly evident that inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells can produce the tachykinins SP and NKA. Moreover, immune stimuli can boost the production and secretion of SP and NKA. SP and NKA have potent effects on bronchomotor tone, airway secretions, and bronchial circulation (vasodilation and microvascular leakage) and on inflammatory and immune cells. Following their release, tachykinins are degraded by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The airway effects of the tachykinins are largely mediated by tachykinin NK1 and NK2 receptors. Tachykinins contract smooth muscle mainly by interaction with NK2 receptors, while the vascular and proinflammatory effects are mediated by the NK1 receptor. In view of their potent effects on the airways, tachykinins have been put forward as possible mediators of asthma, and tachykinin receptor antagonists are a potential new class of antiasthmatic medication.",

    "529": "Patients who had board-certified cardiologists as attending physicians had the least number of comorbid conditions, whereas patients who had general practitioners or internal medicine subspecialists as attending physicians usually had the most comorbidities. Cardiologists had the greatest use of most guideline-supported therapies, and general practitioners had the lowest use. After adjustment for severity of myocardial infarction, clinical presentation, and hospital characteristics, patients treated by cardiologists were less likely to die within 1 year (relative risk [RR] = 0.92, 95%, confidence interval [CI]: 0.89 to 0. 95), and patients cared for by other general practitioners were more likely to die within 1 year (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.14), than patients cared for by general internists. After adjusting for additional measures of comorbid illness and functional limitations, the 1-year survival benefit associated with cardiology care was attenuated relative to internists (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.0), and the excess mortality associated with general practitioners decreased (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.11). After further adjustment for the use of guideline-supported therapies, both differences in 1-year survival between patients treated by cardiologists or general practitioners were not significantly different from those of patients treated by internists.",

    "531": "Excessive ethanol intake is reported in 3% to 40% of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). In the prevasodilator era, the prognosis was reportedly better in alcoholic than in IDC patients, an advantage limited to abstinent patients. No large series of patients systematically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has since been described. We analyzed long-term outcome according to alcohol abuse in male patients with IDC. Among 338 men who had been prospectively enrolled in a multicenter registry, 79 (23%) were defined as alcohol abusers and further classified at follow-up as having stopped (AAS) or continued (AAC) abuse. AAC subjects at enrollment reported a higher daily alcohol intake than AAS subjects (178 +/- 113 vs 127 +/- 54 g/day, p = 0.012). During a mean of 59 +/- 35 months, 102 patients died and 45 underwent transplantation. Seven-year transplant-free survival was significantly lower in alcohol abusers (41%) than in patients with IDC (53%, p = 0.026), and significantly lower in AAC subjects (27%) than in either patients with IDC or AAS (45%) (p = 0. 018). Although IDC patients had beneficial changes in left ventricular function at follow-up, only AAS patients had significant improvement in ejection fraction. In this large series of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and prospectively followed up, excessive alcohol intake was found in about one fourth of cases and persistent alcohol abuse correlated with a worse prognosis and function at follow-up.", 
    "532": "The antiarrhythmic amiodarone (AM) and its metabolite desethylamiodarone (Des) are known to cause AM-induced pulmonary toxicity, but the mechanisms underlying this disorder remain unclear. We hypothesized that AM might cause AM-induced pulmonary toxicity in part through the induction of apoptosis or necrosis in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Two models of type II pneumocytes, the human AEC-derived A549 cell line and primary AECs isolated from adult Wistar rats, were incubated with AM or Des for 20 h. Apoptotic cells were determined by morphological assessment of nuclear fragmentation with propidium iodide on ethanol-fixed cells. Necrotic cells were quantitated by loss of dye exclusion. Both AM and Des caused dose-dependent necrosis starting at 2.5 and 0.1 microg/ml, respectively, in primary rat AECs and at 10 and 5 microg/ml in subconfluent A549 cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). AM and Des also induced dose-dependent apoptosis beginning at 2.5 microg/ml in the primary AECs (P < 0.05 for both compounds) and at 10 and 5 microg/ml, respectively, in the A549 cell line (P < 0.01). The two compounds also caused significant net cell loss (up to 80% over 20 h of incubation) by either cell type at drug concentrations near or below the therapeutic serum concentration for AM. The cell loss was not due to detachment but was blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone. Furthermore, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (500 ng/ml) and the angiotensin-receptor antagonist saralasin (50 microg/ml) significantly inhibited both the induction of apoptosis and net cell loss in response to AM. These results are consistent with recent work from this laboratory demonstrating potent inhibition of apoptosis in human AECs by captopril (Uhal BD, Gidea C, Bargout R, Bifero A, Ibarra-Sunga O, Papp M, Flynn K, and Filippatos G. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 275: L1013-L1017, 1998). They also suggested that the accumulation of AM and/or its primary metabolite Des in lung tissue may induce cytotoxicity of AECs that might be inhibitable by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or other antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system.",

Additional benefits were a reduced risk of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients, and a lower likelihood of newly diagnosed diabetes. On the other hand, vitamin E in the doses and duration studied (400 IU/day for 4.5 years) did not lower risk significantly.",

Pretreatment with ramiprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, induced cardioprotection and its possible mechanism of action was investigated in guinea-pig Langendorff perfused heart. 2. Superoxide anion (*O2-), produced by hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, and the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical were used for triggering free radical injury in cardiac tissue. 3. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl and *O2- significantly reduced left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), +/-dP/dt(max), heart rate and coronary flow. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was elevated and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) formation were significantly increased. 4. Pretreatment with ramiprilat induced cardioprotection against DPPH and *O2- free radical injury. Cardiac functions (LVDP, LVEDP and +/-dP/dt(max)) were significantly improved. Both LDH and TBARS were reduced. 5. HOE 140 (a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist), calphostin C (a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor) and indomethacin (a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) all abolished the cardiac protective effect of ramiprilat. However, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, had no effect. 6. In conclusion, ramiprilat pretreatment induces cardioprotection against either DPPH or *O2- free radical injury. The protective effect depends on activation of B2 receptors and PKC. Prostaglandin synthesis is also involved.", 
    "535": "The objective of this study was to determine whether cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensive rats could be reduced and normalized by intermittent reduction of blood pressure, and to determine whether left ventricular hypertrophy was related to 24 h workload or peak blood pressure responses.", 
    "536": "Hypertension was created by the application of a 0.20 mm clip to the left renal artery. Blood pressure response was monitored using a telemetry system (Data Science International).

Captopril 75 mg/kg per day and captopril 15 mg/kg per day (intra-peritoneal) caused regression of cardiac hypertrophy whereas the other doses had no effect The best predictor of the cardiac hypertrophy response was the blood pressure between 0800 and 1200 h (i.e. the sleeping blood pressure). Twenty-four hour cardiac work did not correlate with the response.", 
    "538": "Cardiac hypertrophy can be reduced by intermittent treatment of elevated blood pressure. It is also caused by intermittent elevation of blood pressure. It appears that the crucial factor is when these alterations in blood pressure take place. An elevated blood pressure during the sleeping hours causes left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas a normal blood pressure during the sleeping hours allows reduction. It is suggested that acute wall stress is the signal to initiate the events that lead to cardiac hypertrophy but this only occurs if the hormonal milieu is appropriate.", 
    "539": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) cause regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by reducing angiotensin II, increasing bradykinin, or both. The mechanisms of these cardioprotective effects remain controversial. The aims of this study were to determine whether the cardioprotective effects of ACEIs are mediated by reducing angiotensin II and whether ACEIs ameliorate the morphologic, physiologic, and biochemical changes in the hearts of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs). Male SHRSPs were treated with hydralazine, captopril, or candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist, from age 12 to 24 weeks. We measured systolic blood pressure (SBP), left ventricular weight (LVW), left ventricular (LV) myocyte cross-sectional area (myocyte size), LV Interstitial collagen volume fraction (ICVF), perivascular collagen area/luminal area ratio (PVCA/LA), the medial area to luminal area ratio (MA/LA), the relative amount of V3 myosin heavy chain (MHCV3), and coronary reserve maximum (coronary flow max/ventricular weight (CFmax/VW)). These parameters were compared with those of untreated SHRSPs and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). SHRSPs exhibited decreased coronary reserve and LVH with an increase in myocyte size, PVCA/LA, MA/LA, and MHCV3 at 12 weeks of age. In addition to these changes, 24-week-old SHRSPs showed an increase in ICVF. The LVW, coronary reserve, myocyte size, PVCA/LA, ICVF, and MHCV3 of SHRSPs treated with captopril or candesartan all approached control values. In contrast, hydralazine decreased only ICVF. These results suggest that ACEIs regress LVH and normalize coronary reserve by modulating the effects of angiotensin II via AT1R on the induction of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, perivascular fibrosis, and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries in SHRSPs. We concluded that these effects, in addition to the reduction of SBP, are important in causing the regression of LVH.",

Fifty patients with supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95-< or = 114 mm Hg were entered into the active treatment phase of the study after 2 weeks of placebo run-in. Sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg OD was administered for 2 weeks, then optimally titrated, at 2 week intervals, to SR diltiazem 240 mg OD and then SR diltiazem 180 mg + ramipril 2.5 mg OD to achieve supine DBP < or = 90 mm Hg. After 4 weeks of diltiazem monotherapy (SR diltiazem 180 mg or 240 mg OD) mean supine DBP was reduced from 102.84 +/- 3.81 mm Hg to 90.15 +/- 5.02 mm Hg (P < 0.01) and mean supine heart rate was reduced from 85.15 +/- 11.02 bpm to 77.62 +/- 11.45 bpm (p < 0.01). Diltiazem monotherapy reduced supine DBP to < or = 90 mm Hg in 35/45 (77.77%) patients. Combination therapy (SR diltiazem 180 mg + ramipril 2.5 mg OD), received by non-responders to diltiazem monotherapy, reduced supine DBP to < or = 90 mm Hg in 3/10 (30%) patients.

    "541": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor (AT) antagonist on insulin resistance, especially on muscle fiber composition in fructose-induced insulin-resistant and hypertensive rats. Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either normal rat chow (control) or a fructose-rich diet (FFR). For the last two weeks of a six-week period of either diet, the rats were treated with gum arabic solution as a vehicle (control or FFR), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (FFR+ACE), temocapril (1 mg/kg/ day) or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (FFR+AT), CS-866 (0.3 mg/kg/day), by gavage, and then the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique was performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity. At the end of the glucose clamp, the soleus muscle was dissected for determination of the muscle fiber composition by ATPase methods. Blood pressure at the glucose clamp in the FFR group was significantly higher than that of the control group, and both temocapril and CS-866 significantly lowered the blood pressure of the FFR group. The average rate of glucose infusion during the glucose clamp, as a measure of insulin sensitivity (M value), was significantly lower in the FFR rats compared to the controls (15.4 +/- 0.4, 10.9 +/- 0.6 mg/kg/min, for control and FFR, respectively, P < .01). Both temocapril and CS-866 partially improved the M values compared to FFR (13.2 +/- 0.7, 12.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/min, for FFR+ACE, FFR+AT, respectively, P < .01 compared with FFR, P < .05 compared with control). The composite ratio of type I fibers of the soleus muscle was decreased significantly in the FFR rats compared with the controls (82% +/- 2%, 75% +/- 2%, for control and FFR, respectively, P < .01), and both temocapril and CS-866 restored a composite ratio of type I fibers to the same level as that of the controls (81% +/- 1%, 80% +/- 1% for FFR+ACE and FFR+AT, respectively). The M value was significantly correlated with the composition of type I and type II fibers. These results suggest that the fiber composition of skeletal muscle is correlated to insulin resistance, and that both ACE inhibitors and AT antagonists may modulate the muscle fiber composition in a hypertensive and insulin-resistant animal model, fructose-fed rats, to the same extent.", 
    "542": "Compared to the Lyon normotensive (LN) controls, adult Lyon hypertensive rats (LH) exhibit a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dependent hypertension despite a low renin secretion. This discrepancy could be explained by the elevated slow pressor response to angiotensin II (AII) found in LH rats compared to LN controls. To evaluate more precisely the pathophysiological importance of this increased response, the present work aimed at determining whether the characteristics of the RAS were identical in LN and low blood pressure (LL) rats, the other normotensive control strain simultaneously selected with LH rats. Plasma and kidney renin and prorenin were measured in 11-week-old LN and LL rats. Aortic blood pressure (BP) was recorded at 15 weeks of age in freely moving rats of both strains either untreated or having received an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (3 mg/kg/day orally) since the age of 3 weeks. Acute dose-response curves were constructed for AII and norepinephrine (NE). The long-term pressor effects of AII (200 ng/kg/ min) and NE (1000 ng/kg/min) were measured after chronic infusions in perindopril-treated LN and LL rats. LN and LL rats exhibited similar mean BP level before (114 +/- 2 and 117 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively) and after perindopril treatment (91 +/-3 and 93 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively). Plasma and kidney renin and prorenin were decreased in LL rats. In acute conditions, LL rats exhibited an unspecific hypersensitivity to AII and NE. Chronically given AII exerted a greater pressor effect in LL than in LN rats after 4 weeks (113 +/- 3 v 97 +/- 5 mm Hg in LL and LN rats respectively, P < .05) and, even more, after 8 weeks of infusion (144 +/- 9 v 124 +/- 4 mm Hg in LL and LN rats respectively, P < .05). The NE was devoid of chronic pressor effects. In conclusion, 1) the increased slow pressor response to AII may not be a critical pathogenetic factor in the development of hypertension, as it also exists in normotensive LL rats; 2) LN and LL rats have the same normal BP despite marked differences in their RAS, thus suggesting that there could be several forms of normotension as known for hypertension; and 3) the simple comparison between one genetically hypertensive strain and one single normotensive control strain does not allow one to conclude that a phenotypic difference is of pathophysiological significance.", 
    "543": "Cardiopulmonary reflexes are activated via changes in cardiac filling pressure (volume-sensitive reflex) and chemical stimulation (chemosensitive reflex). The sensitivity of the cardiopulmonary reflexes to these stimuli is impaired in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and other models of hypertension and is thought to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy. The present study investigated whether the sensitivity of the cardiopulmonary reflexes in SHR is restored when cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension are reduced by enalapril treatment. Untreated SHR and WKY rats were fed a normal diet. Another groups of rats were treated with enalapril (10 mg kg-1 day-1, mixed in the diet; SHRE or WKYE) for one month. After treatment, the volume-sensitive reflex was evaluated in each group by determining the decrease in magnitude of the efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) produced by acute isotonic saline volume expansion. Chemoreflex sensitivity was evaluated by examining the bradycardia response elicited by phenyldiguanide administration. Cardiac hypertrophy was determined from the left ventricular/body weight (LV/BW) ratio. Volume expansion produced an attenuated renal sympathoinhibitory response in SHR as compared to WKY rats. As compared to the levels observed in normotensive WKY rats, however, enalapril treatment restored the volume expansion-induced decrease in RSNA in SHRE. SHR with established hypertension had a higher LV/BW ratio (45%) as compared to normotensive WKY rats. With enalapril treatment, the LV/BW ratio was reduced to 19% in SHRE. Finally, the reflex-induced bradycardia response produced by phenyldiguanide was significantly attenuated in SHR compared to WKY rats. Unlike the effects on the volume reflex, the sensitivity of the cardiac chemosensitive reflex to phenyldiguanide was not restored by enalapril treatment in SHRE. Taken together, these results indicate that the impairment of the volume-sensitive, but not the chemosensitive, reflex can be restored by treatment of SHR with enalapril. It is possible that by augmenting the gain of the volume-sensitive reflex control of RSNA, enalapril contributed to the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy and normalization of arterial blood pressure in SHR.", 
    "544": "In this study, we investigated the outcome of lifelong treatment with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) blocker fonsartan (HR 720) in young stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP). In addition to the primary end point, lifespan, and to determine the mechanisms involved in the treatment-induced effects, parameters such as left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac function/metabolism, endothelial function, and the expression/activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were also investigated. Ninety 1-month-old SHR-SP were allotted to 2 groups and treated via drinking water with an antihypertensive dose of fonsartan (10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) or placebo. Fonsartan doubled the lifespan to 30 months in SHR-SP, which was comparable to the lifespan of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. After 15 months, a time when approximately 80% of the placebo group had died, left ventricular hypertrophy was completely prevented in fonsartan-treated animals. Furthermore, cardiac function and metabolism as well as endothelial function were significantly improved. These effects were correlated with increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in the heart and carotid artery and with markedly decreased tissue ACE expression/activities. Lifespan extension and cardiovascular protection by long-term AT(1) blockade with fonsartan led to similar beneficial effects, as observed with long-term ACE inhibition.", 
    "545": "To determine whether each of glycemic control (GC), low protein diet (LPD) or administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) has beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathy through the different mechanisms, changes in charge and size selectivity of glomerulus and renal hemodynamics were analyzed in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients after additive combination therapy (first period: GC only, second period: GC-LPD, third period: GC+LPD+ACEI). To detect improvement of the impairments of glomerular charge selectivity and size selectivity, changes in the ratio of the renal clearance of two plasma proteins with similar molecular radii and different isoelectric points (pIs) (ceruloplasmin and IgG: CRL/IgG) and changes in the ratio of the renal clearance of two plasma proteins with similar pIs and different molecular radii (alpha2-macroglobulin and albumin: alpha2/Alb) were examined before and after each therapy. Creatinine clearance decreased significantly in the first and third periods although slight but not significant decrease was detected in the second period. Filtration fraction was significantly decreased only in the third period. Although renal clearances of Alb, IgG and CRL were decreased in periods of all three therapies, that of alpha2-macroglobulin with a large molecular radius was decreased significantly only after the third therapy. Neither CRL/IgG nor alpha2/Alb changed during these three therapies. These findings suggest that each of three short-term therapies consisting of GC, GC+LPD and GC+LPD+ACEI, reduced proteinuria in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients not through the improvement of renal size and charge selectivities, but through improvement of renal hemodynamics.", 
    "546": "Previous studies indicate that cardiogenic shock (tamponade) in swine produces selective mesenteric ischemia due to disproportionate mesenteric vasospasm mediated primarily by the renin-angiotensin axis. Here, we characterized the systemic and mesenteric hemodynamic responses to hypovolemic shock to better understand the neurohumoral mechanisms controlling this response. Varying degrees of hypovolemic shock were produced by graded levels of hemorrhage, from 12.5 to 50% of the calculated blood volume. Systemic and mesenteric pressures and blood flows were measured, and corresponding vascular resistances were calculated. The hemodynamic responses of the mesenteric vascular bed were compared with those of the systemic (nonmesenteric) vasculature. These experiments were then repeated after confirmed blockade either of the alpha-adrenergic nervous system (phenoxybenzamine), of vasopressin (Manning compound), or of the renin-angiotensin axis (enalapril). Graded levels of hemorrhage produced corresponding graded, reproducible, steady-state levels of systemic hypotension, hypoperfusion, and peripheral vasoconstriction, i.e., hemorrhagic shock. This was associated with disproportionate degrees of mesenteric ischemia due to disproportionate mesenteric vasoconstriction. The selective component of this mesenteric vasoconstrictive response was not attenuated by a-adrenergic blockade nor by vasopressin blockade but was blocked by ablation of the renin-angiotensin axis with enalapril. Like cardiogenic shock, hemorrhagic shock generates selective mesenteric ischemia by producing a disproportionate mesenteric vasospasm that is mediated primarily by the renin-angiotensin axis.", 
    "547": "Progression to irreversible renal parenchymal damage and end-stage renal disease is the final common pathway of chronic proteinuric nephropathies and is relatively independent of the type of initial insult. In animals, a reduction in nephron mass exposes the remaining nephrons to adaptive hemodynamic changes that are intended to sustain renal function but may be detrimental in the long term. High glomerular capillary pressure impairs glomerular permeability to proteins, which are then filtered in excessive quantities and reach the lumen of the proximal tubule. The secondary process of reabsorption of filtered proteins can contribute substantially to renal interstitial injury by activating intracellular events, including upregulation of vasoactive and inflammatory genes. The corresponding molecules formed in excessive amounts by the renal tubules cause an interstitial inflammatory reaction that normally precedes renal scarring and correlates with declining function. In several clinical studies, the increase in urinary protein excretion correlated with the tendency of the renal disease to progress more than it correlated with the underlying renal disease itself. Whenever urinary protein excretion is reduced, the decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slows or stops. Thus, to the extent that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lower the rate of urinary protein excretion, they effectively limit the progressive decline in GFR. If treatment is sufficiently prolonged, the GFR decline can be effectively halted or reversed, even in patients with remarkably severe disease, and remission is now achievable in some patients.", 
    "548": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are standard therapy for congestive cardiac failure. ACE inhibitors have been used worldwide and are usually safe and have relatively few side effects. Hypotension can develop with the first dose of captopril and can lead to symptomatic renal hypoperfusion with subsequent acute renal failure (ARF). The case of a 65-year-old patient with congestive heart failure who developed acute renal failure following the first dose of captopril is described. He required hemodialysis for 8 weeks for the improvement of his renal function and urinary output. The renal biopsy confirmed the presence of acute tubular necrosis. The reversibility of captopril-induced ARF is confirmed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. An immunoallergic mechanism is not thought to have been responsible for this adverse effect. It is advised that caution should be exerted in giving ACE inhibitors to elderly patients with congestive heart failure, particularly if they are on diuretics. Routine biochemical monitoring is suggested before and during captopril therapy.",

    "559": "In genetic models of hypertension, chronically increased sodium diet is associated with aortic hypertrophy and development of extracellular matrix independent of BP. These alterations, often associated with increased stiffness and secretory properties of vascular smooth muscle, are reversed by lowering sodium intake and/or giving diuretics, independently of BP changes. The arterial changes are chronically modulated by hormonal counterregulatory mechanisms since, when sodium intake is high, bradykinin blockade produces more carotid hypertrophy, and when sodium intake is normal, less aortic collagen accumulates because of AT(1)-receptor blockade.",

The antihypertensive effect of diuretics is associated with little change of arterial geometry and stiffness, probably resulting from marked angiotensin-induced increase of arterial stiffness. This latter effect is blocked by converting-enzyme inhibition. All these arterial changes may be genetically modulated since in salt-sensitive hypertensives, increased sodium intake is associated with decreased arterial distensibility, and in some hypertensive subjects, a polymorphism of the AT(1)-receptor gene has been described in association with increased aortic stiffness and is reversed by converting-enzyme inhibition independent of BP.",

    "562": "Infarct scar, a requisite to the rebuilding of necrotic myocardium following myocardial infarction (MI), has long been considered inert. Earlier morphologic studies suggested healing at the infarct site was complete within 6-8 weeks following MI and resultant scar tissue, albeit necessary, was acellular and simply fibrillar collagen. Utilizing molecular and cellular biologic technologies, recent studies indicate otherwise. Infarct scar is composed of phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells, termed myofibroblasts (myoFb) because they express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and these microfilaments confer contractile behavior in response to various peptides and amines. These cells are nourished by a neovasculature and are persistent at the MI site, where they are metabolically active expressing components requisite to angiotensin (Ang) peptide generation, including converting enzyme, receptors for AngII and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. They continue to elaborate fibrillar type I collagen. Their generation of these peptides contribute to ongoing scar tissue collagen turnover and to fibrous tissue formation of noninfarcted myocardium. Infarct scar contraction accounts for its thinning and its tonus may contribute to abnormal ventricular chamber stiffness with diastolic dysfunction. Infarct scar is a dynamic tissue: cellular, vascularized, metabolically active and contractile. Pharmacologic interventions with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist has proven effective in attenuating scar tissue metabolic activity and minimizing adverse accumulation of fibrous tissue in noninfarcted myocardium.", 
    "563": "Diabetic angiopathy is a serious problem in antidiabetic therapy. We wanted to investigate whether treatment with the endothelin(A) receptor antagonist LU 135252 or with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril might prevent angiopathy in long-term type I diabetes mellitus. Six groups of male Wistar rats were investigated: untreated age-matched control rats, healthy controls treated with trandolapril (0.3 mg/kg), healthy controls treated with LU 135252 (100 mg/kg), untreated diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with either trandolapril or LU 135252. Rats were rendered diabetic by injection of streptozotozin. Duration of the disease was 6 months. Thereafter, rats were sacrificed, and hearts, kidneys, and a mesenterial loop were removed. Hearts and kidneys were processed histologically; the mesenterial loop was perfused with saline at constant pressure for investigation of microvessels using microvideoangiometry while treated with either 30 mM KCl, 1 microM acetylcholine, or 1 microM sodium nitroprusside. All diabetic rats developed hyperglycemia without differences among these three groups. Diabetic rats exhibited marked anemia, which was significantly antagonized by both treatments. The heart capillaries/muscle fibers ratio was decreased significantly in diabetic animals, which was prevented fully by both treatments. Renal glomerular diameter was increased in diabetic rats. This was significantly antagonized by LU 135252 but not by trandolapril. Deposition of homogeneous eosinophilic material within the glomeruli was nearly completely prevented by LU 135252. The acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in mesenteric microvessels was significantly attenuated in diabetic rats, which was significantly antagonized by both treatments. We conclude that both angiotensin and endothelin seem to contribute to the development of diabetic angiopathy and that, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, blockade of endothelin(A) receptors may be an interesting new approach to antiangiopathic therapy.",

Laboratory evaluation included serum creatinine of 5.42 mg/dl, plasma renin activity > 20 ng/ml/hr, and antinuclear antibody with a titer of 1 : 1,280. Renal biopsy was performed and the histopathological findings showed that some glomeruli exhibited ischemic retraction with wrinkling of the basement membranes, and that one arteriole exhibited significant intimal hyperplasia with luminal stenosis. These findings were compatible with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). On the 5th day, serum creatinine had risen to 9.16 mg/dl, and he required temporary hemodialysis therapy. After the administration of captopril was started, his blood pressure fell to 160/86 mmHg and serum creatinine was reduced to 5.12 mg/dl. On the 9th day, he exhibited skin eruptions, and captopril was discontinued accordingly and temocapril started. Because of continued eruptions, temocapril was replaced by losartan. His blood pressure was controlled easily and his serum creatinine level reduced steadily. One year after the start of losartan, serum creatinine was 2.25 mg/dl and blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg. SRC is a life-threatening manifestation of systemic sclerosis. In the late 1970s, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was introduced and has dramatically improved the outcome in SRC patients. As ACE inhibitors act mainly on hyperreninemic renal vasoconstrictive hypertension in SRC, we would expect losartan, a selective antagonist of angiotensin receptor subtype 1, to be interchangeable with ACE inhibitors in SRC.

A constellation of cardiovascular risk factors has been described in these individuals, as well as evidence for diffuse endothelial cell dysfunction, which suggests these individuals are particularly susceptible to the development of extensive vascular disease. Recent studies have also suggested that proteinuria is not only a marker for renal disease but it also predicts those patients at greatest risk for the development of chronic and progressive renal insufficiency. This effect of proteinuria was evident in patients in whom urinary protein excretion rates exceeded 1 g/24 hours, but probably is true even in patients with smaller amounts of proteinuria. This effect of proteinuria on progression of renal disease is independent of other risk factors such as level of renal function, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that modification of proteinuria by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors independent of reductions in systemic blood pressure results in slowing of the rate of loss of renal function and even stabilization of renal function over longer periods of treatment. In patients with renal disease, the totality of evidence suggests that multiple pharmacological and dietary modifications will be necessary to achieve the optimal slowing of the progression of renal disease. In addition, strategies will be required to reduce risks involved in the development of cardiovascular disease to ensure optimal patient survival. The similarity of risk factors involved in cardio-renal disease progression should allow us to achieve this goal with our current therapeutic armamentarium.",

Moderately increased plasma creatinine and urea concentrations were found in the Nx group; markedly increased levels in the NxE group. Nx increased proteinuria, and E attenuated its increase. The remnant-kidney weight (Nx 912+/-31 vs. S 1,111+/-36 mg, p<0.001) was still lower, but collagen (Col; Nx 164+/-2 vs. S 148+/-5 mg/100 g, p<0.05) and tubular protein/DNA ratio (Nx 26.2+/-10.8 vs. S 9.8+/-1. 0, p<0.05) increased markedly in the Nx group; E attenuated the kidney growth (NxE 719+/-31 vs. Nx 912+/-31 mg, p<0.01) and decreased the tubular protein/DNA ratio remarkably (NxE 15.3+/-10.5 vs. Nx 26.2 +/-10.8), but E did not inhibit the Col accumulation. Nx decreased the heart (Nx 1,002+/-28 vs. S 1,130+/-41 mg, p<0.05), but not liver weights and did not influence Col concentrations or protein/DNA ratios either in heart or liver. E potentiated the weight decrease of heart (NxE 862+/-20 vs. Nx 1,002+/-28 mg, p<0.01) and liver (NxE 8.3+/-0.44 vs. Nx 10.3+/-0.51 g, p<0.001) and Col accumulation (heart: NxE 113+/-6 vs. Nx 92+/-5 mg/100 g, p<0.01; liver: NxE 134+/-8 vs. Nx 101+/-9 mg/100 g, p<0.01). Nx did not influence either the soleus muscle weight or its Col accumulation, but it increased its protein/DNA ratio (Nx 66.3+/-4.7 vs. S 35.5+/-2. 8 mg/100 g, p<0.01).

In conclusion, kidney ablation nephropathy stimulating kidney proliferation evokes only minor changes in heart, liver and striated muscle. E inhibits markedly the kidney proliferation and functional recovery, but does not prevent the Col accumulation. E evokes antiproliferative changes also in the heart and surprisingly even in the liver. Alterations in soleus muscle are only borderline.", 
    "600": "It has been proposed that vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in regulating vascular growth. Indeed, ACE inhibitors have been reported to prevent neointimal formation after vascular injury in a rat carotid artery model. However, classic pharmacological experiments cannot exclude the potential contributions of hemodynamics and the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In this study, we used antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) to obtain local blockade of vascular ACE expression without effects on systemic hemodynamics and circulating RAS. To increase the effectiveness of antisense action, we modified the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome ODN delivery method by cotransfection with nuclear protein (high mobility group 1 [HMG-1]) and RNase H. In vitro experiments showed the enhanced efficacy of antisense ODN by cotransfection of HMG-1 and RNase H compared with ODN alone. In vivo transfection of antisense ACE ODNs into intact uninjured rat carotid artery resulted in a significant reduction of vascular ACE activity, and cotransfection of HMG-1 and RNase H showed further reduction. We examined the effects of local blockade of vascular ACE expression on neointimal formation after vascular injury. Transfection of antisense ACE ODNs resulted in the attenuation of neointimal formation, whereas sense and scrambled ODNs did not. Blood pressure, heart rate, and serum ACE activity were not affected by antisense treatment. The magnitude of vascular ACE inhibition correlated with the suppression of the neointimal size. Overall, this study demonstrates that local antisense ODN inhibition of vascular ACE expression attenuates neointimal formation independent of hemodynamics and circulating RAS. The results support the existence of a functional tissue angiotensin system in the rat vessel wall.",

In this study we investigated the association of the ACE gene polymorphism and plasma PAI-1 levels in subjects with cerebral infarction. We evaluated the genotype of the ACE gene in 26 subjects with and 28 subjects without a history of ischemic stroke. The ACE genotype was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction. Plasma PAI-1 antigen levels were measured by ELISA. There were no differences in accepted risk factors between the groups with or without cerebral infarction.

In all mouse strains, renin mRNA levels were inversely related to the rate of sodium intake. In eNOS-/- mice renin mRNA levels and renal renin content were 50% lower than in wt mice at each level of salt intake, whilst in nNOS-/- mice renin expression was not different from wt controls. Administration of the general NO-synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) to mice kept on the low-salt/ramipril regimen caused a decrease of renal renin mRNA levels in wt and nNOS-/- mice, but not in eNOS-/- mice.

Epidemiological research suggests a high prevalence of the disease and--since the cut-off for hypertension has been lowered by the Joint National Committee--figures of the problem are, at the moment, probably underestimated. Several studies provided reliable data about the role of ISH as risk factor for mortality, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Large clinical trials show that drug therapy has proved effective in lowering blood pressure and in preventing fatal and non fatal related events.", 
    "605": "The cases of two patients with hyperthyroidism and acute left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with segmental wall motion abnormalities resulting in heart failure are reported. Both had electrocardiographic changes mimicking ischemic coronary artery disease. Treatment with antithyroid medications, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors rapidly restored LV function. The rapid reversibility suggests a role for myocardial stunning, an important entity to recognize in hyperthyroidism since this form of LV dysfunction can be reversed with appropriate treatment.", 
    "606": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common cause of mortality in people with diabetes. The case fatality from MI is high and may be reduced by thrombolysis and treatment with aspirin, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Poor metabolic control is common among diabetic patients with MI, but the importance of controlling blood glucose during and following an MI is debatable. Treatment with statins reduces cardiovascular end-points in diabetic patients with previous MI (secondary prevention). Large studies in diabetic patients without existing heart disease have shown statistically insignificant reductions in heart disease and MI with improved glycaemic control of the diabetes (primary prevention). The treatment of hypertension in people with diabetes prevents cardiovascular end-points, and studies on whether the treatment of hyperlipidaemia reduces heart disease and MI are proceeding.", 
    "607": "Diabetic nephropathy remains a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in western societies, accounting for over one-third of all patients beginning renal replacement therapy. Patients with Type 2 diabetes comprise the largest and fastest-growing single disease group requiring renal support therapy. In addition to the high risk of progression to ESRD, diabetic nephropathy is associated with a very high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which is not abolished by dialysis and renal transplantation. While the prognosis of patients with diabetic nephropathy has considerably improved, a greater focus has recently been placed on treating diabetic patients early in order to prevent future organ failure. Microalbuminuria is an important intermediary end-point that correlates strongly with future advanced renal disease and cardiovascular mortality. Recent evidence indicates that optimum glycaemic control, tight blood pressure control, and the regular screening for and early treatment of microalbuminuria are necessary to prevent the development and progression of diabetic renal disease. By utilizing such strategies, the challenge is to reduce the cumulative incidence of overt nephropathy, with its associated increase in cardiovascular mortality, and the requirement for renal support therapy. Over the next 5-10 years, the patient with Type 2 diabetes will need to be the specific focus of such preventive treatment modalities.", 
    "608": "To enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy against cancer, it is important to deliver anticancer drugs preferentially to cancer cells and to retain the drugs there for a prolonged time. The in vivo prolongation of the exposure time of anticancer drugs in tumors can be accomplished by decreasing tumor tissue blood flow (tBF) after anticancer drug administration. The present study demonstrated that temocapril hydrochloride, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, decreases tumor tBF markedly in LY80 tumor, a subline of Yoshida sarcoma in the rat, without affecting the blood flow in liver, kidney, bone marrow, and brain. In tumor areas with flow of above 20 ml/min/100 g, the tBF decreased by approximately 50% due to temocapril. In tumor areas with tBF of about 20 ml/min/100 g, it became less than 3 ml/min/100 g with temocapril and did not recover during the 2 h experiment. These findings were obtained not only in large tumors, but also in microfoci growing within a transparent chamber. Furthermore, even when temocapril was administered under the condition of increased tumor tBF by administering angiotensin II, tumor tBF decreased immediately. Using this technique, it should be possible to trap anticancer drugs selectively in tumor tissue for an extended period of time.", 
    "609": "This study was designed to determine whether patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors while receiving radiation therapy for lung cancer are protected from developing symptomatic radiation pneumonitis. The records of 213 eligible patients receiving thoracic irradiation for lung cancer with curative intent at Duke University Medical Center from 1994-1997 were reviewed. Of the 213 patients, 26 (12.2%) were on ACE inhibitors (usually for the management of hypertension) during radiotherapy (group 1); the remaining 187 patients (group 2) were not. Patients were irradiated, with fields shaped to protect normal tissues, with total doses of 50-80 Gy. After treatment, patients were generally followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter. Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was scored according to modified National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (i.e., radiographic changes alone were not sufficient for the diagnosis of pneumonitis). There was no difference in the incidence of pneumonitis between the two groups (P = 0.75). Fifteen percent of the patients on ACE inhibitors (group 1) developed symptomatic radiation-induced lung injury compared to 12% of the patients not receiving these drugs (group 2). Although patients in group 1 tended to develop pneumonitis slightly sooner than did patients in group 2, this difference also was not significant (P = 0. 8). Within the dose range prescribed for treating hypertension, ACE inhibitors do not appear to either decrease the incidence or delay the onset of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis among lung cancer patients receiving thoracic irradiation.", 
    "610": "The goal here and in the accompanying paper was to evaluate the two pathways used by the kidney to provide information to the central nervous system (CNS); e.g., the indirect, hormonal route via activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the direct pathway via activation of sympathetic afferents in the caudal thoracic spinal cord. Here, three experiments were designed to evaluate the actions of angiotensin elicited by subcutaneous injection of furosemide on neural activation of the CNS. The number of neurons immunocytochemically staining for the protein product (Fos) of the c-fos gene was used as an index of neuronal activation. In the first experiment, furosemide injection was preceded by treatment with a dose of Captopril, CAP, (an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor) that blocks the peripheral but not the central formation of angiotensin II. In the second experiment, furosemide injection was preceded by treatment with a higher dose of CAP; this dosage blocks the peripheral and central formation of angiotensin II. In the third experiment, furosemide injection was preceded by treatment with Losartan, a competitive receptor antagonist of type I angiotensin II receptors at a dose that would block central and peripheral angiotensin receptors. Control animals in each experiment received injections of vehicle (sterile isotonic saline) instead of furosemide. In each experiment, rats were sacrificed 1.75 h following furosemide or saline injection by transcardial perfusion and tissues were immunocytochemically processed for demonstration of Fos antigen. Rats receiving furosemide plus the low CAP dose showed more Fos-positive cells than control rats in the subfornical organ (SFO), organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT), supraoptic nucleus (SON), magnocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and caudal thoracic/rostral lumbar spinal cord dorsal horn. Rats receiving furosemide plus Losartan or furosemide plus the higher CAP dose did not show increased Fos immunoreactivity in any of the abovementioned structures relative to their respective control animals. We conclude that the receptor-mediated action of angiotensin II is in some way involved in the activation of the pathway that occurs in the SFO, OVLT, SON, and magnocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in response to furosemide treatment. It is possible that the furosemide-induced activation in the SON and PVN is not due to direct actions of angiotensin II on angiotensin receptors in those structures, but instead occurs synaptically as a result of inputs from the SFO and OVLT, which have themselves been activated directly by angiotensin II. In the accompanying paper, furosemide-induced activation in the NTS and caudal thoracic spinal cord is abolished by prior bilateral renal denervation, meaning that these neurons are likely part of a renal afferent pathway. Here, these structures did not elaborate Fos in animals injected with furosemide plus the high CAP dose or furosemide plus Losartan. Thus, the present results also suggest that the central blockade of the formation of angiotensin II or blockade of the actions of angiotensin II prevents in some way the activation of the renal afferent pathway mediated by the renal nerves (the direct pathway) in response to the actions of furosemide. Therefore, these results suggest that central angiotensin II is somehow involved in \"priming\" or increasing the sensitivity of the direct renal afferent pathway. Taken together with the accompanying paper, our results indicate that interruption of the direct pathway via renal denervation did not interfere with the elaboration of Fos in the lamina terminalis; in contrast, modification of the humoral renal afferent pathway can affect the sensitivity of the direct pathway. These results may have important implications for pathophysiological changes associated with fluid balance disorders including renal hypertension.", 
    "611": "The purpose of this study was to examine if there is a relation between the aldosterone escape phenomenon and venous capacitance of the upper and lower limbs in patients with long-term congestive heart failure (CHF) receiving chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The study group consisted of 16 subjects with ischemic CHF in New York Heart Association functional class II (age 59 +/-2 years, ejection fraction 24+/-4%), stabilized under a constant drug regimen comprising furosemide, captopril 50 mg 3 times daily, and digoxin for at least 3 months. Thirteen apparently healthy volunteers, aged 50+/-4 years acted as controls. Forearm and calf venous capacitances were measured simultaneously by venous occlusion plethysmography using mercury-in-silastic strain gauges. The equilibration technique was used to derive venous capacitance from the recorded pressure-volume curves. Active renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels were determined on venous blood samples obtained in the supine position. Angiotensin II (p<0.05) and aldosterone (p<0.01) were statistically significantly higher in patients with CHF under long-term ACE inhibition than in controls (aldosterone escape phenomenon). In CHF, forearm venous capacitance was 2.19+/-0.18 ml/100 ml; calf venous capacitance was 2.83+/-0.27 ml/100 ml. Aldosterone significantly and inversely correlated with venous capacitance in both upper (r = -0.586; p = 0.017) and lower (r = -0.625; p = 0.01) limbs. No correlations were found between forearm or calf venous capacitance and renin or angiotensin II. In patients with heart failure chronically treated with diuretics and full ACE inhibition, venous capacitance is inversely correlated with aldosterone through the mechanism of aldosterone escape, creating the potential for further deterioration of the CHF process.", 
    "612": "We studied acute (day 1) and long-term (day 14) effects of endothelin (ET) receptor blockade with the mixed ET(A/B) antagonist bosentan (1 g twice daily; n = 18) or placebo (n = 12) on plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone in 30 patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digoxin. Hormones were determined before and 3 hours after morning doses of diuretics and digoxin and the double-blind study drug, respectively, on days 1 and 14. On day 1, angiotensin II increased from 16.1+/-17.9 to 27.6+/-5.6 ng/L (p <0.05) with bosentan and similarly with placebo (15.5+/-9.3 and 36.0+/-49.1 ng/L, p = 0.06) after the morning dose of diuretics and digoxin. Aldosterone tended to increase from 322+/-239 to 362+/-254 pmol/L (bosentan) and from 271+/-70 to 297+/-136 pmol/L (placebo). On day 14, before drug intake, angiotensin II was unchanged compared with day 1 in both groups. However, aldosterone was lower than on day 1 with bosentan (213+/-124 vs. 322+/-239 pmol/L, p<0.05) and remained below baseline values 3 hours after drug intake, whereas it was unchanged with placebo. Thus, short-term ET(A/B) receptor antagonism decreases basal aldosterone secretion independently of angiotensin II, suggesting that ET participates in the regulation of aldosterone in patients already treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics.",

The slope of the relationship between GS and BP (percentage of increase in GS/mm Hg increase in BP) in untreated rats (0.7 +/- 0.14) was not significantly altered by either benazepril (0.96 +/- 0.13) or losartan (0.60 +/- 0.08), indicating that RAS blockade, by either agent, resulted in renoprotection that was proportionate to the achieved BP reductions.",

Recent studies have suggested that the degree of reduction in pathological TGF-beta overexpression can be used as a therapeutic index to evaluate the antifibrotic potential of pharmacological angiotensin II (Ang II) blockade in renal disease. Using this target, we found that treatment with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or the Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan reduced TGF-beta overexpression more effectively at doses clearly higher than those required to control blood pressure. However, both forms of Ang II blockade were only partially effective in normalizing TGF-beta expression. This study investigated whether a greater antifibrotic, TGF-beta-reducing benefit can be achieved when Ang II blockade is combined with dietary protein restriction.",

    "621": "The incidence and prevalence of heart failure is on the rise. It has become the single most expensive health care item in the United States and the number one discharge diagnosis in the elderly. The goals of therapy include both prevention and treatment of heart failure. In recent years research studies and randomized clinical trials have revolutionized the understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of this disease. This article focuses on the medical management of chronic systolic heart failure based on the pathophysiology of the disease. Systolic heart failure is characterized by a decrease in left ventricular function and cardiac output, which results in activation of several neurohormonal compensatory systems. The long term effects of this neurohormonal activation leads to further deterioration of cardiac function. The use of hydralazine and nitrates to reduce the systemic vascular resistance was the first to show an improvement in mortality and morbidity. Then angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, by inhibiting the renin angiotensin system, demonstrated a greater improvement in mortality and morbidity. More recently the inhibition of the sympathetic stimulation with beta-blockers has been shown to have an additive effect on morbidity and mortality in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Digoxin and diuretics remain important for improving symptoms and decreasing hospitalizations but have not been shown to decrease mortality. The most recent advance in the treatment of cardiac failure is the demonstration that the aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone decreases morbidity and mortality.", 
    "622": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has a central role in the regulation of the fibrinolytic enzyme system. An elevated plasma PAI-1 level is associated with thrombotic disorders. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the regulation of PAI-1. A 287-bp insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the gene-encoding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is associated with cardiovascular disorders. We evaluated the association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and plasma PAI-1 antigen levels in 110 healthy Japanese male subjects. Subjects with the D-allele of the gene-encoding ACE had higher levels of PAI-1 (26.3 +/- 14.7 ng/ml, mean +/- standard deviation) compared with those without (21.0 +/- 12.0; P = 0.0491). A multiple linear regression model with independent variables (age, body-mass index, total cholesterol level, triglyceride level, ACE I/D genotype, and PAI-1 genotype due to a single guanine I/D polymorphism in the PAI-1 gene) demonstrated that the triglyceride level (P = 0.0059) and ACE I/D genotype (P = 0.0372) were independent predictors of plasma PAI-1 antigen levels in a subset of the subjects without diabetes mellitus that were not taking lipid-lowering drugs. These findings suggest that the ACE I/D polymorphism is a genetic factor for the regulation of plasma PAI-1 antigen levels in the healthy Japanese population.",

Twenty patients with untreated hypertension were classified into two groups: dippers (n = 9) and nondippers (n = 11). Imidapril (10 mg) was given at 07:00 or 18:00 for 4 weeks in a crossover fashion. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored before and after morning and evening treatment every 30 min for 48h by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). In dipper hypertension, the mean 48h BP was reduced with both doses. The decrease in the diurnal BP was stronger when the drug was administered in the evening than morning, but without significant difference. In nondipper hypertension, the systolic BP decreased at night with both doses, but the extent of the nocturnal reduction in systolic BP was greater after morning therapy. There were no significant differences in the decrease in BP during the day or night between the morning and evening administrations. When imidapril was administered in the morning, its serum concentration reached a maximum at 16:00, and when the drug was administered in the evening, it reached a maximum at 6:00. In dipper hypertension, the time taken for the blood concentration of imidapril to reach a maximum changed depending on its time of administration, and the time when the maximum antihypertensive effect of the drug appeared was different. In nondipper hypertension, decreases in the BP were confirmed at night regardless of the time of administration; this might be caused by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors effectively blocking the BP from increasing by activating the parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, when assessing the effectiveness of antihypertensive agents, factors such as the various patterns of BP before therapy and administration time must be considered.",

    "631": "The influence of hypertension on the clinical course and complications of type 2 diabetes is well established. With a special focus on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, this paper will review recently published results of prospective studies addressing two important aspects: the degree of blood pressure control, and the choice of antihypertensive regimen, in the prevention of complications in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. None of the recent studies have shown worse outcomes in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based regimens compared with alternative treatments. Some studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based antihypertensive regimens may be superior to alternative treatments in reducing the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications, whereas other studies found similar effects for beta-blockers or calcium antagonists. Several trials showed beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors over calcium antagonists, and have raised concerns about the use of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists in these patients. However, it remains to be determined whether there should be more reserved use of calcium antagonists in such patients, in the light of more major trials showing the safety and efficacy of calcium antagonists in preventing cardiovascular and renal endpoints. The degree of reduction of blood pressure rather than the choice of a particular drug may be the most important factor. Studies focusing on renal endpoints suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a better antiproteinuric effect than other agents, but this phenomenon is not always reflected by a more beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the decline in glomerular filtration rate. In many ways, the question of whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the best class of agent in these patients is academic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are sufficiently safe, and, according to recent evidence, equally or more effective than other classes of agents. Tight blood pressure control is usually achievable only with a combination of agents. On the basis of available evidence, it appears that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, together with a low-dose cardioselective beta-blocker and a diuretic, should be used in most hypertensive type 2 diabetes patients, with calcium antagonists serving as reserve drugs in case of insufficient blood pressure control.",

The method employed acidification of the serum samples to minimize the hydrolysis of fosinopril to fosinoprilat prior to purification by solid-phase extraction to isolate the two analytes and the two internal standards from human serum. The extracted samples were analyzed by turbo ionspray LC-MS-MS in the positive ion mode. Chromatography was performed on a polymer-based C18 column (Asahipak ODP PVA-C18, 2x50 mm) using gradient elution with methanol and 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.5. The calibration curve, 1.17 to 300 ng/ml, was fitted to a weighted (1/x) linear regression model. Serum quality control (QC) samples used to gauge the accuracy and precision of the method were prepared at concentrations of 5.00, 100, 250 and 500 ng/ml of each analyte. The inter-assay accuracies were within 6% (DEV) for both analytes. The intra- and inter-assay precisions were within 7% and 11% (RSD), respectively, for both analytes.

    "638": "Heart failure is a highly complex, progressive and deadly disease. When incorrectly treated, it results in irreversible structural damage to the myocardium and resists any conventional treatment. This stage has been arbitrarily termed refractory heart failure. However, with timely and sufficiently applied neurohumoral antagonists, progression can be prevented, or at least delayed. In contrast, as soon as heart failure has become moderate or severe due to advanced left ventricular dysfunction, polypharmacy is the rule. Physicians should make every effort to maintain or reconsider optimal neurohumoral antagonist therapy in such patients, even if symptomatic improvement from these agents may be slow. Proper use of diuretics is essential not only for symptom relief but also to achieve full benefit from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Digitalis may be particularly indicated in severe heart failure, irrespective of rhythm. Adjunctive regimens can be helpful in specific patients, but evidence of their salutary effects to prolong life is lacking. In the decompensated state, tailoring intravenous therapy to haemodynamic goals followed by (re-)institution of optimal oral therapy is an option. Only if these strategies fail is heart transplantation justified. While waiting for a donor, patients have been bridged with various intravenous agents, most often inotropes, but symptom relief is associated with risk of increased mortality due to these drugs. New hope emerges from drugs interfering with endothelin and the cytokines, and from research into increasing contractility with calcium sensitising agents. Even though these developments follow established routes, they may enable a more effective approach to prevent worsening heart failure in every single patient.",

A decrease in leptin levels in the celiprolol group was associated with improved insulin sensitivity, while the weight of the moderately obese patients did not change. The clinical significance of a 14% decrease in fasting plasma leptin level remains to be elucidated. The results suggest amelioration of leptin resistance during long-term celiprolol therapy.", 
    "640": "The QUO VADIS (the effects of QUinapril On Vascular Ace and Determinants of ISchemia) study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on angiotensin II formation in human vasculature. Patients (n = 187) scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery used study medication 27 +/- 1 days before surgery. Segments of internal mammary arteries were exposed to increasing doses (0.1 nM-1 microM) of angiotensin I and II in organ baths. The rate of local angiotensin II formation is a function of the reciprocal of the difference between the pEC50's of the dose response curves to angiotensin I and II (-log/mol) and of the area between the curves (units). Quinapril (40 mg) and captopril (3 x 50 mg) similarly and significantly reduced mean blood pressure compared with placebo (p = 0.04). Difference between pEC50's was 0.90 +/- 0.08 in quinapril patients compared with 0.60 +/- 0.08 for placebo (p = 0.01); the area between curves was 91 +/- 8 for quinapril patients compared with 67 +/- 8 for placebo (p = 0.03). Angiotensin II formation was decreased to a lesser extent with captopril and was not statistically different from placebo (p = 0.3); the difference between pEC50's was 0.83 +/- 0.15; the area between curves was 84 +/- 12. This is the first randomized study to demonstrate that long-term oral treatment with an ACE inhibitor reduces vascular angiotensin II formation in humans.", 
    "641": "Unilateral nephrectomy in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) does not produce any change in blood pressure but does induce humoral alterations that might influence the antihypertensive action of some drugs. In this study, the antihypertensive effect of treatment (5 weeks) with placebo (control), verapamil, trandolapril, or their combination (verapamil plus trandolapril) was investigated in SHRs with half renal mass ablation, regarding the structure and function of small mesenteric arteries. Arterial pressure was followed during the period of treatment. Trandolapril and veratran returned pressure to normal, while verapamil was ineffective. Statistically significant differences in the parameters of vessel structure were not observed among groups; thus, the alterations in functionality cannot be attributed to morphologic changes. The noradrenaline-induced contraction was reduced similarly by the three treatments as compared to controls. This difference involved a higher participation of nitric oxide in the trandolapril group, while in the verapamil group the origin of the difference might be due to the abolishment of a cyclooxygenase product. Veratran retained both effects. Acetylcholine-evoked relaxation of vessels precontracted with noradrenaline was improved with treatments versus controls. The abolishment of a contracting prostanoid or an NO scavenger from the cyclooxygenase pathway, due to the treatments implemented, is probably the cause of this.", 
    "642": "The relative efficacy of three antihypertensive drugs in the prevention of further elevation of blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular structural remodeling in 4-week-old genetically hypertensive (GH) rats was studied by means of two complementary methods, stereology and myography. Four to 10-week-old GH rats were treated with valsartan (10 mg/kg/day), enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) or felodipine (30 mg/kg/day). Untreated GH and normotensive control rats of Wistar origin served as controls. Tail-cuff systolic SBP was measured weekly and left ventricular (LV) mass determined at the end of the experiment. Mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) were either fixed by perfusion, embedded in Technovit and sections stained for stereological analysis, or mounted on a wire myograph for structural and functional measurements. BP and LV mass were significantly reduced by all drugs; decreases in BP and LV mass were smaller after felodipine treatment. Valsartan and enalapril caused a decrease in BP to normotensive control values. Felodipine kept BP at the 4-week level and prevented further rise with age. Valsartan caused hypotrophic outward remodeling of MRA, enalapril eutrophic outward remodeling and felodipine hypotrophic remodeling. Myograph measurements showed remodeling of the same order. While all drugs lowered the media/lumen ratio in GH to normal, the outward remodeling after valsartan and enalapril indicates that valsartan and enalapril might be more effective in reversing the inward remodeling of resistance arteries found in essential hypertension.", 
    "643": "Natural products like pumpkin-seed oil (PSO) may modify the potency of the calcium antagonist felodipine (FEL) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor), captopril (CPT) in modulating the biochemical derangement in blood, heart and kidney as well as blood pressure and heart rate of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were investigated. SHR were treated orally with FEL at a dose of 0. 45 mg kg(-1) body wt. or CPT at a dose of 9 mg kg(-1) body wt. once daily for 4 weeks. PSO was administered at a dose of 40 mg kg(-1) body wt. alone or with FEL or CPT in the previous respective dose regimen for the same period to SHR. This study showed that hypertension induced increments the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) by 55% and 38% as well as the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) by 26% and 23% in heart and kidney, respectively, accompanied by reductions in the activity of myocardial superoxide dismutase (SOD) from 3.40+/-0.17 to 2.42+/-0.19 U mg protein(-1)and contents of glutathione (GSH) and protein thiols (PrSHs) in different tissues of SHR as compared to normotensive rats. Treatment of SHR with FEL or CPT monotherapy or combined with PSO produced improvement in the measured free radical scavengers in the heart and kidney. Our results also showed that pretreatment of SHR with PSO for 4 weeks then i.v. administration of FEL or CPT produced a significant beneficial hypotensive action. The results were explained in the light of the antioxidant properties of PSO. Therefore, it is concluded that concomitant administration of FEL or CPT with natural antioxidants can yield a beneficial therapeutic effect and retard the progression of hypertension.", 
    "644": "Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is known to cause renal parenchymal injury with systemic hypertension. To elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism in renal damage induced by NOS inhibition, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was given orally for 12 wk in Wistar rats, and the roles of tissue renin-angiotensin system and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) were investigated. BP and urinary protein excretion increased significantly in L-NAME rats compared with control rats, and glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis developed. In L-NAME rats, the cortical tissue levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and angiotensin II were significantly higher than those in control rats. The cortical mRNA expressions of both TGF-beta1 and fibronectin were significantly elevated in L-NAME rats. Immunohistochemically, increased expressions of both fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin were also revealed in L-NAME rats. In L-NAME rats, these histologic injuries and the increased expression of TGF-beta1 were equally ameliorated by either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, but not by hydralazine. In conclusion, the locally activated renin-angiotensin system in connection with the increased TGF-beta1 expression is a major pathogenetic feature of renal injury in chronically NOS-inhibited rats.", 
    "645": "Management decisions for patients with diabetic eye disease can remain difficult despite the presence of guidelines. The cases below illustrate the dilemmas about the timing of instituting insulin in patients needing laser photocoagulation for improvement of glycaemic control. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for diabetic eye disease is also discussed.", 
    "646": "It has been shown that glomerular ANG II receptors are downregulated and protein kinase C (PKC) activity is enhanced in diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we investigated glomerular and preglomerular vascular ANG II receptors and PKC isoform regulation in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats treated with insulin and/or captopril. Diabetic rats were prepared by injecting STZ (60 mg/kg). Those that developed diabetes after 48 h were treated with low or high doses of insulin, or with a low dose of insulin as well as captopril, and killed 14 days later. Their glomeruli and preglomerular vessels were purified, competitive binding studies were performed by using the ANG II antagonists losartan and PD-123319, and PKC analysis was carried out by Western blotting. Competitive binding studies showed that the AT(1) receptor was the only ANG II receptor detected on both glomeruli and preglomerular vessels of all groups. Preglomerular vascular AT(1) receptor density (B(max)) was significantly upregulated in low insulin-treated STZ rats, whereas glomerular AT(1) B(max) was downregulated. Furthermore, both the captopril- and high insulin-treated groups had less glomerulosclerosis and vascular damage than the low insulin-treated group. PKCalpha, PKCdelta, PKCepsilon, and PKCmu isoforms found in preglomerular vessels were upregulated by captopril and high insulin doses, respectively, whereas no such regulation occurred in glomeruli. We conclude that in STZ-diabetic rats ANG II receptors and PKC isoforms on preglomerular vessels and glomeruli are differentially regulated by treatment with insulin and/or captopril.", 
    "647": "The production of endogenous nitric oxide, which regulates myocardial oxygen consumption, is decreased in heart failure. As with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, amlodipine, a calcium antagonist, increases kinin-mediated nitric oxide production in coronary microvessels. We investigated the possibility of synergy between ACE inhibitors and amlodipine in regulating myocardial oxygen consumption. Left ventricular myocardium was isolated from 6 healthy dog hearts and 5 human hearts with end-stage heart failure at the time of orthotopic heart transplantation. Myocardial oxygen consumption was measured before and after administration of bradykinin, S-nitroso N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP, a nitric oxide donor), ramiprilat (an ACE inhibitor), amlodipine, and the combination of a sub-threshold dose of ramiprilat (10(-8) md/L) + amlodipine. These experiments were repeated with L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis), dichloroisocoumarin (an inhibitor of kinin synthesis), and HOE 140 (a B2 kinin-receptor antagonist). Baseline myocardial oxygen consumption in canine hearts was 182 +/- 21 nmol/g/min. Bradykinin and SNAP caused dose-dependent reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption (p <0.05). Ramiprilat and amlodipine caused a 10 +/- 3.2% and 11 +/- 0.8% reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption, respectively, when used alone (p <0.05). In the presence of a subthreshold dose of ramiprilat, amlodipine caused a larger (15 +/- 1.7%) reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption compared with either drug used alone (p <0.05). In human hearts, baseline myocardial oxygen consumption was 248 +/- 57 nmol/g/min. Amlodipine caused a larger reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption when used with ramiprilat (22 +/- 3.2%) as compared with amlodipine alone (15 +/- 2.6%). The effect of both drugs was attenuated by L-NAME, dichloroisocoumarin, and HOE 140 (p <0.05). In conclusion, ACE inhibitors and amlodipine act synergistically to regulate myocardial oxygen consumption by modulating kinin-mediated nitric oxide release, and this combination of drugs may be useful in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "648": "Because heart failure therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may not be optimal, owing to persistent levels of angiotensin II occurring through incomplete blockade and alternate pathways, the benefit of adding irbesartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, to conventional therapy, including ACE inhibitors, was examined. In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 109 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II and III) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or = 40% received stable doses of ACE inhibitors and diuretics before and throughout the study. Irbesartan was titrated as tolerated to 150 mg once daily in all patients. Exercise tolerance time (ETT), LVEF and clinical status were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Compared with placebo, irbesartan in combination with conventional therapy, including ACE inhibitors, produced favourable trends in ETT and LVEF and was well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.", 
    "649": "The Defibrillators in Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy Treatment Evaluation (DEFINITE) is a multicenter randomized trial. Patients will have nonischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF < or = 35%), a history of symptomatic heart failure and spontaneous arrhythmia (> 10 PVCs/hour or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia defined as 3-15 beats at a rate of > 120 beats/min) on Holter monitor or telemetry within the past 6 months. Patients will be randomized to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) versus no ICD. All patients will receive standard oral medical therapy for heart failure including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers (if tolerated). Patients will be followed for 2-3 years. The primary endpoint will be total mortality. Quality-of-life and pharmacoeconomics analyses will also be performed. A registry will track patients who meet basic inclusion criteria but are not randomized. We estimate an annual total mortality of 15% at 2 years in the treatment arm that does not receive an ICD. The ICD is expected to reduce mortality by 50%. Approximately 204 patients will be required in each treatment group. Twenty-five centers will be included in a trial designed to last an estimated 4 years.", 
    "650": "Plasma adrenomedullin (AM) has been shown to increase in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, little information is available regarding cardiac AM synthesis after MI. Accordingly, we examined the time course of ventricular AM production and potential stimulation of AM in the infarcted and noninfarcted regions in MI rats produced by coronary artery ligation. Compared with sham-operated rats, the ventricular AM peptide level 6 h after MI increased 1.5-fold in the infarcted region and 1.7-fold in the noninfarcted region in association with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (EDP). Northern blot analysis also showed marked induction of AM gene expression in the infarcted region (11-fold) and the noninfarcted region (6-fold) 6 h after MI. The AM peptide level in the infarcted region reached its peak (2. 6-fold) 1 wk postinfarction and thereafter decreased to normal. In the noninfarcted region, however, the AM level remained elevated for at least 4 wk. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that intense immunostaining for AM was limited to myocytes in both the infarcted and noninfarcted regions. Interestingly, the AM level in the noninfarcted region correlated positively with infarct size (r = 0. 40, P < 0.01) and EDP (r = 0.52, P < 0.001). An oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suppressed the overproduction of AM 1 wk postinfarction in association with decreases in EDP and mean arterial pressure. In summary, cardiac AM synthesis was rapidly induced in both the infarcted and noninfarcted regions after MI. The subsequent ventricular AM in the two regions demonstrated different time-concentration curves during 4 wk after MI. AM may be synthesized predominantly by cardiac myocytes, but not by fibroblasts, at least in part, in association with increased ventricular load after MI.", 
    "651": "The kinin peptide system in humans is complex. Whereas plasma kallikrein generates bradykinin peptides, glandular kallikrein generates kallidin peptides. Moreover, a proportion of kinin peptides is hydroxylated on proline(3) of the bradykinin sequence. We established HPLC-based radioimmunoassays for nonhydroxylated and hydroxylated bradykinin and kallidin peptides and their metabolites in blood and urine. Both nonhydroxylated and hydroxylated bradykinin and kallidin peptides were identified in human blood and urine, although the levels in blood were often below the assay detection limit. Whereas kallidin peptides were more abundant than bradykinin peptides in urine, bradykinin peptides were more abundant in blood. Bradykinin and kallidin peptide levels were higher in venous than arterial blood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition increased blood levels of bradykinin, but not kallidin, peptides. Reactive hyperemia had no effect on antecubital venous levels of bradykinin or kallidin peptide levels. These studies demonstrate differential regulation of the bradykinin and kallidin peptide systems, and indicate that blood levels of bradykinin peptides are more responsive to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition than blood levels of kallidin peptides.", 
    "652": "Because bradykinin (BK) appears to have cardioprotective effects ranging from improved hemodynamics to antiproliferative effects, inhibition of BK-degrading enzymes should potentiate such actions. The purpose of this study was to find out which enzymes are responsible for the degradation of BK in human plasma. Human plasma from healthy donors (n = 10) was incubated with BK in the presence or absence of specific enzyme inhibitors. At high (micromolar) concentrations, BK was mostly (>90%) degraded by carboxypeptidase N (CPN)-like activity. In contrast, at low (nanomolar) substrate concentrations, at which the velocity of the catalytic reaction is equivalent to that under physiological conditions, BK was mostly (>90%) converted into an inactive metabolite, BK-(1-7), by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). BK-(1-7) was further converted by ACE into BK-(1-5), with accumulation of this active peptide. A minor fraction (<10%) of the BK was converted into another active metabolite, BK-(1-8), by CPN-like activity. The present study shows that the most critical step in plasma kinin metabolism, i.e., inactivation of BK, is mediated by ACE. Thus inhibition of plasma ACE activity would be cardioprotective by elevating the concentration of BK in the circulation.", 
    "653": "The evidence for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure is substantial. Latest recommendations and guidelines suggest that most heart failure patients should be on a drug regimen of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, diuretic and a beta-blocker.

    "654": "After a myocardial infarction, the physician should evaluate if his patient has a high risk of complications. Main factors for prognosis are left ventricular systolic function, myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias and coronary anatomy. Treatment of symptoms and complications (angina, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias) and drugs aimed at improving prognosis (beta-blockers, platelet inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, estrogen) are discussed. Finally the importance of correcting risk factors is stressed with emphasis on the essential role of statins.", 
    "655": "beta-blocker therapy for dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy is now an accepted and effective treatment.

Twelve patients were treated with both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, 12 patients with only ACE inhibitors, eight patients with only beta-blockers, and 27 patients without beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors. A postoperative echocardiographic study was performed one year after surgery.", 
    "657": "The heart rate was significantly reduced in patients with beta-blockers despite the use of ACE inhibitors after surgery. Postoperative left ventricular volume was more significantly decreased in beta patients than in non-beta patients despite the use of ACE inhibitors.

    "659": "To date, the use of beta-blockers in treating patients with chronic heart failure gains support, this since several large clinical trials reported reduced mortality after chronic beta-blockade. Part of these beneficial effects may result from inhibition of deleterious neurohormone activation that accompanies progression of chronic heart failure. The present study evaluates whether this neurohormone inhibition is preserved after chronic beta-blockade.", 
    "660": "In a retrospective analysis the neurohormonal profiles of patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure were studied from three treatment subgroups: (1) Without beta-blockers or ACE-inhibitors (n=15), (2) without beta-blockers, with ACE-inhibitors (n=324), (3) with beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors (n=31). Patients were on beta-blockers for an average period of 3.8 years. Plasma samples were obtained under controlled conditions.", 
    "661": "Despite uneven group sizes, the groups were well matched for clinical characteristics. Plasma renin levels were significantly lower in patients treated adjunctively with beta-blockers. Plasma aldosterone and endothelin-I levels also tended to be lower after chronic beta-blockade, however, this did not reach statistical significance.", 
    "662": "Chronic adjunctive beta-blocker treatment shows significantly lower plasma renin levels when compared to single ACE-inhibition. This persistent reduction of plasma neurohormone activation may concomitantly reduce the chance of neurohormones to escape from inhibition.", 
    "663": "To investigate further the relationship of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to activation of the B(2) bradykinin (BK) receptor, we transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells to stably express the human receptor and either wild-type ACE (WT-ACE), an ACE construct with most of the cytosolic portion deleted (Cyt-del-ACE), or ACE with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor replacing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains (GPI-ACE). BK or its ACE-resistant analogue were the agonists. All activities (arachidonic acid release and calcium mobilization) were blocked by the B(2) antagonist HOE 140. B(2) was desensitized by repeated administration of BK but resensitized to agonist by ACE inhibitors in the cells expressing both B(2) and either WT-ACE or Cyt-del-ACE. In GPI-ACE expressing cells, the B(2) receptor was still activated by the agonists, but ACE inhibitors did not resensitize. Pretreatment with filipin returned the sensitivity to inhibitors. In immunocytochemistry, GPI-ACE showed patchy, uneven distribution on the plasma membrane that was restored by filipin. Thus, ACE inhibitors were inactive as long as GPI-ACE was sequestered in cholesterol-rich membrane domains. WT-ACE and B(2) receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells co-immunoprecipitated with antibody to receptor, suggesting an interaction on the cell membrane. ACE inhibitors augment BK effects on receptors indirectly only when enzyme and receptor molecules are sterically close, possibly forming a heterodimer.", 
    "664": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure (CHF). In rats, we reported that CHF enhances dipsogenic responses to centrally administered angiotensin I, and central inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) prevents cardiac hypertrophy in CHF. This suggests that the brain RAS is activated in CHF. To clarify the mechanism of the central RAS activation in CHF, we examined brain ACE and the angiotensin receptor (AT) among rats with CHF.", 
    "665": "We created high-output heart failure in 22 male Sprague-Dawley rats by aortocaval shunt. Four weeks after surgery, we examined ACE mRNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and AT by binding autoradiography. ACE mRNA levels were not significantly increased in the subfornical organ (SFO), the hypothalamus, or in the lower brainstem of CHF rats (n = 5) compared with sham-operated rats (SHM) (n = 6). Binding densities for type 1 AT (AT1) in the SFO (P < .05), paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (P < .05), and solitary tract nuclei (P < .05) were higher in rats with CHF (n = 5) than in SHM rats (n = 6). Thus, in rats with CHF, AT1 expression is increased in brain regions that are closely related to water intake, vasopressin release, and hemodynamic regulation.", 
    "666": "The fact that AT1 expression was upregulated in important brain regions related to body fluid control in CHF rats indicates that the brain is a major site of RAS action in CHF rats and, therefore, a possible target site of ACE-inhibitors in the treatment of CHF.",

However, the possible mechanisms of this improvement and the effects of such treatment on regional wall motion have not been established.

    "668": "One hundred nineteen patients from 10 centers were included on this substudy. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with carvedilol or placebo. Echocardiography was performed before randomization and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. LV regional wall motion was assessed using a semiquantitative scoring system. LV wall motion score index (WMSI) was reduced from 2.40 to 2.29 after 6 and 12 months in the carvedilol group and remained unchanged in the placebo group (2-tailed P = .005, carvedilol vs placebo). The percentage of myocardium with normal function also significantly improved with carvedilol treatment.", 
    "669": "Carvedilol improved LV regional WMSI in patients with heart failure caused by ischemic heart disease.

Rates of glucose appearance (Ra) and glucose disappearance (Rd) were isotopically determined during the basal and insulin stimulated periods of the clamp. Twenty-four (5 female) hypertensive (blood pressure >75th centile for age and sex) patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied.

    "674": "We examined the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and age on oxygen radical formation by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. Lung-free cells, including pulmonary alveolar macrophages, were harvested from young (4-month-old) and aged (28-month-old) male guinea pigs using BAL. The oxygen radicals produced by BAL cells were measured by a lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence method using a photon counter. Although spontaneous oxygen radical production by BAL cells from young and aged guinea pigs did not differ, the oxygen radical generation after maximal stimulation with phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA) was greater than that produced without PMA stimulation in both young and aged animals. ACE inhibitors with and without an SH-group (alacepril and lisinopril, respectively) were tested for their effect on oxygen radical formation by BAL cells; both ACE inhibitors inhibited oxygen radical production and generation by BAL cells from both young and aged guinea pigs in a dose-dependent manner. However, the alacepril concentration giving 50% inhibition (IC50) of oxygen radical generation by BAL cells was smaller than the IC50 of lisinopril in both young and aged guinea pigs. These results indicate that ACE inhibitors, in particular those with an SH-group, effectively reduce oxygen radical production by BAL cells from young and aged guinea pigs, and suggest that treatment with ACE inhibitors may be useful for ameliorating oxidant-associated pulmonary disorders in young and aged patients.",

SHR were given deionized drinking water or captopril solution from four to sixteen weeks of age. At twelve weeks of age, rats from each group were instrumented with radiotelemetry devices for continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower in captopril-treated SHR during treatment (92+/-2 vs 147+/-1 mm Hg), and at twelve weeks after treatment withdrawal (131+/-2 vs 158+/-2 mm Hg). In addition, proteinuria, renal vascular resistance, plasma triglyceride levels, fasting glucose levels, post-prandial insulin levels, and heart weights were significantly reduced in the treated SHR compared to control SHR, at time-points between three to seven months after captopril withdrawal. Our findings indicate that short-term administration of an ACE-I during the developmental phase of hypertension in the SHR results in a long-term overall improvement of cardiovascular risk factors.",

(2 microL + 1 microL/h), the administration of capsaicin (0.5 mg, s.c.) increased blood pressure by 14% (P < 0.001) and, while renal perfusion pressure was regulated at an unchanged level, neither renal blood flow (RBF) nor glomerular filtration rate was changed. However, urine flow and absolute and fractional sodium excretion was reduced between 29 and 38% (P<0.05-0.01). All variables had returned to control levels 30 min later. 3. The administration of captopril (40 microg + 20 microg/h i.c.v.) decreased blood pressure and sodium excretion by 6 and 17%, respectively (both P < 0.05). Under these conditions, capsaicin s.c. increased blood pressure by 9% (P<0.05); however, with renal perfusion pressure regulated at a constant level, neither renal haemodynamics nor water nor sodium excretion were changed. 4. A final group of animals received AngII (100 ng + 50 ng/h) concomitantly with captopril i.c.v., which increased blood pressure, RBF and urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretions by 8 (P < 0.05), 22 (P < 0.001 ) and 52-149% (P < 0.05-0.01), respectively. Capsaicin given s.c. under these conditions increased blood pressure by 6% (P < 0.05) and, while renal perfusion pressure was maintained at an unchanged value and renal haemodynamics remained constant, urine flow and absolute and fractional sodium excretion were reduced by 35-38% (all P < 0.05). 5. These data show that for the somatosensory system to induce a reflex increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity sufficient to cause an antinatriuresis and antidiuresis, the presence of AngII is necessary in the brain. How AngII exerts this facilitatory action within the central nervous system remains to be investigated.",

    "685": "We randomized 201 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with either direct angioplasty, thrombolysis, or heparin alone to the ACE inhibitor captopril or the ATII antagonist losartan. The primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and left ventricular parameters. The patients were followed for at least 15 days. The incidence of severe adverse events was similar in both groups, although cough presented less often in the losartan group. Captopril failed to prevent an increase in end-diastolic volume and did not influence left ventricular end-systolic volume. This effect led to an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0. 001) without a change in wall-motion index. Losartan did not affect end-diastolic volume but decreased end-systolic volume (P<0.001), resulting in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.001) and a decrease in wall-motion index (P<0.001).",

In addition, patients received a prophylactic dual chamber pacemaker (PM) in order to protect from bradycardia and for continuous holter monitoring. The devices were programmed in back-up mode with a basal rate of 40 i.p.m. with a hysteresis of 25%. Significantly, more patients were in sinus rhythm after 1 year than at study entry (85% vs. 63%, P<0.01). In 47 patients, under therapy over at least 1 year, the resting heart rate fell from 90+/-19 to 59+/-5 b.p.m. (P<0.001).

From the total cohort, seven patients (6%) developed symptomatic documented bradycardic rhythm disturbances requiring reprogramming of their pacemakers to DDD(R)/VVI(R) mode with higher basic rates. Two of these patients developed AV block, four sinu-atrial blocks or sinus bradycardia and one patient had bradycardic atrial fibrillation. During the observation period five patients died (3 sudden, 1 due to heart failure and 1 due to mesenteric infarction). Two patients had undergone heart transplants. The 1-year survival rate (Kaplan-Meier) without transplantation was 89%.

Approximately 6% of patients under such a regime became pacemaker-dependent in the first year. Compared to historic controls prognosis was better and the need for heart transplantation was lower. The exact role of either agent in combination or alone should be clarified in larger randomized studies.", 
    "690": "Parent beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CyD) and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-CyD (HP-beta-CyD) form 1:1 solid complexes with an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, while hydrophobic perbutanoyl-beta-CyD (TB-beta-CyD) forms a solid dispersion or solid solution with the drug. The binary system of captopril/HP-beta-CyD or captopril/TB-beta-CyD and the ternary system of captopril/TB-beta-CyD/HP-beta-CyD in different molar ratios were prepared by the kneading method, and the release behavior of the drug was investigated. The release rate of captopril from the binary HP-beta-CyD system was rather fast, whereas that from the binary TB-beta-CyD system was comparatively slower, the retarding effect being dependent on the amounts of TB-beta-CyD. The release rate from the ternary captopril/TB-beta-CyD/HP-beta-CyD system was slowed down by the addition of small amounts of HP-beta-CyD, whereas the rate became faster as the molar ratio of HP-beta-CyD further increased (>.25 molar ratio). Both water penetration studies and microscopic observation suggested that the retarding effect is attributable to a gel formation of HP-beta-CyD in the TB-beta-CyD hydrophobic matrix. It was difficult to prolong plasma levels of captopril by administering orally either the binary HP-beta-CyD or TB-beta-CyD system in dogs. On the other hand, the ternary captopril/TB-beta-CyD/HP-beta-CyD system (molar ratio of 1:0.5:0.5) gave a plasma profile comparable to that of a commercially available sustained release preparation (Captoril R). Therefore, a combination of HP-beta-CyD and TB-beta-CyD is useful for the controlled release of water-soluble drugs such as captopril.",

The enzymes were recognized by Y1 polyclonal antibody raised against human renal ACE. The K(M) values were in millimolar order for hippuryl-L-His-Leu (HHL) while for benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-L-His-Leu (ZFHL) they were in 10(-4) M order.

    "692": "Effects of captopril on the formation of leukotrienes (LTs) from stimulated intact human neutrophils were investigated. Neutrophils were stimulated with 1 microM calcium ionophore A23187 for the generation of LTs. A reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography technique and UV spectroscopy were used to detect and quantitate the released LTs namely, LTB4. LTC4. delta6-trans-LTB4 and delta6-trans-12-epi-LTB4. Preincubation of neutrophils with captopril significantly reduced LTB4 formation in a concentration-dependent manner, as compared to diluent-treated control cells. Since LTA4 is the substrate for both LTB4 and LTC4, thus in presence of captopril, shunting of LTA4 from synthesis of LTB4 was not directed to LTC4 formation. This finding was evidenced by the significant decrease of LTC4 production under the influence of high concentration of the drug. Formation of LTB4 stereoisomers, delta6-trans-LTB4 and delta6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 was not markedly altered by captopril. In subsequent experiments, when neutrophils were stimulated with A23187 after preincubation with exogenous arachidonic acid (75 microM), and treatment with captopril, similar findings were obtained for LTB4 and LTC4. Meanwhile, formation of the nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of LTA4 tended to rise reaching significant level in case of delta6-trans-LTB4, at the high concentration of captopril. These results demonstrate that captopril is an inhibitor of enzymatically generated LTs produced by intact human neutrophils, being more potent against LTB4. These effects of captopril on LTs are not mediated via an inhibition of arachidonic acid formation from membrane phospholipids. It could be suggested that captopril, at doses used clinically. could inhibit the generation of LTB4 without affecting LTC4. Consequently, these findings might account for possible antiinflammatory activity for captopril, and further suggest that some of the observed side effects of captopril might not be related to an overproduction of LTC4.",

This study was designed to analyse the spectrum of patients hospitalized in France for heart failure. Patients and Methods A registry involving 120 departments (cardiology, general medicine and geriatrics) and 1058 patients.Results The patients' median age was 76 years, and the male/female ratio was 55/45. Echocardiography was performed in 77% of the cases: the left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in 22%, between 30 and 40% in 25% and greater than 40% in 53%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were prescribed to, respectively, 78% and 63% of patients with ejection fractions above and below 40%. Conclusion In France, patients hospitalized for heart failure tend to be old and are often women; about one in two have relatively preserved left ventricular systolic function. ACE inhibitor prescription seems to be more frequent than currently reported. This survey confirms the clear gap between the populations in clinical trials and those in routine clinical practice.", 
    "701": "Clinical trials have shown the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in delaying the progression of diabetic renal disease. There is less evidence from primary clinical trials of nondiabetic renal disease. We performed an updated meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in slowing the progression of renal disease over a broad range of functional renal impairment. We included published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trials with at least 1 year of follow-up available from January 1970 to June 1999. In nine trials of subjects with diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria, the relative risk for developing macroalbuminuria was 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.53) for individuals treated with an ACE inhibitor compared with placebo. In seven trials of subjects with overt proteinuria and renal insufficiency from a variety of causes (30% diabetes, 70% nondiabetes), the relative risk for doubling of serum creatinine concentration or developing end-stage renal disease was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.73) for individuals treated with an ACE inhibitor compared with placebo. Treatment of individuals with chronic renal insufficiency with ACE inhibitors delays the progression of disease compared with placebo across a spectrum of disease causes and renal dysfunction.",

Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between some genetic polymorphisms and myocardial infarction (MI) or vasospastic angina pectoris in a population from southern France. Genetic polymorphisms of the renin angiotensin system (the D/I polymorphism of the ACE gene and the A1166C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor [AT1R]) and of haemostatic factors (the -675 4G/5G polymorphism of the plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1[PAI-1] gene, and the G to T common point mutation in exon 2, codon 34 of the Factor XIII A-subunit gene) were examined. We assessed the genotype distribution in consecutive coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with MI (n = 201) and vasospastic angina pectoris (n = 43) and in 244 healthy controls comparable in age, sex, body mass index and total cholesterol level. The genotype distribution of AT1R polymorphism was significantly different between controls and patients, the prevalence of the C allele carriers being higher in patients with MI after the age of 45 than in control individuals (61 vs 45%, p <0.01), leading to an odds ratio (OR) of 2 (CI: 1.2-3.4). When looking at the group of patients with vasospastic angina the difference was even higher (76 vs 45%, p <0.01) yielding an OR of 4.3 (CI: 1.4-17.4). Genotype distributions of ACE, PAI-1 and Factor XIII polymorphisms were similar in patients and in controls. This study is in favor of a role of ATIR gene polymorphism in myocardial infarction and vasospastic angina.",

    "707": "There is increasing evidence of important cardiovascular effects of aldosterone via classical mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart. Aldosterone plus excess salt administration has been shown to produce both cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in rats. Various clinical studies have reported that aldosterone plays an important role in cardiac hypertrophy; however, the factors that control plasma aldosterone concentrations during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment have still not been established. In the present study, we examined the relationship between plasma aldosterone concentrations and the degree of ACE inhibition in 25 essential hypertensive patients treated with an ACE inhibitor. Blood pressure decreased with treatment and plasma ACE activity, estimated in vitro (by a colorimetric method) and in vivo (by plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio) assay, was suppressed compared with that of hypertensive patients treated with medication other than ACE inhibitors. No relationship was found between the level of ACE inhibition and plasma aldosterone concentrations, which rose in parallel with the duration of ACE inhibitor treatment. The present study demonstrates that continuous ACE inhibitor therapy produces significant suppression of plasma ACE activity in essential hypertensive patients, but that no relationship exists between plasma aldosterone concentrations and levels of ACE inhibition. Plasma aldosterone concentrations tend to increase with the duration of ACE inhibitor treatment, although this increase did not reflect a reduced inhibition of ACE activity.",

In the case scenarios, less than 30% reported that they would undertake basic investigations, such as chest X-ray or haemoglobin, or prescribe ACE-I. Over 70% perceived diuretics to be a useful diagnostic tool. The most frequent reasons for not prescribing ACE-I were the perceived inconvenience and risks of adverse effects (41%) and the view that most patients can be managed successfully on diuretics alone (27%).

    "713": "Enalapril is a dipeptidic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. It exists as a mixture of two conformers in solution with respect to the peptide bond involving the proline amino group. The RPLC of such products may yield peak splitting or multiple peaks as a result of the slow kinetics of the conformation change. In this study, the influence of the flow-rate, pH, temperature, organic modifier and counter ion on the peak shape and the separation of the cis and trans conformers are examined qualitatively by HPLC. It appears that decrease of relaxation time for isomerization with concomitant improvement in peak shape is favoured by a decrease in pH and flow-rate, increase of temperature, choice of organic solvent (nature, amount) and cationic counter ion concentration in the mobile phase. The elution order of the isomers was dependent on the nature of the organic modifier whereas the separation selectivity was improved by an increase of pH or the addition of a negatively charged counter ion. In addition, an NMR investigation on enalapril is described.", 
    "714": "This study demonstrates that a novel angiotensin I analog, angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)), possesses a high affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is substantially greater than the endogenous substrates. This assessment is based on data derived from a variety of techniques. First, the binding characteristics of (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) were examined. Equilibrium saturation isotherms utilizing guinea pig lung membranes revealed that (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) bound a single high-affinity site in the presence of EDTA exhibiting a K(d) of 0.15 +/- 0.02 nM with a B(max) = 4295 +/- 535 fmol/mg of protein. Competition studies revealed the following rank order of binding affinity: (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) > bradykinin > angiotensin I. Next, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that chemically cross-linked (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) specifically bound a protein of M(r) 173,000 that had the same molecular weight as ACE. Utilizing in vitro autoradiography, the binding distributions of (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) and the ACE inhibitor, (125)I-351A, were also compared. These experiments demonstrated that the binding distributions of (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) and (125)I-351A are identical in the guinea pig lung and testes. Finally, the purification of ACE from guinea pig serum was monitored with (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) and (125)I-351A binding. These results demonstrated that the binding site for (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) and (125)I-351A copurified. These experiments indicate that the novel angiotensin I analog, (125)I-angiotensinogen 3-11(Lys(11)) binds to ACE and suggest that there are critical binding sites outside the catalytic domains of ACE that determine binding specificity and affinity.", 
    "715": "Despite the availability of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), mortality and morbidity remains unacceptably high. CHF is thought to progress as a result of activation of endogenous neurohormonal systems which are activated by the initial myocardial injury. The 2 neurohormonal systems which seem to be important in CHF are the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). While stimulation of the SNS has important circulatory support functions in the short term, long term activation appears to have deleterious effects on cardiac function and outcomes. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the use of beta-blockers in patients with CHF. The published randomised clinical trials of beta-blockers in patients with CHF have shown very promising effects on mortality and morbidity. Several systematic overviews of these trials also suggest beneficial effects on mortality, hospitalisation for CHFE need for transplant, and ejection fraction. The effect of beta-blockers on exercise tolerance. New York Heart Association Function Class (NYHA-FC) and quality of life remain equivocal. The recent presentation of the results from several large-scale trials which were terminated early because of significant survival benefit, has removed any concern over the robustness of the mortality data. Available evidence suggests that a wide variety of patients with CHF, including the elderly, should be considered for beta-blocker therapy. Caution is warranted in the initiation and titration of therapy, as symptoms of CHF may transiently worsen. Whether all beta-blockers are equally efficacious remains unknown.",

New Q waves were associated with a lower ejection fraction (51+/-13% vs 61+/-12%, P<0.0001), a larger end-systolic volume index (37 ml vs 28 ml, P<0.001), and increased cardiac mortality at 30 days (7% vs 2%, P=0.01) and at follow-up (17% vs 7%, P=0.002). On multivariate analysis, age (P<0.01), new Q waves at presentation (P<0.01) and a history of angina (P=0.046) were independent predictors of cardiac mortality, whereas randomization to captopril and the time from symptom onset to streptokinase administration were not.", 
    "718": "New Q waves at presentation are independently associated with a worse outcome after a first myocardial infarction. The presence of new Q waves on the presenting electrocardiogram allows very early identification of patients at risk of increased cardiac mortality.", 
    "719": "This study was performed to assess the effect of treatment with ramipril on the incidence of cardiac events after invasive revascularization in patients with asymptomatic moderate left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "720": "In patients with angina pectoris and left ventricular dysfunction, both invasive revascularization and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce cardiac mortality and morbidity. Whether there is a benefit from combining the two treatment strategies has never been evaluated prospectively.", 
    "721": "After invasive revascularization, 159 patients with preoperative chronic stable angina pectoris, left ventricular ejection fraction between 0.30 and 0.50 and no clinical heart failure were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either ramipril or placebo and subsequently followed for a median of 33 months.", 
    "722": "Ramipril reduced the incidence of the triple-composite end point of cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction or clinical heart failure (risk reduction 58%; 95% confidence interval 7% to 80%, p = 0.031). The incidence of the quadruple-composite end point of cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, clinical heart failure or recurrent angina pectoris was not altered with ramipril. These findings were consistent across subgroups with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction below or above 0.40, and whether coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed.", 
    "723": "In patients with angina pectoris and asymptomatic moderate left ventricular dysfunction, long-term treatment with ramipril after invasive revascularization significantly reduced the incidence of the composite end point of cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction or clinical heart failure, indicating that the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment may be extended to include treatment of this patient group.", 
    "724": "It has been found that the enzyme kininase II present in the seminal plasma inactivates the kinins produced by the kallikreins, thus blocking their beneficial effects on the motility of post-ejaculated mammalian spermatozoa. In this study we examined the influence of 2 kininase II inhibitors (captopril and enalapril maleate) on bradykinin-induced bovine sperm motility. Ejaculates were collected from Holstein-Friesian bulls, and semen samples exhibiting reduced sperm motility (30 to 60%; mean 53 +/- 3.8%) were used. Each semen sample was divided into 6 portions: 1) control; 2) treated with bradykinin (M-8); 3) treated with captopril (M-2); 4) treated with enalapril maleate (M-3); 5) treated with bradykinin + captopril; and 6) treated with bradykinin + enalapril maleate. Total sperm motility was recorded over 4 h at 1-h intervals. It was found that in the second hour after treatment both the combinations of bradykinin + captopril and bradykinin + enalapril maleate considerably enhanced sperm motility compared with that of the controls (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Total sperm motility rates of semen samples treated with these combinations were also higher than in the samples treated either with inhibitors alone or with bradykinin alone. We concluded that the stimulatory effect of bradykinin on bovine sperm motility was considerably potentiated and prolonged by the addition of the kininase II inhibitors.", 
    "725": "Previous in vitro studies showed that the degradation of dynorphin-(1-8) [dyn-(1-8)] by cerebral membrane preparations is almost completely prevented by a mixture of three peptidase inhibitors (PIs), amastatin, captopril and phosphoramidon. In the present investigations, effects of the three PIs on the anti-nociception induced by the intra-third-ventricular (i.t.v.) administration of dyn-(1-8) were examined. The inhibitory effect of dyn-(1-8) on the tail-flick response was increased more than 100-fold by the i.t.v. pretreatment of rats with the three PIs. The inhibition produced by dyn-(1-8) in rats pretreated with any combination of two PIs was significantly smaller than that in rats pretreated with three PIs, indicating that any residual single peptidase could inactivate significant amounts of dyn-(1-8). The antagonistic effectiveness of naloxone, a relatively selective mu-opioid antagonist, indicates that dyn-(1-8)-induced inhibition of tail-flick response in rats pretreated with three PIs is mediated by mu-opioid receptors. Furthermore, mu-receptor-mediated inhibition induced by dyn-(1-8) was significantly greater than that produced by [Met5]-enkephalin in rats pretreated with three PIs. The data obtained in the present investigations together with those obtained in previous studies strongly indicate that dyn-(1-8) not only has well-known kappa-agonist activity but also has high mu-agonist activity.", 
    "726": "Captopril (CpSH), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is reported to provide protection against free-radical mediated damage. The purpose of this study was to investigate, by means of pulse radiolysis technique, the behaviour of CpSH towards radiation-induced radicals in the absence and in the presence of copper(II) ions, which can play a relevant role in the metal catalysed generation of reactive oxygen species. The results indicate that the -SH group is crucial in determining the radical scavenging action of CpSH and the nature of the resulting CpSH transient products in the absence or in the presence of oxygen. In the presence of Cu(II), the -SH group is still involved in the biological action of the molecule participating both in the one-electron reduction of Cu(II) with formation of CpSSCp, and in Cu(I) chelation. This conclusion is supported by the Raman spectroscopic data which allow to identify the CpSH sites involved in the copper complex at different pH. These results suggest that CpSH may potentially inhibit oxidative damage both through free radical scavenging and metal chelation. Considering the low CpSH concentration in vivo, the metal chelation mechanism, more than the direct radical scavenging, could play the major role in moderating the toxicological effects of free radicals.", 
    "727": "We evaluated the effects of chronic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or receptor blockade of angiotensin II type I on the size of myocardial infarcts induced by coronary occlusion-reperfusion in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol or normal diet for 10 weeks. In treated rabbits, myocardial infarction occurred 24 h after the last dose of enalapril or L-158809, an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, because of the drugs' waning effects on hemodynamic parameters. The size of the infarct was significantly larger in cholesterol-fed rabbits than in rabbits fed a normal diet. This augmentation of infarct size in cholesterol-fed rabbits was reversed by long-term treatment with enalapril, but not L-158809. The favorable effects of enalapril treatment disappeared after pretreatment with the bradykinin B(2) receptor blocker HOE 140. Long-term enalapril or L-158809 administration did not reduce the size of the infarct in rabbits fed a normal diet. ACE activity in ischemic myocardium significantly exceeded that in nonischemic myocardium and was further increased in cholesterol-fed rabbits, but was significantly reduced by long-term enalapril, but not L-158809. Moreover, treatment with enalapril, but not L-158809, restored acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings from cholesterol-fed rabbits. These results demonstrate that long-term ACE inhibition, but not angiotensin II type I receptor blockade, effectively reduces the size of myocardial infarcts in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The favorable effects of enalapril treatment may involve primarily a bradykinin B(2) receptor-mediated pathway.", 
    "728": "Vascular hypertrophy occurs during chronic hypertension and contributes to the elevation of peripheral vascular resistance in hypertension. In this study, we examined whether acute pressure overloading of the vascular wall produces activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, enzymes believed to be involved in the pathway for cell proliferation, in isolated perfused rat aortae, and examined whether the mechanical overloading-induced MAP kinase activation is mediated via the vascular angiotensin system. Aortae were perfused with Tyrode solution. Increases in perfusion pressure caused a pressure-dependent increase in MAP kinase activity in endothelium-intact aortae and in endothelium-denuded aortae. The increase in MAP kinase activity induced by pressure loading was inhibited by the angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan, the renin inhibitor, pepstatin A, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Ca(2+) depletion and the Ca(2+) channel antagonist, nifedipine, did not affect the pressure loading-induced MAP kinase activation. The results of the present study suggest that pressure loading of the vascular wall per se can activate MAP kinases in the vasculature and that the MAP kinase activation is mediated at least partly via the vascular angiotensin system. It seems unlikely that the pressure loading-induced increase in MAP kinase activity is mainly mediated via increases in Ca(2+) influx in vascular cells.", 
    "729": "This article reviews the impressive amount of knowledge accumulated in the last few years on the angiotensin II AT2 subtype receptor. Although still elusive, a large body of experimental evidence strongly suggests that it may play an important role in the adaptive changes of the cardiovascular structures in response to pathological conditions such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or hypertension. The most intriguing aspects of the biology of this receptor, however, appear to be: 1) the regulation of its transcription, which plays an important role in the expression of the protein in adults or in injured tissues; 2) its interaction or \"cross-talk\" with the predominant angiotensin II receptor, the AT1 subtype, or with the receptors of other growth factors or cytokines; and 3) its connections with the bradykinin/nitric oxide pathways. These aspects may be relevant for the therapeutical use of drugs which antagonize the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists, as well as for new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "731": "It's a prospective study of 305 patients with heart failure admitted consecutively in a short stay unit.", 
    "732": "The mean age was 73.6 +/- 10.8 years. 50.5% were women and 49.5% men. Women (76.5 +/- 9.7 years) were older than men (70.5 +/- 11.0 years). The etiology was valvular heart disease 30.8%, hypertensive heart disease 26.2%, ischemic heart disease 21.6%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 8.2% and alcoholic cardiomyopathy 5.6%. The more frequent precipitating factors were respiratory infection (37.3%) and arrhythmias (28.7%). No precipitating factor was detected in 13.9%. 46.1% had systolic disfunction (erection fraction < 50%). 96.7% were treated with diuretics, 79.3% with ACE inhibitors and 51.9% with digoxin. 5.3% needed cardiac surgery. Mean length of stay was 5.64 days. In hospital mortality was 5.6%.", 
    "733": "Hypertension is often referred to as the \"silent killer\" because most hypertensive patients are asymptomatic until cardiovascular sequelae such as stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or renal failure occur. LVH is a common finding in patients with hypertension, especially African-Americans. Data from the Framingham Heart Study indicate that LVH is an independent risk factor for major cardiovascular events. In the Amlodipine Cardiovascular Community Trial, 37% of 124 hypertensive patients screened by means of echocardiography had LVH at baseline. Although there was no difference in the prevalence of LVH by gender or age, African-American patients were nearly twice as likely to have LVH than white patients (64% vs. 34%, p<0.05). Hence, aggressive therapy to reach target goals outlined in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) is especially important in this group of patients. Even lifestyle modifications such as weight reduction and limitation of salt intake, if sufficiently aggressive, can lead to regression of LVH, as demonstrated by results of the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS). Most classes of antihypertensive drugs are effective in causing regression of LVH. Vasodilators, such as minoxidil and hydralazine, do not have an effect on regression, possibly because reflex tachycardia and stimulation of catecholamines and the renin-angiotensin system associated with these agents may negate the benefit of reduced afterload. There is some controversy regarding the ability of the angiotensin receptor blockers to reduce LVH. In some studies, these agents were associated with regression, whereas in others they were not. Whether targeting LVH as the primary treatment goal in hypertensive patients will have long-term benefits on outcome above and beyond simply reducing blood pressure is not clear.",
