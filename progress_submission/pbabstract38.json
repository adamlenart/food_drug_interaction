The result is conflicting recommendations and uncertainty among care-providing physicians. Today, the substances from the group of more recent hypertensive agents (calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin 1 receptor blockers) together with the classical agents (diuretics and beta blockers) are recognized as equally justifiable as the five agents of first choice in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. If, however, accompanying diseases are present, the choice of primary medication depends on the respective risk (diabetes, etc.) of the individual patient.

A designated member of staff, often a specialist nurse, must be responsible for identifying patients suitable for management by the protocol and for ensuring that the protocol is adhered to. A new training scheme for \"limited echocardiography\" might enable specialist nurses to investigate left ventricular function within the first 24 hours of admission. Patients should be discharged from hospital as soon as they are out of danger. At present, they are often kept in hospital for process reasons. A \"continuing care\" clinic run by a specialist nurse, where patients can be seen daily after discharge until they are stabilised, is one way of bridging the gap between secondary and primary care.

Both patient groups are part of the same cardiovascular continuum. A mass of evidence has accrued for the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists on both morbidity and mortality across a wide spectrum of patient severity. This evidence has informed the development of management guidelines, although registry data showed that uptake of treatments remained low, leading to research focused on how heart failure care could be delivered more effectively. This has resulted in a range of heart failure management programmes, many of which have been shown to reduce hospital admission rates and to improve adherence with treatments. Multidisciplinary heart failure management programmes that span primary and secondary care are now considered a routine \"standard\" to be aspired to in delivering effective CHF care. Applying such an approach to the care of the post-MI heart failure patient should be equally important.",

The identification of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are important risk factors in this context. The use of secondary prevention treatments in Europe has been evaluated in several surveys. The use of treatments varies across the participating countries and evidence based therapies in general are under-utilised. Various approaches have been taken to disseminate evidence based secondary prevention. Experience from the Italian BRING-UP collaboration illustrates how the use of beta blockers can be increased.

In addition, podocytes from OZR showed positive staining for desmin. Use of the ACE inhibitor quinapril normalized proteinuria, cholesterol levels, glomerular lesions, and podocyte morphology.

    "26": "High salt intake contributes to the risk of hypertension, and this effect is in part mediated by the physiologic action of aldosterone on renal mineralocorticoid receptors. However, the actions of aldosterone are not restricted to the kidneys, because aldosterone can bind to mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart, vasculature, and brain to produce structural and functional changes that lead to target organ damage. Experimental and clinical studies show that, in the setting of high salt intake, blocking aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor reduces progression to target organ damage and preserves vascular function. In many cases, these benefits are independent of changes in blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have short-term effects on reducing aldosterone levels, but frequently aldosterone levels return to pretreatment levels during long-term therapy. Aldosterone blockade may be more completely achieved with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Spironolactone has been shown to have substantial and significant benefits in experimental and clinical studies of cardiac dysfunction. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone blocker with a greater binding affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors than for androgen and progesterone receptors. Eplerenone has similarly demonstrated significant benefits in experimental animals and in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Thus, aldosterone blockade with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists offers target organ protection and may blunt some of the adverse effects of chronic high salt intake.",

    "40": "Cough is an essential protective mechanism for the airways and lungs. Cough receptors are situated in the larynx and tracheobronchial tree, and are mediated by rapidly-adapting (irritant) Adelta fibers, although other receptors such as C-fiber receptors may contribute. Cough plasticity and interactions of cough pathways may occur centrally to enhance the cough reflex. The presence of an increased cough reflex as measured by a tussive response to capsaicin or citric acid in patients with a chronic cough indicate that there is sensitisation of the cough reflex. The most common cause of acute cough is that after a common cold, which usually lasts for less than 2 weeks. Cough that persists longer may be due to asthma and its variant forms (cough variant asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis), rhinosinusitis (postnasal drip), gastro-esophageal reflux, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Chronic persistent cough can contribute to a significant worsening of quality of life measures. Bronchial tumors must be excluded with a chest radiograph. The management of chronic cough includes investigation and treatment of any associated causes, which sometimes leads to control of cough. In a proportion of patients, cough may be idiopathic and remain uncontrolled. Currently-available antitussives such as dextromethorphan or codeine are modestly successful in controlling cough. New antitussives may be developed that act on the sensory receptors or prevent their sensitisation.",

    "49": "Recent studies have suggested that the calcium antagonists have an antiatherogenic antioxidant property. The effects of the calcium antagonists on reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related enzymes, however, remain unknown. We hypothesized that the calcium antagonists inhibit oxidative stress in the hearts of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) through the ROS-scavenging enzymes known as superoxide dismutases (SODs). Male 12-week-old Wister-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHRSP were used for the study. SHRSP were randomized and treated for 6 weeks with a vehicle, amlodipine (5 mg/kg/day), or enalapril (10 mg/kg/day). NAD(P)H oxidase activity was measured by a luminescence assay, and SOD activity was measured spectrophotometrically. Protein expressions were analyzed by immunoblots. Both drugs showed equipotent effects on systolic blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, the wall-to-lumen ratio, the manganese SOD activity, ROS, and the endothelial NO synthase expression in the SHRSP hearts. Furthermore, amlodipine significantly restored copper/zinc-containing SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) expression and its activity in SHRSP hearts to a level equal to that of WKY more effectively than did enalapril (p <0.05), whereas enalapril downregulated NAD(P)H oxidase activity more than did amlodipine (p <0.05) in the SHRSP hearts. Furthermore, amlodipine restored Cu/ZnSOD expression and its activity in SHRSP hearts to a level equal to that in WKY hearts, and this restoration was significantly more effective than that by enalapril (p <0.05); on the other hand, enalapril induced a greater downregulation of NAD(P)H oxidase activity in SHRSP hearts than did amlodipine (p <0.05). Thus, amlodipine may inhibit vascular remodeling and oxidative stress in the SHRSP heart by efficiently upregulating Cu/ZnSOD, suggesting that the calcium antagonist may exhibit an antiatherogenic antioxidative action beyond blood-pressure lowering through the restoration of Cu/ZnSOD activity in the heart in cases of hypertension.", 
    "50": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibit both the formation of angiotensin II and the catabolism of bradykinin (BK). They prevent not only hypertension but also cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. An increase in BK level stimulates the expression of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) and induces prostaglandins, both of which are powerful vasodilator factors. The direct effect of BK against cardiac hypertrophy is still unclear. This study was performed to examine the cardioprotective effects of BK in hypertrophic models. Renovascular hypertensive (RHT) rats were treated with BK (1,000 ng/kg/day), BK+D-arginyl-[Hyp(3), Thi(5), D-Tic(7), Oic(8)]-bradykinin (HOE140) (a BK B(2) receptor antagonist), and BK+N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (a NOS inhibitor) for 3 weeks. Blood pressure was measured and echocardiographic analysis performed during the treatment. Histological data were analyzed to confirm the hypotrophic effect of BK. Treatment with BK improved cardiac remodeling, reducing both the heart weight/body weight ratio and the left ventricular wall thickness. However, co-treatment with HOE140 or L-NAME reversed the anti-hypertrophic action of BK. In particular, cardiac fibrosis or perivascular fibrosis, along with collagen accumulation, were inhibited by treatment with BK, while HOE140 and L-NAME counteracted these changes. In addition, expressions of atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptides (BNP), which are markers of cardiac abnormalities, were down-regulated by treatment with BK. These effects were reversed by co-treatment with HOE140 and L-NAME. Together, these results indicate that BK directly inhibits the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis due to NO release via the BK B(2) receptor. The BK-NO pathway may play an important role in the progression of cardiac remodeling.", 
    "51": "The most known risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the metabolic syndrome. In this study, we characterized changes in liver pathology, hepatic lipid composition, and hepatic iron concentration (HIC) occurring in rats given fructose-enriched diet (FED), with and without therapeutic maneuvers to reduce blood pressure and plasma triglycerides. Rats were given FED or standard rat chow for 5 weeks. Rats on FED were divided into 4 groups: receiving amlodipine (15 mg/kg per day), captopril (90 mg/kg per day), bezafibrate (10 mg/kg per day) in the last 2 weeks, or a control group that received FED only. FED rats had hepatic macrovesicular and microvesicular fat deposits develop, with increase in hepatic triglycerides (+198%) and hepatic cholesterol (+89%), but a decrease in hepatic phospholipids (-36%), hypertriglyceridemia (+223%), and hypertension (+15%), without increase in HIC. Amlodipine reduced blood pressure (-18%), plasma triglycerides (-12%), but there was no change in hepatic triglycerides and phospholipids concentrations. Captopril reduced blood pressure (-24%), plasma triglycerides (-36%), hepatic triglycerides (-51%), and hepatic macrovesicular fat (-51%), but increased HIC (+23%), with a borderline increase in hepatic fibrosis. Bezafibrate reduced plasma triglycerides (-49%), hepatic triglycerides (-78%), hepatic macrovesicular fat (-90%), and blood pressure (-11%). We conclude that FED rats can be a suitable model for human NAFLD. Drugs administered to treat various aspects of the metabolic syndrome could have hepatic effects. An increase in HIC in rats with NAFLD could be associated with increased hepatic fibrosis.",

Decreased heart rate and improvement in lipid parameters were observed in the whole group.", 
    "58": "The risk of cardiovascular (CV) and renal complications begins at a relatively low blood pressure (BP), and this risk is associated with such disorders as metabolic syndrome. When comparing older antihypertensive agents with newer agents, for the most part no significant differences have been seen in rates of CV events. However, rapidly controlling BP is critical to reduce event rates, particularly rates of stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers consistently decrease the rate of onset of type 2 diabetes.", 
    "59": "Diabetes remains the number one cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Only about one third of diabetic patients develop nephropathy, and the risk appears to be, in part, genetically determined. In this article, we review clinical and genetic markers for the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria remains the best available predictor of the subsequent development of nephropathy, even though in recent years it has become clear that less than 50% of individuals with type 1 diabetes progress to overt proteinuria over a period of less than 10 years. It is of great interest for early recognition of risk of nephropathy that small elevations in nighttime blood pressure predict microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes. Genetic markers for diabetic nephropathy have not been conclusively identified. The occurrence of renal events in diabetic patients, however, appears to be influenced by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype, with a dominant deleterious effect of the D allele (D/D or I/D) versus I/I genotype. Some patients with the DD genotype also appear less susceptible to the renoprotective effects of conventional doses of ACE inhibitors, suggesting that ACE genotyping might be useful in selecting those patients that could benefit from higher doses of ACE inhibitors and more aggressive treatment to prevent or delay disease progression.",

The use of these therapies was better than in similar patients in Arkansas (P < .001) and the United States as a whole (P < .01). Calcium-channel blockers were used in 16% of the patients. At a mean follow-up period of 1.5 years, use of beta blockers and aspirin had decreased, whereas the use of statins and ACE inhibitors/ARBs was unchanged.",

Better use of evidence-based therapy may be related to affiliation of this VA Medical Center with a teaching institution where board certified cardiologists are involved in short- and long-term care of these patients.", 
    "64": "The influence of hypertension, and its treatment, on circulating lipid and fibrinogen (Fib) concentrations in patients with essential hypertension was investigated. The lipid profile and Fib levels were measured in 353 patients (131 men) with essential hypertension. Their median age was 60 years (range: 18-85 years). All patients had normal results from liver, renal, and thyroid function tests. There were 162 patients (45.9%) who were not receiving antihypertensive treatment. Of the remaining patients, 117 were taking 'lipid-hostile' beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics) antihypertensives and 74 were taking 'lipid-neutral' (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-II receptor blockers) agents. Patients who were taking 'lipid-hostile' antihypertensive drugs had significantly higher plasma Fib concentrations when compared with those taking 'lipid-neutral' antihypertensives or those not receiving antihypertensive treatment. These differences were not attributable to established factors that influence plasma Fib levels, since when smokers and patients with diabetes mellitus and/or vascular disease were excluded, the difference remained significant. In addition, in these more homogeneous groups, patients receiving 'lipid-neutral' treatment had significantly higher serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with both those taking 'lipid-hostile' antihypertensives and untreated ones. There were no significant differences in the other lipid variables, independently of the presence/absence or the type of antihypertensives. These results suggest that antihypertensive drugs have additional effects, beyond lowering blood pressure, on other vascular risk factors, like Fib and HDL. These effects may depend on the type of drug used.",

According to echocardiography data the use of combination of perindopril with metoprolol and especially carvedilol but not with amiodarone, bisoprolol, or atenolol, was associated with augmented anti-remodeling effect. The use of metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol but not of atenolol was associated with improvement of left ventricular systolic function. Amiodarone, metoprolol, bisoprolol, and atenolol, but not carvedilol diminished beneficial effect of perindopril on left ventricular diastolic function. The use of combination of perindopril with amiodarone or carvedilol was associated with less pronounced remodeling and most rapid and substantial improvement of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.", 
    "66": "A progressive chain of pathophysiological events links cardiovascular risk factors to clinical manifestations of disease and life-threatening cardiovascular events. This chain--the cardiovascular continuum--underlies cardiovascular disease and holds the key to its prevention and treatment. Progressive tissue damage can result in morbidity from congestive heart failure, end-stage heart disease, nephrotic proteinuria and dementia and, eventually, death from cardio- or cerebrovascular causes. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is involved at all stages of the cardiovascular continuum, because the effector molecules of the RAAS, angiotensin II in particular, have direct pathobiological effects on a variety of tissues, including the endothelium, vascular smooth muscle and the renal mesangium. Clinical trials of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have demonstrated the essential validity of this hypothesis. Interruption of the RAAS has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure and post-myocardial infarction, as well as renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Key questions remain, however. What are the clinical effects of combination ARB and ACE inhibitor treatment? How will combinations of RAAS blockade with other agents, such as statins, affect the cardiovascular continuum? Answers to these questions will require well-planned, adequately powered clinical trials, such as the Programme of Research tO evaluate Telmisartan End-organ proteCTION (PROTECTION) and the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) programmes. However, it is already clear that RAAS blockade is an essential part of blocking progression along the cardiovascular continuum.", 
    "67": "Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of mortality world-wide, and the prevalence is expected to increase as a result of projected demographic trends. Aggressive antihypertensive therapy is one intervention that has proven highly effective in reducing the risk of stroke, with relatively small blood pressure reductions affording measurable benefit even in patients not conventionally considered hypertensive. Comparative clinical trials are revealing evidence of differential impacts of antihypertensive classes on the incidence of cerebrovascular disease that will probably be important for therapeutic choice in patients with risk factors for stroke. In particular, the role of the renin-angiotensin system in cerebrovascular disease has come under scrutiny as a result of evidence that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), but perhaps not angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, can reduce the risk of a first stroke to a greater degree than might be expected from their effects on blood pressure alone. Although preclinical evidence suggests that there are differential effects of the type 1 and type 2 receptor activation, the clinical relevance of this is not yet known. Furthermore, the effect on the incidence of stroke conferred by blood pressure control in the early morning hours - the time when the incidence of strokes peaks--has not been tested. Some evidence for the beneficial effect of an ARB on secondary stroke prevention comes from the MOrbidity and mortality after Stroke --Eprosartan compared with nitrendipine in Secondary prevention study (MOSES), which showed that the ARB protected against cerebro- and cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with a previous stroke over and above the protection offered by blood pressure control. These hypotheses are among those being examined in two current large-scale trials: the Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS), and The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) Trial Programme.",

The pathophysiological mechanism underyling this association is still uncertain.

    "91": "Angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated hypertension increases the risk for acute coronary syndrome, a consequence of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which may be caused by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we show that human primary monocytes stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release Ang II, which is an integral component of the signal transduction pathway that leads to MMP-1 production. An Ang II-mediated increase in MMP-1 synthesis occurred only in conjunction with cytokine stimulation. Moreover, Ang II mediated its effect through the Ang II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor, as demonstrated by enhancement of MMP-1 production by an AT(2) agonist, CGP-42112A, and inhibition of MMP-1 production by PD1233319, an AT(2) antagonist. Additionally, exogenous Ang II caused a significant enhancement in MMP-1 production by cytokine-stimulated monocytes, and the most effective enhancement occurrred when Ang II was added 6 h after stimulation. Furthermore, Ang II and the AT(2) agonist increased prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), which in turn mediated the increase in MMP-1, as shown by the inhibition of MMP-1 by indomethacin or aspirin. In contrast, the AT(2) antagonist inhibited the PGE(2) production induced by TNF-alpha and GM-CSF. Ang II, through its interaction with the AT(2) receptor, has a central role in mediating the PGE(2)-dependent production of MMP-1 by monocytes stimulated with TNF-alpha and GM-CSF. These observations provide insight into the association between hypertension and acute coronary syndrome and a possible mechanism by which Ang-converting enzyme inhibitor and aspirin may reduce the risk for heart attacks.",

This review focuses on recent advances in the identification of novel targets, as well as the development of new therapeutic tools for use in the treatment of progressive fibrosing renal diseases. Using our growing knowledge, treatment strategies need to be identified that prevent progression more effectively, as well as inducing regression of developed renal fibrosis.

The role of angiotensin in cognitive function was assessed by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (2 mg/kg), angiotensin 1 receptor (AT(1)) antagonist losartan (5 mg/kg) and their combination. The experimental renal hypertension was induced by the method of Goldblatt. Learning and memory was assessed using the radial arm maze test. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) levels in the pons medulla, hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex were measured as a cholinergic marker of learning and memory. Results indicate that in comparison to normotensive rats, renal hypertensive rats committed significantly higher number of errors and took more trials and days to learn the radial arm maze learning and exhibited memory deficit in the radial arm maze retrieval after two weeks of retention interval, indicating impaired acquisition and memory. Treatment with enalapril, losartan and their combination attenuated the observed memory deficits indicating a possible role of renin angiotensin system in cognitive function. AChE level was reduced in hippocampus and frontal cortex of renal hypertensive rats which could be attributed to the observed memory deficit in hypertensive rats. It can be concluded that, renal hypertensive rats had a poor acquisition, retrieval of the learned behavior, perhaps a possible disturbance in memory consolidation process and that this state was reversed with ACE inhibitor enalapril and AT 1 receptor antagonist losartan.",

Heart failure, both with reduced and preserved systolic function, is a major complication, arising from the frequent associations with coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, and a specific heart muscle dysfunction (cardiomyopathy) that occurs independently of coronary artery disease. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension, together with activation of both the circulating and the tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, contribute to structural fibrosis and autonomic neuropathy. Thus, it becomes imperative to identify cardiac abnormalities early in the course of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes to allow early and aggressive intervention to control glucose and blood pressure and to normalize blood lipid profiles. Patients with diabetes should be treated to secondary prevention targets, including blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL.

    "105": "Chronic pain in the elderly is frequently a result of arthritic disorders, particularly osteoarthritis. The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of serious gastroduodenal adverse reactions but there is evidence that they carry a lower risk for these adverse effects than standard NSAIDs, except when there is concurrent aspirin use. Since gastroduodenal disorders are the most frequently reported serious adverse effects of NSAIDs and these disorders occur more frequently in the elderly, COX-2 inhibitors offer an alternative to standard NSAIDs in this age group. However, they are not appropriate for many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related. Thus, there are good reasons to avoid high doses of COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly. Clinical trials indicate that daily doses of rofecoxib 12.5 mg, celecoxib 100-200 mg, valdecoxib 10mg and etoricoxib 60 mg are the minimum effective doses of these agents. Data from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme indicate that celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are/were the most commonly prescribed doses and that 6% of patients had taken rofecoxib 50 mg/day for longer than recommended. Recent research indicates that COX-2 inhibitors have a thrombotic potential, especially in high doses and when use is prolonged, and this further limits the extent to which they can be used in the elderly. Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated.", 
    "106": "Current interventions with proven efficacy, such as glycemic and blood pressure control, dietary protein restriction, and angiotensin II blockade, slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, whether long-term cessation of CKD progression is possible remains unclear. Because of the pathogenetic complexity of this condition, multidrug interventions with the least adverse effects should be investigated as the next step in attempts to stop CKD progression. Pentoxifylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor with indiscernible toxicity, exerts potent inhibitory effects against cell proliferation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix accumulation, all of which play important roles in CKD progression. Pentoxifylline monotherapy markedly reduces proteinuria in patients with membranous nephropathy. Moreover, limited human studies have proven pentoxifylline efficacy in reducing proteinuria in patients with diabetes receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and in patients with nephrotic syndrome secondary to lupus nephritis despite immunosuppressive therapy. Further clinical trials are necessary to examine whether pentoxifylline can improve renal outcomes in patients receiving interventions of proven efficacy.",

Patients were eligible for registry enrollment if they were hospitalized for heart failure regardless of ejection fraction. There were no exclusions to participation. Patients were followed for 60 days. The IMPACT-HF Registry enrolled 567 patients. The mean age was 71 years, 52% of the patients were men and 82% were Caucasian. At discharge, 71% received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 41% received digoxin, and 62% received beta-blockers.

However, the efficacy of these therapies in patients with coexisting atrial fibrillation has not been adequately assessed. Furthermore, these therapies do not directly address the issue of rhythm management. The use of several antiarrhythmic medications and device therapy is becoming more frequent in the management of this subset of patients. Recent investigations of antiarrhythmic treatment have assessed outcomes such as survival, quality of life, exercise tolerance, and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Data from these studies suggest that antiarrhythmic therapy may be efficacious in such patients. Device therapy is another alternative which has been demonstrated to be at least as beneficial as medical therapy.",

The dose was doubled after 3 weeks in patients who had not responded to treatment (DBP > or =90 mm Hg). The primary efficacy end point was change in DBP from baseline to the end of the study. Secondary outcomes were the responder rate (DBP <90 mm Hg and/or a DBP reduction of > or =10 mm Hg) at the end of the study. Other secondary measures were changes from baseline to the end of the study in heart rate and in the following measures obtained by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime mean DBP and SBP, and the trough:peak ratio. Blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, and creatinine were measured at the end of the placebo run-in period and the end of treatment.

    "130": "To assess how children with hypertension are currently evaluated and managed, we surveyed 438 North American pediatric nephrologists on how they measure blood pressure (BP), BP goals used in pharmacologically treated patients, and antihypertensive drug choices. 190 replies were received (43% response rate), and 185 were analyzable. Oscillometric and aneroid sphygmomanometers were the most commonly used devices for office BP measurement (74.8% of respondents). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used by 63% of respondents. Goal BP in pharmacologically treated patients was set at the 95th percentile by 39% of respondents, and at the 90th percentile by 59%. Only 37% used a different goal BP in children with hypertension and renal disease; of these, 85% used a lower goal and 15% a higher goal. For hypertensive children with diabetes, 47% used a different goal; 99% lower and 1% higher. Whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and calcium-channel blockers (CCB) were chosen by similar proportions of respondents as initial agents for treatment of primary hypertension, most (84%) chose ACEI as their initial agent for hypertension in children with renal disease. Although most pediatric nephrologists treat hypertensive children to a BP goal below the 90th percentile, most do not use lower goals for patients with renal disease or diabetes, in contrast with current recommendations for treatment of adults with these conditions. These findings highlight the need for further studies to determine whether recommendations for treatment of hypertension in adults should be followed in children.", 
    "131": "Significant renal dysfunction is common in patients hospitalized for heart failure and carries a grim prognosis. Patients with heart failure who have or develop renal dysfunction while being treated for heart failure are said to have the cardiorenal syndrome. The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) database, which enrolled nonselected patients admitted to the hospital for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), was used to determine the causes for this renal dysfunction and whether treatment can optimize outcomes. Results show that the average patient admitted for ADHF is older than those typically enrolled in clinical trials and has at least moderate kidney damage, with significantly impaired glomerular filtration rates. Renal dysfunction in patients with heart failure is complex and often multifactorial in origin, but the syndrome may be reversible in some patients. Reduction of angiotensin II levels with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may prevent glomerular hyperfiltration and ultimately preserve renal function; however, patients who are volume-depleted may be especially sensitive to ACE inhibitor-induced efferent arteriolar dilation, so ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with renal dysfunction should be initiated when the patient is volume replete. In conclusion, impaired renal function is common in heart failure patients and may be a key cause of the cascade involving fluid retention, decompensation, and eventual hospital admission. Future pharmacologic research should focus on therapies aimed at maintaining or improving renal function in heart failure patients to reduce the high mortality associated with the cardiorenal syndrome.", 
    "132": "Some evidence suggests that long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may become less effective, thereby increasing angiotensin II levels, which could be inhibited by the addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials with searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Overall, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced ambulatory blood pressure by 4.7/3.0 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9 to 6.5/1.6 to 4.3) compared with ACE inhibitor monotherapy and 3.8/2.9 mm Hg (2.4 to 5.3/0.4 to 5.4) compared with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Clinic blood pressure was reduced by 3.8/2.7 mm Hg (0.9 to 6.7/0.8 to 4.6) and 3.7/2.3 mm Hg (0.4 to 6.9/0.2 to 4.4) compared with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker, respectively. However, the majority of these studies used submaximal doses or once-daily dosing of shorter-acting ACE inhibitors and, when a larger dose of shorter-acting ACE inhibitor was given or a longer-acting ACE inhibitor was used, there was generally no additive effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker on blood pressure. Proteinuria was reduced by the combination compared with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy, an effect that was independent of blood pressure in several studies, suggesting that the combination could have benefits in proteinuric nephropathies. None of the studies was of sufficient size and duration to determine whether there may be safety concerns. In conclusion, although there is a small additive effect on blood pressure with an ACE inhibitor-angiotensin receptor blocker combination, the routine use of this combination in uncomplicated hypertension is not recommended until more carefully controlled studies are performed.",

PSME was found to have a significantly higher trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity which indicated a great capacity for scavenging free radicals. PSME could also prevent pyrogallo red bleaching and DNA damage. After 2 weeks treatment with PSME or Ramipril, survival rates of rats with experimental myocardial infarction were marginally increased (68.2% and 71.4%) compared with saline (61.5%). The ratios of infarct size to left ventricular size in both PSME-and Ramipril-treated rats were significantly less than that in the saline-treated group. Activity of cardiac antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significant higher while level of Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) was lower in the PSME treated group.

    "135": "Ocular vasculopathy resulting from severe systemic hypertension affects retina, choroidea, and the optic nerve. While the pathologic changes of the arterial system, including luminal narrowing, are well documented, little is known about the ocular venous vessels in hypertension. Adult 18-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were untreated (control) or treated with lisinopril for 4 weeks; normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were additional controls. The mean systemic blood pressure (MSP) was monitored chronically using telemetry. The ocular microvasculature was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of corrosion casts, histology of serial sections, and computer-based 3D reconstruction. The MSP in control SHRs (145 +/- 11.9 mmHg) was decreased to 68.1 +/- 4.9 mmHg (P < 0.001) following treatment, which was even below the baseline level of WKY (96.7 +/- 5.8) rats (P < 0.05). In addition to media thickening in arteries, the venous plexus of the choroidea in control SHRs revealed multiple tufts of smooth muscle cells (sphincters) that narrowed the lumen. Correlating to histology, SEM of casts and 3D reconstruction showed numerous constrictions and muscular tufts in veins of the choroidea, narrowing the vascular lumen up to 47%. Following antihypertensive treatment, the percentage of sphincter constriction was decreased to 6% (P < 0.001). The depth of venous sphincter contraction correlated significantly with MSP (r = 0.87). To our knowledge, these results indicate for the first time that venous sphincters occur in the choroidea of the SHRs, and that their muscularity correlates with MSP. Venous sphincters might be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension-related ocular changes.",

We investigated whether targeting the drug to the kidneys may attenuate the inferior response to ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) under high-sodium conditions. The ACE-I, captopril, was coupled to the low molecular weight protein (LMWP) lysozyme, yielding captopril-lysozyme conjugates that accumulate specifically in the proximal tubular cells of the kidneys.

Subsequently, after seven and nine days of treatment, no reduction of proteinuria was observed in the captopril-treated group. In contrast, a significant reduction in proteinuria, amounting to 35+4% (day seven) and 25+2% (day nine), was observed in the captopril-lysozyme conjugate group (p<0.05 compared with the captopril group). In contrast, blood pressure was reduced in the captopril-treated group by 13.9+2.9 mmHg, while in the captopril-lysozyme treated group, an increase of 7.9+3.3 mmHg was found. Renal ACE activity was lowered by 30% in the captopril, as well as in the captopril-lysozyme conjugate treated group, compared with control. Furthermore, the ratio of kidney: plasma levels of captopril almost doubled as a consequence of coupling to lysozyme.", 
    "139": "In proteinuric rats fed with a high-sodium diet, captopril induced a reduction in blood pressure without an effect on proteinuria. In contrast, renal targeting of a five times lower dose of the ACE-I with the captopril-lysozyme conjugate reduced proteinuria without reducing blood pressure. Therefore, renal targeting of ACE-I may be a promising strategy to optimise the therapeutic response of ACE-I.", 
    "140": "Many studies have investigated the process of left ventricular (LV) dilatation and the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction (MI). It has been generally accepted that progression of LV dilatation is a major predictor of heart failure and death after MI. Also, attenuation of LV dilatation is thought to be one of the main mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) produce their beneficial effects. However, evidence for this hypothesis came from studies that were performed before thrombolytic therapy and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were routinely used after acute MI. Nowadays, reperfusion is obtained much more frequently and LV dilatation after MI has become less prevalent. Nevertheless, ACE-Is proved effective in reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality. Therefore, mechanisms other than attenuation of LV dilatation, such as anti-atherosclerotic effects or plaque stabilisation, may explain the long-term beneficial effects of ACE-Is after MI. In the present overview, we evaluate the role of LV dilatation and the effects of ACE-Is after MI in the thrombolytic/primary PCI era and provide recommendations on ACE-I use in clinical practice.",

Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were evaluated at 30 days and 1 year. Out of 5619 patients with angiographically proven coronary stenosis (72% of screened population), 53% presented with stable angina while ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was the indication for coronary angiography in 16% and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina in 30%. Only medical therapy was continued in 21%, whereas mechanical revascularization was performed in the remainder [percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 58% and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 21%]. Patients referred for PCI were younger, were more active, had a lower risk profile, and had less comorbid conditions. CABG was performed mostly in patients with left main lesions (21%), two- (25%), or three-vessel disease (67%) with 4.1 diseased segments, on average. Single-vessel PCI was performed in 82% of patients with either single- (45%), two- (33%), or three-vessel disease (21%). Stents were used in 75% of attempted lesions, with a large variation between sites. Direct PCI for STEMI was performed in 410 cases, representing 7% of the entire workload in the participating catheterization laboratories. Time delay was within 90 min in 76% of direct PCI cases. In keeping with the recommendations of practice guidelines, the survey identified under-use of adjunctive medication (GP IIb/IIIa receptor blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors).

    "152": "High-salt diet is known to result in attenuation of endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aorta. We investigated the possible alterations in electrical responses of rat aortic endothelial cells to acetylcholine as one of the eventual mechanisms that lead to inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by high-salt diet. It was shown that endothelial resting membrane potential in rats fed by high-salt diet did not differ significantly from that observed in the control group (-40.6+/-2.3 mV and -41.2+/-0.9 mV, respectively). The amplitude of acetylcholine-induced hyperpolarization of endothelial cells in rats fed by high-salt diet was significantly attenuated (9.0+/-1.5 mV vs 22.7+/-1.3 mV in the control group). The amplitude of hyperpolarization increased to 25.7+/-1.3 mV when high-salt diet was administered with enalapril, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. We conclude that high-salt diet leads to attenuation of hyperpolarization of rat aortic endothelial cells in response to acetylcholine, that may mediate inhibition of NO synthesis and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril prevents the observed alterations in endothelial electrical responses induced by high-salt diet.",

A severe cough and vocal restrictions with hoarseness were only incompletely cured after changing this anti-hypertensive medication to a adrenergic blocker, combined with a vocal rest and anti-inflammatory inhalation. Therefore we performed a laryngoscopy under general anesthesia and excised the swelling of the vocal cords. Additionally, voice therapy was prescribed and complete restitution achieved. Although hoarseness is documented as a potential side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors, morphological alterations in the vocal cords have not been linked to this type of drug. In our case, prolonged medication with Cibacen 10 led to chronic hyperplastic laryngitis. Initial coughing might have induced the trauma of the epithelium of the vocal cords. Due to the morphological alterations to the vocal cords the patient developed additional functional dysphonia.", 
    "154": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing world-wide, and is now one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease in Western countries. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular events. Therefore, the early identification of patients at greatest risk, and the subsequent initiation of renal and cardiovascular protective treatments, are of the utmost importance. Microalbuminuria refers to a subclinical increase in urinary albumin excretion. By definition it corresponds to an albumin excretion rate of 20 to 200 microg/min (30 to 300 mg/day) or an albumin to creatinine ratio (mg/mmol) of 2.5 to 25 in males and 3.5 to 35 in females. Microalbuminuria is an important clinical finding because it is not only associated with an increased risk of progression to overt proteinuria (macroalbuminuria) and renal failure, but also cardiovascular events. In patients who progress to overt nephropathy, microalbuminuria usually precedes macroalbuminuria by an interval of 5 to 10 years. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, blood pressure increases and renal function declines after the onset of macroalbuminuria. However, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and a decline in renal function may occur when albumin excretion is still in the microalbuminuric range. Large clinical trials have demonstrated that achieving tight glycemic (i.e. glycosylated hemoglobin < 7.0%) and blood pressure (i.e. < 130/85mm Hg) control retards the progression of renal disease. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that the use of antihypertensive agents which target the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can slow the progression of renal disease and provide cardioprotection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria. Antihypertensive agents which target the RAS also appear to have advantages over and above reductions in systemic blood pressure. In summary, the annual screening of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for microalbuminuria, and the initiation of measures to retard the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease, are now considered part of routine clinical practice. In particular, the finding of microalbuminuria should provoke an intensified modification of the common risk factors for renal and cardiovascular disease, that is hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia and smoking. Antihypertensive therapy in patients with microalbuminuria and type 2 diabetes mellitus should be initiated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-II type 1 receptor antagonists.",

Ultrafiltration, gel-filtration, and RP-HPLC were used to separate angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from the hydrolysates. The highest ACE inhibitory activity of enzyme hydrolysates resulted from 4 h incubation with enzymes or their paired combinations. The activities of gel filtrated fractions from these hydrolysates were assayed in vitro, demonstrating that the 3rd peak of enzyme thermolysin+proteinase A hydrolysate had the highest ACE inhibition activity (52.8%). The 3rd peak of this hydrolysate was separated by RP-HPLC into five peaks, of which peak 3 showed 30.1% ACE inhibition activity. Its peptide sequence was determined to be Val-Leu-Ala-Gln-Tyr-Lys. The results suggested that this peptide may be a potent ACE inhibitor which might perhaps be used to develop beef with a bioactive peptide to lower blood pressure.",

Definite role in the treatment of these patients is also played by angiotensin-II receptor blockers. Diastolic left ventricular function is widely spread among patients with chronic heart failure and its important value for prognosis has been demonstrated. However effect of modern drugs used for the treatment of chronic heart failure has been poorly studied. We assessed effects of enalapril, its combination with bisoprolol, carvedilol, and irbesartan on parameters of diastolic function in a randomized prospective controlled study on 84 patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction <40%. It has been shown that left ventricular dysfunction is highly prevalent in patients with chronic heart failure and that differentiated approach to the choice of a drug for the treatment of chronic heart failure requires consideration of the type of diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "157": "Assuming that blood pressure is lowered equivalently, diuretics are more effective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers (alpha-blockers) at preventing heart failure, and they are more effective than ACEIs and alpha-blockers at preventing strokes. Compared with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) and ACEIs, CCBs are less effective at reducing myocardial infarcts and heart failure. There is currently no conceptual framework by which to organize data indicating that some antihypertensive medications are better than others at preventing cardiovascular diseases. The thesis of this article is that the fluid reduction or fluid retention attributable to antihypertensive medications, either alone or in combination, provides a basis for ranking these medications. Diuretics have a theoretical advantage compared with other antihypertensive medications because they reduce total body fluid more than other agents. Therefore, they are the preferred drugs for treating hypertension. The other antihypertensive agents that promote fluid reduction, ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are next in preference, ranking a close second to diuretics. Because beta-blockers have a neutral effect on total body fluid, they rank on a third tier of preference, after ACEIs and ARBs. CCBs and alpha-blockers are the least preferred medications for treating hypertension because they promote fluid retention.",

An exogenous angiotensin converting enzyme after drug inhibition was determined by reacting with hippuryl-histidyl-leucine to produce hippuric acid (HA) which was inversely proportional to the amount of enalaprilat in plasma. The HPLC was carried out on a Lichrosphere 60RP-select B, C18, 5 microm (125 mm x 4.0 mm i.d.) column at flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The analysis time per injection was within 6.5 min.

The effect of valsartan or captopril, or the combination of the two in post-MI HF or systolic dysfunction or both, has been evaluated in the VALIANT (VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion) trial. Total mortality and the combined secondary end point of cardiovascular death, MI or HF were not significantly different in the three groups after 24.7 months of follow-up.

    "175": "The management of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) in children includes immunosuppressive and symptomatic treatment. The response to corticosteroid therapy is the best prognostic marker of the disease. The majority of children with INS (about 85%) are steroid-sensitive as they normalize proteinuria within 4 weeks of daily, oral prednisone administration. The most of steroid-sensitive patients (94%) has minimal change of nephrotic syndrome, while the majority (80.5%-94.4%) of those who are steroid-resistant has focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Initial therapy of INS consists of 60 mg/m2/day prednisone daily for 4 weeks followed by 40 mg/m2 on alternate days for 4 weeks, thereafter decreasing alternate day therapy every month by 25% over the next 4 months. Thus, the overall duration of the initial corticosteroids course is 6 months that may be significantly protective against the future development of frequent relapses. Approximately 30% of patients experience only one attack and are cured after the first course of therapy; 10-20% have only 3 or 4 steroid-responsive episodes before permanent cure; the remaining 40-50% of patients are frequent relapsers, or steroid-dependent. Standard relapse therapy consists of 60 mg/m2/ day prednisone until urine is protein free for at least 3 days, followed by 40 mg/m2 on alternate days for 4 weeks. The treatment of frequent-relapses and steroid-dependent INS includes several different regimens: maintenance (6 months) alternate steroid therapy just above steroid threshold (0.1-0.5 mg/kg/48h), levamisole, alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil) or cyclosporine. The worse prognosis is expected in steroid-resistant patients who are the most difficult to treat. Renal biopsy should be performed in them. At present, there is no consensus on therapeutic regimen for steroid-resistant patients. The following immunosuppressive drugs have been used with varying success: cyclosporine, intravenous methyl prednisone pulses alone or combined with or followed by alkylating agents, plasma-exchange, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Symptomatic treatment includes: 1) dietary regimen with normal protein intake and salt restriction, 2) calcium and vitamin D are prescribed with steroids, 3) diuretics should be used in case of severe edema, 4) infusion of albumin in case of severe hypovolemia, 5) treatment of hypertension, 6) anticoagulant therapy, and 7) prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk patients.",

The majority of patients with symptomatic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) have significant mitral stenosis (MS) and are denied ACEI therapy, because of the fear of hypotension in the presence of fixed obstruction. The authors assessed the safety and efficacy of ACEI in 109 consecutive patients with RHD and with significant mitral stenosis (mitral valve orifice, MVO < 1.5 cm2)and with NYHA class III or IV heart failure symptoms. Mean age was 33.1+/-12 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) was 111+/-10, and diastolic BP was 73+/-8 mm Hg. MS was significant in 100 patients with mitral regurgitation in 46, aortic regurgitation in 19, and pulmonary hypertension in 60 patients. After initial stabilization, enalapril 2.5 mg bid was started in hospital and titrated up to 10 mg bid over 2 weeks. NYHA status, Borg score, and 6-minute walk test were assessed at baseline, and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Seventy-nine of the 100 patients who completed the study had severe MS (MVO < 1.0 cm2). Enalapril was well tolerated by all study patients without hypotension or worsening of symptoms.

Patients with associated regurgitant lesions showed more improvement in exercise capacity (120+/-93 vs 39+/-56 m, p < 0.001). Enalapril was well tolerated in patients with RHD with moderate and severe MS. Irrespective of the valve pathology, enalapril improved functional status and exercise capacity with maximum benefit in patients with concomitant regurgitant valvular heart disease.", 
    "181": "The basis for accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes is unclear. Diabetes is associated with loss of heparan sulfate (HS) from the liver, which may impede lipoprotein clearance and thereby worsen atherosclerosis. To study hepatic HS loss in diabetes, we examined regulation of HS N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (NDST), a key enzyme in hepatic HS biosynthesis. Hepatic NDST mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity were suppressed by >50% 2 weeks after induction of type 1 diabetes in rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, had no effect on hyperglycemia or hepatic NDST mRNA levels, yet increased hepatic NDST protein and enzymatic activity. Similar results were obtained in diabetic animals treated with losartan, which blocks the type 1 receptor for angiotensin II (AngII). Consistent with these findings, diabetic livers exhibited increased ACE expression, and addition of AngII to cultured hepatoma cells reduced NDST activity and protein. We conclude that diabetes substantially suppresses hepatic NDST mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity. AngII contributes to suppression of NDST protein and enzymatic activity, whereas mRNA suppression occurs independently. Suppression of hepatic NDST may contribute to diabetic dyslipidemia, and stimulation of NDST activity by AngII inhibitors may provide cardiovascular protection.", 
    "182": "Changes in left ventricular dimensions and performance were studied in 43 patients after transcatheter occlusion or surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus. The patients were assigned to 2 groups based on their ductal diameter: >/= 3.1 mm to group A (n = 27) and </= 3 mm to group B (n = 16). The mean age and weight of the groups were comparable. Before intervention, group A had a significantly larger mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter than group B, while all patients had normal shortening fraction and ejection fraction. Within 1 month after intervention, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter showed a trend towards regression while shortening fraction and ejection fraction decreased significantly in group A. There were no significant changes in these parameters in group B. Between 1 and 6 months after intervention, left ventricular performance improved in most of the group A patients who were followed up. We conclude that closure of large ductus arteriosus in children leads to significant immediate deterioration of left ventricular performance, which appears to recover within a few months. Echocardiographic study before hospital discharge is recommended in these patients. Serious deterioration of ventricular performance after closure may warrant the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "183": "Impaired endothelial function is recognised as one of the earliest events of atherogenesis. Endothelium-dependent vasomotion has been the principal method to assess endothelial function. In this article, we will discuss the clinical value of the different techniques to evaluate endothelium-dependent vasomotion. To date, there seems not to be a simple and reliably endothelial function test to identify asymptomatic subjects at increased risk for cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Recent studies indicate that pharmacological interventions, in particular with ACE-inhibitors and statins, might improve endothelial function. However, there is no solid evidence that improvement of endothelial function is a necessity for the observed reduction in cardiovascular events by these compounds. Overall, at this moment, there is no place in clinical practice for the use of endothelial function as a method for risk assessment or target of pharmacological interventions.",

    "185": "The expression, localisation and function of enzymes responsible for the local formation of angiotensin II in atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic human coronary arteries were studied. Human epicardial coronary arteries expressed mRNA for both ACE and chymase. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that ACE was localised to the vascular endothelium, and to a lesser extent the medial smooth muscle cells, in both large and small arteries. Chymase was detected in both types of vessel but was shown to be associated with mast cells. The contractions to angiotensin I in large arteries were inhibited only by a combination of quinaprilat and soyabean trypsin inhibitor. In the intramyocardial arteries the response to angiotensin I was markedly inhibited in the presence of chymostatin. These findings demonstrate that a dual pathway for the synthesis of angiotensin II is active in diseased and non-diseased coronary arteries.",

There were significant decreases in heart weight/body weight ratios, large and small vessel morphology, and interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in CAP-treated animals and their offspring in comparison to untreated SHR.", 
    "189": "The CV protective properties of early, short-term CAP treatment were not solely due to a reduction in MAP. Although MAP was higher in OCAP and 2nd G, CV structure resembled that found in WKY and SCAP. The effects of our early treatment appear to be due to chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and its effects on growth of CV tissues and the development of fibrosis.", 
    "190": "The serum concentration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) depends on the individual genotype. Thus, ACE levels might be higher (DD-genotype), intermediate (ID) or low (II). Pre-therapeutic determination of the genotype might therefore optimize therapy with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers. However, although numerous interventional studies have been performed they are hampered by a low number of included patients and have often yielded differing results. Thus, in order to overcome current controversies larger multicenter studies are warranted before recommending a general testing for genotype prior to initiation of therapy which interferes with the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "191": "The objective of the present study was to assess the cardioprotective effect of dual NEP-ACE inhibition in relation to endogenous cardiac bradykinin (BK), its active metabolite des-Arg9-BK, endogenous brain natriuretic peptides (BNP), and cGMP. Rats were treated with the dual metallopeptidase inhibitor, omapatrilat, or the ACE inhibitor, ramipril, for 7 d (1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)). Hearts were then isolated and subjected to a zero-flow ischemia and reperfusion (except controls), in the absence or presence of either a B2-receptor antagonist (Hoe-140), a B1-receptor antagonist (Lys-Leu8-des-Arg9-BK), or the GC-A/GC-B-receptor antagonist (HS-142-1). Chronic omapatrilat and ramipril increased the amount of endogenous BK collected upon reperfusion, but only ramipril increased that of des-Arg9-BK. Only omapatrilat increased both peak BNP and peak cGMP upon reperfusion, those increases being blocked by Hoe-140. Chronic omapatrilat (but not ramipril) decreased the total noradrenaline and lactate dehydrogenase release during the reperfusion period. Importantly, only omapatrilat improved the functional recovery of the ischemic reperfused heart, with a reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and improved developed left ventricular pressure. All cardio protective effects of omapatrilat were blocked by Hoe-140 and by HS-142-1, but not by the B1-receptor antagonist. In conclusion, a chronic treatment with a dual metallopeptidase inhibitor demonstrated a cardioprotective action not observed with an ACE inhibitor in a context of severe ischemia in rat isolated hearts, which was mediated by both endogenous BK and BNP.", 
    "192": "Heart failure affects more: 350,000 Canadians and accounts for more than dollar 1 billion of Canada's health budget. It is the most common condition requiring re-hospitalization and carries with it a mortality rate of between 25% and 40% (Liu et al., 2003) In British Columbia, approximately 70,000 people (1.5% of the B.C. population) were diagnosed with heart failure in 2003 and it is estimated that a further 70,000 people may be living undiagnosed with the condition (British Columbia Ministry of Health Services, 2003). The vast majority of people with heart failure are over 70 years of age. As our population ages, it is reasonable to expect that the burden of heart failure on our health system will continue to increase. Heart failure is usually a chronic condition marked by frequent exacerbations. It is these exacerbations that bring patients to hospital emergency departments and medical wards.", 
    "193": "We studied patients with valvular heart disease to investigate whether chronic preoperative treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors modulates the effect of phenylephrine (PE) on anaesthesia-induced hypotension. Sixty-five patients were enrolled in the study and hypotension developed after anaesthesia in 36 (18 in the control group and 18 in the ACE inhibitor group). These patients received PE infusions, which were increased in a stepwise fashion at 10-min intervals. Increased mean arterial pressure due to PE infusion was significant only in the control group. There was no significant difference in pressor response or change in haemodynamic variables with PE infusion between the two groups. Treatment with ACE inhibitors did not increase the incidence of hypotensive episodes or significantly modify pressor response after anaesthesia in patients with valvular heart disease.",

    "195": "This was a prospective randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial. Client-owned dogs (n = 43) with mild to moderate HF caused by MMVD were randomly assigned to one of two groups, which received either pimobendan (P dogs) or ramipril (R dogs) for six months. The outcome measures studied were: adverse HF outcome, defined as failure to complete the trial as a direct consequence of HF; maximum furosemide dose (mg/kg/day) administered during the study period; and any requirement for additional visits to the clinic as a direct consequence of HF.", 
    "196": "Treatment with pimobendan was well tolerated compared with treatment with ramipril. P dogs were 25 per cent as likely as R dogs to have an adverse HF outcome (odds ratio 4.09, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.03 to 16.3, P = 0.046).", 
    "197": "R dogs had a higher overall score and thus may have had more advanced disease than P dogs at baseline (P = 0.04). These results should be interpreted cautiously but such a high odds ratio warrants further investigation.", 
    "198": "The metabolic syndrome is a term used to indicate the presence of a cluster of conditions associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and early mortality. A fairly common condition in the elderly, it is caused primarily by physical inactivity and excessive calorie intake and characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose, dyslipidemia, and prehypertension. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that a lifestyle of moderate-intensity, physical activity for 30 minutes a day, most days of the week, combined with weight loss of 5-7%, can reverse individual components of the metabolic syndrome. When lifestyle modifications are insufficient, a multidrug regimen may be necessary to treat different components of the metabolic syndrome. This paper reviews current literature on the metabolic syndrome, including its causes, incidence and approaches for successful treatment.",

In the assessment of the quality indicators we excluded patients who were not eligible for the procedure. Among cohorts of 'ideal candidates' for specific interventions, 64% in hospital A and 73% in hospital C had reperfusion within 12 hours either with thrombolytics or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (P = 0.367). Further, in hospitals A, B, and C, respectively 97, 94, and 84% were prescribed aspirin during the initial hospitalization (P = 0.0002), and respectively 68, 91, and 75% received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at discharge in the case of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (P = 0.003).",

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is one of the most important characteristics of hypertension target organ damage and is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Therefore, effective regression of LVH is a main aim of hypertension treatment and also an important public health concern. However, few studies of the regression of LVH have been reported. In particular, little is known about the relationship between the genotypes of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase (CMA) genes, and the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs in regression of LVH.",

The mean reduction in LVMI was 41.50+/-28.48 g m-2. Reduction of LVM, LVMI and percentage reduction of LVMI were more in the DD group than in the II and ID groups (P<0.05). No significant difference in other indices was found in the different genotype groups of ACE (P>0.05).

These had remarkable antioxidant activity similar or superior to that of 1 mM alpha-tocopherol. They also had high scavenging activities against active oxygen species as the superoxide anion radical and hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, they showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activities and the activities were similar to those from various fermented foods such as fish sauce, sake, vinegar, cheese, miso, and natto. The present studies reveal that enzymatic hydrolysates from bee bread are of benefit not only for the materials of health food diets, but also for in patients undergoing various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension.",

The hazard ratio for the primary outcome associated with this initial hypokalemia was 1.44 (1.00-2.06) on multivariate analysis. The combined primary outcome (myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, stroke) was not different throughout deciles of serum potassium but the lowest and highest deciles included many with normokalemia. Randomized treatment was withheld because of hyperkalemia in 8 and 6 people allocated to ramipril and placebo, respectively. The benefit of ramipril on cardiovascular outcomes was independent of serum potassium, but ramipril reduced hypokalemia in the entire cohort (1.15 vs 1.86% with placebo, p = 0.005), particularly in those participants on diuretics (3.8% vs 6.5%, p = 0.07).",

In renal allograft recipients, however, specific effects of angiotensin antagonism on glomerular function have not been evaluated so far.", 
    "217": "Twenty patients with favorable allograft function were included into a prospective study within the first year after renal transplantation. Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, albuminuria, and the fractional clearances of neutral dextrans were determined at baseline and after 3 months of treatment with candesartan. Ten individuals after renal donation served as controls for the baseline evaluation.", 
    "218": "Compared with the control group, the allograft recipients had a higher renal-vascular resistance and a lower glomerular filtration rate. Albuminuria was significantly higher; however, the difference in the dextran sieving curve was not statistically significant. Apart from mild changes in biochemical parameters, the therapy with candesartan led to a rise in serum creatinine along with a nonsignificant drop in the glomerular filtration rate. There was a highly significant drop in filtration fraction and albuminuria. Glomerular permselectivity clearly improved for a range of dextran molecular diameters from 43 Angstrom up to 73 Angstrom.", 
    "219": "A therapy with candesartan has distinct effects on glomerular function in patients after renal transplantation. A drop in filtration fraction along with an improvement in glomerular permselectivity and albuminuria point to a nephroprotective quality that should lead to a systematic clinical evaluation of candesartan even in patients with favorable renal allograft function.",

Although transient in some cases, the majority of these patients continue to carry a substantially higher mortality risk. New data on the benefits of eplerenone and carvedilol from large clinical trials have added to the complexity of polypharmacy in this patient subgroup, although aggressive medical strategies to prevent or reverse infarct-related left ventricular remodeling remains the most effective method to save lives and prevent disabilities.",

This benefit exists both in normotensive and hypertensive individuals and is present in those with various grades of cardiovascular risk. This beneficial cardiovascular effect has now been observed with several angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, suggesting a class effect. The Prevention of Events with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibition trial studied the effect of adding the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril to a contemporary therapeutic regimen of patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function. In this study, the addition of trandolapril did not confer any additional benefit in terms of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. The neutral findings in this trial add a new wrinkle to the concept of class effect for cardiovascular protection with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease.",

The dog also had a history of several episodes of syncope prior to presentation. A comprehensive diagnostic investigation revealed a midsystolic click sound on cardiac auscultation, signs of left sided cardiac enlargement in ECG and thoracic radiography, mitral valvular leaflet protrusion into left the atrium, decreased E-point-to septal separation (EPSS) and mitral regurgitated flow in echocardiography, all of which are characteristic signs of mitral valvular prolapse. After intensive care with diuretics [corrected] and a vasodilator with oxygen supplement, the condition of the dog was stabilized.

Patients were consecutively hospitalized and admitted for various acute conditions. Following discharge all-cause mortality was recorded. Prevalence and association of various variables with mortality were statistically analyzed. Prevailing in the diabetics versus nondiabetics were younger age (p < 0.05), pulmonary edema on admission (p = 0.002), using furosemide > 80 mg/day (p < 0.01) for > 1 year (p < 0.01) and hyponatremia (p = 0.01). Less prevalent were chronic lung disease (p < 0.01) and cardiac arrhythmias (p = 0.001). On follow-up extending up to 60 months, diabetic patients, especially those with fasting blood glucose levels on admission > or = 180 mg/dl, survived for a shorter period of time than nondiabetics (p = 0.02). Associated with increased mortality in the diabetic group were female gender (p = 0.04), furosemide > or = 80 mg/day (p < 0.001) and renal dysfunction (RD; p = 0.04). The respective variables in the nondiabetics were advanced age (p < 0.001) and RD (p = 0.002). Although they were younger, diabetic patients presented more severe CHF. It is recommended that special attention should be given to diabetic females, those using higher furosemide dosages and those suffering from RD.", 
    "224": "The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of a calcium channel blocker, azelnidipine (1 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocapril (10 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan (5 mg/kg/day), and their combination on Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS rats) developing heart failure with preserved systolic function. DS rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age and progressively developed hypertension. Although monotherapy with azelnidipine lowered the blood pressure of DS rats to a greater extent than monotherapy with temocapril or olmesartan, the three drugs had similar effects on cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, the expressions of brain natriuretic peptide, transforming growth factor-beta1, collagen I, collagen III and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA (as estimated by Northern blot analysis), and cardiac diastolic dysfunction (as estimated by echocardiography). These results show that ACE and AT1 receptor, as well as hypertension, are involved in the development of heart failure with preserved systolic function in DS rats. The combination of azelnidipine with olmesartan or temocapril produced no additive hypotensive effect in DS rats and no additive effect on cardiac hypertrophy or gene expressions. However, the combination therapy prolonged the survival rate of DS rats more than azelnidipine (p <0.01) or temocapril alone (p <0.05), and this additive beneficial effect by the combination therapy was associated with a greater reduction of cardiac fibrosis, urinary albumin excretion and serum creatinine. Our results thus showed that the combination of a calcium channel blocker with an ARB or an ACE inhibitor had additive preventive effects on a rat model of hypertensive heart failure with preserved systolic function. Thus, combination therapy with these agents seems to be a useful therapeutic strategy for the prevention of hypertensive heart failure.",

The authors determined risks for vasospasm, symptomatic vasospasm, and poor clinical outcomes in patients with documented pre-hemorrhagic use of calcium channel blockers, beta-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), non-SSRI vasoactive antidepressants, or statins.",

On univariate analysis, the risk for all vasospasm tended to increase in patients taking SSRIs (p = 0.09) and statins (p = 0.05); SSRI use increased the risk for symptomatic vasospasm (p = 0.028). The Cochran-Armitage trend test showed that the proportion of patients taking SSRIs and statins increased significantly across three worsening categories (none, asymptomatic, symptomatic) of vasospasm. Logistic regression analysis showed that SSRI use tended to predict all vasospasm (O.R. 2.01 [0.91 to 4.45]), and predicted symptomatic vasospasm (O.R. 1.42 [1.06 to 4.33]). Statin exposure increased the risk for vasospasm (O.R. 2.75 [1.16 to 6.50]), perhaps from abrupt statin withdrawal (O.R. 2.54 [0.78 to 8.28]). Age < 50 years, Hunt-Hess grade 4 or 5, and Fisher Group 3 independently predicted all vasospasm, symptomatic vasospasm, poor discharge clinical status, and death.",

    "229": "The effect of high acetaldehyde (ACe) on acetylcholine (ACh) release was studied in vivo in the medial frontal cortex (mfc) of freely moving rats using brain microdialysis coupled with high performance liquid chromatography and an electrochemical detector. Ethanol (EtOH) and ACe concentrations were quantified simultaneously in the mfc of awake rats by in vivo microdialysis followed by head-space gas chromatography. Rats were treated intraperitoneally with saline, EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg) or cyanamide (CY, 50 mg/kg, a potent aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) plus EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg). No significant effect on ACh levels was observed in saline groups, as compared to baseline value. The basal level of ACh in the dialysate was about 0.30 +/- 0.04 pmol/20 microl, and this value was reduced significantly in the EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg) and CY + EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg) groups for 240 min after EtOH administration. The time courses of ACh release continued to decrease significantly after EtOH administration in the CY + EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg) groups compared to the values in the saline and EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg) groups. A significant decrease in ACh release was observed from 140 to 240 min after EtOH dosing in the EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg) groups, as compared to saline groups. EtOH and ACe concentrations in the mfc were first determined at 15 min after a dose of EtOH, reached a peak at 30 min and then gradually decreased in the CY + EtOH (1 and 2 g/kg) groups. The present study suggests that both EtOH and ACe concentration in the brain can decrease in vivo ACh release in the mfc of free-moving rats, and the ACe-induced decrease in ACh levels was significantly higher than EtOH.",

Pretreatment with the 5-HT2A agonist (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride blocked the clozapine-induced increase in MEK1/2 phosphorylation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that clozapine treatment elevated the number of cells in the prefrontal cortex positive for phosphoERK, the downstream substrate of MEK1/2. Prior administration of MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 or Sl327, or ERK inhibitor 5-iodotubercidin, reversed suppression of CAR induced by clozapine, whereas administration of vehicle, JNK or p38 inhibitors (L-JNK-1 and SB203580, respectively) had no effect. Inhibition of kinases upstream to MEK1/2 (PI-3K, PKC, and CaMKII) by administration of LY294002, bisindolylmaleimide, or KN-62, respectively, also reversed clozapine-induced suppression of CAR.",

Insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, thrombotic disorders and adiposity define the metabolic syndrome and contribute to endothelial dysfunction and, subsequently, to accelerated atherosclerosis. Angiotensin II contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal endpoints and, as such, angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors demonstrate a protective effect. Ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), appear to impact favourably on atherosclerosis through both direct and indirect mechanisms. In humans, these ligands improve endothelial function, attenuate albuminuria and hypertension, and potentially prevent conversion of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. Statins also have proven benefit in decreasing overall cardiovascular and stroke mortality and morbidity. The combination of angiotensin II blockade, statin therapy and PPAR gamma activation might emerge as an important global therapeutic strategy in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Further studies are needed to determine whether they have synergistic effects to protect the vasculature.", 
    "235": "Pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic process is deemed as multi-factorial, and characterized by chronic inflammatory response. Although hypertension is known to be one of the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis in causasians, its relative contribution to early atherosclerosis are still unknown. Increased evidence has indicated that hypertension, through the vasoactive peptides, such as angiotensin and endothelin-1, promotes and accelerates the atherosclerotic process via inflammatory mechanisms. In animal and human studies pro-inflammatory properties of angiotensin II has been demonstrated in large conduit and small arteries, in the kidney as well as in the heart. Activation of oxidative stress by angiotensin II is a key component of this process. Angiotensin II stimulates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase in endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and the adventitia of blood vessel to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to endothelial dysfunction, growth, and inflammation, upregulation of endothelin-1, adhesion molecules, nuclear factor-kappa B, and other inflammatory mediators, as well as increased breakdown of nitric oxide and uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase, contribute to the progression of vascular disease and atherogenesis. In addition, recent advances concerning role of endothelin-1 as another important mediator of chronic inflammation in the vascular wall has been documented, and relationship between endothelin-1 and angiotensin II on vascular inflammation demonstrated. Inflammatory mechanisms, therefore, are important participants in the pathophysiology of hypertension-related cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. In experimental models as well as human studies of atherosclerosis, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated the ability to prevent or reverse the progression of atherosclerosis, which was in part associated with decreased expression of inflammatory mediators and improve endothelial functions. Based on those increasing evidence, we hypothesize that inflammation may be a bridge connecting hypertension and atherosclerosis.",

The diagnosis was done by bidimensionnal transthoracic echocardiography which showed 2 thrombi in the apical region of the right ventricle and in the anterior and lateral wall of the left ventricle. With treatment associating salt restriction, diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme- inhibitors, the evolution was good: the thrombi disappeared at the first month for the left ventricular thrombi and after 45 days for the rignt ventricular thrombi. The patient didn't experience any embolic complication.",

Anemia, hypertension and rheumatic fever were the causes of heart failure in these 3 patients, but they were not apparent when the initial diagnosis was made. These observations emphasize that, despite the complex hypothesis trying to explain heart failure during the peripartum period, one should think about some frequent causes which can be misdiagnosed because of the pregnant state or the heart failure itself.",

    "241": "Improved recognition of the relationship between childhood and adult blood pressures and identification of end-organ damage in children, adolescents, and young adults with hypertension has led to increased focus by pediatricians and general practitioners on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of hypertension. Notably, detection, evaluation, and treatment of pediatric hypertension has increased significantly since the first Task Force Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents in 1977 with advances in both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril) and calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine) are the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications in children due to their low adverse-effect profiles. Diuretics (e.g. thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics) are usually reserved as adjunct therapy. Newer agents, such as angiotensin receptor antagonists (e.g. irbesartan), are currently being studied in children and adolescents. These agents may be an option in children with chronic cough secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. beta-Adrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and labetalol), alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists, direct vasodilators, peripheral adrenoreceptor neuron agonists, and combination products are less commonly used in pediatric patients because of adverse events but may be an option in children unresponsive to calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "242": "Endothelial dysfunction in the setting of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic smoking, as well as in the setting of heart failure, has been shown to be at least partly dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species in endothelial and/or smooth muscle cells and the adventitia, and the subsequent decrease in vascular bioavailability of NO. Superoxide-producing enzymes involved in increased oxidative stress within vascular tissue include NAD(P)H-oxidase, xanthine oxidase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in an uncoupled state. Recent studies indicate that endothelial dysfunction of peripheral and coronary resistance and conductance vessels represents a strong and independent risk factor for future cardiovascular events. Ways to reduce endothelial dysfunction include risk-factor modification and treatment with substances that have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and, simultaneously, to stimulate endothelial NO production, such as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme or the statins. In contrast, in conditions where increased production of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide, in vascular tissue is established, treatment with NO, e.g. via administration of nitroglycerin, results in a rapid development of endothelial dysfunction, which may worsen the prognosis in patients with established coronary artery disease.", 
    "243": "Aging is associated with changes in cardiac and vascular structure, promoting the development of heart failure. An increase in vascular stiffness leads to an increase of systolic arterial pressure and pulse wave velocity. This augments the afterload of the heart, which contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and neuroendocrine activation in the elderly. On the molecular level the age-associated changes in the sympathetic nervous system are similar to alterations that can be found in congestive heart failure. Therapy of systolic heart failure does not differ between the elderly and younger patients. All drugs which have shown to improve the prognosis of younger patients are indicated in the elderly as well. This holds true for ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists, betablockers and aldosterone antagonists.

Omapatrilat treatment reduced MI size and resulted in beneficial ventricular remodelling as reflected by a reduction in cardiac dimensions by echocardiography, and LV and right ventricular hypertrophy, which resulted in borderline hemodynamic improvement. A large MI resulted in an increased expression of beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-skeletal actin and atrial natriuretic peptide, and a decreased expression of GLUT-4. Omapatrilat treatment did not modify the expression of these genes.",

Both receptors stimulate CREB phosphorylation with similar time courses, and agonist potency was also comparable between the two receptors. Stimulation of cells in Ca(2+)-free medium containing EGTA (100 microm), with or without the additional depletion of intracellular stores, caused marked decreases in agonist-mediated responses in both cell lines. Down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by phorbol ester treatment, or treatment with the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220, partially attenuated both mGlu1a and mGlu5a receptor-mediated responses. Furthermore, stimulation of cells in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) following prior PKC down-regulation resulted in additive inhibitory effects. The involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), Ca(2+)/calmodulin or Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases was assessed using pharmacological inhibitors. Results indicated that coupling of the group I mGlu receptors to CREB phosphorylation occurs independently of these pathways. Thus, although the [Ca(2+)](i) signatures activated by these mGlu receptors differ, they couple to CREB with comparable potency and recruit similar downstream components to execute CREB phosphorylation.",

    "262": "Imidapril is an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, a class of drugs with known cardioprotective activity. It is now known that this is due not only to their antihypertensive activity, but also to the fact that they decrease cellular and tissue levels of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and inducer of myocardial fibrosis. These mechanisms may explain the good clinical results of this class of drugs in the treatment of coronary artery disease and heart failure, two diseases whose etiopathogenesis is closely related to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, the impact of this class of drugs on cardiac mitochondrial function during acute myocardial ischemia is still largely unknown. With the aim of studying the effect of imidapril on cardiac mitochondrial function during acute ischemia, we used an ex-vivo animal model, perfused in a Langerdorff system and then subjected to ischemia in the presence or absence of imidapril. We evaluated mitochondrial membrane electrical potential, respiratory chain O2 consumption, and rate and amplitude of mitochondrial swelling. We conclude that imidapril did not significantly change oxygen consumption by cardiac mitochondria, as assessed by the rate of respiratory state 3 (the state that corresponds to the active phosphorylation phase). However, imidapril significantly increased transmembrane electrical potential and, in ischemic cardiac mitochondria, was able to prevent the calcium-induced increase in the rate and amplitude of mitochondrial swelling, thus enabling better preservation of mitochondrial membrane structure, with consequent improvement of electrical potential after the phosphorylation cycle. These findings enabled a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the cytoprotection provided by imidapril during ischemic cardiomyopathy, clearly highlighting, at a cellular biology level, the importance of pharmacological modulation of cardiac mitochondrial function during acute ischemia.",

The available scientific evidence does not help much to facilitate the choice among the three available strategies of medical treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting. In this area practice-based medicine overwhelms evidence-based medicine. However, existing findings are discussed. The present experience in diabetic patients is highlighted; in such patients surgery is generally recommended but the results obtained by percutaneous coronary intervention with the currently available tools are improving markedly. Pharmacological therapy is also improving, particularly in the prevention of the progression of atherothrombosis and consequently of cardiovascular events. Actually two categories of drugs should be recognized: those prescribed to prevent death and myocardial infarction and those with antianginal and anti-ischemic effects aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing ischemia. The first group of drugs includes antiplatelet-antithrombotic agents, lipid-lowering agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; the second group includes beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates. A good integration of the two classes of drugs, combined with an appropriate use of coronary revascularization procedures, should yield the maximum possible benefit in the individual patient.",

Although Benazepril is being widely used in antihypertensive medication, the agent is efficacious in only a portion of hypertensive patients. To evaluate the interaction of alpha-adducin gene Gly460Trp and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene I/D polymorphisms in regard to baseline blood pressure (BP) levels and the reductions of blood pressures after Benazepril treatment, we conducted an investigation of 954 Chinese hypertensive patients in Anhui province, China. We found that compared with the baseline systolic BP (SBP) of subjects with one ACE I allele and one alpha-adducin Trp allele, the baseline SBP of those with ACE DD and alpha-adducin Gly/Gly genotypes was significantly higher [Crude: beta(SE) = 7.83(3.09), p = .01; Adjusted: beta(SE) = 5.83(2.83), p = .04]. However, no associations were found between the interaction of ACE I/D and alpha-adducin Gly460Trp polymorphisms and the baseline diastolic BP or the BP response to Benazepril treatment. Our results suggested that the interaction effect of alpha-adducin Gly460Trp and ACE I/D polymorphisms might play a significant role in regulating baseline BP but not BP response to Benazepril.", 
    "270": "Interaction between an enhanced action of kinins and cytokines is accepted as important to the cardioprotective effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. Kinins mediate their effects through B1 and B2 subtype receptors that may be modulated by cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1beta. We examined expression of kinin receptors and the effects of bradykinin (B2 agonist) and des-Arg10-kallidin (B1 agonist) on extracellular matrix components of adult rat cardiac fibroblasts with or without prior exposure to IL-1beta. We compared responses of cells cultured from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) hearts. mRNA levels of kinin receptors, procollagens, promatrix metalloproteinases (proMMP-2 and proMMP-9), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) were all assessed by a semiquantitative RT-PCR. In the absence of IL-1beta, SHR cells expressed more B2 receptor, procollagen alpha1(I), procollagen alpha1(III), and proMMP-9 mRNA than WKY cells. IL-1beta exposure enhanced B1, B2, proMMP-2, and proMMP-9 mRNA in cells of both strains to equivalent levels. Zymographic studies confirmed the results of proMMPs. Following IL-1beta treatment, bradykinin attenuated procollagens alpha1(I) and alpha1(III) mRNA expression in SHR but not WKY cells. In contrast, des-Arg10-kallidin did not show any significant effects in either SHR or WKY cells. Our findings indicate greater extracellular matrix turnover in cultured SHR cardiac fibroblasts than WKY under basal conditions, an IL-1beta stimulation of turnover in cells from both strains, and a strain-differential effect of bradykinin following cytokine treatment. These results imply a genetically determined response of cardiac extracellular matrix and the potential of direct enhancement of the efficacy of kinins by the local release of IL-1beta in hearts genetically programmed to exhibit excessive remodeling to injury.", 
    "271": "Recent studies have shown that angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor-mediated Akt activation induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation in vitro. However, the critical signal transductions affecting the VSMC phenotype remain unclear in vivo. We examined whether signal transduction through AT1 receptor-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) could regulate the VSMC phenotype in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs). Male SHRSPs were randomized and treated for 6 weeks with a vehicle, an ACE inhibitor cilazapril, or an AT1 receptor antagonist E4177. The 2 drugs showed equipotent effects on the blood pressure, aortic morphology, and collagen deposition. Both drugs also significantly reduced aortic NAD(P)H oxidase activity and p38MAPK and ERK expression, whereas p-Akt, eNOS, and SM2 were significantly increased in SHRSP aortas. Furthermore, E4177 was more effective than cilazapril at inducing VSMC differentiation by reducing NAD(P)H oxidase activity, and up-regulating p-Akt, eNOS, and SM2. Thus, an ACE inhibitor and an AT1 receptor antagonist inhibited VSMC dedifferentiation through inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity and up-regulation of eNOS and Akt in SHRSP aortas, suggesting that in contrast to the in vitro experiments, AT1 receptor-mediated NAD(P)H oxidase-generated ROS, eNOS, and Akt might be crucial determinants for the VSMC phenotype in hypertension in vivo.", 
    "272": "There is experimental evidence of an interaction between the angiotensin system and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a block of the angiotensin system achieved both by ACE inhibition and angiotensin II-AT1 receptor blockade could affect the plasma lipid profile and, if so, what relationship exists between these possible changes and glucose metabolism and blood pressure. In 50 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, treated with diabetes drugs and enalapril, we evaluated the glycemic and lipid profile together with the HOMA insulin-resistance index, blood pressure and microalbuminuria at baseline and 3 months after the addition of valsartan. At the second evaluation, blood pressure was reduced as expected, whereas the glycemic profile, the HOMA index, and the body mass index were unchanged. Total cholesterol, LDL-c, and apoprotein B were reduced during combination therapy (P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P = 0.004, respectively), plasma HDL-c was slightly though significantly increased (P = 0.024), whereas apoprotein A and triglyceride levels did not change. After adjustment for the insulin resistance index and for blood pressure, the reduction of LDL-c and apoprotein B and the increase in HDL-c remained significant. The variation in lipid profile was not related to the changes in blood pressure. Moreover, the addition of valsartan to enalapril was associated with a reduction in microalbuminuria, which remained significant after adjustment for LDL-c or blood pressure changes. Thus, the greater degree of renin-angiotensin system blockade or specific pharmacodynamic effects of valsartan could account for the changes in plasma lipid profile observed in this study.",

This study aimed to verify the antiatherosclerotic effects of ACE inhibition on an experimental model of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Diabetes was induced in New Zealand male rabbits with a single dose of alloxan (100 mg/kg, i.v.), and, according to plasma glucose levels obtained after 1 week, the animals were divided into 2 groups (> or =250 mg/dL or <250 mg/dL). Each group was randomly assigned to receive or not quinapril (30 mg/d) added to a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet. Animals with high glucose levels at 1 week and that remained high after 12 weeks presented higher triglyceride levels (P < 0.02 versus basal). Those initially hyperglycemic but presenting <250 mg/dL glucose at the end of study formed an additional group. Plasma ACE activity was lower in quinapril-treated animals (P < 0.01 versus untreated groups). However, aorta intima/media ratio and intima area were lower only in the subgroups of quinapril-treated animals with low glucose levels (P < 0.05). Our results support the hypothesis that high plasma glucose may abolish the antiatherosclerotic effect of ACE inhibitors.",

New York Heart Association functional class IV, third heart sound, jugular vein congestion, cardiomegaly, radiological signs of lung oedema, pathological Q waves, left bundle branch block, sinus rhythm, ischaemic cardiopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy were all significantly more prevalent in the group with deteriorated systolic function, as was treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and most other antihypertensive drugs on discharge from hospital. There was no significant difference in survival between the groups with preserved and deteriorated systolic function (either survival regardless of age at admission or in subgroups aged < 75 and > or = 75 years at admission). In the whole group, survival rates after one, three, and five years were 84.0%, 66.7%, and 50.9%, respectively.",

Both losartan and captopril inhibited high glucose-induced upregulation of TGF-beta1 and fibronectin expression in HPMC in a dose-dependent manner. Antioxidant catalase and NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodinium effectively inhibited Ang II-induced TGF-beta1 and fibronectin protein expression.",

To characterize the functional interaction between cell infiltration and matrix expansion, this study compared the immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), intended as primarily anti-inflammatory intervention, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, intended as primarily an anti-fibrotic drug, and a combination of both as anticipated anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic intervention. The model used was anti-thy1-induced chronic-progressive glomerulosclerosis (cGS) in the rat, where a brief anti-thy1-induced glomerular injury progresses spontaneously toward tubulointerstitial fibrosis and renal insufficiency. cGS was induced by injection of anti-thy1 antibody into uninephrectomized Wistar rats. One week after disease induction, animals were randomly assigned to the following groups: cGS, cGS plus MMF (20 mg.kg body wt(-1).day(-1)), cGS plus high-dose enalapril (12 mg.kg body wt(-1).day(-1)), and cGS plus both. At week 16 after disease induction, MMF or enalapril alone reduced signs of chronic renal disease significantly and similarly compared with the untreated cGS group. Variables measured included proteinuria, blood pressure, tubulointerstitial and glomerular matrix accumulation, expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1), fibronectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, plasma creatinine and urea levels, and glomerular filtration rate. Combined MMF and enalapril treatment was not superior to single therapy. In conclusion, MMF slows the progression of chronic renal fibrosis and renal insufficiency as effectively as high-dose enalapril in the anti-thy1-induced chronic-progressive glomerulosclerosis model. The dual anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic intervention does not yield additive renoprotective effects, indicating that MMF and enalapril interfere with similar or very closely related pathways involved in progression of renal disease.",

Recent developments have undoubtedly indicated that inflammation is pathophysiologically closely linked to atherogenesis and its clinical consequences. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocyte count and complement component 3 (C3) have been linked to CHD and to hyperlipidaemia and several other CHD risk factors. Increases in these markers may result from activation of endothelial cells (CRP, leucocytes, C3), disturbances in adipose tissue fatty acid metabolism (CRP, C3), or from direct effects of CHD risk factors (leucocytes). It has been shown that lipoproteins, triglycerides, fatty acids and glucose can activate endothelial cells, most probably as a result of the production of reactive oxygen species. Similar mechanisms may also lead to leucocyte activation. Increases in triglycerides, fatty acids and glucose are common disturbances in the metabolic syndrome and are most prominent in the postprandial phase. People are in a postprandial state most of the day, and this phase is proatherogenic. Inhibition of the activation of leucocytes, endothelial cells, or both, is an interesting target for intervention, as activation is obligatory for adherence of leucocytes to the endothelium, thereby initiating atherogenesis. Potential interventions include the use of unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, polyphenols, antioxidants, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and high-dose aspirin, which have direct anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects. Furthermore, peroxisome proliferator activating receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists and statins have similar properties, which are in part independent of their lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "321": "Remodeling of the arterial wall occurs mainly as a consequence of increased wall stress caused by hypertension. In this issue of the JCI, Azizi et al. report that in humans with a kallikrein gene polymorphism that lowers kallikrein activity, the brachial artery undergoes eutrophic inward remodeling in the absence of hypertension or other hemodynamic changes. It has also been reported that alterations of the kallikrein-kinin system are associated with formation of aortic aneurysms. Conversely, after vascular injury, kinins mediate the beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that prevent neointima formation. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that decreased kallikrein-kinin system activity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling and disease, while increased activity may have a beneficial effect.",

    "323": "Several metallopeptidases have been reported to be involved in bradykinin (BK) B(1) receptor agonist metabolism. Our goal was to evaluate in vitro roles of metallopeptidases [e.g., neutral endopeptidase (NEP), aminopeptidase M (APM), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)] as functional inactivators of the selective BKB(1) receptor agonist Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK (DAKD) in isolated human umbilical artery (HUA) rings. Concentration-response curves (CRCs) to DAKD were performed after a 5-h incubation period. Treatment with 10 microM phosphoramidon (NEP inhibitor) or 10 microM amastatin (APM inhibitor) potentiated DAKD-elicited responses, whereas 1 microM captopril (ACE inhibitor) had no significant effects. However, when the three enzymes were simultaneously inhibited, a significant potentiation over responses obtained under concurrent NEP and aminopeptidase M inhibition was observed. In contrast, responses induced by the peptidase resistant BKB(1) receptor agonist Sar-D-Phe(8)-des-Arg(9)-BK were not modified by triple peptidase inhibition. In addition, endothelial denudation failed to alter DAKD-induced responses in HUA. Finally, in the presence of NEP, ACE, and APM inhibition, Lys-des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-BK, the potent BKB(1) receptor antagonist, produced a parallel, concentration-dependent, rightward shift of DAKD CRCs. The obtained pK(B) (8.57) and the Schild slope not different from unity are in agreement with an interaction at a single homogeneous BKB(1) receptor population. In summary, this work constitutes the first pharmacological evidence that metallopeptidases NEP, APM, and ACE represent a relevant inactivation mechanism of the endogenous BKB(1) receptor agonist DAKD in isolated HUA.",

This anti-proteinuric effect was even greater after 9 months of therapy: losartan, 44.2% (p = 0.02); enalapril, 49.6% (p = 0.02); and combined therapy, 51% (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference between losartan and enalapril with respect to their impact on proteinuria level. Proteinuria reduction was significantly greater in patients receiving combined therapy in comparison with losartan treatment after 3 months of therapy (p = 0.02). Creatinine clearance and serum creatinine were stable during the entire study period in all patients. No significant changes in lipids, serum uric acid or protein levels were observed.",

They measured the changes in the BBB permeability using the Evans blue (EB) dye and concomitantly in the levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in serum and nitric oxide in plasma. The authors performed two tight junction-specific proteins, zonula occludens-1 and occludin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, by using immunohisto-chemical method. The serum levels of TNF-a, IL-1 IL-6, and the plasma level of nitric oxide significantly increased in LPS-treated rats (p<.01). The EB dye extravasation increased in cerebellum (p<.001) and diencephalon (p<.05) of L-NAME plus ANG II-treated animals. However, LPS reduced the increased EB dye extravasation in the brain regions of L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats treated with ANG II (p<.001). In L-NAME, there was a considerable loss of staining in both zonula occludens-1 and occludin. Staining for zonula occludens-1 and occludin was highly intensive in animals treated with LPS. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining was seen in a few astrocytes in brains of L-NAME-treated animals. However, this staining showed an increased intensity in the brain sections of animals treated with LPS. This study indicates that, in L-NAME hypertensive rats, ANG II leads to an increase in the extravasation of EB dye to brain as a result of decreased activity of tight junction proteins and astrocytes, and LPS could significantly attenuate the EB dye transport to the brain through the increased activity of tight junction proteins and astrocytes.",

Therapies in heart failure are not truly life saving; they modify the natural history of the disease and delay the time to deterioration. The time benefit in survival is not usually reported in clinical trials, which are conducted over fixed time points and report risk reductions during this period only.

Five patients in the high-concentration group reached end-stage renal failure whereas none in the low-concentration group did (P=0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in blood pressure level, concomitant antihypertensive therapy or urinary albumin excretion.

Activity tolerance increased by 39.2% (p < 0.001), and echoCG found a 16.5% increase of LV ejection fraction (p < 0.05). Conjunctival biomicroscopy showed that moexipril substantially improved microcirculation (MC); total conjunctival index significantly decreased by 21.7%.

In all, 148 patients qualified for the EF increase group and 59 patients for the EF decrease group. LVEF on average increased from 33 +/- 4% to 51 +/- 8% in the EF increase group and decreased from 35 +/- 4% to 25 +/- 5% in the EF decrease group. The strongest multivariable predictor of improvement of LVEF was beta-blocker therapy (odds ratio 3.9, p = 0.002). The strongest independent predictor of LVEF decrease was the presence of a permanent right ventricular apical pacemaker (odds ratio 6.6, p = 0.002). Thus, this study identified beta-blocker therapy as the major independent predictor for improvement in LVEF of > or =10 points, whereas a permanent pacemaker (right ventricular apical pacing) was the strongest predictor of a LVEF decrease of > or =7 points.",

A total of 12,600 high-risk hypertensives have been randomised and will be followed for 3 - 5years, during which cardiovascular events will be monitored. The investigators hypothesise that the benazepril plus amlodipine regimen will decrease cardiovascular events by 15% compared with benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Recruitment began in 2003, and the trial is expected to end in 2008. The ACCOMPLISH trial shares important limitations with many other recent trials that will make it difficult to apply the results in clinical practice. These include the focus on high-risk hypertensive patients, in whom significant reductions in relative risk will translate into meaningful reductions in absolute risk: in lower-risk hypertensives with a low absolute risk, similar relative risk reductions may not be of great impact on the population disease burden. In ACCOMPLISH, as in most industry-sponsored clinical trials, the main goal appears to be market-driven: doses of drugs tested are not those available for clinical practice. The question asked, whether the combination of benazepril with either diuretic or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is more efficacious, is not a clinically compelling one. Finally, the univariate subgroup analyses proposed are unlikely to lead to an understanding of whether either combination has specific advantages for patients encountered clinically, most of whom have multiple risk factors. Thus, it appears that ACCOMPLISH, as with many recent pharmacological trials, will not greatly impact the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "351": "Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are cytoplasmic proteins that are activated in response to stimulation from various cytokines. Among these, STAT3 is an important member that has been implicated in the inflammatory proliferation of cells. We hypothesized that STAT3 may be activated in kidneys of rats having modified chronic immune complex glomerulonephritis, and that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with fosinopril may prevent the activation of STAT3 and subsequent upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), which are effects that may explain the therapeutic effects of fosinopril on nephritis.", 
    "352": "Fifty-one Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups that included a control group, a model group and a fosinopril group. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) nephritis was induced by subcutaneous immunization and daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of BSA. To accentuate the nephritis, we performed uni-nephrectomy and gave 100 microg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an i.p. injection. Macrophage infiltration (ED-1) was assessed with immunohistochemistry. The expression and activation of STAT3 and the expression of TIMP-1, one of the STAT3 downstream genes, were observed in renal tissues of rats by means of immunohistochemistry, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), western blot and northern blot. The relationships between STAT3 phosphorylation, 24 h urinary protein excretion and TIMP-1 expression were also analysed.", 
    "353": "Northern blot showed that the mRNA expression of both STAT3 and TIMP-1 was significantly increased in kidneys from the model group, but significantly decreased in the fosinopril group (P<0.05). Western blot analysis revealed similar increases in the expression of STAT3, phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and TIMP-1 in the model group. Analysis of immunohistochemistry showed that STAT3 and p-STAT3 were expressed in very few cells of normal rats, that expression was strong in model rats and that this increased expression was attenuated in the fosinopril group (P<0.05). The expression of p-STAT3 in glomeruli was positively correlated with 24 h proteinuria as well as with glomerular TIMP-1 expression. Double staining showed that some ED-1-positive cells also contained p-STAT3-positive staining.", 
    "354": "The present study showed that STAT3 is expressed and activated in kidneys of rats with modified immune complex glomerulonephritis. These rats also had increased ED-1-positive cells, with some cells showing simultaneous expression of p-STAT3 and ED-1, which may contribute to glomerular inflammatory proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Finally, fosinopril downregulated STAT3 activation and ED-1 influx, which are effects that may attenuate renal damage in this model.", 
    "355": "BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) and anaemia are both associated with adverse outcome in patients with chronic heart failure. Whether low haemoglobin levels are independently predictive of elevated BNP levels in subjects without heart failure is unknown. In the present study, we examined the relationship between haemoglobin and BNP levels in 234 patients with suspected coronary heart disease without a history of chronic heart failure, adjusting for known predictors of BNP levels. By univariate analysis, haemoglobin levels were inversely related to logarithmically transformed BNP values (r = -0.30, P < 0.0001). After adjustment for patient age, gender, body mass index, history of myocardial infarction, use of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, estimated creatinine clearance rate, extent of coronary disease, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, blood haemoglobin remained an independent predictor of plasma BNP (standardized beta-coefficient = -0.253, P < 0.0001). A similar relationship was observed between haematocrit and BNP (standardized beta-coefficient -0.215, P < 0.0001). We conclude that haemoglobin levels are independently predictive of plasma BNP levels in patients with suspected coronary heart disease without heart failure. Anaemia may contribute to elevated BNP levels in the absence of heart failure, and may represent an important confounder of the relationship between BNP, cardiac function and prognosis.", 
    "356": "Due to excessive salt and water retention, hypertension often becomes refractory in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Management of high blood pressure (BP) appears to be of particular importance in such patients because of its substantial impact on the patients' prognosis. However, attempts to control hypertension in PD patients have not been successful in most cases. In this regard, the present study aimed to address the adequacy of current antihypertensive therapy for PD patients. A new antihypertensive strategy expected to improve the outcome was tested on the assumption that treatment with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in the evening together with alpha1-blocker at bed time and long-acting Ca channel blocker (CCB) in the morning might ameliorate BP control associated with morning hypertension. Enrolled in the present study were 40 patients whose BP was evaluated by both office and home measurement. Due to an emerging concern about morning hypertension, home BP measured early in the morning was used for the analysis. Each patient was categorized into the following four groups in accordance with office and home BP: well-controlled, poorly-controlled, white-coat and masked (opposite to white-coat), hypertension. After the observation period, 28 patients with refractory hypertension were allocated to intensive antihypertensive therapy in which ARB or ACE-I previously prescribed in the morning or daytime was shifted to the night. In addition, alpha1-blocker was given at bed time. Furthermore, long-acting CCB and diuretics were shifted to the morning. The patients were then followed up for 4-6 months. The results were as follows: 1) Of the total number of 40 PD patients, systolic hypertension was noted in 50% of cases by office BP and in 80% by home BP. The former was less frequent than the latter (p=0.0047, n=40). Similarly, diastolic hypertension was noted in 20% by office BP and in 45% by home BP. The former was less frequent than the latter (p=0.0045, n=40 by McNemar's analysis). The distribution of BP control categories was well-controlled in 11%, poorly-controlled in 42%, masked hypertension in 39% and white-coat hypertension in 8% when determined by systolic BP. The distribution was well-controlled in 45%, poorly-controlled in 13%, masked hypertension in 34% and white-coat hypertension in 8% of cases when determined by diastolic BP. 2) In 28 patients subjected to the intensive therapy, the control category of systolic BP was changed from 11 to 37% in well-controlled cases, from 42 to 30% in poorly-controlled cases, from 39 to 26% in masked hypertension cases and from 8 to 7% in white-coat hypertension cases. The shift in categories in both poorly-controlled and masked hypertension cases to the better category (well-controlled), was statistically significant (p=0.001, by Wilcoxon's signed rank test). Similarly, the control category of diastolic BP was changed from 45 to 43% in well-controlled cases, from 13 to 15% in poorly-controlled cases, from 34 to 32% in masked hypertension cases and from 8 to 10% in white-coat hypertension cases. There was a tendency for the prevalence of poorly-controlled and masked hypertension to improve to the well-controlled category in response to intensive therapy (p=0.0625, by Wilcoxon's signed rank test). 3) The plasma concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1)/tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) complex (total PAI-1 complex) was significantly decreased after intensive therapy (17.3+/-7.8 ng/ml vs. 13.5+/-4.6 ng/ml, n=28, p<0.01 by paired t-test). In contrast, the plasma concentration of t-PA was unchanged even after intensive therapy (4.8+/-3.9 ng/ml vs. 6.2+/-2.9 ng/ml, n=28, ns). These data suggest that home BP obtained in the morning is a useful measure for evaluating morning hypertension in PD patients, most of whom have refractory hypertension categorized as either poorly-controlled or masked hypertension. Intensive treatment with ACE-I/ARB given in the evening along with alpha1-blocker at bed time combined with a diuretic and/or long-acting CCB in the morning is efficacious in controlling the BP of patients with refractory hypertension in PD patients. The link between the reduction in plasma total PAI-1 levels and the intensive therapy may suggest that this therapeutic strategy could prevent thrombotic events associated with morning hypertension in patients on PD.",

In the kidney, an increase in chymase activity was reported in an animal model of ischemic kidney of renovascular hypertension (RVH); however, no such evidence has been provided in humans. We treated a 64-year-old patient with severe unilateral RVH and atherosclerosis, for whom removal of the ischemic kidney was the only option. Using immunohistochemical staining, we investigated chymase activity in the removed kidney and associated artery and vein. An increase in chymase activity, together with mast cells infiltrating the interstitium, was observed where interstitial fibrosis was seen. In the renal artery, where severe atherosclerosis was seen, and also in the vein, mast cell infiltration in the adventitia was accompanied by chymase. The captopril test showed an increase in serum aldosterone level, with a concomitant increase in plasma renin activity and decrease in blood pressure. Because the decrease in blood pressure implies a decrease in circulatory AII levels, it is plausible that in this patient, chymase had a role in AII formation in the adrenal gland to stimulate aldosterone secretion. Thus, by means of captopril, AI levels increased, and chymase may have produced AII in loci tissues, which, in turn, stimulated aldosterone secretion. This is the first report of an increase in chymase activity in the interstitium of an ischemic kidney and renal artery and vein in a patient with RVH and atherosclerosis.",

The BK-NO pathway might contribute, at least in part, to the pronounced effect of ACEi. On the other hand, the underlying mechanisms affecting insulin sensitivity might differ for both treatments.

While diabetes is now the most common cause of renal failure, hypertension commonly coexists, exacerbating renal damage and the other vascular complications of diabetes.

These strategies include: lifestyle modification programs to prevent diabetes and hypertension; aggressive treatment of established hypertension; combination antihypertensive regimens; and the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for additional renoprotection beyond that of blood pressure control.

Compared with WKY, SHR showed a significant increase in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and fibrosis, blood pressure (BP), and vascular remodeling of the intramyocardial arteries, and a significant decrease in endothelial NO synthase and the contractile-type myosin heavy chain isoform SM2 of the intramyocardial arteries as well as calponin 1 and GATA-6. In the hearts of SHR, both drugs equivalently and significantly reduced BP, which was still significantly higher than that in the WKY groups, and also reduced LV hypertrophy and fibrosis, whereas endothelial NO synthase was significantly restored. Although both drugs showed little effect on the vascular remodeling of the intramyocardial arteries in the SHR hearts, FK-739, but not enalapril, significantly restored SM2 and GATA-6 in the SHR hearts to the same levels as those of the vehicle WKY group. The effects of the two drugs on these indices were not observed in the three WKY hearts. Thus, the AT1 receptor antagonist may modulate the SM cell phenotype toward the contractile-type more effectively than the ACE inhibitor before the morphological changes occur in the intramyocardial arteries of the SHR hearts.",

We evaluated whether inhibiting the NF-kappaB cascade with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) affected hypertrophy. We measured NF-kappaB signaling components [NF-kappaB translocation, IkappaBalpha, p65, mRNA and protein levels, and IkappaB kinase-beta (IKKbeta) activity] at 12 and 36 wk in WKYs and SHRs and at 10 wk in PDTC-treated rats (n = 9). NF-kappaB activation was also evaluated in rats treated for 10 wk with captopril or hydralazine alone or with either drug plus PDTC. All components were increased in SHRs compared with WKYs. After PDTC treatment, NF-kappaB activity was inhibited, and heart weight-to-body weight ratio in SHRs was significantly attenuated (3.52 +/- 0.04 to 3.32 +/- 0.05 mg/kg). Captopril treatment significantly reduced cardiac mass (3.5 vs. 3.05 mg/kg; n = 9) and inhibited NF-kappaB activity (169.71 +/- 5.70 to 106.7 +/- 12.44). Hydralazine had no effect on cardiac mass (3.5 vs. 3.42 mg/kg) or NF-kappaB activity (169.71 +/- 5.70 to 155.52 +/- 6.11). Hydralazine plus PDTC reduced blood pressure (191.16 +/- 1.7 to 158.5 +/- 2.36 mmHg) and inhibited NF-kappaB activity (169.71 +/- 5.70 to 97.29 +/- 3.65). Our data suggest that 1) cardiac hypertrophy in SHRs is partly due to NF-kappaB activation, 2) inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by PDTC parallels regression of hypertrophy, and 3) regression of hypertrophy is partly due to inhibition of NF-kappaB activity, independent of hypertension. The relationship between NF-kappaB activity and cardiac remodeling is causal, not coincidental.",

We undertook a series of investigations to try and elucidate the cause of these reactions. Since the majority of the patients were taking ACE inhibitors, attention was focused on contact phase activation. Healthy and uremic plasma were incubated with different components of the HFR circuit. The activated carbon caused a moderate activation of factor XII and production of kallikrein, while there was no activation for the lines, double filter or resin. Patients taking ACE inhibitors may be at risk for treatments involved with contact phase activation as ACE inhibitors also block the degradation of bradykinin.

    "397": "Recent studies have suggested that primary hyperaldosteronism may be present in more than 10% of patients with hypertension. We aimed to estimate the prevalence in unselected patients in primary care, and investigate the influence of current drug treatment upon the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) and its prediction of blood pressure response to spironolactone. We measured blood pressure, plasma electrolytes, renin activity and aldosterone in 846 patients with hypertension. Spironolactone 50 mg was prescribed for one month to patients with blood pressure > or = 130/85 mmHg and ARR > or = 400. The primary outcome measure was to discover the proportion of patients with plasma aldosterone > or = 400 pmol/l and ARR > or = 800 and either an adrenal adenoma on computed tomography scan or a systolic blood pressure response to spironolactone > or = 20 mmHg. Only one patient had an adenoma, and only 16 (1.8%) had both a plasma aldosterone > or = 400 pmol/l and ARR > or = 800. By contrast, 119 patients (14.1%) had an elevated ARR but normal plasma aldosterone. In 69 patients out of the 119 who received spironolactone, blood pressure fell by 26/11 mmHg. These patients were normokalaemic but had uncontrolled hypertension despite multiple drugs. The response to spironolactone was best predicted by a low plasma renin, < or = 0.5 pmol/ml/h (<10 mU/l), despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor. We concluded that adrenal adenomas are an uncommon cause of hypertension. In the absence of hypokalaemia, a low plasma renin is a sufficient and simple way of detecting spironolactone-responders among patients with resistant hypertension. Only patients with both hypokalaemia and low plasma renin, measured while the patient is off beta blockade, require measurement of aldosterone. A plasma aldosterone >400 pmol/l together with renin activity < or = 0.5 pmol/ml/h should trigger further investigations for an adrenal adenoma.", 
    "398": "The first-dose induced decrease in blood pressure in some patients following the administration of ACE inhibitors is a fact causing some concern among clinicians prescribing these drugs. However, an overview of clinical trials and the authors' own experience clearly point to the possibility of reducing the incidence and/or severity of first-dose hypotension. Apart from appropriate clinical measures to be taken, the choice of the ACE inhibitor seems to be of crucial importance as some (fosinopril, perindopril) produce less hypotension than others. Thus, with due circumspection, ACE inhibitors can safely retain their position as the cornerstone of the treatment of chronic heart failure.", 
    "399": "Development of microalbuminuria increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes. The nature of this relationship is unclear but may involve arterial stiffness, an independent risk marker for CVD mortality. Aortic pulse wave velocity (Ao-PWV) and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) were measured in 134 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes without overt renal impairment (serum creatinine <150 micromol/L). ACR ranged from 0.2 to 153 mg/mmol. Patients with raised ACR (>/=3 mg/mmol) had higher Ao-PWV, poorer diabetic control, and higher pulse pressure (PP) and systolic BP (SBP) (all P < 0.05) than those with normal ACR. The closest univariate associations of Ao-PWV were positively with age, duration of diabetes, SBP, PP, ACR, and insulin treatment and negatively with GFR and weight (all P < 0.01). In a multiple linear step-down regression analysis, the significant predictors of Ao-PWV were age, SBP or PP, duration of diabetes, gender, number of antihypertensive medications, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which together explained 55% of the variance of Ao-PWV. When ACR was offered in place of arterial pressure to a separate model, ACR emerged as a significant predictor of Ao-PWV. After age adjustment, patients with lower, below median GFR had higher Ao-PWV than those with GFR above the median (P = 0.043). In patients with type 2 diabetes without overt renal impairment, raised ACR is associated with higher Ao-PWV, a relationship most likely mediated by raised BP. The association of Ao-PWV with reduced GFR suggests that even modest renal dysfunction may affect the viscoelastic properties of large arteries.",

Hydrolysis products of infused BK (R(1)-F(5) and R(1)-P(7)) did not elicit PHR. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is concentrated in the perivenous region and B2R in the periportal region. Microphysiometry showed that BK (and not a B1 agonist) interacts with stellate cells and the endothelial sinusoidal/Kupffer cell fraction. This effect was inhibited by the B2R antagonist.",

Studies of baroreceptor reflex showed that only dogs in group 2 had decreased sensitivity to PE without changing the setpoint. No change of the reflex was found in other groups.

The aim of this study was to determine the specific ACE domain primarily responsible for degradation of A beta. For this purpose, a series of ACE recombinant proteins, each containing only one intact domain, was constructed and expressed in COS7. Our results showed that all ACE recombinant proteins obtained were enzymatically active in terms of angiotensin I cleavage. However, inhibition of A beta aggregation and cytotoxicity of the N-domain were higher than those of the C-domain. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analyses confirmed that the N domain degraded A beta.

    "448": "Aspiration of the oropharyngeal or gastric contents by elderly persons often leads to lower respiratory tract infections, such as aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. The existence of dysphagia and aspiration in elderly patients are important factors in the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia, but are not sufficient to cause aspiration pneumonia in the absence of other risk factors. Salivary flow and swallowing can eliminate Gram-negative bacilli from the oropharynx in healthy persons. However, elderly persons may have diminished production of saliva as a result of medications and oral/dental disease, leading to poor oral hygiene and oropharyngeal colonisation with pathogenic organisms. When dysphagic patients aspirate pathogenic bacteria while swallowing food or liquids, they must also have decreased defences, such as impaired immunity or pulmonary clearance, in order to develop aspiration pneumonia.Elderly patients with cerebrovascular disease often have dysphagia that leads to an increased incidence of aspiration. It was previously reported that patients with silent cerebral infarction affecting the basal ganglia were more likely to experience subclinical aspiration and an increased incidence of pneumonia. Basal ganglia infarction leads to the impairment of dopamine metabolism and, as a consequence, a decrease of substance P in the glossopharyngeal nerve and sensory vagal nerves. Therefore, dysphagia and a decreased cough reflex may be induced by the impairment of dopamine metabolism in some elderly patients with cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that pharmaceutical agents which modulate dopamine metabolism may be able to improve swallowing and the cough reflex in patients with basal ganglia infarction. The main strategy for controlling aspiration and aspiration-related pulmonary infection in the elderly is to prevent aspiration of pathogenic bacteria along with the oropharyngeal or gastric contents. Because aspiration pneumonia in the elderly is related to certain risk factors, including dysphagia and aspiration, effective preventive measures involve various approaches, such as pharmacological therapy, swallowing training, dietary management, oral hygiene and positioning.", 
    "449": "Candesartan cilexetil is the orally administered pro-drug of candesartan, a highly selective antagonist of the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor that mediates the pressor activities of angiotensin II. Candesartan cilexetil is widely used for the treatment of hypertension and has recently been approved in Europe for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function. Results of the CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity) programme suggest that oral candesartan cilexetil reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with CHF and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < or =40%. There are cardiovascular benefits when candesartan cilexetil is administered as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor, or as an add-on to current treatment regimens that include an ACE inhibitor, in symptomatic CHF. While tolerability is generally good, renal monitoring is required. The recent approval of candesartan cilexetil as both add-on and alternative therapy to ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF and impaired LV systolic function recognises the cardiovascular benefits of candesartan cilexetil in both types of treatment regimens.",

Our assumptions about the underlying mechanisms are based on the combination of extrapolations from idiopathic membranous nephritis (mainly from animal models) and proliferative lupus nephritis. Natural history studies of MLN suggest a relatively low rate of progression to end-stage renal disease but a high rate of significant comorbidities. Historical changes in the criteria for pathologic diagnosis and classification of membranous lupus nephropathy have precluded definitive descriptions of the natural history, prognosis and treatment of this disorder. Patients with membranous lupus nephropathy should be treated early with angiotensin antagonists to minimize proteinuria, as well as lifestyle changes and appropriate drugs to reduce attendant cardiovascular risk factors. In patients with protracted nephrotic syndrome, consideration should be given to immunosuppressive therapies, including corticosteroids, cyclosporine, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide. Prospective controlled trials are clearly needed in order to establish solid clinical practice guidelines for use of these drugs and other experimental therapies currently under study in membranous lupus nephropathy.",

Indeed, in the Syst-EUR study a 42% reduction in strokes was achieved in the calcium antagonist arm when compared to the placebo arm.It is hypothesised that antihypertensive agents that stimulate the AT2-receptor (thiazide diuretics, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers) are more cerebroprotective than drug classes that do not stimulate the AT2-receptor (beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors).The angiotensin receptor blockers are the only drug class that have a dual mechanism of action that could be helpful in preventing strokes in that they not only inhibit the AT1-receptor but also allow stimulation of the AT2-receptor. Not surprisingly therefore, in trials such as LIFE, VALUE and MOSES, angiotensin receptor blockers showed excellent cerebroprotection.",

Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of medication prescription. Preserved systolic function was documented in 37%, moderate-severe systolic dysfunction in 31%, mild systolic in 14%, and 18% had inadequate documentation. The mean age was 69 years, 58% were women, 24% African American, and 60% were Medicare patients. Patients without HF type documented were the least aggressively treated. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes predicted increased utilization of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker therapies. History of nephropathy was associated with less ACE inhibitor prescription. Advancing age predicted less utilization of beta-blockers and spironolactone. Neither ethnicity nor gender influenced medication prescription.",

Digitalis use was assessed at baseline and baseline demographic variables were catalogued and compared. A multivariate analysis, incorporating known covariates of risk for adverse cardiovascular events, was used to examine the association of digitalis with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, death from heart failure, and arrhythmic death, with, or without, worsening heart failure in women compared with men. Analysis for an interaction between digitalis and gender on mortality was also performed. No interaction between gender and digitalis treatment on survival was found, and there was no significant difference in the hazard ratios for men and women on digitalis either with respect to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure mortality, or arrhythmic death with worsening heart failure. When mortality for arrhythmic death without worsening heart failure was adjusted for the probability of being treated with digitalis (propensity analysis), women fared better than men.",

The aims of the present study were to investigate, in the New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rat model, the effects of treatment with simvastatin, alone or in combination with valsartan or enalapril, on blood pressure (BP) and structural remodelling of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) and of the basilar artery, an artery that plays a major role in the regulation of cerebral resistance. 2. Genetically hypertensive rats were treated with simvastatin at two dose levels (5 and 10 mg/kg per day) and simvastatin in combination with valsartan or enalapril (also 5 and 10 mg/kg per day) from the age of 7 to 12 weeks. Systolic BP and bodyweight were measured weekly. 3. At the end of the experiment, following fixation by perfusion, MRA and the basilar artery were excised and embedded in Technovit (a glycol methacrylate medium; Heraeus Kulzer, Werheim, Germany). Serial sections were cut and stereological techniques used to determine tunica media width and cross-sectional area (CSA), lumen diameter and the ratio of media width/lumen diameter. 4. Simvastatin monotherapy did not lower BP at either dose. In the high- and low-dose groups, the combination of simvastatin + enalapril lowered BP more than with enalapril alone; this was also true for the simvastatin + valsartan combination in the lower-dose group. 5. The MRA were hypotrophically remodelled by the 10 mg/kg per day dose of simvastatin; the 5 mg/kg per day dose caused hypotrophic remodelling with decreased media/lumen ratio. Valsartan and enalapril caused hypotrophic remodelling together with outward remodelling of the lumen in the 10 mg/kg per day valsartan group and, in all groups, a reduction in the media/lumen ratio, with the greatest effect observed in the high-dose groups. 6. The combination treatments of simvastatin + valsartan and simvastatin + enalapril did not have any consistent extra effect on MRA remodelling. 7. In the basilar artery, high-dose simvastatin had a hypotrophic effect on the media and both doses reduced the media/lumen ratio independently of any change in BP. 8. Simvastatin given in combination with valsartan produced a slight further reduction in medial CSA, media width and ratio. In combination with enalapril, there was little consistent additional effect. 9. Simvastatin monotherapy hypotrophically remodelled the media of the basilar artery in the GH rat model, even in the absence of changes in BP. A similar structural effect may explain, in part, the reduction in stroke seen in patients treated with statins.",

    "472": "The metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes mellitus result in macrovascular and microvascular complications in multiple organ systems; it is the cardiovascular impact that accounts for the greatest morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Heart failure, both with reduced and preserved systolic function, is a major complication, arising from the frequent associations with coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, and a specific heart muscle dysfunction (cardiomyopathy) that occurs independently of coronary artery disease. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension, together with activation of both circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, contribute to structural fibrosis and autonomic neuropathy. Thus it becomes imperative to identify cardiac abnormalities early in the course of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in order to allow early and aggressive intervention to control glucose and blood pressure and to normalize blood lipid profiles. Patients with diabetes should be treated to secondary prevention targets, including blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg and LDL less than 100 mg/dL. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, certain calcium channel blockers, statins, and aspirin have all been demonstrated to significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes.", 
    "473": "There is a small body of literature on the interactions between lithium and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), but little data documenting the differences between these agents in their impact on serum lithium levels. We present the case of a 46-year-old male who sustained a five-fold increase in his serum lithium level after switching from fosinopril to lisinopril, with a peak serum lithium level of 3.4 meq/l. There was also an increase in serum creatinine from 1.1 on fosinopril to 1.4 after switching to lisinopril. The patient was hospitalized, and intravenously hydrated with 0.5 normal saline, with a reduction of the serum lithium level to 0.7 meq/l by 72 h after admission. The hospital course was marked by two episodes of bradycardia, but was otherwise uneventful, and the patient was discharged without any neurological sequelae. This case demonstrates that ACEIs may have differential effects on renal function, and the potential for significant alterations in lithium clearance that may not be clinically evident for several weeks. Lithium-treated patients who have a change in ACEI, especially those who are older or have below average renal function, must have diligent monitoring for the first 4-6 weeks after switching to detect potentially serious changes in serum lithium levels.", 
    "474": "Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), a mitogenic factor for renal cells, is overexpressed in acute renal failure (ARF). Recent data support an association between PTHrP and the renin-angiotensin system in the damaged kidney. The effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) inhibitors (quinapril, enalapril, and/or losartan) on PTHrP and the PTH1 receptor (PTH1R) expression in rats with either folic acid (FA)- or gentamicin-induced ARF were analyzed. The decreased renal function and the PTHrP upregulation and PTH1R downregulation induced by the nephrotoxins were inhibited by the Ang II blockers. In tubuloepithelial cells NRK-52E, the rapid (10 min) increase in PTHrP mRNA by FA, associated with a perinuclear relocalization of Ang II/AT1 receptor, was inhibited by losartan but not candesartan, which traps Ang II receptors at the cell surface. Maximal PTHrP protein overexpression by FA (at 24 to 72 h)-or by exogenous Ang II-was abolished by both Ang II antagonists. PTHrP upregulation by FA was preceded by increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and inhibited by the ERK inhibitor PD098059. FA also activated cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein, and this was prevented by losartan in these cells. Moreover, PTHrP mRNA overexpression by either FA or Ang II occurred in NRK 52E that were transfected with a CREB construct but not the dominant-negative CREB133 construct. These findings demonstrate that the decreased renal function and PTHrP overexpression in nephrotoxin-damaged kidney depends on renin-angiotensin system. In this setting, intracellular Ang II/AT1 receptor recycling seems to be related to PTHrP induction through ERK and CREB activation in tubuloepithelial cells.", 
    "475": "The potential and possible mechanisms for regression of existing glomerulosclerosis by angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1RA) and/or angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) were investigated. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). Glomerulosclerosis was assessed by renal biopsy 8 wk later, and rats were divided into groups with equal biopsy sclerosis and treated for the next 4 wk until they were killed at 12 wk as follows: Control with no further treatment (CONT), high-dose AT1RA, high-dose ACEI, and varying AT1RA+ACEI combinations. Hypertension and proteinuria induced by 5/6 Nx were significantly decreased by all treatments, except high-dose ACEI, which showed persistent proteinuria. High-dose AT1RA and ACEI markedly decreased progression of sclerosis, with -2.3% average decrease in sclerosis from biopsy to autopsy in AT1RA versus 194% increase in CONT (P < 0.0001). Glomerulosclerosis regressed, with less severe lesions at the time when the rats were killed than at biopsy in 62% of AT1RA-treated and 57% of ACEI-treated rats. In contrast, only 17 to 33% of rats in combination groups had regression. Alternatively, these data might be viewed as reflecting halting of progression, as some groups had higher BP and proteinuria. However, this potential confounding effect does not negate the effects to achieve regression of sclerosis in these rats. Regression was not explained by changes in mRNA of TGF-beta1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 but was linked to decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. It is concluded that angiotensin inhibition mediates regression in part by effects on matrix modulation.",

In Ren-2 rats, the growing vasculature extended farther into the retinal periphery than in SD rats and was unchanged with either lisinopril or losartan.

We retrospectively studied 267 hypertensive patients receiving chronic ACEI/ARA therapy undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia. During preoperative visits, patients were asked to either take their last ACEI/ARA therapy on the morning of surgery or withhold it up to 24 h before surgery. The number of hours from the last ACEI/ARA dose to surgery was recorded during the preoperative interview. Electronic medical and anesthesia records were reviewed for comorbidities, type and dose of anesthetics used, intraoperative hemodynamics, IV fluids, perioperative vasopressor administration, and rate of severe postoperative complications. Arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were recorded during the 60-min postinduction period, and hypotension was classified as moderate (systolic BP <or=85 mm Hg) and severe (systolic BP <or=65 mm Hg). We analyzed all variables separately for patients who took their last ACEI/ARA therapy <10 h and >or=10 h before surgery. During the first 30 min after anesthetic induction, moderate hypotension was more frequent in patients whose most recent ACEI/ARA therapy was taken <10 h (60%) compared with those who stopped it >or=10 h (46%) before induction (P = 0.02). The adjusted odds ratio for moderate hypotension was 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.93) for those who took their ACEI/ARA therapy <10 h before surgery (P = 0.04). There were no differences between groups in the incidence of severe hypotension, nor was there a difference in the use of vasopressors. During the 31-60 min after induction, the incidence of either moderate (P = 0.43) or severe (P = 0.97) hypotension was similar in the two groups. No differences in postoperative complications were found between groups. In conclusion, discontinuation of ACEI/ARA therapy at least 10 h before anesthesia was associated with a reduced risk of immediate postinduction hypotension.",

By failing to control blood pressures equally across study drug groups, ALLHAT cannot be considered to be a definitive comparative trial. Being neither a monotherapy trial nor a trial that initiated therapy for blood pressure control, ALLHAT provided no data to recommend first-line therapy for hypertension, making the conclusions invalid. Thiazide-type diuretics increase angiotensin II and consequently promote atherosclerosis and arteriolarsclerosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers retard atherosclerosis and are nephroprotective. Multiple randomized controlled trials show beneficial clinical outcomes, including cardioprotection and nephroprotection, with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. These agents, and not thiazide-type diuretics, should be used as first-line agents to retard the process of atherosclerosis and its clinical outcomes in the setting of arterial hypertension.",

This review will outline the proven and unproven strategies that have the potential to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recently, a number of randomised clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several strategies to slow the progression of CKD. Proven strategies include adequate blood pressure control (with angiotensin blockade), and for diabetic nephropathy good glycaemic control. Other potentially beneficial strategies include smoking cessation, lipid control and aldosterone blockade. The early institution of these strategies has the potential to regress established CKD as well as improve the long-term cardiovascular outcomes of these patients. Proof of the efficacy in humans of promising experimental approaches, such as the administration of growth factors (e.g., recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-7), anti-fibrotic agents (e.g., pirfenidone) and novel anti-proteinuric drugs (e.g., pentosan polysulphate), is awaited. Finally, the primary prevention of CKD, at least in part, by the eradication of type 2 diabetes and obesity (through improvement of lifestyle factors), and adequate treatment of hypertension, have the potential to eliminate up to half of the most common causes of CKD (or ESRD) in developed countries.", 
    "496": "High blood pressure plays a key role in the progression of renal failure. Hypertension is a common presentation of kidney disease and an almost invariable accompaniment of renal failure. Hypertension is also a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, the major cause of morbidity and mortality in renal failure. Hypertension is both cause and consequence of renal failure, but the precise nature and prevalence of hypertensive nephrosclerosis as a cause of renal failure remains controversial. There is strong evidence that hypertension accelerates the progression of experimental renal disease and that control of blood pressure is effective in preventing this progression. Hypertension, both accelerated and \"benign\" (a misnomer), has long been recognised as a poor prognostic feature in human renal disease and more recently in renal allograft survival. Blood pressure control is very effective in retarding renal disease progression. There are compelling indications for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in both non-diabetic and type 1 diabetic nephropathies, and for angiotensin receptor blockers in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Most patients will require combination drug therapy to control blood pressure and reduce both progression of renal failure and the associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "497": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic microenvironment and a major contributor to the adverse ventricular remodelling that follows myocardial infarction (MI), via activation of both direct pro-fibrotic pathways and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that enhance collagenase activity. Reactive fibrosis, i.e. deposition of ECM materials remote from the region of the MI is clearly detrimental to ventricular function and contributory to adverse outcomes post-MI. Therefore, reversal of this process represents an important therapeutic target in post-MI management and treatment of established heart failure. A number of existing agents exert their beneficial effects in part via reductions in ECM deposition. Furthermore, specific anti-fibrotic drugs have been developed and are currently being explored for these and other cardiac conditions where pathological ECM deposition is felt to be contributory to disease progression.", 
    "498": "Major advances in the diagnostic, evaluation, and particularly surgical treatment of aortic regurgitation (AR) have redefined the role of medical treatment. In acute AR, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only life-saving treatment. Medical treatment may improve the hemodynamic state temporarily before surgery. Rationale of medical treatment in chronic AR is based on the natural history and pathophysiology of the disease. The primary goal is to optimize the time of the AVR. If there is any symptom and/or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, early AVR is required. Vasodilators should only be considered as a short-term treatment before surgery if there is evidence of severe heart failure or as a long-term treatment if AVR is contraindicated because of cardiac or noncardiac factors. In asymptomatic patients with severe chronic AR and normal LV function (even if the left ventricle is moderately dilated), vasodilators may prolong the compensated phase of chronic AR, although proof of their efficacy in delaying AVR is limited. Nifedipine is the best evidence-based treatment in this indication. ACE inhibitors are particularly useful for hypertensive patients with AR. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) may be indicated to slow the rate of aortic dilatation and delay the need for surgery in patients with AR associated with aortic root disease. Furthermore, they may improve cardiac performance by reducing cardiac volume and LV mass in patients with impaired LV function after AVR for AR.",

    "503": "In the United States, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer accounting for about 1 million fatalities annually, with hypertension being a major risk factor for stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular (CV) death, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease--all of which have higher prevalence in African Americans, who also experience greater severity at clinical presentation. In numerous randomized trials and meta-analyses, drug therapy for hypertension has been shown to reduce blood pressure by 4-6 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) with resultant decreases in stroke of 35%-40%, CHD of 20%-25%, and CV death of about 25%. Cardiovascular drug therapies of proven benefit, including diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors), and beta-blockers, are safe and effective, alone and in combination. Since African Americans with hypertension tend to have a more severe presentation, they will be even more likely to require multiple drug therapies, which also will include diuretics and calcium channel blockers. Effective strategies to encourage widespread use of these therapies of proven benefit would provide progress toward decreasing the adverse mortality experiences, especially CVD, among African Americans.", 
    "504": "Diabetic nephropathy is the number one cause of endstage renal disease in the United States. Blood pressure is most important in delaying the progression of renal disease in persons with diabetes and, agents that block the renin angiotensin system (RAS) should be the primary agents used to achieve blood pressure reduction. There is debate regarding which method of RAS blockade should be used as primary therapy in persons with diabetes. There are not significant differences between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with regard to renal outcomes. Consideration of the enormously high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in persons with diabetes and renal disease is the primary factor in choosing agents for blood pressure reduction. The ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in persons with diabetes and, there are recent comparable trials between the 2 classes. Some studies and meta-analyses show ACE inhibitors as being superior with regard to cardioprotection. In our nephrology clinic, we find that patients who presented on an ACE inhibitor had significantly lower CVD than those on ARBs (49.2% vs 70.1% prevalence of CVD, ACE inhibitor vs ARB respectively, P=.042). We conclude that ACE inhibitors should be strongly considered as the primary method of RAS inhibition in persons with diabetes.",

    "510": "Structural alterations of subcutaneous small resistance arteries are associated with a worse clinical prognosis in hypertension and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). However, no data are presently available about the effects of antihypertensive therapy on vascular structure in hypertensive patients with NIDDM. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and a highly selective angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, on indices of subcutaneous small resistance artery structure in 15 patients with mild hypertension and NIDDM. Eight patients were treated with candesartan (8 to 16 mg per day) and 7 with enalapril (10 to 20 mg per day) for 1 year. Each patient underwent a biopsy of the subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. Small arteries were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph and the media-to-internal lumen ratio was evaluated; moreover, endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine was assessed. A similar blood pressure-lowering effect and a similar reduction of the media-to-lumen ratio of small arteries was observed with the 2 drugs. Vascular collagen content was reduced and metalloproteinase-9 was increased by candesartan, but not by enalapril. Changes of circulating indices of collagen turnover and circulating matrix metalloproteinase paralleled those of vascular collagen. The 2 drugs equally improved endothelial function. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment with drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity is able to correct, at least in part, alterations in small resistance artery structure in hypertensive patients with NIDDM. Candesartan may be more effective than enalapril in reducing collagen content in the vasculature.", 
    "511": "The present study explored the possibility that estrogen enhances the inhibitory effect of an angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan, on atherosclerosis, focusing on oxidative stress using apolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoEKO). After 6 weeks on a high-cholesterol diet, marked atherosclerotic lesion formation with an increase in oxidative stress, such as superoxide production, NAD(P)H oxidase activity and expression of p47phox mRNA and rac-1 mRNA, were observed in the proximal aorta in both male and female ApoEKO mice, whereas these changes were less marked in female mice. Ovariectomy enhanced these parameters, the changes of which were reversed by 17beta-estradiol (80 microg/kg per day) replacement. Treatment with olmesartan (3 mg/kg per day) significantly inhibited oxidative stress and atherosclerosis, whereas its inhibitory effects were more marked in female than in male or ovariectomized mice. Smaller doses of olmesartan (0.5 mg/kg per day) or 17beta-estradiol (20 microg/kg per day) did not influence atherosclerosis and oxidative stress in ovariectomized mice, whereas co-administration of olmesartan and 17beta-estradiol at these doses attenuated these parameters. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocapril, also inhibited atherosclerotic changes similarly to olmesartan. Moreover, angiotensin II-mediated activation of NAD(P)H oxidase in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells was attenuated by 17beta-estradiol. These results indicate that estrogen and an ARB synergistically attenuate atherosclerosis at least partly via inhibition of oxidative stress.", 
    "512": "The effects of combination anti-angiogenesis therapy (marimastat, captopril and fragmin) on plasma levels of coagulation initiator tissue factor (TF), platelet marker soluble P-selectin and angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were tested in 25 patients with advanced cancer.

Soluble P-selectin, TF and VEGF did not change at 4- and 8-weeks whilst on treatment. We provide further evidence linking coagulation and angiogenesis but combination anti-angiogenesis therapy does not influence plasma soluble P-selectin, TF or VEGF.", 
    "513": "Perindopril is a long-acting, once-daily lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme affinity, lowering angiotensin II and potentiating bradykinin. Its efficacy, safety and tolerability are well established in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Moreover, large morbidity-mortality trials, such as the EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) and Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), have shown that antihypertensive treatment with perindopril reduces and prevents cardiovascular disease in a large range of patients with vascular diseases, whether hypertensive or not. Thus, the outcome of these and other trials support the concept of cardiovascular protective properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with perindopril in addition to the obvious blood-pressure-lowering effect. Considering its properties and the gathered clinical evidence on efficacy and tolerability, perindopril fulfils the criteria of the latest guidelines for hypertension and cardiovascular disease management and should therefore be considered as a first-line antihypertensive agent, forming a consistent part of the comprehensive strategy against hypertension and related cardiovascular complications.", 
    "514": "Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) have been identified in the human cardiovascular tissues. We determined MR expression in the failing heart to clarify the mechanism of action of aldosterone antagonist in the treatment of congestive heart failure. MR protein and MR mRNA content were detected by immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization in the cardiac tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of the receptor, as well as in situ hybridization of MR mRNA, was dense in cardiomyocytes of the failing left ventricle as compared with the controls. The staining ratio of the cytoplasm to the interstitium showed that MRs were located mainly in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm to the interstitium in the failing left ventricle was 1.53+/-0.13, which was significantly higher than that of the controls 1.25+/-0.19 (p<0.05). These findings suggest that the efficacy of aldosterone antagonists in treating congestive heart failure may be in part through blocking the MRs, which are upregulated in the failing heart.", 
    "515": "There is increasing evidence that combination therapy should be emphasized more than it is at present for the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. Recent guidelines acknowledge the value of combination therapy, although some treatment algorithms fail to echo this message. Observations from major clinical trials in the elderly, diabetics, stroke patients, and African Americans all indicate that combination therapy is necessary to control blood pressure in the majority of these patients. Several combination therapies such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a diuretic, a beta blocker with a diuretic, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a calcium antagonist have been shown to be effective in patients who do not respond to monotherapy. The current review focuses on the newest such combination; an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a diuretic may have an added advantage of being well tolerated. Recent studies have shown that angiotensin II receptor blockers, given alone or combined with a diuretic, may prevent some cardiovascular outcomes independent of their blood pressure-lowering efficacy.",

Furthermore, the recent pharmaceutical developments for the promotion of NO production and the problems associated with NO inhibitors will also be discussed. During the next few years it will become apparent whether manipulation of NO has multiple therapeutic applications or whether the diversity of effects renders intervention too non-specific.", 
    "517": "The spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHR-SP) is an experimental model of malignant hypertension which lead to secondary alterations of the extracellular matrix. Our aim was to determine ACE-inhibitor related changes of proteases involved in the reconstruction of the extracellular matrix in the brain. Twelve SHR-SP rats were randomized into two groups. Each group was treated with either an antihypertensive dose of ramipril or placebo for 6 months. Brain tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase (u-PA) were quantified by using casein-dependent plasminogen zymography, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, by MMP-zymography, and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and -2, by reverse zymography. The amounts of u-PA, t-PA, and MMPs were significantly reduced in animals treated with ACE inhibitor. Plasminogen zymography showed a 39% reduction of u-PA in the basal ganglia (p < 0.0001); t-PA expression was reduced by 26% in the cortex and by 33% in the basal ganglia (p < 0.0001). MMP-2 expression was reduced by 15% in the cortex (p < 0.05) and by 10% in the basal ganglia (p < 0.05); MMP-9 expression significantly decreased by 37% in the cortex and by 25% in the basal ganglia (p < 0.0001 each). No differences were observed in the amount of TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. These findings provide new insights into the biochemical mechanisms underlying extracellular matrix proliferation and its modulation by ACE inhibitors. Therapeutic alterations that influence the proteolytic systems might prove important in the prevention of extracellular matrix accumulation and secondary microvascular vessel wall changes.", 
    "518": "The objectives were to determine the effects of alacepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on the expression of adhesion molecules and monocyte adherence to endothelial cells induced by 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. We used human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and U937 monocytic cells. Surface expression and mRNA levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) were determined by EIA and RT-PCR. Adherence of U937 to HAECs was assessed by adhesion assay. Incubation of HAEC with 7-KC increased the surface expression of protein and mRNA levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on HAECs and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HAECs. Pretreatment with alacepril reduced the enhanced expression of these molecules in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of alacepril against 7-KC or TNF-alpha-induced CAMs expression was stronger than that of captopril or enalapril. Alacepril inhibited the production of ROS in HAECs stimulated by 7-KC or TNF-alpha. These results suggest that alacepril works as anti-atherogenic agent through inhibiting endothelial-dependent adhesive interactions with monocytes induced by 7-KC and TNF-alpha.", 
    "519": "Drugs, which interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, have been available to clinicians for more than 20 years. They are now recognized as a very effective approach to treat patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetic and non-diabetic chronic renal failure or patients with a high cardiovascular risk. The recent development of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist has enabled to improve significantly the tolerability profile of this group of drugs while maintaining a high clinical efficacy. Yet, with the availability of Ang II receptor antagonists, new questions have arisen. Is it still possible to gain in efficacy with newer agents? What is the future of drugs such as neutral endopeptidase (NEP)/ACE inhibitors or renin inhibitors? The first objective of this review is to discuss the clinical implications of several large clinical trials that have been published recently with ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists such as ALLHAT, LIFE, OPTIMAAL, Val-Heft, SCOPE, and more recently, CHARM, VALIANT and VALUE. With these trials, we can now define more precisely the role of these blockers of the renin-angiotensin system in the management of patients with cardiovascular complications. The second part of this review is devoted to new drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system. We discuss the recent results obtained with NEP/ACE inhibitors also named vasopeptidase inhibitors. Several compounds were or are in development but the experience with omapatrilat has blunted the enthusiasms for these compounds. Yet, vasopeptidase inhibitors remain very effective antihypertensive drugs and there is a great therapeutic potential for these agents provided one can define more accurately the risk/benefit ratio and the clinical indications. Finally, we present the recent data obtained with SPP 100, a new renin inhibitor that is actually under clinical development. SPP 100 has a sufficient bioavailability to induce a sustained blockade of the renin-angiotensin system when given orally to normal subjects. Recent studies have shown that SPP 100 lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients as effectively as an Ang II receptor antagonist.", 
    "520": "Rates of end-stage renal disease among Australian Aboriginal people have been increasing over the past 2 decades, particularly in the northern and more remote areas of Australia, and especially in disadvantaged communities. Proteinuria predicts the rate of loss of kidney function; it is common in young adults and virtually universal in those over 50 years of age. Cumulative independent risk factors include low birth weight, recurrent skin infections, adult obesity, diabetes or its precursors, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and a family history of renal disease. A plausible theory is that intrauterine malnutrition permanently reduces total nephron numbers, which are then overworked in adulthood by the metabolic stresses of obesity (from excess alcohol and poor diet), by higher blood pressures, and by infections, while starved of blood supply because of smoking. Although kidney disease is often only detected when already well established, active medical intervention offers great rewards. Control of blood pressure (preferentially using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (AIIRBs) in combination) can often stop or even reverse kidney damage, even if ongoing diabetes control is poor. Adequately funded kidney health programs with active Aboriginal health worker involvement are enormously cost-effective: tight blood pressure control at least halves the rate of disease progression, and every year of dialysis deferred for 1 patient could fund the appointment of 2 health workers. Addressing the underlying social causes for this epidemic is critical.", 
    "521": "The objective of the study was to assess, from a health service perspective, whether a systematic program to modify kidney and cardiovascular disease reduced the costs of treating end-stage kidney failure. The participants in the study were 1,800 aboriginal adults with hypertension, diabetes with microalbuminuria or overt albuminuria, and overt albuminuria, living on two islands in the Northern Territory of Australia during 1995 to 2000. Perindopril was the primary treatment agent, and other medications were also used to control blood pressure. Control of glucose and lipid levels were attempted, and health education was offered. Evaluation of program resource use and costs for follow-up periods was done at 3 and 4.7 years. On an intention-to-treat basis, the number of dialysis starts and dialysis-years avoided were estimated by comparing the fate of the treatment group with that of historical control subjects, matched for disease severity, who were followed in the before the treatment program began. For the first three years, an estimated 11.6 person-years of dialysis were avoided, and over 4.7 years, 27.7 person-years of dialysis were avoided. The net cost of the program was 1,210 dollars more per person per year than status quo care, and dialyses avoided gave net savings of 1.0 million dollars at 3 years and 3.4 million dollars at 4.6 years. The treatment program provided significant health benefit and impressive cost savings in dialysis avoided.", 
    "522": "Pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts (FBPA) may play a central role in lung vascular remodeling under conditions of hypoxia and inflammation, the result being pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. In cultured human FBPA, both angiotensin II (Ang II) and hypoxia promoted cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. These effects were further enhanced when both stimuli were applied simultaneously. Hypoxia elevated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and increased the expression of genes regulated by the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE). Up-regulation of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1) was also observed. Exogenous Ang II further increased HIF/HRE-dependent signaling in FBPA, whereas suppression of the autocrine ACE-Ang II-AT1 loop with inhibitors of ACE, AT1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) reduced the proliferative response to both hypoxia and exogenous Ang II. Overexpression of HIF-1alpha by transient transfection caused the same proliferative effect and up-regulation of AT1 expression that were observed under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, small interfering RNA targeting HIF-1alpha inhibited hypoxia-induced ACE and AT1 expression. Our studies indicate that the ACE-Ang II-AT1 system serves as a positive feedback loop and fosters FBPA proliferation under hypoxic conditions, with the PI3K-HIF-HRE axis as the central effector pathway. This pathway may thus facilitate vascular remodeling under hypoxic conditions.",

Clinical improvement was reflected in reductions in patients with NYHA functional classes III and IV (93 (40%) to 53 (23%)), and in patients with moderate or severe symptoms.

Overall, there are 200,000 patients with heart failure in The Netherlands and around 25,000 hospitalisations annually with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure. Most of these patients are managed in primary care, often together with a cardiologist. There is an active guideline program in different professional organisations (e.g. general practitioners, cardiologists) and in 2002 a collaborative multidisciplinary guideline for management of chronic heart failure was developed. However, there is clearly room for improvement in the adherence to these guidelines both with regard to the diagnosis and the treatment of HF patients. For example, ACE-I and beta-blockers are still under-prescribed. In particular, the more severely ill patients seem to be under treated. At present, general practitioners and cardiologists differ in their views on heart failure, resulting in differences in diagnosis and management. In addition to the multidisciplinary guidelines, several other initiatives have been developed to improve outcomes in these patients, such as rapid access clinics and outpatient heart failure clinics.", 
    "533": "This article examines the emerging role of the heart failure nurse and the responsibilities and educational and training requirements surrounding such a role. There may be variations in the role and its responsibilities in different health care settings. However the principles are similar and include: history taking, carrying out clinical assessment and making appropriate decisions about patient management within the context of practice. An example of this is nurse supervision of adjusting and titration of medication in a clinic setting or in the patient's own home. A major challenge to this role is defining the limitations and scope of practice. Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are generally a frail, elderly population, and often have significant other co-morbidities. They can be on multiple medications and are frequently prescribed sub-optimal doses of evidence-based medication. Many patients are not managed by specialists, thus creating a huge potential for improved management.", 
    "534": "Advanced heart failure has been defined as persistent symptoms (NYHA class III-IV) that limit daily life despite routine therapy with agents of known benefit. Although these symptoms can occur both with low and preserved ejection fraction, the majority of reported experience is with low ejection fraction, usually <25%. For this population with expected one year mortality of 30-50%, over twice the mortality of the landmark trials of medical therapy, there is little trial data to guide management, which is based largely on collected experience. Once the disease has progressed to this stage, therapy focuses upon the twin goals of symptom relief and prolongation of survival and is guided according to the hemodynamic profiles defined by clinical assessment. As symptoms at this stage relate largely to the congestion, therapy is targeted to reduction of elevated pulmonary venous and/or systemic venous pressures to near normal levels. The most common obstacle to relief of congestion is the increasingly recognized cardio-renal syndrome, for which both understanding and therapy are currently limited. Design of the outpatient regimen for advanced heart failure must be tailored to the individual patient. Many patients with advanced heart failure cannot tolerate \"target\" doses of neurohormonal antagonists, and spironolactone should be used only when clinical and renal function are sufficiently stable and frequently monitored in order to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. The clinical benefit of bi-ventricular pacing is substantial for the small proportion of patients likely to benefit. The vast majority of patients will never be eligible for cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist devices. To derive maximal benefit from all available therapies, heart failure disease management with collaboration of physicians and specialized nurses offers the greatest benefit to the greatest number of patients with advanced heart failure.",

Plasmatic creatinine did not change (1.9+/-0.5 baseline versus 1.9+/-0.6 mg/dL), but creatinine clearance increased at the end visit (41.8+/-16.0 baseline versus 45.8+/-18.0 mL/min, p=0.019). Plasmatic cholesterol also decreased from 221+/-46 to 211+/-35 mg/dL (p=0.001).",

    "544": "We investigated the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker on cardiac hypertrophy in rats with renovascular hypertension. Renovascular hypertensive (Goldblatt) rats were surgically prepared from Wistar rats. Four weeks later, the rats showed a significant increase in blood pressure. At high doses, both the perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) and the candesartan (2 mg/kg/day) decreased the systolic pressure in these rats to the level of control Wistar rats. At low doses (perindopril 0.1 mg/kg/day and candesartan 0.1 mg/kg/day), these drugs lowered blood pressure to 85% of that in hypertensive rats. Echocardiographic and morphological studies revealed severe cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in untreated Goldblatt rats. High-dose treatment with both drugs suppressed the progression of hypertrophy and fibrosis. Also, low-dose perindopril prevented cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. In contrast, at the same levels of blood-pressure reduction, low-dose candesartan did not prevent cardiac fibrosis nor the upregulation of cardiac collagen types I and III mRNA observed in untreated Goldblatt rats. Atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA was up-regulated in untreated Goldblatt rats. These changes were significantly decreased by both doses of perindopril or the high dose of candesartan. Serum levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone were significantly higher in untreated Goldblatt rats. Both doses of perindopril inhibited activation of the renin-angiotensin system, whereas candesartan had weaker effects. In particular, serum aldosterone was 347 +/- 20 pg/ml in low-dose perindopril versus 1796 +/- 324 pg/ml in low-dose candesartan. These results suggest that there were no differences between the cardioprotective actions of perindopril and candesartan at high dosages. On the other hand, low-dose treatment with perindopril was more effective in preventing cardiac fibrosis than was low-dose treatment with candesartan, despite similar changes in blood pressure. It is possible that changes in aldosterone secretion are related to this difference.", 
    "545": "To verify the benefit of renin-angiotensin system blockade in hypertension, the effects of 24 weeks' losartan and ramipril treatment, both alone and in combination, on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and circulating transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta1) have been evaluated in hypertensive subjects with minor renal abnormalities.", 
    "546": "Fifty-one patients with stage 1 and 2 essential hypertension and with UAE > or = 20 mg/24 h but with maintained renal function have been included. After a 4-week run-in with placebo administration, a randomized double-blind, three-arm double-dummy trial was used. All the hypertensives (HT) were allocated randomly to three treatment arms (17 patients for each group) and they were single-matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Active treatment consisted of losartan (50 mg/day), ramipril (5 mg/day) and combined (losartan 50 mg/day plus ramipril 5 mg/day) for 24 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day was added in HT patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (> or = 140/90 mmHg) during the active treatment period. In all patients UAE, by immunonephelometric assay; circulating TGF beta1 by a solid-phase specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and creatinine clearance and potassium, by routine laboratory methods, were determined after placebo treatment and 24 weeks follow-up.", 
    "547": "The three treatment groups were comparable for gender, age, BMI, blood pressure, UAE and renal function measurements. During the active treatment period it was necessary to add hydrochlorothiazide in five patients--two each of the losartan and ramipril groups and one of the combined group. At the end of treatment, significant (P < 0.05) reductions in systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, UAE and TGF beta1 levels were observed in all the groups. No change in renal function measurements were observed. The absolute and percentage reduction in UAE and TGF beta1 were significantly higher in the combined group than in the losartan or ramipril groups. No significant changes in absolute and percentage reduction of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure were found. All treatment regimens were well tolerated with few and transient side-effects.", 
    "548": "These data indicate an additional renoprotective effect of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in hypertensive patients with minor renal abnormalities. In addition, the contemporaneus and marked decrease in TGF beta1 and UAE levels in hypertensives treated with combined therapy might indicate the presence of a subset of subjects who may benefit from complete RAS blockade.", 
    "549": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provide effective intervention for cardiovascular and renal disease. Changes in angiotensin-(1-7) have been proposed to be involved in the mechanism of action of ACE inhibition (ACEi). In particular, an altered balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) might be involved. A shift in sodium status modifies the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the effects of ACEi, but its effects on angiotensin-(1-7) are unknown. We therefore studied the effect of a shift in sodium intake on angiotensin-(1-7), during placebo and ACEi.", 
    "550": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 17 healthy men. The subjects were studied for two 2-week periods: 20 mg/day enalapril and placebo. The first week of each period they used a 50 mmol Na+ diet [low sodium (LS)], the second week a 200 mmol Na+ diet. Angiotensin levels and blood pressure were measured at the end of each week.", 
    "551": "During placebo, LS intake elicited a three-fold rise in ang-(1-7) that paralleled the rise in other components of the renin-angiotensin system. During ACEi LS did not affect angiotensin II, but did induce a clear-cut rise in angiotensin-(1-7)--to the extent that angiotensin-(1-7) was highest during combination of ACEi and LS. Consequently, during ACEi LS shifted the balance between angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin II towards angiotensin-(1-7).", 
    "552": "The sodium status modifies levels of angiotensin-(1-7). During ACEi angiotensin-(1-7) is still subject to stimulation by sodium restriction, and provides opportunity for therapeutic manipulation. Exploration of this opportunity in patient populations may lead to strategies to improve therapeutic benefits of ACEi.", 
    "553": "The substantial benefits of ramipril over conventional therapy in high-risk patients are not always associated with clinically significant differences in brachial arterial pressure, and largely remain unexplained. We undertook this acute study to establish the magnitude of and reason for different acute effects of ramipril and atenolol on arterial pressure.", 
    "554": "We enrolled 30 patients, who took 10 mg ramipril, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo at intervals of > or = 7 days, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After baseline, measurements were taken at 30-60 min intervals for 5 h, and comprised cuff brachial pressure, radial artery tonometry with generation of central aortic pressure, and pulse wave velocity for aorta, upper limb and lower limb arteries.", 
    "555": "Both ramipril and atenolol reduced arterial pressure, and the diastolic pressure fall was similar in the aorta and brachial artery, but the systolic pressure fall for ramipril was greater than for atenolol (by 5.2 mmHg, P < 0.0001) in the aorta compared with the brachial artery. The aortic systolic pressure difference with ramipril in comparison with atenolol was accompanied by an absolute difference of 10.7% (P < 0.0001) in the augmentation index, denoting a reduction in peripheral wave reflection by ramipril. The aortic pulse wave velocity fell to a similar degree with ramipril in comparison with atenolol, but fell to a greater degree (1.35 and 0.44 m/s, respectively, P < 0.0001 for both) in muscular arteries of the lower and upper limbs.", 
    "556": "A greater (average, 5.2 mmHg) decrease in aortic systolic pressure caused by ramipril may explain the greater benefit of ramipril over atenolol. The difference is attributable to decreased stiffness of peripheral arteries and a reduction in wave reflection.", 
    "557": "Recent trials have suggested that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), may reduce the incidence of new-onset diabetes in patients with or without hypertension and at high risk of developing diabetes. In this review, we critically evaluate the evidence from recent clinical trials for such a potential preventive effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, including a meta-analysis of these recent trials. The reduced incidence of diabetes in patients at high risk of developing diabetes by ACE inhibitors or ARBs has been explained by haemodynamic effects, such as improved delivery of insulin and glucose to the peripheral skeletal muscle, and non-haemodynamic effects, including direct effects on glucose transport and insulin signalling pathways, all of which decrease insulin resistance. There is now evidence that the pancreas may contain an in situ active RAS, which appears to be upregulated in an animal model of type 2 diabetes. Thus, ACE inhibitors and ARBs may act by attenuating the deleterious effect of angiotensin II on vasoconstriction, fibrosis, inflammation, apoptosis and beta-cell death in the pancreas, thereby protecting a critical beta-cell mass essential for insulin production. New evidence is presented that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may delay or prevent the development of insulin resistance and diabetes, for which novel mechanisms are suggested. The actions of agents that interrupt the RAS on insulin resistance, obesity and diabetes warrant further investigation in other animal models. Prospective clinical studies with the primary endpoint of the prevention of diabetes are now indicated to (i) further explore whether the inhibitors of the RAS are superior compared to other antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and (ii) to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of combination antihypertensive regimens on the development of diabetes.", 
    "558": "Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the most common primary glomerular diseases to terminate in ESRD. A complete remission (CR) confers an excellent long-term prognosis, but the quantitative benefits of partial remissions (PR) have not been defined. This study evaluated the rate of renal function decline (slope of creatinine clearance) and renal survival in nephrotic FSGS patients with CR, PR, or no remission. It also examined relapse rate from remission and its impact on outcome. Multivariate analysis included clinical and laboratory data at presentation and over follow-up, BP control, the agents used, and immunosuppressive therapy. The study cohort was 281 nephrotic FSGS patients who had a minimum of 12 mo of observation and were identified from the Toronto Glomerulonephritis Registry. Over a median follow-up of 65 mo, 55 experienced a CR, 117 had a PR, and 109 had no remission. A PR was independently predictive of slope and survival from renal failure by multivariate analysis (adjusted time-dependent hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.96; P = 0.04). Immunosuppression with high-dose prednisone was associated with a higher rate of PR and CR. Relapse from PR was frequent (56%) and associated with a more rapid rate of renal function decline and worse renal survival compared with relapse-free partial remitters. Only female gender and the nadir of proteinuria during remission were associated with a sustained remission. A PR in proteinuria and its maintenance are important therapeutic targets in FSGS, with implications for both slowing progression rate and improving renal survival.",

Our main findings were: (i) patients with acute HF had increased sCD40L levels, particularly those with severe HF, diabetes, or hypertension; (ii) when these patients were followed longitudinally, persistently raised sCD40L levels were found throughout the observation period with no effect of captopril or losartan; (iii) the increase in sCD40L during follow-up was not seen in patients receiving warfarin therapy; (iv) patients with chronic HF also had raised sCD40L, significantly correlated with clinical severity, neurohormonal dysregulation, and left ventricular dysfunction; (v) studies from different blood compartments suggest that the vasculature of lower extremities and the failing myocardium itself may produce and secrete sCD40L in chronic HF.",

We have studied the relationship between apoptosis and autophagic cell death in cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) undergoing apoptosis following serum and potassium deprivation. We found that apoptosis is accompanied by an early and marked proliferation of autophagosomal-lysosomal compartments as detected by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis. Autophagy is blocked by hrIGF-1 and forskolin, two well-known inhibitors of CGC apoptosis, as well as by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Bcl-2. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) an inhibitor of autophagy, not only arrests this event but it also blocks apoptosis. The neuroprotective effect of 3-MA is accompanied by block of cytochrome c (cyt c) release in the cytosol and by inhibition of caspase-3 activation which, in turn, appears to be mediated by cathepsin B, as CA074-Me, a selective inhibitor of this enzyme, fully blocks the processing of pro-caspase-3. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that cathepsin B, normally confined inside the lysosomal-endosomal compartment, is released during apoptosis into the cytosol where this enzyme may act as an execution protease. Collectively, these observations indicate that autophagy precedes and is causally connected with the subsequent onset of programmed death.",

    "568": "Lung fibrosis is a common side effect of the chemotherapeutic agent, bleomycin. Current evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species may play a key role in the development of lung fibrosis. The present study examined the effect of mesna on bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats. Animals were divided into three groups: (1) saline control group; (2) Bleomycin group in which rats were injected with bleomycin (15 mg/kg, i.p.) three times a week for four weeks; (3) Bleomycin and mesna group, in which mesna was given to rats (180 mg/kg/day, i.p.) a week prior to bleomycin and daily during bleomycin injections for 4 weeks until the end of the treatment. Bleomycin treatment resulted in a pronounced fall in the average body weight of animals. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury and lung fibrosis was indicated by increased lung hydroxyproline content, and elevated nitric oxide synthase, myeoloperoxidase, platelet activating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in lung tissues. On the other hand, bleomycin induced a reduction in reduced glutathione concentration and angiotensin converting enzyme activity in lung tissues. Moreover, bleomycin-induced severe histological changes in lung tissues revealed as lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltration, increased collagen deposition and fibrosis. Co-administration of bleomycin and mesna reduced bleomycin-induced weight loss and attenuated lung injury as evaluated by the significant reduction in hydroxyproline content, nitric oxide synthase activity, and concentrations of myeoloperoxidase, platelet activating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in lung tissues. Furthermore, mesna ameliorated bleomycin-induced reduction in reduced glutathione concentration and angiotensin activity in lung tissues. Finally, histological evidence supported the ability of mesna to attenuate bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and consolidation. Thus, the findings of the present study provide evidence that mesna may serve as a novel target for potential therapeutic treatment of lung fibrosis.",

This benefit appears to persist in patients older than 80 years, but less than one third of older patients have adequate blood pressure control. Systolic blood pressure is the most important predictor of cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure measurement in older persons should include an evaluation for orthostatic hypotension. Low-dose thiazide diuretics remain first-line therapy for older patients. Beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are second-line medications that should be selected based on comorbidities and risk factors.", 
    "570": "In the last years, the treatment of heart failure has radically changed, as did the knowledge of this complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome. The comprehension of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the progression of this disease highlighted the central role of various neurohormonal mechanisms. Antagonism of these systems was demonstrated to be the only strategy which favorably modifies the natural history of heart failure. However, the evolution and updating of guidelines of heart failure treatment should be considered as the first step in the development of strategies aimed at extending these principles to the \"real world\" and in particular to elderly patients, who are different from patients typically enrolled in heart failure trials. In spite of the relative lack of data on the efficacy of evidence-based treatment in daily clinical practice, the recommendations of heart failure guidelines should also be applied to elderly patients. However, it has to be taken into account the specificity of elderly patients, because of the presence of frequent comorbidities, contraindications, drug intolerance, and potential pharmacologic interactions. The inappropriate prescription, dosage and follow-up in patients treated with digitalis and spironolactone may be associated with a high rate of serious adverse events. Otherwise, in spite of the large amount of evidence about their efficacy, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers are largely underprescribed. Low-starting dosages and gradual up-titration may guarantee a good tolerability and long-term efficacy of these drugs also in elderly patients. Diagnosis and treatment of diastolic heart failure remain an unsolved issue. Further researches are needed on the efficacy of treatments in this clinical setting and, in particular, to define simple and reliable diagnostic indexes in elderly patients with preserved systolic function. Finally, the development of new multidisciplinary and effective models for the management of the ever-growing number of patients with heart failure is of utmost urgency.",

We report a 5-year-old boy with selective IgA deficiency and MGN. He presented with nephrotic syndrome. Percutaneous renal needle biopsy showed diffuse global thickening on light microscopy and heavy IgG and moderate C3 deposits were found on immunofluorescence. Electron microscopy detected extensive global subepithelial deposition of electron-dense material with frequent intramembranous extension and spike formation. The pathological diagnosis was diffuse MGN stage 1. Oral prednisolone (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) were given resulting in reduction of proteinuria. The prednisolone dose was gradually tapered and discontinued after 2 months. At present the patient has been in complete remission for 10 months despite the discontinuance of prednisolone.

The present study was designed to investigate the role of Ang II in bovine oocyte nuclear maturation. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured with or without follicular cells and Ang II or saralasin (Ang II antagonist). In the absence of follicular cells, Ang II at 0, 10(-11), 10(-9) and 10(-7) M did not affect the percentage of oocytes reaching the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) stage after 7-h (41.3 +/- 4.3, 35.3 +/- 4.0, 31.3 +/- 9.7, 38.7 +/- 8.6), 12-h (31.6 +/- 7.0, 34.7 +/- 6.1, 31.7 +/- 5.3, 28.9 +/- 9.1; mean +/- S.E.M.) and 18-h (44.9 +/- 7.3, 58.4 +/- 8.4, 53.1 +/- 7.4, 44.9 +/- 7.3) of culture, respectively.

This method relies on previously published spectrophotometric determination of hippuric acid (HA) content in the urine, the method of which was based on the specific colorimetric reaction of HA with benzene sulfonyl chloride (BSC) in the presence of quinoline. The proposed ACE inhibition assay was applied to the measurement of the ACE inhibitory activity of Captopril. IC(50) value of Captopril corresponded well with literature data. Furthermore, Alcalase hydrolysates of mung bean and rice protein isolates were assessed for ACE inhibitory activity by this method. These two hydrolysates showed high ACE inhibitory activity.

The aim of our current study was to examine the combination effect of the clinically used interferon-beta (IFN) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (PE), on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine, especially in conjunction with angiogenesis. Single treatment with either IFN or PE significantly attenuated the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the combination of IFN and PE nearly abolished hepatocarcinogenesis. Both IFN and PE also significantly suppressed the neovascularization and expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, in the tumor. These inhibitory effects were similar in magnitude to their inhibitory effects against hepatocarcinogenesis. The combined treatment with IFN and PE resulted in a marked increase of apoptosis in the tumor, whereas tumor cell proliferation was not altered. These results suggested that the combination treatment with IFN and PE may be an effective new strategy for chemoprevention against HCC.",

    "605": "The plasma kinin-forming cascade can be activated by contact with negatively charged macromolecules leading to binding and autoactivation of factor XII, activation of prekallikrein to kallikrein by factor XIIa, and cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen (HK) by kallikrein to release the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. Once kallikrein formation begins, there is rapid cleavage of unactivated factor XII to factor XIIa, and this positive feedback is favored kinetically over factor XII autoactivation. Examples of surface initiators that can function in this fashion are endotoxin, sulfated mucopolysaccharides, and aggregated Abeta protein. Physiological activation appears to occur along the surface of endothelial cells both by the aforementioned contact-initiated reactions as well as bypass pathways that are independent of factor XII. Factor XII binds primarily to cell surface u-PAR (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor); HK binds to gC1qR via its light chain (domain 5) and to cytokeratin 1 by its heavy chain (domain 3) and, to a lesser degree, by its light chain. Prekallikrein circulates bound to HK (as does coagulation factor XI), and prekallikrein is thereby brought to the surface as HK binds. All cell-binding reactions are dependent on zinc ion. Endothelial cells (HUVECs) have bimolecular complexes of u-PAR-cytokeratin 1 and gC1qR-cytokeratin 1 at the cell surface plus free gC1qR, which is present in substantial molar excess. Factor XII appears to interact primarily with the u-PAR-cytokeratin 1 complex, whereas HK binds primarily to the gC1qR-cytokeratin 1 complex and to free gC1qR. Release of endothelial cell heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) or the enzyme prolylcarboxypeptidase leads to activation of the bradykinin-forming cascade by activating the prekallikrein-HK complex. In contrast to factor XIIa, neither will activate prekallikrein in the absence of HK, both reactions require zinc ion, and the stoichiometry suggests interaction of one molecule of Hsp90 (for example) with one molecule of prekallikrein-HK complex. The presence of factor XII, however, leads to a marked augmentation in reaction rate via the kallikrein feedback as well as to a change to classic enzyme-substrate kinetics. The circumstances in which activation is initiated by factor XII autoactivation or by these factor XII bypasses are yet to be defined. The pathologic conditions in which bradykinin generation appears important include hereditary and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, cough and angioedema due to ACE inhibitors, endotoxin shock, with contributions to conditions as diverse as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, control of blood pressure, and allergic diseases.",

Persons with PAD are at increased risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality from CAD. Modifiable risk factors such as cessation of cigarette smoking and control of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes should be treated. Statins reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and improve exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in persons with PAD and hypercholesterolemia. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel, especially clopidogrel, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be given to all persons with PAD. beta-Blockers should be given if CAD is present. Exercise rehabilitation programs and cilostazol improve exercise time until intermittent claudication.

A single institution retrospective analysis was performed. Children with sickle nephropathy were identified, and the laboratory effects of enalapril and hydroxyurea therapy were evaluated in children with substantial proteinuria. Three children developed proteinuria at 8 +/- 1 years of age. Pre-treatment laboratory studies included a low serum albumin (2.8 +/- 0.8 g/dl) and a highly elevated urine protein/creatinine ratio (6.9 +/- 3.7, normal <0.2). Enalapril treatment for 3.0 +/- 1.3 years normalized serum albumin (3.9 +/- 0.3 g/dl) without significant changes in serum potassium, serum creatinine, or systolic blood pressure. However, urine protein/creatinine remained elevated in the nephrotic range (1.6 +/- 0.7). The addition of hydroxyurea therapy for 3.5 +/- 1.2 years increased fetal hemoglobin levels (7.0 +/- 3.6% to 21.0 +/- 3.2%) and was associated with a near-normal urine protein/creatinine ratio (0.5 +/- 0.1).

In the chronic compensated state of heart failure recent research has focussed on the body's regulatory mechanisms. Today heart failure is understood as a complex interplay of hemodynamic and neurohormonal factors. In pediatrics a large variety of heterogeneous conditions cause heart failure. Some require special therapeutic approaches such as the infusion of prostaglandin for ductal patency, the careful maintenance of balance between systemic and pulmonary circulations or operative treatment. In newborns with critical congenital lesions and in patients in the postoperative period management of acute heart failure becomes important. Chronic heart failure as it is understood today is present in patients with cardiomyopathies and in an increasing number of pediatric patients after palliative surgery. In heart failure due to left-to-right shunts a similar activation of compensatory neurohormonal mechanisms as in adults with chronic heart failure was found. In small clinical trials treatment of these activated compensatory mechanisms with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers showed beneficial effects in pediatric patients. However large clinical multicenter trials as performed in the adult population should be conducted.",

In this study, the glomerular RAS was examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ), and the findings compared with those obtained in control nondiabetic rats. In diabetic rat glomerular extracts, angiotensinogen and angiotensin II (ANG II) levels were increased significantly by 2.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared with nondiabetic controls. No significant differences in ANG I and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were observed between these groups. The HPLC analysis of the glomerular extracts demonstrated that exogenous ANG I was converted into various ANG peptides including ANG II, ANG1-9, and ANG1-7. A significant increase in formation of ANG II from exogenous ANG I was observed in STZ rats compared with control rats. Preincubation of glomerular extracts with captopril resulted in a 20-30% decrease in ANG II conversion from exogenous ANG I in diabetic and control rats. The possible role of ANG1-9 in formation of ANG II was examined by HPLC. Exogenous ANG1-9 in glomerular extracts was converted into ANG II, this conversion being significantly higher in STZ rats than in control rats. These findings provide new information that ANG1-9 is produced in rat glomerular extracts, can be converted to ANG II, and that this conversion is also stimulated in diabetic rat glomeruli. Thus this study demonstrates that in diabetic rats, glomerular ANG II levels are increased due to an increase in angiotensinogen and an increase in the formation of ANG II.",

Clinical trials and observational studies have shown that treating hypertension to target (<140/90 mm Hg) not only lessens morbidity and mortality, but also improves quality of life and preserves cognitive function. Yet, only 34% of hypertensive Americans currently have their hypertension under control, despite widespread treatment. Although single drug therapy is effective in treating hypertension, most patients will require combination drug treatment. Combination therapy--typically a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor, an ARB, or a beta blocker--is appropriate for treatment of older patients, is well tolerated, and can effectively preserve cognitive function.",

The majority of patients with CHF who were eligible for an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta-blocker, or an aldosterone antagonist did not receive these medications, regardless of the treating physician. Cardiologists prescribed significantly more beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists for eligible patients at hospital admission.

In normal subjects, RAS interruption using an ARB produced a 50% greater renal plasma flow (RPF) rise than with an ACE inhibitor, suggesting a substantial contribution of non-ACE pathways. Moreover, immunohistochemistry studies in kidneys of overtly proteinuric diabetic subjects showed up-regulation of chymase, an alternative Ang II-generating enzyme. Our aim was to determine the degree to which the non-ACE pathways contribute to RAS activation in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM).",

    "650": "It is no a secret that we are confronted by an alarmingly increasing number of patients with progressive renal disease. There is ample evidence for the notion that angiotensin II (Ang II) is a major culprit in progression. The vasopeptide Ang II turned out to have also multiple nonhemodynamic pathophysiologic actions on the kidney, including proinflammatory and profibrogenic effects. Diverse complex Ang II generating systems have been identified, including specifically local tissue-specific renin-angiotensin systems (RAS). For example, proximal tubular cells have all components required for a functional RAS capable of synthesizing Ang II. On the other hand, Ang II is not the only effector of the RAS and other peptides generated by the RAS influence renal function and structure as well. Moreover, the discoveries that Ang II can be generated by enzymes other than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and that Ang II and other RAS derived peptides bind to various receptors with different functional consequences have further added to the complexity of this system. Several major clinical trials have clearly shown that ACE inhibitor treatment slows the progression of renal diseases, including in diabetic nephropathy. Well-controlled studies demonstrated that this effect is in part independent of blood pressure control. More recently, with Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) receptor antagonists a similarly protective effect on renal function was seen in patients with type 2 diabetes. Neither ACE inhibitor treatment nor AT(1) receptor blockade completely abrogate progression of renal disease. A recently introduced novel therapeutic approach is combination treatment comprising both ACE inhibitor and AT(1) receptor antagonists. The rationale for this approach is based on several considerations. Small-scale clinical studies, mainly of crossover design, documented that combination therapy is more potent in reducing proteinuria in patients with different chronic renal diseases. Blood pressure as an important confounder was, however, significantly lower in the majority of this studies in the combination treatment arms compared to the respective monotherapies. In a recent prospective study Japanese authors avoided this confounder and demonstrated that combination therapy reduced hard end-points (end stage renal failure or doubling of serum creatinine concentration) by 50% compared to the respective monotherapies. This effect could not be explained by a more pronounced reduction of blood pressure in the combination therapy group. Although these results are encouraging, administration of combination therapy should be reserved currently to special high risk groups. Further studies are necessary to confirm these promising results. It is possible that combination therapy may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly when with coadministered with medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or spironolactone. In our opinion patients with proteinuria >1 g/day despite optimal blood pressure control under RAS-blocking monotherapy are a high-risk group which will presumably benefit from combination therapy.", 
    "651": "Recent studies have revealed that both interferon (IFN) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) exert an anti-fibrotic effect. The aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of the ACE-I and IFN on the murine hepatic fibrosis development. A model of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis was used to assess the effect of the clinically used ACE-I, perindopril (PE), and IFN-beta. The PE and IFN were administered after 2-week treatment with CCl(4), and the hepatic indices of fibrosis were assessed at 8 weeks. Single treatment with either PE or IFN at the clinically available comparable doses significantly attenuated liver fibrogenesis associated with suppression of the hepatic hydroxyproline and serum fibrosis markers. The number of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, and the hepatic alpha1(I)-procollagen mRNA were also markedly inhibited. The inhibitory effect of PE was more potent than IFN, and the combination treatment with PE and IFN almost completely attenuated liver fibrosis development. In vitro, the angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blocker and IFN suppressed the AT-II-induced proliferation and alpha1(I)-procollagen mRNA expression of the activated hepatic stellate cells. The combination treatment of the clinically used PE and IFN may provide a new strategy for anti-liver fibrosis therapy.",

Prevalence rates increased with age, from 0.2 per 1000 in people aged under 35 years of age to 125 per 1000 in those aged 85 years and over. Coronary heart disease (present in 47%) was the most common comorbid condition in men with heart failure, whereas hypertension (present in 46%) was the most common condition in women. Recording of cardiovascular risk factors was generally higher in younger patients than in older patients, and in men than in women. Blood pressure (92% of men and 90% of women) and smoking status (84% of men and 77% of women) were generally the best-recorded cardiovascular risk factors. Blood electrolytes were recorded in about 83% of men and 75% of women. Only 17% of men and 11% of women with heart failure had a record of undergoing an echocardiogram.

    "657": "The role of the RAAS in development and maintenance of blood pressure is well established. In addition, the deleterious effects of angiotensin II on the heart, vasculature, and kidneys have been clearly defined. There seems to be a close relationship between endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes and coronary artery disease) and angiotensin II. The signaling pathways for insulin in the vascular wall interacts with the angiotensin signaling, giving rise to potential mechanisms for development of diabetes and resulting harmful effects. A large number of clinical trials using ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown significant reduction in secondary endpoints in the development of new onset of diabetes. Ongoing prospective studies involving ARBs (eg, the Nateglinide and Valsartan Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research trial) and ACE inhibitors (eg, the Diabetes Re-duction Assessment with Ramipril and Rosiglita-zone Medication trial) are testing the ability of certain agents to prevent type 2 diabetes. In the meantime, it is important to recognize insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome as entities that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition to lifestyle modifications, managing endothelial dysfunction and protecting the vasculature will help prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "658": "Large, placebo-controlled RCTs that involve only diabetic patients who have hypertension have not been performed. Subgroup analyses of hyper-tension control from several recent RCTs un-equivocally demonstrated greater benefit in diabetic populations (see Table 3) with ACE inhibitors, TDs, and CCBs. Treatment with fBs(atenolol) also was beneficial in diabetic patients who had hypertension in the actively-controlled UKPDS. The results of three RCTs support intensive BP control in diabetic patients (see Table 4). In these trials, diabetic patients gained more benefit than nondiabetic patients. Such an effect is consistent with the fact that diabetics are at higher risk for CV events. Although there are limited data from RCTs with head-to-head comparison of newer agents (eg,ACE inhibitors, ARBs, CCBs) to show that these drugs are better than diuretics and betaBs in reducing CV events by treating hypertension in the diabetic population, the available data support ACE inhibitors (and ARBs if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated) as an initial drug of choice in diabetic,hypertensive patients (see Table 5). Most diabetic patients require three or four drugs to control their BP to target range; as such, it is not necessary to justify the choice of any single class of drug. Tight BP control is cost-effective and is more rewarding than hyperglycemic control in diabetic,hypertensive patients. The optimal goal in diabetics should be to achieve BP that is less than 130/80 mm Hg. Appropriate action should be taken if BP is greater than 140/85 mm Hg. In subjects who have diabetes and renal insufficiency,the BP should be decreased to less than 125/75 mm Hg to delay the progression of renal failure. Limited data suggest that an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is the agent of choice, especially in patients who have proteinuria or renal insufficiency. betaBs can be the first-line agent in diabetics who have CAD. TDs and CCBs are the second line drugs.AAAs should be avoided. Most hypertensive patients require more than one agent to adequately control their BP. There is no evidence to support one combination regimen over the others, nevertheless, the combination of an ACE inhibitor with a TD or a fPB may be more beneficial and cost effective than other combinations in the diabetic population. Large outcome studies that compare different combination therapies in hypertensive,diabetic patients are needed.",

Patients taking ACEI had worse overall survival (OS) compared to patients not taking ACEI (38.7 versus 73.3 months after diagnosis; P=0.025). Among patients with hypertension, both OS and progression-free survival were significantly shorter in patients taking ACEI. There were no significant differences between the studied groups in standard prognostic parameters for MM (age, albumin, beta 2-microglobulin, IPI and Durie-Salmon stage, LDH, CRP, performance status) or in engraftment.

    "673": "We have recently shown that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade may represent optimal therapy for patients with early diabetic nephropathy who show aldosterone breakthrough during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment, and who no longer show the maximal antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibition. In this study, we explored the effects of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone on urinary protein excretion in patients with chronic renal disease with proteinuria persistently more than 0.5 g/d, despite maintained blood pressure (BP) control, and including the use of an ACE inhibitor (trandolapril) for at least 10 months. After a 12-week study period of spironolactone treatment (25 mg/d), BP did not change but urinary protein excretion was significantly reduced. The extent of the reduction was on average significantly greater in diabetic patients than in nondiabetics. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, although urinary type IV collagen did not decrease after conventional treatment, it was significantly reduced by spironolactone. None of the patients developed serious hyperkalemia, and no other adverse events were observed. All patients in this study had relatively well preserved renal function. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that in patients with chronic renal disease with proteinuria persistently more than 0.5 g/d, despite BP control and the use of an ACE inhibitor, adding spironolactone to the conventional treatment produces beneficial effects on urinary protein excretion, particularly in patients with diabetes. Our study suggests that attenuation of mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated effects may become a new goal for patients who escape the antiproteinuric effects of the conventional treatment. Additional, larger, prospective, randomized double-blind studies will be needed for general acceptance of this strategy.",

It is composed of two domains, known as N- and C-domains, and it is primarily involved in blood pressure regulation. Although the physiological functions of ACE are not limited to its cardiovascular role, it has been an attractive target for drug design due to its critical role in cardiovascular and renal disease. We examined natural structures based on bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) extracted from Bothrops jararaca venom for ACE inhibition. Modeling, docking and molecular dynamics were used to study the conserved residues in the S2', S1' and S1 positions that allow enzyme-substrate/inhibitor contacts. These positions are conserved in other oligopeptidases, and they form tight and non-specific contacts with lisinopril, enalapril and BPP9a inhibitors. The only specific inhibitor for human somatic ACE (sACE) was BPP9a, which is instable in the N-sACE-BPP9a complex due to repulsive electrostatic interactions between Arg P4-Arg 412 residues. Specificity for the C-terminal domain in human sACE inhibition was confirmed by electrostatic interaction with the Asp 1008 residue. Peptide-like BPP structures, naturally developed by snakes across millions of years of evolution, appear to be good candidates for the development of domain-selective ACE inhibitors with high stability and improved pharmacological profiles.",

Clinical trial data support valsartan as an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients with chronic heart failure. Valsartan is generally well tolerated, with renal impairment, elevated serum creatinine and potassium levels, and dizziness being the most common adverse effects; consequently, patients experiencing those adverse events while taking ACE inhibitors are likely to experience them with valsartan. Although further study is needed, differences in effectiveness among races may exist with use of valsartan; however, at this time, valsartan is recommended as an alternative to ACE inhibitors regardless of race.

However, results of smaller studies suggest an increase of in-stent-restenosis under ACE-i administration. The effects of ACE-i and valsartan after bare metal stent implantation of the culprit type B2/C lesion should be compared. Seven hundred patients were treated either by ACE-i in cases of LVEF<50% or 80 mg valsartan in cases of LVEF> or =50%. Restenosis rates after 6 months were analysed in 399 patients under valsartan and 224 patients under ACE-i with control angiography and major adverse cardiac events (death, infarction, reintervention) in a follow-up of up to 4 (mean 2.6) years in all patients. In-stent-restenosis was found in 19.5% under valsartan and in 34% under ACE-i (p<0.005). In diabetic patients, restenosis occurred in 24% under valsartan and in 43% under ACE-i (p<0.01). In initial acute coronary syndrome (ACS), restenosis rate was 14% under valsartan and 43% under ACE-i (p<0.0001). In stable angina, restenosis rates were 26.5% and 27.5%, respectively. Total MACE rates revealed significant differences in ACS due to reintervention rates of 22% and 7% under ACE-i and valsartan (p<0.0001). The administration of 80 mg valsartan after bare metal stent implantation leads to a reduction of in-stent-restenosis compared to ACE-i. This effect is mainly due to beneficial effects of valsartan in cases with initial ACS. Major differences between ACE-i and valsartan are discussed including inflammation, activation of neutrophils, mode of bradykinin activation, AT2 receptor stimulation and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells.", 
    "690": "The effects of the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel opener YM099, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, on the progression of renal disease in rats with surgical renal mass reduction (RMR) were evaluated. Rats were subtotal (5/6) nephrectomized by resection of the renal poles. After 2 weeks of RMR, rats were randomized to three groups and treated for 6 weeks: no treatment (n=9); YM099 at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg by daily oral administration (n=9); or captopril at a dose of 50 mg/kg by daily oral administration (n=9). Sham-operated rats were used as normal animals (n=9). In RMR rats with no treatment, proteinuria progressively developed. At 8 weeks after RMR, renal function as assessed by plasma creatinine (Pcr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was impaired. Pharmacological activation of KATP channel opening by YM099 showed no beneficial effect on proteinuria and renal functional parameters. On the other hand, pharmacological ACE inhibition by captopril significantly attenuated proteinuria, and tended to inhibit the increases in Pcr and BUN; however, these effects were not statistically significant. The presents study indicates that YM099 exhibits no renoprotection with antiproteinuric effect in rats with progressive renal disease. These findings suggest that activation of KATP channel opening may play no role in the retardation of progressive renal disease.", 
    "691": "Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index are independent predictors of adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality. In hypertension and aging, central elastic arteries become stiffer, diastolic pressure decreases, and central systolic and pulse pressures are augmented due to increased PWV and early return of reflected waves to the heart from the periphery. Valuable information on arterial properties such as stiffness can be obtained from both central (aortic) and peripheral (radial artery) pressure waveforms, but absolute values of wave reflection amplitude and wasted left ventricular (LV) pressure energy can only be obtained from the central arterial pressure waveform. As the arterial system becomes stiffer, there is a marked increase in central systolic and pulse pressures and wasted LV energy, along with a decrease in pulse pressure amplification. The increase in aortic systolic and pulse pressures are due primarily to increases in PWV and wave reflection amplitude with a small increase in incident wave amplitude. In individuals with very stiff elastic arteries (eg, in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension), there is a decrease in diastolic pressure. These changes in pressure components increase LV afterload and myocardial oxygen demand and therefore cause an undesirable mismatch between ventricle emptying and arterial pulse wave transmission, which promotes ventricular hypertrophy. High systolic and pulse pressures resulting from advanced age or hypertension increase circumferential arterial wall stress, which likely causes breakdown of medial elastin and increases the possibility of local fatigue, endothelial damage and development of atherosclerosis. Vasodilator drugs may have little direct effect on large central elastic arteries, but at the same time, their effects on peripheral muscular arteries reduce wave reflection amplitude and markedly lower systolic and pulse pressures and ventricular afterload. These beneficial effects on central arterial pressure can occur with or without a reduction in cuff blood pressure (BP) and may explain the apparent \"pressure-independent\" effects of drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Therefore, optimal treatment of high BP and its complications should include consideration of arterial stiffness, augmentation of aortic pressure, and LV wasted energy, all of which should be reduced to the lowest possible level.", 
    "692": "Increasingly, detailed characterization of human molecular genetic variation will facilitate the use of genetic information in preventing, diagnosing, and treating common diseases. One promising application is the identification of genetic variants influencing responses to drugs used to lower blood pressure (BP) and prevent target-organ complications of hypertension. This update on gene markers to guide antihypertensive therapy highlights polymorphisms recently reported to predict interindividual differences in response to antihypertensive medications. However, single-site variation in most genes makes only a small contribution to differences in BP response, and, after all known genetic and environmental predictors have been considered, most variation in responses still remains unexplained. Advancing beyond our current \"trial-and-error\" approach to selecting drug therapy in individual patients will undoubtedly require whole-genome approaches to discover additional, novel genetic pathways influencing drug response. In addition, larger samples will be required to more fully characterize genetic variation within candidate genes and to consider the joint effects of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Eventually, knowledge of genetic variants that influence BP responses may allow more individualized tailoring of therapy to optimally reduce BP and target-organ damage.", 
    "693": "Depressed cardiac parasympathetic activity is associated with electrical instability and adverse outcomes after myocardial infarction (MI). Heart rate turbulence (HRT), reflecting reflex vagal activity, and heart rate variability (HRV), reflecting tonic autonomic variations are both reduced in the subacute phase of MI. However, the evolution of these components of cardiac autonomic control between subacute and chronic phase of MI has not been defined. We prospectively studied 100 consecutive patients with a recent first MI with ST-segment elevation, who underwent successful direct percutaneous coronary interventions. Beta-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were administered according to the state-of-the-art medical practice guidelines. HRT and HRV were measured from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings 10 days and 12 months after the index MI. There was no significant difference in mean RR interval between the subacute and chronic phase of MI (875 +/- 145 versus 859 +/- 122 ms). Indices of HRV increased significantly during the observation period (SDNN: from 88.8 +/- 26.8 to 116.0 +/- 35.7 ms, P < 0.001; SDNNi: from 37.9 +/- 15.9 to 46.0 +/- 16.3 ms, P < 0.001; SDANN: from 79.6 +/- 34.7 to 105.6 +/- 35.4 ms, P < 0.001). In contrast, there were no significant changes in indices of HRT (turbulence onset: from -0.008 +/- 0.022 to -0.012 +/- 0.025%; turbulence slope: from 7.78 +/- 5.9 to 8.06 +/- 6.8 ms/beat). In contrast to reflex autonomic activity, there was a significant recovery of tonic autonomic activity within 12 months after MI. These different patterns of recovery of reflex versus tonic cardiac autonomic control after MI need to be considered when risk stratifying post-MI patients.", 
    "694": "The proteinuria is frequently the initial insult to the kidney and it usually followed by a progressive decline in the glomerular filtration rate. The angiotensin II mediate by glomerular permeselective function via the opening of large pores after elevations in transmembrane pressure and by acting on the glomerular pressure, too. There is evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone or with the angiotensin receptor-blockade may improve the glomerular size-selective function and the hemodynamic intrarenal accounted output of plasma proteins. We evaluated the Enalapril action only in two progressive doses (stage 1: 0.2 mg/kg/day and stage 2: 0.4 mg/kg/per day, respectively) and then we evaluated the combinated treatment (stage 3) with Enalapril (0.2 mg/kg/per day) + Losartan (0.8 mg/kg/day) in thirteen patients (2 female/ 11 male, mean age 12 yrs, r: 10y-16y) normotensive with middle or heavy proteinuria and normal glomerular filtration rate. The study lasted six months. In the three stages occurred decrease of the urinary protein, but only the stage 2 and 3 was significant (p < 0.05). And the three stages had significant reduction of the mean blood pressure, too (p < 0.05). On the other hand there has a good correlation between the less proteinuria and the descent of the mean blood pressure in the stage I (r: 0.75, p < 0.05) and the stage 2 (r: 0.70, p < 0.05), but this did not occur in the stage 3 (r: 0.37, p < 0.1).

Thirty New Zealand White rabbits were randomly divided into two groups (15 each); one group was administered Captopril 10 mg/kg/day per os as an ACE inhibitor, and the other group received on saline as a vehicle from 7 days prior to operation until the graft was harvest (1, 8, or 14 weeks). A 10-mm segment of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft (3 mm in diameter) was implanted in the right common carotid artery of the rabbits; 15 rabbits had by-pass grafting alone (Graft Alone group) and the other 15 rabbits had by-pass graft along with the ACEI (Graft plus ACEI group). The artery grafts were harvested. The intima to media height ratio (IMHR) and the TGF-beta1 mRNA expression level in perianastomotic graft tissue by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The IMHRs gradually increased from 1 to 14 weeks in both groups (vs. 1 wk in each group, p<0.05). The IMHRs of the Graft plus ACEI group were comparable to those of Graft Alone group at 1 week, but significantly lower at 8 and 14 weeks (vs. Graft Alone group, p<0.05). The TGF-beta1 mRNA expression levels of the Graft plus ACEI group were clearly lower than those of the Graft Alone group at 1 and 8 weeks (vs. Graft Alone group, p<0.05), but similar at 14 weeks. TGF-beta1 in the synthetic artery graft of the Graft Alone group was up-regulated as early as 1 week after the operation, when no definitive development of a quantifiable neointima was observed. The TGF-beta1 mRNA expression of the Graft Alone group was highest at 8 weeks and lowest at 14 weeks (vs. 1 week, *p<0.05), but such time-dependent changes were not observed in the Graft plus ACEI group. The results indicated that ACEI reduced intimal hyperplasia in the grafts of the Graft plus ACEI group and also suppressed TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in perianastomotic intimal hyperplasia tissues to the normal artery level. Perianastomotic intimal hyperplasia in synthetic arterial graft is considered to be related to TGF-beta1, the expression of which is locally mediated by angiotensin II and, therefore, suppressed by ACEI.", 
    "700": "The levels of amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) in the brain represent a dynamic equilibrium state as a result of their biosynthesis from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases, their degradation by a team of amyloid-degrading enzymes, their subsequent oligomerization, and deposition into senile plaques. While most therapeutic attention has focused on developing inhibitors of secretases to prevent Abeta formation, enhancing the rate of Abeta degradation represents an alternative and viable strategy. Current evidence both in vivo and in vitro suggests that there are three major players in amyloid turnover: neprilysin, endothelin converting enzyme(s), and insulin-degrading enzyme, all of which are zinc metallopeptidases. Other proteases have also been implicated in amyloid metabolism, including angiotensin-converting enzyme, and plasmin but for these the evidence is less compelling. Neprilysin and endothelin converting enzyme(s) are homologous membrane proteins of the M13 peptidase family, which normally play roles in the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of regulatory peptides. Insulin-degrading enzyme is structurally and mechanistically distinct. The regional, cellular, and subcellular localizations of these enzymes differ, providing an efficient and diverse mechanism for protecting the brain against the normal accumulation of toxic Abeta peptides. Reduction in expression levels of some of these proteases following insults (e.g., hypoxia and ischemia) or aging might predispose to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, enhancement of their levels by gene delivery or pharmacological means could be neuroprotective. Even a relatively small enhancement of Abeta metabolism could slow the inexorable progression of the disease. The relative merits of targeting these enzymes for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease will be reviewed and possible side-effects of enhancing their activity evaluated.", 
    "701": "The activities of both sarcolemmal (SL) Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, which maintain the intracellular cation homeostasis, have been shown to be depressed in heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI). Because the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated in heart failure, this study tested the hypothesis that attenuation of cardiac SL changes in congestive heart failure (CHF) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with prevention of alterations in gene expression for SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. CHF in rats due to MI was induced by occluding the coronary artery, and 3 wk later the animals were treated with an ACE inhibitor, imidapril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), for 4 wk. Heart dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in the infarcted animals were associated with depressed SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activities. Protein content and mRNA levels for Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger as well as Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1)-isoforms were depressed, whereas those for alpha(3)-isoform were increased in the failing heart. These changes in SL activities, protein content, and gene expression were attenuated by treating the infarcted animals with imidapril. The beneficial effects of imidapril treatment on heart function and cardiac hypertrophy as well as SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activities in the infarcted animals were simulated by enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist. These results suggest that blockade of RAS in CHF improves SL Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activities in the failing heart by preventing changes in gene expression for SL proteins.",

The isolated mesenteric arteriolar bed of Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) was perfused with Krebs or Krebs plus enalaprilat (10 nM), and drugs were injected alone or in association. BK (10 ng)-induced relaxation was potentiated by Ang-(1-7) (2.2 microg) in the presence or absence of enalaprilat. Ang-(1-7) receptor blockade [A-779 (4.8 microg)] did not interfere with the BK effect in preparations perfused with normal Krebs, but reversed the increased BK relaxation observed after ACE inhibition. PGI2 release by mesenteric vessels was not altered by BK or Ang-(1-7) alone, but was increased when both peptides were injected in association, in the absence or in the presence of enalaprilat. ACE inhibition caused a 2-fold increase in the BK tissue levels, and a significant decrease in the Ang-(1-7) values. We conclude that endogenous Ang-(1-7) has an important contribution to the effect of ACE inhibitors participating in the enhancement of BK response. The mechanism of Ang-(1-7) potentiating effect probably involves an increased production of PGI2. Our results suggest that a different enzymatic pathway (non-related to ACE) is involved in the local Ang-(1-7) metabolism.", 
    "720": "We examined whether captopril exerts beneficial effect on homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction in vivo and whether this effect of captopril is associated with a reduction of endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given intravenous injections of homocysteine (10 mg/kg/day) to induce endothelial dysfunction. Captopril treatment (3 mg/kg/day, i.v.) was taken in some rats after homocysteine administration. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was tested in aortic rings. Serum levels of ADMA, nitrite/nitrate, malondialdehyde (MDA), and creatinine were measured. Furthermore, superoxide dismutase activity in liver and angiotensin converting enzyme activity in serum were also assayed. Administration of homocysteine to rats for 4 weeks significantly impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation compared with control rats. This impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation was accompanied by elevated serum concentration of ADMA and decreased serum content of nitrite/nitrate. Moreover, serum concentration of MDA was remarkably increased, whereas liver superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in homocysteine-treated group compared with control. Chronic captopril treatment not only improved the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, but also prevented the elevation of serum ADMA and MDA levels, as well as reduction of serum nitrite/nitrate contents and liver superoxide dismutase activity. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity and creatinine had no significant difference between the three groups. These results suggest that chronic captopril treatment reduces endogenous inhibitor of NOS in rats with homocysteine injection, which may contribute to the beneficial effect of captopril on homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction in vivo, and may be secondary to the antioxidative action of captopril.",

Changes in circling behavior paralleled changes in CPP in the presence of MA. Pre-treatment with ginsenosides (50 or 150 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the MA-induced circling behavior and CPP. This attenuation was reversed by the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist 1,3,7-trimethyl-8-(3-chrostyryl)xanthine (CSC; 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner, but neither the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT; 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) nor the A2B receptor antagonist alloxazine (ALX; 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg) had any such effect. MA-induced increases in activator protein (AP)-1 DNA binding activity, Fos-related antigen immunoreactivity (FRA-IR), proenkephalin mRNA expression, and proenkephalin-like immunoreactivity were reduced consistently in the striatum of animals that were pretreated with ginsenosides. These reductions were largely prevented by CSC, but not by CPT or ALX. Our results suggest that the stimulation of A2A receptors by ginsenosides attenuates the changes in behavior and the increases in AP-1 DNA binding activity, FRA-IR, and proenkephalin gene expression in mouse striatum that are induced by MA.",

Increasing doses of diuretics, possibly because in many cases this included two drugs, but not the other drugs, were significantly (P < 0.001) associated with impaired renal function. For the other three drug groups patients on doses of any drug at lower than the defined daily dose (DDD) did not have significantly different creatinine or creatinine clearance from those on doses at or above the DDD.",

We measured markers of inflammation such as acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen), leukocyte count and body temperature.", 
    "740": "The mean interval between initiation of ACEI treatment and first manifestation of angioedema was 35.8 +/- 5.3 months. During symptomatic angioedema, mean plasma levels of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly increased by 7.3-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, while leukocyte count and body temperature were normal. These changes disappeared after successful treatment of angioedema and were not found in patients with angioedema of unknown cause and those receiving ACEI without having experienced angioedema.",

Two types of lupin protein isolate were prepared. Both types of protein isolate showed good foaming activity, comparable to egg white. Protein isolate extracted under acid conditions showed higher foaming activity than protein isolate extracted at neutral pH. The lipoxygenase activity was much reduced in both of the protein isolates. The protein isolate extracted at neutral pH showed a stronger angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition than the protein isolate extracted under acidic pH. In contrast, the protein isolate extracted under acid conditions had a greater sodium cholate binding capacity, comparable to that of cholestyramine. Lupin samples showed less DPPH radical scavenging activity than deoiled soybean. The deoiling method did not affect the functional properties, lipoxygenase activity, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, sodium cholate binding, and radical scavenging activity.",

Allergic reactions to medications or foods can cause acute angioedema. Hereditary angioedema is a rare disorder, which is related to low levels or abnormal functioning of C1 inhibitors. Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is most frequently associated with B-cell lymphoproliferative disease. Some drugs including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can cause angioedema. Environmental elements such as pressure on the skin and exercise also can result in angioedema in some individuals. In addition, angioedema sometimes may occur in serum sickness, immune system disorders, or may be associated with eosinophilia.", 
    "744": "The dose-response relationship between pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin II concentration in the circulation, on the one hand, and decrease of blood pressure, on the other hand, has been well established. In contrast it is currently unclear which dose of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers is optimal for nephroprotection. Clinical studies are rendered quite complex by an early decrease of glomerular filtration after RAS blockade and by side effects at higher doses such as renal sodium loss, hyperkalemia, anemia, etc. Animal experiments and recent clinical studies suggest that the doses of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers required for maximal reduction of proteinuria (as a surrogate marker) and for optimal nephroprotection (retardation of the loss of glomerular filtration) exceed those required for maximal lowering of blood pressure. Ongoing studies try to define the relative merits of high dose monotherapy (ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) versus a combination therapy of the two.",

Incubation with activin A significantly stimulated TGF-beta1, PAI-1 and connective tissue growth factor RNA expression and increased production of extracellular matrix proteins in mesangial cells. In rats with anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis, expression of glomerular activin A mRNA and protein paralled the expression of TGF-beta and other indices of fibrosis, showing little change from normal on day 1, a marked, 70-fold increase of activin protein production on day 6, and a subsequent decrease at day 12. Antifibrotic therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril significantly reduced glomerular activin A production.",

Typically, such macromolecular drug-targeting preparations are administered intravenously. In the present study, we investigated the fate of captopril-lysozyme following subcutaneous administration, a convenient route for long-term treatment. The absorption from the subcutaneous injection site and renal uptake of lysozyme were determined by gamma scintigraphy in rats. Bioavailability, renal accumulation, and stability of the captopril-lysozyme conjugate were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography analysis and by ACE activity measurements. Lysozyme was absorbed gradually and completely from the subcutaneous injection site within 24 h and accumulated specifically in kidneys. After subcutaneous injection of the captopril-lysozyme conjugate, higher renal captopril levels and lower captopril-lysozyme levels in urine indicated the improved renal accumulation in comparison with intravenous administration of the conjugate, as well as its stability at the injection site. After both treatments, captopril-lysozyme conjugate effectuated renal ACE inhibition, whereas plasma ACE was not inhibited. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that we can use the subcutaneous route to administer drug delivery preparations like the captopril-lysozyme conjugate.",

All of the patients were treated with perindopril (4 mg/day) and, after one and six months of therapy, their levels of plasma fibrinogen (Fb), t-PA antigen, PAI-1 antigen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), ACE activity and blood pressure were measured. ACE and PAI-1 genotypes were identified by means of the polymerase chain reaction on DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Untreated patients had significantly higher levels of Fb, PAI-1 (p < 0.01) and t-PA (p < 0.05) regardless of their ACE or PAI-1 genotypes. Perindopril reduced blood pressure regardless of ACE or PAI-1 genotype (p < 0.001). ACE II homozygotes showed the greatest decrease in ACE activity (p < 0.01) and a significant reduction in Fb levels (p < 0.05) after just one month of treatment. Analysis of the group as a whole revealed an increase in t-PA antigen levels after six months of treatment, regardless of ACE or PAI-1 genotype (p < 0.01).", 
    "753": "Our results show that essential hypertension predisposes to the procoagulant state characterized by hyperfibrinogenemia and hypofibrinolysis. Perindopril reduced fibrinogen levels in ACE II homozygotes due to its more potent inhibitory action on the renin-angiotensin system in such patients. It improved fibrinolysis by increasing t-PA levels regardless of ACE and PAI-1 genotype.", 
    "754": "The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or AT1 angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) consistently and significantly reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes in patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure. The mechanisms underlying this protective effect appear to be complex and may involve an improvement of both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. These two effects may result, at least in part, from the well known effects of these pharmacological agents on the vascular system on the one hand, on the ionic balance on the other hand. Indeed, the vasodilation induced by ACEIs or ARBs could improve the blood circulation in skeletal muscles, thus favouring peripheral insulin action, but also in the pancreas, thus promoting insulin secretion. Preserving cellular potassium and magnesium pools by blocking the aldosterone effects could also improve both cellular insulin action and insulin secretion. However, besides these classical effects, new mechanisms have been recently suggested. A direct effect of the inhibition of angiotensin and/or of the enhancement of bradykinin on various steps of the insulin cascade signalling has been described as well an increase in GLUT4 glucose transporters after RAS inhibition. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that angiotensin II inhibits adipogenic differentiation of human adipocytes via A1 receptors and, therefore, it has been hypothesised that RAS blockade may prevent diabetes by promoting the recruitment and differentiation of adipocytes. Finally, some lipophilic ARBs appear to induce PPAR-gamma activity in the adipose tissue. Hence, the protection against type 2 diabetes observed after RAS inhibition may be partially linked to a thiazolidinedione-like effect. In conclusion, numerous physiological and biochemical mechanisms could explain the protective effect of RAS inhibition against the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals with arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure. What might be the main mechanism in the overall protection effect of ACEIs or ARBs remains an open question.", 
    "755": "Most individuals with arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure are insulin-resistant and at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), using an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or a selective angiotensin receptor AT1 blocker (ARB), may exert favourable metabolic effects capable of preventing T2DM in high risk individuals. We performed a meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of RAS inhibition on the incidence of new cases of T2DM in patients with arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure. Ten RCTs with cardiovascular prognosis as primary endpoints analysed the incidence of T2DM as secondary endpoints or as post-hoc analysis after a mean follow-up of 1 to 6 years: five with an ACEI and five with an ARB, compared with a placebo (n=4) or a reference drug (beta-blocker or diuretic: n=5; amlodipine: n=2). Eight RCTs concerned hypertensive patients: STOP Hypertension-2 (lisinopril or enalapril vs beta-blocker or diuretic), CAPPP (captopril vs thiazide or beta-blocker), HOPE (ramipril vs placebo), ALLHAT (lisinopril vs chlorthalidone and lisinopril vs amlodipine), LIFE (losartan vs atenolol), SCOPE (candesartan vs placebo), ALPINE (candesartan vs placebo) and VALUE (valsartan vs amlodipine). Two RCTs concerned patients with congestive heart failure: SOLVD (enalapril vs placebo) and CHARM-overall programme (candesartan vs placebo). Overall, 2 675 new cases of T2DM (7.40%) were observed in the group of 36 167 patients receiving a treatment with ACEI or ARA as compared with 3 842 events (9.63%) in the group of 39 902 control patients. A mean weighed relative risk reduction of new T2DM of 22% (95% CI: 18, 26; p<0.00001) was observed after RAS inhibition. The beneficial effect was similar with ACEIs and with ARBs as well as in patients with hypertension and in those with heart failure, and was also present whatever the comparator (placebo or beta-blockers/diuretics or amlodipine). The number needed-to-treat to avoid one new case of T2DM averaged 45 patients over 4-5 years. In conclusion, RAS inhibition consistently and significantly reduces the incidence of T2DM in individuals with arterial hypertension or with congestive heart failure. Considering the pandemic of T2DM, such pharmacological approach deserves further attention among the strategies aiming at preventing T2DM.",

Age/gender/treatment-adjusted KM analysis revealed significant differences only in the cohorts with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), defined as LVEF >45%, or in less symptomatic patients (New York Heart Association I or II). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that beta-blocker (BB) was associated with a significant reduction in mortality from cardiac causes, and either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) was significantly related to the improvement of survival in the MI cohort (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.222 and 0.497, p<0.05), even though these medicines were used significantly less often in the MI cohort.",

Symptoms are often indistinguishable from those with obstructive coronary artery disease. The prognosis of patients with unstable angina and nonobstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is not benign and includes a 2% risk of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days of follow-up. Recent work has shown that at least 20% of women with normal or nonobstructive angiography have myocardial ischemia, likely due to atherosclerosis-related endothelial dysfunction, which itself is associated with an increased risk of later adverse cardiac events and development of frank future obstructive disease. Randomized placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, L-arginine, statins, and exercise may relieve symptoms, vascular dysfunction, or both; however, longer-term studies evaluating cardiac event rates need to be performed.",

We estimated the projected benefit of a secondary prevention \"poly-portfolio\" strategy, including pharmacologic and lifestyle approaches for those with coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke. Based on recent clinical trial results and clinical guidelines, combinations of a high-dose statin, low to standard doses of antihypertensive therapy, aspirin, omega-3 fish oil, cardiac rehabilitation, and diet were evaluated. Patients with CHD, post-myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke were projected to experience 84%, 91%, and 77% reductions, respectively, in CHD events from a pharmacologic approach. Numbers of those needed to treat (NNT) for 5 years were 9 to 11 to prevent 1 CHD event, and 21 to prevent 1 stroke. Post-MI patients were projected to experience a 93% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 16) from a pharmacologic approach and a 97% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 15) with the addition of lifestyle changes.

    "774": "The general profile of women with cardiac failure differs from that of the male population, especially with respect to aetiology and prognosis. Women are often older, have preserved systolic function more often and a higher incidence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Moreover, global mortality is lower in women. From the therapeutic point of view, women with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction probably benefit from ACE inhibitors but those with asymptomatic dysfunction have no reduction in mortality with this class of drugs. In addition, treatment with ACE inhibitors is usually interrupted in women because of a higher incidence of secondary effects. The poorer tolerance could be explained by the profile of women with cardiac failure. The large scale multicentre trials with betablockers included very few women. In MERIT-HF, in which there was a large number of women (23%), the female subgroup was the only one in which a benefit in mortality was not demonstrated. However, a retrospective analysis of the data of this subgroup plus a meta-analysis of all trials with betablockers does show improved mortality with this class of drugs in women. In a retrospective study of the DIG study, there seems to be a difference in the effects of digoxin between men and women; the prescription of digoxin is associated with a higher overall mortality in women. Finally, women seem to require diuretics more often than do men. There are many explanations for the differences observed in therapeutic responses between men and women. The role of sex hormones is often evoked, although it has never been clinically proved. The treatment of heart failure in women should take clinical and biological factors specific to women into account and may explain the relative inefficacy of certain forms of treatment.", 
    "775": "In Europe, 20% of the populations is over 65 years of age. About 5% of the older adults have heart failure. Heart failure (HF) in the elderly is an increasing public health problem, leading cause of hospitalization in older patients and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Prognosis has improved only slightly during the past decade. Typically, heart failure occurs when ventricles do not fill (diastolic heart failure - DHF) or empty blood (systolic heart failure - SHF) properly. Transthoracic echocardiography is the key investigation to confirm the underlying structural and functional abnormalities of the heart. Patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be treated with a diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and a beta-blocker (unless contraindicated). Several epidemiologic studies have recently shown that more than 50% of older patients who present with symptoms of HF have DHF. While numerous large trials have established specific therapies for SHF, such trials are lacking for DHF. The finding of similar key pathophysiologic abnormalities in DHF and SHF suggests the possibility that therapies that have been successful for SHF may have a role in therapy for DHF. A recent survey showed that despite physicians' awareness of the benefits of beta-blocker therapy, only minority of patients with heart failure are treated with beta-blocker or combination of ACE inhibitors and beta-blocker.", 
    "776": "Progression of a variety of chronic renal diseases may be largely due to secondary hemodynamic and metabolic factors, rather than the activity of the underlying disorder. Some of these factors can be treated, possibly preventing or minimizing further glomerular injury. An important component of this approach is antihypertensive therapy, particularly with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and, at least in patients with type 2 diabetes, angiotensin II receptor blockers. The clinical studies supporting importance of blood pressure control in diabetic and nondiabetic chronic renal diseases and recommended treatment goals will be presented here.", 
    "777": "Angiotensin II (A-II) is the main effector of the renin-angiotensin system. A-II functions by binding its type 1 (AT1) receptors to cause vasoconstriction and retention of sodium and fluid. Several AT1 receptor antagonists-a group of drugs collectively called \"sartans\"-have been marketed during the past few years for treatment of hypertension and heart failure. At least 15 case reports describe oligohydramnios, fetal growth retardation, pulmonary hypoplasia, limb contractures, and calvarial hypoplasia in various combinations in association with maternal losartan, candesartan, valsartan, or telmisartan treatment during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Stillbirth or neonatal death is frequent in these reports, and surviving infants may exhibit renal damage. The fetal abnormalities, which are strikingly similar to those produced by maternal treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, are probably related to extreme sensitivity of the fetus to the hypotensive action of these drugs. Very little information is available regarding the outcome of human pregnancies in which the mother was treated with an AT1 receptor antagonist during the first trimester, but animal studies have not demonstrated teratogenic effects after maternal treatment with large doses of AT1 receptor antagonists during organogenesis. We conclude that pharmacological suppression of the fetal renin-angiotensin system through ACE inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade seems to disrupt fetal vascular perfusion and renal function. We recommend that maternal treatment with AT1 receptor antagonists be avoided during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and that women who become pregnant while taking one of these medications be changed to an antihypertensive drug of a different class as soon as the pregnancy is recognized.", 
    "778": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is the cornerstone in its treatment.

In the absence of class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs sinus rhythm is maintained in only 30% of patients during the first year after electrical cardioversion (ECV).

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use on efficacy of ECV, and occurrence of subacute recurrences.", 
    "783": "One hundred-seven consecutive patients with persistent AF underwent ECV. In twenty-eight (26%) patients ACE inhibitors had been started before initiation of the present episode of AF ('pre-treated' patients).", 
    "784": "ECV was successful in 96% of patients who were on ACE inhibitors before start of the present episode of AF compared to 80% of the patients not pre-treated (p = 0.04). After 1 month of follow-up 49% of the pre-treated patients and 50% of those not pre-treated with ACE inhibition were still in sinus rhythm (p=ns). Multivariate analysis showed that pre-treatment with ACE inhibitors and a smaller left atrial size were independent predictors of successful ECV (OR = 5.8, C.I. 1.3-26.1, and OR = 5.6, C.I. 1.2-25.3, respectively).", 
    "785": "Pre-treatment with ACE inhibitors may improve acute success of ECV but does not prevent AF recurrences.", 
    "786": "Long-term oral treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes and type 2 diabetes mellitus with beta-adrenoblockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with positive, though ambiguous changes in the left-ventricular structure and function. These changes should be the reason for choosing optimal therapy ensuring better prognosis in this patient population.", 
    "787": "1. Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is known to augment cardiac contractile activity and cause an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated cardiomyocytes. However, no information regarding the ATP-mediated signal transduction in the myocardium in congestive heart failure (CHF) is available. 2. CHF due to myocardial infarction (MI) in rats was induced by the occlusion of the left coronary artery for 8 weeks. The positive inotropy due to ATP was depressed in failing hearts. Treatment of 3 weeks infarcted animals with imidapril (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for a period of 5 weeks improved the left ventricle function and decreased the attenuation of inotropic response to ATP. 3. ATP-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was significantly depressed in cardiomyocytes isolated from the failing heart and this change was partially attenuated by imidapril treatment. However, the binding characteristics of (35)S-labeled adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate in sarcolemma isolated from the failing heart remained unaltered. 4. ATP-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was depressed by verapamil and cibacron blue in both control and failing heart cardiomyocytes; however, the ATP response in the failing hearts, unlike the control preparations, was not decreased by ryanodine. This insensitivity to ryanodine was attenuated by imidapril treatment. 5. Treatment of infarcted rats with enalapril and losartan produced effects similar to imidapril. 6. These findings indicate that the positive inotropic response to ATP and ATP-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in cardiomyocytes are impaired in heart failure. Furthermore, blockade of renin angiotensin system prevented the impairment of the ATP-mediated inotropic and [Ca(2+)](i) responses in the failing heart.", 
    "788": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key regulator of blood pressure. It is known to cleave small peptides, such as angiotensin I and bradykinin and changes their biological activities, leading to upregulation of blood pressure. Here we describe a new activity for ACE: a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein releasing activity (GPIase activity). Unlike its peptidase activity, GPIase activity is weakly inhibited by the tightly binding ACE inhibitor and not inactivated by substitutions of core amino acid residues for the peptidase activity, suggesting that the active site elements for GPIase differ from those for peptidase activity. ACE shed various GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, and the process was accelerated by the lipid raft disruptor filipin. The released products carried portions of the GPI anchor, indicating cleavage within the GPI moiety. Further analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry predicted the cleavage site at the mannose-mannose linkage. GPI-anchored proteins such as TESP5 and PH-20 were released from the sperm membrane of wild-type mice but not in Ace knockout sperm in vivo. Moreover, peptidase-inactivated E414D mutant ACE and also PI-PLC rescued the egg-binding deficiency of Ace knockout sperms, implying that ACE plays a crucial role in fertilization through this activity.",

    "791": "39 patients with type 2 diabetes age 34-75 years were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. The first group received PTX (400 mg three times a day) orally for a total of 2 months. The second group received captopril (25 mg three times a day) for 2 months. Response to treatment was assessed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after start of therapy.", 
    "792": "Captopril appeared to be equivalent in efficacy and safety to PTX. A significant decrease in proteinuria occurred in both groups. Of the 20 patients treated with PTX, the mean (SD) of 24 h urinary protein decreased from 1.4 (0.7) to 1.0 (0.7) g/24 h (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, in the 19 patients treated with captopril, the mean (SD) of 24 h urinary protein decreased from 1.3 (0.7) to 0.8 (0.7) g/24 h (p < 0.01).", 
    "793": "This study demonstrates that treatment with PTX and captopril both significantly reduce overt proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. This effect of ACE inhibition has previously been shown to slow progression to renal failure and we postulate that treatment with PTX may have a similar benefit.", 
    "794": "The two major outcome trials on the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists in heart failure are RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) and EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study). There have also been studies in essential hypertension, and in diabetic hypertensive patients, on the cardiac and renal effects of ACE inhibitors and MR antagonists, individually and in combination. In the clinical studies on heart failure, in outcome trials and the smaller studies using surrogate end points, a combination of ACE inhibition and MR blockade is superior to ACE inhibition alone, and in the hypertension studies to either agent alone. Some insight into their distinct sites of protective action may be gained from studies on experimental animal preparations. The principal caveat in the use of combination therapy is the possibility of hyperkalemia, which should be minimal in patients with creatine clearance greater than 30 mL/min and with the low doses of MR antagonist shown to be effective in outcome trials.",

The kidney biopsy in HSP shows IgA deposits and fish-oil therapy has proven to be promising in halting the progression of IgA nephropathy.", 
    "796": "Five children with biopsy-proven HSP with repeated episodes of haematuria and proteinuria were treated with fish oil (1 g orally twice daily). In three of the five patients an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) was added for hypertension.", 
    "797": "The mean duration of follow up after starting fish-oil therapy was 49.2 weeks. The protein excretion rate prior to starting fish oil was 1041 mg/day and on the last follow-up visit the rate had decreased to 104 mg/day (P <0.05). The average blood pressure (BP) prior to therapy was 135/82. On the last follow-up visit the average BP off ACEI had decreased to 100/54 (P <0.05). After a year of follow up serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rates have remained stable at 51.2 micromol/L and 128 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.", 
    "798": "This is the first report of abatement of HSP with fish oil and ACEI in children. There is a need for randomized prospective trials to confirm this observation.", 
    "799": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common complication of essential hypertension and an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, antihypertensive treatment should decrease blood pressure (BP) and reverse LVH. However, antihypertensive drugs have been shown to have different effects on LVH despite similar effects on BP reduction. Although lowering BP produces a beneficial effect on LVH per se, meta-analyses of clinical trials have indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease left ventricular mass (LVM) to a greater extent than do some other antihypertensives. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 24-week treatment with the ACE inhibitor moexipril (15 mg once daily) on the regression of LVH in hypertensive patients. This was a multicenter, international, single-blind, single-group, nonrandomized study. After a wash-out placebo period of 2 weeks, 15 mg moexipril once daily was administered for 24 weeks followed by a 2-week follow-up placebo period. Subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension were screened; those with LVH [defined as an LVM indexed for body surface area (LVMIs) >111 g/m in men and LVMIs >106 g/m in women] were eligible to participate in this study. Echocardiograms were recorded on videotape and sent to a centralized laboratory for reading by 2 independent experts blinded for treatment, center, and visit; the mean values of these readings were calculated and used for analysis. Valid echocardiographic data were obtained from 72 patients (50 males, 22 females) with a mean age of 49 +/- 11 years. Analysis showed significant decrease of LVMIs (121 +/- 20 versus 103 +/- 17 g/m; P < 0.001) and BP (152 +/- 12/96 +/- 9 versus 140 +/- 13/86 +/- 9 mm Hg; P < 0.001) with moexipril. For patients who met LVMI inclusion criteria after centralized, blinded readings, the decrease from baseline in LVMIs was 23.4 g/m. The decrease in LVMIs was independent from the regression to the mean phenomenon as observed from the follow-up placebo period. Moexipril 15 mg once daily administered for 24 weeks resulted in a significant reversal of LVH in patients with essential hypertension. The result compares favorably with results previously obtained in trials of similar duration with other ACE inhibitors.", 
    "800": "Circulating adhesion molecules may have a prognostic significance as markers of endothelial damage. Drugs which inhibit the renin-angiotensin system may be effective in reducing circulating or tissue adhesion molecules, albeit data available are scarce. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril and a highly selective angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, on circulating adhesion molecules in a large sample of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The study was comparative, multicenter, randomized and double blind, with two parallel groups.", 
    "801": "NIDDM patients with a diagnosis of mild (grade 1) essential hypertension were included in the study, at the end of a 2-week placebo run-in period. The primary end-point of the study was to evaluate changes of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) plasma levels during treatment. The secondary end-points were: changes in vascular cells adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) circulating levels and of urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) as well; 129 patients were randomized: 66 in the candesartan group and 63 in the enalapril group, 118 of them completed the scheduled 24-week treatment period.", 
    "802": "Candesartan and enalapril equally reduced circulating level of ICAM-1 and exerted comparable effects on changes of other adhesion molecules and coagulation factors. A similar blood pressure-lowering effect was observed with the two drugs (candesartan: from 148/90 +/- 11/8 to 132/82 +/- 12/7 mmHg, P < 0.01, enalapril: from 148/91 +/- 12/8 to 131/85 +/- 14/6 mmHg, P < 0.01). Candesartan was more effective than enalapril in the reduction of albuminuria (P < 0.05 between treatments), although urinary protein excretion can be considered normal in the majority of patients. The two drugs were comparable in terms of adverse events reported.",

We report the results of animal experiments performed in marmosets and rats in order to characterize aliskiren before its recent investigation in humans.", 
    "805": "The effects of aliskiren were investigated in sodium-depleted marmosets (oral dosing) and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (dosing via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps). Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured by radiotelemetry.", 
    "806": "In sodium-depleted marmosets, single oral doses of aliskiren (1-30 mg/kg) dose-dependently lowered BP. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, peak effects were observed 1 h after dosing (-30 +/- 4 mmHg, n = 6) and the response persisted for more than 12 h. A single oral dose of 3 mg/kg aliskiren was more effective than the same dose of either remikiren or zankiren, two orally active renin inhibitors previously tested in humans. Aliskiren (10 mg/kg) was at least as effective as equal doses of the AT1-receptor blocker valsartan or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, aliskiren dose-dependently (10-100 mg/kg per day) decreased BP. Aliskiren also potentiated the antihypertensive effects of low doses of valsartan or benazeprilat (1 or 3 mg/kg per day).", 
    "807": "Aliskiren is an orally effective, long-lasting renin inhibitor that shows antihypertensive efficacy in animals superior to previous renin inhibitors and at least equivalent to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1-receptor blockers. Aliskiren may therefore represent an effective, novel approach to the treatment of hypertension and related disorders, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.",

Collagen was stained with Sirius red, and mediators of inflammation were identified by immunolabeling (vascular cell adhesion molecule, nuclear factor-kappaB, infiltrating ED-1-positive macrophages and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) or by western blot (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1).", 
    "810": "Elevated systolic blood pressure of DOCA rats was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by omapatrilat and CGS 25462. Omapatrilat and CGS 25462 significantly (P < 0.05) decreased interstitial collagen density in the left ventricle of DOCA rats compared with untreated DOCA rats. Enalapril only decreased the subepicardial collagen of DOCA rats. Omapatrilat significantly (P < 0.05) decreased renal mesangial collagen deposition in DOCA rats. Cardiac and renal expression of surface adhesion molecules, nuclear factor-kappaB, monocyte chemotactic protein and ED-1-positive cells were decreased in omapatrilat-treated DOCA rats compared with untreated DOCA rats. Enalapril and CGS 25462 did not alter mesangial collagen of DOCA rats.", 
    "811": "Dual ACE/NEP inhibition was more effective than ACE or NEP inhibition in decreasing inflammatory mediators, and improving cardiac and renal fibrosis. This suggests a role for NEP inhibition added to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system that may explain the greater efficacy of omapatrilat.",

Previous studies revealed the effects of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) on the synthesis and degradation of collagens in the other phenotype of heart failure, systolic heart failure, which has a different pathophysiology; however, little is known about their effects in DHF.",

Six Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed on normal chow served as controls. Data were collected when animals were aged 20 weeks.", 
    "815": "The administration of an ARB or an ACEI inhibited ventricular fibrosis to the same degree. The ACEI decreased the level of type I collagen mRNA, but the decrease was less than that induced by the ARB. The difference in collagen synthesis was probably cancelled out by that in degradation: both in-vitro and in-situ zymography showed that gelatinase activity was greater in the rats treated with the ACEI than in those treated with the ARB.",

Cxs 37 and 43 were also reduced in the media. These differences were not apparent in pre-hypertensive SHR. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in SHR decreased blood pressure and restored Cx expression in the endothelium of both aorta and caudal artery. The decreased endothelial cell size in the caudal artery or the reduced Cxs in the media of the aorta of SHR were unaffected by ACE inhibition.", 
    "819": "We conclude that cellular coupling is reduced in the endothelium of arteries of SHR, but this can be restored by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.

    "821": "The significance of CRP and inflammation has increased over time, especially in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. From a simple marker it now appears that CRP is an active participant in pro-atherosclerotic phenomenon including local pro-inflammatory and thrombotic events. Studies in the general population indicate the usefulness of CRP in prognostication and in monitoring response to therapy. The clinical usefulness of CRP monitoring in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and especially in ESRD deserves closer study. In the meantime, the utility of CRP measurements for monitoring and treatment is on a case-by-case basis. Management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors should be considered. In the interest of optimizing therapy it is prudent to use biocompatible membranes and ultrapure water. A careful search for infectious processes in dialysis patients is recommended, with special attention to vascular access sites, periodontitis, gastritis, and other potentially chronic or covert infections. ACE-inhibitor use should be maximized in all eligible CKD patients. The data on the use of statins in ESRD have been generally positive but await further validation. Individualized use for selected patients is probably beneficial.",

The use of special care unit admissions, coronary artery diagnostic services (cardiac catheterization), and revascularization procedures (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stenting, coronary artery bypass surgery) peaked in the 50-to 64-year age group and decreased with increasing age. Specialist/sub-specialist care, prescriptions of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers decreased with age in seniors. Adjusted in-hospital, 1-year mortality and crude, age-specific 5-year mortality were significantly greater in those 75 years and older.

However, 3- to 10-fold differences existed among hospitals in the proportion of patients treated with intravenous beta-blockers, intravenous nitroglycerin, intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulants, and lipid-lowering medication, and even larger discrepancies in echocardiography and revascularization within 14 days. There was a strong (r = 0.69, P < .001) correlation between hospital activity index between the years and a correlation between the hospital's activity index and 1-year mortality (r = -0.30, P = .014).

Aspirin, beta-blockers, thrombolytic therapy, statins and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were prescribed less, while calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were prescribed more often to elderly patients. Unfractionated heparin was prescribed more often in young patients, while low-molecular-weight heparins were similarly prescribed across all age groups.

In rats with isoproterenol alone, the myocardium necrosis occurred and the cardiac function was inhibited; the BNP contents in plasma and myocardium were upregulated, so did the myocardial corin mRNA level; the NEP activity in plasma and myocardium were downregulated. Omapatrilat (OMA) treatment relieved myocardial lesions and improved cardiac function. In the plasma and myocardium, omapatrilat treatment increased BNP contents, reduced NEP activity; in myocardium, mRNA level of proBNP and corin decreased, but NEP mRNA expression increased. Our study confirmed that omapatrilat treated myocardial necrosis effectively and suggested that increased BNP in rats with myocardial necrosis could depend on increased production and conversion as well as decreased degradation.",

Once established in adults, food allergy is rarely cured. Factors favoring the acquisition of allergy could be sensitization to pollens, occupational sensitization by inhalation, drugs (such as tacrolimus), and sudden dietary changes. Severe anaphylaxis and oral allergy syndrome are frequent. The fatality risk is estimated at 1% in severe anaphylaxis. Risk factors for severe anaphylaxis are agents causing increased intestinal permeability, such as alcohol and aspirin. b-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and exercise are other factors. Gastrointestinal food allergy remains, to a large extent, undiagnosed in adults. Food allergens are mainly fruit and vegetable, related to pollen sensitizations, or to latex allergy. Wheat flour allergy is increasing. The diagnosis relies on prick skin tests, detection of specific IgEs, and standardized oral challenges. Strict avoidance diets are necessary. Specific immunotherapy to pollens may be efficient for cross-reactive food allergies.",

Inhibition of ET-1 activation by the endothelin-converting enzymes 1(a)(-)(d) (ECE-1(a)(-)(d); EC 3.4.24.71) represents another approach to block the ET-1 effect in cancer. To evaluate this potential, we synthesized and characterized a series of low nanomolar nonpeptidic thiol-containing ECE-1 inhibitors, and evaluated their effect, as well as the effect of inhibitors for the related metalloproteases neprilysin (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1), on human glioblastoma cell growth. Only ECE-1 inhibitors inhibited DNA synthesis by human glioblastoma cells. Exogenous addition of ET-1 or bigET-1 to glioblastoma cells did not counterbalance the growth inhibition elicited by ECE-1 inhibitors, suggesting that ECE-1 inhibitors block the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells most likely via a mechanism not involving extracellular production of ET-1. This class of molecules may thus represent novel therapeutic agents for the potential treatment of human cancer.", 
    "842": "In the present study, we introduce a new class of organometallic compound, the Biphosphinic Palladacycle Complex [Pd (C2, N-S(-)(dmpa)(dppf)] Cl (BPC), as an angiotensin-I converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) with hematological regulation properties. When BPC was assayed as a competitive inhibitor over the hydrolysis of Abz-YRK (Dnp)-P-OH (Km = 7.0 microM), it showed a Kiapp = 0.2259 ng and a Ki value of 94.12 pg. Using murine long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) and clonal culture techniques, we also evaluated the capacity of this drug (1.18 microM) to module haematopoietic progenitor cells proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that BPC produces no toxicity to bone marrow cells, as determined by the unchanged cell number in the non-adherent layer at weeks 1, 2, and 8 and the increased number of adherent cells present in the BPC-treated LTBMCs. However, the proportion of CFU-Cs in the non-adherent cell layer was reduced at weeks 5, 6, 8, and 9. In vivo studies using the dose of 1 mg/kg of BPC, administered by subcutaneous route, presented similar result as those found in vitro, in the number of CFU-Cs. This latter finding may be explained by the inhibitory effects of this drug on the ACE activity, which probably result in increased levels of its substrate AcSDKP, a negative regulator of hematopoiesis.",

The separation of the rotational cis-trans isomeric drug has been performed in an aqueous 50 mM borate buffer at pH 9.3. Interconversion profiles featuring plateau formation, peak-broadening, and peak coalescence were observed. To determine the rate constants of the forward and backward reaction (k(cis-->trans) and k(trans-->cis)) of the isomerization process in dynamic capillary electrophoresis, a novel straightforward calculation method using the experimental parameters plateau height, h(plateau), peak width at half height w(h), the total migration times of the cis-trans isomers t(R) and the electroosmotic break-through time t(0) as well as the peak ratio of the cis-trans isomers is presented for the first time. From temperature dependent measurements the rate constants k(cis-->trans) and k(trans-->cis) and the kinetic activation parameters DeltaG( not equal), DeltaH( not equal), and DeltaS( not equal) of the cis-trans isomerization of captopril were obtained. From the activation parameters the isomerization barriers of captopril at 37 degrees C under basic conditions were calculated to be DeltaG( not equal) (cis-->trans) = 90.3 kJ.mol(-1)and DeltaG( not equal) (trans-->cis) = 90.0 kJ.mol(-1*).",

    "855": "We examined the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), captopril, on cerebral arterioles in young and old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF, arbitrary units) and cerebral arteriolar internal diameter (ID, mum) prior to and during stepwise hypotension (SH) in 6- (WKY-6) and 15-month-old (WKY-15) Wistar Kyoto rats and in age-matched SHR that were untreated (SHR-6 and SHR-15) or treated for 3 months with captopril (SHR-6C, 105+/-2 mg kg(-1) day(-1) and SHR-15C, 94+/-1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). ID and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (CSA) were measured in deactivated (EDTA) cerebral arterioles during a second SH. Captopril decreased the lower limit of CBF autoregulation (61+/-6 in SHR-6C and 51+/-2 in SHR-15C vs 52+/-6 in WKY-6 and 62+/-7 in WKY-15 and 83+/-14 mmHg in SHR-6 and 120+/-19 mmHg in SHR-15; P<0.05) and CSA (510+/-21 in SHR-6C and 585+/-25 in SHR-15C vs 529+/-12 in WKY-6 and 549+/-20 in WKY-15 and 644+/-38 mmHg in SHR-6 and 704+/-38 mmHg in SHR-15; P<0.05).

Captopril attenuated increases in cerebral arteriolar distensibility in young SHR. Thus, ACEIs attenuate eutrophic and hypertrophic inward remodeling of cerebral arterioles in young and old SHR, thus decreasing the lower limit of CBF autoregulation.", 
    "856": "This study aims to test the hypothesis that in some hypertensive subjects the blood pressure (BP) response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition differs from that to angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB); a responder to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may not respond to ARB or the opposite. A randomized, open-label, crossover, comparative trial of lisinopril 20 mg compared with telmisartan 80 mg (5 weeks per treatment period) was conducted in 32 untreated hypertensives using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Subjects were classified as \"responders\" and \"nonresponders\" using an arbitrary threshold of ambulatory BP response (> or =10 mm Hg systolic or > or =5 diastolic) or the median response achieved by each drug. No difference was detected between the drugs in their effect on ambulatory BP (mean difference 1.2+/-7.1/0.7+/-5.1 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic). Significant correlations were found between the antihypertensive responses to the two drugs (r=0.77, p<0.001). Using the arbitrary response criterion, there was a difference between the drugs in the responses in 28%/13% of subjects (9/4 patients) for systolic/diastolic BP (19%/25% using the median response criterion). These data suggest that in some hypertensive patients the BP response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may fail to predict the response to ARB. It appears that there are differences in the antihypertensive action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs that may be clinically important.", 
    "857": "Many physicians are reluctant to lower blood pressure to recommended levels in elderly hypertensive patients because of concern about producing cerebral hypoperfusion. Because hypertension is associated with potentially reversible structural and functional alterations in the cerebral circulation that may improve with treatment, we investigated whether long-term pharmacological reduction of systolic blood pressure will improve, rather than worsen, cerebral blood flow and its regulation. Three groups of elderly subjects 65 years of age or older were studied prospectively: normotensive subjects (N=19), treated hypertensive subjects with systolic pressure <140 mm Hg (N=18), and uncontrolled hypertensive subjects with systolic pressure >160 mm Hg at entry into the study (N=14). We measured beat-to-beat blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler ultrasonography), finger arterial pressure (photoplethysmography), and pulsatile distensibility of the carotid artery (duplex Doppler ultrasonography) at baseline and after 6 months of observation or antihypertensive therapy. After baseline hemodynamic measurements, uncontrolled hypertensive subjects underwent aggressive treatment with lisinopril with or without hydroclorothiazide or, if not tolerated, nifedipine or an angiotensin receptor blocker to bring their systolic pressure <140 mm Hg for 6 months. The other 2 groups were observed for 6 months. After 6 months of successful treatment, uncontrolled hypertensive subjects had significant increases in cerebral blood flow velocity and carotid distensibility that was not seen in the other groups. Treatment reduced cerebrovascular resistance and did not impair cerebral autoregulation. Therefore, judicious long-term treatment of systolic hypertension in otherwise healthy elderly subjects does not cause cerebral hypoperfusion.",

We identified RCTs with > or =100 enrolled patients that examined the impact of cardiac medical therapy on outcomes > or =1 year after CABG. The MEDLINE database was searched for trials conducted between 1966 and 2004 on the following medications: aspirin, antilipid agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), nitrates, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Both aspirin and antilipid agents were found to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis and the occurrence of graft occlusion. Cardiovascular events were decreased with antilipid agents. In small trials, beta-blockers and CCBs failed to decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events. No RCTs examined nitrates, and one small RCT documented a reduction in cardiovascular events among patients treated with ACE inhibitors. We conclude that few RCTs have examined the efficacy of cardiac medical therapy in post-CABG patients. Based on current RCT evidence, aspirin and antilipid agents should be used routinely after CABG. However, current data do not support the use of beta-blockers, CCBs, and nitrates, and more evidence is needed regarding the use of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "871": "Zofenopril, a new potent sulphydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is characterized by high lipophilicity, selective cardiac ACE inhibition, and antioxidant and tissue protective activities. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that zofenopril exerts antioxidant properties at clinically achievable tissue concentrations. In endothelial cells, zofenopril enhances nitric oxide production, attenuates atherosclerotic lesion development and inhibits adhesion molecule expression by reducing reactive oxygen species. These peculiar characteristics are reflected in the drug's cardioprotective activity, which has been shown to be greater than that of non-sulphydryl ACE inhibitors. Cardiac hypertrophy was also reduced by chronic zofenopril administration, independently of its blood pressure-reducing effect. ACE inhibitors with a sulphydryl group could have an advantage in improving vascular function and reducing cardiac impairment compared with non-sulphydryl-containing ACE inhibitors. This could explain zofenopril's remarkable clinical efficacy post-infarction, and potentially beneficial use in prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis and heart failure.",

Patients with chronic renal diseases usually present with conditions (inflammation, oxidative stress) that can induce quantitative and qualitative changes in lipoprotein composition, making these particles more atherogenic. Several large randomized trials have shown that lowering cholesterol with statins reduces coronary mortality and morbidity across a wide range of cholesterol levels. Moreover, statins ameliorated renal function and structure in experimental models of progressive renal disease as well as in patients with proteinuric disease. It has been hypothesized that statins may directly modulate intracellular signaling systems involved in cellular proliferation, inflammatory, and fibrogenic responses. In addition, studies in animals have shown that the mevalonate pathway also may be involved in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system, providing the rationale for the use of statins in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, 2 classes of drugs that have evidenced beneficial effects in different forms of renal diseases. Preliminary studies have shown that a multidrug approach may induce remission of proteinuria, lessen renal injury, and protect from loss of function in those patients whose condition does not fully respond to a single treatment.",

A total of 70 hypertensive type II diabetic individuals were treated with three antihypertensive strategies in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy design. Blood pressure was titrated to levels below 130/85 mmHg or a decrease in systolic pressure of 10% with a diastolic pressure below 85 mmHg. After titration, patients were treated for 12 months. Mean blood pressures changed from 157/93, 151/94 and 149/93 at baseline to 135/80, 135/82 and 131/80 mmHg after titration in the hydrochlorothiazide (n=24), candesartan (n=24) and lisinopril (n=22) groups. About 70% reached target blood pressures. However, only 45% had blood pressures <130/85 mmHg. Urinary albumin excretion and levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 decreased (GEE regression coefficients, -2.40 mg/24 h (P<0.001), -85 ng/ml (P=0.01) and -50 ng/ml (P=0.02)), but brachial artery endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation and levels of von Willebrand factor and C-reactive protein did not change (GEE regression coefficients, 0.21 mm (P=0.07), 0.04 mm (P=0.43), 0.04 IU/ml (P=0.33) and -1.15 mg/l (P=0.64)). No differences in outcome variables between treatment groups were observed. These data show that achievement of target blood pressures below 130/85 mmHg in hypertensive type II diabetes is difficult. Aggressive antihypertensive therapy can improve urinary albumin excretion, endothelial function and inflammatory activity in hypertensive type II diabetic individuals, regardless of the type of antihypertensive therapy used.", 
    "879": "Whereas the diurnal fall of BP (dipping) is an important prognostic marker in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), the integrity of physiologic ultradian (i.e., shorter than 24 h) cardiovascular rhythms in patients with CRF is unknown. Also, the relationship between conventional dipping analysis and Fourier spectral rhythm analysis has not been examined in renal hypertension. The prevalence and dimensions of the circadian and three ultradian (12, 8, and 6 h) cardiovascular rhythms were studied by ambulatory BP monitoring in 214 children (aged 3 to 18 yr) with CRF (stage 2 to 4 chronic kidney disease) and no antihypertensive treatment compared with 938 healthy control subjects, and the relationship of rhythm characteristics to conventional dipping parameters, renal function, proteinuria, and serum electrolytes was assessed. The CRF cohort exhibited significantly reduced amplitudes of the circadian and all ultradian cardiovascular rhythms studied (all P < 0.01). Moreover, all BP and most heart rate rhythms showed significantly delayed acrophases (time of peak; P < 0.01). Whereas conventional BP dipping parameters (day/night difference, day/night ratio) and the 24-h BP amplitude were independent of renal function, the 8-h BP amplitude was positively correlated with GFR (r = 0.3, P = 0.01) and inversely correlated with the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (r = -0.27, P < 0.05), and the 6-h BP amplitude was inversely correlated with proteinuria (r = -0.3, P < 0.02). Children who displayed 24- or 12-h cardiovascular rhythms had significantly lower serum calcium levels than children without these rhythms. In summary, children with CRF display not only blunted circadian but also blunted ultradian cardiovascular rhythms. Ultradian but not circadian rhythms or conventional dipping parameters are quantitatively associated with renal function and proteinuria.", 
    "880": "Whether temporary angiotensin II (AngII) blockade at the prediabetic stage attenuates renal injury in type 2 diabetic OLETF rats later in life was investigated. OLETF rats were treated with an AT(1) receptor antagonist (olmesartan, 0.01% in food), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (temocapril, 0.01% in food), a combination of the two, or hydralazine (25 mg/kg per d) at the prediabetic stage (4 to 11 wk of age) and then monitored without further treatment until 50 wk of age. At 11 wk of age, blood glucose levels and urinary protein excretion (U(protein)V) were similar between OLETF and control LETO rats. However, OLETF rats showed higher kidney AngII contents and type IV collagen mRNA expression than LETO rats at this age. These decreased with olmesartan, temocapril, and a combination of these but not with hydralazine. At 50 wk of age, diabetic OLETF rats showed higher BP, U(protein)V, and intrarenal AngII levels than LETO rats. Temporary AngII blockade did not affect glucose metabolism or the development of hypertension in OLETF rats but significantly suppressed proteinuria and ameliorated glomerular injury. However, no parameters were affected by temporary hydralazine treatment. The present study demonstrated that intrarenal AngII and type IV collagen expression are already augmented long before diabetes becomes apparent in OLETF rats. Furthermore, temporary AngII blockade at the prediabetic stage attenuates the progression of renal injury in these animals. These data suggest that early AngII blockade could be an effective strategy for preventing the development of type 2 diabetic renal injury later in life.", 
    "881": "For further improvement of coronary heart disease (CHD) management large epidemiological studies are required to characterise the real population of patients with CHD, treated in the primary care settings, and to evaluate how the guidelines are implemented in the everyday clinical practice. The aim of the Angina Treatment Pattern (ATP) survey was to characterise (i) the population of patients, treated by the primary care physicians for stable CHD, (ii) the methods applied by the primary care physicians to establish diagnosis of CHD and (iii) the pharmacological therapies for CHD. Across Poland, 397 primary care physicians were randomly selected. They recruited 7420 patients (49% men; mean age, 62 +/- 10 years; range: 25-93 years), treated for stable CHD. The duration of CHD was 7.4 +/- 6.6 years (range: 6 months-50 years), 2750 (37%) patients had myocardial infarction. The following risk factors of CHD were present: arterial hypertension in 58%, dyslipidaemia in 52%, smoking in 40%, family history of CHD in 56% and obesity or overweight in 73% of patients. Primary care physicians based a diagnosis of CHD predominantly on a history of anginal pain (in 33% patients), accompanied either by abnormal resting ECG or positive exercise test (in additional 31% patients). Only in 5% of patients, coronary angiography was applied to diagnose CAD. The following groups of drugs have been used: long-acting nitrates in 90%, anti-platelet drugs or anti-coagulants in 71% (aspirin in 65%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 51%, beta-blockers in 48%, calcium antagonists 31%, hypolipaemic drugs in 23% (statins in 10%) and metabolic agents in 16% of patients. Despite an extensive use of classical anti-anginal drugs (including at least one of the following: long-acting nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists in 95% of patients), 85% of patients still complained of anginal symptoms. Neither prevalence of angina among patients nor nitroglycerin intake depended on the number of anti-anginal drugs taken (monotherapy vs. combination therapy: 82% vs. 86% and 4.9 vs. 5.3 doses weekly, respectively). Among the primary care physicians, the methods used to establish a CHD diagnosis and the mode of CHD management are far from optimal. The results of the ATP study confirm the need for further intensification of activities to improve the process of diagnosis and management among patients with CHD, treated by the family doctors."
