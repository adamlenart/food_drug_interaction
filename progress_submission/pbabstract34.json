    "0": "Cardiovascular disease is prevalent in developed countries causing very large burdens to health services. The underlying pathology is atheromatous plaque in the sub-endothelial region of the vascular wall. High levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and high blood pressure cause endothelial damage. Atheroma develop from a response to this injury that is perpetuated to chronic inflammation. The invasion of inflammatory leukocytes into atheroma during its development and in the precipitation of acute thrombotic events is mediated by adhesion molecules on the cell surface. These are regulated by the actin filament cytoskeleton which also mediates intracellular signalling from them. The actin cytoskeleton is central to NADPH oxidase activation that produces superoxide which is an intracellular signalling molecule for the hypertensive and inflammatory actions of angiotensin II. There are polymorphisms in actin filament proteins such as adducin and caldesmon and in the promoter regions of tropomyosins that may cause individual variation in these processes. Many signalling molecules in the actin filament response to inflammatory stimuli and in signalling downstream from actin filaments are small G-proteins that require post-transcriptional modification by isoprenoids from the cholesterol synthetic pathway. Statins deplete the isoprenoids and so down regulate G-proteins that mediate the inflammatory response. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonists decrease angiotensin II stimulated superoxide production thus decreasing not only blood pressure but also inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs, involving altered actin filament function, are a major contributor to their benefits in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The feasibility of modifying the behaviour of actin filament proteins as a therapeutic approach for cardiovascular disease is considered.", 
    "1": "Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid primarily produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland. For many years, aldosterone (Aldo) was thought to have its sole site of action in the kidney, where it regulated sodium excretion and potassium reabsorption. It is now known that Aldo is produced in cardiovascular tissues, and has been implicated in the development of ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The precise mechanisms whereby Aldo acts in cardiac tissues are diverse. It was assumed that Aldo production could be limited by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, but serial measurements during therapy reveal only a transient decrease in Aldo levels. Moreover, the effects of Aldo on cardiac tissues occur even when angiotensin II (Ang II) has been suppressed or eliminated. Multiple investigators have examined effects of Aldo receptor blockade in human subjects and various animal models using the two Aldo receptor antagonists (ARAs), spironolactone and eplerenone. Major clinical trials involving spironolactone (RALES) and eplerenone (EPHESUS) ARAs have shown significant benefits in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). In RALES, patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV systolic heart failure treated with spironolactone had a 30% relative risk decrease in mortality. Although spironolactone is an effective competitive inhibitor of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), progestational and antiandrogenic side effects limit its use in some patients. Eplerenone, a more selective ARA, lacks these undesirable side effects. Although eplerenone is 20-fold less potent at the MR, it demonstrates efficacy similar to spironolactone, possibly due to decreased protein binding. Eplerenone has fewer side effects than spironolactone, which has been attributed to the low cross-reactivity with androgen and progesterone receptors. In EPHESUS, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction [Ejection Fraction (EF) <40%] and CHF following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), were treated with eplerenone, resulting in a 17% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. However, these studies were limited in that diastolic function was not evaluated, although approximately 1/2 of CHF is due to diastolic dysfunction alone. To date, neither ARA has been studied for the treatment of diastolic dysfunction in a major clinical trial. However, numerous animal studies employing ARAs have shown a decrease in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, indicating the potential benefits of these agents in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. In this review, we discuss possible underlying mechanisms responsible for Aldo effects on cardiovascular function and compare the beneficial effects of spironolactone and eplerenone in the treatment of heart disease.",

At every level of renal function haemoglobin levels were lower by an average of 10 g/l in subjects with diabetes than in those without. Likewise, anaemia was found to occur at an earlier stage of chronic kidney disease (and to be of greater severity) in diabetic patients. Independent predictors of haemoglobin included female sex, diabetes, renal function and serum albumin, with diabetes and renal function being the greatest predictors. Multiple logistic regression showed that patients with diabetes had an odds ratio of 4 for being anaemic. Had we used an estimated GFR of less than 60 ml/min to trigger investigation of anaemia, we would have detected 85% of anaemic patients.",

The results also confirm that in the patient with uncomplicated hypertension as well as in those patients with diabetes without nephropathy, initial therapy with 'newer therapies' (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers) are effective, but not more effective than thiazide diuretics, at reducing stroke, coronary heart disease, morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality.",

Despite a more favorable metabolic profile, alpha-blockers are less effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure and stroke. Calcium channel blockers produce a similar reduction in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease outcomes compared with thiazide-type diuretics, although they are consistently less effective in preventing heart failure. In the absence of heart failure or renal disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have shown little advantage in clinical trials over diuretics in preventing cardiovascular disease and are not indicated as an initial therapy in Blacks.",

The initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation is not only initiated by mechanical distension of the atria, but also by increased atrial expression of components of the renin-angiotensin-system, which initiate an inflammatory signal cascade and oxidative stress and in consequence myolysis and interstitial fibrosis. Ultimately, locally decreased conduction velocity and abbreviated refractory period facilitate reentry circuit(s) as an underlying pathomechanism of atrial fibrillation. In a meta-analysis, ACE inhibitors and AT (1) blockers, both reduce the relative risk of atrial fibrillation by about 30 %. Further prospective randomized clinical studies are required to establish final evidence.",

Our retrospective Tokai Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (TAMIS) indicated that there were gender differences according to age groups; however, the exact nature of these gender differences remains unclear. Therefore, using data from TAMIS-II, we studied the influence of gender on the delivery of cardiac management according to 2 age groups (< 65, >or= 65). TAMIS-II is a prospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the 15 acute care hospitals in the Tokai region with the diagnosis of AMI from 2001 to 2003. A total of 169 younger women, 1246 younger men, 616 older women, and 1240 older men were included. Data on patient demographics, in-hospital course, comorbid conditions, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound-echocardiogram (UCG), treadmill test (TMT), coronary angiography (CAG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital or discharge medications (thrombolytics, vasopressors, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, nitrates) were collected. After controlling for these baseline variables, only lipid-lowering therapy tended to be more frequent in women than in men among the elderly (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.00-2.38).

Keto-ACE, a previously described C-domain selective ACE inhibitor, was used as the basis for the design, synthesis and molecular modelling of a series of novel ketomethylene derivatives for which ACE inhibition profiles and structural characterisation are reported. Ki determinations indicated that the introduction of a bulky aromatic tryptophan at the P2' position of keto-ACE significantly increased selectivity for the C-domain, while an aliphatic P2 Boc group conferred N-domain selectivity. These data were supported by the potential energies of the compounds docked with the C- and N-domains of ACE.", 
    "32": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in cardiovascular pathophysiology, consists of two homologous domains (N and C), each bearing a Zn-dependent active site. We modeled the 3D-structure of the ACE N-domain using known structures of the C-domain of human ACE and the ACE homologue, ACE2, as templates. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAb), 3A5 and i2H5, developed against the human N-domain of ACE, demonstrated anticatalytic activity. N-domain modeling and mutagenesis of 21 amino acid residues allowed us to define the epitopes for these mAbs. Their epitopes partially overlap: amino acid residues K407, E403, Y521, E522, G523, P524, D529 are present in both epitopes. Mutation of 4 amino acid residues within the 3A5 epitope, N203E, R550A, D558L, and K557Q, increased the apparent binding of mAb 3A5 with the mutated N-domain 3-fold in plate precipitation assay, but abolished the inhibitory potency of this mAb. Moreover, mutation D558L dramatically decreased 3A5-induced ACE shedding from the surface of CHO cells expressing human somatic ACE. The inhibition of N-domain activity by mAbs 3A5 and i2H5 obeys similar kinetics. Both mAbs can bind to the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex, forming E.mAb and E.S.mAb complexes, respectively; however, only complex E.S can form a product. Kinetic analysis indicates that both mAbs bind better with the ACE N-domain in the presence of a substrate, which, in turn, implies that binding of a substrate causes conformational adjustments in the N-domain structure. Independent experiments with ELISA demonstrated better binding of mAbs 3A5 and i2H5 in the presence of the inhibitor lisinopril as well. This effect can be attributed to better binding of both mAbs with the \"closed\" conformation of ACE, therefore, disturbing the hinge-bending movement of the enzyme, which is necessary for catalysis.", 
    "33": "(1) Heart failure is diagnosed on the basis of both clinical symptoms and evaluation of cardiac function (preferably measured by echocardiography). Left ventricular dysfunction is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 40%. The drugs of choice for chronic heart failure are certain angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, some diuretics, some betablockers, and spironolactone. In one trial, spironolactone greatly reduced mortality at 24 months (35%, compared with 46% on placebo, p <0.001). (2) Eplerenone, a spironolactone derivative, is marketed for the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction in heart failure patients with recent myocardial infarction. (3) The EPHESUS study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 6632 patients, showed a significant reduction in the overall mortality rate among patients with heart failure and recent myocardial infarction treated with eplerenone for 16 months (16.7% versus 14.4%; p = 0.008). This improvement was mainly due to a reduction in mortality during the first month of treatment. Eplerenone has not been compared with spironolactone, although the latter was known to be effective before the EPHESUS trial was conducted. (4) Severe hyperkalemia is frequent with eplerenone, occurring in 5.5% of patients. The risk of hyperkalaemia increases with renal failure and co-administration of potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. (5) In the short term, the incidence of gynecomastia in patients taking eplerenone seems to be low. (6) In patients who develop heart failure after myocardial infarction, an indirect comparison of available data favours spironolactone over eplerenone (better efficacy, lower risk of hyperkalemia). (7) In France, treatment with eplerenone is about 9 times more expensive than spironolactone. (8) Spironolactone remains the treatment of choice for patients with heart failure and incapacitating dyspnea despite ACE inhibitor and diuretic therapy. Eplerenone may possibly be useful for patients who have non severe heart failure after recent myocardial infarction.",

    "52": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has become crucial in the management of type 1 (insulin-dependent) and type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, especially in patients who are at risk of nephropathy. In this review, we address the issue of why the renin system and its blockade are so important. As in many complex processes, diabetic nephropathy reflects an interaction between genetic factors and environmental factors. Recent research has uncovered a number of environmental factors; control of these factors should contribute to improved management. The renin system is important in patients with diabetes mellitus because so many relevant factors converge on the intrarenal renin system.", 
    "53": "Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by both functional and morphological changes in the retinal microvessels that can lead to macular edema, neovascularization, and vision loss. Hypertension has been identified as a major risk factor for diabetic retinopathy and randomized clinical trials have shown that reduction of blood pressure using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces the progression of diabetic retinopathy. The major components of the renin-angiotensin system have been identified in ocular tissues. Activation of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors expressed on retinal endothelial cells and pericytes has been implicated in contributing to the microvascular abnormalities in diabetic retinopathy. We have examined the experimental and clinical evidence for the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, including the effects of ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor antagonism on diabetes-induced abnormalities in retinal hemodynamics, vascular permeability, and leukostasis; retinal neovascularization in rodent models of oxygen-induced retinopathy; and results from randomized clinical trials that have investigated the effects of ACE inhibitors on the progression of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients in the absence or presence of hypertension. The effects of AT1-receptor antagonism on the retina have been attributed to decreases in systemic blood pressure and the concomitant reduction in mechanical vascular stretch, in addition to the intraocular effects blocking AT1-receptor stimulation of retinal endothelial cells and pericytes. Results from the current DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials program will evaluate the potential of the AT1-receptor as a therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "54": "Patients with essential hypertension are at increased risk of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes. Recent large studies have been unable to delineate any superiority in one class of antihypertensive drug over another, independent of their effects in reducing blood pressure; however, in the longer term, antihypertensive agents that are able to reduce the risk of diabetes may have a theoretical advantage. To this end, the findings of several recent clinical trials have suggested that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may protect against the development of de-novo diabetes in 'at risk' patients. This beneficial effect appears to outweigh both the adverse metabolic effects of agents used in the control arm of these studies and the control of blood pressure achieved. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the RAS may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Angiotensin-mediated increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and free fatty acids concentrations potentially contribute to beta-cell dysfunction in diabetes. In addition, activation of the RAS appears to potentiate the action of other pathogenic pathways, including glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and advanced glycation. In experimental models of type 2 diabetes, blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists also results in the improvement of islet structure and function. At least three large controlled trials are currently under way to study the utility of blockade of the RAS in the development of diabetes, including studies of combination therapy. It is hoped that these studies will demonstrate the true potential of blockade of the RAS for the prevention of diabetes.",

First it will examine the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of angiotensin-sympathetic crosstalk discussing possible sites, mechanisms and effects of the interaction.

    "58": "The important role of the endothelium for regulation of vascular tone, growth, inflammatory response, coagulation and thrombocyte adhesion has now been recognized. Endothelial function has largely been assessed as endothelium-dependent vasodilation, assuming that endothelium-dependent vasomotion represents a surrogate marker for other important endothelial functions. An important rational for this approach has been the observation that both endothelium-dependent vasomotion and other protective endothelial functions are at least partially mediated by nitric oxide. Accumulating clinical studies have now demonstrated a close and independent association of impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation with cardiovascular events and prognosis. These findings have stimulated interest in treatment options to improve endothelial function in patients at high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "59": "This article describes recent insights into endothelial effects of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade, which have both been shown to improve endothelial function (i.e. by increasing endothelial nitric oxide availability via bradykinin-dependent endothelial nitric oxide release). ACE has a high affinity for bradykinin and degrades the peptide, so ACE inhibition may increase bradykinin-dependent effects by preventing bradykinin degradation. Interestingly, AT1-receptor blockade appears to stimulate the bradykinin-nitric oxide pathway by increased angiotensin II type 2 receptor activation. Moreover, both treatment strategies prevent increased inactivation of endothelial nitric oxide by oxygen radicals, by reducing AT1-receptor-dependent activation of the oxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase and increasing the activity of the vascular antioxidant enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase. These beneficial effects of ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade are likely to contribute to their effects on cardiovascular events.", 
    "60": "Randomized clinical trials in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have demonstrated the life-saving and symptomatic benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and, in more selected patients, spironolactone. Despite these major advancements, the prevalence of heart failure continues to increase mainly as a consequence of aging populations. The development of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) provides a pharmacologically distinct mechanism of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ARBs offer the potential to produce further clinical improvements for patients with heart failure above and beyond ACE inhibitors, as well as an alternative for those intolerant to an ACE inhibitor.",

    "64": "Migraine is a common episodic headache that predominantly affects young adults, particularly women in their most productive years. Many of the prophylactic agents available today have side-effects that are not compatible with long-term use. The discovery that drugs influencing the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which have few side-effects, were effective in some patients with migraine led to several studies investigating a possible link between the angiotensin system and migraine pathophysiology. Clinical trials indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. These findings are further supported by pharmacoepidemiological, genetic, and physiological studies. In addition, it is known that the RAS has neurophysiological, chemical, and immunological effects that are of relevance in migraine pathophysiology. On the basis of evidence presented in this review, we find it likely that the RAS has a clinically important role in migraine pathophysiology. The effect of ARBs and ACEIs on migraine is probably not attributable to their effect on blood pressure. The RAS has several actions that may be relevant in migraine pathophysiology, but the reason for the prophylactic effect of ARBs/ACEIs in migraine remains a matter of speculation.", 
    "65": "Stroke is a burden of modern civilization, causing death and disability. Nowadays it is universally accepted that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs) can effectively decrease the incidence of stroke in patients at risk. Here, we summarize current knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms of the beneficial effects of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in stroke, with an emphasis on mechanisms beyond blood pressure reduction; in particular, neuroprotection. All major clinical studies comparing the effectiveness of ARBs with placebo or other blood pressure decreasing drugs in stroke are mentioned and commented on. These clinical data are complemented by data from a selection of animal experiments pivotal for the understanding of neuroprotective actions of ARBs. Clinical studies have shown that ARBs can be superior to other antihypertensive drugs in the prevention of stroke, even if there are no differences in blood pressures. Findings from animal experiments suggest that the underlying mechanisms include not just inhibition of the detrimental peripheral and central actions of angiotensin II mediated by AT1-receptors, but also stimulation of unopposed angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors that are upregulated in the area of ischaemia. ARBs have been proven to be effective in the prevention of stroke via mechanisms that are both dependent on and independent of the antihypertensive abilities of the drugs.", 
    "66": "Despite the renoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), many patients with chronic kidney disease develop end-stage kidney disease. Combination treatment with an ACEI and an ARB is a recently introduced approach to obtain more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, based on the different mechanisms of action of the two classes of drug. To assess the shortcomings of single treatment with ACEIs and ARBs, and the potential benefits of combination treatment, we reviewed the experimental and clinical evidence suggesting that combination treatment offers more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and identified areas in which further research is necessary to confirm the benefits of combination treatment. The available data suggest that combination treatment with an ACEI and an ARB has a greater renoprotective effect than either drug alone. In addition, more recent data have shown that combination treatment is more potent in suppressing renal fibrosis, and is well tolerated in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Clinical trials with rigorous endpoints are needed to further establish the benefits of combination treatment in renal protection.", 
    "67": "Clinical trials have shown that effective control of blood pressure reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. For example, data from the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) study show significant reductions in the incidence of cardiac events, stroke and all-cause mortality in patients in whom blood pressure control was achieved compared with those in whom blood pressure remained uncontrolled. Although the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) demonstrated no significant difference in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity between patients receiving diuretics, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, this finding might have been confounded by differences in the blood pressure reductions achieved with the three treatments. Other studies have consistently shown that newer antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, reduce cardiovascular events to a similar, or possibly greater, extent as older therapies, such as diuretics and beta-blockers. In particular, ACE inhibitors appear to offer additional benefits beyond blood pressure reduction in terms of reducing cardiovascular events and producing renoprotective effects. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been less extensively studied, but there is evidence already that they have heart failure, stroke and renoprotective benefits. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) is currently comparing the effects of the ARB telmisartan 80 mg and the ACE inhibitor ramipril 10 mg, alone and in combination, on cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.", 
    "68": "Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired nitric oxide activity, constitutes an early step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease. Prospective studies have shown that impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and the vasodilatory response of coronary arteries to acetylcholine predict cardiovascular events. Microalbuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate, which are both deeply influenced by renal nitric oxide activity, are predictors of cardiovascular outcome and total mortality but develop at a later stage of renal impairment. Endothelial dysfunction reflects early stage renal involvement in the atherosclerotic processes. The Telmisartan versus Ramipril in renal ENdothelium DYsfunction (TRENDY) trial examined endothelial function of the renal vasculature as a therapeutic target in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, but without albuminuria. The rationale was that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is cardio- and renoprotective at later stages of the disease, but the impact of blockade of the RAS at earlier stages of disease is unknown. The results of TRENDY indicate that the endothelial function, as assessed by basal nitric oxide activity, can be improved after RAS blockade. These data complement the results of the Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan And enalaprIL (DETAIL) trial, which demonstrated that telmisartan and enalapril similarly decelerate the progression of overt diabetic nephropathy. The results of TRENDY are in accordance with the observed changes in peripheral circulation. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation could be improved with angiotensin II receptor blockers, but not with diuretics or beta-blockers, in hypertensive patients. Intervention at the beginning of the renal and cardiovascular continuum offers the opportunity to prevent the fatal development towards renal and cardiac failure.", 
    "69": "Incidences of potentially life-threatening cardiovascular events display a diurnal pattern, tending to be higher in the morning than at other times of day. The recording of blood pressure at pre-defined intervals under everyday circumstances is facilitated by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). This technique shows that systolic and diastolic blood pressures display a circadian rhythm in most individuals. Typically, at the end of the night on arousal, blood pressure surges. This surge coincides with increased cardiovascular events. A recent prospective study conducted in Japan, where the incidence of stroke is high, provides further evidence for the link between cardiovascular events and morning blood pressure surge. Prevalence of both silent ischaemic events and multiple cerebrovascular infarcts was highest among the elderly subjects studied, with the largest increase in blood pressure on awakening. An increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is also seen in 'non-dippers' (i.e. individuals in whom the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or blunted). ABPM is superior to clinic blood pressure in predicting cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and this suggests that 24-h blood pressure control may be necessary to gain complete benefit from blood pressure-lowering therapy. Antihypertensive agents with a long duration of action have the potential to provide blood pressure control throughout the dosing interval and thus cover the critical early morning period when the blood pressure surges. Clinical studies that have compared telmisartan with shorter-acting angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors demonstrate that telmisartan has a sustained duration of action, with proven efficacy over the entire 24-h period between doses, including the critical early morning period.", 
    "70": "We examined whether ANG II receptors in the central nervous system mediate hemodynamic responses to pharmacological (cocaine) and behavioral (cold water) stressors. After administration of cocaine (5 mg/kg iv), rats were classified as vascular responders (VR) if their pressor response was due entirely to an increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) despite a decrease in cardiac output (CO). Cocaine elicited a pressor response in mixed responders (MR) that was dependent on small increases in both SVR and CO. ANG II (30 ng/5 microl icv, 5 min before cocaine) augmented the decrease in CO in VR and prevented the increase in CO in MR. Administration of [Sar(1),Thr(8)]ANG II (20 microg/5 microl icv; sarthran) before cocaine attenuated the decrease in CO and the large increase in SVR in VR so that they were no longer different from MR. Losartan (20 microg icv) or captopril (50 microg icv) preceding cocaine administration also attenuated the decrease in CO and the large increase in SVR seen in VR only. The role of angiotensin was not specific for cocaine, because ANG II (icv) pretreatment before startle with cold water (1 cm deep) enhanced the decrease in CO and the increase in SVR in both MR and VR, whereas losartan (icv) pretreatment before startle attenuated the decrease in CO and the increase in SVR in VR so that they were no longer different from MR. These data suggest that central ANG II receptors mediate the greater vascular and cardiac responsiveness in vascular responders to acute pharmacological and behavioral stressors.",

    "73": "We found transcripts of most of RAS components in our microarray database, and confirmed their expression by qRT-PCR. Angiotensinogen (Aogen), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and AT1 receptors were localized to the endothelium. There was no evidence of AT2 receptor localization in the microvascular endothelium. In SHR, (pro)renin receptor mRNA and AT1 receptor mRNA and protein expression were higher, whereas Aogen, ACE mRNA and AT2 receptor mRNA and protein expression were lower than in WKY rats. Candesartan treatment increased Aogen, ACE and AT2 receptor in SHR, and increased ACE and decreased Aogen in WKY rats, without affecting the (pro)renin and AT1 receptors.", 
    "74": "Increased (pro)renin and AT1 receptor expression in SHR substantiates the importance of the local RAS overdrive in the cerebrovascular pathophysiology in hypertension. AT1 receptor blockade and increased AT2 receptor stimulation after administration of candesartan may contribute to the protection against brain ischemia and inflammation.", 
    "75": "The development of structural changes in the systemic vasculature is the end result of established hypertension. In essential hypertension, small artery smooth muscle cells are restructured around a smaller lumen, and there is no net growth of the vascular wall, whereas in some secondary forms of hypertension and in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a hypertrophic remodeling may be detected. Indices of small resistance artery structure, such as the tunica media to internal lumen ratio, may have a strong prognostic significance in hypertensive patients. Various antihypertensive drugs seem to have different effects on vascular structure. A complete normalization of small resistance artery structure was demonstrated in hypertensive patients, after prolonged and effective therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II-receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists. Few data are available in diabetic hypertensive patients; however, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system seems to be effective in this regard.",

While collagen-induced platelet aggregation was significantly reduced by ramipril (35%; P <0.01) and captopril (27%; P = 0.01), no change was seen with enalapril. After induction with ADP, platelet aggregation was reduced in the presence of captopril therapy by 46% (P <0.05). There was a trend of inhibition with ramipril (32%, P = n.s.), whereas no antithrombotic effect was seen with enalapril.",

    "81": "The life expectancy of patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy is reduced; the main cause of death is cardiovascular disease. The majority of patients with renal replacement therapy are type 2 diabetics. Inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system is beneficial in diabetes mellitus. It reduces the incidence and slows the progression of nephropathy. ACE inhibitors are the accepted standard of care for nephropathy in type-1 diabetics; the role of ACE inhibitors versus angiotensin-receptor-blockers in type 2 diabetes is less clear. Large studies from the last 15 years and meta-analyses show a reduction of mortality of about 20% with ACE inhibitors in type 2 diabetic nephropathy; angiotensin-receptor-blockers have no documented effect on mortality yet, but do also slow the progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetics. From these data and because of economic considerations, ACE inhibitors should be first choice therapy for diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "82": "Patients with type 2 diabetes often also exhibit additional features of the metabolic syndrome. These include specifically central obesity triggering development and maintenance of diabetes together with arterial hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Chronic therapy of the metabolic syndrome in diabetics after coronary bypass surgery focuses on changes in lifestyle, i.e., cessation of smoking, changes in nutrition and increase in physical activity. Nutrition aims at fat reduction and modification to reduce saturated fatty acids, to allow mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids instead, and moderate alcohol consumption. High fiber and complex carbohydrate diet complete the recommendations. Nutrition therapy connected to increases in physical activity are aimed at reducing weight in overweight and obese subjects, which should reduce their body weight by 5 to 10% within about 6 months. Normal weight subjects benefit from increases in physical activity by lipid and glucose regulation as well as by reduction in mortality.Diabetes-specific therapy aims at normoglycemia including postprandial blood glucose levels, reduces blood pressure supported by ACE inhibitors and aims at weight reduction. Reduction of LDL-cholesterol is the first line therapy, also diminishing small-dense LDL particles. Decreasing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol are further lipid-regulating aims. Specifically diabetics after coronary bypass surgery need LDL-cholesterol levels below 70 mg/d (1.8 mmol/L) and triglycerides below 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L). In addition, in males HDL-cholesterol should be at least above 40 mg/dl (1 mmol/L), in females above 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L).", 
    "83": "Results from the HOPE and EUROPA trials showed that ACE inhibitors lower cardiovascular mortality of patients with atherosclerosis and preserved left ventricular function. However, despite apparently adequate study design, the recently conducted PEACE trial detected no benefit of an additional ACE inhibitor treatment in patients with coronary artery disease and no heart failure with respect to cardiovascular risk reduction. One of the main reasons for this discrepancy might be the lower cardiovascular baseline risk of the PEACE study population, which was more intensively treated with lipid lowering drugs and myocardial revascularization prior to enrollment than patients in HOPE or EUROPA. Another reason for the negative results of PEACE might be substance-specific differences between individual ACE inhibitors (trandolapril in PEACE, ramipril in HOPE, and perindopril in EUROPA) in their clinical efficacy to reduce cardiovascular end-points. The PEACE trial did not achieve the originally projected sample size and the addition of a soft end-point of revascularization has not been helpful. While the results from the PEACE trial suggest that low-risk patients with coronary artery disease and with preserved left ventricular function who receive intensive standard therapy including lipid lowering and coronary revascularization may not benefit from additional ACE inhibition therapy, this conclusion should be made with caution. A number of reasons, other than drug treatment efficacy, may explain the neutral results in the PEACE trial. Further studies are needed to try to resolve this issue. In the meantime, the overwhelming data still support the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease with preserved left ventricular function.", 
    "84": "Progression of renal disease and cardiovascular complications in type II diabetes mellitus have been shown to correlate with control of blood glucose, lipids, blood pressure, and smoking. These factors, however, do not appear to totally explain these diabetic complications. Renal disease and cardiovascular complications in type II diabetes are associated with vascular abnormalities and fibrosis, both of which may occur with impaired fibrinolysis. A cross-sectional study was therefore performed in 107 type II diabetic patients recruited from the Denver Metropolitan Area to examine the effect of impaired fibrinolysis, as assessed by the ratio of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) to tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). With urinary albumin excretion (UAE) as a risk factor for both renal disease progression and cardiovascular complications, the patients were analyzed with respect to UAE less than and greater than 1 gm/day. The age, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, duration of diabetes, lipids, body mass index, and smoking were no different between the groups. As expected, the group with greater UAE had worse renal function, the serum creatinine (1.98 +/- 0.24 vs 1.21 +/- 0.05 mg/dl, P < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (55.5 +/- 6.0 vs 76.8 +/- 2.7 ml/min, P < 0.001) were significantly different. The type II diabetic patients with greater UAE exhibited significantly higher PAI-1/t-PA (2.43 +/- 0.26 vs 1.85 +/- 0.07, P < 0.03). The past history of cardiac complications was also higher (87.5 vs 72.3%, P < 0.07) in the diabetic patients with more impaired fibrinolysis and greater UAE. Thus a prospective, randomized clinical trial in type II diabetes with PAI-1 inhibitors is needed.", 
    "85": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (AngII), two potent vasoactive peptides involved in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis, also induce mitogenic and pro-angiogenic responses in vitro and in vivo. Both peptides are produced by cleavage of inactive precursors by metalloproteases (endothelin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme, respectively) and activate two subtypes of membrane receptors (ETA-R and ETB-R for ET-1, AT1R and AT2R for AngII) that all belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. There is increasing evidence that ETA-R, ETB-R and AT1R are expressed in a variety of cancer cells and tissues, and may play a role on tumor growth, angiogenesis and invasion in vivo. This review summarizes the similarities and differences between the ET-1 and AngII systems with regard to their reported effects on various aspects of cancer. In addition to being expressed on vascular endothelium, ET-1 and AngII receptors participate in tumor angiogenesis through the production of the angiogenic factor VEGF. Furthermore, recent clinical studies indicate that a selective ETA-R antagonist has beneficial effects in prostate cancer, suggesting that a similar approach using ETB-R and AT1R blockers might be envisioned. Experimental data presented here suggest that a combined therapy targeting both ET-1 and AngII systems may prove valuable for future treatments of highly angiogenic tumors.",

    "91": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have cardioprotective effects in different species including human. This cardioprotective effect is mainly due to the inhibition of bradykinin (BK) degradation rather than inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Bradykinin, a nonapeptide, has been considered to be the potential target for various enzymes including ACE, neutral endopeptidase 24.11, carboxypeptidase M, carboxypeptidase N, proline aminopeptidase, endopeptidase 24.15, and meprin. In the present study, the coronary vascular beds of Sprague Dawley rat isolated hearts were perfused (single passage) with Krebs solution alone or with different concentrations of BK i.e. 2.75x10(-10), 10(-7), 10(-6) and 10(-5) M solution. Percent degradation of BK was determined by radioimmunoassay. The degradation products of BK after passing through the isolated rat-hearts were determined using RP-HPLC and mass spectroscopy. All the four doses of BK significantly decreased the perfusion pressure during their passage through the hearts. The percentage degradation of all four doses was decreased as the concentration of drug was increased, implying saturation of a fixed number of active sites involved in BK degradation. Bradykinin during a single passage through the hearts degraded to give [1-7]-BK as the major metabolite, and [1-8]-BK as a minor metabolite, detected on HPLC. Mass spectroscopy not only confirmed the presence of these two metabolites but also detected traces of [1-5]-BK and arginine. These findings showed that primarily ACE is the major cardiac enzyme involved in the degradation of bradykinin during a single passage through the coronary vascular of bed the healthy rat heart, while carboxypeptidase M may have a minor role.", 
    "92": "Patients at high risk for coronary heart disease usually have a number of atherosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries. Some plaques grow inward and, once they have caused a critical degree of luminal stenosis, lead to chronic anginal symptoms. Other plaques grow outward and remain silent unless they disrupt and trigger an acute coronary event. Either type of plaque may become vulnerable to rupture or erosion once they have reached an advanced stage. Typically, a highly stenotic fibrotic plaque is prone to erosion, whereas an advanced lipid-rich thin-cap fibroatheroma is prone to rupture. Because of the multitude and complex nature of the coronary lesions and our inability to detect silent rupture-prone plaques, the best practical approach to prevent acute coronary events is to treat the vulnerable patient, i.e., to eliminate the risk factors of coronary disease. Despite such preventive measures, a sizable number of patients still experience acute coronary events due to plaque erosion or rupture. Thus, there is room for new avenues to pharmacologically stabilize vulnerable plaques. The development of new noninvasive tools to detect the progression and regression of individual non-stenotic rupture-prone plaques will allow testing of such novel pharmacotherapies. Because no specific plaque-targeted therapies are available at present, we give an overview of the current pharmacotherapy to treat the vulnerable patient and also discuss potential novel therapies to prevent acute coronary events.", 
    "93": "The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases a spectrum of vasoactive substances and therefore plays a fundamental role in the basal and dynamic regulation of the circulation. Nitric oxide (NO)--originally described as endothelium-derived relaxing factor--is released from endothelial cells in response to shear stress produced by blood flow, and in response to activation of a variety of receptors. After diffusion from endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cells, NO increases intracellular cyclic guanosine-monophosphat concentrations by activation of the enzyme guanylate cyclase leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cells. NO has also antithrombogenic, antiproliferative, leukocyte-adhesion inhibiting effects, and influences myocardial contractility. Endothelium-derived NO-mediated vascular relaxation is impaired in spontaneously hypertensive animals. NO decomposition by free oxygen radicals is a major mechanism of impaired NO bioavailability. The resulting imbalance of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting substances disturbs the nor- mal function of the vascular endothelium. Endothelin acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived NO. In man, besides its effect of increasing arterial blood pressure, ET-1 induces vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current therapeutic strategies concentrate mainly on lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an impressive reduction in the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been achieved. Inflammatory mechanisms play an important role in vascular disease and inflammatory plasma markers correlate with prognosis. Novel therapeutic strategies specifically targeting inflammation thus bear great potential for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease.", 
    "94": "The biological actions of angiotensin II (ANG), the most prominent hormone of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), may promote the development of atherosclerosis in many ways. ANG aggravates hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and endothelial dysfunction, and thereby constitutes a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The formation of atherosclerotic lesions involves local uptake, synthesis and oxidation of lipids, inflammation, as well as cellular migration and proliferation--mechanisms that may all be enhanced by ANG via its AT1 receptor. ANG may also increase the risk of acute thrombosis by destabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and enhancing the activity of thrombocytes and coagulation. After myocardial infarction, ANG promotes myocardial remodeling and fibrosis, and its many pathological mechanisms deteriorate the prognosis of these high-risk patients in particular. Therapeutically, inhibitors of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACEI) and AT1 receptor blockers (ARB) are available to suppress the generation and cellular signaling of ANG, respectively. Despite major differences in the efficacy of ANG suppression and the modulation of other hormones and receptors, both classes of drugs are generally effective in attenuating numerous pathomechanisms of ANG in vitro, and in diminishing the development of atherosclerotic lesions and restenosis after angioplasty in various animal models. In clinical therapy, ACEI and ACE are well-tolerated antihypertensive drugs that also improve the prognosis of heart failure patients. After myocardial infarction and in stable coronary heart disease, ACEI have been shown to reduce mortality in a manner independent of hemodynamic alterations. However, there is little evidence that inhibitors of the RAAS may be effective against arterial restenosis, and a possible benefit of these substances compared to other antihypertensive drugs in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in hypertensive patients is still a matter of debate, possibly depending on the specific substance and condition being investigated. As such, the general clinical efficacy of ACEI and ARB may be due to a positive influence on hemodynamic load, vascular function, myocardial remodeling, and neuro-humoral regulation, rather than to a direct attenuation of the atherosclerotic process. Further therapeutic advances may be achieved by identifying optimum drugs, patient populations, and treatment protocols.", 
    "95": "Both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are known to be pivotal cytokines in liver fibrosis development. The aim of our current study was to elucidate the effects of dual inhibition of PDGF and TGF-beta by combination of the clinically used imatinib mesylate (STI-571) and perindopril (an ACE-inhibitor; ACE-I), respectively, on ongoing liver fibrosis development in rats. The effects of STI-571 and ACE-I at clinically comparable low doses were examined in a rat model of CCl4-induced liver fibrogenesis. Treatment with both STI-571 and ACE-I inhibited liver fibrogenesis and suppressed activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Administration of both agents exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than administration of either single agent. Our in vitro study demonstrated that STI-571 and ACE-I suppressed PDGF receptor (PDGFR) phosphorylation and TGF-beta expression in activated HSCs, respectively. Dual suppression of PDGF and TGF-beta with a combination of clinically comparable low doses of STI-571 and ACE-I exerted a significant inhibitory effect on ongoing liver fibrosis development. Since both agents are widely used in clinical practice, this combination therapy may provide a new strategy against liver fibrosis in the future.",

Little is known, however, about the significance of anemia in heart failure patients with severely depressed socioeconomic backgrounds who receive comprehensive care in a heart failure management program. The impact of anemia on mortality was investigated in 410 indigent chronic heart failure patients, the majority of whom were in New York Heart Association functional class I-III and were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta blockers at maximally tolerated doses. Anemia was present in 28% of patients. In an adjusted Cox analysis, anemia was strongly associated with mortality, but only in men: hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-4.93; p = 0.006. The investigators conclude that anemia in this population is common and that, for men, the relative risk increase associated with anemia is high.",

    "98": "The angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are very effective and safe antihypertensive drugs. They exert their antihypertensive effect through blockage of the angiotensin II, type 1 receptor and quite possibly through stimulation by angiotensin II of the unoccupied type 2 receptor. Besides hypertension, the ARBs have been found recently to be of value in the treatment of heart failure and diabetic nephropathy. In addition, ARBs have emerged lately as being very effective and perhaps superior to other antihypertensive drugs in the prevention of de novo or recurrent strokes. Other actions that may account for their stroke-protective effects include their antiatherogenic, antidiabetic, antiplatelet aggregating, hypouricemic, and atrial antifibrillatory actions. All these actions make the ARBs a true pleiotropic class of drugs. Each of the foregoing effects will be discussed briefly in this concise review.",

We used data from the PHARMO database, a record linkage system containing drug-dispensing records from community pharmacies and linked hospital discharge records of approximately 950,000 subjects. Cases discontinued their use of antihypertensive monotherapy and were not switched to other antihypertensive treatment, controls stayed on their initially prescribed monotherapy. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).", 
    "101": "In a cohort of 39,714 new users of antihypertensive drugs, we identified 9111 cases and 9111 matched controls. The percentage of non-compliant patients (compliance < 80%) among cases and controls was 14.0% and 5.8%, respectively [OR 2.86 (95%CI: 2.52-3.24)]. Patients who used less than 90 days had a higher risk on discontinuation [OR 3.10 (95%CI: 2.67-3.59)] than patients who used more than 90 days [OR 2.28 (95%CI: 1.79-2.92)]. The association was generally similar among males and females, among the different types of antihypertensives and among the different age groups.",

    "103": "A novel assay was developed for evaluation of mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and recombinant human ACE2 (rACE2) activity. Using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MS) with ProteinChip Array technology, ACE1 and ACE2 activity could be measured using natural peptide substrates. Plasma from C57BL/6 mice, kidney from wild-type and ACE2 knockout mice, and rACE2 were used for assay validation. Plasma or tissue extracts were incubated with angiotensin I (Ang I; 1296 m/z) or angiotensin II (Ang II; 1045 m/z). Reaction mixtures were spotted onto the ProteinChips WCX2 and peptides detected using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight MS. MS peaks for the substrates, Ang I and Ang II, and the generated peptides, Ang (1-7) and Ang (1-9), were monitored. The ACE2 inhibitor MLN 4760 (0.01 to 100 micromol/L) significantly inhibited rACE2 activity (IC50=3 nmol/L). Ang II was preferably cleaved by rACE2 (km=5 mumol/L), whereas Ang I was not a good substrate for rACE2. There was no detectable ACE2 activity in plasma. Assay specificity was validated in a model of ACE2 gene deletion. In kidney extract from ACE2-deficient mice, there was no generation of Ang (1-7) from Ang II. However, Ang (1-7) was produced when Ang I was used as a substrate. In conclusion, we developed a specific and sensitive assay for ACE2 activity, which used the natural endogenous peptide substrate Ang II. This approach allows for the rapid screening for ACE2, which has applications in drug testing, high-throughput enzymatic assays, and identification of novel substrates/inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "104": "Epidemiological data strongly indicate that diabetes increases the incidence of heart failure. Although the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) treatment during and after myocardial infarction has been found to be greater in diabetics than nondiabetics and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated, the molecular basis of these actions remains unclear.",

Recovery of cardiac function after ischemia/reperfusion in WT-p90RSK-Tg isolated mouse hearts was significantly impaired. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed specific induction of prorenin-converting enzyme (PRECE) in WT-p90RSK-Tg mice. mRNA induction of PRECE was confirmed with serial angiotensinogen protein reduction after perfusion in WT-p90RSK-Tg mice, suggesting an increase of angiotensinogen cleavage and subsequent RAS activation in WT-p90RSK-Tg mice. We investigated the role of the RAS in WT-p90RSK-Tg animals after ischemia/reperfusion with the use of an ACE-I (captopril) and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (olmesartan). We did not observe any effect of these inhibitors in non-Tg littermate controls, thus corroborating other reports in rodents. In contrast, both captopril and olmesartan significantly improved cardiac function and reduced infarct size in WT-p90RSK-Tg mice. At 8 months of age, WT-p90RSK-Tg mice developed cardiac dysfunction. p90RSK activity and PRECE mRNA were both increased by streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia in non-Tg littermate controls, whereas DN-p90RSK-Tg animals exposed to streptozotocin did not have PRECE induction.",

Younger patients (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.04-1.06) were also more likely to be prescribed lipid-lowering medication. Cholesterol was predicted by gender only, with females having significantly higher cholesterol (B = -0.41; 95% CI = -0.54 to -0.27). The number of missed opportunities for secondary cardiac care was greater among patients with angina only (B = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.19-0.60).

    "111": "Radioiodine is considered the treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism, but in some situations, methimazole therapy is preferred, such as in cats with pre-existing renal insufficiency. Methimazole blocks thyroid hormone synthesis, and controls hyperthyroidism in more than 90% of cats that tolerate the drug. Unfavorable outcomes are usually due to side effects such as gastrointestinal (GI) upset, facial excoriation, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or liver enzyme elevations; warfarin-like coagulopathy or myasthenia gravis have been reported but are rare. Because restoration of euthyroidism can lead to a drop in glomerular filtration rate, all cats treated with methimazole should be monitored with BUN and creatinine, in addition to serum T4, complete blood count, and liver enzymes. Transdermal methimazole is associated with fewer GI side effects, and can be used in cats with simple vomiting or inappetance from oral methimazole. Hypertension may not resolve immediately when serum T4 is normalized, and moderate to severe hypertension should be treated concurrently with-atenolol, amlodipine, or an ACE inhibitor. Alternatives to methimazole include carbimazole, propylthiouracil, or iodinated contrast agents.",

Out of a population of 92 patients with Bartter syndrome, five suffered from mild to severe hypoacusia and were selected for mutational screening. A homozygous mutation in the BSND gene was found in two female patients. The first patient was found to have a substitution in intron 1 donor splice site at position +5 (c.420+5G>C), whereas the second patient has a homozygous 3G>A substitution leading to the loss of the start codon for the translation of the BSND mRNA. The clinical courses of these two patients were remarkable for severe polyhydramnios, massive renal salt and water wasting, severe neonatal hypotonia, poor growth and unresponsiveness to prostaglandin inhibitors. The diuretic responses to furosemide and to hydrochlorothiazide were tested under KCl supplementation in one patient. A lack of response to both drugs suggested that inhibition of NaCl reabsorption in type IV Bartter syndrome is not restricted to the thick ascending limb of Henle. In one patient, a combined therapy with indomethacin and captopril was needed to discontinue intravenous fluids and improve weight gain.", 
    "113": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance. Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infections. In the lung, ACE2 protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of ARDS. Thus, the RAS appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Indeed, increasing ACE2 activity might be a novel approach for the treatment of acute lung failure in several diseases.", 
    "114": "There is increasing evidence that proteolytic cleavage gives rise to 'hidden' peptides with bioactivities that are often unpredicted and totally distinct to the parent protein. So far, the liberation of these cryptic peptides, or crypteins, has been shown to be prevalent in proteins associated with endocrine signalling, the extracellular matrix, the complement cascade and milk. A broad spectrum of proteases has been implicated in the generation of natural crypteins that appear to play a role in modulating diverse biological processes, such as angiogenesis, immune function and cell growth. The proteolytic liberation of crypteins with novel activities represents an important mechanism for increasing diversity of protein function and potentially offers new opportunities for protein-based therapeutics.",

Thiazolidinediones (TZD) could reduce urinary protein excretion in patients with microalbuminuric DN. There is little data of patients with macroalbuminuric DN. Also, there are no available clinical data regarding the effect of TZD on TGF-beta and type IV collagen in clinical DN. The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone (PGZ), a member of TZD, on urinary protein, urinary TGF-beta, and urinary type IV collagen excretion in type 2 diabetic patients with macroalbuminuric DN.",

Urinary TGF-beta excretion in the PGZ group was decreased by 47.8% which significantly differed from the 59.7% increase in the control group (p < 0.05).

    "120": "A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on the basis of a recently conducted randomized smoking cessation intervention trial in patients admitted for coronary heart disease. The cost per life year gained by the smoking cessation program was derived from the resources necessary to implement the program, the number needed to treat to get one additional quitter from the program, and the years of life gained if quitting smoking. The cost effectiveness was estimated in a low-risk group (i.e. patients with stable coronary heart disease) and a high-risk group (i.e. patients after myocardial infarction or unstable angina), using survival data from previously published investigations, and with life-time extrapolation of the survival curves by survival function modeling.", 
    "121": "In a lifetime perspective, the incremental cost per year of life gained by the smoking cessation program was euro 280 and euro 110 in the low and high-risk group, respectively (2000 prices). These costs compare favorably to other treatment modalities in patients with coronary heart disease, being approximately 1/25 the cost of both statins in the low-risk group and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the high-risk group. In a sensitivity analysis, the costs remained low in a wide range of assumptions.",

    "123": "Angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors are expressed within organs of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and seem to be important for its stress responsiveness. Secretion of CRH, ACTH, and corticosterone (CORT) is increased by stimulation of AT(1) receptors. In the present study, we tested whether a blockade of the angiotensin II system attenuates the HPA axis reactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with candesartan (2 mg/kg), ramipril (1 mg/kg), or mibefradil (12 mg/kg) for 5 wk. In addition to baseline levels, CORT and ACTH responses to injection of CRH (100 microg/kg) were monitored over 4 h. mRNA of CRH, proopiomelanocortin, AT(1A), AT(1B), and AT(2) receptors was quantified by real-time PCR. All treatments induced equivalent reductions of blood pressure and had no effect on baseline levels of CORT and ACTH. However, both candesartan and ramipril significantly reduced CRH-stimulated plasma levels of ACTH (-26 and -15%) and CORT (-36 and -18%) and lowered hypothalamic CRH mRNA (-25 and -29%). Mibefradil did not affect any of these parameters. Gene expression of AT(1A), AT(1B), and AT(2) receptors within the HPA axis was not altered by any drug. We show for the first time that antihypertensive treatment by inhibition of AT(1) receptors or angiotensin-converting enzyme attenuates HPA axis reactivity independently of blood pressure reduction. This action is solely evident after CRH stimulation but not under baseline conditions. Both a reduced pituitary sensitivity to CRH and a down-regulation of hypothalamic CRH expression have the potential to reduce HPA axis activity during chronic AT(1) blockade or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "124": "The role of ACE inhibitors (Lisinopril) in reproductive function remains controversial. Some benefits seem to be derivable even in non-hypertensive males with low doses. This study was done using rat model to establish this fact. Male rats were divided into different groups to receive different doses of lisinopril. A control group received no drugs. The mean arterial pressure fell the most with 5 mg of lisinopril. The greatest increase in sperm count and motility was recorded for this same group. This response was dose dependent, falling as the drug dose fell. Lisinopril appeared to, in a dose dependent manner, improve sperm count and motility. In low doses, there is no significant change in arterial pressure. Infertile males with poor quality semen could benefit from a low dose of ACE inhibition. Where they are also hypertensive, ACE inhibition would be an appropriate first line treatment.",

While a mean arterial pressure in the critically ill up to a value of 135 mmHg may be tolerated for some hours, in patients with dissecting aortic aneurysm, cardiac failure, angina, acute myocardial infarction, pre-eclampsia and following cardiac, vascular or cerebral surgery a mean arterial blood pressure of > 90 mmHg or greater should be lowered by up to 30% urgently. A hypertensive crisis may be defined as a MAP > 160 mmHg and can be caused by phaeochromocytoma, sympathomimetic overdose, malignant hypertension or autonomic hyper-reactivity secondary to tetanus. Treatment requires direct intra-arterial monitoring and an initial reduction in mean arterial pressure by no greater than 30%. While management of the primary condition (e.g. surgical removal of a phaeochromocytoma, delivery or termination of the pregnancy) may also be necessary, infusions of sodium nitroprusside, phentolamine, hydralazine or esmolol usually require supplementation with oral agents (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and calcium-channel blockers) for long-term management.",

Opportunities exist for health care professionals to improve the management of residents with HF through appropriate drug therapy management.", 
    "134": "Heart diseases are the leading cause of death and morbidity in western countries and among them acute coronary artery diseases result to be the major contributor. During the last few decades a lot of energy has been mostly applied to the acute phase of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS), where cardiac events concentrate. In fact a timely risk stratification along with an early aggressive invasive strategy and very powerful antithrombotic treatment have profoundly improved the in-hospital prognosis of such patients. Such a strong emphasis on the acute phase of ACS could have limited the interest in the equally important post-discharge therapies. However, several studies have demonstrated that different preventive treatments (aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and clopidogrel) could substantially reduce the long-term mortality and morbidity of such patients. Therefore, current guidelines emphasize the role of aggressive secondary preventive treatments after ACS. However, a strong discrepancy between the indications of the guidelines and their application in the real world arises day by day. Such a discrepancy could be due to errors of omission or therapeutic paradoxes. Since patients with ACS are a subgroup of subjects where secondary preventive measures could be useful and cost-effective, cardiologists should not limit their attention to the acute phase of the disease but should eagerly concentrate their efforts on an aggressive secondary preventive treatment as well. Pursuing such a task could extend and magnify the benefits obtained with acute treatment of ACS and significantly improve the outcomes of such patients. Therefore, the role of the Scientific Societies is to improve the application of guidelines and the utilization of all evidence-based treatments even in such post-discharge phase.", 
    "135": "Type 2 diabetes is becoming the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Prevalence of ESRD and the antihypertensive response to renin-angiotensin system intervention are suggested to vary among different ethnicities. The Reduction in Endpoints in Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study, which included different ethnic groups, demonstrated a renoprotective effect of losartan. A post hoc analysis from RENAAL was performed where we examined in each ethnic group the ESRD risk, identified independent predictors for ESRD, effect of degree of baseline albuminuria, effect of 6-month antiproteinuric response to therapy on ESRD, and renoprotective effect of losartan assessed by albuminuria reduction and ESRD. Baseline albuminuria was the strongest predictor for ESRD in every ethnic group. Albuminuria reduction was associated with reduced risk of ESRD while losartan reduced albuminuria in every ethnic group. When accounting for independent predictors of ESRD, losartan exhibited renoprotection in all ethnic groups. In this type 2 diabetic population with nephropathy, baseline albuminuria is the predominant risk parameter for ESRD; early antiproteinuric effect of losartan predicts long-term renoprotection; and losartan appears to be renoprotective in all ethnic groups. Since the RENAAL study was not powered to determine ethnic responses, these results underline the need for prospective trials where the aim is renal protection among different ethnic groups.",

    "146": "Several case reports have described severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients taking ACE inhibitors subsequent to being stung or receiving VIT. Exacerbation of the allergic response by ACE inhibitors is thought to be related to accumulation of bradykinin and inhibition of the formation of angiotensin II. Similar reactions have not been described with angiotensin-receptor blockers, but are theoretically possible.", 
    "147": "ACE inhibitors may exacerbate the response to insect venom, resulting in potentially life-threatening allergic reactions to insect stings or VIT. Although this risk is difficult to quantify based only on data from case reports, it seems prudent that patients with documented allergic reactions to insect venom avoid ACE inhibitor therapy, if possible. If, after careful consideration of the risks and benefits, ACE inhibitor therapy is deemed warranted, education regarding measures to minimize exposure to insect stings and training on self-administration of epinephrine should be provided, as with any person with venom allergy. In patients in whom VIT is appropriate, temporary discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor prior to each venom injection may prevent subsequent adverse reactions.",

Blood pressure was reduced in both diabetic groups (n = 12 each) similarly 4 weeks after treatment. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in venous blood data before or after treatment. However, CFVR increased significantly in the temocapril group (2.74 +/- 0.28 to 3.31 +/- 0.36, P < .0001), but not in the candesartan group (2.65 +/- 0.30 to 2.71 +/- 0.43, P = ns).",

    "157": "Large clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are associated with beneficial outcomes in patients with arterial hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, or a combination of these conditions. Other reports have suggested that ACE inhibitors prevent the development or recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia. In the TRACE trial, in patients with reduced left ventricular function after myocardial infarction, trandolapril reduced the frequency of AF. In the SOLVD trial, a 78% reduction in the frequency of AF after infarction was noted with enalapril compared with placebo. Studies in patients with persistent AF undergoing cardioversion suggest that ACE inhibitors improve outcomes and prevent AF recurrences. The mechanism of AF prevention by ACE inhibitors is unclear, but experimental data show prevention or attenuation of pacing-induced atrial remodeling with ACE inhibitor use. ACE inhibitors decrease angiotensin II concentration; angiotension II stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases, which in turn activate fibrosis formation and lead to conduction heterogeneity and induction of AF. On the other hand, AF induces atrial dilatation, atrial stretch and atrial secretion of ACE. Among other properties, ACE inhibitors have a sympatholytic effect and increase baroreceptor sensitivity. This review discusses the current data on the use of ACE inhibitors for AF prevention. Although these drugs represent a promising therapeutic option for AF patients, the data so far seem only supportive rather than definitive. Prospective trials are required to validate the benefit of ACE inhibitors and to investigate which patients are most likely to benefit from this pharmacological therapy.",

A low ABR model was obtained by the performance of sinoaortic denervation (SAD). The doses of the four drugs were as follows: nifedipine (1.5, 3.0 mg/kg), captopril (50, 100 mg/kg), atenolol (10, 20 mg/kg), and hydrochlorothiazide (20, 40 mg/kg). They were administered via an intra-gastric catheter. Compared with sham-operated rats, SAD significantly increased blood pressure variability about 2 times without modification of blood pressure level. The decrease in blood pressure level induced by the four tested drugs was larger in SAD rats than in sham-operated rats, which decreased to about 10 mmHg. Pulse interval was not changed by the treatment of captopril, but prolonged by atenolol in both sham-operated and SAD rats. In sham-operated groups, treatment of both nifedipine and hydrochlorothiazide decreased pulse interval. Whereas in sinoaortic denervated ones, this tachycardia was prevented. Among the four tested drugs, it was found that only nifedipine and atenolol significantly decreased blood pressure variability in SAD rats. It can be concluded that arterial baroreflex function was able to attenuate the hypotensive effects produced by antihypertensive drugs in conscious rats.",

In this review, the role of hypertension and proteinuria in renal disease progression, the BP target that should be achieved to slow the progression of renal damage, and the influence of baseline and current proteinuria on the renoprotective effects of antihypertensive therapy are discussed thoroughly. The interaction between the renoprotective effects of specific antihypertensive agents--mostly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers--and the level of achieved BP also are evaluated. The body of evidence provided by several studies emphasizes the importance of both lowering BP and inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system as specific goals for renal and cardiovascular protection in chronic kidney disease.", 
    "171": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in Western countries and carries an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. Studies have identified a number of factors that play a part in the development of DN. Among them, hypertension and proteinuria are the most important. In the early stages of DN, when albumin is present in the urine in very low quantities (microalbuminuria) and an increase is seen in BP, there is no loss of filtrate and patients respond well to prophylactic measures. Microalbuminuria is considered an early marker of DN. Prevention of the onset of microalbuminuria, therefore, could be considered as the primary means of preventing DN. The Bergamo Nephrologic Diabetes Complication Trial (BENEDICT) was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study that was organized in two phases. Phase A included 1204 patients and was aimed at assessing the efficacy of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril, the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker verapamil, and the trandolapril plus verapamil combination as compared with placebo in prevention of microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and normal urinary albumin excretion rate. Phase B was aimed at assessing the efficacy of the combination as compared with trandolapril alone in prevention of macroalbuminuria in patients with microalbuminuria. The BENEDICT Phase A study showed that DN can be prevented by ACE inhibitor therapy. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibition is not enhanced by combined non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker therapy. The apparent advantage of ACE inhibitors over other agents includes a protective effect on the kidney against the development of microalbuminuria, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events and death in this population.", 
    "172": "In recent years, medical practice has been influenced substantially by several factors, including the overwhelming development of evidence-based medicine, which is a consequence of the impressive, growing number of large clinical trials, the so-called \"mega-trials.\" These clinical studies are designed mostly to investigate the effects of drugs or treatments on hard end points that cannot be tested by individual physicians in their daily clinical practice. The growing role of this epidemiologic approach to medicine, which is based mostly on the assessment of the average response or behavior of large populations rather than of individuals, is systematically replacing the former knowledge and reference points of the physician, as a substitute rather than as an aid. Taking into account the case of hypertension and particularly the renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents, this article reviews the issues and limitations of transferring evidence from mega-trials to clinical practice and suggests new strategies to make trials more effective and transferable to the case of individual patients.", 
    "173": "This study evaluated the comparative effects of antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes and normoalbuminuria and the evidence supporting equivalent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes and micro- or macroalbuminuria. A systematic review was conducted by searching for randomized controlled trials (RCT) of antihypertensive agent versus placebo or another agent in hypertensive or normotensive patients with diabetes and no nephropathy and RCT of ACEi or ARB in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, conference proceedings, and contact with investigators were used to identify available evidence. Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed quality of trials. Sixteen RCT (7603 patients) of antihypertensive agents conducted in patients with diabetes and no nephropathy and 43 (7739 patients) of ACEi or ARB in patients with diabetic nephropathy were identified. A significant reduction in the risk for developing microalbuminuria in patients who had diabetes with no nephropathy was demonstrated for ACEi only (six trials, 3840 patients; relative risk [RR] 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 0.84), and in patients with diabetic nephropathy, existing RCT have shown a survival benefit of ACEi (20 trials, 2383 patients; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; P = 0.04) but not ARB (four trials, 3329 patients; RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17). On the basis of available RCT evidence, ACEi are the only agents with proven renal benefit in patients who have diabetes with no nephropathy and the only agents with proven survival benefit in patients who have diabetes with nephropathy.", 
    "174": "Recent guidelines for the management of hypertension have recognized the relevance of renal function on cardiovascular prognosis of hypertensive patients. In fact, growing evidences have confirmed that as soon as renal function exhibits minor derangements, cardiovascular risk starts a continuous rise until the development of end-stage renal disease. Both estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and death among hypertensive patients and in general population. Consequently, hypertensive patients presenting with chronic kidney disease are considered by guidelines as high-risk patients, and strict blood pressure control should be considered as a part of an integrative therapeutic approach, including correction of anemia, treatment of dyslipidemia, cessation of tobacco use, and antiplatelet therapy. This paper briefly reviews the most recent evidences about pharmacologic therapies in high-risk patients, focusing on benefits related to improvement of cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease.", 
    "175": "Patients with type 2 diabetes are prone to hypertension and persistent protein leakage from the kidney (microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria). A progressive decline in renal function can lead to overt diabetic nephropathy and ESRD. The likelihood of cardiovascular disease also is increased. Control of hypertension is paramount to prevent these life-threatening complications. Agents that target the renin-angiotensin system--angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers--have been shown to be renoprotective. The groundbreaking Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan And enalaprIL (DETAIL) trial was designed to address the absence of comparative data on the long-term effects of an angiotensin II receptor blocker versus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on renoprotection and survival in 250 patients with hypertension and early type 2 diabetic nephropathy. The primary purpose of the 5-yr double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study was to establish whether 40 to 80 mg of telmisartan conferred similar (i.e., noninferior) renoprotection to 10 to 20 mg of enalapril as determined by the change from baseline in GFR, measured by the plasma clearance of iohexol. Secondary end points included the emergence of ESRD and all-cause mortality. Telmisartan was not inferior to enalapril in reducing the decline in GFR: Mean annual declines in GFR were 3.7 and 3.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) with telmisartan and enalapril, respectively. During the 5-yr study period, no patient developed a serum creatinine >200 micromol/L, and none required dialysis.

    "181": "We observed the direct positive chronotropic effect of angiotensin II in mouse atria and characterized its pharmacological property. C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and hearts were quickly excised. Atrial preparations including right and left atrium were isolated and suspended in the organ bath filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Angiotensin II at concentrations of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M caused concentration-dependent increase in heart rate, and the maximal response was about 13% of that by isoproterenol. The effect was blocked by the selective AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan at concentrations of 10(-6) M, but not by the selective beta-blocker, nadolol at concentration of 10(-5) M. Furthermore, angiotensin I also caused concentration-dependent increase in heart rate, and the effect was blocked by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril at concentrations of 10(-6) M. These results suggested that angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II via ACE system in mice atria, and regulate heart rate through AT1-receptor stimulation, not by beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "182": "Management of hypertension is the mainstay of prevention and treatment of diabetic renal disease; evidence suggests that tight blood pressure control slows renal disease progression in established diabetic nephropathy. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has renoprotective effects over and above those achieved by lowering systemic blood pressure. To date, however, no long-term study using hard end points has directly compared current mechanisms for RAAS inhibition, angiotensin II receptor blockade (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. This issue was addressed in the recently published Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan and Enalapril (DETAIL) study, a head-to-head comparison of telmisartan and enalapril in 250 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus and early-stage nephropathy. After 5 years' treatment, change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the primary efficacy end point, was equivalent in the 2 treatment groups, as were all secondary end points. The expected steep decline in GFR in the first year was followed by a lesser decrease in the second year and then almost complete stabilization of renal function at > or =3 years. Over 5 years, no patient went into end-stage renal disease or required dialysis. There were also no increases in albumin excretion rate, nor was there an increase in creatinine beyond 200 mumol/L. Incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was extremely low in both treatment groups, a remarkable outcome given that almost 50% of patients had evidence of cardiovascular disease at randomization. Inhibition of the RAAS should play a major part in management of patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, for which both telmisartan and enalapril provide long-term renoprotection.", 
    "183": "The importance of renal function as both a marker of and risk factor for cardiovascular disease is increasingly recognized. This link is apparent even in the earliest stages of renal dysfunction, at levels that are conventionally considered \"normal.\" These findings are of considerable importance, given the prevalence of high-normal levels of albuminuria (i.e., 10 to 20 mg/L) in the general population. There is also a close link between the progression of albuminuria and the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, such that kidney disease--far from being simply a consequence of the metabolic syndrome--may be considered a component of it. It may be hypothesized that minor derangements of renal function, such as microalbuminuria or reduced glomerular filtration rate, can lead to dysfunction of the endothelium, with the consequence of sensitizing the vasculature to the injurious effects of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk factors. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is highly activated in patients with the metabolic syndrome, and this presumably is also true for the intrarenal RAS systems. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are known to reduce the progression of renal damage. Still to be resolved, however, is the optimal dosage; several recent studies indicate that the dosage required for maximal blood pressure reduction is insufficient to provide maximal renoprotection.", 
    "184": "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. Among other complications, diabetes is associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) that is thought to be equal to the risk of CHD in subjects without diabetes with previous myocardial infarction. Studies have shown that CHD risk factors start to increase long before the onset of clinical diabetes. Furthermore, the risk factors that are present in prediabetic individuals are also components of the highly prevalent metabolic syndrome. This suggests that treatment of CHD risk factors may effectively reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have proved effective in preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. A number of post hoc studies have reported consistent reductions in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in hypertensive patients treated with either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). As a result of these positive data, ongoing prospective studies are investigating whether antihypertensive agents prevent or delay the onset of diabetes in patients at risk. Telmisartan, a selective oral ARB that is indicated for first-line therapy of essential hypertension, may provide improved tolerability compared with ACE inhibitors. Therefore, the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) program is investigating the effectiveness of telmisartan in the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes. The program comprises ONTARGET and the Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND).", 
    "185": "Abdominal obesity is a recognized risk factor for both type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The metabolic consequences of obesity, such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, are primarily attributable to visceral, rather than to subcutaneous, adipose tissue. As a result, liposuction, which mainly removes subcutaneous fat, has no significant effect on insulin sensitivity; by contrast, weight loss resulting from bariatric surgical procedures is associated with resolution of type 2 diabetes in almost 80% of patients. Even modest weight loss in overweight or obese individuals is associated with significant reductions in the risk of diabetes and increased survival. Recent studies have suggested that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) functions in the regulation of adipogenesis. Activation of this system is increased in obese individuals and angiotensin II, acting via angiotensin type 1 receptors, inhibits the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. This might be expected to result in ectopic storage of fat in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity. Evidence from animal studies suggests that angiotensin-receptor blockers can promote redistribution of excess fat from these ectopic sites to mature adipocytes, resulting in improved insulin sensitivity. Clinical trials with telmisartan are currently investigating the effects of RAS blockade on insulin sensitivity in humans.",

    "187": "A review of articles reported on acute and chronic heart failure.", 
    "188": "Heart failure has been defined as that state which occurs when the heart fails to maintain the needs of the body despite a satisfactory venous return. While it has been divided functionally into high-output failure and low-output failure, it is often used to describe patients with left ventricular low-output failure and is divided into systolic or diastolic heart failure, depending on left ventricular ejection fraction. The clinical features are due largely to venous congestion and reduction in cardiac output with symptoms of fatigue, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and peripheral oedema being common complaints. Plasma natriuretic peptide levels are elevated in patients with symptomless left ventricular failure and have been useful in diagnosing heart failure in patients admitted with acute dyspnea. Treatment of heart failure is aimed at correcting both the underlying disorder as well as the precipitating cause (e.g. ischaemia, valvular heart disease, anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, etc), as well as reducing cardiac work, enhancing myocardial contractility and treating the complications (e.g. reducing salt and water retention, and neurohumoral activation). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, beta-blockers and spironolactone have all been associated with a reduction in mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. While digoxin and diuretics are used to reduce the number of episodes of pulmonary oedema, they have not been associated with a significant reduction in mortality. Surgery (e.g. transplantation, mechanical assist devices) has a definite place in young patients with chronic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe heart failure although other therapeutic agents (e.g. growth hormone, thyroxine and antioxidants) are yet to be shown to be of benefit.",

Management of the underlying disorder (e.g. ischaemia, valvular disease, hypertension) maintenance of sinus rhythm, as well as reducing excessive neurohumoral activation (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, spironolactone) can reduce mortality and improve morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure.",

Computational approaches focus on pharmacophore-based virtual screening of large compound databases. Selectivity was ensured by initial screening for ACE inhibitors within an internal database and the Derwent World Drug Index, which could be reduced to zero false positives and 0.1% hit rate, respectively. An average hit reduction of 0.44% was achieved with a five feature hypothesis, searching approximately 3.8 million compounds from various commercial databases. Seventeen compounds were selected based on high fit values as well as diverse structure and subjected to experimental validation in a bioassay. We show that all compounds displayed an inhibitory effect on ACE2 activity, the six most promising candidates exhibiting IC50 values in the range of 62-179 microM.", 
    "191": "Information on the regional concentrations of angiotensin (Ang) II and its type-1 and -2 receptors (AT(1)R, AT(2)R) in the kidney is still incomplete. Published data on the levels of arterially delivered Ang I and II (Ang Ia, Ang IIa) and intrarenally produced Ang I and II (Ang Ii, Ang IIi) in the renal vein and in whole tissue were analyzed by using a kinetic model of Ang production and distribution in the glomerular and peritubular cortical tissue regions (Glom, Pt). (1) 90% of Ang II is cell-associated, due to its binding to AT(1)R and AT(2)R; (2) most Ang II in the renal cortex is Ang IIi; (3) Ang IIa is mainly localized in Glom; (4) Ang Ii rather than Ang Ia is a substrate of renal angiotensin-converting enzyme; (5) Ang IIi is localized in Pt and its concentration in interstitial fluid is 5-15 times the Ang II concentration in arterial plasma; and (6) in Glom the interstitial concentration of cell surface-bound AT(1)R is above 200K(d), and in Pt the AT(1)R and AT(2)R concentrations are above 10K(d). In conclusion, endocrine Ang II mainly acts in Glom, whereas Pt is exposed to paracrine Ang II generated by the conversion of intrarenally produced Ang I. High AT(1)R concentrations in Glom and Pt favor diffusion-limited binding, so that the apparent binding rate constant at sites closest to the source of Ang II delivery is greatly increased. Results may explain why the kidney is responsive to low levels of endocrine Ang II, despite its high content of paracrine Ang II.", 
    "192": "Despite current therapy with agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, renal dysfunction continues to progress in a significant proportion of patients with kidney disease. Several pre-clinical studies have reported beneficial effects of tranilast, an inhibitor of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta's actions in a range of diseases that are characterized by fibrosis. However, whether such therapy provides additional benefits in renal disease, when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, has not been explored. We randomized subtotally (5/6) nephrectomized rats to receive vehicle, the ACE inhibitor, perindopril (6 mg/l), tranilast (400 mg/kg/day), or their combination for 12 weeks. When compared with sham-nephrectomized animals, subtotally nephrectomized animals had reduced creatinine clearance, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and evidence of TGF-beta activity, as indicated by the abundant nuclear staining of phosphorylated Smad2. These manifestations of injury and TGF-beta activation were all attenuated by treatment with either tranilast or perindopril, with the latter also attenuating the animals' hypertension. When compared with single-agent treatment, the combination of tranilast and perindopril provided additional, incremental improvements in creatinine clearance, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis, and a reduction in nuclear phsopho-Smad2 beyond single-agent treatment. These findings indicate that the combination of tranilast and perindopril was superior to single-agent treatment on kidney structure and function in the remnant kidney model, and suggests the potential for such dual therapy in kidney disease that continues to progress despite blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "193": "In order to adequately control hypertension, the majority of patients will require treatment with more than one antihypertensive agent. Fixed-dose combination therapy offers several advantages, including improved efficacy, tolerability, and treatment compliance. Certain combinations have benefits in specific patient populations, such as the elderly or those with comorbidities. In this review, we evaluate the BP-lowering efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and amlodipine besylate/benazepril in similarly designed, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in similar patient populations. This indirect comparison showed that both combinations significantly improve both systolic and diastolic BP compared with monotherapy with the individual agents or placebo; it also demonstrated that the combinations were well tolerated. Both combination therapies significantly improved response rates, but olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ achieved the highest control rates compared with the individual agents. On the basis of an indirect comparison of published factorial design studies, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ appears to be at least as effective as amlodipine besylate/benazepril and may provide quantitatively greater reductions in diastolic BP at commonly used dosages. A randomized clinical trial comparing the two combinations is needed to confirm these findings.", 
    "194": "Over the last 30 years, there has been considerable progress in the management of aneurysms of the ascending aorta whether isolated or related to Marfan's syndrome which has considerably increased the life expectancy of these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the management protocol proposed in France for this condition in order to establish recommendations. A questionnaire was sent to cardiologists, paediatric cardiologists and cardiac surgeons and also to patients diagnosed with Marfan's syndrome. Most of the 228 physicians who replied prohibited violent sporting activities and less than a quarter advised against all sports. There was a wide dispersion in the prescription of beta blockers in Marfan's syndrome as 57% proposed this treatment only in cases with dilatation of the aorta and 5% prescribed no treatment at all. On the other hand, beta blockers were widely prescribed (93%) after replacement of the ascending aorta. When poorly tolerated in adults, the most commonly prescribed option was a calcium antagonist (60%) followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and therapeutic abstention. On the other hand, 60% of paediatric cardiologists preferred to withdraw treatment. These results were confirmed by the replies from patients with Marfan's syndrome: 58.3% were prescribed beta blockers with a higher proportion in children less than 12 years of age. This treatment was introduced late, about 7 years after diagnosis. The authors conclude that there is much disparity in the management of ascending aortic aneurysms whether or not associated with Marfan's syndrome, especially with regards the prescription of beta blockers, justifying the publication of recommendations.", 
    "195": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic renal failure in countries in the western world. Human polymorphism studies have suggested a nephroprotective effect that is mediated by bradykinin B2 receptors. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have an additive nephroprotective effect in patients with diabetes, which may be due to ACE-inhibitor-mediated increases in the levels of bradykinin. There is also evidence from studies conducted in genetically altered mice to suggest that bradykinin is nephroprotective. Finally, evidence from animal models of nephropathy indicates that some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and vasopeptidase inhibitors are due to the action of bradykinin at B2 receptors. These data establish that stimulation of bradykinin B2 receptors is a target in diabetic nephropathy, and should provide impetus for the development of non-peptide, selective bradykinin B2 agonists.",

Wistar rats were given 1% NaCl to drink and treated with one of the following combinations for 6 weeks: vehicle; aldosterone (0.75 microg/h); aldosterone plus a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, spironolactone (20 mg/kg/day); aldosterone plus an ACE inhibitor, imidapril (1 mg/kg/day); aldosterone plus an NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, apocynin (0.5 mmol/l); and aldosterone plus an Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (3 mg/kg/day). Upregulated expression of ACE and EGFR and p44/p42ERK phosphorylation were suppressed by spironolactone or imidapril. Upregulated NAD(P)H oxidase subunits and LOX-1 expression were inhibited by spironolactone or apocynin. Increased expression of RhoA and Rho-kinase and myosin light chain phosphorylation were decreased by spironolactone or Y-27632. Moreover, these drugs effectively inhibited the vascular lesion formation, as measured by the medial thickness and level of perivascular fibrosis, and suppressed the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1, type I and III collagen, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA. Spironolactone may be useful as a cardioprotective agent to prevent cardiovascular remodeling via the ACE/EGFR/ERK, NAD(P)H oxidase/LOX-1, and Rho-kinase pathways.",

To test this hypothesis further, we also looked at the risk for CAP in those taking angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), as these drugs have a similar mechanism of action to that of ACE inhibitors but have minimal or no effect on the cough reflex. In addition, the putative protection against pneumonia may instead be related to general inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.",

The introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has transformed the management of this condition. However, a significant proportion of patients fail to respond to even high doses of rHuEPO. Several factors have been implicated in the hyporesponsiveness to rHuEPO. Iron deficiency, whether absolute or functional, is considered the most important, and maintenance of adequate iron stores reduces rHuEPO requirements among patients on hemodialysis. However, traditional indices of iron that are currently utilized may not reflect iron stores accurately, and there is also increasing concern regarding the potential long-term toxicity of parenteral iron therapy. Infection and inflammation also influence the response to rHuEPO, both by disruption of iron metabolism and by eliciting the release of cytokines that inhibit erythropoiesis. Oxidative stress may contribute to rHuEPO hyporesponsiveness directly by promoting lipid peroxidation in cell membranes, leading to increased erythrocyte fragility and reduced life span and also through its strong association with inflammation. Severe hyperparathyroidism can lead to a reduced number of erythroid progenitor cells. Inadequate dialysis dose, aluminum overload, nutritional factors such as deficiencies of carnitine, vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin C can also reduce the efficacy of rHuEPO therapy. Hyporesponsiveness to rHuEPO presents a challenge to both diagnosis and management in an era where optimizing response to rHuEPO is critical both in limiting the burgeoning costs of anemia management and improving clinical outcomes in the dialysis population.",

Although most patients have systolic dysfunction ([ejection fraction] less than 40%), the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction (a normal to elevated ejection fraction) is rising and it accounts for at least one-third of all cases. Six drugs/drug classes are contemporary treatments in systolic heart failure, depending on NYHA functional class: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin II receptor-blockers, and digoxin. Clinicians should be aware that studies demonstrate all these drugs/drug classes prolong survival in systolic heart failure, except diuretics and digoxin. Some patients with systolic dysfunction also may be candidates for the combination of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate as well as nonpharmacological approaches with biventricular pacemakers and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillators.

    "214": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of salt-induced hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II-type 1 receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor blockers are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart disease. In addition to their blood pressure lowering effects, they appear to protect against myocardial, renal, and vascular damage. In various models of hypertension, generation of reactive oxygen species is increased in the vasculature and that treatment with antioxidants or superoxide dismutase mimetics (e.g., tempol) improves vascular function and structure and reduces blood pressure. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor; eplerenone, a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist; and tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, on salt-induced hypertension in Dahl Salt-Sensitive rats. The rats were placed on a high salt (HS; 8%) diet for 3 weeks prior to switching to a normal salt (0.3%) diet for an additional 3 weeks. While on the normal salt (NS) diet, rats were treated with enalapril (30 mg/kg/day in the drinking water), eplerenone (100 mg/kg/day by gavage), tempol (1 mM/day in the drinking water), eplerenone + enalapril, eplerenone + enalapril + tempol, or without drug treatment (control). After 3 weeks on HS diet, systolic blood pressure rose from 127 +/- 7 to 206 +/- 11 mm Hg and remained elevated when switched to NS diet. Subsequently, treatment with eplerenone alone or in combination with enalapril and tempol produced a stepwise reduction in systolic blood pressure reaching -80 mm Hg; however, enalapril and tempol alone produced more modest pressure reduction (approximately -35 mmHg). Plasma levels of prostacyclin and nitric oxide were elevated in rats treated with enalapril and eplerenone alone or in combination. Enalapril and eplerenone alone and in combination reduced heart and kidney levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone when compared with control. Renal and heart levels of reduced glutathione were diminished by eplerenone alone; however, enalapril tended to attenuate the effect of eplerenone on reduced glutathione levels in the heart. The findings from this study suggest that eplerenone reduces salt-induced hypertension by increasing endothelium-derived relaxing factors, inhibiting RAAS components and oxidative stress.

In addition, there existed no regional difference in the incidence of ESRD due to polycystic kidney disease, the major genetic disorder of the kidneys. These findings suggest that the presence of factors other than genetic disposition contribute to the differences. On the other hand, there were similar regional variations in the incidences of ESRD between two causes of ESRD: chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. Because it is unlikely that the regional distribution of underlying disease incidence and the disease-specific progression rate would be similar for two different causes, this observation suggests that factors governing the progression rate, which operate commonly for all causes of ESRD but differ among regions, may play an important role in generating the regional differences. Finally, we examined regional differences in the amounts of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system used, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in our search for an explanation of the regional differences in ESRD dynamics. Among antihypertensive agents examined, only ACE inhibitors were negatively correlated with the annual incidence of ESRD. The renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors have been established by results with animal models of progressive nephropathy and by large-scale clinical trials. Our epidemiological results for Japan as a whole show the same protective effects still more convincingly from a different approach. It is not completely clear yet at present, however, how regional variations in the incidence of ESRD are generated.

Quality control (QC) samples (5, 10, 100 and 500 ng ml(-1)) in five replicates from three different runs of analyses demonstrated intra-assay precision (coefficient of variation (CV) < or =14.6%), inter-assay precision (CV < or = 5.6%) and overall accuracy (relative error less than -8.0%). The method can be used to quantify benazepril, benazeprilat and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma, covering a variety of pharmacokinetic or bioequivalence studies.", 
    "237": "Variants of survivin with differing subcellular localizations might mediate the different functions of survivin, i.e. cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis inhibition. Highly proliferative tumors are more sensitive to chemotherapy, whereas apoptosis resistant cells would be refractory to endocrine therapy. Possibly, this explains incongruent data on the association of survivin with prognosis in breast cancer. Survivin levels were measured using ELISA in 800 x g pellets and 100,000 x g supernatants of breast cancer tissues from patients that were treated with either chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for advanced disease. These fractions might be enriched with nuclear or cytoplasmatic located survivin variants. Survivin levels were associated with tumors with poor prognostic clinical characteristics. For the patients treated with endocrine therapy, the patients with high survivin levels exhibited a significantly shorter progression free survival (PFS) than those who had low levels (pellet survivin Hazard Ratio (HR)=2.74, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=1.31-5.72, p=0.008 and median PFS 5.8 versus 8.6 months, p=0.006, log-rank; cytosolic survivin HR=3.03, 95% CI=1.45-6.35, p=0.003). In contrast, for patients treated with chemotherapy, those with high cytosolic survivin had a significantly longer PFS than those with low levels (median PFS of 6.2 months, versus 4.7 months for patients with low cytosolic concentrations, p=0.024, log-rank). Thus, high levels of survivin are mainly related with a poor response to endocrine therapy, but a good response to chemotherapy. This phenomenon might be related to the different functions of survivin.", 
    "238": "The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is strongly associated with CKD and constitutes one of its major causes of morbidity and mortality. Treatments that slow the progression of CKD and improve the cardiovascular risk profile of patients with CKD are needed. The endothelins (ET) are a family of related peptides, of which ET-1 is the most powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and the predominant isoform in the cardiovascular and renal systems. The ET system has been widely implicated in both CVD and CKD. ET-1 contributes to the pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension and arterial stiffness and more novel cardiovascular risk factors such as oxidative stress and inflammation. Through these, ET also contributes to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. By reversal of these effects, ET antagonists may reduce cardiovascular risk. In particular relation to the kidney, antagonism of the ET system may be of benefit in improving renal hemodynamics and reducing proteinuria. ET likely also is involved in progression of renal disease, and data are emerging to suggest a synergistic role for ET receptor antagonists with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in slowing CKD progression.",

The inclusion criteria were no prior use of antihypertensive agents; blood pressure < 130/85 mmHg; urinary albumin excretion < 30 mg/day; and absence of renal failure, diabetietes, and hypertensive retinopathy. A total of 30 healthy individuals (16 female) (Group 2) were assessed as the control group.

    "262": "Animal models have revealed the effectiveness of arginine vasopressin in increasing vital organ perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A multicentre trial compared arginine vasopressin and epinephrine in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and documented a significant improvement in hospital discharge rates in arginine vasopressin-treated (up to 2 x 40 IU) patients with asystole, and a significant benefit of the combined administration of arginine vasopressin and epinephrine on hospital discharge, irrespective of the underlying electrocardiographic rhythm. The stabilization of advanced shock states unresponsive to conventional therapy can be achieved by supplementary arginine vasopressin (1-4 IU/h). A randomized, controlled trial found that the combined infusion of arginine vasopressin and norepinephrine was superior to norepinephrine alone in reversing advanced vasodilatory shock. Furthermore, the successful employment of arginine vasopressin in uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock and other shock states, such as anaphylaxis, hypotension during spinal/epidural anaesthesia, postcardiotomy shock, acute brain injury, brain-dead organ donors, perioperative hypotension in patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, shock after pheochromocytoma surgery, and carcinoid crisis have been reported.", 
    "263": "Whereas arginine vasopressin in combination with epinephrine can significantly increase hospital discharge in cardiac arrest, arginine vasopressin combined with catecholamines improved haemodynamics in vasodilatory and haemorrhagic shock, but effects on outcome remain unknown. Nonetheless, in the perioperative setting, arginine vasopressin may already be considered as a potent adjunct vasopressor agent in advanced shock states unresponsive to conventional therapy.", 
    "264": "In the failing heart, the local angiotensin II concentration is increased, and the extent of cardiac angiotensin II release is related to the clinical signs of heart failure. The enzymes involved in myocardial generation of angiotensin II are the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymases. While myocardial angiotensin II is mainly generated by chymases in the human heart, ACE inhibitors nevertheless improve left ventricular (LV) function, attenuate LV remodelling and reduce mortality in heart failure patients. These beneficial actions of ACE inhibitors, however, relate to their beneficial effect on kinin metabolism. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists also mediate part of their beneficial effects through increased bradykinin formation. However, in contrast to ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists attenuate downstream signalling of angiotensin II-induced AT1 receptor activation, which increases the activity of existing proteins (e.g. NADPH oxidase) and the de novo synthesis of proteins (e.g. inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) in cardiomyocytes. Given the multiple actions of AT1 receptor activation on cardiomyocyte and non-cardiomyocyte function in the presence of an increased myocardial AngII concentration, the reduction of cardiovascular mortality and rate of hospitalization following AT1 receptor blockade in heart failure patients not receiving ACE inhibitors is not surprising. Most importantly, the beneficial effects of AT1 receptor blockade are not only achieved when used as an alternative to ACE inhibition, but also when used on top of ACE inhibitors.",

Several examinations were performed (thoracic radiographs, faecal analysis, heartworm antigen test, tracheal fluoroscopy, abdominal ultrasound, complete blood cell count, urine and serum biochemistry) but the PAH remained of unknown origin. Despite medical treatment (diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), cardiovascular and respiratory signs dramatically worsened over a 1-month period, with several daily syncope, cyanosis and tachypnoea at rest requiring permanent oxygen therapy. Oral tadalafil (Cialis), a new long-acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, belonging to the same family as sildenafil (Viagra), was added to the background therapy. The condition of the dog improved quickly (< 24 h), and short-term follow up (7 days) showed a decrease in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure up to 26 mmHg concomitant with the disappearance of all respiratory and cardiac signs of PAH (cyanosis, syncope and tachypnoea). This case is of interest because it concerns the first reported short-term use of tadalafil in canine PAH. However, long-term studies with a large number of diseased animals are now required before prescription by general practitioners could be recommended.",

Using multidimensional NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) technique, the trace-level impurity was unambiguously identified to be 2-(-2-oxo-azocan-3-ylamino)-4-phenyl-butyric acid after isolation from lisinopril bulk drug by semi-preparative HPLC. Formation of the impurity was also discussed. To our knowledge, this is a novel impurity and not reported elsewhere.", 
    "272": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) provide renoprotection. A low sodium diet enhances their efficacy. However, the added effect of sodium restriction on proteinuria and blood pressure is not invariably associated with better preservation of renal morphology, suggesting that the combination of ACEi with a low sodium diet can elicit renal structural abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, the effects of ACEi in combination with a control (CS) or a low sodium (LS) diet were investigated in healthy rats and in adriamycin nephrotic rats. After 3 weeks of treatment, rats were sacrificed and kidneys examined for renal structural abnormalities. In healthy rats, ACEi reduced blood pressure: the fall in blood pressure was significantly greater in the ACEi/LS group. Renal morphology was normal in the ACEi/CS group but severe interstitial damage was found in the ACEi/LS group. This was associated with increased interstitial macrophage influx and up-regulation of osteopontin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen III expression. In addition, ACEi/LS induced an increase in the total medial area of afferent arterioles. In nephrotic rats, ACEi/LS reduced both blood pressure and proteinuria, whereas only blood pressure was reduced in the ACEi/CS group. Mild interstitial damage was present in the ACEi/CS group but, strikingly, pronounced tubulo-interstitial abnormalities occurred in the ACEi/LS group, similar to those seen in ACEi/LS healthy rats, with similar changes in afferent arteriolar walls. In conclusion, the combination of ACEi/LS elicits pronounced renal interstitial abnormalities in healthy and nephrotic rats, despite a significant reduction of proteinuria in the latter. Considering their occurrence in healthy rats, these renal adverse effects cannot be due to specific characteristics of adriamycin nephrosis. Further studies should elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations and their impact on long-term renoprotection.",

    "274": "Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous compound, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the function of the cardiovascular system, where it induces vasorelaxing and antiplatelet responses, mainly through the stimulation of guanylate cyclase and the increase of cGMP. Many drugs of common, time-honoured clinical use (for example, glycerol trinitrate and all the vasodilator nitrites and nitrates) act via the release of exogenous NO, thus mimicking the effects of the endogenous factor. In the last few years, a revision of the \"one-compound-one-target\" paradigm has led pharmacologists and pharmaceutical chemists to develop new classes of molecules which combine different pharmacodynamic properties. This innovative pharmacological/pharmaceutical strategy has produced hybrid drugs, with a dual mechanism of action: a) the slow release of nitric oxide and b) another fundamental pharmacodynamic profile. These drugs have been obtained by inserting appropriate NO-donor chemical groups (i.e. nitrate esters, nitrosothiols, etc.), linked to a known drug, by means of a variable spacer moiety. These new pharmacodynamic hybrids present the advantage of combining a basic mechanism of action (for example, cyclooxygenase inhibition, beta-antagonism or ACE inhibition) with a slow release of NO, which may be useful either to reduce adverse side effects (for example, the gastrotoxicity of NSAIDs), or to improve the effectiveness of the drug (for example, conferring direct vasorelaxing and antiplatelet effects on an ACE-inhibitor). The aim of this review is to present the chemical features of NO-releasing hybrids of cardiovascular drugs, and to explain the pharmacological improvements obtained by the addition of the NO-donor properties.", 
    "275": "Diastolic heart failure occurs when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present but left ventricular systolic function is preserved (i.e., ejection fraction greater than 45 percent). The incidence of diastolic heart failure increases with age; therefore, 50 percent of older patients with heart failure may have isolated diastolic dysfunction. With early diagnosis and proper management the prognosis of diastolic dysfunction is more favorable than that of systolic dysfunction. Distinguishing diastolic from systolic heart failure is essential because the optimal therapy for one may aggravate the other. Although diastolic heart failure is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from systolic heart failure, normal ejection fraction and abnormal diastolic function in the presence of symptoms and signs of heart failure confirm diastolic heart failure. The pharmacologic therapies of choice for diastolic heart failure are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and beta blockers.", 
    "276": "Once contraindicated, beta-blockers have become, along with ACE inhibitors, diuretics and agiotensin II receptor blockers, an established, evidence-based, recommended treatment concept in chronic heart failure. The increased activation of the adrenergic system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure syndrome provides the rationale for the use of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure influencing upon the most important pathological changes in the condition. Long term treatment with beta blockers additive to an ACE inhibitor and diuretic results in normalization of left ventricular function and EF. The long term treatment of heart failure using beta blockers reduces morbidity and mortality from this condition.",

Including additional regimes justifiable by patients' co-morbidities, increased overall 'rational' prescribing by 11%, but differences among countries remained similar. Multivariate analysis for one-drug and two-drug regimes explained between 35% and 42% of the total variance, country contributed 7%-8% (p < 0.005). Countries determined the number of drugs used and the likelihood of individual drug regimes. For example, in Czech Republic digoxin alone was more likely to be given than the recommended ACE-inhibitors (OR: 3.45; 95%CI: 2.56-4.64), while the combination of digoxin with ACE-inhibitors was as likely as the recommended combination of ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers (OR: 1.17; 95%CI: 0.88-1.55).",

    "281": "Angiotensinogen (ANG) is the sole substrate of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Clinical studies have shown that RAS activation may lead to hypertension, a major cardiovascular and renal risk factor. To delineate the underlying mechanisms of hypertension-induced nephropathy, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress rat ANG (rANG) in the kidney to establish whether intrarenal RAS activation alone can evoke hypertension and kidney damage and whether RAS blockade can reverse these effects. Transgenic mice overexpressing renal rANG were generated by employing the kidney-specific, androgen-regulated protein promoter linked to rANG cDNA. This promoter targets rANG cDNA to renal proximal tubules and responds to androgen stimulation. Transgenic mice displayed kidney-specific expression of rANG, significantly increased blood pressure (BP) and albuminuria in comparison to non-transgenic littermates. Administration of losartan (an angiotensin II (type 1)-receptor antagonist) or perindopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) reversed these abnormalities in transgenic animals. Renal injury was evident on examination of the kidneys in transgenic mice, and attenuated by losartan and perindopril treatment. We conclude that the overproduction of ANG alone in the kidney induces an increase in systemic BP, proteinuria, and renal injury. RAS blockers prevent these abnormalities. These data support the role of the intrarenal RAS in the development of hypertension and renal injury.", 
    "282": "Hyperactivation of systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during sepsis is well documented. However, the behavior of intrarenal RAS in the context of endotoxemia is yet to be defined. The present study evaluates the direct effect of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on immortalized human mesangial cell (HMC) RAS. Quiescent HMC were incubated with vehicle or LPS (1-100 microg/ml), and levels of angiotensin I and II (Ang I and II) and their metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and renin activity were also investigated. Cell lysate and extracellular medium levels of Ang II were rapidly reduced (1 h) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, reaching a significant -9 fold-change (P<0.001) after 3 h of LPS incubation. Similar results were obtained for Ang I levels (-3 fold-change, P<0.001). We ruled out Ang I and II degradation, as levels of their metabolic fragments were also significantly decreased by LPS. ACE activity was slightly increased following LPS incubation. On the other hand, renin activity was significantly inhibited, as Ang I concentration elevation following exogenous angiotensinogen administration was blunted by LPS (-60% vs vehicle, P<0.001). Renin and angiotensinogen protein levels were not affected by LPS according to Western blot analysis. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that LPS significantly downregulates HMC RAS through inhibition of renin or renin-like activity. These findings are potentially related to the development of and/or recovery from acute renal failure in the context of sepsis.",

    "285": "We reviewed the data on pediatric dosages of antihypertensive drugs in the I-V (44th and 45th editions). When there were several drugs for the same molecule, the last one marked with the Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumption's logo was selected. When information on a particular drug was not available, the entries for other drugs with the same active principle were reviewed. The information was compared with that provided by the Fourth Report of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group (NHBPEP).", 
    "286": "A total of 111 entries for 41 antihypertensive drugs were reviewed. Information on use in children is available for only 3 diuretics and 2 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The remaining entries either contain no information or indicate that the effectiveness and safety in children has not been evaluated. Some drugs are contraindicated in children. The Fourth Report of the NHBPEP includes pediatric dosages for 28 antihypertensive drugs. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized 10 antihypertensive drugs for use in children.", 
    "287": "The information in the V-I can be used to determine the correct dosage of only 5 antihypertensive drugs in children, making this age group authentic therapeutic orphans.", 
    "288": "The available data on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the associated risks for contrast-induced nephropathy are sparse and conflicting. Nevertheless, it is a common practice to hold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors before contrast media administration. The reduction of renal blood flow that occurs following the administration of contrast media may be due to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system causing constriction of the afferent arterioles. The influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration on the development of contrast-induced nephropathy was discussed in this letter.", 
    "289": "ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION AND DYSFUNCTION: During the past two decades, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of normal endothelial function in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis and vascular health. Abnormalities in the function of endothelium have been recognized in a number of conditions. One of the most important abnormalities of endothelial dysfunction appears to be changes in the bioavailability of nitric oxide. It now appears clear that abnormalities in endothelial dysfunction are associated with abnormalities in the production of nitric oxide and/or abnormalities in the rate of its degragation. Either way, loss of the functional availability of nitric oxide appears to be an important characteristic of endothelial dysfunction. ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION AND DIABETES: Impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilatation has been described in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and the degree of impairment may correlate with glycemic control. Hyperglycemia itself appears to affect multiple mechanisms that increase atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia enhances oxidation, thrombosis, inflammation, matrix production, and the formation of advanced glycation end-products and other metabolites that can potentially damage the vasculature. TREATMENT OF ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION: A number of trials have demonstrated that therapy with lipid lowering agents (statins) as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with improvements in endothelial function in diabetes. These agents have also been shown to improve prognosis in patients with a number of underlying cardiac diseases and risk factors for cardiac disease. Therefore, it seems that interventions that lead to improvement in endothelial function can be associated with improvements in cardiovascular outcome. The role of antioxidant therapy is controversial. No data have been published regarding the effects of hormonal replacement therapy on endothelial dysfunction in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "290": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) prevent target organ damage in several models of hypertension. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the ACE-I enalapril (10 mg/kg(-1) per day, gavage) on the cardiovascular alterations and production of free radicals induced by chronic infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II, 200 ng/kg(-1) per minute, s.c.) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Enalapril was given concomitantly for the 10 days of Ang II infusion (prevention) or from day 10 to 17 of Ang II infusion (intervention). The influence of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (600 mg/L(-1) in drinking water) was evaluated. Enalapril and apocynin had no effect on hypertension in the prevention and intervention studies. Enalapril prevented the increase in heart weight index (HWI), carotid cross-sectional area (CSA) and albuminuria induced by Ang II. Enalapril reduced HWI and albuminuria whereas CSA was not affected in the intervention study. Apocynin had effects comparable to enalapril. Both enalapril and apocynin reduced the overproduction of superoxide anion by the left ventricle and rise in advanced oxidation protein products induced by Ang II. Therefore, the antioxidant but not the antihypertensive effect of enalapril may participate in the prevention and treatment of the Ang II-induced cardiovascular and renal alterations.", 
    "291": "It has been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have a differential effect on brachial and aortic haemodynamics. This is why they seem to have beneficial effects that are beyond brachial blood pressure (BP) lowering. We aimed to investigate if this was the case with losartan when compared to atenolol. We also investigated the differential effect of losartan and atenolol on the prognostic marker, brain type natriuretic peptide (BNP).", 
    "292": "We studied 17 patients who were similar to those in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study. Patients were randomised to receive four months of losartan and atenolol in a crossover fashion. Main outcome measures were BNP and Augmentation index (AIx), which gives an indication of central haemodynamics. Brachial pulse wave velocity (PWV) and time to reflected wave (Tr) were measured as an indication of vascular stiffness.", 
    "293": "BNP was significantly lower on losartan than atenolol (p=0.007). AIx was lower on losartan than atenolol (p=0.03), however, this result was not significant when heart rate was considered as a covariate (p=0.09). Heart rate was significantly lower on atenolol than losartan (p=0.03). There was no difference between treatments for both brachial PWV and Tr (p=0.2 and p=0.99, respectively).", 
    "294": "The benefits seen when losartan was compared to atenolol in the LIFE trial may be due to a reduction in BNP. We failed to detect a differential effect in central compared to peripheral haemodynamics when losartan was compared to atenolol.", 
    "295": "Animal studies demonstrated an interaction between angiotensin II (Ang II) responsiveness and endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR). However, this relation has not been well described in humans. Therefore, we investigated the relation between Ang II responsiveness and EDR in isolated human arteries.", 
    "296": "Segments of the internal mammary artery (IMA) were harvested from 89 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Rings of these segments were exposed in organ bath experiments to metacholine (ME; 10 nmol/L-0.1 mmol/L) after precontraction with phenylephrine (PE; 10 micromol/L), and secondly to increasing concentrations of Ang II (0.1 nmol/L-1 micromol/L).", 
    "297": "Patients with the highest contraction to Ang II showed the lowest ME relaxation (r=0.312; p=0.003). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition significantly increased Ang II sensitivity (p=0.03). This increase was accompanied by a tendency toward decreased EDR (p=0.07). The inverse relation between Ang responsiveness and endothelium-dependent relaxation could not be explained by an increased tissue or serum ACE-inhibition in patients with a higher endothelium-dependent relaxation.", 
    "298": "High Ang II responsiveness inversely correlates to EDR in IMA's of patients with established coronary artery disease. Short-term treatment with an ACE-inhibitor increased the response to Ang II, but had an adverse effect on EDR.", 
    "299": "Combined therapy with optimum doses of a beta-blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) is the mainstay for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). However, patients cannot be started on full doses of both drugs and treatment has to be initiated one way or the other. The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) III was the first trial investigating the optimum sequence of initiating treatment of CHF, in terms of mortality and morbidity. CIBIS III compared randomised, open-label initial monotherapy with bisoprolol or enalapril for six months, followed by their combination for six to 24 months, in 1,010 patients at least 65 years of age, with stable, mildly or moderately symptomatic, systolic CHF. The two strategies were similarly efficacious in terms of the combined primary endpoint of mortality or all-cause hospitalisation, and showed similar safety. The bisoprolol-first approach showed a 28% lower mortality at the end of the monotherapy phase (p=0.24) and a 31% lower mortality at the end of the first year (p=0.06), but a 25% increase in worsening of CHF events (p=0.23). The main conclusion is that, CHF therapy may be started with bisoprolol or enalapril in patients like those in CIBIS III. However, it may be argued that the primary therapeutic goal in the early phase of CHF should be improved survival, whereas the long-term aim, achievable during combined therapy with optimum doses of several drugs, should be improved quality of life, physical function, morbidity and survival. In such case, the CIBIS III findings would tend to support starting CHF therapy with bisoprolol rather than enalapril in stable patients with mild or moderate symptoms.", 
    "300": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a regulatory hormone widely expressed, along with its receptors, in organs and body tissues. ANP is well known to inhibit aldosterone secretion from mammalian adrenals, but its effect on glucocorticoid-hormone production is controversial. In vivo experiments showed that prolonged ANP administration raised the plasma concentration of cortisol in both normal and dexamethasone/captopril-treated guinea pigs (i.e. in animals with pharmacologically interrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system). ANP did not affect cortisol secretion from dispersed guinea pig zona fasciculata-reticularis cells, but enhanced catecholamine release from adrenomedullary cells. ANP stimulated cortisol output from guinea pig adrenal slices containing medullary chromaffin tissue, and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol blocked this effect. The conclusion is drawn that ANP, when the structural integrity of the adrenal gland is preserved, is able to enhance glucocorticoid secretion in guinea pigs, through an indirect mechanism involving the rise in the catecholamine release, which in turn, acting in a paracrine manner, stimulate secretion of inner adrenocortical cells.", 
    "301": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently results in cerebrovascular lesions that may increase secondary damage and cause neuropsychological impairment. Previous studies suggest an association among the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cardiovascular disease, and cognitive performance. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor treatment on vascular injury, hypertension, brain ischemia, and cognitive functioning. In a sample of 73 moderate and severe TBI patients, the authors assessed whether cognitive sequelae differed in relation to the ACE I/D polymorphism. D allele carrier patients performed worse than those with I/I polymorphism on tests involving attention and processing speed. Findings suggest that the physiopathological changes associated with TBI may have greater consequences in ACE D allele carriers.", 
    "302": "Of all patients presenting with coronary, artery disease, 20-30% already have a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2. Of the remaining patients, another 15-20% are found at presentation to have diabetes mellitus and 30% have glucose intolerance. Both conditions are major risk factors for the recurrence of coronary artery disease and mortality. The treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 always includes improvement in lifestyle, adequate blood-glucose control, cholesterol-lowering therapy and blood-pressure control. Furthermore, if one or more other traditional cardiovascular risk factors are present, or if the patient is over 40 years of age, acetylsalicylic acid must be added. Finally, with a prior history of coronary-artery disease, patients must be given an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. During percutaneous coronary interventions, patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 are preferably treated with a drug-eluting stent in combination with clopidogrel, and in case of an acute coronary syndrome, glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists are added to the standard treatment.",

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected in 515 patients treated with chronic hemodialysis (HD) and rHuEPO. Patients were classified into five groups according to their antihypertensive treatment. The main outcomes of the study were the mean rHuEPO dosage and the prevalence of erythropoietin EPO resistance among the groups. Erythropoietin resistance was defined as a weekly rHuEPO dosage >300 units/kg/wk.",

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the development and progression of kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated renoprotection with the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in type 2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in type 1 diabetes. More recent studies have demonstrated similar cardiovascular benefits with the use of ARBs compared with ACEIs. The combination of the two classes of RAAS blockers has been investigated in large studies of patients with heart failure and after myocardial infarction, and a few small studies of patients with diabetic nephropathy. In this review, we summarized the results of the studies on the benefits of ARBs, ACEIs, and their combination in patients with diabetic nephropathy or cardiovascular diseases.",

During exposure the Captopril-treated group received intragastric captopril (60 mg/kg daily) and the Normal saline control group was administered with normal saline. The Model group had no treatment. At the 14th and 21st days of exposure, the subjects were sacrificed. The lung coefficient and the protein contents and inflammatory cells in BALF were determined.

    "316": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems responsible for the regulation of blood pressure. Recently the new physiological function of ACE has been revealed: the enzyme hydrolyses in vivo the natural peptide (N-AcSer-Asp-Lys-Pro), a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation. Somatic ACE is a single-chain glycoprotein, which contains two highly homologous domains (N- and C-domains, respectively), possessing a zinc-dependent active site. The domains differ in the rate of substrate hydrolysis, interaction with ACE inhibitors and chloride activation profiles. Specific ACE inhibitors used for treatment of hypertension, inhibit both domains, but their dissociation rates of enzyme-inhibitor complex are different. Selective binding of ACE inhibitors to either N- or C-domain may influence their biological effect during treatment. Different functional significance of these domains may be due to some differences in their thee-dimentional structures. X-ray structure of testicular ACE was recently solved and three-dimentional structure of N-domain was modeled. The structural features of domain active sites may be useful for construction of new selective inhibitors.",

    "320": "A novel human coronavirus (CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The spike (S) protein of this virus is a type I surface glycoprotein that mediates binding of the virus to the host receptor and the subsequent fusion between the viral and host membranes. Because of its critical role in viral entry, the S protein is an important target for the development of anti-SARS CoV therapeutics and prophylactics. This article reviews the structure and function of the SARS CoV S protein in the context of its role in virus entry. Topics that are discussed include: the interaction between the S1 domain of the SARS spike protein and the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the structural features of the ectodomain of ACE2; the antigenic determinants presented by the S protein and the nature of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that are elicited in vivo; the structure of the 4,3-hydrophobic heptad repeats HR1 and HR2 of the S2 domain and their interaction to form a six-helical bundle during the final stages of fusion. Opportunities for the design and development of anti-SARS agents based on the inhibition of receptor binding, the therapeutic uses of S-directed monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors of HR1-HR2 complex formation are presented.",

These observations are important because significant glycemic effects of drugs may be a source of accelerated cardiovascular risk that is not detectable during restricted clinical trial follow-up periods. The extent to which diabetes is affected by these medications remains unclear, as is the precise mechanism by which diabetes is promoted. However, several plausible theories are presented herein. Although drug-induced diabetes has been a concern for several years, not enough information is available to influence prescribing for the majority of patients. The number one priority should be controlling blood pressure in a timely manner.", 
    "322": "The increased risk for myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in primary hypertension suggests that the condition is associated with prothrombotic mechanisms. We have shown that patients with hypertension have an impaired capacity for acute endothelial tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release, an important local protective response to prevent formation of intravascular thrombi. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this impairment could be restored by the lowering of blood pressure. The capacity for acute t-PA release in response to intraarterial infusion of substance P at 8 pmol/min was investigated in a perfused-forearm study in 20 hypertensive patients (12 men and 8 women). Studies were performed when patients were untreated and after 8 weeks of randomized treatment with lisinopril or felodipine that lowered blood pressure by 26/10 and 24/12 mm Hg, respectively. The t-PA release response increased significantly with treatment (ANOVA, P=0.0001), with a similar effect in the 2 treatment groups. The peak release of t-PA increased from 257 (58) to 445 (77) ng/min x L/tissue(-1) (t test, P=0.02). Also, treatment shortened the average time to peak secretion from 6.7 (1.4) to 2.7 (0.3) min (t test, P=0.01). In 6 patients with a delayed secretory peak (9 minutes or later), treatment normalized the response (chi2 test, P=0.008). Antihypertensive therapy restores the capacity for acute t-PA release and improves the rapidity of the response in patients with primary hypertension. Similar responses with the 2 regimens suggest that the improvement is related to the blood pressure reduction as such. This effect may contribute to the thromboprotective effect of antihypertensive treatment.",

Two hundred four patients (49.0%) were men, 250 (60.8%) were hypertensive, and, in 171 (41.1%) cases, ischemic cardiopathy was the primary cause of the CHF. ACE inhibitors were prescribed to 210 patients (50.5%) on hospital release. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that, among patients with preserved SF, a longer survival was associated with ACE inhibitors use (mean survival 6.14 years as compared with 4.57 years in the control group, P < .001; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.63, P = .012). Similar results were obtained in CHF patients with deteriorated SF in whom those taking ACE inhibitors had significantly longer life with mean survival 6.42 years compared with 5.03 years in the control group (P < .001; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.62, P = .001).",

    "326": "Pain often outlasts its usefulness as warning and aid in wound healing, and becomes chronic and intractable after tissue damage and nerve injury. Many molecules have been implicated as mediators and modulators in persistent pain such as hyperalgesia and tactile pain (allodynia). We previously showed that prostaglandin (PG) E(2), PGF(2alpha) or the neuropeptide nociceptin, also called orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) administered intrathecally (i.t.) produced allodynia in conscious mice. In the present study, we examined the relationship of pain responses between PGs and N/OFQ using the N/OFQ receptor (NOP) antagonist, N-(4-amino-2-methylquinolin-6-yl)-2-(4-ethylphenoxy-methyl)benzamide monohydrochloride (JTC-801), and in mice lacking the N/OFQ prepropeptide (ppN/OFQ(-/-)) and the NOP receptor (NOP(-/-)). JTC-801 dose-dependently blocked the N/OFQ- and PGE(2)-induced allodynia, but not the PGF(2alpha)-induced one. Neither N/OFQ nor PGE(2) induced allodynia in NOP(-/-) mice. By contrast, the N/OFQ-induced allodynia was not affected by inhibition of PG production by a 60-min pretreatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin. Among PGE receptor (EP) subtype-selective agonists, the EP4 agonist, AE1-329, markedly stimulated the release of N/OFQ from spinal slices and induced allodynia. AE1-329 also increased nitric oxide production in spinal slices using fluorescent nitric oxide detection, which was blocked by pretreatment with JTC-801. Conversely, PGE(2)-induced allodynia was not observed in ppN/OFQ(-/-) mice. N/OFQ immunoreactive puncta were colocalized with EP4. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PGE(2) induced allodynia by stimulation of N/OFQ release in the spinal cord via EP4 receptor subtypes.", 
    "327": "It is assumed that endothelial dysfunction due to arterial hypertension could be improved or even normalized by antihypertensive treatment. The present study was designed to explore that assumption in patients with essential hypertension treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-enalapril. Twenty-eight patients (mean age: 55.1 years) who fulfilled the following criteria were included: essential arterial hypertension present for more than 2 years, monotherapy with enalapril for at least 1 year, adequate treatment (blood pressure in the last year <140/90 mm Hg) and absence of other factors (smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity), which could importantly influence endothelial function. The flow-mediated (endothelium-dependent) dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery was assessed by high-resolution ultrasound and compared with that of 22 age-matched healthy normotensive controls. The patients and controls did not differ in regard to body mass index, lipids, and plasma glucose and insulin; there were no smokers. FMD of the brachial artery was significantly decreased in patients in comparison to controls (7.9% vs 13.5%, p<0.01). FMD in patients was inversely correlated with the duration of hypertension (r = -0.52, p<0.01) and with both systolic (r = -0.72, p<0.01) and diastolic (r = -0.43, p<0.05) blood pressure (measured after temporary withdrawal of treatment). This study showed that the adequate control of blood pressure achieved with enalapril is not followed by normalization of endothelial function, measured by FMD of the brachial artery.",

Peak oxygen consumption ( VO2) values were 1,209 +/-366 and 1,284 +/-398 mL/minute before and after the study (p = 0.01). Anaerobic threshold VO2 values were 785 +/-187 and 855 +/-217 mL/minute before and after the study, respectively (p = 0.01). Peak heart rates (HR) were 141 +/-28 and 143 +/-22/minute (p = 0.35); peak VO2/HR values were 9.02 +/-3.1 and 9.3 +/-3 mL/minute (p = 0.4) before and after the study, respectively. On the other hand, in the control group, average exercise times were 556 +/-250 and 528 +/-251 seconds (p = 0.8); peak VO2 values were 1,502 +/-537 and 1,450 +/-501 mL/minute (p = 0.2); and anaerobic threshold VO2 values were 1,005 +/-338 and 975 +/-319 mL/min (p = 0.7), before and after the study respectively. At the highest comparable exercise stage for both tests in the study group the expired volume/oxygen consumption ( VE/ VO2) ratio declined from 35.1 +/-6.2 to 32.4 +/-5.6 (p = 0.007). VE values declined from 37.5 +/-10.9 to 33.9 +/-10.1 L (p = 0.02); heart rate declined from 140 +/-27 to 132 +/-21/minute (p = 0.02). No significant change was observed in the mentioned values for the control group. Addition of losartan to the standard therapy in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction improved exercise capacity and caused lower heart rate and ventilation requirements for the same exercise level.", 
    "329": "The incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) owing to diabetes has continued to increase despite the extensive use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to prevent diabetic nephropathy, primarily from evidence of short-term effectiveness. We assessed the long-term effect of ACE inhibitors on the risk of ESRD. We formed a population-based cohort of all diabetic patients treated with antihypertensive drugs in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, between 1982 and 1986. The patients were followed up to the end of 1997 to identify cases of end-stage renal failure. A nested case-control analysis was used with the controls matched to each case on age, diabetes type, and duration of follow-up. The cohort comprised 6102 subjects, of which the 102 cases who developed end-stage renal failure were matched to 4129 controls. Relative to thiazide diuretic use, the adjusted rate ratio of end-stage renal failure associated with the use of ACE inhibitors was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3-4.7), whereas it was 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.5-1.4) for beta-blockers and 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.4-1.3) for calcium antagonists. The rate ratio of end-stage renal failure with the use of ACE inhibitors was 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.3-2.5) during the first 3 years of follow-up, but increased to 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.0-9.0) after 3 years. ACE-inhibitor use does not appear to decrease the long-term risk of end-stage renal failure in diabetes. Our data suggest instead that ACE inhibitors might actually increase this risk, which may possibly contribute to the continued increasing incidence of ESRD owing to diabetes.", 
    "330": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF) are commonly encountered together, and either condition predisposes to the other. Risk factors for AF and CHF include age, hypertension, valve disease, and myocardial infarction, as well as a variety of medical conditions and genetic variants. Congestive heart failure and AF share common mechanisms, including myocardial fibrosis and dysregulation of intracellular calcium and neuroendocrine function. Pharmacological treatments including beta-blockers, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can be useful in treating both of these conditions. Antiarrhythmic medications intended to achieve and maintain sinus rhythm may be beneficial in some patients with AF and CHF. Advances in pacemaker and defibrillator therapy, including cardiac resynchronization therapy, may also benefit patients with AF and CHF. Surgical and catheter-based ablation therapy can restore sinus rhythm in patients with AF, with proven benefit in patients with concommitant CHF. Investigational biologic therapy, including cell and gene based therapy, offers promise for the future of reversing the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie AF and CHF.", 
    "331": "Improved exercise capacity in chronic heart failure (CHF) has been attributed to restoration of endothelial function. ACE inhibitors as well as beta blockers have previously been shown to enhance endothelial function and exercise capacity. The aim of this study was to determine whether short-term improvement in submaximal exercise capacity induced by optimized therapy with ACE inhibitors in combination with beta blockers is associated with restoration of endothelial function in CHF patients.", 
    "332": "Thirty-three patients with CHF were evaluated: six-minute walk test, NYHA class, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), big Endothelin-1 (bigET-1) and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery were assessed at baseline and after a 3-month period of optimized neurohormonal therapy. Two groups were formed retrospectively based on the changes in submaximal exercise capacity (responders and non-responders).", 
    "333": "Optimization of neurohormonal therapy was comparable between groups. Responders (n=17) revealed a significant increase in walking distance (304+/-109 to 441+/-75 m; p<0.01), which was paralleled by a decrease in NYHA class (2.7+/-0.6 to 2.0+/-0.4; p<0.01), BNP (484+/-454 to 243+/-197 pg/ml; p<0.01), and bigET-1 (2.0+/-0.9 vs. 1.5+/-0.6 fmol/ml; p=0.04). By contrast, the latter variables did not change in non-responders. Improvement in functional capacity in responders was associated with an increase in FMD (8.2+/-3.9% to 11.0+/-5.6%; p<0.05). Increments in FMD were directly correlated with increases in walking distance (r=0.34; p<0.05).",

    "335": "The renin-angiotensin system is a key regulatory system that is activated in many forms of cardiovascular disease. It is well established that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are important therapeutic agents in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. More recent research has suggested that renin-angiotensin system activation may also play a critical role in the genesis of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The possible role of renin-angiotensin system activation in arrhythmogenesis suggests that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be important therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of arrhythmias. This review summarizes the current evidence for the use of ARBs in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "336": "Left atrial (LA) enlargement, left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, and increased arterial stiffness are all associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The rate, magnitude, and concordance of modifiability of these risk markers have not been well characterized. Twenty-one patients (mean age 69 +/- 8 years; 52% women) with isolated diastolic dysfunction and indexed LA volumes > or =32 ml/m(2) were randomly assigned to receive either quinapril at a target dose of 60 mg/day or matching placebo for 12 months. Echocardiographic maximum LA volume and LV diastolic function and arterial stiffness by the augmentation index were measured at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Analysis was based on intention to treat. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment (n = 9) and placebo (n = 12) groups. The mean reduction in LA volume of 4.2 +/- 7.8 ml/m(2) in the quinapril group was significant (p = 0.01) compared with the increase in LA volume in the placebo group (5.5 +/- 8.1 ml/m(2)). This represents a relative improvement of 9.7 ml/m(2). Change in LV filling pressure in terms of E/e' and diastolic function grade did not reach significance. A reduction in the augmentation index was associated with a decrease in indexed LA volume (odds ratio 11, p = 0.046), independent of changes in systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, LA structural remodeling appeared reversible with quinapril, which occurred in parallel with an improvement in arterial stiffness but independent of blood pressure changes.", 
    "337": "A cross-sectional study was conducted among 517 patients with diabetes mellitus at all health centres in Melaka Tengah District to examine whether these patients and their associated cardiovascular risk factors were managed according to current guidelines. All patients had Type 2 diabetes mellitus with mean age of 57.9 +/- 10.5 years and the mean duration of diabetes was 7.2 +/- 6.0 years. The glycaemic control was poor with 53.6% of the patients having HbAlc above 8% (mean = 8.5%) and 24% of them had microalbuminuria. Among these patients with poor glycaemic control, about 47.6% of them were on monotherapy. Three hundred and fifty (67.7%) patients had hypertension but only 11 (3.1%) achieved target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg. Only 18.3% of the diabetics with hypertension were prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and 0.3% with angiotensin receptor blockers. Nearly two-third of them had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than 2.6 mmol/l (mean = 3.4 mmol/l) but only 6.8% were prescribed lipid-lowering agents. Aspirin was prescribed to 8.2% of diabetics aged above 40 years. Sixteen percent of the patients smoked, 53% did not do any exercise, and the mean BMI was 26.8 kg/mn. The management of diabetes mellitus and its associated cardiovascular risk factors was suboptimal on the basis of current clinical guidelines. A greater effort in educating doctors in the health centres about these management and adherence to the guidelines is important in reducing patients' risk of cardiovascular disease and its associated morbidity and mortality.",

    "340": "The number of recurrent coronary events for a year was significantly more in patients with ACS and DM. Such patients had initially lower activity of catalase, higher blood glucose, circulating immune complexes, creatinine, urinary protein. The lowest catalase activity was in DM patients who had recurrent infarction or died. Low catalse activity was accompanied with the highest blood creatinine and protein, more severe systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. Compared to captopril, administration of lisinopril in hospital increased catalase activity, lowered blood creatinine, eliminated protein in the urine. These changes were associated with a significantfall in the number of cases with progressive chronic cardiac failure and lethal outcomes.", 
    "341": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been recognized for many years as critical pathway for blood pressure control and kidney functions. Although most of the well-known cardiovascular and renal effects of RAS are attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), much less is known about the function of ACE2. Experiments using genetically modified mice and inhibitor studies have shown that ACE2 counterbalances the functions of ACE and that the balance between these two proteases determines local and systemic levels of RAS peptides such as angiotensin II and angiotensin1-7. Ace2 mutant mice exhibit progressive impairment of heart contractility at advanced ages, a phenotype that can be reverted by loss of ACE, suggesting that these enzymes directly control heart function. Moreover, ACE2 is also found to be upregulated in failing hearts. In the kidney, ACE2 protein levels are significantly decreased in hypertensive rats, suggesting a negative regulatory role of ACE2 in blood pressure control. Moreover, ACE2 expression is downregulated in the kidneys of diabetic and pregnant rats and ACE2 mutant mice develop late onset glomerulonephritis resembling diabetic nephropathy. Importantly, ACE2 not only controls angiotensin II levels but functions as a protease on additional molecular targets that could contribute to the observed in vivo phenotypes of ACE2 mutant mice. Thus, ACE2 seems to be a molecule that has protective roles in heart and kidney. The development of drugs that could activate ACE2 function would allow extending our treatment options in diabetic nephropathy, heart failure, or hypertension.", 
    "342": "All the components of the kallikrein-kinin system are located in the cardiac muscle, and its deficiency may lead to cardiac dysfunction. In recent years, numerous observations obtained from clinical and experimental models of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure, ischemia, myocardial infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy have suggested that the reduced activity of the local kallikrein-kinin system may be instrumental for the induction of cardiovascular-related diseases. The cardioprotective property of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is primarily mediated via kinin-releasing pathway, which may cause regression of the left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive situations. The ability of kallikrein gene delivery to produce a wide spectrum of beneficial effects makes it an excellent candidate in treating hypertension, cardiovascular and renal diseases. In addition, stable kinin agonists may also be available in the future as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular and renal disorders.", 
    "343": "A sensitive and rapid method for determination of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was developed based on a combination of enzymatic reaction followed by high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) determination of its product. The most commonly used substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL) or hippuryl-glycyl-glycine (HGG) hydrolysis catalyzed by purified rabbit lung ACE or human plasma ACE was investigated in the presence of benazeprilat. The incubation time was 8 min for purified lung ACE, and 16 min for human plasma ACE. The produced hippuric acid (HA) was separated from substrate HHL or HGG by HPLC on a C(18) column with isocratic elution within 6.5 min, and quantified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with p-phthalic acid as an internal standard (IS). The limit of detection of HA was 6.0 ng/ml. HHL or HGG hydrolysis catalyzed by purified lung ACE displayed excellent accuracy and reproducibility. The small total reaction volume, the low concentration of substrate, and the simple treating procedures present the advantages of the new method. Furthermore, the total time of the whole procedure for one sample with the novel method is less than 1/2 of that of the conventional HPLC or spectrophotometry method, while the accuracy and the precision of the new method are almost the same as the conventional HPLC method with UV detection.", 
    "344": "Bradykinin is both a potent vasodilatator and a central inflammatory mediator. Similar to findings in myocardial reperfusion injury, bradykinin might mediate the protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition after liver ischemia via increased bradykinin-2-receptor (B-2) stimulation. On the other hand, B-2-inhibition has been shown to reduce liver reperfusion injury. This study was designed to investigate the role of Bradykinin in hepatic reperfusion injury.", 
    "345": "Twenty eight rats were allocated randomly to Sham procedure (Sham), 30-min normothermic ischemia (ischemia), ischemia with Ramiprilat (ACE-I), or ischemia with Ramiprilat and B-2-inhibitor HOE 140 (ACE-I+B-2-I). Liver microcirculation and leukocyte adherence were investigated using intravital microscopy 30 min after reperfusion (n = 7 per group). In addition, serum activities of AST and ALT were measured for 7 days (n = 28).", 
    "346": "Ischemia was associated with a loss of perfused sinusoids, sinusoidal vasoconstriction, and a reduction in microvascular blood flow. Permanent leukocyte adherence increased both in sinusoids and in postsinusoidal venoles. ACE-I restored sinusoidal perfusion, normalized vasoregulation, maintained sinusoidal blood flow, and inhibited leukocyte adhesion. ACE-I+B-2-I abolished the protective effects linked to ACE-I. Ischemia-induced liver cell injury after 5 h of reperfusion was ameliorated by ACE-I. In the ACE-I+B-2-I group, reduction in liver cell injury was reversed.",

    "348": "Over half of the people with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may be asymptomatic. The most common symptom of mild-to-moderate PAD is intermittent claudication, present in about one third of symptomatic patients. Patients with intermittent claudication often have severely impaired functional status. Despite the high prevalence of the disease and the strong association with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, patients with PAD are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than are those being treated for coronary artery disease. The goals of treatment are to prevent progression of systemic atherosclerosis and its associated morbidity and mortality, to prevent limb loss, and to improve functional capacity for symptomatic patients. For claudicating patients, medical management includes symptomatic treatment with cilostazol or pentoxifylline. For all patients, it is equally important to pursue risk reduction through exercise programs and promotion of smoking cessation, as well as with the use of statins, antiplatelet therapies, antithrombotic strategies, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and attention to homocysteine levels. Because not all patients are symptomatic, medical management of peripheral arterial disease may proceed along an algorithmic pathway that recognizes 3 types of patients: those requiring risk reduction only, symptomatic patients with minimal lifestyle limitation, and symptomatic patients with significant lifestyle impairment.",

In this article, current thinking on medical therapy for carotid atherosclerosis is outlined, including aggressive use of statins, targeted blood pressure lowering, and antithrombotic therapy. Implementation of these therapies will likely reduce the need for revascularization procedures in the future.", 
    "368": "We tested the hypothesis that blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors reduces oxidative stress markers in parallel with urinary albumin and type IV collagen excretions. Sixty-six diabetic patients with nephropathy were randomly assigned to either the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB; n=33) or trichlormethiazide (n=33) group. The majority of patients had been treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers for > or =1 year before the present study. Reduction of blood pressure was not different between the 2 groups, and HbA1c levels did not change over the study period (8 weeks). Treatment with ARB (candesartan 8 mg/day, n=11 or valsartan 80 mg/day, n=22) for 8 weeks reduced the levels of plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin 6, urinary 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, albumin, and type IV collagen, whereas the levels of these markers were not altered with trichlormethiazide (2 mg/day). Significant correlation was observed between the reduction of the urinary 8-epi- prostaglandin F2alpha and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and those of the urinary albumin and type IV collagen. Subjects with large oxidative stress had large reduction rates because of ARB administration and showed large urinary albumin suppression. These results suggest that ARBs reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic patients independent of their effects on blood pressure. In addition, increases in oxidative stress caused by angiotensin II may play an important role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our results may help to explain the clinical observation that ARB reduces urinary albumin excretion very efficiently in some patients but not in others.",

An ageing population, sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet are considered to have contributed toward this. What we must now consider is not only the burden of the disease but the complications that arise from diabetes, in particular kidney and heart disease. Foremost, more than half of the diabetic population will die from cardiovascular-related causes. Whilst diabetes is most often associated with hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity, these factors do not fully account for the increased burden of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. This strengthens the need for comprehensive studies investigating the underlying mechanisms mediating diabetic cardiovascular disease, and more specifically, diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. In addition to the recognised metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes, upregulation of putative pathological pathways such as advanced glycation endproducts, renin-angiotensin system, oxidative stress and increased expression of growth factors and cytokines have been observed in the setting of diabetes. All of these have been shown to play a causal role in atherosclerotic plaque formation and thus may explain the increased risk of macrovascular complications in those patients with diabetes. In this review the effect of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and a comparison to angiotensin II receptor antagonism is discussed, with the results of clinical trails reflecting the more recently discovered, non-haemodynamic, proatherogenic actions of angiotensin II. The need for experimental models of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis will be covered, with particular emphasis given to the streptozotocin-diabetic apolipoprotein E knockout mouse. Finally, growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor are discussed in detail.", 
    "374": "It is generally accepted that hypertension doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease, of which coronary heart disease is the most common and lethal. Hypertension is a predisposing factor for the development of stroke, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure and end-state renal disease. Atherosclerosis-causing coronary heart disease is related to the severity of hypertension. Inhibition of calcium entry reduces the active tone of vascular smooth muscle and produces vasodilatation. This pharmacological action has been the basis for the use of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) for the management of hypertension. Other drug families may achieve this: diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists. Cardiovascular hypertrophy and atherosclerosis are major complications related to high blood pressure. Cardiac hypertrophy is considered as an independent risk factor associated with abnormalities of diastolic function and can result in heart failure. Atherosclerosis is associated with activation of innate immunity. Atherosclerosis is expressing itself not only as coronary heart disease, but as a cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease. By impairing physiological vasomotor function, atherosclerosis includes ultimately necrosis of myocardium. CCBs reduce blood pressure. Do they prevent the progress of the main complications of hypertension? This major question is the matter of the present paper.", 
    "375": "Chronic kidney diseases frequently advance to end-stage renal failure, and the number of patients affected is steadily increasing worldwide. At the molecular level, progression of renal insufficiency correlates closely with ongoing pathological matrix protein expansion (i.e., renal fibrosis), in a manner independent of the underlying disorder. Overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system and of the TGF-beta system have been identified as key mediators of kidney matrix accumulation, and are principal targets in the management of chronic renal disease. This review provides a recent overview of the therapeutic options that are clinically established, and of novel molecular strategies that will approach clinical practice in the near future.", 
    "376": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), a main effector peptide in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), plays a fundamental role as a vasoconstrictor in controlling cardiovascular function and renal homeostasis. Ang II also acts as a growth promoter or angiogenic factor via type 1 angiotensin II receptors (AT1Rs) in certain tumour cell lines. Recent studies have shown the activation of the local RAS in various tumour tissues, including the abundant generation of Ang II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the upregulation of AT1R expression. Thus, considerable attention has been paid to the role of the RAS in cancer and its blockade as a new approach to the treatment of cancer. There is increasing evidence that the Ang II-AT1R system is involved in tumour growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in experimental models, suggesting the therapeutic potential of an ACE inhibitor and AT1R blocker, both of which have been used as antihypertensive drugs. In addition, specific Ang II-degrading enzymes are expressed in tumours and play a regulatory role in cell proliferation and invasion. This review focuses on the role of the Ang II-AT1R system in solid tumours, particularly in the progression of gynaecological cancer, and presents the clinical potential of manipulating the angiotensin system as a novel and promising strategy for cancer treatment.",

    "385": "Tubulointerstitial (TI) fibrosis is a final common pathway to progressive renal injury of all forms of renal disease. However, once renal damage reaches a certain threshold, progression of renal disease is consistent, irreversible, and largely independent of the initial injury. Angiotensin (AT) II is the main effector of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and effects that may contribute to the onset and progression of renal damage. AT II may also directly contribute to accelerate renal damage by sustaining cell growth, inflammation, and fibrosis. Interventions that inhibit the activity of the RAS are renoprotective and may retard or even halt the progression of chronic nephropathies. Unilateral ureteral obstruction suggested as a well-established experimental model of progressive interstitial expansion and fibrosis. Although technically challenging, some investigators have successfully relieved the obstruction and reported significant reduction in interstitial fibrosis severity. Drugs that modulate the RAS, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists, have demonstrated protective renal effects and can ameliorate fibrosis. However, neither ACE inhibitor nor AT1 receptor blockade completely suppresses progression of renal disease. Dual blockade of the RAS with ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers may provide renal benefit beyond therapy with either drug alone, due to their potential additive beneficial effect.",

Early identification of patients at high risk of developing renal failure is of great importance as it may allow specific measures to delay the progression of renal damage and thus reduce the incidence of end-stage renal failure and mortality. Early predictors of renal impairment in HbS/beta-thal remain to explore. Within this context, we studied 87 compound HbS/beta-thal patients (36 males/51 females; median age 39 years) and 30 healthy controls. In addition to conventional renal biochemistries we measured serum cystatin-C (Cys-C), urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) excretion and serum and urinary beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M). Cystatin-C, NAG and serum beta(2)-M levels were higher in patients than controls. The incidence of patients with high levels of Cys-C, NAG, and beta(2)-M was 32.1, 74.7, and 70.1% respectively, while only 6.8% of patients had increased serum creatinine levels. Cystatin-C and serum beta(2)-M showed a strong correlation with creatinine clearance and age, while NAG positively correlated with proteinuria. An inverse correlation was also shown between hemoglobin and beta(2)-M, NAG, and Cys-C levels. Seven patients with proteinuria received therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Changes of poteinuria positively correlated with NAG levels. These results indicate that Cys-C is an accurate marker of renal dysfunction, and urinary NAG excretion can be considered as a reliable index of the tubular toxicity, and possible predictor of proteinuria and eventual renal impairment in HbS/beta-thal patients. Furthermore, NAG measurement may be used for monitoring ACE-inhibitors therapy in HbS/beta-thal patients with proteinuria.",

An apparatus that measures the nonlinear optical response of a sample through second harmonic generation (SHG) is described. The response of several enalapril maleate-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) tablets was measured, the results of which were used to determine the concentration of the drug. The current limit of detection of the apparatus was found to be approximately 1%-2%. Ranitidine hydrochloride (RN) polymorph forms I and II were also characterized using SHG. It was found that pure samples of forms I and II could be clearly and rapidly distinguished. Mixtures consisting of 50% form I and 50% form II were also distinguishable from the respective pure forms. An investigation was performed into the size dependence of the SHG response for crystalline lactose. It was found that the SHG response was a slowly decreasing monotonic function of particle size. Additional investigation into the angular dependence of the scattered SHG light was also undertaken for crystalline lactose.

It is observed that the trans isomer of the drug binds more strongly to Ag(+) between pH 5 and 8, as shown by the broadening of the trans isomer's resonances in (13)C NMR spectra on complexation. A monodentate complexation of the trans captopril with Ag(+) via the thiol site is proposed based on the solid-state NMR and IR data.

    "413": "An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) reduces cardiac remodeling and a bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) antagonist partially abolishes this ACE-I effect. However, bradykinin has two different types of receptor, the B1 receptor (B1R) and B2R. Although B1R is induced under several pathological conditions, including hypertension, the role of cardiac B1R in hypertension is not clear. We therefore investigated the role of cardiac B1R in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The B1R mRNA expression level in the heart was significantly higher in SHR-SP than in WKY rats. Chronic infusion of a B1R antagonist for 4 weeks significantly elevated blood pressure and left-ventricular weight of SHR-SP. Morphological analysis indicated that cardiomyocyte size and cardiac fibrosis significantly increased after administration of the B1R antagonist. The phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, including ERK, p38, and JNK, was significantly increased in the hearts of SHR-SP rats receiving the B1R antagonist. The TGF-beta1 expression level was significantly increased in SHR-SP rats treated with the B1R antagonist compared to that in WKY rats. The B1R antagonist significantly increased phosphorylation of Thr495 in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is an inhibitory site of eNOS. These results suggest that the role of B1R in the heart may be attenuation of cardiac remodeling via inhibition of the expression of MAP kinases and TGF-beta1 through an increase in eNOS activity in a hypertensive condition.",

Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor (PAI-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) are haemostatic markers of endothelial injury related to hypertension. Hypertensive status is also accompanied by high fibrinogen (Fb) levels and blood platelet activation. The influence of RAA system on haemostatic disorders is mainly due to the action of angiotensin II (Ang II) on PAI-1 synthesis by endothelial cells. Ang II is generated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). It is believed that genes encoding PAI-1 and ACE may interact and regulate the delicate balance in the haemostatic system. The aim of this study was to: (1) compare hypertensive and normotensive subjects with regard to haemostatic factors; (2) assess the effect of ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms on haemostatic parameters in patients with essential hypertension as compared with normotensive subjects; (3) determine whether lipid disturbances modify the influence of ACE and PAI-1 gene polymorphisms on haemostatic factors; (4) investigate if there is an interaction of ACE and PAI-1 gene polymorphisms with haemostatic parameters in patients with essential hypertension.",

The use of both these drugs, particularly if used in association, leads to the onset of a clinical picture of variable entity, characterized mainly by a hypertrophy originating usually at the level of interdental papillae, and more pronounced in the anterior maxillary areas and the vestibular surfaces of the teeth, in a more or less symptomatic manner.

When there is a clinical suspicion of heart failure, further assessment is required to confirm the aetiology. In older patients, heart failure with normal systolic function is frequently encountered. However, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction usually have a poorer prognosis, and most treatments have been evaluated in these patients. Useful investigations include the 12-lead electrocardiogram, chest radiology and echocardiography. A blood test for B-type natriuretic peptide is being increasingly used as a 'rule out' test for heart failure. There are several treatment options. Initially, patients should be treated with a diuretic and ACE inhibitor, provided there are no contraindications. beta-Blocker therapy is also first-line therapy once a patients' haemodynamic status has been stabilized. Additional treatments include spironolactone, angiotensin antagonists and digoxin. Patient factors and tolerability may limit the number of treatment options.

    "423": "Angiotensinogen-, angiotensin-converting enzyme-, and angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT(1)R)-deficient mice exhibit a dilated renal pelvis (hydronephrosis) and a small papilla. These abnormalities have been attributed to impaired development of the ureteral and pelvic smooth muscle. Defects in the growth and branching of the ureteric bud (UB), which gives rise to the collecting system, have not been examined carefully. This study tested the hypothesis that Ang II stimulates UB growth and branching in the intact metanephros. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that embryonic mouse kidneys express AT(1)R in the UB and its branches. Embryonic day 11.5 metanephroi were microdissected from Hoxb7-green fluorescence protein mice and grown for 48 h in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of Ang II. The number of green fluorescence protein-positive UB branch points (BP) and tips was monitored in each explant at 24 and 48 h. Ang II increased the number of UB tips and BP at 24 h (tips: 24.3 +/- 1.1 versus 18.3 +/- 0.7, P < 0.01; BP: 14.4 +/- 0.6 versus 11.7 +/- 0.6, P < 0.01) and 48 h (tips: 30.2 +/- 1.3 versus 22.9 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01; BP: 21.3 +/- 0.9 versus 15.7 +/- 0.6, P < 0.01) compared with control. In contrast, treatment of metanephroi with the AT(1)R antagonist candesartan inhibited UB branching, decreasing the number of UB tips and BP. Similarly, inhibition of EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity abrogated Ang II-stimulated UB branching. A cross-talk between the renin-angiotensin system and EGFR signaling was elicited at the cellular level by the ability of Ang II to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in UB cells and through abrogation of Ang II-induced UB cell branching using an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These data demonstrate that Ang II, acting via the AT(1)R, stimulates UB branching morphogenesis. This process depends on tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR.

The distinctive pathogenic process involves sequential or concomitant abnormalities in blood vessel function, immunity and, ultimately, fibroblast function. These specific characteristics may explain the results of treatment evaluations. The decrease in excess mortality shown in recent studies seems chiefly ascribable to the use of cardiovascular drugs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in resolving renal crisis, prostacyclins and endothelin antagonists improve pulmonary hypertension, and calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors benefit patients with myocardial involvement. On the other hand, immunomodulatory drugs and other agents investigated for their disease-modifying potential failed to influence skin fibrosis in controlled trials. Trials of immunosuppressants are ongoing. Available results indicate that emphasis should be put on cardiovascular drugs. The development of criteria for disease activity and severity would facilitate future research on the treatment of systemic sclerosis.", 
    "425": "Discovery of the chemical structure of alligator (Alligator mississipiensis) [Asp(1), Val(5), Ala(9)]-Angiotensin I (ANG I) has permitted the investigation of cardiovascular responses to this peptide and its analogs in spectacled caimans (Caiman crocodilus), close relatives of alligators. ANG I and [Asp(1), Val(5)]- Angiotensin II (ANG II) i.v. gave dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure but there was no pressor response to [Val(4)]-ANG III (ANG III). Pressor responses to a series of doses of ANG II were compared with a range of doses of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) which were found to be only about 1/100 as potent as ANG II on a molar basis. The replacement of d-leu(10)in the alligator ANG I molecule with l-leu(10) almost stopped its conversion to ANG II and attenuated the pressor response. [Asp(1), Val(5), Ala(9)]-ANG I (1-9), and ANG (1-7) both failed to increase arterial blood pressure, even at the relatively high non-physiological test dose of 194pmolkgbw(-1) i.v. Captopril blocked angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and prevented the pressor response to ANG I whereas the mammalian AT(1) inhibitor Losartan attenuated, but did not completely block the pressor response to ANG II. These are the first experiments which test the cardiovascular responses to alligator ANG I and its analogues in any crocodilian species.", 
    "426": "Despite efforts to diagnose and treat hypertension effectively, the goal of lowering blood pressure (BP) levels is rarely achieved, as treatment is often initiated with a single antihypertensive agent. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a first-line fixed-dose combination treatment compared with treatment with its monocomponents over a period of 4 weeks. Patients (n = 149) with essential hypertension were randomised to receive 2.5 mg of either ramipril or felodipine ER or the fixed-dose combination of ramipril 2.5 mg/felodipine ER 2.5 mg over a 4-week treatment period. BP and heart rate were measured by conventional methodology and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Treatment with the fixed-dose combination was significantly more effective in reducing systolic and diastolic BP (-15.8/-9.2 mmHg) compared with its monocomponents, ramipril (-7.6/-3.8 mmHg) and felodipine ER (-8.0/-5.0 mmHg). No significant difference could be observed in the occurrence of a greater fall in systolic and diastolic BP 6 h after the first dose of the three study medications. The adverse effects reported were mild, and less number of patients in the fixed-dose combination complained of adverse events. It can be concluded that initiating antihypertensive treatment with a low fixed-dose combination of ramipril/felodipine ER is more effective and safe when compared with treatment with its monocomponents.", 
    "427": "This article reviews reports of ACE inhibitor use in pediatric heart failure and summarizes the present implications for clinical practice. Captopril, enalapril, and cilazapril are orally active ACE inhibitors, and widely used in pediatric cardiology, although more than ten other ACE inhibitors have been applied clinically in adults. Effects of ACE inhibitors on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults. ACE inhibitors lower aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance, do not affect pulmonary vascular resistance significantly, and lower left atrial and right atrial pressures in pediatric patients with heart failure. In infants with a large ventricular septal defect and pulmonary hypertension, ACE inhibitors decrease left-to-right shunt in those infants with elevated systemic vascular resistance. ACE inhibitors induce a small increase in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular fractional shortening, and systemic blood flow in children with left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and aortic regurgitation. These beneficial effects usually persist long term without the development of tolerance. Therapeutic trials of ACE inhibitors have been reported in children with heart failure and divergent hemodynamics, including myocardial dysfunction, left-to-right shunt, such as large ventricular septal defect and pulmonary hypertension, aortic or mitral regurgitation, and Fontan circulation. Hypotension and renal failure usually occur within 5 days after starting ACE inhibition or increasing the dose and, in most cases, recovery is seen after reduction or cessation of the drug. With all ACE inhibitors, smaller doses are administered initially to prevent excessive hypotension, and doses are increased gradually to the target dose. Captopril is administered orally, usually every 8 hours. Daily doses range from 0.3 to 1.5 mg/kg in children. Enalapril is administered orally, once or twice a day, and daily doses range from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg. Enalaprilat is administered intravenously, one to three times a day, in doses ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg/dose. For the treatment of chronic heart failure in children, ACE inhibitors are essential along with other medications including diuretics, digoxin, and beta-blockers (beta-adrenoceptor antagonists).", 
    "428": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) has taken on epidemic proportions in the United States, with approximately 550,000 new cases annually. With the evolution of pharmacotherapy targeting neurohormonal pathways over the past 2 decades, the annual mortality in subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV has dramatically improved from 52% in the seminal CONSENSUS trial to less than 20% in more recent trials in CHF. Suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with various angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been proven to save lives in several large-scale trials of CHF, and all of them can be used at doses tested in clinical trials without clear preference of one over another. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can be used in place of ACE inhibitors in the case of ACE inhibitor intolerance with comparable results. However, some inconsistencies exist between trials with ARBs, and it is uncertain if the ARBs tested in clinical trials provide comparable clinical benefit whether used in place of or in combination with ACE inhibitors. Once ACE inhibition has been started, beta blockade should follow for all subjects with symptomatic CHF. Triple neurohormonal blockade can then be accomplished with the addition of an aldosterone receptor or ARB. Regardless of the exact agent used or sequence of initiation, the critical importance of careful monitoring of neurohormonal blockade cannot be overstated. Renal failure and hyperkalemia are the most important complications of suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and an increase in hospital admissions and death from hyperkalemia after publication of the RALES trial illustrates the danger of \"casual\" use of neurohormonal blockers. In light of the tremendous benefits of neurohormonal blockade, the only conclusion from these data is to initiate RAAS-blocking agents following the safety precautions tested in the respective clinical trials.",

    "433": "An estimated 50% of patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery require intravenous antihypertensive therapy to manage life-threatening arterial bleeding, myocardial ischemia, or cardiac failure in the perioperative period. Managing hypertension in this setting can be challenging because of the need to reduce blood pressure while maintaining adequate end organ perfusion. Hypotensive episodes can increase the risk of cardiac complications and end organ hypoperfusion, particularly in patients whose underlying cardiovascular disease has altered autoregulation of blood flow. To decrease the risk of hypertensive or hypotensive episodes, blood pressure is monitored continuously, and short-acting intravenous antihypertensive agents are administered in an effort to target a mean arterial pressure generally within 20% of the patient's baseline value. Efforts to optimize end organ perfusion and avoid recognized adverse drug effects may influence the choice of antihypertensive agents. The ideal agent for postoperative hypertension should have a rapid onset of action, be highly vascular selective, and be rapidly reversible. In addition, it should be safe, with little risk of overshoot hypotension or adverse drug reaction. Precise management of arterial pressure in the perioperative period has the potential to improve clinical outcome by avoiding hypotensive episodes, ensuring adequate end organ perfusion, decreasing the risk of adverse drug effects, and serving as a bridge to definitive long-term therapy for essential hypertension.",

Coronary artery disease (CAD) and other atherosclerotic vascular disorders may coexist with PAD. Persons with PAD are at increased risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and mortality from CAD. Smoking should be stopped and hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and hypothyroidism treated. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and improve exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in persons with PAD and hypercholesterolaemia. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel (especially the latter), ACE inhibitors and statins should be given to all persons with PAD. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists should be given if CAD is present. The phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor cilostazol improves exercise time until intermittent claudication. Chelation therapy should be avoided.

This strengthens the need for comprehensive studies investigating the underlying mechanisms mediating diabetic cardiovascular disease and, more specifically, diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. In addition to the recognized metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes mellitus, upregulation of putative pathological pathways such as advanced glycation end products, the renin-angiotensin system, oxidative stress, and increased expression of growth factors and cytokines have been shown to play a causal role in atherosclerotic plaque formation and may explain the increased risk of macrovascular complications. This review discusses the methods used to assess the development of atherosclerosis in the clinic as well as addressing novel biomarkers of atherosclerosis, such as low-density lipoprotein receptor-1. Experimental models of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis are discussed, such as the streptozocin-induced diabetic apolipoprotein E knockout mouse. Results of major clinical trials with inhibitors of putative atherosclerotic pathways are presented.

    "469": "We investigated the relationship between urocortin and the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays a key role in producing the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II). Urocortin was acutely and subchronically administered to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and then the serum and tissue (lung and aorta) ACE levels were evaluated. The tissue ACE mRNA was determined by using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Immunofluorescence studies were also preformed to evaluate the effect of urocortin on ACE in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs). Urocortin decreased the serum ACE level 1h after administration, whereas tissue ACE immunoreactivity and mRNA did not change. The prolonged administration of urocortin enhanced tissue ACE activity but the serum ACE level remained low. RT-PCR analysis showed that tissue ACE mRNA was elevated. Immunofluorescence studies also demonstrated an increase of ACE intensity in RAECs exposed to urocortin for 72 h. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor blocker, astressin, abolished the effects of urocortin. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway blocker, PD98059, also markedly inhibited these effects, suggesting urocortin affects the activity of ACE through the ERK1/2 pathway in rats. These findings support the changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) following acute and subchronic injections of urocortin in previous studies. Thus, the changes of the ACE activity and its production of Ang II may play a role in the vasodilatory property of urocortin.",

The likelihood of achieving an exercise systolic BP of >/=210 mm Hg was 68% lower (odds ratio = 0.32, 96% confidence interval 0.2 to 0.53) in the beta-blocker-based therapy versus other medications.

Clinical trials and long-standing perceptions of the typical heart failure patient have related far more to men than to women, while more women than men in the United States may be hospitalized with heart failure. The goal of this study was to analyze ADHERE Registry data, the largest database of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patient hospitalizations available, to gain insight into the effect of gender on medical history, clinical characteristics, and discharge counseling. This preliminary study analyzed the 85,617 ADHF hospitalizations in the ADHERE Registry as of October 2003, with 44,340 (52%) women and 41,276 (48%) men included. Women were significantly older (mean age 74.6 +/- 13.7 years) than men (mean age 70.2 +/- 13.9 years, P < .0001). Women were more likely to have a history of hypertension (75% vs. 69%, P < .0001) and a systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg (56% vs. 44%, P < .0001). History of coronary artery disease was more common in men (64% vs. 51%, P < .0001). Other risk factors for atherosclerosis, including smoking (17% vs. 10%, P < .0001) and hyperlipidemia (37% vs. 32%, P < .0001), were also more common in men. Men had a significantly lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction (32.9%, N = 30,831) than women (42.1%, N = 29,744); 51% of women had preserved left ventricular function (EF > 40%) compared to only 28% of men (P < 0.0001). At discharge, adherence to 3 of the 4 JCAHO standardized measures of quality of care far heart failure patients were documented more frequently for men than for women. A significantly smaller proportion of women received discharge instructions on management of diet, weight, and medications (30.1% vs. 32.8%); received or were scheduled for assessment of left ventricular function (81.5% vs. 85.6%); or were discharged with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor prescription if appropriate (72.6% vs. 73.9%). Real-world data from the ADHERE Registry may lead to better recognition of the signs and symptoms of heart failure in women, increase the proportion of women who are correctly diagnosed, and may help to support gender-specific considerations in heart failure guidelines.",

That role includes reducing the risk of MI recurrence and the progression to heart failure. Equally important is evaluating for the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Although drugs such as beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are typically indicated to help reduce the risk of SCD, data continue to show that using implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) saves lives compared with using medications alone. This article focuses on the problem of SCD, the findings of recent clinical trials, the implant criteria for defibrillators, new Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) decisions regarding reimbursement, and postoperative care for the defibrillator patient. Included are 2 case studies demonstrating the nurses' role in identifying asymptomatic patients who are indicated for ICD therapy.

    "486": "Perindopril is a long-acting, once-daily lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme affinity, lowering angiotensin II and potentiating bradykinin. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of perindopril are well established in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Moreover, large morbidity-mortality trials, such as the EUROPA, PROGRESS, and PREAMI have shown that treatment with perindopril reduces morbidity and mortality and prevents cardiovascular disease in a large range of patients with vascular diseases, whether or not they are hypertensive. Thus, the outcomes of these and other trials support the concept of cardiovascular protective properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with perindopril in addition to the obvious blood-pressure-lowering effect. Considering its properties and the clinical evidence on efficacy and tolerability that has been gathered, perindopril should be considered a first-line therapeutic agent in hypertension, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction and a tool of secondary prevention of coronary artery disease.", 
    "487": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors early after acute myocardial infarction has been demonstrated to be useful for the primary prevention of ventricular remodeling. This treatment has also shown significant and early beneficial effects on mortality, whereas the observed effect in terms of prevention of absolute volume increase was definitely small, and mainly in large infarcts. These results suggest that other effects of ACE-inhibition could contribute to the observed improvement in clinical endpoints. All this has increased the interest in pathophysiologic studies on cardiac remodeling, like the GISSI-3 Echo Substudy, which has shown the complexity and heterogeneity of the phenomenon. In this context comorbidity and mortality are increasing with age, but information on remodeling in the elderly with preserved ventricular function is still lacking. Post-infarction patients > 65 years of age with preserved ventricular function (ejection fraction > 40% by echocardiography) have then been randomized into the Perindopril and Remodelling in the Elderly with Acute Myocardial Infarction (PREAMI) trial. Although mortality and hospitalization for congestive heart failure were not affected significantly by 1-year 8 mg/day of perindopril treatment, a significant beneficial treatment-related effect was observed on left ventricular remodeling. These results suggest the great need for analyzing the heterogeneity of remodeling in the context of different populations with myocardial infarction. This could lead to more individualized and aggressive diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches even in patients at low risk with a small myocardial infarction.", 
    "488": "The trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have followed a particular trend: in the first studies treatment was provided to severely ill patients several time (months or year) after the acute event. Thereafter, in few studies ACE-inhibitors were provided within 2 weeks of the event to patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In other megatrials ACE-inhibitors were started in unselected patients 24 hours after AMI. Thus, the trend is to provide treatment as early as possible to less selected patients. Recently, ACE-inhibitors have been successfully tested not only to treat the consequences of an infarct, but also to prevent its occurrence. EUROPA is the trial that demonstrated that perindopril (8 mg/day) is indicated in all coronary artery disease patients to reduce cardiovascular mortality and occurrence of AMI. The Perindopril and Remodelling in the Elderly with Acute Myocardial Infarction (PREAMI) is another trial recently terminated in elderly post-AMI patients with preserved left ventricular function. Although not associated with better clinical outcomes (most likely because of the rather short treatment period, 1 year), perindopril significantly reduced the combined primary endpoint (death, hospitalization for heart failure and remodeling) and prevented the progressive left ventricular remodeling occurring in elderly patients even in the presence of small infarct size.", 
    "489": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction and in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), especially those with heart failure and/or evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. ACE-inhibitors prevent cardiac events in patients at high cardiovascular risk and/or with documented coronary artery disease. There is a lack of data on the role of ACE-inhibitors in the elderly population with AMI and preserved left ventricular function. Nevertheless, the issue is of primary importance, considering the median age of patients with AMI and heart failure, the high risk of death, heart failure and left ventricular remodeling in the elderly, and the progressive aging of the general population. The multicenter and international (109 centers from five European countries), double-blind, randomized, parallel PREAMI (Perindopril and Remodelling in the Elderly with Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial evaluated the effects of the ACE-inhibitor perindopril in the elderly (aged > or =65 years) with AMI and preserved or mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction > 40%). The combined primary endpoint was death, hospitalization for heart failure, and left ventricular remodeling (considered as an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume > or = 8%). Secondary endpoints included: each single primary endpoint, cardiovascular death, hospitalization for reinfarction or angina, and revascularization. The study involved 1252 patients, with an average age of 73 years, and AMI, treated with recommended usual therapy (antithrombotic drugs, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors). After 11 +/- 4 days from AMI, patients were randomized to receive either perindopril (4 mg/day for the first month and 8 mg/day for the remaining 11 months) or placebo, in addition to the recommended conventional therapy. Clinical assessment was performed at fixed times and included two-dimensional echocardiography (to evaluate left ventricular remodeling), Holter electrocardiographic monitoring (to assess heart rate variability and arrhythmias), and blood sampling (for safety evaluation). This review provides details on the background, rationale and study design of PREAMI.", 
    "490": "This paper reports the rationale for the cardiovascular protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reviews the overall results of recent randomized clinical trials. ACE-inhibitors prevent degradation of bradykinin, exert anti-ischemic action, inhibit thrombosis and platelet aggregation, are antiatherogenic, improve endothelial function and vessel remodeling, and have anti-inflammatory properties. Previous trials have shown that ACE-inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure or ventricular dysfunction. These findings have recently been extended to patients with lower risk profile, no evidence of heart failure and in secondary prevention using lipophilic ACE-inhibitors with high affinity for tissue ACE, i.e. those most likely to have high antiatherosclerotic efficacy. The central role of long-acting lipophilic ACE-inhibitors for cardiovascular protection has been clearly established and they should now be considered as a routine treatment for secondary prevention in the same way as aspirin, beta-blockers and statins.", 
    "491": "Although cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension has been well recognized, the molecular mechanisms for the development of hypertrophy are still largely unknown. In this study, the protein expression profiles of left ventricular myocardia in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at different ages were analyzed using 2-DE in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. The results showed that 20 proteins were modulated in the hypertrophic myocardium. Out of these modulated proteins, 13 proteins presented significant changes in SHR at an early stage prior to the development of sustained hypertension, while the changes of the other 7 protein expressions occurred only at a late stage in SHR when the blood pressure was significantly elevated, and were largely reversible by treatment with rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors losartan or enalapril. These data demonstrate that the changes in energy metabolism in the hypertrophied heart favor an increase in glycolysis and a decrease in oxidation of fatty acid and glucose, which occur at an early stage in SHR without hypertension. Our results also provide evidence to support the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy.",

This change in LA size was not appreciated when measurements were performed using standard M-mode techniques (from 44.3+/-6.9 mm to 44.1+/-7.4 mm; P=not significant). There was no significant relationship between change in LA volume and change in regurgitant fraction or systolic blood pressure. Change in LA volume was moderately correlated with change in left ventricular mass.",

    "497": "Although structural and functional changes of resistance arteries have been proposed to participate in arterial hypertension (HTA) outcome, not all therapies may correct these alterations, even if they normalize the blood pressure (BP). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of the protection afforded by the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan in resistance arteries from patients with essential HTA. In all, 22 untreated hypertensive patients were randomized to receive losartan or amlodipine for 1 year and the morphological characteristics of resistance vessels from subcutaneous biopsies were evaluated. Protein expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and collagens III and IV was detected by immunohistochemistry. In comparison with normotensive subjects, resistance arteries from hypertensive patients showed a significant media:lumen (M/L) ratio increment and a higher protein expression of CTGF, TGF-beta, and collagens. After 1 year of treatment, both losartan and amlodipine similarly controlled BP. However, M/L only decreased in patients under losartan treatment, whereas in the amlodipine-treated group this ratio continued to increase significantly. The administration of losartan prevented significant increments in CTGF, TGF-beta, and collagens in resistance arteries. By contrast, amlodipine-treated patients showed a higher vascular CTGF, TGF-beta, and collagen IV staining than before treatment. Our results show that the administration of losartan, but not amlodipine, to hypertensive patients improves structural abnormalities and prevents the production of CTGF and TGF-beta in small arteries, despite similar BP lowering. These data may explain the molecular mechanisms of the better vascular protection afforded by drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system.",

It also provided dose dependent 17.8% reduction of LV myocardial mass (p<0.05), normalization of initially \"hypertrophic\" type of transmitral flow, 21% lowering of LV end diastolic pressure (p<0.05) without effect on LV volume, geometry, global and local systolic function.",

Angiotensin II activates circulating cells, and participates in their adhesion to the activated endothelium and subsequent transmigration through the synthesis of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines. Among the intracellular signals involved in angiotensin II-induced inflammation, the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB are the best known.",

Aggressive blockade of the renin-angiotensin system appears to have benefits beyond those achieved with conventional doses of single agents. Dual blockade using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers is effective. Aldosterone receptor antagonists may potentiate the effect of these two classes of compounds. It remains unclear, however, whether maximum benefit can be obtained by the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers or aldosterone receptor antagonists as compared to larger doses of single agents. Not enough data are available currently to recommend thiazolidinedione hypoglycemic agents for renal protection. Trials are being conducted with several new classes of agents.",

    "505": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) reduce cardiovascular death in the general population, but data for renal transplant recipients remain elusive. Similarly, ACEI/ARB have been shown to reduce proteinuria, but data on graft survival are lacking. Therefore a retrospective open cohort study was conducted of 2031 patients who received their first renal allograft at the Medical University of Vienna between 1990 and 2003 and survived at least 3 mo. Patient and graft survival was compared between patients with versus without ACEI and/or ARB therapy. Data were analyzed with and without propensity score models for ACEI/ARB therapy. Medication and comorbidities were analyzed as time-dependent variables in the Cox regression analyses. Ten-year survival rates were 74% in the ACEI/ARB group but only 53% in the noACEI/ARB group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio (HR) of ACEI/ARB use for mortality was 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.81) compared with nonuse. Ten-year actual graft survival rate was 59% in ACEI/ARB patients but only 41% in nonusers (P=0.002). The HR of actual graft failure for ACEI/ARB recipients was 0.55 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.70) compared with nonusers; the HR of functional graft survival was 0.56 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.78). Ten-year unadjusted functional graft survival rates were 76% among ACEI/ARB patients and 71% in noACEI/ARB recipients (P=0.57). In summary, the use of ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with longer patient and graft survival after renal transplantation. More frequent use of these medications may reduce the high incidence of death and renal allograft failure in these patients.", 
    "506": "The cardiovascular system is highly organised in time; blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), peripheral resistance, pressure and the release/activity of vasodilating hormones all display pronounced circadian variations. Pathophysiological events within the cardiovascular system are also not random, as shown for instance by sudden cardiac death (SCD), stroke, ventricular arrhythmias (VA), arterial embolism, and symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD) such as myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia, angina attacks (AA) in stable angina (stA) or variant angina (varA) or silent ischemia. In hypertensive patients various anti-hypertensive drugs were investigated in crossover studies (morning vs. evening dosing); however consistent data were only obtained for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Whereas in dippers ACE inhibitors had a super-dipping effect when dosed at night, no consistent difference in BP lowering effect on the 24-hr BP profile was found with calcium channel blockers after morning and evening dosing. In non-dippers the calcium channel blockers isradipine and amlodipine consistently transformed non-dippers into dippers, after evening dosing. Diuretics are also able to normalize a non-dipping behaviour. Moreover, a circadian phase-dependency in pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for various cardiovascular active drugs such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, oral nitrates and ACE inhibitors, modified by the pharmaceutical formulation. There is evidence that in hypertensive dippers anti-hypertensive drugs should be given in the early morning, whereas in non-dippers it may be necessary to add an evening dose or even to use a single evening dose in order to not only reduce high BP but also to normalize a disturbed non-dipping 24 hr BP profile. In CHD, calcium channel blockers-mainly short acting and non-retarded preparations-seem to be less effective than beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in reducing ischemic events during the night and early morning. However, the role of formulation and/or subclasses of the calcium channel blockers remains to be elucidated. In order to get more insight into the circadian regulation of the cardiovascular system animal models of primary and secondary hypertension have been studied in various strains of normotensive and hypertensive rats and mice. At least in rodents there is ample evidence that the 24-hr rhythms in BP and HR are under the control of biological clock(s) as they persist under constant darkness (i.e. in free-run conditions) with a period deviating from 24 hr; these rhythms are abolished by lesioning of the \"master clock\" located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). In conclusion, chronobiological and chronopharmacological studies are important experimental and clinical approaches to get a better insight into the physiological and pathophysiological regulation of the cardiovascular system including their rhythmic organisation. Circadian time-dependent clinical studies also have implications for drug therapy in hypertension and CHD.",

Three days post-infarction, acetylated LDL (acLDL)+/Ulex europeus-1 (UEA-1)+/VEGF receptor-2+/eNOS+ EPC levels and formation of endothelial colony forming units (CFU) were reduced to 60+/-12% (p < 0.05) and 68+/-7% (p < 0.05). In bone marrow, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity were repressed. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was unchanged, whereas reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased two-fold in bone marrow. ACE or HMG-CoA reductase inhibition resulted in significant increases in EPC levels. ACE inhibition increased bone marrow ERK phosphorylation and MMP-9 activity. Statin therapy enhanced bone marrow VEGF protein levels, Akt phosphorylation, eNOS activity and normalized increased ROS levels. Augmented EPC levels in the early post-infarction phase by ACE inhibition or statin treatment were associated with improved cardiac function and increased capillary density in the peri-infarct area 7 days after MI. Moreover, increased EPC levels in response to ACE inhibition or statin treatment were sustained 10 weeks post-infarction.",

This article will discuss advantages of its therapeutic use, the adverse effects that might occur as well as how to overcome this effect and also when it should be stopped. Extensive studies also demonstrate that therapeutic use of ACE-inhibitor will improve the quality of life and survival rate in conjunction with the decrease of morbidity and mortality.", 
    "511": "The main etiology for mortality and a great percentage of morbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus is atherosclerosis. The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes is multifactorial and can be affected by metabolic and other factors. A hypothesis for the initial lesion of atherosclerosis is endothelial dysfunction, defined pragmatically as changes in the concentration of the chemical messengers produced by the endothelial cell and/or by blunting of the nitric oxide-dependent vasodilatory response to acetylcholine or hyperemia. Endothelial dysfunction has been documented in patients with diabetes and in individuals with insulin resistance or at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The way endothelial function altered in diabetic patients is not yet fully understood, but the loss of normal endothelial function could be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy, as endothelial dysfunction is associated with diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. Factors associated with endothelial dysfunction in diabetes include activation of protein kinase C, overexpression of growth factors and/or cytokines, and oxidative stress. Changes in endothelium function may lead to the coronary artery circulation being unable to cope with the increased metabolism of myocardial muscle independently of a reduced coronary artery diameter. Finally, recent reports indicate that an improved metabolic control in diabetic patients, whatever the treatment used, is associated with near normalization or restoration of normal endothelial function.", 
    "512": "These studies aim to investigate subcellular distribution of angiotensin II (ANG II) in rat luteal cells, identify other bioactive angiotensin peptides, and investigate a role for angiotensin peptides in luteal steroidogenesis. Confocal microscopy showed ANG II distributed within the cytoplasm and nuclei of luteal cells. HPLC analysis showed peaks that eluted with the same retention times as ANG-(1-7), ANG II, and ANG III. Their relative concentrations were ANG II >or= ANG-(1-7) > ANG III, and accumulation was modulated by quinapril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Z-proprolinal (ZPP), an inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), and parachloromercurylsulfonic acid (PCMS), an inhibitor of sulfhydryl protease. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine protease inhibitor, did not affect peptide accumulation. Quinapril, ZPP, PCMS, and PMSF, as well as losartan and PD-123319, the angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonists, were used in progesterone production studies. ZPP significantly reduced luteinizing hormone (LH)-dependent progesterone production (P < 0.05). Quinapril plus ZPP had a greater inhibitory effect on LH-stimulated progesterone than either inhibitor alone, but this was not reversed by exogenous ANG II or ANG-(1-7). Both PCMS and PMSF acutely blocked LH-stimulated progesterone, and PCMS blocked LH-sensitive cAMP accumulation. Losartan inhibited progesterone production in permeabilized but not intact luteal cells and was reversed by ANG II. PD-123319 had no significant effect on luteal progesterone production in either intact or permeabilized cells. These data suggest that steroidogenesis may be modulated by angiotensin peptides that act in part through intracellular AT1 receptors.",

Evidence-based cardiovascular protective therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, antiplatelet agents, and lipid-lowering medications, improve outcomes for these patients. However, this population is significantly undertreated with these guideline-recommended agents. Critical pathways have been demonstrated to improve the quality and consistency of treatment; as such, the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) recommend that critical pathways be implemented for the management of these patients. The recent Eplerenone Post-acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrates that eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, has incremental benefit in decreasing mortality and morbidity when used with standard care therapies in patients post AMI with heart failure and LVSD.

    "522": "The binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to ACE initiates a signaling cascade that involves the phosphorylation of the enzyme on Ser1270 as well as activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and leads to alterations in gene expression. To clarify how ACE inhibitors activate this pathway, we determined their effect on the ability of the enzyme to dimerize and the role of ACE dimerization in the initiation of the ACE signaling cascade. In endothelial cells, ACE was detected as a monomer as well as a dimer in native gel electrophoresis and dimerization/oligomerization was confirmed using the split-ubiquitin assay in yeast. ACE inhibitors elicited a rapid, concentration-dependent increase in the dimer/monomer ratio that correlated with that of the ACE inhibitorinduced phosphorylation of ACE. Cell treatment with galactose and glucose to prevent the putative lectin-mediated self-association of ACE or with specific antibodies shielding the N terminus of ACE failed to affect either the basal or the ACE inhibitor-induced dimerization of the enzyme. In ACE-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, ACE inhibitors elicited ACE dimerization and phosphorylation as well as the activation of JNK with similar kinetics to those observed in endothelial cells. However, these effects were prevented by the mutation of the essential Zn2+-complexing histidines in the C-terminal active site of the enzyme. Mutation of the N-terminal active site of ACE was without effect. Together, our data suggest that ACE inhibitors can initiate the ACE signaling pathway by inducing ACE dimerization, most probably via the C-terminal active site of the enzyme.",

Previously we determined the structure of testis ACE (C domain); here we present the crystal structure of the N domain of sACE (both in the presence and absence of the antihypertensive drug lisinopril) in order to aid the understanding of how these two domains differ in specificity and function. In addition, the structure of most of the inter-domain linker allows us to propose relative domain positions for sACE that may contribute to the domain cooperativity. The structure now provides a platform for the design of \"domain-specific\" second-generation ACE inhibitors.",

In the present study, the performance of two commonly used assays based on synthetic N-derivates of tripeptides as substrates were tested with respect to reliability in determination of ACE activity per se and to the inhibitory effect of a tryptic whey protein digest and captopril. In one test, the ACE activity was calculated from the amount of hippuric acid liberated from hippuryl-His-Leu (HHL) during 30 min of incubation with ACE, as quantified after HPLC separation of reaction products. In the other assay, the ACE activity was measured directly as the rate of decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm during the first 30 min of ACE catalysed hydrolysis of furanacroloyl-Phe-Glu-Glu (FA-PGG). Both assays, in the absence of inhibitor, showed a good performance with relative standard deviation between replicate samples around 7%. In the presence of inhibitor solutions, relative standard deviations for both assays varied between 1 and 18% for the variously diluted inhibitors. Both assays gave values for the concentration of inhibitor needed to inhibit ACE by 50% similar to those previously reported for whey protein digests and captopril. Different results from the two assays, however, emphasize the importance of controlling the actual ACE-activity for comparison between assays. The limitations of each assay are discussed. Considering the fewer steps in the assay using FA-PGG as substrate, and thus less time and chemicals consumed per sample, and the simpler equipment needed, this assay is recommended for the screening of clear peptide samples.",

Hydrochlorthiazide was added when therapy was not sufficiently effective. Both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had similar hypotensive activity: blood pressure normalized in 71 and 61% of moexipril and spirapril treated women, respectively. Both drugs promoted normalization of metabolism of lipid (lowering of levels of cholesterol, atherogenic lipoproteins and triglycerides) and carbohydrates (lowering of hyperinsulinemia). Patients with postmenopausal metabolic syndrome had elevation of leptin level up to 27.5+/-5.5 pg/ml. Moexipril and spirapril caused lowering of elevated levels of leptin. These drugs did not affect levels of sex hormones. They exerted vasoprotective (normalization of endothelium dependent and independent vasodilatation) and nephroprotective (attenuation and normalization of microalbuminuria) effects.

Lipid lowering action of simvastatin was realized just in 1 month of treatment and remained sustained for half a year (average duration). 6 months after addition of simvastatin to antihypertensive therapy substantial (58.4%, p=0.044) rise of plasma content of stable nitrogen metabolites took place. At the same time therapy with metoprolol in a similar group of patients exerted no considerable effect on blood plasma concentration of nitrate and nitrite anions. Lowering of median values of TNF-alpha from 20.13 (12.67-52.80) to 11.34 (3.31-31.29) pg/ml (p<0.0038) was also noted at the background of combination antihypertensive therapy.

The results of the study document positive effect of half year treatment of patients with concomitant hypertension and diabetes with simvastatin (10-20 mg/day) in combination with ACEI and verapamil on metabolism of nitric oxide and plasma content of TNF-alpha which realizes independently from degree of hypolipidemic action of simvastatin.", 
    "536": "The incidence and prevalence of heart failure (HF) has increased over the last decades. The main reasons for this increase are the ageing population and an increase in survival rate after myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases. Although, pharmacotherapy has significantly improved survival, the prognosis of HF is still rather poor. Total mortality is high and approximately half of the deaths are sudden and unexpected. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors generally given with diuretic and digoxin are the standard treatment for patients with HF. Despite the established benefits of ACE-inhibitors there is a need for new pharmacological tools for the treatment of HF. Recent experimental evidence has shown that activity of the Na(+)/H(+)-exchanger in the heart (NHE-1) is increased in HF. Because NHE-1 exchanges intracellular H(+) for extracellular Na(+) in a one by one stoichiometry, the intracellular ionic changes resulting from increased activity, will be a increased pH(i) and intracellular sodium ([Na(+)](i)). Activation of NHE-1 results only in a small increase in pH(i), under physiological conditions where bicarbonate-dependent mechanisms are active. However, a considerable increase in [Na(+)](i) was always present. The elevation of [Na(+)](i) might be responsible for the increase of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) levels mediated by the Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX). Increases in [Na(+)](i), pH(i) and [Ca(2+)](i), features of cardiac myocytes isolated from failing hearts, are recognized as a cell growth signal And thus may play a role in the hypertrophic response, cellular remodeling and finally the development of HF. Acute application of cariporide, an inhibitor of NHE-1, on failing myocytes not only normalized [Na(+)](i) but also cytoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling and the propensity to develop delayed after depolarizations (DAD's). In several animal models of HF it has been shown the chronic inhibition of NHE-1 attenuates the development of hypertrophy and whole heart remodeling. Recently, in a volume and pressure overload model of HF in rabbits it has been demonstrated that chronic treatment also prevents the development of HF and cellular ionic and electrophysiological remodeling. Therefore, chronic treatment with an inhibitor of NHE-1 might prove beneficial in patients at risk of developing HF, especially when given at an early stage.", 
    "537": "Animal studies have shown angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to be effective agents for myocardial protection. They protect against lethal arrhythmias, preserve ventricular function, improve coronary reserve (especially after ischemia/reperfusion), and reverse myocardial hypertrophy. Human studies, on the other hand, have shown inconsistent results. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors demonstrated in animal studies provide major advantages for cardiac surgery. First, most cardiac surgery is performed under ischemic arrest induced by a cardioplegic solution, and the protective effects of ACE inhibition against reperfusion injury can reduce peri-operative mortality and morbidity. Second, most patients who undergo such surgery have myocardial hypertrophy due to hypertension, pressure or volume overload mediated by valve disease, or myocardial infarction. Ventricular hypertrophy is a strong risk factor for sudden death, probably from arrhythmia. Regression of the hypertrophy may prevent post-operative sudden death, thereby allowing for long-term benefits of surgery. In this paper, I review ACE inhibitor studies in animals and humans and the protective mechanisms involved. I also discuss why human studies show inconsistent results in spite of the fact that ACE inhibition is consistently protective in animal studies. Finally, I explore the potential clinical applications of ACE inhibitors in cardiac surgery.", 
    "538": "There is a growing body of evidence for the role of inflammation in type 2 diabetes. In addition to the evidence presented elsewhere, evidence is emerging that many drugs that have apparent \"anti-inflammatory\" properties may reduce the incidence and/or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Statins have been found to lower inflammatory markers, and a post hoc analysis of the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) suggested that pravastatin may reduce the risk of developing diabetes, although the Lipid Lowering Arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) found no statistically significant effect of atorvastatin on risk of developing diabetes. Fibrates have been found to lower some markers of inflammation, and a prospective trial found that bezafibrate reduces risk of developing diabetes. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers appear to reduce some markers of inflammation, and a meta-analysis concluded that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Metformin is known to reduce the risk of developing diabetes, and more recent evidence suggests it also lowers C-reactive protein, in part because of its modest weight-reducing effect. Thiazolidinediones reduce risk of developing diabetes, and consistently lower inflammatory markers independent of adiposity effects. High-dose aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase and IkappaB kinase-beta and reduces fasting plasma glucose concentration, although there has not, as yet, been a large-scale trial to examine the effect of aspirin on the risk of developing diabetes. We conclude that although many drugs with potential anti-inflammatory properties reduce the risk of developing diabetes, it is difficult to prove that such anti-inflammatory properties contribute to their diabetes prevention since nearly all drugs have other, often more pronounced, actions. Studies with more specific inhibitors of inflammatory pathways (e.g., interleukin- 6 blockers) and mendelian randomization (genetic studies) will help determine whether targeting the inflammation axis is a fertile mechanism to treat or prevent type 2 diabetes.", 
    "539": "Myocardial fibrosis commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has proven to be an important predictor for cardiovascular events. In experimental settings, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonists have been shown to have anti-fibrotic effects on the myocardium independent of their antihypertensive effects. In this study, to investigate whether the AT1-R antagonist losartan would have such anti-fibrotic effects in patients, we administered losartan or, for purpose of comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme enalapril or Ca2+-antagonist amlodipine to patients with ESRD. Thirty-nine ESRD patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to receive losartan (n=13), enalapril (n=13), or amlodipine (n=13). Ultrasonic integrated backscatter (IBS) and serological markers of collagen type I synthesis and degradation were used to assess the degree of myocardial fibrosis just before and after 6 months of treatment. There were no significant differences in antihypertensive effects among the three agents. In the enalapril- and amlodipine-treated groups, the mean calibrated IBS values increased significantly after 6 months of treatment (enalapril: -31.6 +/- 1.3 to -29.4 +/- 1.2 dB, p=0.011; amlodipine: -30.6 +/- 1.4 to -27.2 +/- 1.2 dB, p=0.012). However, the mean calibrated IBS values in the losartan-treated group did not increase after 6 months of treatment (-31.2 +/- 1.7 to -31.3 +/- 1.4 dB, p=0.88). The ratio of the serum concentration of procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide to the serum concentration of collagen type I pyridinoline cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide was significantly reduced in the losartan-treated group (42.6 +/- 4.6 to 34.4 +/- 3.6, p=0.038). The present study indicates that losartan more effectively suppresses myocardial fibrosis in patients with ESRD than does enalapril or amlodipine despite a comparable antihypertensive effect among the three drugs.",

During ACE-I therapy, circulating levels of angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)] are increased. As cardiac and renal protective effects of Ang (1-7) have been reported, we questioned whether Ang (1-7) contributes to the anti-proteinuric effects of ACE-I treatment. Therefore, we evaluated whether Ang (1-7) infusion reduces proteinuria in a rat model of adriamycin-induced renal disease. In addition, the effect of a selective Ang (1-7) blocker, [D-Ala7]-Ang (1-7) (A779), was investigated in rats treated with the ACE-I, lisinopril (LIS). Six weeks after induction of proteinuria, therapy was started in four different groups: control, Ang (1-7), LIS, and LIS+A779. After two weeks, the rats were sacrificed. Six weeks after injection of adriamycin, the rats had developed proteinuria of 323+/-40 mg/24 hours. The proteinuria remained stable in the control group and in the Ang (1-7) group, but was reduced in both LIS and LIS+A779-treated groups. Similarly, blood pressure (BP) was unchanged in the control and the Ang (1-7) groups, but reduced in both the LIS and the LIS+A779 groups. Plasma levels of Ang (1-7) were increased in the Ang (1-7) and in both LIS-treated groups.

    "549": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in diabetes is thought to contribute to nephropathy. This is suggested by findings of an enhanced renovascular (RPF) response to RAS blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). An alternative approach to assess RAS activation is the evaluation of renin release following RAS blockade. Forty-four consecutively enrolled Type 1 diabetic patients (28.2+/-1.5 years) and 37 normal subjects (37+/-2.6 years) in high salt balance were given 25 mg of captopril and 16 mg of candesartan p.o. on consecutive days. All subjects were Caucasian. All, except one diabetic patient, had normal renal function. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured for four hours after both drugs, and at eight, and 24 hours after candesartan. As anticipated, both drugs increased PRA. Peak responses (90' after captopril) were 5.6+/-1 ng/mL Ang I/hour in diabetic patients, and 1.7+/-0.9 ng/mL Ang I/hour in normal subjects (p<0.001). Responses to both drugs were correlated in diabetic patients for PRA (r=0.623; p=0.001) and for RPF (r=0.9; p<0.001). When the PRA response to captopril was below the median, the RPF response was limited (22.1+/-17.6 ml/minute/1.73 m2). When it was above the median, the RPF response was also larger (62.2+/-13.9 ml/minute/1.73 m2; p=0.006). Renin response to ACE-I and ARB confirms activation of the RAS in diabetic patients.",

The first part of the current review was published in the last issue of this journal and discussed the important role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in diabetic nephropathy and the genetic influence on development of endstage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetic patients. This second part of the review focus on the potential improvement of the current treatment strategy to slow down the loss of kidney function using dual blockade of the RAS with both ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Substantial evidence from short-term studies using surrogate endpoints indicates a beneficial impact of dual blockade of the RAS, not obtainable with single agent blockade alone, both in diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. This conclusion has been confirmed and extended in a longterm trial with regard to prevention of ESRD in non-diabetic renal disease. Results indicate that dual blockade of the RAS may further slow down, but not arrest progressive loss of renal function. However, studies defining the optimal dose of ACE-I / ARBs without additional adverse effects are essential to ensure relevant comparison with dual blockade therapy. Trials using primary renal endpoints in diabetic nephropathy are still needed, and will finally establish the role of dual blockade of the RAS in a clinical setting.",

Most of this literature focuses on improving the availability and efficacy of reperfusion therapy. The purpose of this article is to review contemporary scientific evidence and guideline recommendations regarding the diagnosis and therapy of STEMI. Studies and epidemiological data were identified using Medline, the Cochrane Database, and an Internet search engine. Medline was searched for landmark and recent publications using the following key words: STEMI, guidelines, epidemiology, reperfusion, fibrinolytics, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), facilitated PCI, transfer, delay, clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), beta-blockers, nitrates, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The data accessed indicate that urgent reperfusion with either fibrinolytics or percutaneous intervention should be considered for every patient having symptoms of myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation or a bundle branch block. The utility of combined mechanical and pharmacological reperfusion is currently under investigation. Ancillary treatments may utilize clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, or low molecular weight heparin, depending on the primary reperfusion strategy used. Comprehensive clinical practice guidelines incorporate much of the available contemporary evidence, and are important resources for the evidence-based management of STEMI.", 
    "552": "Hyponatremia as it occurs in the heart failure patient is a multifactorial process. The presence of hyponatremia in the heart failure patient correlates with both the severity of the disease and its ultimate outcome. The therapeutic approach to the treatment of hyponatremia in heart failure has traditionally relied on attempts to improve cardiac function while at the same time limiting fluid intake. In more select circumstances, hypertonic saline, loop diuretics, and/or lithium or demeclocycline have been used. The latter two compounds act by retarding the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin but carry with their use the risk of serious renal and/or cardiovascular side effects. Alternatively, agents that selectively block the type 2 vasopressin receptor increase free water excretion without any of the adverse consequences of other therapies. Conivaptan, lixivaptan, and tolvaptan are three such aquaretic drugs. Vasopressin receptor antagonists will redefine the treatment of heart failure-related hyponatremia and may possibly evolve as adjunct therapies to loop diuretics in diuretic-resistant patients.",

The clinical significance of this 1%-3.5% difference, however, has not been established. Different studies report different outcomes. In large outcome trials the occurrence of NOD did not effect mortality or morbidity outcomes. Although one study reported that NOD had the same prognosis as pretreatment diabetes, another did not. At present, data are insufficient to suggest that NOD is of important clinical significance or that present treatment recommendations, especially regarding the use of diuretics, should be changed.", 
    "554": "Hypertension is commonly associated and acts synergistically with diabetes in increasing the risk of macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications. Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that this risk is significantly reduced by intensive antihypertensive treatment, and accordingly, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guideline has further lowered the blood pressure goals for diabetic subjects to <130/80 mm Hg. This implies that most diabetic patients will require the combination of two or more antihypertensive agents to achieve this blood pressure target. Although the most effective combination strategy in diabetes has not yet been determined in large-scale randomized clinical trials, a combination that includes at least one agent that interrupts the renin-angiotensin system appears to not only have a good safety profile, but may also provide additional renal and cardiovascular protection. Other antihypertensive agents should be added based on the patients risk profile and overall treatment regimen to achieve blood pressure goal.", 
    "555": "Much debate surrounds the question of the optimal therapeutic choices for medication to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular events. Experimental evidence suggests that drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system retard vascular disease through their direct ability to antagonize the effects of angiotensin II, which has vasoconstrictive, vascular proliferative, and atherosclerotic effects. It is not known how to separate the potential vascular protective effects of the drugs from their antihypertensive benefits. Clinical trial evidence indicates that achieved lower blood pressure goals almost always confer cardiovascular risk reduction advantages. There is also evidence, however, that successful antihypertensive regimens incorporating a renin-angiotensin system blocker, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, provide more cardiovascular risk reduction benefit compared with regimens that do not incorporate a renin-angiotensin blocker. This includes composite or specific end points involving reduction of stroke, myocardial infarction, or development of end-stage renal disease.",

This study tested the hypothesis that androgens enhance responsiveness to ANG II during the development of hypertension in New Zealand genetically hypertensive (NZGH) rats. Male NZGH rats were obtained at 5 wk of age and subjected to sham operation (Sham) or castration (Cas) then studied at three age groups: 6-7, 11-12, and 16-17 wk. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal blood flow (RBF) measurements were recorded under Inactin anesthesia. These variables were measured after enalapril (1 mg/kg) treatment and during intravenous ANG II infusion (20, 40, and 80 ng/kg/min). Plasma testosterone was measured by ELISA. Angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor expression was assessed by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. ANG II-induced MAP responses were significantly attenuated in Cas NZGH rats. At the highest ANG II dose, MAP increased by 40+/-4% in Sham vs. 22+/-1% in Cas NZGH rats of 16-17 wk of age. Similarly, renal vascular resistance (RVR) responses to ANG II were reduced by castration (209+/-20% in Sham vs. 168+/-10% in Cas NZGH rats at 16-17 wk of age). Castration also reduced MAP recorded in conscious NZGH rats of this age group. Testosterone replacement restored baseline MAP and the pressor and RVR responses to ANG II. Castration reduced testosterone concentrations markedly. Testosterone treatment restored these concentrations. Neither castration nor castration+testosterone treatment affected AT1 receptor mRNA or protein expression. Collectively, these data suggest that androgens modulate renal and systemic vascular responsiveness to ANG II, which may contribute to androgen-induced facilitation of NZGH rat hypertension.", 
    "557": "One-quarter of adult population in different world regions are reported to live with hypertension, of whom, a high percentage had a diabetes mellitus (DM). This co-morbid state is believed to act synergistically on accelerating the long-term diabetic complications. Therefore, adequate treatment of high blood pressure is essential for diabetic patients, and should be always directed to their benefits. Albumin glycation is still the most important explanation for the pathogenesis of chronic diabetic complications. Our in vitro experiments induce non-enzymatic glycation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) under physiological conditions. The levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were measured by their characteristic intrinsic fluorescence. Additions of captopril at concentrations from 5 to 50 microM caused 10-47% reduction in the formation of AGEs. Captopril binding properties of native and glycosylated BSA were characterized, and its affinity towards the native albumin was unaltered by the in vitro glycation. Therefore, we concluded that captopril could protect against albumin glycation, and it has a similar binding affinities towards native and glcosylated protein. Anti-glycation effect may help to attenuate the serious long-term diabetes related complications. Besides, the unchanged pharmacokinetic parameters provide an essential extra beneficial effect for diabetic hypertensive patients.",

A tablet containing 5 mg GTN was bucally administered for 5 minutes to 17 healthy volunteers. Blood pressure (BP) was recorded, and serum ACE activity, ACE genotype, and plasma cGMP was analyzed. GTN administration significantly reduced BP only in individuals with the deletion/deletion (DD) genotype. Sixty minutes after GTN administration, serum ACE activity was reduced in individuals with the insertion/insertion (II) and insertion/deletion (ID) genotypes, but not the DD genotype. Comparing the change in ACE activity over time between the genotypes resulted in the following: II vs. DD, p < 0.01; II vs. ID, p < 0.05; and ID vs. DD, p < 0.05.

Three groups of animals were analyzed: sham-operated rats (n = 6), MI rats receiving lisinopril (n = 11), and MI rats receiving placebo (n = 8). LV dilation occurred on day 3 in both MI groups. LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were significantly lower in lisinopril-treated rats than in placebo-treated rats at days 15 and 30. EF was lower in both MI groups than in the sham group at all time points, and did not differ between the MI groups during follow-up. Less LV hypertrophy was observed in rats receiving lisinopril than in rats receiving placebo at days 15 and 30. We found acceptable within- and between-observer agreement and an excellent correlation between MRI and ex vivo LV mass (r = 0.96; p < 0.001). We demonstrated the ability of MRI to detect the early beneficial impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on LV remodeling. Accurate and noninvasive, MRI is the tool of choice to document response to treatment targeting postinfarction LV remodeling in rats.", 
    "573": "Drugs may cause urticaria by different mechanisms. The most well-known mechanism is the allergic reaction mediated by immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies, which induce acute generalized urticaria. Allergic reactions to beta-lactams are the most common cause of adverse drug reaction mediated by IgE antibodies. However, IgE antibodies are not always necessary to activate the release of mediators from mast cells and induce acute urticarias. Some drugs, such as opiates or codeine, act directly on mast cells, and others, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, induce an exacerbation of chronic urticaria by a pharmacological mechanism involving the arachidonic acid metabolism. Additionally, angioedema is a wellknown complication of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors by its action on bradykinin, which is a potent vasodilatator agent. Topical drugs, such as antibiotics, disinfectants, or anesthetics, may cause urticaria, which sometimes progresses to generalized urticaria and, more rarely, to anaphylactoid reactions.",

To evaluate the role of damping in the common carotid artery (CCA) wall in human hypertension and the possible improvement of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, we used noninvasive CCA pressure (tonometry) and diameter (B-mode echography) waveforms in normotensive subjects (NT group; n=12) and in hypertensive patients (HT group; n=22) single-blind randomized into HT-placebo (n=10) or HT-treated (ramipril, 5 to 10 mg/d during 3 months; n=12). Vascular smooth muscle (VSM) null tonus condition was achieved from in vitro pressure and diameter waveforms (Konigsberg microtransducer and sonomicrometry) measured in explanted human CCA (n=14). Arterial wall dynamics was described by viscous (eta), inertial (M), and compliance (C) parameters, mean circumferential wall stress, viscous energy dissipation (WD), peak strain energy (WSt), damping ratio (xi=WD/WSt), and modeling isobaric indexes CIso and WSt(Iso). The lack of VSM tonus isobarically increased wall stress and reduced eta, CIso, and damping (P<0.01). Wall stress, eta, and WD were greater in HT than in NT (P<0.015) and arrived near normal in HT-treated (P<0.032 respect to HT), with no changes in HT-placebo. Whereas CIso increased in HT-treated (P<0.01) approaching the NT level, xi did not vary among groups. During hypertension, because of the WSt increase, the arterial wall reacts increasing WD to maintain xi. ACE inhibition modulates VSM activation and vessel wall remodeling, significantly improving wall energetics and wall stress. This protective vascular action reduces extra load to the heart and maintains enhanced arterial wall damping.",

At hospital admission, a total of 863 potential DDIs were detected in 272 patients (68.0%; 95% CI 63.4, 72.6). At discharge, 1171 potential DDIs were detected in 355 patients (88.8%; 95% CI 85.7, 91.8).

    "625": "These results show that the availability of a number of effective antihypertensive drugs is not sufficient to secure an adequate control of blood pressure. The timely combination of antihypertensive drugs in reduced dose (alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and calcium antagonists) in combination with high doses of agents blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could improve the efficacy while reducing side effects.", 
    "626": "The incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is rising worldwide, accompanied by corresponding increases in the risk of morbidity and mortality. Underlying this trend are increasing rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the two most common causes of ESRD. In addition to the adverse haemodynamic effects of hypertension on the kidney, elevated blood pressure (BP) can activate components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which, in turn, activate mediators of inflammation, oxidative stress, cell growth, and matrix accumulation. Lowering BP reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and renal damage. Accumulating evidence from clinical and laboratory studies suggests that interrupting the RAAS with therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor blockers can interfere with the mechanisms that promote diabetic and non-diabetic renal damage. Moreover, clinical trials of RAAS blockade have demonstrated reductions in microalbuminuria, a predictor of increased cardiorenal risk and overt nephropathy in patients with and without diabetes and/or hypertension. In this way, agents that block the RAAS should be considered the drugs of first choice as they provide enhanced renoprotection compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers.", 
    "627": "Data from prospective studies suggest a significant reduction in the risk of new diabetes from drug therapies containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Since the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been found locally in several tissues and cells, including pancreatic islets, we hypothesized that the positive metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors may be due to a beneficial action of these compounds on insulin-secreting beta-cells.", 
    "628": "Isolated human pancreatic islets were studied after 24 h of incubation with 22.2 mmol/l glucose, with or without the presence in the incubation medium of 0.5-6.0 mmol/l zofenoprilat or enalaprilat, ACE inhibitor drugs which differ by the presence of a sulphydryl or a carboxyl group in their structural formula. Functional and molecular studies were then performed to assess insulin secretion, redox balance, mRNA and protein expression.", 
    "629": "Angiotensinogen, ACE and angiotensin type 1 receptor mRNA expression increased in islets cultured in high glucose; this was similarly prevented by the presence of either ACE inhibitor. As expected, preculture of human islets in high glucose determined a marked reduction in insulin secretion which was associated with enhanced oxidative stress, as shown by increased nitrotyrosine concentrations, and enhanced expression of protein kinase C beta and NADPH oxidase. The presence of either of the ACE inhibitors counteracted several of the deleterious effects of high glucose exposure, including reduction of insulin secretion and increased oxidative stress; zofenoprilat showed significantly more marked effects.", 
    "630": "These results showed that: (a) RAS molecules are present in human islets and their expression is sensitive to glucose concentration, (b) ACE inhibitors, and in particular zofenoprilat, protect human islets from glucotoxicity and (c) the effects of ACE inhibition are associated with decreased oxidative stress. Together, these findings provide evidence that the possible beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in human diabetes are due, at least in part, to a protective action on pancreatic beta-cells.", 
    "631": "Most drugs are designed primarily for oral administration, but the activity and stability profiles desirable for this route often make them unsuitable for transdermal delivery. We were therefore interested in designing analogues of captopril, a model drug with poor percutaneous penetration, for which the sustained steady-state blood plasma level associated with transdermal delivery (and which is unattainable orally) would be particularly beneficial. Quantitative structure-permeability relationships (QSPRs) predicted that ester and thiol prodrug derivatives of captopril would have lower maximal transdermal flux (J(m)) than the parent drug, since the increases in permeability coefficient (k(p)) of prodrugs would be outweighed by the reductions in aqueous solubility. Therefore, the aim of this study was to synthesize a series of prodrugs of captopril and to determine if a QSPR model could be used to design therapeutically viable prodrugs. Molecules with the highest predicted k(p) values were synthesized and characterized, and J(m) measured in Franz diffusion cells from saturated aqueous donor across porcine skin (fresh and frozen). In-vitro metabolism was also measured. Captopril and the prodrugs crossed the skin relatively freely, with J(m) being highest for ethyl to butyl esters. Substantial first-order metabolism of the prodrugs was observed, suggesting that their enhanced percutaneous absorption was complemented by their metabolic performance. The results suggested that QSPR models provided excellent enhancements in drug delivery. This was not seen at higher lipophilicities, suggesting that issues of solubility need to be considered in conjunction with any such use of a QSPR model.",

On hospital arrival, 250 mg of hydrocortisone and 5 mg of dexchlorpheniramine were given intravenously (i.v.) and 0.3 mg of epinephrine was given subcutaneously (s.c.). The edema of the tongue progressed over the next 8 h and made the tongue protrude. Fiberscopy revealed glassy edema of the arytenoids. Inspiratory stridor was heard and the patient could not speak. She became increasingly uneasy and restless. Berinert complement 1 (C1) inhibitor concentrate (1500 units) was administered i.v. Over the following 20 min, stridor gradually subsided, the patient calmed and she was able to talk.", 
    "634": "ACE inhibitor-provoked angioedema shares many clinical features with hereditary angioedema (HAE), including a limited effect of steroids, antihistamines and epinephrine. HAE, caused by excess bradykinin formation as a result of C1 inhibitor deficiency, usually has its laryngeal edema effectively reversed by C1 inhibitor in less than 0.5 h. Although patients experiencing ACE inhibitor-provoked angioedema have normal C1 inhibitor values, as in our patient, excess bradykinin is probably important as ACE breaks down bradykinin. It is unknown why ACE inhibitor-provoked angioedema appears in some and sometimes after many years of use.",

This agent has shown pharmacodynamic effects beyond those responsible for lowering blood pressure (BP), including the improvement of endothelial function and the normalisation of vascular and cardiac structure and function. Perindopril has a well established role in the treatment of patients with hypertension or heart failure. In the EUROPA trial, once-daily perindopril 8 mg prevented cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) without any apparent heart failure receiving standard recommended therapy. In the ASCOT-BPLA trial, a calcium channel antagonist +/- perindopril regimen demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits compared with a conventional beta-blocker +/- diuretic regimen in patients with hypertension who were at risk of developing cardiovascular events. These trials demonstrate that while perindopril, in addition to standard recommended therapy, has a potential role in preventing cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients, its role in the management of patients with stable CAD is clearly established.", 
    "637": "Patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) are at increased risk for dying suddenly of cardiac causes. The most common causes of LVD are coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Aggressive intervention following MI is essential for minimizing the myocardial damage that leads to LVD and the subsequent risk for heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This article describes practical algorithms for managing the patient post MI to minimize such risks. The degree of LVD is a key factor for determining clinical management strategies in the patient post MI. Risk factor reduction and selective neurohormonal blockade, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are usually recommended in the presence or absence of LVD, along with early use of a beta blocker. In patients with LVD, more aggressive intervention includes extended use of a beta blocker. In cases of LVD progressed to heart failure, the mixed beta and alpha blocker carvedilol has improved outcomes significantly. In clinical trials, carvedilol has been demonstrated to have antiarrhythmic activity, a property that offers protection against sudden arrhythmic death in high-risk patients with LVD. Addition of an aldosterone antagonist is also advised in patients with heart failure. In selected patients with reduced ejection fractions, use of surgical/catheter treatment and device therapy offers further benefits.", 
    "638": "The pharmacologic management of the patient post myocardial infarction (MI) aims to achieve several goals. Chief among these is to prevent subsequent events, which include death, reinfarction, and rehospitalization. Secondary goals include preventing arrhythmias, minimizing left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and preventing progression to heart failure. This review describes practical algorithms for use in the pharmacologic management of the patient post MI based on American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. The intensity of drug treatment is determined guided by the degree of LV dysfunction and the presence or absence of ischemia and arrhythmic risk markers. All patients post MI require an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antiplatelet therapy, usually with aspirin. In individuals who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is an adequate substitute. Numerous studies document the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, which decrease mortality and the risk of heart failure and stroke. Aldosterone blockade is recommended long-term for patients post MI with an LV ejection fraction < or = 40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes. Use of a beta blocker is an important addition to most post-MI drug regimens. Beta blockers decrease mortality and are especially effective in patients with impaired LV function. Among the beta blockers, carvedilol, which also has alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity, was found to decrease mortality significantly in patients with low ejection fractions and heart failure. Another drug therapy of value in post-MI treatment is use of calcium-channel blockers. These are restricted to patients with conserved LV function in whom congestion is absent and in whom beta blockers are contraindicated. Current guidelines also recommend that patients post MI with elevated cholesterol levels should be prescribed lipid therapy with a statin at hospital discharge.", 
    "639": "Current guidelines define the standard of care for patients after myocardial infarction (MI), with particular focus on patients with significant ventricular dysfunction. Inherent in these recommendations are assumptions about the relative risks and benefits, as well as the costs, of the available options. This review will consider strategies to prevent sudden death and heart failure post-MI by utilization of pharmacologic therapies--angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), aldosterone antagonists, statins, and beta-blockers--in parallel with the approaches reviewed elsewhere in this supplement. A patient-centric approach necessitates that drugs in each class be compared for efficacy within this patient population. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, in patients post-MI, yet these benefits do not seem to be reflected in the epidemiologic data. This may reflect underutilization of these therapies or, alternatively, support the notion that efficacy in clinical trials does not assure effectiveness in clinical practice. The latter point is a subject of ongoing investigation, while the former is being addressed through quality-of-care initiatives. In clinical practice, aggressiveness is key, starting with patient education. If patients understand their risks better, compliance and adoption of a more ideal lifestyle seem more likely. However, even with educational programs, human nature teaches us that marked change in behavior is difficult and therefore, to minimize risks, particularly of sudden death and heart failure post infarction, an optimized pharmacologic regimen serves as a powerful tool.", 
    "640": "According to the Canadian Heart Health Survey, only 14% of Canadian hypertensive patients are aware of their disease and are treated appropriately. One of the reasons for this could be that physicians are confused by an excess of confusing and contradictory information regarding the choice of drugs. Two recent publications may contribute to a much-needed simplification of the problem. The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration published a meta-analysis based on 29 randomized trials that comprised a total of more that 162,000 participants. The treatment regimens were based on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. The main finding of the meta-analysis was that treatment with any of the blood pressure-lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events, and the extent of these risk reductions was directly related to the degree of blood pressure lowering. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) compared valsartan with amlodipine. At the end of the study, the reductions in blood pressure from baseline were 17.3/9.9 mmHg in the amlodipine group and 15.2/8.2 mmHg in the valsartan group (P<0.0001). There was a significantly lower incidence of myocardial infarction in the amlodipine group (4.1%) than in the valsartan group (4.8%). From these two studies, it would be reasonable to conclude that the treatment of elevated blood pressure has two main goals: to achieve a normal blood pressure and to produce a happy patient. The agent or agents used to obtain these goals are relatively unimportant.",

Management of blood pressure in patients during acute ischaemic stroke, however, is complicated by the need to maintain brain perfusion. Lowering blood pressure in the acute setting may avoid the deleterious effects of high blood pressure but may also lead to cerebral hypoperfusion and worsening of the ischaemic stroke. Little information is available from clinical trials concerning optimal blood pressure management in acute stroke. Current protocols of thrombolytic therapy require strict blood pressure control below certain prescribed limits; however, in most acute stroke patients not treated with thrombolysis, blood pressure reduction is not routinely recommended and guidelines for target blood pressures are difficult to justify.

This study was performed to elucidate the peptide's action mechanisms of inhibiting ACE. Intravenous administration of synthetic P4 peptide resulted in significant drops in the blood pressures of SHRs. As Dixon plots indicate, the P4 peptide showed high affinity toward ACE (K(i) = 11.48 microM) and only 10% of the total amount of the P4 peptide was decomposed. The analyses of the relationship between the ACE inhibitory activity and structure of the P4 peptide clarified that Hyp-Gly-Leu-Hyp-Gly-Phe showed a stronger activity (IC50 = 10 microM) than the P4 peptide (IC50 = 46 microM). When Phe at the C-terminus of the P4 peptide was deleted, IC50 changed to 25000 microM, indicating that Phe at the C-terminus of the peptide is very important for ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "661": "A database consisting of 168 dipeptides and 140 tripeptides was constructed from published literature to study the quantitative structure--activity relationships of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. Two models were computed using partial least squares regression based on the three z-scores of 20 coded amino acids and further validated by cross-validation and permutation tests. The two-component model could explain 73.2% of the Y-variance (inhibitor concentration that reduced enzyme activity by 50%, IC50) with the predictive ability of 71.1% for dipeptides, while the single-component model could explain 47.1% of the Y-variance with the predictive ability of 43.3% for tripeptides. Amino acid residues with bulky side chains as well as hydrophobic side chains were preferred for dipeptides. For tripeptides, the most favorable residues for the carboxyl terminus were aromatic amino acids, while positively charged amino acids were preferred for the middle position, and hydrophobic amino acids were preferred for the amino terminus. According to the models, the IC50 values of seven new peptides with matchable primary sequences within pea protein, bovine milk protein, and soybean were predicted. The predicted peptides were synthesized, and their IC50 values were validated through laboratory determination of inhibition of ACE activity.", 
    "662": "Food-derived bioactive peptides with ACE-inhibitory properties are receiving special attention due to their beneficial effects in the treatment of hypertension. In this work we evaluate the impact of a simulated gastrointestinal digestion on the stability and activity of two bioactive peptides that derive from ovalbumin by enzymatic hydrolysis, YAEERYPIL and RADHPFL. These peptides possess in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity and antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The results showed that YAEERYPIL and RADHPFL were susceptible to proteolytic degradation after incubation with pepsin and a pancreatic extract. In addition, their ACE-inhibitory activity in vitro decreased after the simulated digestion. The antihypertensive activity on SHR of the end products of the gastrointestinal hydrolysis, YAEER, YPI, and RADHP, was evaluated. The fragments YPI and RADHP significantly decreased blood pressure, 2 h after administration, at doses of 2 mg/kg, but they probably did not exert their antihypertensive effect through an ACE-inhibitory mechanism. It is likely that RADHP is also the active end product of the gastrointestinal digestion of the antihypertensive peptides FRADHPFL (ovokinin) and RADHPF (ovokinin 2-7).", 
    "663": "The radioprotective effects of captopril were investigated by using the micronucleus test for anticlastogenic and cell proliferation activity. A single intraperitoneal administration of captopril at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg 1 h prior to gamma irradiation (2 Gy) reduced the frequencies of micronuleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MnPCEs). All three doses of captopril significantly reduced the frequencies of MnPCEs and increased polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE)/PCE+NCE (normochromatic erythrocyte) ratio in mice bone marrow compared to the non-drug-treated irradiated control (p < 0.001). The optimum dose for protection in mouse was 10 mg/kg to protect mice bone marrow 2.18-fold against the clastogenic effects of gamma-irradiation with respect to the non-drug-treated irradiated control. There was a drug dose-response effect of captopril in increasing the PCE/PCE+NCE ratio in bone marrow cells. The maximum protective effect of captopril was at a dose of 25 mg/kg for increasing the PCE/PCE + NCE ratio. Captopril exhibited concentration-dependent antioxidant activity, scavenging > 96% of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free radicals when used at a concentration of 0.2 mM. In this study captopril reduced lipid peroxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide in mice liver. It appears that captopril, due to its free radical scavenging properties, protects mice bone marrow cells from radiation-induced DNA damage and genotoxicity.", 
    "664": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system was previously thought to be restricted to the cardiovascular system. It now appears that this system also has important functions in other tissues. Hematopoiesis can be affected by inhibitors of the renin system in patients and in various experimental models. The renin system, particularly angiotensin II, has a role in different stages of hematopoiesis, notably during the first wave in the chick embryo (primitive hematopoiesis) and in the human adult (definitive hematopoiesis). In addition, the renin-angiotensin system in mice is involved in reconstitutive hematopoiesis following experimental irradiation; inhibition of this system improved the hematopoietic recovery in this situation. The clinical relevance and therapeutic applications of these findings offer a new area of clinical research. In this article, we review the evidence for a role for the renin system in the control of hematopoiesis at its different stages.", 
    "665": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Ang II-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been suggested to be involved in several diabetic complications. We investigated whether the inhibition of Ang II production with an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) reduces oxidative stress and limits structural cardiovascular remodeling in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Diabetic rats were treated for 7 weeks with an ACEi (lisinopril, 5 mg/kg/d), an antioxidant (N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), 0.5 g/kg/d) and their combination. At sacrifice, ROS in the myocardium and thoracic aorta, LV myocyte number and size and aorta morphology were determined by quantitative histological methods. Superoxide and hydroxyl radical content, detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), were 6.7 and 4.5-fold, respectively, higher in diabetic myocardium than in non-diabetic controls (p<0.001). The amount of superoxide was 5-fold higher in the thoracic aorta of diabetic rats compared to controls (p<0.001). Diabetes caused a modest increase in myocyte volume (+13%, p<0.01), a reduction of LV myocyte number (-43%, p<0.001), an accumulation of collagen around coronary arterioles (1.9-fold increase, p<0.01) and a decrease in arterial elastin/collagen ratio (-63%, p<0.001) compared to controls. Treatment with the ACEi attenuated ROS formation and prevented phenotypic changes in the heart (cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, perivascular fibrosis) and in the aorta of diabetic rats to the same extent as NAC. The absence of an additive effect, suggests a common mechanism of action, through the reduction of oxidative stress.", 
    "666": "Recurrent angio-oedema is a sign of various acquired and inherited disease entities, including hereditary angio-oedema types I and II that result from a genetic deficiency of C1 inhibitor, and a recently described type of dominantly inherited angio-oedema, which does not show a deficiency of C1 inhibitor. Until now, this new type of hereditary angio-oedema, designated as hereditary angio-oedema type III, has been assumed to be a disorder specific to females. We now describe a four-generation family with dominantly inherited angio-oedema and normal C1 inhibitor in which, in contrast to all previous observations, not only five female but also three male family members were clinically affected. One male patient was mainly affected following the intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Our current observation leads to new considerations about the classification of hereditary angio-oedema with normal C1 inhibitor. Either hereditary angio-oedema with normal C1 inhibitor can be an entity affecting females predominantly, but not exclusively; in that case, men appear to have a much reduced chance of clinical manifestations. Alternatively, our present observation of hereditary angio-oedema with normal C1 inhibitor affecting both sexes may represent a new disease entity, presumably with a different underlying defect.",

Between January 2001 and January 2005, 122 consecutive patients (26.2% female, mean age 66 +/- 11 years) with chronic heart failure were enrolled in the study. Etiology was: coronary heart disease 40.2%, dilated cardiomyopathy 18%, hypertension 18%, unknown 14%, valvular heart disease 4.9%, other 4.9%. Cardiologists were expected to assess etiology, to perform instrumental examinations and titration of beta-blockers; nurses to reinforce patient education to monitor adherence to pharmacological and dietary therapy. Patients were subsequently followed by primary physicians. The endpoints were to compare: 1) hospitalization and emergency department admissions in the 12 months before the first evaluation and every year after referral; 2) Minnesota questionnaire, NYHA functional class, pharmacological therapies at the referral time and at the end of follow-up.",

    "671": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease since they improve blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and prolong survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. Most of the information about the therapeutic role of ACE-inhibitors has been achieved during the last 20 years since the publication of some pivotal trials mostly involving the use of ACE-inhibitors like captopril and enalapril. In particular the treatment with enalapril has considerably improved the clinical outcome of patients with either mild-to-moderate (SOLVD studies) or severe (CONSENSUS trial) congestive heart failure. The benefit of ACE-inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure has also involved a remarkable reduction in the rate of hospitalization, thus contributing to improve the pharmaco-economic approach to the disease. Most of the beneficial effect of ACE-inhibitors in clinical practice is dependent on their capacity of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, although some recent trials have supported a primary role for such drugs (in particular enalapril) in the prevention of atrial fibrillation. After more than 25 years from their discovery, ACE-inhibitors must be again considered among the first-line treatment in many patients with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "672": "Elevated plasma concentrations of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are found in various clinical settings, including renal failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and pre-eclampsia. In healthy people acute infusion of ADMA promotes vascular dysfunction, and in mice chronic infusion of ADMA promotes progression of atherosclerosis. Thus, ADMA may not only be a marker but also an active player in cardiovascular disease, which makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions. This review provides a summary and critical discussion of the presently available data concerning the effects on plasma ADMA levels of cardiovascular drugs, hypoglycemic agents, hormone replacement therapy, antioxidants, and vitamin supplementation. We assess the evidence that the beneficial effects of drug therapies on vascular function can be attributed to modification of ADMA levels. To develop more specific ADMA-lowering therapies, mechanisms leading to elevation of plasma ADMA concentrations in cardiovascular disease need to be better understood. ADMA is formed endogenously by degradation of proteins containing arginine residues that have been methylated by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (PRMTs). There are two major routes of elimination: renal excretion and enzymatic degradation by the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH-1 and -2). Oxidative stress causing upregulation of PRMT expression and/or attenuation of DDAH activity has been suggested as a mechanism and possible drug target in clinical conditions associated with elevation of ADMA. As impairment of DDAH activity or capacity is associated with substantial increases in plasma ADMA concentrations, DDAH is likely to emerge as a prime target for specific therapeutic interventions.", 
    "673": "Reference data on the function of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and pharmacological correction of its hyperactivity are summarized and analyzed in the paper. RAAS plays important role in the development and worsening of hypertension, facilitates proliferation of smooth muscle and heart cells. The hyperactivity of RAAS promotes the development of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, increases cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Pharmacological correction of RAAS hyperactivity decreases hypertension, prevents occlusion of heart and blood vessels, provides anti-ischemic action, vascular and cardiac protection, improves life style, prevents cardiovascular mortality, such as fatal stroke, myocardial infarction and sudden death. b-blocker inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin AT1-receptors blockers are reviewed as first line therapy of essential hypertension and congestive heart failure. ACT inhibitors, AT1- receptor blockers decrease total cholesterol, LDL, but increase HDL, beta-blockers decrease HDL. AT1-blockers are alternative drugs for treatment of cardiovascular diseases in those cases where ACE inhibitors are contraindicated or intolerance exists.", 
    "674": "The main active factor in the progression of chronic heart failure (CHF) is a renin-angiotensin system (RAS), namely its main hormone angiotensin-II, which induces variety effects of given neurohormonal system (vasoconstriction, increased arterial pressure, hypertrophy, and fibrosis). It diminishes the role of the etiological factor and determines the quality to life and prognosis of the disease. Prestarium as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor significantly improved the functional class (FC) and increased the 6 min distance of walking. In addition, patients reported a slight improvement of life quality. Prestarium consistently improved all major parameters of central hemodynamics, with a statistically significant improvement of end systolic volume and LV ejection fraction by 3 months. Therefore Prestarium improved the clinical status and exerted beneficial effects on LV volumes and LV contractile capability in patients with CHF.", 
    "675": "ACE inhibition and/or blocking of the angiotensin II receptor are recognized as first-line treatment for nephropathy and cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients. However, little information is available about the potential benefits of these drugs on diabetic neuropathy. We examined vascular and neural activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats that were treated for 12 weeks with enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, or L-158809, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. A prevention protocol (group 1) as well as three intervention protocols (treatment was initiated after 4, 8, or 12 weeks of diabetes [groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively]) were used. Endoneurial blood flow and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) were impaired in all groups of untreated diabetic rats. In group 1, treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril or L-158809 partially prevented the diabetes-induced decrease in endoneurial blood flow and MNCV. In groups 2-4, intervention with enalapril was more effective in reversing the diabetes-induced impairment in endoneurial blood flow and MNCV than L-158809. The superoxide level in the aorta and epineurial arterioles of diabetic rats was increased. Treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril or L-158809 reduced the superoxide level in the aorta in all groups but was less effective in epineurial arterioles. Acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) cause vasodilation in epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve, which was impaired by diabetes. Treatment of diabetic rats (all groups) with enalapril or L-158809 completely prevented/reversed the diabetes-induced impairment in CGRP-mediated vascular relaxation. Treatment with enalapril or L-158809 was also effective in improving impaired acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation, but the efficacy was diminished from groups 1 to 4. These studies suggest that ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers may be effective treatments for diabetes and vascular and neural dysfunction. However, the efficacy of these treatments may be dependent on when the treatment is initiated.", 
    "676": "Mitral regurgitation after myocardial infarction is the result of multifactorial processes involving local and global left ventricular remodeling. The prevalence of mitral regurgitation varies from 11% to 59%. Published studies differ greatly in design, inclusion criteria, duration of follow-up, and technique of mitral regurgitation assessment. However, they consistently indicate that mitral regurgitation after myocardial infarction carries an adverse prognosis with increased risk of death and heart failure independently of previously known indicators of risk after myocardial infarction. Mitral regurgitation is often clinically silent; therefore, it should be systematically evaluated by echocardiography. Standard color Doppler imaging is a highly sensitive method to detect even mild degrees of ischemic mitral regurgitation. One unique advantage of echocardiography is that it accurately quantifies the severity of mitral regurgitation by measuring the effective regurgitant orifice area and the regurgitant volume using Doppler methodology. Therefore, the evaluation should include precise quantification of the degree of mitral regurgitation to best appraise the ensuing risk. Current medical options rely chiefly on angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors and beta-blocker therapy, and surgical approaches offer future promise. Both categories of therapeutic approaches should be evaluated by randomized controlled trials.",

Apud Tedlie (MCW) in anesthetized rats of Sprague-Dawley strain, through an invasive direct blood pressure measuring procedure. Thirty adult rats, weighing 150-230 g, were grouped into five groups of six rats each. The effects of the intravenous graded doses (0.0005-0.05 mg/kg) of the extract on the blood pressure indices were investigated. Its underlying mechanisms were also studied using additional five groups of rats. The results showed that the extract caused a dose dependent fall in the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure and heart rate of the rats. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCO) caused a reflex increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate which were significantly attenuated by the extract injection. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) blockade with 5 mg/kg of Captopril and cholinergic blockade with 0.2 mg/kg of atropine significantly attenuated the hypotensive response to MCW. However, the pattern of MAP fall in rats pretreated with a combination of Promethazine (1 mg/kg) and Cimetidine (15 mg/kg) was not significant. The results of the study was able to demonstrate dose dependent hypotensive effect of MCW and that its vasorelaxant effects may be through inhibition of sympathetic, cholinergic control of the arterial pressure and most significantly through ACE blockade.

This retrospective study sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of electrical storm in patients with ICDs. One hundred sixty-two patients (126 men; mean age 58 +/- 13 years) who received ICDs from January 2001 to January 2005 were included in the study. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and ICD stored data and electrograms were collected and analyzed. Twenty-two patients (14%) developed electrical storm during a mean follow-up of 14.3 +/- 10 months. Using Cox multiple regression analysis, it was found that an ejection fraction <25% (p = 0.007), QRS width > or =120 ms (p = 0.002), and a lack of adjunctive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy (both p < 0.001) were correlated with a greater probability of electrical storm. Adjunctive amiodarone and digoxin therapy, indication of ICD implantation, and age were not correlated with the occurrence of electrical storm during follow-up (all p = NS). In conclusion, electrical storm is not uncommon in patients with ICDs. Optimum medical therapy with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could reduce the occurrence of electrical storm, and this especially should be considered in those at greater risk for this complication (i.e., those with left ventricular ejection fractions <25% and QRS widths > or =120 ms).", 
    "699": "We studied the effects of chronic (4 weeks) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril on arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) variability, as well as on cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), in aged (20 months) rats. Series of basal RR interval (RRi) and systolic AP (SAP) were studied by autoregressive spectral analysis with oscillations quantified in low (LF: 0.2-0.8 Hz) and high frequency (HF: 0.8-2.5 Hz). BRS was measured by linear regression between HR and MAP changes. Captopril did not affect the spectra of RRi or SAP in young rats. Aged rats presented a reduction in variance (time domain) and in LF and HF oscillations of RRi and SAP. Captopril induced, in aged rats, a decrease in absolute and normalized LF oscillations and in LF/HF ratio of RRi. Captopril also reduced the variance, without changing its LF or HF components of SAP. Reflex tachycardia was reduced in aged as compared to young rats (-1.1+/-0.2 versus -3.4+/-0.5 bpm/mm Hg) and captopril did not affect it. Reflex bradycardia was also reduced in aged rats (-0.7+/-0.5 versus -2.0+/-0.4 bpm/mm Hg), but captopril prevented this attenuation in aged rats (-2.3+/-0.3 versus -0.7+/-0.5 bpm/mm Hg). These data indicate that there is a reduction in HR and SAP variability during aging, suggesting impairment of cardiovascular autonomic control. Captopril was able to change the power of oscillatory components of RRi, suggesting a shift in cardiac sympatho/vagal balance toward parasympathetic predominance. In addition, blockage of ACE improved the reflex bradycardia, but not the reflex tachycardia in aged rats.",

We describe a patient who, during enalapril treatment, developed cough, upper airway symptoms, and diurnal sleepiness, with an increased number of obstructive apnea-hypopnea episodes (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], 25) during sleep. Her symptoms and AHI improved 1 month after enalapril was discontinued and diuretic therapy (hydrochlorothiazide-spironolactone) was initiated. Similar findings were observed in 4 other patients with OSA who had ACE inhibitor-induced cough. The mean +/- SD AHI was 33.8+/-21.0 during enalapril treatment and 20.0+/-17.0 after withdrawal of this drug (P = .04). Exhaled nitric oxide, a marker of airway inflammation, was increased during enalapril treatment (15.0 +/- 4.3 parts per billion) and decreased after discontinuation of this drug (9.0 +/- 2.6; P = .03). No significant difference in the AHI and exhaled nitric oxide was observed in 4 patients with OSA who did not experience cough, before or after withdrawal of ACE inhibitor treatment.

In this study, we investigated contribution of plasma matrix metalloproteinases to development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive subjects. Hypertensive patients with (n = 27) and without LVH (n = 23) were included. All participants underwent a complete transthoracic echocardiographic examination, including recordings of the mitral annular early, late, systolic and diastolic velocities by Doppler imaging. Plasma concentrations of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were determined by the one-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay method. Plasma MMP-3 and MMP-9 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with LVH than those without LVH (2.4 +/- 1.2 vs 1.5 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, p = 0.006 and 5.2 +/- 2.8 vs 3.3 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, p = 0.003, respectively). MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels were also correlated with left ventricular posterior wall thickness and Doppler indices of diastolic dysfunction. Our findings have suggested that increased MMP levels may contribute to LVH and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, treatment of hypertension with MMP lowering drugs, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, may have favorable effects on LVH and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.",

In this review, response to two treatment schemes in different patients with HUS and proteinuria with or without hypertension or renal failure is commented. Early indication of poor sodium diet and strict control of protein intake at the very moment of hospital discharge is strongly recommended, as well as angiotensin II conversion inhibiting enzymes (iACE) at the appearance of proteinuria.", 
    "703": "To test the hypothesis that NO contributes to effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on fibrinolysis, fibrinolytic balance was assessed in 17 normal subjects during placebo and after randomized, double-blind 4-week treatment with the NO precursor L-arginine (3 g TID), ramipril (10 mg QD), or L-arginine+ramipril. Neither L-arginine nor ramipril alone affected basal plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen in these salt-replete subjects in whom plasma renin activity was suppressed (mean+/-SD 0.7+/-0.5 ng angiotensin I/mL per hour). In contrast, L-arginine+ramipril reduced morning plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (10.8+/-9.5 ng/mL) and the molar ratio of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1:t-PA (2.3+/-1.6) compared with placebo (13.5+/-10.8 ng/mL, P=0.006; ratio 2.9+/-2.1, P=0.015) or ramipril alone (15.2+/-13.2 ng/mL, P=0.009; ratio 3.7+/-3.3, P=0.005). L-arginine and ramipril synergistically increased d-dimers (23.1+/-31.5, 29.7+/-50.0, 35.1+/-50.0, and 57.1+/-144.8 ng/mL during placebo, L-arginine, ramipril, and L-arginine+ramipril, respectively; P<0.05 for L-arginine+ramipril versus any other group). During ramipril, the NO synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitro-arginine-methyl-ester (2 mg/kg) significantly increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-antigen after 2 hours (from 9.4+/-8.6 ng/mL during vehicle to 13.5+/-11.0 ng/mL during L-NG-nitro-arginine-methyl-ester; P=0.020), consistent with an effect on expression but rapidly increased t-PA activity (from 0.4+/-0.3 to 0.5+/-0.4 IU/mL; P=0.031), consistent with an effect on release. Both effects of L-NG-nitro-arginine-methyl-ester were reversed by L-arginine. During angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, endogenous NO decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen and improves fibrinolytic balance in normotensive salt-replete subjects.", 
    "704": "Systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disease whose therapy is focused at pathogenic pathways causing variable types of damage in the individual organs. There are 3 major pathways that cause organ damage in scleroderma. First, t-cells, cytokines and inflammation are prominent very early in the disease. Early alveolitis which occurs before interestial fibrosis in the lungs is the best example of inflammation. Second, endothelial cell damage causes severe thickening of vessels and two of the most deadly complications in scleroderma, pulmonary arterial hypertension and renal crisis. Scleroderma renal crisis is now very treatable with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. There are now treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension which should improve outcome in these patients as well. Third, fibroblasts lead to severe cutaneous fibrosis or skin thickening that is the hallmark of the disease. No treatment is available but we are hopeful that new antagonists to the cytokine, TGF beta, will prove helpful. B cells and autoantibodies are not involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, but there are scleroderma specific antibodies that help in defining patient subsets. All of these factors are influenced by unknown inciting agents and the permissive genetic background.", 
    "705": "Beta-blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are standard therapies after myocardial infarction (MI) in the general population. Their use and association with mortality in elderly dialysis patients after MI have not been studied sufficiently.", 
    "706": "Claims records from Medicare and Medicaid patients aged 65 years and older who participated in prescription benefit plans of 2 eastern states were used to identify dialysis patients with MI between 1995 and 2003. Study outcomes were outpatient use of beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs within 90 days after MI. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess predictors of such use. Multivariate Cox regression was applied to test for associations between beta-blocker, statin, and ACE-inhibitor and/or ARB use and 1-year mortality.", 
    "707": "We identified 902 dialysis patients who were hospitalized with MI. Of these, 39.5% died within 90 days and 63.6% died within 1 year after MI. Of 494 patients who were discharged within 21 days or less and survived longer than 90 days, 31.0% were administered an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB; 19.4%, a statin; and 34.2%, a beta-blocker after discharge. Use of ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs was associated with a 30% reduction in 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.98), whereas statin (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.45) and beta-blocker use (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.43) were not.", 
    "708": "Elderly dialysis patients have excessively high mortality and low use of standard therapies after MI. Only ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs were associated with a reduced risk for death at 1 year in this population. Whether the high mortality rate in this population is attributable to such low use of preventive cardiovascular medications remains uncertain.", 
    "709": "The major therapeutic approach to systemic and pulmonary hypertension and vasospasm in cardiac surgery patients involves the use of parenteral agents that reverse systemic vasoconstriction and produce vasodilation. Potential pharmacologic approaches include 1) alpha1-adrenergic receptor blockers, ganglionic blockers, and calcium channel blockers; 2) central alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonists, dopamine1-adrenergic receptor agonists, potassium channel modulators, and vascular cyclic nucleotide stimulators; 3) phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitors, and 4) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Of the currently available intravenous vasoactive therapies, the mainstay agents are the nitrovasodilators and the dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers. The nitrovasodilators, a diverse group of drugs that achieve vascular relaxation by stimulating cyclic nucleotides and thereby releasing nitric oxide, include nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside. Although these drugs are useful, rapid development of tolerance is a drawback to nitroglycerin, while nitroprusside can cause coronary steal and increase intracranial pressure. Intravenous dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers inhibit mechanical responses of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle by blocking inward calcium currents. Nicardipine is an arterial specific vasodilator. Treatment for vasospasm is usually empiric; pharmacologic options include nitroglycerin, but dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and phosphodiesterase inhibitors should also be considered.", 
    "710": "A micro-reactor system with continual spectrophotometric detection has been operated in Sequential Injection lab-on-valve (SI-LOV) mode and applied to enzyme kinetics and inhibition studies, using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) as model systems. With the advantages of automation, real-time kinetic measurement, and thorough mixing, the SI-LOV micro-reactor system allows for the monitoring of initial reaction rates and determination of reactant concentrations in the reaction mixture, both of which are essential for the determination of kinetic constants for enzymes and inhibitors. Enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor are precisely metered by the syringe pump and delivered to a stirred micro-reactor, followed by a reference scan that establishes the baseline for the following reaction rate measurement. Michaelis constants (Km) for AChE and ACE were determined to be 0.16 mM and 0.30 mM, respectively, which are consistent with literature values. The type of inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive, or mixed), the dissociation constants for the inhibitors, and the inhibitor dose-response curves were also determined.", 
    "711": "The aims of investigations were to assess the prevalence of arterial hypertension (AH) among Latvian population aged > or = 45 years and to evaluate the current AH management situation in Latvia. Four epidemiological databases (Dbases) for analyses were selected: Dbases of a randomized urban population of Riga city (in 1997) and Kuldiga region (in 2000), a Dbase of the DIASCREEN population selected by high risk to diabetes from those visiting family doctors (in 2003) and a Dbase of a Latvian population selected from those visiting family doctors during 3 days in 2005. The prevalence of AH in the urban population was 41.8 +/- 1.4% (with 61.2% for persons over age 45), in rural population 40.5 +/- 1.6% (with 63.7% for those aged above 45). Therapeutic control of AH for patients over 45 years with regular medicine intake differed significantly in three samples of the population analysed: Riga 7.2 +/- 2.7%, Kuldiga 9.9 +/- 1.6% and DIASCREEN 6.4 +/- 0.8%. The addition of another risk factor decreases the control rate, especially in a combination of AH and overweight. The most widely prescribed drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) 31%, diuretics 21% and beta-blockers 20% of patients. AH control rate in the case of monotherapy with ACEI was 6.9 +/- 0.9%, calcium antagonists 5.6+1.2%, beta-blockers 12.5+2.0% and diuretics 3.8+1.4%. The current status of management of hypertension in Latvia is discussed.", 
    "712": "The American Diabetes Association recommends routine screening for albuminuria to detect early nephropathy in all patients with diabetes mellitus. If nephropathy is identified, treatment with an antiangiotensin agent decreases progression and improves renal outcomes. Concordance with guidelines for nephropathy screening and antiangiotensin therapy among diabetic patients in a primary care setting of an academic community medical center was evaluated. Medical charts of adult patients with diabetes mellitus from February 2000 through January 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. In part 1 of the study, whether patients were screened for nephropathy at least once was recorded. In part 2 of the study, antiangiotensin prescribing was assessed in all patients and in subgroups stratified by screening. In both parts of the study, patient characteristics and comorbidities were assessed using multivariate analysis to determine their impact on the odds that a patient was screened and that antiangiotensin therapy was prescribed. Among the 329 patients included, 182 patients (55.3%) were screened for nephropathy. Patients who were screened were younger (OR=0.83 for 10-year increase, 95% CI: 0.69-0.99), less likely to have congestive heart failure (OR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.20-0.90), and more likely to be cared for by a resident physician directly supervised by an attending physician (OR=3.03; 95% CI: 1.82-5.03). A total of 215 patients (65.3%) were prescribed antiangiotensin therapy. Hypertension was a predictor of antiangiotensin therapy among all patients who were screened (OR=10.34, 95% CI: 4.45-24.01), those who were screened and negative (OR=15.46, 95% CI: 5.56-42.98), and those who were not screened (OR=10.79, 95% CI: 4.39-26.52). Among patients screened for nephropathy, coronary artery disease (OR=3.01, 95% CI: 1.05-8.63), and the presence of proteinuria (OR=4.26, 95% CI: 1.61-11.24) were predictors of antiangiotensin use. This study found that the likelihood of screening for nephropathy among diabetic patients was inversely associated with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure and increasing age. Conversely, care by a resident physician directly supervised by an attending physician increased the odds that patients would be screened. A diagnosis of hypertension and the presence of albuminuria were each associated with increased use of an antiangiotensin agent.",

    "715": "Patients receiving PD are more likely to develop a cough than other patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving hemodialysis. Although both groups of patients frequently receive medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, that can trigger cough and both may be at increased risk for fluid overload and pulmonary edema, the increased risk associated with PD appears to relate to gastroesophageal reflux, likely from the peritoneal dialysate.", 
    "716": "A dry, persistent cough is a well-described class effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medications. The mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough remains unresolved, but likely involves the protussive mediators bradykinin and substance P, agents that are degraded by ACE and therefore accumulate in the upper respiratory tract or lung when the enzyme is inhibited, and prostaglandins, the production of which may be stimulated by bradykinin.", 
    "717": "Data for this review were obtained from a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search, which was performed in May 2004, of the literature published in the English language from 1985 to 2004, using the search terms \"angiotensin-converting enzyme,\" \"angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,\" and \"cough.\"", 
    "718": "The incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough has been reported to be in the range of 5 to 35% among patients treated with these agents. However, a much lower incidence has been described in studies of patients presenting for the evaluation of chronic cough. The onset of ACE inhibitor-induced cough ranges from within hours of the first dose to months after the initiation of therapy. Resolution typically occurs within 1 to 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy, but cough may linger for up to 3 months. The only uniformly effective treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced cough is the cessation of treatment with the offending agent. The incidence of cough associated with therapy with angiotensin-receptor blockers appears to be similar to that of the control drug. In a minority of patients, cough will not recur after the reintroduction of ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "719": "In a patient with chronic cough, ACE inhibitors should be considered as wholly or partially causative, regardless of the temporal relation between the initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy and the onset of cough. Although the cessation of therapy is the only uniformly effective treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced cough, some pharmacologic agents have been shown to attenuate the cough.", 
    "720": "Like the introduction of digitalis more than 200 years ago, novel medical therapies today have the potential to significantly alter the course of heart failure (HF) and save thousands of lives. This review outlines new directions in HF medical management beyond the foundation of neurohormonal blockade. Furthermore, the role of novel risk factors in HF such as chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, and sleep apnea present tantalizing therapeutic targets to extend the morbidity and mortality benefits of current therapies. The course of time will tell which of these risk factors and therapies can hold promise, given the recent litany of negative trials in the HF arena. Advancements in molecular and genetic techniques have allowed us to begin to consider patient specific therapies and lay the groundwork for even further improvements in treatment of symptomatic HF. Finally, advances in telemedicine and device technology will allow the clinician to remotely monitor useful clinical parameters such as heart rate variability and pulmonary filling pressures to make more informed clinical decision-making and improve outcomes.", 
    "721": "HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME POST-PARTUM: We describe a case of a 37-year-old woman admitted for severe renal failure to our hospital immediately after the delivery by caesarean section of twins. She had anuria, anemia, and moderate thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of hemolytic-uremic syndrome was made. Plasma exchange was started, substitution was performed with fresh frozen plasma and eight consecutive plasmapheresis sessions were given. She received hydrocortisone and ACE inhibitors. After about fifteen days from the beginning of the illness, signs of active haemolysis disappeared and renal function was partially recovered. A genetic study demonstrated the absence of HF1 and MCP mutations but a polymorphic variant of the HF1 gene (C-257T promoter region). This polymorphism is strongly associated with non-diarrhoea-HUS (D-HUS). Post-partum HUS is quite a rare syndrome and has a poor outcome; however prompt diagnosis and efficacious therapy could save lives without clinical consequences. The excellent outcome of this patient seems to corroborate this concept.", 
    "722": "The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers both control hypertension by interruption of the production or action of angiotensin II, the major end-product of the renin-angiotensin system. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in pregnant women revealed serious and deleterious effects on fetal development including renal failure, renal dysplasia, hypotension, oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and hypocalvaria. The fetal effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors seem to be greatest during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. The fetal effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors during the 1st trimester is controversial. These effects may represent the effect of hypoperfusion in the fetus and not a teratogenic effect. The effect of angiotensin receptor blockers is similar to converting enzyme inhibitors. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in all pregnant women. Alternative antihypertensive medications should be considered for use in women of childbearing years.",

The third group (C) was pretreated for 7days with oral administration of zofenopril (6.5 mg/day). The hearts had a baseline perfusion for 30 minutes with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 degrees C, cardioplegia administration for 3 minutes, then 30 minutes of ischemia without any perfusion, and finally 30 minutes of reperfusion with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 degrees C.",

    "728": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) reduces proteinuria and the rate of renal function deterioration in diabetic nephropathy and other glomerular diseases, but its role in quiescent lupus nephritis has not been established. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the effects of ACEI/ARB on proteinuria and renal function in patients with persistent proteinuria (>1 g/day) despite resolution of acute lupus nephritis following immunosuppressive treatment. Fourteen out of 92 patients were included. The duration of treatment with ACEI/ARB was 52.1 +/- 35.7 months. The levels of proteinuria, serum albumin, serum creatinine, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 1.10 to 6.90 g/day, 35.8 +/- 3.6 g/L, 102.54 +/- 34.48 micromol/L, 137.6 +/- 10.9 and 81.9 +/- 9.2 mmHg at baseline. Proteinuria and serum albumin showed significant sustained improvements after 6 and 24 months of treatment. Comparison of slopes for serial proteinuria, albumin and reciprocal of serum creatinine before and after treatment showed significant improvements in six (43%), eight (57%) and two patients, respectively. At last follow-up proteinuria remained significantly lower (0.36 g/day, P = 0.043) and albumin higher (41.3 +/- 2.2 g/L, P = 0.023). Eleven (78.6%) patients had proteinuria improved by >50%, and five had insignificant proteinuria at last follow-up. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced from 6 months onwards, but this did not correlate with proteinuria reduction. Diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, anti-dsDNA, C3 and haemoglobin were not altered. We conclude that ACEI/ARB effectively reduces proteinuria and improves serum albumin in patients with persistent proteinuria despite quiescent lupus nephritis.", 
    "729": "To examine the role of sulfhydryl (-SH) group in improvement of endothelial dysfunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in experimental high dose of methionine dieted rats. We compared the effects of Captopril (an ACE inhibitor with -SH group), enalapril (an ACE-inhibitor without -SH group), N-acetylcysteine (only -SH group not ACE inhibitor) on endothelial dysfunction injured by methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into seven groups: control group, L-methionine group, low dose Captopril (15 mg/kg), middle dose Captopril (30 mg/kg), high dose Captopril (45 mg/kg), enalapril (20 mg/kg), N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg); control group were intragastric gavaged by water and others groups were intragastric gavaged by L-methionine and drugs in water one time every day. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR), sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced endothelium-independent relaxation of aortic rings were examined. Paraoxonase1 (PON1) and ACE activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum were analyzed. It was found that a single intragastric gavage by L-methionine resulted in inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation, markedly increased the serum level of malondialdehyde and decreased the activity of PON1 and SOD, similarly decreased the level of NO in the serum; but had no effects on endothelium-independent relaxation and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity compared with the control group. Given the treatment with three doses of Captopril (15 approximately 45 mg/kg) markedly attenuated inhibition of vasodilator responses to ACh, and eliminated the increased level of malondialdehyde, the decreased level of NO, activity of PON1 and SOD in serum by single intragastric gavaged L-methionine. However, there were some significant differences among Captopril (30 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg), enalapril (20 mg/kg), and N-acetylcysteine particular in the activity of PON1 and ACE. These results suggested that Captopril can protect the vascular endothelium against the damages induced by L-methionine in rats, and the beneficial effects of Captopril may be related to attenuating the decrease in PON1 activity and NO levels. Furthermore, this protective effect may be concerned with the sulfhydryl group.", 
    "730": "Underlying causes, risk factors, and precipitating causes of heart failure (HF) should be treated. Patients with HF and an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (systolic HF) or normal left ventricular ejection fraction (diastolic HF) should be treated with diuretics if fluid retention is present, with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker if the patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor because of cough, angioneurotic edema, rash, or altered taste sensation, and with a beta blocker unless contraindicated. If severe systolic HF persists, an aldosterone antagonist should be added. If HF persists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be added. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided if systolic HF is present. Digoxin should be avoided in men and women with diastolic HF if sinus rhythm is present and in women with systolic HF. Digoxin should be given to men with systolic HF if symptoms persist, but the serum digoxin level should be maintained between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/ml. Cardiac synchronized pacing should be considered in patients with severe systolic HF despite optimal medical therapy, with sinus rhythm, and with ventricular dyssynchrony.", 
    "731": "Impaired perfusion of the corpora cavernosa is considered an important causal factor of erectile dysfunction (ED) in the aging male with atherosclerosis. Aim. On the basis of this notion, we hypothesized that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) may have a structural beneficial effect on cavernosal perfusion and subsequently on erectile function in men with impaired cavernosal perfusion.", 
    "732": "A total of 59 men with atherosclerotic ED (mean age, 60.0 +/- 6.8 years) and impaired cavernosal perfusion, as demonstrated with penile-pharmaco duplex ultrasonography, were randomized between an ACE inhibitor and placebo treatment arm. The minimum period of intervention was 26 weeks (26-46 weeks). The goal of the study was to demonstrate an improvement of (i) cavernosal arterial perfusion demonstrated by a decrease of blood flow velocity waveform; and (ii) erectile function in the erection domain of the International Index of Erectile Function.", 
    "733": "Cavernosal perfusion improved significantly (paired samples t-test, P < 0.05) in both study arms, but the improvement did not differ significantly (anova, P > 0.05) between both arms. The number of sexually active men increased, and the severity of ED decreased in both groups.", 
    "734": "Although a persisting improvement of cavernosal perfusion by at least a 6 month-administration of an ACE inhibitor in men with advanced atherosclerotic ED could not be demonstrated in this pilot study, the beneficial effect on cavernosal perfusion, sexual activity, and erectile function in all participants of this study is remarkable. This pilot study warrants a follow-up study in sexually more active men with ED and less advanced atherosclerosis to show that ACE inhibition may result in persisting improvement of cavernosal perfusion.", 
    "735": "The tetra-peptide Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP) generated by the cleavage of thymosine beta4 inhibits the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and the proliferation and secretion of fibroblasts in the myocardium and the glomeruli. The clinical administration of Ac-SDKP has been proposed and partially investigated. The peptide could protect hematopoietic stem cells during anti-neoplastic treatments leaving cancerous cells unprotected. As it opposes the effects of TGFbeta it could prevent fibrosis after myocardial infarcts and glomeruli fibrosis during the natural course of diabetic nephropathy. However, until now the expected benefits of such a treatment are based on an indirect consideration. Indeed, the degradation of Ac-SDKP is due to the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Interestingly, the blocking of this enzyme both improves the above-mentioned fibrosis and increases the plasma levels of Ac-SDKP. Should the therapeutic effects prove solid, and therapeutic levels be established assaying Ac-SDKP could be an interesting marker of therapeutic efficiency.", 
    "736": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) have a renoprotective effect in patients with chronic renal failure. Prostaglandins (PGs) have also been shown to ameliorate renal impairment. Although these two have different mechanisms-ACE-I reduces intraglomerular pressure by dilating the efferent arterioles, while it is thought that PGs may increase intraglomerular pressure--coadministration of these drugs may have an additive effect. Administration of a PG with an ACE-I might have an additive effect on chronic renal failure. However, there have been no studies on the efficacy of such a combination therapy. This study was conducted to determine whether combination therapy with PGE1 and an ACE-I might have a long-term benefit on chronic renal failure. Sixty patients with chronic renal disease receiving an ACE-I in advance were assigned to receive an ACE-I alone or an ACE-I plus PGE1. Blood pressure, blood chemistry, urinary protein excretion, and the changes in the reciprocal of serum creatinine (delta1/Cr) were monitored once monthly for an average of 36.5 months. In patients treated only with an ACE-I, the progression of renal failure did not change with time. In contrast, the decline of renal function was significantly reduced with the combination therapy. The renoprotective effect of the combination therapy was not exerted by reduced proteinuria or by decreased blood pressure. PGE1 may reinforce the renoprotective effects of ACE-I to prevent the progression of chronic renal failure.", 
    "737": "Imidapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that is widely used in treating hypertension, although the responses vary among individuals. We investigated whether a single nucleotide polymorphism at position -816 of the carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) gene, which activates imidapril in the liver, is involved in the responsiveness to imidapril medication. A total of 105 Japanese hypertensives with systolic/diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP) of 140/90 mmHg or higher were prescribed 5-10 mg/day of imidapril. At baseline, blood pressure levels were not different between patients with and those without the -816C allele (AA vs. AC+ CC groups). After 8 weeks of treatment, we classified the responders and non-responders based on the decline in their blood pressures, and found that the responder rate was significantly higher in the AC+CC group than in the AA group (p=0.0331). Also, the reduction in SBP was significantly greater in the AC+CC group than in the AA group (24.7+/-11.8 vs. 17.6+/-16.8 mmHg, p=0.0184). Furthermore, an in vitro reporter assay revealed that the -816C construct had significantly higher promoter activity (p<0.0001). These findings suggest that the A(-816)C polymorphism affects the transcriptional activity, and that this may account for the responsiveness to imidapril.", 
    "738": "The consumption of fermented milk to maintain good health, including the maintance of normal blood pressure, is an ancient tradition in a number of areas of the world (e.g., East Asia, France). Recent studies have suggested that fermented milk has a normotensive effect in hypertensive rats and humans, but no effect on blood pressure in normotensive rats and humans. Two tripeptides, L-valyl-L-prolyl-L-proline (VPP) and L-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-proline (IPP), have been identified as possessing significant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity and are therefore believed to be the source of the normotensive effects. This document, the second of nine chapters, provides information on these two tripeptides, including physical/chemical properties, molecular weights, chemical structures, normal consumption in the diet, manufacturing information, regulatory approval in Japan, and Japanese consumption of food containing enhanced levels of VPP plus IPP. In addition, the results of studies in rats and humans conducted to evaluate the effect of these substances on blood pressure are presented. The research suggests that in adult normotensive volunteers, consumption of up to 7.92 mg of VPP and 4.52 mg IPP daily for 2 weeks causes neither clinical signs nor biologically meaningful effects on systolic or diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, or clinical pathology (serum chemistry or hematology). However, when a similar study was performed using mildly and moderately hypertensive adults as subjects and they consumed 2.52 mg of VPP and 1.64 mg of IPP per day, a significant drop in systolic blood pressure was detected for a prolonged time interval. This chapter also introduces the issue of safety testing for these substances and describes the information to be found in the subsequent seven chapters.", 
    "739": "Connective tissue diseases represent a group of heterogeneous disorders that share certain common features, including inflammation of the skin, joints and other structures rich in connective tissue, as well as altered immunoregulation patterns, including autoantibody production and cell-mediated immunity abnormalities. While certain distinct clinical entities can be defined, manifestations can vary considerably from patient to patient, and the overlap of clinical features between and among specific diseases is common. Genetic, environmental and sex hormonal factors are likely to be of pathogenic importance. Among these diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus is the most frequent, followed by systemic sclerosis or scleroderma (SSc), Sjogren's disease, polymyositis and dermatomyositis and mixed connective tissue disease. Systemic sclerosis involves multiple organs in a process consisting of disseminated sclerosis affecting all compartments. Prominent vascular lesions typify the renal lesions. Scleroderma crisis is a major complication of SSc, characterized by severe hypertension, rapidly progressive renal failure, thrombotic microangiopathy with hemolitic anemia and low platelet count: the prompt use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors significantly increased the 1-yr survival rate from 15 to 76%. Sjogren's syndrome is an immunologic disorder characterized by progressive lymphocytic destruction of the exocrine gland, frequently resulting in symptomatic eye and mouth dryness. The interstitial lesions constitute the principal renal manifestations: interstitial infiltrates and small lymphocytes, which can be homogenous and massive. In polymyositis and dermatomyositis renal involvement is rare.", 
    "740": "Sufficient evidence and consensus exist to recommend propranolol, timolol, amitriptyline, divalproex, sodium valproate, and topiramate as first-line agents for migraine prevention. There is fair evidence of effectiveness with gabapentin and naproxen sodium. Botulinum toxin also has demonstrated fair effectiveness, but further studies are needed to define its role in migraine prevention. Limited evidence is available to support the use of candesartan, lisinopril, atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, fluoxetine, magnesium, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), coenzyme Q10, and hormone therapy in migraine prevention. Data and expert opinion are mixed regarding some agents, such as verapamil and feverfew; these can be considered in migraine prevention when other medications cannot be used. Evidence supports the use of timed-release dihydroergotamine mesylate, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects.", 
    "741": "Relative to species tested in laboratory studies, the human fetus displays higher vulnerability to enalapril and other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) exhibiting a malformative syndrome that does not appear to have a similar counterpart in experimental animals. An important reason for this higher vulnerability is the earlier intrauterine development of the kidney and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) system in humans, organ systems that are specific targets of ACEI's pharmacological effect. In humans, these systems begin developing prior to the onset of skeletal ossification at the end of the first trimester, with continuing vulnerability throughout the pregnancy. In most animal species tested, these target systems develop close to term, when the fetus is relatively more mature and less vulnerable to the effects of developmental toxicants. For this reason, animal studies that follow standard protocols and evaluate developmental toxicity only for exposures during embryogenesis will miss developmental effects arising secondary to disruption of target systems that develop after the period of major organogenesis. Thus, although the animal mode of action (MOA) for enalapril and other ACEI is plausible in humans, differences in the timing of development of critical target organ systems, particularly the renal system and RAS, explain the absence of definitive structural abnormalities in test animals.", 
    "742": "Hypertension is a major vascular risk factor in the elderly diabetic. The benefit of proper management is well recognized, even if treatment has no influence on overall mortality or might even tend to increase it in very elderly subjects. Globally, the efficacy of the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor antagonists appears to be equivalent so that the therapeutic choice depends on the type of hypertension, systolic or systolic-diastolic, and the rapidity of the desired effect, co-morbid conditions, particularly coronary or renal disease, or drug tolerance. Blood pressure goals are similar to those in middle-aged persons, except in very old, frail or sick subjects.", 
    "743": "The congestive heart failure syndrome includes a systemic illness with wasting of soft tissues and bone. We hypothesized secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) would be found in hospitalized patients with decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), where secondary aldosteronism is expected, and who were either untreated or treated medically.", 
    "744": "In 9 consecutive patients (7 males, 2 females; 8 African-American, 1 Caucasian; 33-60 yrs) admitted to the Regional Medical Center during a 28-day period with chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF<35%) and decompensated CHF (5 untreated; 4 treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, furosemide, and small-dose spironolactone), we measured: plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH); serum calcium corrected for albumin, magnesium, and phosphorus; serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance.", 
    "745": "Plasma PTH was elevated above the normal range (6-65 pg/mL) in both untreated and treated patients with CHF (204+/-60 and 134+/-14 pg/mL, respectively). Serum corrected calcium was normal (8.4-10.2 mg/dL) in both untreated and treated CHF (9.7+/-0.l and 9.1+/-0.2 mg/dL, respectively) as were serum magnesium and phosphorus. Calculated creatinine clearance did not differ between untreated and treated patients (74+/-15 and 83+/-21 mL/min, respectively).", 
    "746": "Secondary HPT was found in 5 untreated and 4 treated patients consecutively hospitalized over a 28-day period with decompensated CHF. Corrected serum calcium was normal. Plasmaionized calcium, a determinant of PTH secretion, was not measured. Although vitamin D levels were not assessed, the presence of hypovitaminosis D in these housebound patients with symptomatic CHF cannot be discounted. HPT may contribute to the systemic illness that accompanies CHF, including bone wasting.", 
    "747": "Almost one third of adults in the United States have hypertension. Prevalence data among different racial or ethnic groups indicate that a disproportionate number of African Americans have hypertension compared with non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans. Earlier onset of high blood pressure and greater severity of hypertension contribute to a greater burden of hypertensive target organ damage in African Americans and may be a factor in the shorter life expectancy of this population compared with white Americans. There is a clear need for improved management of hypertension in African Americans via therapeutic lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy. While there is some evidence that particular antihypertensive agent classes provide blood pressure-lowering advantages over others, there is no support for withholding agents of any one class. When given as monotherapy, diuretics and calcium channel blockers may be relatively more effective in lowering blood pressure in African Americans than beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers. However, when combined with a diuretic, African Americans respond as well to these agents as other racial groups. Combination therapy using antihypertensive agents with differing modes of action provides additive antihypertensive efficacy and is well tolerated. Recent guidelines recommend combination therapy as the standard of care for patients with significant blood pressure elevation, especially those with diabetes mellitus and renal disease. These comorbidities are more common in African Americans and indicate the potential need for initial therapy with more than one agent or a combination of agents in one pill.", 
    "748": "Data from well designed randomized trials have proven the effectiveness of an intensive approach to hypertension management in reducing morbidity and mortality. Based on these data, guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal of <140/90 mm Hg in the general population, with lower goals for high-risk patients. Clinical trials also show that most patients will require at least two antihypertensive agents to reach goal. Despite this evidence base, only about one third of individuals with hypertension receive sufficient therapy to attain a blood pressure of <140/90 mm Hg. Physicians may be reluctant to use multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve this goal because they may consider it to be \"aggressive\" and not always in the best interests of the patient, especially in those deemed at low risk. Such perceptions may be founded on several myths: 1) the approach demands a complex, time-consuming titration-to-response strategy, during which the patient may be lost to follow-up; 2) it increases the pill burden, which will decrease patient compliance; 3) it increases treatment-related side effects; and 4) it is not cost-effective. The availability of fixed-dose combinations containing two antihypertensive agents should help to dispel these myths. Careful selection of efficacious, well tolerated, once-daily, fixed-dose combinations allows goal blood pressure to be achieved quickly in a broad range of patients and encourages patient concordance with therapy. Such formulations are also cost-effective. Thus, reducing blood pressure using multiple drugs as fixed-dose combinations is a strategy that recognizes the multiple pathophysiologic changes that lead to hypertension.", 
    "749": "The structure of the resistance vessels in patients with essential hypertension is altered, with reduction of the lumen diameter and increase in wall-to-lumen ratio without change in wall mass, known as eutrophic remodelling. The alteration appears to cause a reduction in the vascular reserve, in particular the coronary reserve (the ability to increase blood flow during hyperaemia). Successful treatment of hypertension should therefore seek not only to reduce blood pressure but also to normalize the structure of the resistance vessels. The available evidence shows that the effect of antihypertensive treatment on resistance vessel structure is variable and not related to the reduction in blood pressure. Instead it appears that the key feature allowing normalization of vascular structure is the ability of the treatment to cause a reduction in total peripheral resistance. Thus beta-blocker treatment is apparently unable to correct the abnormal vascular structure, although vasodilator treatment - for example with angiotensin coverting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors - is able to do this. In vivo studies in rats, and in vitro organ culture experiments have suggested that the remodelling is related to the activation of the vascular smooth muscle. The process seems to be mediated at least in part by tissue transglutaminase, an enzyme which specifically controls the interaction of smooth muscle with the extracellular matrix. Taken together the data support the desirability of vasodilator therapy in the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "750": "Healthy endothelium is essential for undisturbed functioning of the cardiovascular system, while endothelial dysfunction leads to its various pathologies. For example endothelial dysfunction precedes clinical symptoms of atherothrombosis, such as acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease or diabetic microangiopathies e.g. retinopathy and nephropathy. Accordingly, pharmacological reversal of endothelial dysfunction may represent a new approach in preventing the aforementioned vasculopathies. In modern cardiovascular pharmacology, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-I) or inhibitors of HydroxyMethylGlutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (statins) are among the most widely used cardiovascular drugs. Originally, ACE-I and statins were introduced to clinical medicine to lower arterial blood pressure or to lower blood LDL cholesterol levels, respectively. They were respectively targeted to inhibit ACE in blood or to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase in the liver. Surprisingly, these two classes of drugs apart from their classic mechanisms of action exert pleiotropic endothelial actions, which involve the inhibition of ACE or HMG-CoA reductase within the endothelium, as well as other less understood endothelial mechanisms. Typically, therapeutic effectiveness of ACE-I by far exceeds the benefits expected from their hypotensive effect or as the matter of fact of other hypotensive drugs. Similarly, statins offer cardiovascular protection irrespective of initial LDL cholesterol levels in patients. In our view, it is the endothelial action of ACE-I or statins that contributes significantly to their anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and vasculoprotective actions. Importantly, actions of ACE-I or statins are not limited to the correction of functioning of a single endothelial mediator, but they do possess a broader spectrum of endotheliotropic properties that proved efficient in preventing atherothrombosis and other vasculopathies. Quite surprisingly, the history of ACE-I and statins has a major impact for the future development in pharmacology of endothelium.", 
    "751": "With the aim to determine the influence of reducing systolic blood pressure in urinary TGF-beta1 of type 2 diabetes (DM2) with diabetic nephropathy (DN), 21 subjects with type 2 diabetes and proteinuria >500 mg/24 h were studied. Amlodipine and ramipril were added to their previous antihypertensive treatment for 12 weeks. Urinary TGF-beta1 (UTGF-beta1) was determined at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Plasma TGF-beta1 was determined at 0 and 12 weeks. Subjects whose mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) during treatment were under 140 mmHg were grouped as the better SBP controlled group (n = 11) and those with SBP equal to or greater than 140 mHg were grouped in a moderate SBP controlled group (n = 10). Compared to baseline, mean log UTGF-beta1 at 4, 8 and 12 weeks decreased (-0.22 +/- 0.15 pg/mg; p = 0.04) in better SBP controlled group but not in the moderate SBP controlled group (-0.12 +/- 0.08 pg/mg, p = 0.82). Mean SBP correlated with UTGF-beta1 (r = 0.458, p = 0.0357), and this effect was independent of HbA1c (p = 0.042). By controlling SBP in DM2 subjects with DN we might decrease UTGF-beta1. We propose that reduction of UTGF-beta1 is due to a decrease in renal TGF-beta1 production.", 
    "752": "A simple, rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma samples was developed. Captopril was derivatized with 2,4'-dibromoacetophenone (pBPB) to form a captopril-pBPB adduct. From acidified serum plasma samples, the hydrochlorothiazide and derivatized captopril was extracted with 5 ml ether, then with 5 ml dichloromethane. Effective chromatographic separation was achieved using a C(18) column (DIAMONSIL 150 mmx4 mm i.d., 5 microm) based on an acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid-water gradient elution at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The internal standard (IS), derivatized captopril and hydrochlorothiazide were detected at 263 nm and were eluted at 4.2, 6.8 and 16.9 min, respectively. No endogenous substances were found to interfere. The limit of quantification for hydrochlorothiazide and derivatized captopril in plasma were 3.3 and 7 ng/ml. The calibration curve for derivatized captopril showed linearity in the range 20-4000 ng/ml, with a regression coefficient corresponding to 0.9993 and the coefficient of the variation of the points of the calibration curve being lower than 10%. The calibration curve for hydrochlorothiazide showed linearity in the range 10-1200 ng/ml, with a regression coefficient corresponding to 0.9999 and the coefficient of the variation of the points of the calibration curve being lower than 10%. The method was suitably validated and successfully applied to the determination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma samples.", 
    "753": "Myocardial infarction (MI) activates the renin-angiotensin system in the heart and increases local production of aldosterone. This hormone may increase reactive fibrosis in the myocardium favoring heart failure development. To elucidate the potential contribution of aldosterone to cardiac remodeling following MI, we evaluated the expression of mineralocorticoid receptors (MCR) in the left ventricle (LV) and kidney of rats after MI and captopril treatment. MI was induced by ligation of the coronary artery in Wistar rats, which were separated into (1) sham-operated group, (2) MI group, (3) MI-captopril treated group (cap, 50 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). One month later angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was assayed in the plasma, LV and kidney. Cardiac and renal angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were determined by ELISA and MCR mRNA expression and protein were measured by Taqman RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cardiac MCR mRNA and protein levels increased nearly by 80% after MI and Cap treatment normalized cardiac MCR protein and mRNA expression. Kidney MCR expression was not affected. ACE activity increased 34% in the plasma and 83% in the LV after MI. This increase was prevented by Cap. Ang II concentration increased 225% in the LV and 193% in kidney, which was partially attenuated by Cap. Our data demonstrate upregulation of MCR in the heart following MI what may facilitate the effects of aldosterone in the ventricular remodeling process. ACE inhibitors may reduce reactive fibrosis not only by decreasing Ang II production but also by attenuating the aldosterone-signaling pathway by decreasing the expression of MCR receptors.", 
    "754": "Underlying causes, risk factors, and precipitating causes of heart failure (HF) should be treated. Drugs known to precipitate or aggravate HF should be stopped. Patients with HF and an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (systolic heart failure) or normal LVEF (diastolic HF) should be treated with diuretics if fluid retention is present; with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker if the patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor because of cough, angioneurotic edema, rash, or altered taste sensation; and with a beta blocker unless contraindicated. If severe systolic HF persists, an aldosterone antagonist should be added. If HF persists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be added. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided if systolic HF is present. Digoxin should be avoided in men and women with diastolic HF if sinus rhythm is present and in women with systolic HF. Digoxin should be given to men with systolic HF if symptoms persist, but the serum digoxin level should be maintained between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL. A multidisciplinary approach should be used with nurse monitoring of the condition. In a home-bound patient, a homemaker should be hired.",

We also compared the effects of 25 mg AVE7688 with those of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade induced by a high dose of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (300 mg irbesartan) and a dual blockade of the RAS (150 mg irbesartan plus 10 mg ramipril) in sodium-replete normotensive subjects by use of the same study design. The in vivo inhibition of ACE and NEP was monitored by measuring the urinary excretion of N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), respectively. The intensity of RAS blockade was assessed by the increase in plasma active renin concentration.",

The 25-mg dose of AVE7866 significantly and transiently (4 to 8 hours after drug intake) increased urinary ANP (2.02 +/- 1.05 ng/h, P < .05), whereas 5 mg AVE7688 (1.14 +/- 0.77 ng/h) and 10 mg ramipril (0.93 +/- 0.65 ng/h) had no effect compared with placebo (0.80 +/- 0.37 ng/h). In the low-salt panel the rise in plasma active renin concentration achieved 24 hours after dosing by 25 mg AVE7688 (247 pg/mL [95% CI, 157-389 pg/mL], P < .05) was significantly higher than that achieved by 5 mg AVE7688 (129 pg/mL [95% CI, 75-221 pg/mL]) or 10 mg ramipril (113 pg/mL [95% CI, 67-193 pg/mL]), which did not differ. In the high-salt panel group the effects of 25 mg AVE7688 on renin release did not significantly differ from those after administration of the combination of 150 mg irbesartan plus 10 mg ramipril or 300 mg irbesartan alone.

Many randomized trials have established the efficacy of statins, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for reducing cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with coronary heart disease. Since 2002, American and European guidelines have emphasized the importance of optimal utilization of those four main therapeutic classes. Nevertheless, drugs prescription registries conducted in France since 1995 revealed a persistent gap between evidence based medicine and clinical practice, only a minority of patient received an optimal treatment. Some factors associated with lower rate prescription have been identified: elderly patients, female gender, missing of LDL-cholesterol measurement, history of peripheral artery disease or stroke, and finally the difficulty of observance. At this time, optimization of management of these patients require a systematic measurement of LDL-cholestererol level for all patients with CAD, PAD or history of stroke, a larger prescription of statins in female patients and in elderly particularly for secondary prevention. Increasing observance which is the main challenge could involved the utilization of fixed drugs associations.",

Clinical manifestations vary considerably and generally do not allow differentiation between IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions (e.g. from nonspecific mediator release). Successful management of these patients requires multidisciplinary approach and involves prompt recognition and treatment by the attending physician, and identification of the offending agent(s) with subsequent avoidance of the incriminated compound(s).

    "776": "Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are involved in pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis. Recent studies have shown that blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) attenuates pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis. However, there are few data about the direct effects of high glucose on extracellular matrix (ECM) protein synthesis and angiotensin II (Ang II) induction in PSCs. PSCs were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in medium containing 5.5 mM (LG group) or 27 mM D-glucose (HG group). Levels of Ang II and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in culture media were measured and Ang II-positive cells were counted. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect Ang II receptor expression and Western blot analysis for the expression of ECM proteins such as connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF) and collagen type IV. Cells were also treated with an Ang II-receptor antagonist (candesartan, 10 microM) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramiprilat, 100 nM). Thymidine uptake by PSCs increased fourfold with high glucose treatment. Ang II levels and the proportion of Ang II-positive PSCs were significantly increased after 6 h under high-glucose conditions. TGF-beta concentrations also increased significantly with high glucose. After 72 h, the expression of CTGF and collagen type IV proteins in high-glucose cultures increased significantly and this increase was effectively attenuated by the candesartan or the ramiprilat. All together, high glucose induced PSCs proliferation and ECM protein synthesis, and these effects were attenuated by an Ang II-receptor antagonist. The data suggest that pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis aggravated by hyperglycemia, and Ang II play an important role in this pathogenesis.", 
    "777": "Endothelial dysfunction is an important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure. The endothelium mediates vascular tone, structure, and function by the release and regulation of multiple vasoactive substances that promote or inhibit vasodilation, vasoconstriction, cell growth, and other mechanisms. The effect of antihypertensive drugs on endothelial function may be an important indicator of their ability to reduce risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by various antihypertensive drugs is accurately measured with high-resolution ultrasound of flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reverse endothelial dysfunction. The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers on the endothelium are believed to derive from their effects on nitric oxide production and antioxidant effects, possibly independent of blood pressure reduction. Due to their complementary mechanisms of action, it has been hypothesized that the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker will provide superior cardiovascular protection, in part by producing an additive effect of increased nitric oxide availability, when compared with either agent alone.",

Antihypertensive medications that most commonly influence serum potassium levels and/or total body potassium include beta blockers and potassium-wasting and potassium-sparing diuretics as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Uncertainty exists as to the best way to monitor potassium levels when any of these drug therapies are used, particularly in the setting of chronic kidney disease and/or heart failure.

Bisphenol A clearly enhanced OH formation and DA efflux induced by MPP(+). When imidaprilat was infused in bisphenol A and MPP(+)-treated rats, DA efflux and OH formation significantly decreased, as compared with that in the bisphenol A and MPP(+) treated control.

The results reveal that phosphoramidon elevated flare intensity, but that this was not further increased by adding captopril. In contrast, neurogenic flare was decreased when the drug mixture was applied in compared to NEP only. Electrically released CGRP levels could be measured directly in perfusates containing phosphoramidon and the mixture. Again, CGRP levels were elevated in phosphoramidon treated sites, and significantly reduced upon adding captopril. These findings suggest that NEP and ACE do not have additive effects regarding neuropeptide degradation. In contrast, inhibition of ACE seems to augment CGRP catabolism.",

The concentrations of hydroxyproline in cardiac muscle cells of the 3 treatment 12 and 24 weeks after were significantly than those of the control group and decreased gradually time-dependently. The expression of Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA 24 weeks after of the ramipril, losartan, and combination groups were 53.5%, 72.9%, and 76.7% higher than that of the control group, and the Ca(2+)-ATPase protein expression of the 3 treatment groups were 28.9%, 33.3%, and 49.3% higher than that of the control group.

    "793": "Since their discovery in the 1980s, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to decrease angiotensin formation, prevent breakdown of bradykinin, and may also act on peptides of the renin-angiotensin system. They are effective in reducing the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure, and have been shown to reduce atherosclerotic complications in patients who have vascular disease without heart failure. They may preserve endothelial function and counteract initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Broadly, ACE inhibitors can be divided into tissue specific or serum ACE inhibitors. Tissue-specific ACE inhibitors as a group are not superior to serum ACE inhibitors in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Pending direct comparator clinical trials between a tissue ACE inhibitor and a plasma ACE inhibitor, both ramipril and perindopril can be recommended for secondary risk prevention, based on the evidence.",

    "798": "Renal medullary circulation has now been found to play a fundamental role in regulating long-term blood pressure control and fluid balance. Elevation of superoxide or reduction of nitric oxide (NO) in renal medulla decreases medullary blood flow and Na excretion, resulting in sustained hypertension. Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced interaction of superoxide and NO was determined in thin tissue strips isolated from the renal outer medullary region of Sprague-Dawley rats using fluorescent microscopy techniques. Ang II can induce diffusion of NO, but not superoxide, from the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) to the surrounded vasa recta. However, when NO is reduced by the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO, Ang II can induce superoxide diffusion from mTAL to vasa recta pericytes. Therefore, the physiological action of oxidative stress in renal medullary region is demonstrated as balance of superoxide and NO diffusion (\"tubulo-vascular cross-talk\"). These results explain how chronically hypoxic medulla can maintain blood flow. In other studies using chronically instrumented rats, we found that nearly 70% of Ang II-induced medullary renal injury was dependent on pressure determined by servo-control of renal perfusion pressure, whereas 30% of the injury was non-hemodynamic. We conclude that oxidative stress within the renal medulla can induce hypertension and also make the kidney functionally more vulnerable to the effects of Ang II.", 
    "799": "We examined the influence of chronic treatment with ANG-(1-7) on development of hypertension and end-organ damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) chronically treated with the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor L-NAME (SHR-L-NAME). L-NAME administered orally (80 mg/l) for 4 wk significantly elevated mean arterial pressure (MAP) compared with SHR controls drinking regular water (269 +/- 10 vs. 196 +/- 6 mmHg). ANG-(1-7) (24 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) or captopril (300 mg/l) significantly attenuated the elevation in MAP due to L-NAME (213 +/- 7 and 228 +/- 8 mmHg, respectively), and ANG-(1-7) + captopril completely reversed the L-NAME-dependent increase in MAP (193 +/- 5 mmHg). L-NAME-induced increases in urinary protein were significantly lower in ANG-(1-7)-treated animals (226 +/- 6 vs. 145 +/- 12 mg/day). Captopril was more effective (96 +/- 12 mg/day), and there was no additional effect of captopril + ANG-(1-7) (87 +/- 5 mg/day). The abnormal vascular responsiveness to endothelin-1, carbachol, and sodium nitroprusside in perfused mesenteric vascular bed of SHR-L-NAME was improved by ANG-(1-7) or captopril, with no additive effect of ANG-(1-7) + captopril. In isolated perfused hearts, recovery of left ventricular function from 40 min of global ischemia was significantly better in ANG-(1-7)- or captopril-treated SHR-L-NAME, with additive effects of combined treatment. The beneficial effects of ANG-(1-7) on MAP and cardiac function were inhibited when indomethacin was administered with ANG-(1-7), but indomethacin did not reverse the protective effects on proteinuria or vascular reactivity. The protective effects of the ANG-(1-7) analog AVE-0991 were qualitatively comparable to those of ANG-(1-7) but were not improved over those of captopril alone. Thus, during reduced nitric oxide availability, ANG-(1-7) attenuates development of severe hypertension and end-organ damage; prostaglandins participate in the MAP-lowering and cardioprotective effects of ANG-(1-7); and additive effects of captopril + ANG-(1-7) on MAP, but not proteinuria or endothelial function, suggest common, as well as different, mechanisms of action for the two treatments. Together, the results provide further evidence of a role for ANG-(1-7) in protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and suggest dissociation of factors influencing MAP and those influencing end-organ damage.",

    "811": "The crystal structure of a Drosophila angiotensin-converting enzyme (ANCE) has recently been solved, revealing features important for the binding of ACE inhibitors and allowing molecular comparisons with the structure of human testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE). ACER is a second Drosophila ACE that displays both common and distinctive properties. Here we report further functional differences between ANCE and ACER and have constructed a homology model of ACER to help explain these. The model predicts a lack of the Cl(-)-binding sites, and therefore the strong activation of ACER activity towards enkephalinamide peptides by NaCl suggests alternative sites for Cl(-) binding. There is a marked difference in the electrostatic charge of the substrate channel between ANCE and ACER, which may explain why the electropositive peptide, MKRSRGPSPRR, is cleaved efficiently by ANCE with a low K(m), but does not bind to ACER. Bradykinin (BK) peptides are excellent ANCE substrates. Models of BK docked in the substrate channel suggest that the peptide adopts an N-terminal beta-turn, permitting a tight fit of the peptide in the substrate channel. This, together with ionic interactions between the guanidino group of Arg9 of BK and the side chains of Asp360 and Glu150 in the S(2)' pocket, are possible reasons for the high-affinity binding of BK. The replacement of Asp360 with a histidine in ACER would explain the higher K(m) recorded for the hydrolysis of BK peptides by this enzyme. Other differences in the S(2)' site of ANCE and ACER also explain the selectivity of RXPA380, a selective inhibitor of human C-domain ACE, which also preferentially inhibits ACER. These structural and enzymatic studies provide insight into the molecular basis for the distinctive enzymatic features of ANCE and ACER.", 
    "812": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Dopamine receptors are involved in the regulation of renal hemodynamics and may play a role in diabetes-induced hyperfiltration. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the renal effect of a dopamine D3 receptor antagonist (D3-RA) in hypertensive type II diabetic SHR/N-cp rats. Lean and obese SHR/N-cp rats were randomly assigned to D3-RA, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i), or D3-RA+ACE-i treatment or control conditions. Treated animals were given the D3-RA A-437203 (10 mg/kg/body weight (BW)/day) or the ACE-i trandolapril (0.3 mg/kg BW/day) or a combination of both. At 6 months following perfusion, fixed kidneys were analyzed by morphological and stereological methods. Indices of renal damage (glomerulosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis damage index (GSI), tubulointerstitial and vascular damage), glomerular geometry and functional variables such as urinary albumin excretion, glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, blood chemistry and BW were determined. The GSI (score 0-4) was significantly higher (P<0.05) in untreated diabetic animals (1.62+/-0.3) compared to nondiabetic controls (0.4+/-0.2) and the treatment groups (D3-RA: 0.31+/-0.12; ACE-i: 0.29+/-0.1; combination treatment: 0.12+/-0.01). Urinary albumin excretion (mg/24 h) was higher in untreated diabetic controls (102+/-19) compared to nondiabetic controls (31+/-12) and the treatment groups (D3-RA: 44+/-15; ACE-i: 41+/-13; combination treatment: 15+/-8). Mean glomerular volume was higher in untreated diabetic animals compared to nondiabetic controls and to the treatment groups. Desmin expression, a marker of podocyte damage, was elevated in untreated diabetic controls and diminished in all treatment groups. These data suggest that in a model of type II diabetes, the dopamine D3-RA had a beneficial effect on renal morphology and albuminuria, which was comparable in magnitude to that of ACE-i treatment.",

    "834": "Patients admitted with first AMI between 1995 and 2002 were identified by linking nationwide administrative registers. A total of 55 315 patients survived 30 days after discharge and were included; 58.3% received beta-blockers, 29.1% ACE-inhibitors, and 33.5% statins. After 1, 3, and 5 years, 78, 64, and 58% of survivors who had started therapy were still receiving beta-blockers, 86, 78, and 74% were receiving ACE-inhibitors, and 85, 80, and 82% were receiving statins, respectively. Increased age and female sex were associated with improved compliance. The dosages prescribed were generally 50% or less of the dosages used in clinical trials, and dosages did not increase during the observation period. Patients who did not start treatment shortly after discharge had a low probability of starting treatment later.", 
    "835": "The main problem with underuse of recommended treatment after AMI is that treatment is not initiated at an appropriate dosage shortly after AMI. A focused effort in the immediate post-infarction period would appear to provide long-term benefit.", 
    "836": "Coronary heart disease is still highly prevalent worldwide, and stable angina pectoris is one of its more common presentations. Three major controversies are risk factor management, drug therapy, and intervention. As well as the major risk factors stated by the Framingham study and European guidelines, other factors include abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome, and psychological stress. How should these additional factors be rated? With respect to drug therapy, apart from aspirin, all patients with stable angina should be assessed for statin treatment. Although statins will reduce coronary events by about one third in patients with vascular disease, the absolute benefit depends on the absolute risk. Non-controversially, all patients should be considered for angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. The concept that beta blockers are protective from future coronary events can be disputed. Percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve symptoms without extending lifespan beyond medical therapy. However, strong mortality data favour coronary-artery bypass grafting in individuals with triple-vessel or even double-vessel disease. Thus, effort angina needs comprehensive assessment, lifestyle changes, and treatment tailored to the individual patient.", 
    "837": "Left ventricular (LV) remodeling (ie, enlargement and functional deterioration occurring over time) is among the main mechanisms of progression in heart failure (HF). LV dilatation and dysfunction are major negative prognostic markers in patients with HF. Treatments that are effective in limiting or even reversing this process can be expected to provide clinical benefit. Changes in LV dimensions rather than in ejection fraction should be used to monitor remodeling. Ejection fraction can be influenced by transient loading conditions and by agents that stimulate contractility at the expense of increased oxygen demand, whereas dimensional changes probably reflect structural modifications occurring in the myocardium. The neurohormonal antagonists that have been demonstrated to reduce mortality and morbidity in HF (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE], beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists) are also able to inhibit or reverse remodeling. In reverse remodeling, beta-blockers appear to be superior to the other classes of drugs, with a stronger correlation between dose and effect, but it must be remembered that they have been tested as an addition to background therapy that may include ACE inhibitors. With regard to nonpharmacologic strategies, biventricular pacing is associated with functional improvement and reverse remodeling in patients with advanced HF and electromechanical dyssynchrony, and it recently has been demonstrated to improve survival in a randomized clinical trial.", 
    "838": "Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic, persistent activation of the neuroendocrine system, which has been assumed to be linked to disease progression and adverse outcomes. Clinical trials have shown that adrenergic modulators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone blockers, and beta-blockers, improve long-term outcomes in patients with HF. These findings have led to the hypothesis that inhibition of a single neurohormonal or cytokine pathway may continue to provide incremental benefits. However, the results of recent clinical trials, using centrally acting agents--endopeptidase inhibitors or endothelin and cytokine antagonists--suggest that selective inhibition of neurohormonal systems may not be advantageous and actually may have serious adverse effects. The reasons for this lack of benefit may be ascribed to the fact that long-term mortality benefits in patients with chronic HF are primarily the result of treatment of the diseases that have caused HF in the first place rather than treatment of neurohormonal abnormalities.", 
    "839": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have complicated and poorly characterized pharmacokinetics. There are two binding sites per ACE (high affinity \"C\", lower affinity \"N\") that have sub-nanomolar affinities and dissociation rates of hours. Most inhibitors are given orally in a prodrug form that is systemically converted to the active form. This paper describes the first human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of this drug class.", 
    "840": "The model was applied to the experimental data of van Griensven et. al for the pharmacokinetics of ramiprilat and its prodrug ramipril. It describes the time course of the inhibition of the N and C ACE sites in plasma and the different tissues. The model includes: 1) two independent ACE binding sites; 2) non-equilibrium time dependent binding; 3) liver and kidney ramipril intracellular uptake, conversion to ramiprilat and extrusion from the cell; 4) intestinal ramipril absorption. The experimental in vitro ramiprilat/ACE binding kinetics at 4 degrees C and 300 mM NaCl were assumed for most of the PBPK calculations.

Summary of model features: Less than 2% of total body ACE is in plasma; 35% of the oral dose is absorbed; 75% of the ramipril metabolism is hepatic and 25% of this is converted to systemic ramiprilat; 100% of renal ramipril metabolism is converted to systemic ramiprilat. The inhibition was long lasting, with 80% of the C site and 33% of the N site inhibited 24 hours following a 2.5 mg oral ramipril dose. The plasma ACE inhibition determined by the standard assay is significantly less than the true in vivo inhibition because of assay dilution.",

    "850": "Hypertension is common in chronic renal disease and is a risk factor for the faster progression of renal damage, and reduction of blood pressure (BP) is an efficient way of preventing or slowing the progression of this damage. International guidelines recommend lowering BP to 140/90 mm Hg or less in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, and to 130/80 mm Hg or less for patients with diabetic or chronic renal disease. The attainment of these goals needs to be aggressively pursued with multidrug antihypertensive regimens, if needed. The pathogenesis of hypertensive renal damage involves mediators from various extracellular systems, including the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Proteinuria, which occurs as a consequence of elevated intraglomerular pressure, is also directly nephrotoxic. As well as protecting the kidneys by reducing BP, antihypertensive drugs can also have direct effects on intrarenal mechanisms of damage, such as increased glomerular pressure and proteinuria. Antihypertensive drugs that have direct effects on intrarenal mechanisms may, therefore, have nephroprotective effects additional to those resulting from reductions in arterial BP. Whereas BP-lowering effects are common to all antihypertensive drugs, intrarenal effects differ between classes and between individual drugs within certain classes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have beneficial effects on proteinuria and declining renal function that appear to be mediated by factors additional to their effects on BP. These RAS inhibitors are recommended as a first-line antihypertensive approach in patients with chronic kidney disease. The addition of diuretics and calcium channel antagonists to RAS inhibitor therapy is also considered to be a rational strategy to reduce BP and preserve renal function. Calcium channel antagonists are a highly heterogeneous class of compounds, and it appears that some agents are more suitable for use in patients with chronic renal disease than others. Manidipine is a third-generation dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonist that blocks both L and T-type calcium channels. Unlike older-generation DHPs, which preferentially act on L-type channels, manidipine has been shown to have beneficial effects on intrarenal haemodynamics, proteinuria and other measures of renal functional decline in the first clinical trials involving hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure. Preliminary results from a trial in diabetic patients who had uncontrolled hypertension and microalbuminuria despite optimal therapy with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB suggest that manidipine may be an excellent antihypertensive drug in combination with RAS inhibitor treatment in order to normalise BP and albumin excretion in patients with diabetes.", 
    "851": "Manidipine is a lipophilic, third-generation, highly vasoselective, dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonist, which, when given on a once-daily basis, effectively reduces blood pressure (BP) in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Manidipine has a gradual onset and a long duration of action, effectively maintaining reduced BP levels throughout the 24-hour dosing period, and is effective in the long term with no evidence of intolerance. The BP-lowering capacity of manidipine is similar to that of other established DHPs and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Diabetic patients and very elderly patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension also respond favourably to treatment with manidipine. Manidipine has neutral effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and is generally well tolerated. Manidipine thus represents a first-line option for lowering BP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "852": "Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA) are gaining increasing popularity as initial medications for the management of hypertensive patients. In the year 2002, ACE-I were the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of hypertension in USA. Although their antihypertensive efficacy as monotherapy is similar to other antihypertensive agents, they have the advantage of better tolerability, limited side effects and a favorable metabolic profile. When compared to other antihypertensive agents (diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium antagonists) in large clinical trials, ACE-I and ARA provided no additional advantages regarding improvement in cardiovascular and total mortality. With the exception of the superiority of ARA in prevention of stroke, RAS inhibitors have no advantage over other agents in prevention of other cardiovascular morbid events, namely, heart failure (though ACE-I are superior to calcium antagonists), coronary heart disease and total cardiovascular events. However, there is the possibility that these agents have other benefits beyond blood pressure lowering. At equal degrees of blood pressure reduction, RAS inhibitors prevent or delay the development of diabetes mellitus and provide better end-organ protection, kidneys, blood vessels and the heart when compared with other antihypertensive agents. The combined use of ACE-I and ARA is particularly useful in organ protection. RAS inhibitors are specifically indicated in the treatment of hypertension in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function, diabetes, proteinuria, impaired kidney function, myocardial infarction, multiple cardiovascular risk factors and possibly elderly patients. The main limitation of the ACE-I is cough and rarely angioedema. Elderly patients or those who are volume depleted or receiving large doses of diuretics or in heart failure are liable to develop hypotensive reaction and/or deterioration in kidney function.", 
    "853": "Recently, a lot of multi-center clinical studies about calcium (Ca) blockade and cardiovascular diseases have been investigated. Though the ability to reduce blood pressure is the most important thing, much attention is also paid to the effect of organ protection effect beyond blood pressure lowering. Compared to angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor (ACE-I), amlodipine among Ca channel blockers shows excellent protective effect of cardiovascular disease. As specified to the kidney disease, renin-angiotensin (RA) inhibition by ARB or ACE-I is much effective than Ca blockade, however, Ca channel blocker is thought to be the first choice as for the blood pressure lowering of ischemic heart disease patients. From now on, further studies will be expected to prove not only the effect of RA system drugs, but also Ca channel blockers, moreover, to know the differences of benefit among many Ca channel blockers.", 
    "854": "Atrial fibrillation is very common in the United States. After a search of Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL, 4 trials evaluating inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system were identified for prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation, facilitation of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, and prevention of atrial fibrillation recurrence after electrical cardioversion. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) was associated with a reduction in new-onset atrial fibrillation (OR [95% CI] = 0.51 [0.36-0.72]), a lower failure rate of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (0.47 [0.24-0.92]), and a lower rate of recurrence of atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion (0.39 [0.20-0.75]). With the exception of the new-onset atrial fibrillation analysis, these findings were not associated with statistical heterogeneity. These hypothesis-generating data suggest that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may provide benefit across the spectrum of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "855": "We investigated the functional roles of circulating and locally produced angiotensin II (Ang II) in fasting and postprandial adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) regulation and examined the interaction between Ang II and nitric oxide (NO) in ATBF regulation. Local effects of the pharmacological agents (or contralateral saline) on ATBF, measured with 133Xe wash-out, were assessed using the recently developed microinfusion technique. Fasting and postprandial (75 g glucose challenge) ATBF regulation was investigated in nine lean healthy subjects (age, 29 +/- 3 years; BMI, 23.4 +/- 0.7 kg m(-2)) using local Ang II stimulation, Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Furthermore, NO synthase (NOS) blockade alone and in combination with AT1 receptor blockade was used to examine the interaction between Ang II and NO. Ang II induced a dose-dependent decrease in ATBF (10(-9)m: -16%, P = 0.04; 10(-7)m: -33%, P < 0.01; 10(-5)m: -53%P < 0.01). Fasting ATBF was not affected by ACE inhibition, but was increased by approximately 55% (P < 0.01) by AT(1) receptor blockade. NOS blockade induced a approximately 30% (P = 0.001) decrease in fasting ATBF. Combined AT1 receptor and NOS blockade increased ATBF by approximately 40% (P = 0.003). ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade did not affect the postprandial increase in ATBF. We therefore conclude that circulating Ang II is a major regulator of fasting ATBF, and a major proportion of the Ang II-induced decrease in ATBF is NO independent. Locally produced Ang II does not appear to regulate ATBF. Ang II appears to have no major effect on the postprandial enhancement of ATBF.", 
    "856": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the leading cause of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in childhood and the most common form of end stage renal disease (ESRD) from glomerular disease. In order to assess the risk of progression of children with primary FSGS and the impact of proteinuria remission status on disease progression, we undertook this study to describe a cohort of 60 children and adolescents from the Glomerular Disease Collaborative Network. Of the 60 patients included in the cohort, 58% were African American. Median age was 16 years. Proteinuria ranged from 1.0-24.0 g/day/1.73 m(2); 57% were hypertensive, and the median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 90.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Complete remission was achieved in 20%, partial remission in 33%, and 47% have not achieved remission during follow-up with all prescribed therapy. Only ACE-I/ARB therapy was predictive of proteinuria remission in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 3.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-7.92). Renal survival was much improved in patients with complete or partial remission compared with no remission in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis comparing no remission status, complete remission was associated with a 90% decreased risk of ESRD (HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.79, p =0.03). In summary, proteinuria remission status is a valid predictor of long-term renal survival in children with FSGS.", 
    "857": "Today angiotensin II inhibition is primarily used to slow the rate of progression of kidney diseases. There is evidence that these therapies can induce a partial regression of glomerular lesions. However, we do not know yet the extent of sclerotic lesion regression and whether new glomerular tissue is formed to help support the renal function. We used male Munich Wistar Fromter (MWF) rats, an experimental model for progressive kidney disease, to quantify kidney structural lesions upon angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition therapy. Animals were studied at 50 weeks of age, when renal function and structure are severely altered, and after a 10-week observation period, without or with treatment with lisinopril (80 mg/l in drinking water). A group of untreated Wistar rats was used as controls. With age, proteinuria, and serum creatinine worsen, but lisinopril almost normalized proteinuria and stabilized serum creatinine. Serial section analysis of whole glomerular tufts showed that at baseline, glomerulosclerosis affected the entire glomerular population, and that these changes further increased with age. Lisinopril significantly reduced incidence and extent of glomerulosclerosis, with the presence of glomerular tufts not affected by sclerosis (23% of glomeruli). Glomerular volume was not significantly affected by treatment, and glomerular mass spared from sclerosis increased from 46.9 to 65.5% upon treatment, indicating consistent regeneration of glomerular tissue. Lisinopril normalized baseline glomerular transforming growth factor-beta and alpha-smooth muscle actin overexpression, and prevented worsening of interstitial changes. Hence, ACE inhibition, which is widely used in human kidney disease, may not only halt the progression of renal failure, but also actually induce the regeneration of new renal tissue.", 
    "858": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion(I)/deletion (D) polymorphism may modify the effect of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on survival and cardiorenal outcomes in type 2, diabetes. A consecutive cohort of 2089 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with mean (+/- standard deviation) age of 59.7 +/- 13.1 years were genotyped for this polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction method and were followed prospectively for a median period of 44.6 (interquartile range: 23.7, 57.5) months. Clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and renal end points, were examined. The frequency for I allele was 67.1 and 32.9% for D allele, with observed genotype frequencies of 45.8, 42.6, and 11.6% for 3, DI and DD, respectively. ACE DD polymorphism was an independent predictor for renal end point with hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval) of 1.72 (1.16, 2.56), but not for cardiovascular end point or mortality. After controlling for confounding factors, including ACE I/D genotype, the usage of RAAS inhibitors was associated with reduced risk of mortality (HR 0.34 (0.23, 0.50)) and renal end point (HR 0.55 (0.40, 0.75)). On subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects on survival (II vs DI vs DD: HR 0.29 (0.16, 0.51) vs 0.25 (0.14, 0.46) vs 1.33 (0.41, 4.31)) and renoprotection (II vs DI vs DD: 0.52 (0.30, 0.90) vs 0.43 (0.25, 0.72) vs 0.95 (0.43, 2.12)) were most evident in II and DI carriers. In conclusion, inhibition of RAAS was associated with reduced risk of mortality and occurrence of renal end point in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. These benefits were most evident among II and DI carriers.", 
    "859": "Interactions between carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine), being plentiful in skeletal muscles and neuronal tissues, and captopril, a widely used angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were examined concerning free radical scavenging activity and ACE activity in vitro. Not only captopril, but also carnosine, at concentrations less than those ordinarily found in muscles and neuronal tissues, significantly scavenged 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) radical cations, and inhibited ACE activity. Cupric ions reversed the ABTS scavenging activity of carnosine and captopril, whereas cupric ions strengthened the inhibitory action of carnosine on ACE activity. In contrast, cupric ions antagonized the inhibition of ACE activity induced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, indicating that the inhibitory effect of carnosine on ACE activity is not related to the chelating action of carnosine. On the other hand, carnosine and captopril synergistically enhanced the free radical scavenging activity, but not the inhibitory effect on the ACE activity. These data suggest that carnosine in its concurrent use with captopril could act as a beneficial free radical scavenger, with less danger of overdose, in the inhibition of ACE activity.", 
    "860": "Hydroxymethyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibition (statin) therapy has been shown to reduce cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the influence of short-term statin therapy on left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute myocardial in-farction. Thirty-five patients with first anterior acute myocardial infarction, who underwent primary coronary angioplasty within 12 hours of onset, were divided into 2 groups. Ten patients taking statin served as the statin group, and 25 patients not taking statin served as the control group. Two-dimensional echocardiography was recorded after angioplasty (baseline) and at 4 weeks. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline was not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, the statin group had a higher LVEF at 4 weeks than the control group (58.2 +/- 5.0 versus 49.0 +/- 12.7%; P < 0.05). Moreover, the increase in LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) at 4 weeks was lower in the statin group than in the control group (12.1 +/- 29.6 versus 39.9 +/- 35.7 mL; P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that administration of statin was an independent factor for the increase in LVEDV (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that short-term statin therapy can prevent postinfarct LV remodeling and improve LV function.", 
    "861": "It is of concern that women are more likely to undergo fewer diagnostic tests and receive less treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than men. However, it is still unclear whether gender differences exist according to age groups. Therefore, we studied the influence of gender on the delivery of cardiac management according to two age groups (< 65, >or= 65) in Japan. Data from the Tokai Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (TAMIS) sample were used. This is a retrospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the 13 acute care hospitals in the Tokai region of Japan, which includes Aichi and Shizuoka Prefectures, with a diagnosis of AMI from 1995 to 1997. A total of 143 younger women, 822 younger men, 391 older women, and 611 older men were included. Information concerning patient demographics, in-hospital course, comorbid conditions, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound-echocardiography (UCG), treadmill test (TMT), coronary angiography (CAG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital or discharge medication (thrombolytics, vasopressors, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, nitrates) were collected. Among the young, after controlling for these baseline variables, women were significantly less likely to undergo PTCA compared to men (OR, 0.54, 95%CI, 0.35-0.82). After controlling for these baseline variables, only lipid-lowering therapy tended to be more frequent in women than in men among the elderly (OR, 2.79, 95%CI, 1.47-2.58). The findings suggest that younger women with AMI are less likely than younger men to undergo PTCA, and that older women with AMI are more likely to receive lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "862": "A simple and sensitive kinetic spectrophotometric method for the determination of perindopril in pharmaceutical preparations is described. The method is based on the interaction of drug with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 40+/-1 degrees C. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of change of the absorbance at 420 nm. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the calibration curve showed a linear relationship over the concentration range of 20-140 microg/ml. The activation parameter such as E(a), deltaH*, deltaS* and deltaG* for this reaction were calculated and found to be 27.31 kJ/mol, 24.69 kJ/mol, -138.84 J/K/mol and 61.50 kJ/mol, respectively. The method has been successfully applied to the determination of perindopril in commercial dosage forms. Statistical comparison of the results with the Abdellatef's spectrophotometric method shows excellent agreement and indicates no significant difference between the methods compared in terms of accuracy and precision.", 
    "863": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases, characterized mainly by macrovesicular steatosis in the absence of significant alcohol ingestion. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis once considered a benign process is now known to lead to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. Histologically indistinguishable from alcoholic liver disease, the exact aetiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease remains unknown, but the fundamental pathophysiological process appears to be insulin resistance and oxidative stress related to the metabolic syndrome. Therapy has focused on risk factors, weight reduction and pharmacological intervention. Promising pharmacological treatments have been demonstrated with antioxidants, insulin sensitizers, hepatoprotectants and lipid-lowering agents. However, without larger randomized studies, no pharmacological treatments can be recommended at this time.", 
    "864": "Long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockades have been shown to limit the progression of atherosclerosis and decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events in humans and animals. To investigate the vasoprotective effects beyond the blood pressure-lowering effects of these agents, amlodipine (20 mg/kg/ day) and manidipine (10 mg/kg/day) were administered by gavage to N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats for 2 weeks. L-NAME treatment (0.7 mg/ml in drinking water) significantly decreased the gene and protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA levels in the aorta, as determined by Western blotting and reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amlodipine and manidipine normalized the decreased expression of eNOS gene and protein, and attenuated the overexpression of NADPH oxidase, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 mRNA. Furthermore, amlodipine and manidipine prevented the L-NAME-induced increase in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA content, thereby restoring control levels in the aorta. On the other hand, hydralazine treatment had no such effect in L-NAME treated rats. Furthermore, the increased expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) by L-NAME treatment was not affected by amlodipine, manidipine, or hydralazine. We concluded that the direct anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of calcium channel blockades in the aorta of rats with L-NAME-induced hypertension were not likely to have been mediated by the blood pressure-lowering action of these agents, but instead these beneficial effects appear to have been mediated by an augmentation of eNOS expression and by the inhibition of the expression of ACE.", 
    "865": "We examined the histochemical characteristics of soleus muscle in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene (Ace in mice, ACE in humans) knockout mice. Serial sections of soleus muscle of wild-type (Ace+/+, n=20) and heterozygous mutant (Ace+/-, n=24) mice were stained for myosin adenosine triphosphatase activity to identify different muscle fiber types. Capillaries were visualized by amylase-periodic acid-Schiff staining. ACE activity in the serum and gastrocnemius muscle was higher in male mice than in female mice. Female and male Ace+/- mice had markedly lower ACE activity in the serum and the gastrocnemius muscle than did female and male Ace+/+ mice, respectively. In both male and female mice, the composition of fiber types (type I and IIa) did not differ significantly between Ace+/+ and Ace+/- mice. There was no significant gender difference in capillary density. Ace+/- mice had significantly more capillaries around type IIa fibers (5.44 +/- 0.18 vs. 5.01 +/- 0.13, p<0.05) than Ace+/+ mice. The differences in the number of capillaries around type I fibers and in the number of capillaries around per fiber (capillary:fiber ratio) between Ace+/- and Ace+/+ mice were not significant (p<0.1). There was no significant difference in the mean cross-sectional area occupied by one capillary and the number of capillaries per fiber area between Ace+/+ and Ace+/- mice. In conclusion, knockout of the Ace gene in mice increased capillary density, as expressed by the mean number of capillaries around type IIa fibers. This finding suggests a possible mechanism for the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors."
